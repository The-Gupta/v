Previously, we cloned several species of MLL/MEN chimeric cDNAs in a patient with myeloid leukemia carrying the t(11;19)(q23;p13.1) translocation. The MEN sequence directly followed the 5' region of MLL cDNA in some species and otherwise there presented an inserted sequence of 120 bp between the MLL and MEN sequences in others. Because the insertion sequence contained an in-frame termination codon, they coded only for the NH2-terminal part of MLL (truncated MLL). We also cloned the normal MEN cDNA in full-length with a cDNA library derived from K562 cells. We expressed the normal MEN, MLL/MEN chimeric and truncated MLL proteins in COS7 cells with the corresponding cDNAs and detected them with antibodies raised against the MEN and MLL peptides. Immunostaining and subcellular fractionation showed nuclear localization of all these proteins. These findings suggested that MLL/MEN chimeric cDNAs were actually translated into both MLL/MEN fusion and truncated MLL proteins and that they were localized in the nucleus of leukemic cells. Recently, Conaway et al. reported that MEN is an RNA polymerase II elongation factor.

In this paper, the effects of histamine H2 receptor agonist 4-methylhistamine (4-MH) and its antagonist ranitidine (Ranit) on the growth of PB CFU-GM cultured in methylcellulose system were studied and their differential effects on normal PB CFU-GM and leukemic HL-60 cells were compared with the effect of the antineoplastic agent cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C). It was found that the histamine H2 receptor agonist 4-MH stimulated the growth of PB CFU-GM when 4-MH was added at the concentrations from 10(-9) mol.L-1 to 10(-6) mol.L-1 among which the dose 10(-8) mol.L-1 exerted most potent stimulating effect (the PB CFU-GM colony numbers was 137.68% +/- 8.20% vs the control, P < 0.01). In contrast, the antagonist Ranit showed inhibitory effect on the growth of PB CFU-GM when at the concentrations 10(-9)-10(-5) mol.L-1 cultured for 14 d in the same methylcellulose system. The inhibition rate was 23.73% +/- 1.16% (10(-9) mol.L-1) and 41.42% +/- 6.75% (10(-6) mol.L-1), respectively. Although both Ranit and Ara-C could inhibit the growth of PB CFU-GM in vitro, Ranit exerted much greater inhibition on HL-60 leukemic cells than on normal PB CFU-GM at the dose of 10(-6) mol.L-1 (100% inhibition for HL-60 and < 50% inhibition for PB CFU-GM). However, the inhibition rate of Ara-C for both HL-60 and PB CFU-GM was 100% at the intensive chemotherapeutic dose of 10(-5) mol.L-1. It would appear that the histamine H2 receptor agonist 4-MH possesses stimulating effect on the growth of PB CFU-GM similar to its effect on CFU-GM from bone marrow as documented before. It is suggested that the histamine H2 receptor antagonist Ranit has, to some extent, potential in the treatment of myeloid leukemia, especially when combined with antineoplastic agent Ara-C at suboptimal doses.","['He, Q', 'Xu, Y H']","['He Q', 'Xu YH']","['Research Laboratory of Blood Physiology, Human Medical University, Changsha.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Yao Xue Xue Bao,Yao xue xue bao = Acta pharmaceutica Sinica,21710340R,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Histamine Agonists)', '0 (Histamine H2 Antagonists)', '0 (Methylhistamines)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '884KT10YB7 (Ranitidine)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cytarabine/*pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells/drug effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects', 'Histamine Agonists/*pharmacology', 'Histamine H2 Antagonists/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Methylhistamines/*pharmacology', 'Ranitidine/*pharmacology']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Yao Xue Xue Bao. 1996;31(5):340-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CONCLUSION: The results demonstrated that transfection of IL-4 and/or M-CSF gene into macrophages could augment their anti-tumor immunity.","['Yu, Y', 'Cao, X', 'Lei, H']","['Yu Y', 'Cao X', 'Lei H']","['Department of Immunology, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua yi xue za zhi,7511141,"['207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', '81627-83-0 (Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['*Adenoviruses, Human/genetics', 'Animals', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Interleukin-4/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Leukemia L1210/pathology', 'Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Macrophages, Peritoneal/immunology/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', '*Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/07/01 00:00,1996/07/01 00:01,['1996/07/01 00:00'],"['1996/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi. 1996 Jul;76(7):493-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A Mel-resistant variant of the leukemic cell line (K562/Mel) was developed in vitro by continuous exposure to Mel. The level of expression of several resistance-related gene in K562/Mel and the effect of reversal of resistance to Mel by IFN alpha were observed. RESULTS: K562/Mel was 8.0-fold resistant to Mel and also cross-resistant to nitrogen mustand and thiophosphoramide, but not to carmustine and doxorubicin. This enhanced Mel resistance was associated with increased level of GST alpha gene and total GST, but not with increased level of expression of GST pi, GST mu, MDR-1 and Top-II gene. IFN alpha, at 500 IU/ml, a noncytotoxic dosage significantly increased the cytotoxicity of Mel to K562/Mel. The reversal of Mel resistance is related to the decrease of the level of expression of GST alpha gene. CONCLUSION: Resistance to Mel is associated with increased level of GST alpha gene and total GST in leukemic cell. IFN alpha can reverse Mel resistance.","['Qian, Q', 'Yan, W', 'Yang, C Z']","['Qian Q', 'Yan W', 'Yang CZ']","['Institute of Hematology, Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua yi xue za zhi,7511141,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)', 'Q41OR9510P (Melphalan)']",IM,"['*Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', '*Genes, MDR', 'Glutathione Transferase/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia/genetics/*pathology', '*Melphalan', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/07/01 00:00,1996/07/01 00:01,['1996/07/01 00:00'],"['1996/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi. 1996 Jul;76(7):485-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: Clinical results showed that the time taken to reach an absolute neutrophil count > 0.5 x 10(9)/L was significantly faster in patients who received rhG-CSF compared with control patients (16.24 +/- 0.25 vs 25.20 +/- 0.16 days.

We have now used human (MG-63) and murine (MC3T3-E1) osteoblastic cell lines as well as primary murine calvaria cells to test the hypothesis that these receptors mediate effects of the cytokines on the biology of osteoblasts. We report that as in other cell types, all of the osteoblastic cell models responded to interleukin-6 (IL-6)-type cytokines with activation of both the JAK/STAT (Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription) and the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. In addition, IL-6-type cytokines stimulated alkaline phosphatase activity and osteocalcin expression and inhibited (MG-63), stimulated (MC3T3-E1), or had no effect (calvaria cells) on the rate of cell proliferation. The ability of a given cell type to respond to a particular member of this family of cytokines was strictly dependent on the presence of the corresponding ligand-binding subunit (alpha) of the cytokine receptor, and the magnitude of all the effects was closely correlated with the concentration of this subunit. The relative contribution of the JAK/STAT and MAPK pathways to the biological effects of the cytokines was evaluated using kinase inhibitors. Cytokine-mediated modulation of cell proliferation as well as stimulation of alkaline phosphatase activity were abrogated by tyrosine kinase inhibitors as well as a threonine/serine kinase inhibitor, but were only minimally affected by a specific inhibitor of MAPK phosphorylation. These results demonstrate that IL-6-type cytokines, besides their osteoclastogenic properties, promote differentiation of committed osteoblastic cells toward a more mature phenotype and that this action is mediated primarily via the activation of the JAK/STAT pathway.","['Bellido, T', 'Borba, V Z', 'Roberson, P', 'Manolagas, S C']","['Bellido T', 'Borba VZ', 'Roberson P', 'Manolagas SC']","['Center for Osteoporosis and Metabolic Bone Diseases, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, and the McClellan Veterans Administration Medical Center, Little Rock 72205, USA.

In this study, the differential staining cytotoxicity (DiSC) assay was used to assess the efficacy of the novel antitumour cAMP analogue, 8-chloro-cAMP (8-Cl-cAMP) (and its metabolite 8-Cl-adenosine) against 107 fresh specimens of human neoplastic and normal cells. Diagnoses included chronic and acute leukaemias, myeloma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and miscellaneous solid tumours. The aim was to identify targets for subsequent phase I, II and III trials. 8-Cl-cAMP was tested at 4-985 microM, along with standard chemotherapeutic drugs. 8-Cl-cAMP and its metabolite caused no morphologically observable cell differentiation but induced dose-dependent cytotoxicity. Compared with untreated patients, previously treated chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) patients showed no increase in ex vivo resistance to 8-Cl-cAMP (P = 0.878); minimal cross-resistance with other cytotoxic drugs was detected. Compared with normal cells (mean LC90 = 1803 microM), 8-Cl-cAMP showed significant ex vivo activity against CLL (117.0 microM; P < 0.0001) and NHL (140.0 microM; P < 0.0001), of which eight were mantle cell NHL (84.7 microM), and greatest activity against cells from patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML; mean LC90 = 24.3 microM; in vitro therapeutic index 74-fold, P < 0.0001). Solid tumour specimens were comparatively resistant to 8-Cl-cAMP. The results highlight the clinical potential of 8-Cl-cAMP, point to several new phase I, II and III trial possibilities and provide a rationale for the inclusion of ex vivo cytotoxic drug evaluation in the drug development process.","['Bosanquet, A G', 'Burlton, A R', 'Bell, P B', 'Harris, A L']","['Bosanquet AG', 'Burlton AR', 'Bell PB', 'Harris AL']","['Bath Cancer Research Unit, School of Postgraduate Medicine, University of Bath, Royal United Hospital, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '146-77-0 (2-Chloroadenosine)', '23583-48-4 (8-Bromo Cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate)', 'BQ94Z7E5OR (8-chloro-cyclic adenosine monophosphate)', 'PA05MFH3I7 (8-chloroadenosine)']",IM,"['2-Chloroadenosine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', '8-Bromo Cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Drug Evaluation', 'Drug Resistance', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy']",1997/01/01 00:00,1997/01/01 00:01,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/bjc.1997.417 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1997;76(4):511-8. doi: 10.1038/bjc.1997.417.,,,,,PMC2227987,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our results showed that, despite its marked structural similarities to temozolomide, PYRZ presents properties that are atypical of 1,2,3-triazene-containing alkylating agents. In a Maxam-Gilbert DNA sequencing assay, PYRZ showed background levels of DNA alkylation, in contrast to temozolomide which strongly alkylated DNA preferentially at guanine residues. At high concentrations, PYRZ inhibited the synthesis of DNA, RNA and protein 3 h after treatment, in contrast to temozolomide which, in previous work, was found to preferentially inhibit DNA synthesis in OVCAR-3 cells. In cells exposed to PYRZ, alkaline sucrose density-gradient centrifugation showed a dose-dependent increase in DNA fragmentation only 12 and 24 h after treatment. PYRZ induced increasing accumulation of cells in late S and G2+M 6-24 h after treatment. This also contrasts with previous work that showed delayed cell cycle arrest induced by temozolomide in OVCAR-3 cells and in the murine leukaemia L1210 cells. Cell-killing kinetics by PYRZ showed a series of sigmoidal dose-response curves with 50-90% cell killing attained as early as 24 h after treatment in the 25-100 microM dose range.

Vitamin D analogues, such as the deltanoids, are being evaluated as differentiation agents in the treatment of several human cancers (e.g., myeloid leukemias); however, these compounds have a tendency to produce hypercalcemia in patients receiving therapy. A combination of a differentiation-inducing deltanoid with a compound that blocks entry of calcium into cells (e.g., ketoconazole) may offer a new approach to differentiation therapy and address the problem of hypercalcemia. We investigated whether various ketoconazole-deltanoid combinations would alter cellular differentiation or intracellular calcium homeostasis in comparison with deltanoids used alone. METHODS: Cultured human leukemia HL60 cells were treated with ketoconazole-deltanoid combinations. Markers of differentiation (expression of CD11b and CD14 antigens and of non-specific esterase) were measured by flow cytometry and cytochemistry; cell cycle distribution was measured by flow cytometry of propidium iodide-stained cells. Expression of differentiation-related genes was assessed by northern blotting and immunoblotting, and changes in intracellular calcium homeostasis were monitored by fluorescence analysis of fura-2-containing cells. RESULTS: Ketoconazole strongly potentiated the differentiating activity of the deltanoids, which exhibited low potency when used alone. Ketoconazole-deltanoid combinations had little effect on HL60 cell-cycle distribution, although the cells did stop proliferating and they differentiated. Ketoconazole-deltanoid combinations produced only minor changes in intracellular calcium homeostasis compared with changes produced by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, either alone or in combination with ketoconazole. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that ketoconazole may be useful in combination with vitamin D analogues in the differentiation therapy for myeloid leukemias.","['Wang, X', 'Gardner, J P', 'Kheir, A', 'Uskokovic, M R', 'Studzinski, G P']","['Wang X', 'Gardner JP', 'Kheir A', 'Uskokovic MR', 'Studzinski GP']","['Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine, UMDNJ-New Jersey Medical School, Newark 07103, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CD11 Antigens)', '0 (Calcium Channels)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharide Receptors)', '1406-16-2 (Vitamin D)', '66772-14-3 (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D)', 'R9400W927I (Ketoconazole)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis', 'CD11 Antigens/analysis', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Calcium Channels/*drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'HL-60 Cells/*drug effects/immunology', 'Humans', 'Ketoconazole/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy', 'Lipopolysaccharide Receptors/analysis', 'Monocytes/drug effects', 'Vitamin D/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology']",1997/08/20 00:00,1997/08/20 00:01,['1997/08/20 00:00'],"['1997/08/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/08/20 00:01 [medline]', '1997/08/20 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/jnci/89.16.1199 [doi]'],ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1997 Aug 20;89(16):1199-206. doi: 10.1093/jnci/89.16.1199.,,,"['CA44722/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL44196/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Whereas mast cells cannot intrinsically express immunologically specific functions, the binding of IgE to high-affinity IgE receptors (Fc epsilonRI) on the surface of mast cells primes these cells to secrete cytokines and other biologically active products upon subsequent exposure to specific antigens. We now report that both HMC-1, a growth factor-independent human mast cell leukemia cell line, and growth factor-dependent human umbilical cord blood-derived mast cells can secrete the multifunctional C-C chemokine, macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha (MIP-1alpha). In addition, we found that in vitro exposure of human umbilical cord blood-derived mast cells to concentrations of IgE within the range observed in the serum of subjects with allergic diseases or parasite infections, which markedly up-regulates the ability of these cells to bind IgE to their surface, also significantly enhances the ability of the cells to secrete MIP-1alpha upon subsequent passive sensitization with IgE and challenge with anti-IgE. Thus, IgE-dependent enhancement of human mast cell IgE-binding ability permits these cells to respond to Fc epsilonRI-dependent challenge with significantly increased secretion of MIP-1alpha, a chemokine that can have diverse functions in inflammation, allergic reactions, and host responses to infection.","['Yano, K', 'Yamaguchi, M', 'de Mora, F', 'Lantz, C S', 'Butterfield, J H', 'Costa, J J', 'Galli, S J']","['Yano K', 'Yamaguchi M', 'de Mora F', 'Lantz CS', 'Butterfield JH', 'Costa JJ', 'Galli SJ']","['Department of Pathology, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02215, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Lab Invest,Laboratory investigation; a journal of technical methods and pathology,0376617,"['0 (Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic)', '0 (Chemokine CCL3)', '0 (Chemokine CCL4)', '0 (Macrophage Inflammatory Proteins)', '0 (anti-IgE antibodies)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic/*physiology', 'Chemokine CCL3', 'Chemokine CCL4', 'Histamine Release', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin E/*physiology', 'Macrophage Inflammatory Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Mast Cells/*metabolism']",1997/08/01 00:00,1997/08/01 00:01,['1997/08/01 00:00'],"['1997/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Lab Invest. 1997 Aug;77(2):185-93.,,,"['AI/CA-23990/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA/AI-72074/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-56383/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ADF/TRX is a conserved multifunctional reductant presumably associated with redox regulation of the cellular environment; it works in vitro as a cytokine, free radical scavenger, activator of transcription factors, and substrate for several enzymes. In the present series of experiments, we studied the expression and intracellular localization of ADF/TRX in mouse kidney from two different renal tubular injury models: a free radical-associated model with ferric nitrilotriacetate (Fe-NTA) and a free radical-independent model with HgCl2. Markers of oxidative damage, such as 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine, thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances, and 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal-modified proteins, were significantly increased in kidney from male C57B/6 mice 1 hour after a single intraperitoneal injection of Fe-NTA (5 mg iron/kg). However, in kidney from mice given a subcutaneous injection of HgCl2 (5 mg Hg/kg), none of these markers were increased, despite tubular necrosis with sulfhydryl depletion. In the Fe-NTA model only, Northern and Western blot analyses of the kidney revealed induction of ADF/TRX (> 2.5-fold) after 16 hours and translocation of ADF/TRX from the cytoplasmic to nuclear fraction (> 3.5-fold) after 24 hours. Immunohistochemistry showed a patchy distribution of ADF/TRX in the normal renal proximal tubules. In ex vivo experiments using serial normal kidney frozen sections, it was found that renal proximal tubules with low expression of ADF/TRX were more vulnerable to oxidative stress mediated by Fe-NTA. Collectively, these data suggest that: (a) ADF/TRX is induced and translocated to nuclei by oxidative damage mediated by Fe-NTA in the renal proximal tubules; (b) induction of ADF/TRX is independent of tubular necrosis or sulfhydryl depletion; and (c) ADF/TRX is involved in the cellular defense mechanisms in vivo against oxidative damage.","['Tanaka, T', 'Nishiyama, Y', 'Okada, K', 'Hirota, K', 'Matsui, M', 'Yodoi, J', 'Hiai, H', 'Toyokuni, S']","['Tanaka T', 'Nishiyama Y', 'Okada K', 'Hirota K', 'Matsui M', 'Yodoi J', 'Hiai H', 'Toyokuni S']","['Department of Pathology and Biology of Diseases, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Lab Invest,Laboratory investigation; a journal of technical methods and pathology,0376617,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Ferric Compounds)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Sulfhydryl Compounds)', '0 (adult T cell leukemia-derived factor)', '52500-60-4 (Thioredoxins)', '53GH7MZT1R (Mercuric Chloride)', ""88847-89-6 (8-Hydroxy-2'-Deoxyguanosine)"", 'G9481N71RO (Deoxyguanosine)', 'KA90006V9D (Nitrilotriacetic Acid)', 'Z3U5ED15B9 (ferric nitrilotriacetate)']",IM,"[""8-Hydroxy-2'-Deoxyguanosine"", 'Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cytokines/*metabolism', 'Deoxyguanosine/analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'Ferric Compounds/toxicity', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Kidney Tubules/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Lipid Peroxidation', 'Male', 'Mercuric Chloride/toxicity', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Necrosis', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Nitrilotriacetic Acid/analogs & derivatives/toxicity', '*Oxidative Stress', 'Sulfhydryl Compounds/*analysis', 'Thioredoxins/*metabolism']",1997/08/01 00:00,1997/08/01 00:01,['1997/08/01 00:00'],"['1997/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Lab Invest. 1997 Aug;77(2):145-55.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The development of the test was carried out on virus isolates grown in tissue culture prior to cDNA synthesis and PCR using various sets of primers. Primers P33 and P32 were used for the consensus PCR to detect FMDV regardless of the serotype. Positive cDNA was assayed in two multi-primer PCR mixes containing type-specific primers capable of distinguishing between the seven serotypes. The serotype-specific primers were selected to correspond to regions of the genome coding for parts of the VP1 polypeptide that is responsible for the antigenic diversity of the virus group. Multi-primer mix P33-P(A-C-O-ASIA 1) gave products of 732, 596, 402, 292 bp for the A,C,O and ASIA 1 serotypes, respectively, and no target products for South African Territories serotypes (SAT 1, SAT 2 and SAT 3). The multi-primer mix P33-P(A-C-O-ASIA 1) was also capable of detecting a mixture of two different serotypes. Multi-primer mix P1-P(SAT 1-3-2) gave products of 246, 201 and 75 bp for the SAT 1, SAT 3 and SAT 2 serotypes, respectively, and no specific products for serotypes A, C, O and ASIA 1. This is the first PCR assay to be described that differentiates between the SAT serotypes of FMDV. The method has been applied to 25 cell-culture-derived isolates of the SAT serotypes of FMDV and the results were totally compatible with the standard techniques for FMDV detection and serotyping.","['Callens, M', 'De Clercq, K']","['Callens M', 'De Clercq K']","['National Institute for Veterinary Research, Brussels (Ukkel), Belgium. mical@var.fgov.be']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,J Virol Methods,Journal of virological methods,8005839,"['0 (Capsid Proteins)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (VP1 protein, Foot-and-mouth disease virus)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Aphthovirus/*classification/genetics', 'Capsid/genetics', 'Capsid Proteins', 'Cross Reactions', 'DNA Primers', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/enzymology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'RNA, Viral/*analysis', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase', 'Serotyping/methods', 'Species Specificity']",1997/08/01 00:00,1997/08/01 00:01,['1997/08/01 00:00'],"['1997/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0166093497000748 [pii]', '10.1016/s0166-0934(97)00074-8 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol Methods. 1997 Aug;67(1):35-44. doi: 10.1016/s0166-0934(97)00074-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 1995; 92: 7297-7301). To combine the promising DNA delivering activity of PEI with the concept of receptor-mediated gene delivery, cell-binding ligands (transferrin or antiCD3 antibody) were incorporated by covalent linkage to PEI. DNA complexes of PEI or ligand-PEI conjugates were tested for transfection of cultured neuroblastoma Neuro 2A cells, melanoma B16 or H225 cells, erythroid leukemic K562 cells and T cell leukemia Jurkat E6.1 cells. Depending on the cell line, incorporation of the cell-binding ligand resulted in an up to 1000-fold increased transfection efficiency. This activity depends on ligand-receptor interaction and was observed also at low PEI cation:DNA anion ratios where ligand-free PEI lacks efficiency. Depending on the cell-binding ligand, specific targeting (CD3 antibody, Jurkat cells) can be achieved. Gene transfer can be augmented by the addition of an endosome-destabilizing influenza peptide, but is not dependent on the presence of additional endosomolytic agents.

Chronic sinusitis was found in two patients, mucosal swelling not requesting therapy in 22, and normal findings in 39. CONCLUSION: CT of the paranasal sinuses is advised in patients suffering haemoblastoses with an increased risk of infectious complications during the transplantation phase, because pathological findings can be expected in 21% of the patients.

This strict segregation has been reconsidered in recent reports in which exogenous antigens are shown to be presented by MHC class I molecules in the phagocytic pathway. In this report, the presentation pathway of an exogenously added highly antigenic polypeptide encoded by the murine AIDS (MAIDS) defective virus gag p12 gene is investigated. A 25-mer polypeptide (P12-25) encoded within the gag p12 region of the MAIDS defective virus was found to be effective in stimulating unprimed B6 (H-2b) CD8+ T cells in vitro. The presentation of P12-25 is sensitive to cytochalasin B and D, brefeldin A and gelonin, a ribosome-inactivating protein synthesis inhibitor, but less sensitive or resistant to lactacystin, a highly specific inhibitor of the proteasome. Interestingly, CA-074, a selective inhibitor of cathepsin B, inhibited presentation of the polypeptide, indicating its involvement in the degradation of the P12-25 polypeptide. In fact, when P12-25 was digested with purified cathepsin B in vitro, a highly antigenic 11-mer peptide containing the class I (H-2Db)-binding motif was obtained. Our results favor the phagosome/macropinosome-to-cytosol-to-endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-to-cell surface pathway for exogenous antigens presented by MHC class I molecules. These findings may be relevant to exploiting peptide vaccines that specifically elicit CD8+ T cell immunity in vivo.","['Yee, S T', 'Okada, Y', 'Ogasawara, K', 'Omura, S', 'Takatsuki, A', 'Kakiuchi, T', 'Muno, D', 'Kominami, E', 'Mizuochi, T']","['Yee ST', 'Okada Y', 'Ogasawara K', 'Omura S', 'Takatsuki A', 'Kakiuchi T', 'Muno D', 'Kominami E', 'Mizuochi T']","['Department of Bacterial and Blood Products, National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Australia,Microbiol Immunol,Microbiology and immunology,7703966,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Cyclopentanes)', '0 (Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Dipeptides)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (H-2 Antigens)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Nucleic Acid Synthesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Plant Proteins)', '0 (Protein Synthesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Ribosome Inactivating Proteins, Type 1)', '133343-34-7 (lactacystin)', '134448-10-5 (N-(3-propylcarbamoyloxirane-2-carbonyl)-isoleucyl-proline)', '20350-15-6 (Brefeldin A)', '22144-77-0 (Cytochalasin D)', '3CHI920QS7 (Cytochalasin B)', '75037-46-6 (GEL protein, Gelonium multiflorum)', 'EC 3.4.22.1 (Cathepsin B)', 'WYQ7N0BPYC (Acetylcysteine)']",IM,"['Acetylcysteine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antigen Presentation', 'Antiviral Agents/pharmacology', 'Brefeldin A', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Cathepsin B/metabolism', 'Cyclopentanes/pharmacology', 'Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Cytochalasin B/pharmacology', 'Cytochalasin D/pharmacology', 'Dipeptides/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Gene Products, gag/genetics/*immunology', 'H-2 Antigens/immunology', 'Interleukin-2/metabolism', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics/*immunology', 'Major Histocompatibility Complex/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Murine Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/genetics/*immunology', 'Nucleic Acid Synthesis Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Plant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Protein Synthesis Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Ribosome Inactivating Proteins, Type 1']",1997/01/01 00:00,1997/01/01 00:01,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1348-0421.1997.tb01892.x [doi]'],ppublish,Microbiol Immunol. 1997;41(7):563-70. doi: 10.1111/j.1348-0421.1997.tb01892.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the current study, we examined the effect of different cytokines on the proliferation of ramified microglia in vitro using a combination of autoradiography for [3H]-thymidine and immunocytochemical techniques. Ramified microglia were obtained using a 10-day co-culture on top of a confluent astrocyte monolayer. Addition of macrophage colony-stimulating factor (MCSF), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GMCSF), and interleukin-3 (IL3), stimulated the proliferation of ramified microglia, with a 7.2-fold, 3.5-fold, and 1.5-fold increase, respectively. Of all the other cytokines tested (IL1, IL2, IL4, IL6, IL10, interferon-gamma (IFNgamma), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha) only IL1 strongly enhanced proliferation. However, this effect of IL1 was indirect and could be neutralized by antibodies against MCSF and GMCSF. IL2, IL4, IL10, TNFalpha, and IFNgamma inhibited microglial proliferation. The great number of inhibitory cytokines could point to the importance of containing microglial proliferation in the central nervous system.","['Kloss, C U', 'Kreutzberg, G W', 'Raivich, G']","['Kloss CU', 'Kreutzberg GW', 'Raivich G']","['Max-Planck-Institute for Psychiatry, Department of Neuromorphology, Martinsreid, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Neurosci Res,Journal of neuroscience research,7600111,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Astrocytes/cytology/*drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytokines/*pharmacology', 'Depression, Chemical', 'Microglia/cytology/*drug effects', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Stimulation, Chemical']",1997/07/15 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1997/07/15 00:00'],"['1997/07/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1997/07/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/(SICI)1097-4547(19970715)49:2<248::AID-JNR13>3.0.CO;2-X [pii]'],ppublish,J Neurosci Res. 1997 Jul 15;49(2):248-54.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These two compounds suppress the enzymatic activity of DPP-IV/CD26 in a competitive and reversible manner. Pretreatment of CEM cells with either of the compounds yielded a marked albeit transient reduction of HIV infection, as measured by HIV1 p24 production, RT activity and syncytium formation. The ID50 value of the Phe-Pyrr-2-CN and Arg(PMC)-pyrr-2-CN in HIV1 inhibition was 5.3 microM and 2.4 microM, respectively. Administration of either of the DPP-IV/CD26 inhibitors 1 h after HIV1 infection did not suppress HIV1 production. An analog whose inhibitory activity toward DPP-IV/CD26 was abolished by blocking the N-terminal of Phe-pyrr-2-CN with the 9-fluorenymethyloxycarbonyl (Fmoc) group had no effect on HIV1 infection. An additive effect of HIV1 inhibition was observed in combinations of either of the DPP-IV/CD26 inhibitors with CD4 monoclonal antibody. These results suggest that DPP-IV/CD26 enzymatic activity may play a role in facilitating HIV1 infection of human CD4+T cells at the entry process. DPP-IV/CD26 inhibitors may therefore have potential use in combination with other drugs to prevent HIV1 transmission.","['Jiang, J D', 'Wilk, S', 'Li, J', 'Zhang, H', 'Bekesi, J G']","['Jiang JD', 'Wilk S', 'Li J', 'Zhang H', 'Bekesi JG']","['Department of Medicine, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, NY 10029, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",France,Res Virol,Research in virology,8907469,"['0 (Anti-HIV Agents)', '0 (HIV Core Protein p24)', '0 (Protease Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrrolidines)', '0 (arginyl(PMC)-pyrrolidine-2-nitrile)', '0 (phenylalanyl-pyrrolidine-2-nitrile)', '47E5O17Y3R (Phenylalanine)', '94ZLA3W45F (Arginine)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (HIV Reverse Transcriptase)', 'EC 3.4.14.5 (Dipeptidyl Peptidase 4)']",IM,"['Anti-HIV Agents/*pharmacology', 'Arginine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology/toxicity', 'Cell Fusion/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dipeptidyl Peptidase 4/*metabolism', 'HIV Core Protein p24/analysis', 'HIV Reverse Transcriptase/analysis', 'HIV-1/*drug effects/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell', 'Phenylalanine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology/toxicity', 'Protease Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Pyrrolidines/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/*virology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/07/01 00:00,1997/07/01 00:01,['1997/07/01 00:00'],"['1997/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0923251697883628 [pii]', '10.1016/s0923-2516(97)88362-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Res Virol. 1997 Jul-Aug;148(4):255-66. doi: 10.1016/s0923-2516(97)88362-8.,,,"['MH-00350/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', 'NS-17392/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although cure for the majority of stage III NSCLC and effectively all stage IV disease patients remains rare, a number of compounds, including carboplatin, paclitaxel, docetaxel, irinotecan, and vinorelbine, have proved useful in the treatment of these patients. Together with a number of phase II trials, phase I trials utilizing escalating doses of carboplatin and paclitaxel with growth factor or growth factor and blood stem-cell support have shown that substantial increases in dose intensity can be achieved. These studies in small numbers of patients have demonstrated that these regimens have encouraging activity and have formed the basis of a Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) phase II pilot study. This study will utilize two cycles of high-dose carboplatin and Taxol given at an AUC dose of 18 and a 24-h infusion dose of 250 mg/m2, respectively, with growth factor and stem-cell support to treat stage III NSCLC patients. Patients will also receive multimodality therapy, including radiation with or without surgery.

Patients eligible for the study included those who had T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), lymphoblastic lymphoma (LBL), mantle-cell lymphoma (MCL), high-risk aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), and adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) in first complete remission (CR) and those who had standard-risk aggressive NHL, indolent lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease, or acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) in second CR or first partial remission (PR) after the completion of first-line chemotherapy and were chemosensitive to salvage chemotherapy, in whom tumor contamination of harvested peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCs) was possible due to bone marrow or peripheral blood involvement. Lack of CD34 expression by tumor cells was an important selection factor. Eight patients with hematological malignancies (six NHL patients, one ATLL patients, and one APL patient) were enrolled; their median age was 41 years (range 26-49 years). After consolidation and mobilization chemotherapy, two or three courses of apheresis were performed in each patient.

Tumor contamination as measured using a polymerase chain reaction-mediated RNase protection assay at the 10-4 level was detected in the CD34(+)-purified fractions of 2 of the 5 samples analyzed; however, a reduction in contaminating lymphoma cells from the autograft of at least 1,000 to 10,000 orders of magnitude was achieved by CD34+ selection using the immunomagnetic bead method. High-dose chemoradiotherapy with transplantation of CD34+ PBSCs purified by the immunomagnetic bead method was thus shown to be an active and safe therapy for refractory hematological malignancies with bone marrow or peripheral blood involvement.

We report the therapeutic results of treatment of patients with aggressive ATL undertaken between 1986 and 1995. A total of 120 newly diagnosed patients with a performance status of 0-3 and aged < 70 years at diagnosis were entered into the study. Clinical features, including clinical subtypes, serum levels of lactate dehydrogenase and blood urea nitrogen, the response to chemotherapy, and doses of individual chemotherapeutic agents, were evaluated. Of the 120 patients enrolled, 97 had acute-type and 23 lymphoma-type ATL. The complete response rate and median survival of these patients were 25.3% and 9 months, respectively. The 2- and 5-year survival rates were 18.4% and 8%, respectively, and five patients have been alive for > 5 years and are disease-free. These long-term survivors had good prognostic factors at diagnosis. There was no correlation between the doses of the various chemotherapeutic agents and the survival duration. These results indicate that ordinary combined chemotherapy has limited ability to improve the prognosis of aggressive ATL. Our previous study indicated that expression of P-glycoprotein in ATL cells might be involved in resistance to chemotherapeutic agents, particularly doxorubicin, vincristine, and etoposide. Therefore, new therapeutic strategies will be necessary to improve the prognosis of ATL patients.","['Hanada, S', 'Utsunomiya, A', 'Suzuki, S', 'Uozumi, K', 'Makino, T', 'Arima, T']","['Hanada S', 'Utsunomiya A', 'Suzuki S', 'Uozumi K', 'Makino T', 'Arima T']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Kagoshima University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",1997/01/01 00:00,1997/01/01 00:01,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s002800051061 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 1997;40 Suppl:S47-50. doi: 10.1007/s002800051061.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, ATRA resistance has become a major clinical problem. This limitation has prompted the development of alternative agents with desirable pharmacologic properties. We describe (1) our recent clinical trial using the new synthetic retinoid Am80 to overcome acquired resistance to ATRA and (2) basic in vitro effects of arsenic trioxide, a possible alternative to ATRA, on APL cells. A total of 19 APL patients who had relapsed after ATRA-induced complete remissions (CRs) received 6 mg/m2 Am80 p.o. daily until CR; 11 (58%) patients achieved a CR between days 20 and 58 (median day 37). The in vitro sensitivity to Am80, based on PML immunostaining, correlated well with the clinical effect in all patients tested. All three patients whose blasts were sensitive to Am80 in vitro despite a poor response to ATRA achieved CRs. Thus, Am80 might be an effective compound for the treatment of refractory APL and is a promising alternative retinoid. Since arsenic compounds have reportedly induced CRs in APL patients in China, we studied the in vitro effect of arsenic and other metal ions on myeloid leukemia cell lines. The effects of arsenic were limited mainly to APL cells, and the arsenic concentration was critical for the APL cell line NB4: 1 microM As3+ induced time-dependent apoptosis, whereas 0.1 microM As3+ allowed partial NB4 cell differentiation. Arsenic trioxide was equally effective when used on ATRA-resistant NB4 cells. Among the clinical leukemia samples tested, the in vitro cytotoxic effects of As3+ were observed selectively in APL cells, regardless of their ATRA sensitivity. These data suggest that APL cells are sensitive to As3+ and that As3+ acts on APL cells via a different pathway to ATRA.","['Kitamura, K', 'Kiyoi, H', 'Yoshida, H', 'Tobita, T', 'Takeshita, A', 'Ohno, R', 'Naoe, T']","['Kitamura K', 'Kiyoi H', 'Yoshida H', 'Tobita T', 'Takeshita A', 'Ohno R', 'Naoe T']","['Department of Medicine, Nagoya University School of Medicine Branch Hospital, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Benzoates)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Retinoids)', '0 (Tetrahydronaphthalenes)', '08V52GZ3H9 (tamibarotene)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Benzoates/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Oxides/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Retinoids/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Tetrahydronaphthalenes/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/01/01 00:00,1997/01/01 00:01,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s002800051059 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 1997;40 Suppl:S36-41. doi: 10.1007/s002800051059.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the AML-92 study, patients were scheduled to receive 45 mg/ m2 oral ATRA daily until achievement of a complete remission (CR). If patients had initial leukocyte counts of > 3.0 x 10(9)/l, they received 40 mg/m2 daunorubicin (DNR) for 3 days and 200 mg/m2 behenoyl cytarabine (BHAC) for 5 days in addition to ATRA. During remission induction therapy, if the patients showed peripheral blood myeloblast and promyelocyte counts of > 1.0 x 10(9)/l, they received additional DNR and BHAC on the same schedule. After achievement of a CR, patients received three courses of consolidation and six courses of maintenance/intensification chemotherapy. Of 196 evaluable patients, 173 (88%) achieved a CR: 59 of 62 (95%) treated with ATRA alone, 41 of 49 (84%) treated with ATRA plus later chemotherapy, 63 of 73 (86%) treated with ATRA plus initial chemotherapy, and 10 of 12 (83%) treated with ATRA plus both initial and later chemotherapy. The CR rate in AML-92 was significantly higher than that in AML-89, but not than that achieved in AML-87. In addition, the early mortality and relapse rates in AML-92 were significantly lower than those in AML-89, but were not than those in AML-87. At a median follow-up of 36 months the predicted 4-year event-free survival (EFS) rate for 196 evaluable patients and the 4-year disease-free survival (DFS) rate for the CR cases were 54% and 62%, respectively. There was a significant difference in DFS between AML-92 and AML-87 (P = 0.0418) but not between AML-92 and AML-89 (P = 0.0687). In contrast, significant differences in EFS between AML-92 and both AML-87 (P = 0.0129) and AML-89 (P = 0.005) were observed.

From 1990 to 1995 we used RA as remission induction therapy in 103 APL patients (73 newly diagnosed and 30 previously treated) who were retinoid-naive and were treated on the basis of initial morphology. Patients whose diagnosis was changed on the basis of the results of molecular testing (n = 13) were withdrawn from RA treatment and given chemotherapy alone. After achieving a CR, previously untreated patients received several cycles of consolidation chemotherapy, usually with idarubicin and cytosine arabinoside. Among individuals whose diagnosis was molecularly confirmed, 54 of 65 new patients (83%) and 25 of 30 previously treated patients (83%) achieved a CR. All induction failures in molecularly diagnosed cases were due either to early death or to premature withdrawal. Median disease-free and overall survival rates recorded for all newly diagnosed patients are currently > 40+ and > 43+ months, respectively. We subsequently examined a subset of 27 newly diagnosed patients treated during the first 2 years of this program whose actual median follow-up period is now > 5 years. Median disease-free and overall survival rates recorded for this group are > 57+ and > 58+ months, respectively; 56% of these patients are alive in first remission. These results significantly exceed those achieved using chemotherapy alone in a historical control group of 80 patients consecutively treated at this center from 1975 to 1990, whose median disease-free and overall survival rates were 11 and 19 months, respectively; only 22% of these patients were alive in first remission at 5 years. Although a high proportion of previously treated patients also achieved a CR after RA treatment, median disease-free and overall survival rates noted for that group were markedly lower (i.e., 7.5 and 10.9 months, respectively). Thus, data from patients whose median follow-up period is now > 5 years have confirmed earlier projections and indicate that the use of RA for remission induction yields an approximately 2.5-fold increase in the proportion of patients who have presumably been cured of this disease.","['Soignet, S', 'Fleischauer, A', 'Polyak, T', 'Heller, G', 'Warrell, R P Jr']","['Soignet S', 'Fleischauer A', 'Polyak T', 'Heller G', 'Warrell RP Jr']","['Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tretinoin/*therapeutic use']",1997/01/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s002800051057 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 1997;40 Suppl:S25-9. doi: 10.1007/s002800051057.,,,['CA-57645/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PURPOSE: The present study further investigated the relationship between multidrug resistance (MDR) mediated by P-glycoproteinMDR and potential resistance to camptothecin derivatives using two experimental systems: (1) MDR KB-V1 cells selected for vinblastine resistance, and (2) NIH3T3 cells transfected with a plasmid expressing wildtype P-glycoproteinMDR multidrug transporter (NIH-MDR-G185). RESULTS: We found that both KBV-1 and NIH-MDR-G185 cells were resistant to topotecan, and that topotecan-induced cleavable complexes were reduced in KB-V1 cells, consistent with a role of P-glycoproteinMDR in cellular resistance to topotecan. By contrast, no significant resistance to camptothecin, 9-aminocamptothecin, 10, 11-methylenedioxycamptothecin, or SN-38 (the active metabolite of CPT-11) was observed in NIH-MDR-G185 cells, while KB-V1 cells were cross-resistant to these compounds but produced cleavable complexes similar to those produced by parental KB-3-1 cells. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that topotecan is the only camptothecin tested with significant susceptibility to MDR in cell culture, and that multidrug resistant cells such as KBV1 probably exhibit additional resistance mechanisms to camptothecins besides P-glycoproteinMDR overexpression.","['Hoki, Y', 'Fujimori, A', 'Pommier, Y']","['Hoki Y', 'Fujimori A', 'Pommier Y']","['Laboratory of Molecular Pharmacology, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892-4255, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '7M7YKX2N15 (Topotecan)', 'EC 5.99.1.2 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type I)', 'XT3Z54Z28A (Camptothecin)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Western', 'Camptothecin/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type I/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'KB Cells', 'Time Factors', 'Topotecan', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",1997/01/01 00:00,1997/01/01 00:01,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s002800050682 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 1997;40(5):433-8. doi: 10.1007/s002800050682.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although Tax stabilizes the binding of CREB to the Tax-responsive viral CREs in the HTLV-1 promoter, the precise molecular mechanism by which Tax mediates strong transcriptional activation through CREB remains unclear. In this report, we show that Tax promotes high-affinity binding of the KIX domain of CREB binding protein (CBP) to CREB-viral CRE complexes, increasing the stability of KIX in these nucleoprotein complexes by up to 4.4 kcal/mol. Comparable KIX binding affinities were measured for both phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms of CREB, and in all cases high-affinity binding was dependent upon both Tax and the viral CRE. Tax also promoted association of KIX to a truncated form of CREB containing only the 73-amino-acid basic leucine zipper (bZIP) domain, indicating that the entire amino-terminal CBP-interacting domain of CREB is nonessential in the presence of Tax. Functional studies upheld the binding studies, as expression of the bZIP domain of CREB was sufficient to support Tax transactivation of HTLV-1 transcription in vivo. Finally, we show that transfection of a KIX expression plasmid, which lacks activation properties, inhibited Tax transactivation in vivo. This suggests that KIX occupies the CBP binding site on Tax, and therefore CBP is likely a cofactor in mediating Tax stimulation of HTLV-1 transcription. Together, these data support a model in which Tax anchors CBP to the HTLV-1 promoter, with strong transcriptional activation resulting from the CBP-associated activities of nucleosome remodeling and recruitment of the general transcription machinery.","['Giebler, H A', 'Loring, J E', 'van Orden, K', 'Colgin, M A', 'Garrus, J E', 'Escudero, K W', 'Brauweiler, A', 'Nyborg, J K']","['Giebler HA', 'Loring JE', 'van Orden K', 'Colgin MA', 'Garrus JE', 'Escudero KW', 'Brauweiler A', 'Nyborg JK']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Colorado State University, Fort Collins 80523-1870, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Activating Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Activating Transcription Factor 1', 'Cell Line', 'Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein/*metabolism', 'DNA/metabolism', '*DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Gene Products, tax/*genetics', 'Half-Life', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Macromolecular Substances', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Conformation', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', '*Transcriptional Activation']",1997/09/01 00:00,1997/09/01 00:01,['1997/09/01 00:00'],"['1997/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/MCB.17.9.5156 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1997 Sep;17(9):5156-64. doi: 10.1128/MCB.17.9.5156.,,,['CA-55035/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,PMC232366,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous studies suggested that methylating triazenes might have a potential role for the treatment of acute leukemias with low levels of OGAT. In the current study, we transduced the human OGAT cDNA in OGAT-deficient leukemia cell clones. OGAT-transduced cells were more resistant than their OGAT-deficient counterparts to apoptosis triggered by the methylating triazene temozolomide (TZM), as indicated by the results of flow cytometry, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase assay, and analysis of DNA fragmentation. Depletion of OGAT activity by O6-benzylguanine increased leukemia cell sensitivity to TZM-mediated apoptosis. Moreover, combined treatment of cells with TZM and benzamide, an inhibitor of the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (EC 2.4.2.30), increased the apoptosis induced by the methylating agent. These results demonstrate for the first time that methyl adducts at the O6 position of guanine, which are specifically removed by OGAT, are the principal DNA lesions responsible for the induction of apoptosis on treatment of leukemic cells with the methylating triazene TZM. This study also supports the possible use of TZM for the treatment of acute leukemias and suggests new strategies to increase the susceptibility of tumor cells to methylating triazenes in the clinic.","['Tentori, L', 'Orlando, L', 'Lacal, P M', 'Benincasa, E', 'Faraoni, I', 'Bonmassar, E', ""D'Atri, S"", 'Graziani, G']","['Tentori L', 'Orlando L', 'Lacal PM', 'Benincasa E', 'Faraoni I', 'Bonmassar E', ""D'Atri S"", 'Graziani G']","['Department of Experimental Medicine and Biochemical Sciences, University of Rome Tor Vergata, Italy. tentori@utovrm.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase Inhibitors)', '7GR28W0FJI (Dacarbazine)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.63 (O(6)-Methylguanine-DNA Methyltransferase)', 'YF1K15M17Y (Temozolomide)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'DNA Methylation', '*DNA Repair', 'DNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Dacarbazine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Methyltransferases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'O(6)-Methylguanine-DNA Methyltransferase', '*Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase Inhibitors', 'Temozolomide', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/08/01 00:00,1997/08/01 00:01,['1997/08/01 00:00'],"['1997/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1124/mol.52.2.249 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 1997 Aug;52(2):249-58. doi: 10.1124/mol.52.2.249.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have demonstrated using FISH the presence of the trisomy at all stages of the patient's disease course (including remission, peripheral blood cell harvest and relapse), whereas conventional karyoptypic analysis was only able to detect the trisomy at diagnosis and clinical relapse. We have also shown using immunophenotyping, cell sorting and FISH, that the trisomic cells in this patient were restricted to the CD34+ subset of blood and bone marrow and could not be found in the CD 34-, T or B cell compartment. Overall we have shown FISH to be a rapid, quantitative method for the detection of cells with numerical chromosome abnormalities. FISH analysis of interphase cells provides valuable information on the status of the whole population, rather than just cycling cells, and can be applied successfully to monitor the level of leukemic cells.","['White, D L', 'Hutchins, C J', 'Turczynowicz, S', 'Suttle, J', 'Haylock, D N', 'Hughes, T P', 'Juttner, C A', 'To, L B']","['White DL', 'Hutchins CJ', 'Turczynowicz S', 'Suttle J', 'Haylock DN', 'Hughes TP', 'Juttner CA', 'To LB']","['Leukemia Research Unit, Hanson Centre for Cancer Research, Adelaide, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Pathology,Pathology,0175411,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Cell Separation', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', '*Interphase', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/*pathology', 'Male', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Remission Induction', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Time Factors', '*Trisomy']",1997/08/01 00:00,1997/08/01 00:01,['1997/08/01 00:00'],"['1997/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/00313029700169115 [doi]'],ppublish,Pathology. 1997 Aug;29(3):289-93. doi: 10.1080/00313029700169115.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, it is now recognized that the cellular radiation response is complex and that radioresistance/radiosensitivity may also be regulated at different levels in the radiation signal transduction pathway. Here, we describe a direct relationship between resistance to radiation-induced apoptosis and defective ceramide signaling. Radiation sensitivity in human tumor cells correlated with the immediate accumulation of the second messenger ceramide. In the BL30A Burkitt's lymphoma line, ceramide increased 4-fold by 10 min postirradiation (10 Gy), and in the moderately sensitive HL-60 leukemia cells, ceramide accumulated 2.5-fold above basal levels. In contrast, in all radioresistant tumor cells examined, including several Burkitt's lymphoma lines (BL30K, BL29, and BL36) and the MO59K glioma cell line, ceramide did not accumulate postirradiation. The ability to abrogate ceramide production by pretreatment with the tumor promoter, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate, conferred resistance to radiation-induced apoptosis in the sensitive BL30A cells. An isogenic subline of BL30A, BL30K, was resistant to both C8-ceramide (20 microM) and ionizing radiation-induced apoptosis. Bypassing the block in radiation-induced ceramide production by the addition of exogenous ceramide was not sufficient to induce apoptosis; this suggests the existence of a second ceramide-associated signaling defect in these radioresistant cells that confers resistance to ceramide-induced apoptosis. Thus, these results provide compelling evidence that ceramide is an essential mediator of radiation-induced apoptosis and that defective ceramide signaling confers an apoptosis-resistant phenotype in tumor cells.","['Michael, J M', 'Lavin, M F', 'Watters, D J']","['Michael JM', 'Lavin MF', 'Watters DJ']","['Queensland Cancer Fund Research Unit, Queensland Institute of Medical Research, P.O.

In contrast to lovastatin, which induced cytosol localization of Ras in U-937 cells, Fmev failed to increase cytosolic Ras and also completely prevented the proliferation of U-937 cells. Growth of U-937 cells was restored by the addition of lovastatin to Fmev-blocked cells. These results implied that a product of mevalonate metabolism proximal to isopentenyl diphosphate was responsible for the suppression of proliferation. To delineate the action of this endogenous inhibitor of cell proliferation and determine the relationship between its impact on Ras localization and cell proliferation, the effect of Fmev on a variety of leukemia- and lymphoma-derived cells was examined. Whereas Fmev blocked the growth of these cell lines, there were more than 50-fold differences in the concentrations required to inhibit the growth of individual cell lines by 90%. Regardless of its effect on cell proliferation, the biochemical effect of Fmev was similar. Thus, Fmev uniformly prevented the conversion of radiolabeled mevalonate to isopentenyl diphosphate and other downstream products, including synthesis of sterol and nonsterol lipids and prenylation of proteins. A correlation was noted between higher intrinsic rates of mevalonate synthesis by a cell and susceptibility to inhibition by Fmev. Thus, sensitivity of a cell line to inhibition by Fmev was associated with markedly increased rates of HMG CoA reductase activity that were further increased by incubation with Fmev. Whereas Fmev depleted cellular levels of the prenylated protein Ras in the sensitive cell line U-937, there was no depletion of cellular Ras levels in the resistant cell line EL-4, but rather, there was a shift of Ras from membrane to cytosol, as expected for inhibition of prenylation. These results suggest that leukemic cells with increased HMG CoA reductase activity produce increased levels of an endogenous mevalonate-derived inhibitor that leads to Ras depletion and suppression of cell growth.

We previously reported that this fragmentation was a Ca2+-independent process during apoptosis, which was induced by anticancer agents in human leukemia cells. The present study demonstrated that a high molecular weight DNA fragmentation activity (HDFA) was induced in the drug-treated cells and, upon fusion of the drug-treated cells with untreated target cells prelabeled with [14C]thymidine, caused fragmentation of the labeled DNA in the target cells. Furthermore, extracts of the drug-treated cells caused high molecular weight DNA fragmentation in nuclei isolated from untreated cells. Biochemical characterization of HDFA revealed the following properties: HDFA was proteinaceous in nature, as evidenced by its inactivation by heating or by digestion with proteinase K; HDFA required Mg2+ for optimal activity but was inhibited by Zn2+ and K+; HDFA was active in vitro at pH 6.0-8.0 and was inactive under more acidic conditions (pH < 6.0); addition of ATP (0.5-2 mM) substantially potentiated HDFA activity in isolated nuclei; and HDFA was not inhibited by actin (an inhibitor of DNase I) but was inhibited by the extracts from K562 cells, which were resistant to drug-induced apoptosis. The specific inhibitor of cysteine proteases (interleukin 1beta-converting enzyme protease family) blocked the generation of drug-induced high molecular weight DNA fragmentation in whole cells, whereas in isolated nuclei, the cysteine protease inhibitors did not prevent the cleavage of chromatin by exogenous HDFA. These results suggest that, once HDFA is activated during apoptosis, it does not require the presence of cysteine proteases for its endonucleolytic activity and that the cysteine proteases may be involved in the apoptotic process upstream of the activation of HDFA in whole cells.","['Huang, P', 'Ballal, K', 'Plunkett, W']","['Huang P', 'Ballal K', 'Plunkett W']","['Department of Clinical Investigation, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Nucleosomes)', '0W860991D6 (Deoxycytidine)', '38966-21-1 (Aphidicolin)', 'B76N6SBZ8R (gemcitabine)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/metabolism', 'Aphidicolin/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Fusion', 'Cell Line', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/metabolism', '*DNA Fragmentation/drug effects/genetics', 'DNA, Neoplasm/chemistry/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Deoxycytidine/analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Pulsed-Field', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Molecular Weight', 'Nucleosomes/genetics/metabolism', 'Vidarabine/analogs & derivatives/metabolism']",1997/08/15 00:00,1997/08/15 00:01,['1997/08/15 00:00'],"['1997/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1997/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1997 Aug 15;57(16):3407-14.,,,"['CA28596/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA32839/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA55164/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we examined the in vitro effect of a chimeric protein composed of the extracellular region of a murine G-CSF receptor and the human IgG1 Fc region because a human natural soluble G-CSF receptor was not available. First, we found that this chimeric soluble G-CSF receptor could inhibit the biological activity of G-CSF on normal bone marrow colony formation. Because G-CSF also plays an important role in the proliferation of leukemic blast cells, we next examined the effect of the soluble G-CSF receptor on leukemic blast colony formation in 10 acute myeloblastic leukemia cases. Although G-CSF stimulated the proliferation of leukemic progenitor cells to form leukemic blast colonies, the chimeric soluble G-CSF receptor completely inhibited this stimulatory effect. Furthermore, the chimeric soluble G-CSF receptor also inhibited spontaneous leukemic blast colony formation in two cases. Because a high concentration of G-CSF was observed in the supernatants of leukemic blast cells from these two cases, it seems likely that the soluble G-CSF receptor cut off the autocrine growth mechanism of leukemic blast cells mediated by G-CSF. These findings suggest the possibility that the soluble G-CSF receptor could be used in a clinical application for acute myeloblastic leukemia patients in the future.","['Asano, Y', 'Yokoyama, T', 'Shibata, S', 'Kobayashi, S', 'Shimoda, K', 'Nakashima, H', 'Okamura, S', 'Niho, Y']","['Asano Y', 'Yokoyama T', 'Shibata S', 'Kobayashi S', 'Shimoda K', 'Nakashima H', 'Okamura S', 'Niho Y']","['The First Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Fc Fragments)', '0 (Receptors, Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blast Crisis/*pathology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Humans', '*Immunoglobulin Fc Fragments', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Mice', '*Receptors, Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/chemistry/*pharmacology']",1997/08/15 00:00,1997/08/15 00:01,['1997/08/15 00:00'],"['1997/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1997/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1997 Aug 15;57(16):3395-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has recently been proposed that induction of Fas ligand (FasL) expression with subsequent autocrine and/or paracrine induction of cell death through binding to the Fas (Apo-1/CD95) membrane accounts for chemotherapy-associated apoptosis. In the present study, we analyzed the significance of FasL expression in the mediation of drug-induced apoptosis in the T-acute lymphatic leukemia model CEM. In particular, we examined the potential of the tumor drugs fludarabine, doxorubicin, and cisplatin to induce FasL expression. We also raised the question of whether apoptosis induced by these drugs occurs through the Fas pathway and hence can be blocked by the cowpox virus protein CrmA, a specific inhibitor of this pathway. All tumor drugs examined led to an increase in FasL protein. However, overexpression of CrmA had no effect on drug-induced apoptosis. Moreover, neither incubation with inhibitory monoclonal antibodies against Fas that completely prevented Fas-induced apoptosis in these cells nor pretreatment with a monoclonal antibody to FasL affected drug-induced cell death. Our observations suggest a Fas/FasL-independent mechanism for drug-induced apoptosis and exclude the involvement of caspase 1 and caspase 8 in this process in T-acute lymphatic leukemia cells.","['Villunger, A', 'Egle, A', 'Kos, M', 'Hartmann, B L', 'Geley, S', 'Kofler, R', 'Greil, R']","['Villunger A', 'Egle A', 'Kos M', 'Hartmann BL', 'Geley S', 'Kofler R', 'Greil R']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Innsbruck, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (FASLG protein, human)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Cisplatin/pharmacology', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Fas Ligand Protein', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/metabolism/*pathology', '*Ligands', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects/physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects', 'Vidarabine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'fas Receptor/*metabolism']",1997/08/15 00:00,1997/08/15 00:01,['1997/08/15 00:00'],"['1997/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1997/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1997 Aug 15;57(16):3331-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Concomitantly, the activity of topoisomerase (topo) II, as determined by monitoring activities specific to this enzyme such as DNA relaxation, DNA decatenation, and topo II-mediated DNA cleavage, was enhanced. The activity reached a maximum after 3 h and then decreased markedly after treatment with bufalin for 9 h. The amount of a complex of CK 2 and topo IIalpha in U937 cells was estimated by immunoprecipitation with antibodies raised against subunits of CK 2 and against topo IIalpha. The amount increased just after the start of treatment with bufalin and reached a maximum at 6 h. The results suggest that the topo IIalpha in the complex might have been phosphorylated by the translocated CK 2 and that the topo activity was stimulated by such phosphorylation. Apoptotic U937 cells with fragmented nuclei were observed between 9 and 12 h after the start of treatment using 10(-8) M bufalin. Therefore, it appears that the bufalin signal was transmitted to the nucleus by the translocation of CK 2, which formed a complex with topo IIalpha and modulated the activity of this enzyme, leading to the induction of apoptosis.","['Watabe, M', 'Nakajo, S', 'Yoshida, T', 'Kuroiwa, Y', 'Nakaya, K']","['Watabe M', 'Nakajo S', 'Yoshida T', 'Kuroiwa Y', 'Nakaya K']","['Laboratory of Biological Chemistry, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Showa University, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cell Growth Differ,Cell growth & differentiation : the molecular biology journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9100024,"['0 (Bufanolides)', '0 (DNA, Superhelical)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Casein Kinase II)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)', 'U549S98QLW (bufalin)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Biological Transport', 'Bufanolides/*pharmacology', 'Casein Kinase II', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/genetics/*metabolism', 'DNA, Superhelical/analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*enzymology/pathology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/08/01 00:00,1997/08/01 00:01,['1997/08/01 00:00'],"['1997/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cell Growth Differ. 1997 Aug;8(8):871-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Whereas it is well known that PBPC grafts and BM differ significantly in progenitor cell content and lymphocyte dose, the clinical consequences of these differences with respect to engraftment, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), and the graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect are more difficult to assess. We present a murine model that allows us to evaluate engraftment, GVHD, and GVL effect of allogeneic PBPC transplantation (PBPCT). Balb/c mice (H-2d) served as recipients. Donors were major histocompatibility complex-matched DBA/2 mice or syngeneic Balb/c mice, respectively. Experiments with increasing numbers of BMCs or Filgastrim-mobilized PBPCs showed that the number of progenitor cells in the graft was correlated with the probability to engraft, irrespective of the graft type. With identically high cell numbers transferred (1 x 10(9) nucleated cells/kg body weight [BW]), the mortality rates due to GVHD (25%) were about the same after allogeneic BM transplantation (BMT) and allogeneic PBPCT, although PBPC grafts contained four times more CD3+ T cells as compared with BM grafts (6.2 x 10(8) v 1.4 x 10(8)/kg BW). For investigation of GVL activity, Balb/c recipients were injected with syngeneic cells of the B-lymphocytic leukemia cell line A20 2 days before transplantation. After total body irradiation to a dose of 7.5 Gy, 1 x 10(9)/kg BW Balb/c PBPCs, DBA BMCs, or DBA PBPCs were infused. The relapse rates observed were 80% after syngeneic PBPCT (n = 22), 60% after allogeneic BMT (n = 23), and 34% after allogeneic PBPCT (n = 26) (allogeneic BMT v PBPCT, P = .032). We conclude that transplantation of allogeneic PBPCs instead of BM may enhance the GVL effect without an increase of GVHD.","['Glass, B', 'Uharek, L', 'Zeis, M', 'Dreger, P', 'Loffler, H', 'Steinmann, J', 'Schmitz, N']","['Glass B', 'Uharek L', 'Zeis M', 'Dreger P', 'Loffler H', 'Steinmann J', 'Schmitz N']","['2nd Department of Internal Medicine and Institute for Immunology, Christian-Albrechts-University of Kiel, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cell Separation', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Graft vs Host Reaction', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1997/08/15 00:00,1997/08/15 00:01,['1997/08/15 00:00'],"['1997/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1997/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)58088-9 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1997 Aug 15;90(4):1694-700.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We evaluated whether PML-RAR alpha mRNA type is associated with distinct pretreatment clinical characteristics and therapeutic outcome in previously untreated adult APL patients registered to protocol INT 0129 by the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group, the Southwest Oncology Group, and the Cancer and Leukemia Group B. Of 279 clinically eligible cases, 230 were molecularly evaluable, and of these, 111 were randomized to receive remission induction therapy with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and 119 with conventional chemotherapy. Nine cases not excluded by central pathology review were PML-RAR alpha negative, and notably, none of five of these cases treated with ATRA achieved complete remission (CR). Among 221 PML-RAR alpha-positive cases, there were 82 S-form cases (37%), 121 L-form cases (55%), and 18 V-form cases (8%). Before any antileukemic therapy, the S-form type, compared with the L-form type, was associated with higher values for the white blood cell (WBC) count (median 2,500/microL v 1,600/microL; P = .009), the percentage of blood blasts plus promyelocytes (median 29% v 8.5%; P = .03), and the absolute blood blasts plus promyelocytes (884/microL v 126/microL; P = .019). Also, an increased percentage of S-form versus L-form cases had the M3 variant phenotype, 24% v 12% (P = .036). There were no differences between S-form and L-form cases in either CR rate (79% v 69%; P = .14) or disease free survival distribution (multivariate analysis adjusting for the association of S-form type and higher WBC count; P = .40). We conclude that the S-form type is associated with previously-identified adverse risk WBC parameters but that the identification of the S-form or L-form type of PML-RAR alpha mRNA, per se, does not predict clinical outcome or add to the value of an increased WBC count as a negative prognostic indicator in APL patients.","['Gallagher, R E', 'Willman, C L', 'Slack, J L', 'Andersen, J W', 'Li, Y P', 'Viswanatha, D', 'Bloomfield, C D', 'Appelbaum, F R', 'Schiffer, C A', 'Tallman, M S', 'Wiernik, P H']","['Gallagher RE', 'Willman CL', 'Slack JL', 'Andersen JW', 'Li YP', 'Viswanatha D', 'Bloomfield CD', 'Appelbaum FR', 'Schiffer CA', 'Tallman MS', 'Wiernik PH']","['Department of Oncology, Montefiore Medical Center and Albert Einstein Cancer Center, Bronx, NY 10467, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Hemoglobins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 15', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Exons', 'Hemoglobins/analysis', 'Humans', 'Introns', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Platelet Count', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Messenger/*analysis', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tretinoin/therapeutic use']",1997/08/15 00:00,1997/08/15 00:01,['1997/08/15 00:00'],"['1997/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1997/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)58084-1 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1997 Aug 15;90(4):1656-63.,,,"['CA14958/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA21115/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA56771/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Identifying factors that predict for treatment outcome might allow therapy to be optimized based on risk. AML with t(8;21) has a distinctive immunophenotype, characterized by expression of the myeloid and stem cell antigens CD13, CD15, CD34, and HLADr, and frequent expression of the B-cell antigen CD19 and the neural cell adhesion molecule CD56, a natural killer cell/stem cell antigen. Because CD56 expression has been associated with both extramedullary leukemia and multidrug resistance, we sought to correlate CD56 expression with treatment outcome in AML with t(8;21). Pretreatment leukemia cells from 29 adult de novo AML patients with t(8;21) treated on Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) protocols were immunophenotyped by multiparameter flow cytometry as part of a prospective immunophenotyping study of adult AML (CALGB 8361). CD56 was expressed in 16 cases (55%). There was no correlation between CD56 expression and age, sex, white blood cell count, granulocyte count, the presence of additional cytogenetic abnormalities, or the presence of extramedullary disease at diagnosis. The CR rate to standard-dose cytarabine and daunorubicin was similar for cases with and without CD56 expression (88% v 92%; P = 1.0). Post-CR therapy included at least one course of high-dose cytarabine in 24 of 26 patients who achieved CR; numbers of courses administered were similar in cases with and without CD56 expression. Although post-CR therapy did not differ, CR duration was significantly shorter in cases with CD56 expression compared with those without (median, 8.7 months v not reached; P = .01), as was survival (median, 16.5 months v not reached; P = .008). We conclude that CD56 expression in AML with t(8;21) is associated with significantly shorter CR duration and survival.

Tumor cells are generally thought to be nonimmunogenic because they are of 'self' origin. However, tumor-reactive lymphocytes can be isolated from patients with many types of cancer. It is unclear what role these lymphocytes play and why they fail to protect the host. Using a murine B-cell leukemia/lymphoma (BCL1) model, we showed the development of a vigorous antitumor T-cell response in the tumor-susceptible host. Specific T-cell responses against BCL1 developed as early as day 4. However, the nature of this nonprotective response is different from the protective response produced in a major histocompatibility complex-matched tumor-resistant host. Susceptible hosts developed a T helper 2 (Th2)-dominant response, whereas resistant hosts developed a Th1-dominant response to BCL1. Cytolytic activity against BCL1 developed in both resistant and susceptible hosts, but in the susceptible host, this response was weaker and delayed compared with that in the resistant host. Thus, tumor susceptibility does not necessarily mean the absence of an antitumor immune response. Rather, the nature of the antitumor immune response is critical in determining clinical outcome.","['Lee, P P', 'Zeng, D', 'McCaulay, A E', 'Chen, Y F', 'Geiler, C', 'Umetsu, D T', 'Chao, N J']","['Lee PP', 'Zeng D', 'McCaulay AE', 'Chen YF', 'Geiler C', 'Umetsu DT', 'Chao NJ']","['Department of Medicine, Stanford University Medical Center, CA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,['0 (Cytokines)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Antibody Formation', 'Cell Division', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Cytokines/biosynthesis', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*immunology/mortality', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*immunology/mortality', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Phenotype', 'Th1 Cells/immunology', 'Th2 Cells/*immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/08/15 00:00,1997/08/15 00:01,['1997/08/15 00:00'],"['1997/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1997/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)58078-6 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1997 Aug 15;90(4):1611-7.,,,"['K07 AI01026/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'K08 CA72976-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI26322/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two classes of nuclear RA receptors, termed retinoic acid receptors (RARs) and retinoid X receptors, have been identified. Each receptor class consists of three subtypes. In the present study, we have used several synthetic retinoids to determine which receptor subtypes are involved in the regulation of TM and TF expression in NB4 APL cells, U937 monoblastic leukemia cells, and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Am80, which has no binding affinity for RAR gamma, and Ch55, which does not bind to cytoplasmic retinoic acid binding protein (CRABP), upregulated TM and downregulated TF in NB4 and U937 cells, similar to all-trans RA (ATRA). A specific RAR alpha antagonist, Ro41-5253, significantly suppressed the upregulation of TM by ATRA and Am80 in NB4 cells, U937 cells, and HUVECs. In contrast, only with preincubation with both RAR alpha and RAR beta antagonists was downregulation of TF by retinoids suppressed in NB4 cells. These findings indicate that the mechanism of transactivation and transrepression functions of RARs are distinct and also elucidate the major role of RAR alpha in TM upregulation by retinoids in leukemic cells and HUVECs and the cooperation of RAR alpha and RAR beta in TF downregulation by retinoids. They also indicate that binding to CRABP is not required for the anticoagulant effect of retinoids and that synthetic retinoids will prove very useful in controlling distinct targets, the TM and TF genes, at the level of transcription, and will permit the development of retinoids with a new type of anticoagulant effect.","['Shibakura, M', 'Koyama, T', 'Saito, T', 'Shudo, K', 'Miyasaka, N', 'Kamiyama, R', 'Hirosawa, S']","['Shibakura M', 'Koyama T', 'Saito T', 'Shudo K', 'Miyasaka N', 'Kamiyama R', 'Hirosawa S']","['School of Allied Health Sciences and the First Department of Internal Medicine, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Anticoagulants)', '0 (Benzoates)', '0 (Chromans)', '0 (Dibenzazepines)', '0 (LE 540)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoids)', '0 (Thrombomodulin)', '144092-31-9 (Ro 41-5253)', '9035-58-9 (Thromboplastin)']",IM,"['Anticoagulants/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Benzoates/pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Chromans/pharmacology', 'Dibenzazepines/pharmacology', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Endothelium, Vascular/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/*metabolism', 'Retinoids/antagonists & inhibitors/chemical synthesis/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Thrombomodulin/genetics/metabolism', 'Thromboplastin/metabolism', 'Umbilical Veins/cytology', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",1997/08/15 00:00,1997/08/15 00:01,['1997/08/15 00:00'],"['1997/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1997/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)58070-1 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1997 Aug 15;90(4):1545-51.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, hematopoietic-restricted genes, including the transcription factors GATA-1, EKLF, and PU.1 as well as globin genes and myeloperoxidase, were only expressed in wild-type and scl-heterozygous embryonic stem cells. Indirect immunofluorescence was used to confirm the observations that GATA-1 and globins were only present in control embryoid bodies but that CD34 was found on both control and scl-null embryoid bodies.

All patients were conditioned with cyclophosphamide and total body irradiation followed by marrow transplants from closely HLA-matched, unrelated volunteers.

Although genetic alterations in these genes may be limited to lymphoid malignancies, it has been reported that their inactivation by aberrant methylation of 5' CpG islands may be involved in various hematologic malignancies. In this study, we investigated the p15INK4B and p16INK4A genes to clarify their roles in the pathogenesis of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Southern blotting analysis showed no gross genetic alterations in either of these genes. However, hypermethylation of the 5' CpG island of the p15INK4B gene occurred frequently in patients with MDS (16/32 [50%]). Interestingly, the p15INK4B gene was frequently methylated in patients with high-risk MDS (refractory anemia with excess blasts [RAEB], RAEB in transformation [RAEB-t], and overt leukemia evolved from MDS; 14/18 [78%]) compared with patients with low-risk MDS (refractory anemia [RA] and refractory anemia with ring sideroblast [RARS]; 1/12 [8%]). Furthermore, methylation status of the p15INK4B gene was progressed with the development of MDS in most patients examined. In contrast, none of the MDS patients showed apparent hypermethylation of the p16INK4A gene.

Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with probes from the BCR and ABL regions can also identify the Ph translocation in interphase cells. Established systems for the detection of fusion genes by FISH rely on colocalization of two different probes but are associated with a high rate of false-positive results. We have introduced a third probe labeled with a different fluorochrome to create a triple-probe/three-color system that permits identification of both the Ph chromosome and the derivative 9 chromosome in Ph+ cells. This system was used to determine the frequency of interphase cells carrying the BCR-ABL fusion gene in bone marrow and peripheral blood granulocytes from patients showing variable cytogenetic responses to interferon.

Here it is established that chromosomal aberrations detected in bone marrow cells by chromosome painting are induced in all mice at an approximately 2-fold greater frequency in chr 2 by comparison with chrs 1 and 3 at 24 and 48 h following in vivo whole-body X-irradiation. Long-term follow up studies (to 15 months post-irradiation) indicated that chromosomal hypersensitivity is accounted for largely by the existence of hot-spots for aberration formation on sensitive chromosomes. Analysis of clonal developments suggested that chr 2 aberrant clones are selected for entry into the proliferating bone marrow cell compartment in preference to cells with other aberrations and that these clones in general have a higher proliferative potential. However, neither the induction of chr 2 aberrations nor the presence of a chr 2 aberrant clone specifically predict the development of AML in an individual irradiated mouse.

The PC4 cell lines selected in higher drug concentrations (80-1280 ng/ml) demonstrated amplification of all three mdr genes with preferential amplification of mdr3. Overexpression of the mdr2 and mdr3 genes accompanied their genomic amplification; however, expression of mdr1 was not seen despite amplification. In the C7D cell lines selected with higher drug concentrations (40-160 ng/ ml), amplification and overexpression of mdr1 and mdr2 without mdr3 was observed. Increased expression of mdr1 occurred prior to gene amplification. The distribution of mdr-specific genes in micrococcal nuclease-generated chromatin fractions differing in transcriptionally active sequences and proteins was different between the parent and drug-resistant sublines. An enrichment (two- to threefold) of mdr3 genes in the H1-depleted mononucleosome fraction enriched for actively transcribed genes (e.g., globin) was detected by Southern analysis of chromatin fractions in PC4-80 cells (selected in 80 ng/ml of adriamycin and overexpressing mdr3), compared to the parental cells. mdr3 enrichment was also detected using a new PCR-based method, which examined mdr3 genes and repetitive sequences. Of note, the H1-depleted chromatin fraction from PC4-20 showed enrichment of the mdr3 gene, although mdr3 expression was not detected in the cell line. These studies showed a different pattern of gene amplification and overexpression in genetically related erythroleukemia cell lines selected for resistance to the same chemotherapeutic agent. A change in chromatin organization of mdr genes preceded overexpression and amplification of the mdr3 gene.","['Fracasso, P M', 'Slapak, C A', 'Nair, S', 'Modrak, D', 'Draper, M P', 'LeCerf, J M', 'Levy, S B']","['Fracasso PM', 'Slapak CA', 'Nair S', 'Modrak D', 'Draper MP', 'LeCerf JM', 'Levy SB']","['Department of Medicine, New England Medical Center, Boston, MA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Oncol Res,Oncology research,9208097,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Chromatin)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*genetics', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatin/ultrastructure', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', '*Gene Amplification', '*Genes, MDR', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/pathology', 'Mice']",1997/01/01 00:00,1997/01/01 00:01,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncol Res. 1997;9(4):183-91.,,,"['1F32-CA08553/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5F32-CA08774/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA59341/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The pattern of p53 mutations in CML shows some peculiarities compared with majority of other malignancies. In particular, the substitutions at codon 273, one of the most common p53 alterations in various tumors, are not characteristic of CML. To test whether the distinctions in the pattern of p53 mutations are connected with some peculiarities of the biological effects of different mutant proteins in leukemic cells, we obtained and analyzed a panel of human K562 cell sublines expressing various exogenous p53; human Pro156, His175, His194, Trp248, and His273, or murine temperature-sensitive (ts) Val135 that has properties of mutant protein at 37 degrees C, but shows activities of the wild-type (wt) p53 at 32 degrees C. We have found that expression of wt-p53 enhanced the dependence of cells on growth/survival factors. Incubation of sparse (< 10(5) cells per/ml) K562/Val135 cultures at 32 degrees C caused apoptosis. In media conditioned by cells of different origin (K562, colorectal carcinoma LIM1215, Rat1 fibroblasts) the p53-dependent apoptosis was inhibited. Under such conditions the expression of ts-wt-p53 was accompanied by dramatic increase in the number of cells producing specific markers of erythroid differentiation-GlycPhA and Ag-Eb. Unlike to the wt-p53, the majority of tumor-derived mutant p53 (Pro156, His175, His194) increased cell survival in low serum and decreased the number of cells expressing Glyc-PhA, CD9, CD15, and CD71 differentiation antigens. On the other hand, expression of His273-p53 caused significant augmentation in the number of CD9-positive cells and enhanced the dependence on growth/survival factors that are present in serum or conditioned media. The data obtained allow to suggest that an unusual pattern of p53 mutations in CML reflects some peculiarities of biological effects of certain mutant proteins on differentiation and viability of leukemic cells.","['Kremenetskaya, O S', 'Logacheva, N P', 'Baryshnikov, A Y', 'Chumakov, P M', 'Kopnin, B P']","['Kremenetskaya OS', 'Logacheva NP', 'Baryshnikov AY', 'Chumakov PM', 'Kopnin BP']","['Department of Cytogenetics, Cancer Research Centre, Moscow, Russia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Oncol Res,Oncology research,9208097,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Survival', 'Culture Media', '*Genes, p53', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Phenotype', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*genetics']",1997/01/01 00:00,1997/01/01 00:01,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncol Res. 1997;9(4):155-66.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In later life, a subset of these mice develop clonal CD5+ B cell tumors analogous to human chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). NZB disease is marked by B cell hyperactivity characterized by spontaneous immunoglobulin secretion and proliferation. Elimination of autoreactive lymphocytes by apoptosis is a vital mechanism to prevent expansion of self-reactive lymphocyte population. TGF-beta appears to be an important factor in normal and abnormal immune regulation and this cytokine may play a role in the development of chronic human B cell tumors. We asked whether the response to or production of TGF-beta by NZB B cells was aberrant and could contribute to disease development. In this study, we demonstrated that the apoptotic response to TGF-beta was increased in B cells from NZB mice compared to B cells from normal BALB/c mice. The increased apoptosis was related to endogenous activation and was possibly mediated through increased expression of the TGF-beta Type II receptor. Despite functional differences between CD5-negative B cells and CD5-positive B cells, TGF-beta induced apoptosis in both populations to a similar extent. NZB B cells also secrete increased active TGF-beta compared to BALB/c B cells. We suggest that the aberrant secretion of active TGF-beta and the increased response to the apoptotic effects of TGF-beta by NZB B cells may play a role in the disease process of these mice, perhaps attempting to limit the autoimmune phenomena, but possibly also contributing to generalized immunosuppression. We also suggest that the CD5(+) tumors in the NZB mouse may not be a fully appropriate model of human CLL, since CLL B cells are abnormally resistant to the apoptotic effects of TGF-beta.","['Douglas, R S', 'Woo, E Y', 'Capocasale, R J', 'Tarshis, A D', 'Nowell, P C', 'Moore, J S']","['Douglas RS', 'Woo EY', 'Capocasale RJ', 'Tarshis AD', 'Nowell PC', 'Moore JS']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia 19104-6082, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Cell Immunol,Cellular immunology,1246405,"['0 (CD5 Antigens)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Receptors, Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.30 (Receptor, Transforming Growth Factor-beta Type II)']",IM,"['Age Factors', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/immunology', 'Autoimmune Diseases/*immunology', 'B-Lymphocyte Subsets/immunology/*metabolism', 'CD5 Antigens/biosynthesis/physiology', 'Female', 'Lipopolysaccharides/pharmacology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred NZB', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Receptor, Transforming Growth Factor-beta Type II', 'Receptors, Transforming Growth Factor beta/biosynthesis', 'Species Specificity', 'Spleen/cytology/immunology', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/*biosynthesis/metabolism/*physiology']",1997/08/01 00:00,1997/08/01 00:01,['1997/08/01 00:00'],"['1997/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0008-8749(97)91149-7 [pii]', '10.1006/cimm.1997.1149 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Immunol. 1997 Aug 1;179(2):126-37. doi: 10.1006/cimm.1997.1149.,,,['CA42232/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our results demonstrated 4- to 20-fold increases in the surface expression and mRNA levels of both of these receptor components at RA concentrations starting at 10(-10) M with maximal induction at 1 microM RA. RA-induced upregulation of IL-2Rbeta was found to be transcriptionally mediated in a protein-synthesis-independent fashion; however, activation of the IL-2Rbeta promoter could not be demonstrated in transient transfection experiments utilizing reporter gene constructs containing all currently known regulatory elements of the IL-2Rbeta promoter. Enhancement of IL-2Ralpha/beta by RA was accompanied by upregulation of the expression of CD38, CD69, CD45RO, and HLA-DR, surface molecules known to be associated with T-cell activation. Parallel effects were induced by RA on T-blasts generated from primary human lymphocytes suggesting the physiologic relevance of the Hut78 cell line model. Taken together, our findings demonstrate the ability of RA to upregulate IL-2R expression and enhance the activation state of Hut78 cells.

Recently, the human ELL gene was shown to encode an RNA polymerase II elongation factor that activates elongation by suppressing transient pausing by polymerase at many sites along the DNA. In this report, we identify and characterize two overlapping ELL functional domains that govern its interaction with RNA polymerase II and the ternary elongation complex. Our findings reveal that, in addition to its elongation activation domain, ELL contains a novel type of RNA polymerase II interaction domain that is capable of negatively regulating polymerase activity in promoter-specific transcription initiation in vitro. Notably, the MLL-ELL translocation results in deletion of a portion of this functional domain, and ELL mutants lacking sequences deleted by the translocation bind RNA polymerase II and are fully active in elongation, but fail to inhibit initiation. Taken together, these results raise the possibility that the MLL-ELL translocation could alter ELL-RNA polymerase II interactions that are not involved in regulation of elongation.","['Shilatifard, A', 'Haque, D', 'Conaway, R C', 'Conaway, J W']","['Shilatifard A', 'Haque D', 'Conaway RC', 'Conaway JW']","['Program in Molecular and Cell Biology, Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma 73104, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (ELL protein, human)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Peptide Elongation Factors)', '0 (Transcription Factor TFIIB)', '0 (Transcription Factor TFIID)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Transcription Factors, TFII)', '0 (Transcriptional Elongation Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (RNA Polymerase II)']",IM,"['*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 19', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', '*Peptide Chain Elongation, Translational', '*Peptide Elongation Factors', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'RNA Polymerase II/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factor TFIIB', 'Transcription Factor TFIID', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors, TFII/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transcriptional Elongation Factors', 'Zinc Fingers']",1997/08/29 00:00,1997/08/29 00:01,['1997/08/29 00:00'],"['1997/08/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/08/29 00:01 [medline]', '1997/08/29 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.272.35.22355 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)65702-9 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1997 Aug 29;272(35):22355-63. doi: 10.1074/jbc.272.35.22355.,,,['GM41628/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Separation of reverse transcriptase (RT) into polymerase and RNase H domains yields an active RNase H from murine leukemia virus (MuLV) but an inactive human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) RNase H. The ""handle region"" present in E. coli RNase HI but absent in HIV RNase H contributes to the binding to its substrate and when inserted into HIV RNase H results in an active enzyme retaining some degree of specificity. Here, we show MuLV protein containing the C-terminal 175 amino acids with its own handle region or that of E. coli RNase HI has the same specific activity as the RNase H of RT, retains a preference for Mn2+ as the cation required for activity, and has association rate (KA) 10% that of E. coli RNase HI. However, with model substrates, specificities for removal of the tRNAPro primer and polypurine tract stability are lost, indicating specificity of RNase H of MuLV requires the remainder of the RT. Differences in KA, while significant, appear insufficient to account for the differences in specific activities of the bacterial and viral RNases H.","['Zhan, X', 'Crouch, R J']","['Zhan X', 'Crouch RJ']","['Laboratory of Molecular Genetics, NICHD, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '42Z2K6ZL8P (Manganese)', '9014-25-9 (RNA, Transfer)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)', 'EC 3.1.26.4 (Ribonuclease H)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Catalysis', 'Escherichia coli', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*enzymology', 'Manganese/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'RNA, Transfer/metabolism', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Ribonuclease H/chemistry/*isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Substrate Specificity']",1997/08/29 00:00,1997/08/29 00:01,['1997/08/29 00:00'],"['1997/08/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/08/29 00:01 [medline]', '1997/08/29 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.272.35.22023 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)65656-5 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1997 Aug 29;272(35):22023-9. doi: 10.1074/jbc.272.35.22023.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is also an environmental pollutant. There is concern about exposure to 1,3-butadiene as it has been shown to produce tumours in rats, mice and an increased risk of leukaemia in humans. It has also been shown to produce germ cell effects in mice. Differences in responses to 1,3-butadiene have been reported in rats and mice, possibly due to different metabolic capabilities. The present study thus investigated somatic and germ cell effects of 1,3-butadiene in mice and its metabolites in both rats and mice to help determine species differences using different endpoints for genotoxic effects. These included DNA strand breakage as measured in the single cell gel electrophoresis (Comet assay) in bone marrow and testicular cells, and micronuclei in bone marrow cells using both the acridine orange and Giemsa staining methods. Unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) was also measured in the testes of mice. CD-1 mice were exposed to 1,3-butadiene by inhalation for 6 h/day for 4 weeks, and CD-1 mice and Sprague-Dawley rats to the metabolites after i.p. injection. 1,3-Butadiene did not affect liver, bone marrow and testicular cells in mice as measured in the Comet assay. After treatment with 1,2-epoxybutene in the Comet assay, there was a response in the testes in mice but not in rats and there was little or no effect in the bone marrow assay in mice but there was in rats. After treatment with 1,2,3,4-diepoxybutane in the Comet assay in mice, there was a response in the bone marrow cells but not in the testicular cells, and in rats there was also a response only in bone marrow cells. There was an increase in micronuclei in both rats and mice with both metabolites, but clastogenicity was stronger with 1,2,3,4-diepoxybutane, occurring at lower doses, than with 1,2-epoxybutene. In the UDS assay in the testes of mice, there was an increase in response with 1,2,3,4-diepoxybutane treatment but not with 1,2-epoxybutene. These studies would appear to confirm a species difference of CD-1 mice and Sprague-Dawley rats, where mice were sensitive at lower doses than rats.","['Anderson, D', 'Dobrzynka, M M', 'Jackson, L I', 'Yu, T W', 'Brinkworth, M H']","['Anderson D', 'Dobrzynka MM', 'Jackson LI', 'Yu TW', 'Brinkworth MH']","['BIBRA International, Carshalton, Surrey, UK. plawrence@bibra.co.uk']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Mutat Res,Mutation research,0400763,"['0 (Butadienes)', '0 (Epoxy Compounds)', '0 (Mutagens)', '478ERR5NKR (3,4-epoxy-1-butene)', '60OB65YNAB (diepoxybutane)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'JSD5FGP5VD (1,3-butadiene)']",IM,"['Administration, Inhalation', 'Animals', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects', 'Butadienes/administration & dosage/metabolism/*toxicity', 'DNA/biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Electrophoresis/methods', 'Epoxy Compounds/administration & dosage/*toxicity', 'Liver/drug effects', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Micronucleus Tests', 'Mutagenicity Tests/methods', 'Mutagens/toxicity', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Species Specificity', 'Spermatozoa/*drug effects', 'Testis/drug effects']",1997/07/14 00:00,1997/07/14 00:01,['1997/07/14 00:00'],"['1997/07/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/07/14 00:01 [medline]', '1997/07/14 00:00 [entrez]']","['S1383-5718(97)00069-7 [pii]', '10.1016/s1383-5718(97)00069-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Mutat Res. 1997 Jul 14;391(3):233-42. doi: 10.1016/s1383-5718(97)00069-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To assess the usefulness of antibodies to cyclin D-1 (BCL-1/ PRAD-1), CD99 (12E7), CD34, and TdT in distinguishing between MCL-BV and LBL in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue, we studied from the Stanford data base 10 cases originally diagnosed as B-lineage LBL, 5 MCL-BVs, 2 cases thought likely to represent MCL-BV, and 2 blastic lymphomas whose morphology and immunophenotype were indeterminate. Six (60%) of 10 LBLs stained with CD99, as opposed to none of 7 MCL-BVs. Four (40%) of 10 LBLs reacted with CD34, as compared with none of 7 MCL-BVs. Eight (89%) of nine LBLs were positive for TdT, but all of the four MCL-BVs tested were negative. In contrast, the anti-cyclin D-1 antibody stained the nuclei of all of the MCL-BVs and none of the LBLs tested.

These complications reflect histo-incompatibility between donor and recipient. Molecular technology has recently been applied to HLA typing to identify alleles not distinguishable with serologic typing techniques. We report results in 92 unrelated marrow transplant recipients who were HLA seroidentical with donor HLA-A, -B, and -DR antigens and assess the effect of DR beta 1 and DQ beta compatibility using sequence specific oligonucleotide primers. Forty-eight patients received T-cell depleted marrow grafts, and 44 received unmodified grafts. Among recipients of unmodified marrow grafts, matching for both DR beta 1 and DQ beta reduced the rate of grade 3-4 acute graft-vs.-host disease to 38 +/- 20% vs. 73 +/- 20% among recipients mismatched for either allele (p = 0.02). This difference was not observed in recipients of T-cell depleted marrow grafts. Multivariate analysis confirmed matching for both DR beta 1 and DQ beta loci (p = 0.015), and receiving a T-cell depleted graft (p = 0.008) independently predicted for reduced risk of grade 3-4 acute graft-vs.-host disease. In conclusion, both DR beta 1 and DQ beta appear biologically important for development of acute graft-vs.-host disease in patients receiving unmanipulated marrow grafts for unrelated donor transplant.","['Gajewski, J', 'Gjertson, D', 'Cecka, M', 'Tonai, R', 'Przepiorka, D', 'Hunt, L', 'Giralt, S', 'Chan, K W', 'Feig, S', 'Territo, M', 'Andersson, B', 'van Besien, K', 'Khouri, I', 'Fischer, H', 'Babbitt, L', 'Ippolitti, C', 'Schiller, G', 'Lill, M', 'Warkentin, D', 'Neumann, J', 'Petz, L', 'Terasaki, P', 'Champlin, R']","['Gajewski J', 'Gjertson D', 'Cecka M', 'Tonai R', 'Przepiorka D', 'Hunt L', 'Giralt S', 'Chan KW', 'Feig S', 'Territo M', 'Andersson B', 'van Besien K', 'Khouri I', 'Fischer H', 'Babbitt L', 'Ippolitti C', 'Schiller G', 'Lill M', 'Warkentin D', 'Neumann J', 'Petz L', 'Terasaki P', 'Champlin R']","['University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Department of Hematology, Houston 77030, USA. jgajewski@utmdacc.mda.uth.onc.edu']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Controlled Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,"['0 (HLA-DQ Antigens)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Alleles', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*immunology', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/epidemiology/genetics/immunology', 'HLA-DQ Antigens/*genetics', 'HLA-DR Antigens/*genetics', 'Histocompatibility Testing/*methods', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia/immunology/therapy', 'Lymphocyte Count', '*Lymphocyte Depletion', 'Male', 'Regression Analysis', 'Serology', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/*immunology', 'Tissue Donors']",1997/06/01 00:00,1997/06/01 00:01,['1997/06/01 00:00'],"['1997/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 1997 Jun;3(2):76-82.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To clarify the effects of dbcAMP, the effects of butyrate and cAMP-increasing reagents, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and forskolin, on EoL-1 cellular differentiation and apoptosis were examined and compared. PGE2 and forskolin but not butyrate induced differentiation to eosinophilic granule-containing cells, suggesting that cAMP played a primary role in eosinophilic differentiation of EoL-1 cells. PGE2, forskolin and butyrate, when used alone, did not induce apoptosis of EoL-1 cells significantly at the concentrations used, but sequential stimulation of EoL-1 cells with the cAMP-increasing reagents and butyrate showed that butyrate induced further maturation and apoptosis of cAMP-induced eosinophilic granule-containing cells. These results showed that cAMP and butyrate have different effects on eosinophilic differentiation and apoptosis of EoL-1 cells. The cAMP-increasing reagents and butyrate also showed different effects on expression of members of the bcl-2 family; PGE2 decreased bcl-2 and bax levels, whereas butyrate increased the bcl-2 level. PGE2 or PGE2+butyrate, but not butyrate alone, induced bcl-XS expression. EoL-1 cells constitutively expressed Fas and anti-Fas antibody induced EoL-1 cell death, but the Fas/Fas ligand system was not involved in dbcAMP-induced EoL-1 cell apoptosis. The EoL-1 cell line is thus a useful model in which to examine differentiation and apoptosis of eosinophilic leukemia cells.","['Tai, G', 'Eun-Young, J', 'Yuji, H', 'Masahiko, K', 'Toshio, H', 'Kenji, K', 'Kenshi, F', 'Mitsufumi, M']","['Tai G', 'Eun-Young J', 'Yuji H', 'Masahiko K', 'Toshio H', 'Kenji K', 'Kenshi F', 'Mitsufumi M']","['Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Kyoto University, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Hematol Oncol,Hematological oncology,8307268,"['0 (Butyrates)', '0 (Drug Combinations)', '0 (Histamine Antagonists)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '107-92-6 (Butyric Acid)', '1F7A44V6OU (Colforsin)', '63X7MBT2LQ (Bucladesine)', 'K7Q1JQR04M (Dinoprostone)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Bucladesine/*pharmacology', 'Butyrates/*pharmacology', 'Butyric Acid', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Colforsin/pharmacology', 'Dinoprostone/pharmacology', 'Drug Combinations', 'Eosinophils/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Histamine Antagonists/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Hypereosinophilic Syndrome/*drug therapy/immunology/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*biosynthesis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/immunology/metabolism', 'fas Receptor/immunology']",1996/12/01 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1996/12/01 00:00'],"['1996/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1996/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1099-1069(199612)14:4<181::AID-HON589>3.0.CO;2-Y [pii]', '10.1002/(SICI)1099-1069(199612)14:4<181::AID-HON589>3.0.CO;2-Y [doi]']",ppublish,Hematol Oncol. 1996 Dec;14(4):181-92. doi: 10.1002/(SICI)1099-1069(199612)14:4<181::AID-HON589>3.0.CO;2-Y.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was grade I, and chronic GVHD was not present. The patient exhibited complications of upper and lower respiratory infections several times after BMT, all of which subsided within a month. Chemotactic responses toward all three chemotactic factors, random mobility, phagocytosis, superoxide (O2-) release and bactericidal activity were severely impaired early after reconstitution.

Both O2- release and bactericidal activity of neutrophils were significantly enhanced at 6 and 12 months after marrow reconstitution following pretreatment of 50 ng/ml of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) in vitro.

To this end, we have constructed an asRNA gene expressed from the bovine leukaemia virus (BLV) U3 promoter that is complementary to the R-U5 region of the BLV genome. This is the region that is most susceptible to inhibition by asRNA. With plasmid pLU, which expresses the asRNA gene under the control of the BLV U3 promoter, 75% inhibition of virus replication was attained in CC81 cells (the molar ratio of pLU DNA over BLV proviral DNA in the transfection mixture was 5:1). Plasmid pLT, which contains only the BLV U3 promoter without any asRNA-coding region, also efficiently (up to 60%) inhibited virus replication when cotransfected with BLV proviral DNA at a ratio of 20:1. It was suggested that competition between functional and 'empty' viral promoters for the viral transactivator protein p38tax could account for this inhibition. An immunoblotting assay showed that in the presence of nuclear extracts from CC81 cells exogenous BLV p38tax specifically associates with its responsive sequence located in the BLV U3 promoter.

In IPC-81 leukaemia cells, activation of the cAMP pathway by prostaglandin E1 treatment, or other cAMP-elevating agents, induces apoptosis within 4-6 h. Inhibition of mRNA or protein synthesis during the first 2 h of cAMP induction protects cells from apoptosis, suggesting a requirement for early gene expression. cAMP-dependent protein kinase phosphorylates a class of nuclear factors and thereby regulates the transcription of a specific set of genes. Here we show that CREM (cAMP Responsive Element Modulator) expression is induced rapidly upon prostaglandin E1 treatment of IPC-81 cells. The induced transcripts correspond to the early product ICER (Inducible cAMP Early Repressor). ICER expression remains elevated until the burst of cell death. Protein synthesis inhibitors which prevent cAMP-induced apoptosis also block de novo ICER synthesis. Transfected IPC-81 cell lines, constitutively expressing high level of ICER are resistant to cAMP-induced cell death. In these transfected cells, cAMP fails to upregulate the ICER transcripts demonstrating that ICER exerts strongly its repressor function on CRE-containing genes. That an early expression of ICER blocks apoptosis, suggests that gene repression by endogenous ICER in IPC-81 is insufficient or occurs too late to protect cells against death. ICER transfected cells rescued from cAMP-induced apoptosis are growth arrested. It shows for the first time that CREM activation directly participates to the decision of the cell to die. ICER, by sequentially repressing distinct sets of CRE-containing genes could modulate cell fate.","['Ruchaud, S', 'Seite, P', 'Foulkes, N S', 'Sassone-Corsi, P', 'Lanotte, M']","['Ruchaud S', 'Seite P', 'Foulkes NS', 'Sassone-Corsi P', 'Lanotte M']","['INSERM U301, Centre G.

The selection of normal (Ph-negative) progenitor cells from CML patients would potentially be of considerable clinical value for ex vivo purging and autologous transplantation. To obtain these cells. CD34-positive (progenitor) cells from the peripheral blood (PB) of CML patients were pretreated with 5-fluorouracil (5FU) (5 microg/ml) to suppress Ph-positive cells and then grown in suspension culture for 7 d with a combination of cytokines. We compared two combinations of cytokines: interleukin-1alpha (IL1alpha) and interleukin-3 (IL3) with either Flt3-ligand (FLT3L) or stem cell factor (SCF). Using these two combinations, we obtained the same degree of day 14 CFU-GM expansion (3.1 +/- 0.5 and 3.4 +/- 0.7 fold expansion). FISH analysis showed that 5FU pretreatment significantly favoured a higher frequency of Ph-negative cells after expansion in liquid culture. Moreover, after 5FU pretreatment, the mean (+/-SEM) percentage of Ph negativity was significantly greater for IL1alpha-IL3-FLT3L compared to IL1alpha-IL3-SCF (19.1 +/- 2.5% v 14.8 +/- 2.3%, P=0.009, n = 7). The output long-term culture initiating cells (LTC-IC) which could only be detected after 5FU pretreatment and the combination, IL1alpha-IL3-FLT3L were all Ph negative by FISH analysis. Thus, a subset of Ph-negative cells was selected from CML PB by 5FU and expanded using the combination of cytokines IL1alpha-IL3-FLT3L and IL1alpha-IL3-SCF.

Early relapse can be detected using highly sensitive assays such as the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) which have been shown to have predictive value for subsequent relapse in selected patient populations. The validity of PCR for predicting CML relapse in unrelated marrow transplant recipients where the GVL effect appears to be augmented due to increased HLA disparity between donor and recipient, however, has not been well defined. In this study we assessed the prognostic value of PCR in a cohort of 52 patients transplanted with T-cell-depleted unrelated marrow grafts for CML. The actual probability of relapse at 3 years was 71% in patients with at least one positive assay versus 6% in patients with no positive assays post-transplant. Patients with one or more positive assays at any time post-transplant had a 56-fold increased risk of relapse which was significantly higher (P=0.0002) than that observed in patients who remained persistently PCR negative. Moreover, PCR detected relapse a median of 5 months earlier than cytogenetic analysis in a subgroup of patients in whom concurrent sampling had been performed. These data validate the use of PCR as a prognostic test in this patient population and may help to identify a cohort of patients to be considered as candidates for pre-emptive adoptive immunotherapy.","['Drobyski, W R', 'Endean, D J', 'Klein, J P', 'Hessner, M J']","['Drobyski WR', 'Endean DJ', 'Klein JP', 'Hessner MJ']","['Department of Medicine, Medical College of Wisconsin and The Blood Center of Southeastern Wisconsin, Milwaukee, U.S.A.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diagnosis/*genetics/therapy', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Male', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*diagnosis', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Recurrence', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1997/08/01 00:00,1997/08/01 00:01,['1997/08/01 00:00'],"['1997/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-2141.1997.2223039.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1997 Aug;98(2):458-66. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1997.2223039.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As the patient had previously received cytotoxic chemotherapy for Hodgkin's disease, the MDS and AML were probably related to such therapy. Sequential karyotypic analysis established a del(5q) as the initial cytogenetic abnormality. Additional alterations, including t(10;13)(q24;q14), had developed subsequently during disease progression. Southern blot analysis of OHN-GM cells suggested deletion of one allele of the IRF-1 gene, although no aberrant transcripts were detected. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis revealed the deletion of the Rb gene due to the t(10;13)(q24;q14) translocation, and Western blot analysis demonstrated the absence of Rb protein in OHN-GM cells. Finally, the OHN-GM cells exhibited two missense point mutations in highly conserved regions of the p53 gene. These observations suggest that a multistep process, involving alterations of Rb and p53 genes, may have contributed to the patient's disease development and progression. To our knowledge, OHN-GM is the first cell line derived from a therapy-related AML.

These disorders have some features in common, and a percentage of cases progress to acute leukaemia. We speculated that changes in gene stability are involved in the pathogenesis of these haemopoietic stem cell disorders. Therefore we investigated in vivo mutation frequencies in these disorders by erythrocyte glycophorin A (GPA) mutation assay. The assay enumerates NO or NN variant cells in 106 erythrocytes of the MN type using a flowcytometric technique. Patients undergoing chemotherapy known to be at risk of hypermutageneity were also studied. Events exceeding the 95th percentile of healthy donors (> or = 32 and 34 events, respectively for NO and NN variants) were defined as abnormal. Abnormal events in the NO variants were found in three out of seven patients undergoing chemotherapy, two out of nine patients with AA, two out of seven patients with MDS, and four out of nine patients with PNH. Abnormal events in the NN variants were found in three out of seven patients undergoing chemotherapy, two out of nine patients with AA, one out of seven patients with MDS, and two out of nine patients with PNH.

Sequential studies in four cases did not show changes in the amount of MRD. At a median follow-up of 72 months (range 15-108), 5/23 (22%) patients have relapsed with a median time of 59 months (range 15-105). MRD was detected in three of the five patients who relapsed.

MRD was also documented in 7/18 patients who continued in clinical CR for a median of 80 months (range 63-98). There were no statistical differences in disease-free survival between MRD+ and MRD- patients (P = 0.8). Our findings indicate that relapse after long-term remission achieved with DCF cannot be predicted when MRD is detected by sensitive methods.

Results were compared with NG from 15 healthy bone marrow donors (control group A) and from six patients receiving intensive chemotherapy before autologous BMT (control group B). A significant increase in CD15 and a decrease in 8C7 antigen expression was observed in peripheral blood NG from BMT patients compared with controls A. MPO-7 in NG after BMT did not differ from control group A. Autologous BMT patients showed a lower percentage of NG expressing 13F6, 31D8 and CD16 (Leu 11a) than allogeneic BMT patients, and a significant decrease in 8C7 antigen expression compared with patients receiving intensive chemotherapy. Ultrastructurally, a marked decrease of azurophilic granules was observed in NG from BMT patients compared with control groups A and B. These data indicate that repopulation after BMT was made by phenotypically less mature NG with dysgranulopoietic features. Differences between autologous and allogeneic BMT patients may be partly related to GM-CSF usage.

In spite of their prominence, it is not a priori evident why these models work. This article presents a derivation of the two models from the framework of canonical modeling. It begins with a general description of the dynamics between risk sources and disease development, formulates this description in the canonical representation of an S-system, and shows how the linear-logistic model and Cox's proportional hazard model follow naturally from this representation. The article interprets the model parameters in terms of epidemiological concepts as well as in terms of general systems theory and explains the assumptions and limitations generally accepted in the application of these epidemiological models.","['Voit, E O', 'Knapp, R G']","['Voit EO', 'Knapp RG']","['Department of Biometry and Epidemiology, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston 29425-2503, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Stat Med,Statistics in medicine,8215016,,IM,"['Communicable Diseases/epidemiology', 'Disease Outbreaks/statistics & numerical data', '*Epidemiologic Methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/epidemiology', 'Linear Models', '*Logistic Models', 'Odds Ratio', '*Proportional Hazards Models', 'Risk Factors']",1997/08/15 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1997/08/15 00:00'],"['1997/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1997/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0258(19970815)16:15<1705::AID-SIM599>3.0.CO;2-7 [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1097-0258(19970815)16:15<1705::aid-sim599>3.0.co;2-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Stat Med. 1997 Aug 15;16(15):1705-29. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1097-0258(19970815)16:15<1705::aid-sim599>3.0.co;2-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This PEBP2beta/CBFbeta was free from its DNA-binding partner, the alpha subunit of PEBP2/CBF, as judged by the electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Furthermore, a significant amount of PEBP2beta/CBFbeta was retained in the cytoskeleton preparation after detergent extraction of the cells and was found by double immunofluorescence to colocalize with the F-actin on stress fibers and the vinculin in membrane processes.

To study the mechanism of apoptosis, we developed a novel apoptosis-resistant variant, UC, from U937 cells. The UC cells showed resistance to apoptosis induced by TNF-alpha, anti-Fas antibody, etoposide and Ara-C. Somatic cell hybridization between U937 and UC showed that apoptosis-resistance to TNF-alpha in UC was genetically recessive and resistance to etoposide was dominant, suggesting that UC has at least two different mutations functionally involved in apoptosis. Mechanistic analysis revealed that UC cells expressed reduced amounts of c-Myc. Transfection of the c-myc gene into UC cells restored the sensitivity of the cells to undergo apoptosis induced by TNF-alpha and anti-Fas, which attributes apoptosis-resistance in this circumstance to the reduced expression of c-Myc. On the other hand, c-myc transfection into UC cells could not restore their sensitivity to etoposide- and Ara-C-induced apoptosis, arguing against the role of c-myc in chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. However, treating the parental U937 cells with antisense oligonucleotides designed to reduce c-Myc expression rendered the cells resistant to etoposide-induced as well as to TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis. These results indicate that the reduced expression of c-Myc in UC is strongly associated with the resistance to etoposide-induced apoptosis. Our finding that c-myc transfection into UC could not restore the sensitivity to etoposide-induced apoptosis, suggests UC could have a second mutation that confers resistance to etoposide-induced apoptosis in a genetically dominant manner. Taken together, our present results indicate that c-Myc plays a role in cellular susceptibility to death receptor-mediated and chemotherapy-induced apoptosis.","['Dong, J', 'Naito, M', 'Tsuruo, T']","['Dong J', 'Naito M', 'Tsuruo T']","['Institute of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences, The University of Tokyo, Bunkyo-ku, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)']",IM,"['Antibodies/pharmacology', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/*genetics', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Mutagenesis', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/metabolism', 'Recombination, Genetic', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology', 'fas Receptor/immunology/metabolism']",1997/08/07 00:00,1997/08/07 00:01,['1997/08/07 00:00'],"['1997/08/07 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/08/07 00:01 [medline]', '1997/08/07 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1201237 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 1997 Aug 7;15(6):639-47. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1201237.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Immunophenotyping showed that most peripheral blood mononuclear cells were negative with B lymphoid, myeloid, and stem cell-associated markers and were also negative with most T lymphoid markers (CD2, CD4, membrane/cytoplasmic CD3, CD5 and CD8). However, they were positive with CD38 (70%), CD7 (25%) and TIA-2 (25%). Molecular analysis showed a clonal rearrangement of the TCR beta and gamma chain genes. The patient was initially treated with vincristine, doxorubicin and asparaginase and then with six cycles of CHOP, achieving a complete remission and remaining free of disease 22 months from diagnosis. Aberrant immunophenotypes are not frequent in primary T cell leukemias. This is the first case of a rare type of T cell neoplasm, Sezary cell-like leukemia, in which cells lacked most of the T cell-associated antigens.","['Orero, M', 'Miguel-Sosa, A', 'Miguel-Garcia, A', 'Tarin, F', 'McCarty, K', 'Carbonell, F', 'Matutes, E', 'Sanchez, M']","['Orero M', 'Miguel-Sosa A', 'Miguel-Garcia A', 'Tarin F', 'McCarty K', 'Carbonell F', 'Matutes E', 'Sanchez M']",,['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Letter']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Adult', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*pathology']",1997/08/01 00:00,1997/08/01 00:01,['1997/08/01 00:00'],"['1997/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2400709 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1997 Aug;11(8):1383-5. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2400709.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Generally, the increased LPL activity prevents an extreme rise in TG levels upon therapy with corticosteroids. In our patient, we found that the corticosteroid-induced LPL activity dramatically declined after therapy with L-asparaginase. This suggests that the extensive hypertriglyceridemia in our patient was due to an L-asparaginase-induced decrease in LPL activity.

I review the recent findings from my group that leukemia is inherited with 'anticipation', in the form of a declining age of onset with each passing generation. I consider two models of leukemia genesis that can potentially account for anticipation in familial cases and incorporate epidemiological observations made in sporadic cases. The first model is analogous to trinucleotide repeat expansion in Huntington disease, myotonic dystrophy, and other inherited neurodegenerative illness demonstrating anticipation. The second model considers evidence that anticipation may be common to multiple types of familial cancer and is based on the intergenerational inheritance of multiple downstream mutations resulting from a defect in a single DNA repair gene.","['Horwitz, M']",['Horwitz M'],"['Markey Molecular Medicine Center, Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle 98195-7720, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA, Satellite)']",IM,"['Ataxia Telangiectasia/complications', 'Bloom Syndrome/complications', 'Chromosome Fragility', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8', 'DNA Repair', 'DNA, Satellite', 'Down Syndrome/complications', 'Fanconi Anemia/complications', 'Genes', 'Genes, Dominant', 'Genes, Recessive', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes/complications', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Li-Fraumeni Syndrome/complications', 'Multigene Family', 'Neurofibromatoses/complications', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Trinucleotide Repeats', 'Trisomy']",1997/08/01 00:00,1997/08/01 00:01,['1997/08/01 00:00'],"['1997/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2400707 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1997 Aug;11(8):1347-59. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2400707.,205,,['HD0108-03/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since unlike their normal counterparts, triggering of their TCR/CD3 in vitro elicits only a weak mitogenic response, we set out to determine which of the signal transduction molecules initiated by anti-CD3E antibodies are affected in neoplastic cells. The results obtained from analysis of tumor cells from four patients show a general reduction in basal and induced tyrosine phosphorylation of a wide range of signaling proteins. Furthermore, the function of members from distinct families of protein tyrosine kinases was altered in neoplastic cells. The enzymatic activity of the membrane-bound fraction of Csk was suppressed, and its association with other cellular proteins was altered. There was a decline in the amount and activity of Syk, and a slight decrease in the specific activity of Lck kinases. Zap70 tyrosyl phosphorylation was reduced or undetectable and the kinase associated weakly, or not at all, with the TCR zeta chain.

In this study, the prolactin (cytokine)-dependent Nb2-11 and autonomous Nb2-SFJCD1 sublines were compared for in vitro thiol growth requirements. Whereas Nb2-11 culture growth depended on 2-mercaptoethanol (2-ME; 33-100 microM), Nb2-SFJCD1 cells were 2-ME-independent. This difference stemmed from differential uptake of exogenous L-cystine, critically required for proliferation. Uptake of 35S-L-cystine (10 microCi/ml; 40 microM) showed Nb2-11 cells had low cystine uptake capability; 2-ME enhanced cystine uptake to growth-sustaining levels. Nb2-SFJCD1 cells did not require 2-ME due to intrinsic, 11-fold higher cystine uptake via the x(c)- cystine/glutamate transport system. In absence of 2-ME, monosodium glutamate abrogated Nb2-SFJCD1 proliferation by specifically inhibiting cystine uptake (85% at 10 mM). Elevated glutathione (GSH) levels were not essential for growth of either line as shown with L-buthionine-(S,R)-sulfoximine (0.1-4 mM) treatment. The cyst(e)ine requirement therefore did not primarily involve maintenance of normal GSH levels, reported critical for T lymphocyte replication. These and other results suggest increased cystine uptake capability constitutes another potential step in progression of T cell cancers which is not coupled to cytokine autonomy or metastatic ability development.

The pathophysiology of this syndrome remains largely unknown. In order to gain insight into its pathophysiology, we studied the clinical characteristics and performed serum analysis (auto-antibodies, cytokine levels) and phenotypic and cytogenetic studies of bone marrow plasma cells (BMPC) in six patients with unequivocal POEMS syndrome. Two unusual clinical signs were present in these patients: pulmonary hypertension (two patients) and diffuse cutaneous necrosis (one patient). No auto-antibodies against peripheral nerve (PN) antigens (SGPG and SGLPG glycolipids, GM1, GD1a, GD1b and GT1b gangliosides) were found. Sequential evaluations of serum cytokines (IL-1-beta, IL-6 and TNF-alpha) showed a moderate to marked elevations of IL-6 and TNF-alpha in all patients (up to six-fold for TNF-alpha and 16-fold for IL-6). Using in situ hybridization of these cytokines mRNAs on lymph node specimens of two patients who had an angiofollicular lymph node hyperplasia, a strong positivity was found with the IL-1-beta antisense probe in lymph node macrophages. On skin biopsy a high number of cells expressing TNF-alpha mRNA was observed in the dermis. The biological features of BMPC: phenotype (expression of CD19 and CD56 antigens), kinetics (Ki-67 index), karyotype, DNA content and chromosomal in situ hybridization remained those of BMPC found in monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance. We conclude that POEMS syndrome is a hypercytokinemic syndrome in which BMPC are not of malignant type.

All 12 patients with T cell receptor beta gene rearrangements at diagnosis are still alive whereas the median survival for 28 patients with a germline configuration at diagnosis was 40 months (chi2 = 5.8, P > 0.01).

Two colour flow cytometry with biotinylated autologous immunoglobulin fragments demonstrated idiotype-reactive T cells in the peripheral blood of five out of 15 patients all of whom had T cell gene rearrangements. The remaining 10 patients had neither idiotype-reactive T cells nor a detectable T cell receptor beta gene rearrangement in concurrent samples. Thus in patients with myeloma there was a good correlation between the presence of T cell receptor beta gene rearrangements and idiotype-reactive T cells.

We found that B-CLL cells could be induced to DNA synthesis upon treatment with IL-15 + Trx. The presence of Trx was essential for the IL-15-induced DNA synthesis. This contrasts to the effect of IL-15 + Trx on normal CD5+ and CD5- B cells, where IL-15 + Trx alone only induced limited DNA synthesis. IL-15 was as effective in the induction of DNA synthesis in B-CLL cells as IL-2, but about 100-fold less potent with an EC50 of 200 ng/ml.

We show that treatment of K562 cells with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) which induces megakaryocytic differentiation, leads to a seven-fold increase in CD9 expression, which becomes associated with the integrin beta1, suggesting that it is functionally relevant. The upregulation of CD9 expression precedes the appearance of the megakaryocytic-specific marker GPIIb (CD41) as well as integrins beta3 (GPIIIa/CD61), alpha v (CD51) and VLA-2 (CD49b). Both GPIIb/IIIa expression and CD9 upregulation are dependent on protein kinase C (PKC) activation since they are blocked by the specific inhibitor GF109203X. Steady-state levels of CD9 and GPIIb mRNA were also measured by quantitative RT-PCR. Both messengers were detected on resting cells and were shown to accumulate during TPA treatment. However, the increase of the CD9 mRNA was detected much earlier than the increase of GPIIb mRNA (1-2 h vs 24-48 h). Using different constructs of the 5'-flanking domain of the CD9 gene cloned ahead of the CAT reporter gene, we could demonstrate that a responsive element was located in a 52 bp fragment of the promoter of the CD9 gene.

This is not a toxic effect of the drug because once that is removed, HSC resume clonal growth and, given sufficient time, form as many cells as HSC in untreated cultures. Amphotericin B-evoked inhibition of blood formation is probably mediated by transmembrane communication between HSC and stroma for the following reasons: (1) AB does not stop HSC forming colony-forming units in culture (CFU-c) when HSC are separated from stroma by culturing them on Transwell inserts above the stroma. (2) Conditioned media (CM) from AB-containing or normal long-term cultures (LTC) does not inhibit normal marrow cells forming colonies in semi-solid cultures without stromal underlays. (3) AB itself does not stop bone marrow cells forming colonies in semi-solid cultures nor does it stop stromal cells growing or prejudice their long-term maintenance. (4) Furthermore, growing stromal cells with AB does not alter the number of transcripts they form for cytokines and chemokines to any large extent, including TGF-beta1. We have extensive, though circumstantial, evidence that gap junctions are involved in this communication. AB only stopped the growth of HSC when we blocked intercellular communication via gap junctions (GJIC) (tested by micro-injection of lucifer yellow). Lipophilic compounds that do not affect GJIC had no effect on the growth of HSC. Looking at a series of stromal cell lines from foetal liver and neonatal bone marrow we found that extensive GJIC correlated with stromal support of the late-appearing clones formed by primitive HSC (week 3-5 cobblestone-area forming cells, CAFC). We propose that the proliferation of HSC is regulated via transmembrane communication between stromal and HSC. Our findings support the proposal that gap junctions play a part in this stromal-dependent regulation.","['Rosendaal, M', 'Mayen, A', 'de Koning, A', 'Dunina-Barkovskaya, T', 'Krenacs, T', 'Ploemacher, R']","['Rosendaal M', 'Mayen A', 'de Koning A', 'Dunina-Barkovskaya T', 'Krenacs T', 'Ploemacher R']","['Department of Anatomy and Developmental Biology, University College London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '7XU7A7DROE (Amphotericin B)']",IM,"['Amphotericin B/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Animals', '*Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Communication/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Cytokines/genetics', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Gap Junctions/physiology', '*Hematopoiesis/drug effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics']",1997/08/01 00:00,1997/08/01 00:01,['1997/08/01 00:00'],"['1997/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2400744 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1997 Aug;11(8):1281-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2400744.,,,['Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Northern blot analysis showed that the cIg+ ALL samples expressed greater amounts of mu-chain transcripts than the cIg- ALL samples.

Our data suggest that a phenotype of ALL, 'pre-B' or 'early pre-B', is associated with V(H)-D-J(H) gene recombinatorial events, and that the CD10+ CD19+ surface Ig- population in the BM is not simply the cellular origin of ALL.","['Mori, H', 'Kiyoi, H', 'Horibe, K', 'Ohno, R', 'Naoe, T']","['Mori H', 'Kiyoi H', 'Horibe K', 'Ohno R', 'Naoe T']","['Department of Pediatrics, Nagoya University School of Medicine, Showa-ku, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Immunoglobulin mu-Chains)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', 'EC 3.4.24.11 (Neprilysin)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD19/analysis', 'B-Lymphocytes/*physiology', 'Base Sequence', 'Bone Marrow/*physiology', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Cell Separation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Heavy Chain', '*Genes, Immunoglobulin', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin mu-Chains/genetics', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neprilysin/analysis', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic']",1997/08/01 00:00,1997/08/01 00:01,['1997/08/01 00:00'],"['1997/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2400740 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1997 Aug;11(8):1274-80. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2400740.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The goal of our study was to draw a comprehensive phenotypic map of the three major maturational BCP stages in BM. By correlating lineage-associated markers, CD45RA, and several adhesion molecules, the stage-specific patterns were found to differ in certain details from previously published concepts. Among the earliest BCP, a subset of CD34+ CD10(lo) precursors was repeatedly observed in addition to the well characterized CD34+ CD10(hi) CD19+ majority of cells. Only two-thirds of these CD34+ CD10(lo) cells expressed CD19. However, uniformity of phenotypic features, absence of T lineage markers, and the regeneration kinetics after chemotherapy suggest the B lineage affiliation of the CD34+ CD10(lo) precursors in general. In the more mature BCP, expression of CD10, CD20, cytoplasmic and surface mu chains (c mu and s mu) was observed to overlap more than previously recognized. We found that CD20 and c mu appear early during B cell ontogeny (already on CD34+ BCP), and that CD10 is lost late, following the onset of s mu expression. Differences between normal and post-chemotherapy BM specimens regarding the phenotypic appearance of BCP were exclusively due to differences in the subset composition, as post-chemotherapy samples showed a preponderance of immature stages. Our observations may build a framework for comparing leukemic cells with their normal counterparts to define possible leukemia-associated aberrations useful for residual disease studies.","['Dworzak, M N', 'Fritsch, G', 'Fleischer, C', 'Printz, D', 'Froschl, G', 'Buchinger, P', 'Mann, G', 'Gadner, H']","['Dworzak MN', 'Fritsch G', 'Fleischer C', 'Printz D', 'Froschl G', 'Buchinger P', 'Mann G', 'Gadner H']","[""Children's Cancer Research Institute, St Anna Kinderspital, Vienna, Austria.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Immunoglobulin mu-Chains)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/analysis', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'B-Lymphocytes/*cytology', '*Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Hematopoiesis/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin mu-Chains/metabolism', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/drug therapy/pathology', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/metabolism']",1997/08/01 00:00,1997/08/01 00:01,['1997/08/01 00:00'],"['1997/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2400732 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1997 Aug;11(8):1266-73. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2400732.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is unknown however, what determines the type of secondary rearrangement. Also the biological basis of the variable degree of oligoclonality observed in childhood ALL is poorly understood. We analyzed in detail the IgH rearrangement status of the leukemic cells for a random panel of 18 childhood B precursor ALL patients by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)/sequencing analysis and by Southern analysis. By Southern analysis 10/18 (55.6%) patients were considered oligoclonal and 8/18 (44.4%) monoclonal. In contrast, by PCR minor clonal rearrangements were detected in 14/18 (77.8%) patients. V(H)-replacement was found in 7/14 patients, V(H) to D-J(H) joining in 6/14 patients and an unusual type of secondary rearrangement, V(H)-D to J(H) joining, in one patient. Only a single type of secondary rearrangement was detected in each patient. The type of secondary rearrangement (V(H)-replacement or V(H) to D-J(H) joining) depended on the rearrangement status (VDJ/VDJ or VDJ/DJ, respectively) of the dominant leukemic clone as determined by Southern analysis. We found that in addition to a more 'advanced' IgH rearrangement status patients with V(H)-replacements also have a more 'advanced' TCRdelta rearrangement status, which possibly reflects exposure of both the IgH locus and the TCRdelta locus to recombinase activity in a preleukemic clone. Finally, we investigated a putative relationship between oligoclonality by Southern analysis and S-phase fraction of the leukemic cell population. We found a significantly lower percentage cells in S-phase for oligoclonal patients as compared to monoclonal patients. Our data add to the understanding of ongoing rearrangement of antigen receptor loci in childhood ALL and have implications for the monitoring of minimal residual disease by PCR.","['Steenbergen, E J', 'Verhagen, O J', 'van den Berg, H', 'van Leeuwen, E F', 'Behrendt, H', 'Slater, R R', 'von dem Borne, A E', 'van der Schoot, C E']","['Steenbergen EJ', 'Verhagen OJ', 'van den Berg H', 'van Leeuwen EF', 'Behrendt H', 'Slater RR', 'von dem Borne AE', 'van der Schoot CE']","['Central Laboratory of the Netherlands Blood Transfusion Service, Amsterdam.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Clone Cells', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', '*Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Heavy Chain', '*Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Humans', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'S Phase']",1997/08/01 00:00,1997/08/01 00:01,['1997/08/01 00:00'],"['1997/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2400720 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1997 Aug;11(8):1258-65. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2400720.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The expression and function of the CD95 antigen on leukemic blasts from 42 patients with B lineage and 53 patients with T lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) were investigated using immunofluorescence staining and apoptosis assays. The CD95 surface antigen was expressed in most ALL cases, with the T lineage ALL usually showing a higher intensity of surface CD95 expression as compared with the B lineage ALL cells (relative fluorescence intensity, RFI: 4.8 +/- 0.47 vs 2.2 +/- 0.23, respectively, P < 0.01). Functional studies disclosed that upon oligomerization by anti-CD95 monoclonal antibodies the CD95 protein was either not able to initiate apoptosis of leukemic cells (75% of cases) or induced low rates of apoptosis (20% of cases). Only in 5% of cases did the apoptosis rate exceed the 20% level of the CD95-specific apoptosis. Most of the CD95-sensitive cases were found among T lineage ALLs (38% of T lineage vs 10% of B lineage ALLs). Overall, the extent of CD95-induced apoptosis did not correlate with the expression level of CD95. Similarly, no significant correlation between expression level and functionality of CD95 in human leukemia cell lines of B and T cell origin could be observed. Bcl-2 protein has been associated with prolonged cell survival and has been shown to block partially CD95-mediated apoptosis, but for ALL cells no correlation between bcl-2 expression and spontaneous or CD95-mediated apoptosis could be found. The results obtained in this study indicate that, despite constitutive expression of CD95, the ALL cells are mainly resistant to CD95-triggering. More detailed investigations of the molecular mechanisms involved in the intracellular apoptotic signal transduction, such as interactions of the bcl-2 and the other members of the bcl-2 family, and functionality of the interleukin-1beta converting enzyme (ICE) like-proteases, may give new insights into key events responsible for the resistance or sensitivity to the induction of apoptosis in acute leukemia.","['Karawajew, L', 'Wuchter, C', 'Ruppert, V', 'Drexler, H', 'Gruss, H J', 'Dorken, B', 'Ludwig, W D']","['Karawajew L', 'Wuchter C', 'Ruppert V', 'Drexler H', 'Gruss HJ', 'Dorken B', 'Ludwig WD']","['Department of Hematology, Oncology, and Tumor Immunology, Robert-Rossle Clinic, Humboldt University of Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (fas Receptor)']",IM,"['Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis', '*Apoptosis', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'fas Receptor/*physiology']",1997/08/01 00:00,1997/08/01 00:01,['1997/08/01 00:00'],"['1997/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2400746 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1997 Aug;11(8):1245-52. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2400746.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The death-related cysteine proteases of the caspases family play a central role in the execution phase of apoptosis, and we recently reported the importance of serine protease activation in camptothecin-induced apoptotic endonuclease activation in HL60 cells. In the present study, we investigated the role of caspases (ICE/CED-3-related cysteine proteases) and serine proteases in cell death induced by the topoisomerase I inhibitor, camptothecin, in HL60 cells and in a cell-free system. We found that CPP32 is activated during camptothecin-induced apoptosis, and that N-benzyloxycarbony-Val-Ala-Asp (O-methyl) -fluoromethyketone (Z-VAD-fmk), a cell permeable caspase inhibitor blocks all features of apoptosis: morphological changes, cleavage of caspase 3 (CPP32/Yama/Apopain) and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, lamin B degradation and DNA fragmentation. However, Z-VAD-fmk and two other ICE/CED-3 inhibitors, YVAD-CHO and DEVD-CHO, were inactive in a cell-free system reconstituted from nuclei of untreated HL60 cells and cytosol from camptothecin-treated cells, suggesting that caspases are not required for endonuclease activation or lamin B cleavage in the cell-free system. By contrast, the serine protease inhibitors, 3,4-dichloroisocoumarin (DCI) and L-1-chloro-3-(4-tosylamido)-4-phenyl-2-butanone tosyl-L-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone (TPCK), abolished the apoptosis-associated biochemical changes induced by camptothecin both in whole cells and in a cell-free system. DCI also inhibited CPP32 cleavage. Taken together, these results suggest that in HL60 cells, both CPP32 and serine proteases are activated in camptothecin-induced apoptosis.","['Shimizu, T', 'Pommier, Y']","['Shimizu T', 'Pommier Y']","['Division of Basic Sciences, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892-4955, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones)', '0 (Coumarins)', '0 (Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Isocoumarins)', '0 (Lamin Type B)', '0 (Lamins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Prodrugs)', '0 (Serine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (benzyloxycarbonylvalyl-alanyl-aspartyl fluoromethyl ketone)', '26656-46-2 (Poly Adenosine Diphosphate Ribose)', '51050-59-0 (3,4-dichloroisocoumarin)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Serine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'XT3Z54Z28A (Camptothecin)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Camptothecin/*pharmacology', 'Caspase 3', '*Caspases', 'Cell Nucleus/drug effects', 'Cell-Free System', 'Coumarins/pharmacology', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/*metabolism', 'Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'Gene Deletion', 'Genes, p53', 'HL-60 Cells/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Isocoumarins', 'Lamin Type B', 'Lamins', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Poly Adenosine Diphosphate Ribose/metabolism', 'Prodrugs', 'Serine Endopeptidases/metabolism', 'Serine Proteinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/physiology']",1997/08/01 00:00,1997/08/01 00:01,['1997/08/01 00:00'],"['1997/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2400734 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1997 Aug;11(8):1238-44. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2400734.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated 21 DNA samples of childhood ALL which had LOH at 12p13. Rearrangement of TEL was observed in eight cases and another case showed a homozygous deletion of TEL. Two informative samples with TEL rearrangement had a deletion localized to the 5' region of this gene. The deletion in these two cases includes the helix-loop-helix (HLH) domain. This is consistent with the hypothesis that the normal tel can heterodimerize with the TEL/AML-1 gene product and inhibit the transforming capacity of the chimeric protein. Presumably, loss of the HLH of the normal remaining TEL allele abrogates this tumor suppressor-like function. The case with homozygous deletion of TEL is also consistent with this gene having qualities of a tumor suppressor. One unusual case had T-ALL rather than B-lineage ALL and the leukemic cells had rearrangement of TEL, but they did not have an alteration of the remaining TEL allele suggesting that the etiology of this disease may be different. This analysis further emphasizes the importance of loss of the normal TEL allele in childhood precursor B-lineage ALL.","['Takeuchi, S', 'Seriu, T', 'Bartram, C R', 'Golub, T R', 'Reiter, A', 'Miyoshi, I', 'Gilliland, D G', 'Koeffler, H P']","['Takeuchi S', 'Seriu T', 'Bartram CR', 'Golub TR', 'Reiter A', 'Miyoshi I', 'Gilliland DG', 'Koeffler HP']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Cedars-Sinai Research Institute, UCLA School of Medicine, Los Angeles, CA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (ETS translocation variant 6 protein)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Blotting, Southern', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Child', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 12', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets', '*Repressor Proteins', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics']",1997/08/01 00:00,1997/08/01 00:01,['1997/08/01 00:00'],"['1997/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2400743 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1997 Aug;11(8):1220-3. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2400743.,,,"['CA26038/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA43277/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK42792/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

If treatment is not initiated promptly, the mortality is high. The incidence of this disease is rising in patients with hematologic malignancies. Increasing numbers of patients with solid tumors are subject to high dose chemotherapy regimens or new drugs known to cause severe neutropenia. Therefore, the frequency of this disease can be expected to increase. METHODS: The authors report a patient with colorectal carcinoma who developed neutropenic enterocolitis after treatment with 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin. RESULTS: The patient developed the typical clinical picture of abdominal pain, diarrhea, and neutropenia. The course was complicated by a recurrence of symptoms after initially successful antibiotic therapy without the patient receiving further chemotherapy.

HePC shows antiproliferative action against a whole variety of tumor cells and tumors in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, it also induces differentiation in some hematologic cell lines and prevents invasive growth of neoplastic cells in vitro. To date, the precise molecular mechanisms mediating the biological effects of HePC have not been identified yet. As etherlysophospholipids seem to inhibit some pathways of lipid-dependent intracellular signalling, similar effects may be relevant for HePC. We therefore investigated the influence of HePC on phospholipase A2 (PLA2-EC 3.1.1) in the human leukemia cell line U 937. HePC seems to inhibit enzyme activity independently of protein kinase C (PKC) in differentiated U 937 cells stimulated by tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha). Inhibition of purified secretory PLA2 from snake venom (EC 3.1.1.4) in vitro shows characteristics of a non-competitive mode. In contrast, HePC leads to an enhancement of PLA2 activity in immature cells which cannot be explained by changes in membrane composition. Our data suggest that PLA, inhibition is most probably not the mechanism by which HePC mediates its antiproliferative effects.","['Berkovic, D', 'Luders, S', 'Goeckenjan, M', 'Hiddemann, W', 'Fleer, E A']","['Berkovic D', 'Luders S', 'Goeckenjan M', 'Hiddemann W', 'Fleer EA']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology at the University Clinic of Gottingen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Phospholipids)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '107-73-3 (Phosphorylcholine)', '53EY29W7EC (miltefosine)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 3.1.1.32 (Phospholipases A)', 'EC 3.1.1.4 (Phospholipases A2)']",IM,"['Acylation', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Humans', 'Phospholipases A/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Phospholipases A2', 'Phospholipids/analysis', 'Phosphorylcholine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase C/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology']",1997/06/01 00:00,1997/06/01 00:01,['1997/06/01 00:00'],"['1997/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-2952(97)00095-6 [pii]', '10.1016/s0006-2952(97)00095-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1997 Jun 1;53(11):1725-33. doi: 10.1016/s0006-2952(97)00095-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cells exposed to either 20 nM taxol for 1 hr or 10 nM taxol for 12 hr were able to resume normal growth, whereas cells exposed to 60 nM taxol for 1 hr or 10 nM taxol for 24 hr failed to proliferate after drug removal. Progressive changes in the percentage of mitotic block and apoptosis induced by these four treatment protocols were monitored continuously for 3-5 days after drug removal. Cells treated with 20 nM taxol for 1 hr showed a mitotic block without a subsequent increase in apoptosis, whereas cells treated with 10 nM taxol for 12 hr showed an increase in apoptotic ratio within several hours without an increase in mitotic block. These results indicate that apoptosis does not necessarily result from mitotic block and that these two phenomena can occur independently of each other. Drug sensitivity at progressive stages of the cell cycle was also investigated. The results showed that, in addition to the cells in G2/M phase, the cells in S phase were also sensitive to the drug, especially to a prolonged treatment.

To assess the utility of measurements of aflatoxin-albumin adducts to predict risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), 123 male F344 rats were dosed with 20 microg of AFB1 daily for 5 weeks after randomization into three groups: no intervention; delayed-transient (500 ppm of oltipraz, weeks 2 and 3 relative to AFB1); or persistent (500 ppm oltipraz, weeks -1 to 5). Serial blood samples were collected from each animal at weekly intervals throughout aflatoxin B1 exposure and assayed for levels of aflatoxin-albumin by radioimmune assay. Area under the curve (AUC) values for aflatoxin-albumin adducts decreased 20 and 39% in the delayed-transient and persistent oltipraz intervention groups, respectively, as compared to no intervention. Similarly, the total incidence of HCC dropped from 83 to 60% (P = 0.03) and 48% (P < 0.01) in these groups. Tumor multiplicity was also reduced in the two oltipraz intervention groups, whereas time to HCC was increased. Mononuclear cell leukemia, a common neoplasm in F344 rats, was seen in 39% of the control animals, whereas the two oltipraz interventions reduced incidence to 18% (P = 0.05) and 13% (P = 0.01), respectively. Overall, a significant association was seen between biomarker AUC and risk of HCC (P = 0.01). However, when the predictive value of aflatoxin-albumin adducts was assessed within treatment groups, there was no association between AUC and risk of HCC (P = 0.56). Thus, aflatoxin-albumin adducts can be useful for monitoring population-based changes induced by interventions, such as in chemoprevention trials, but have limited utility in identifying individuals destined to develop HCC. As a consequence, the use of this biomarker in quantitative risk assessment should be pursued cautiously.","['Kensler, T W', 'Gange, S J', 'Egner, P A', 'Dolan, P M', 'Munoz, A', 'Groopman, J D', 'Rogers, A E', 'Roebuck, B D']","['Kensler TW', 'Gange SJ', 'Egner PA', 'Dolan PM', 'Munoz A', 'Groopman JD', 'Rogers AE', 'Roebuck BD']","['Department of Environmental Health Sciences, Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health, Baltimore, Maryland 21205, USA. tkensler@phnet.sph.jhu.edu']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev,"Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology",9200608,"['0 (Anticarcinogenic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (DNA Adducts)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '0 (Thiones)', '0 (Thiophenes)', '0 (aflatoxin B1-DNA adduct)', '6N510JUL1Y (oltipraz)', '9N2N2Y55MH (Aflatoxin B1)']",IM,"['*Aflatoxin B1/*blood', 'Animals', 'Anticarcinogenic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*blood', '*Carcinogens', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*drug effects/pathology', 'DNA Adducts/*blood', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Liver Neoplasms, Experimental/*chemically induced/pathology', 'Male', 'Pyrazines/*pharmacology', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred F344', 'Thiones', 'Thiophenes']",1997/08/01 00:00,1997/08/01 00:01,['1997/08/01 00:00'],"['1997/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev. 1997 Aug;6(8):603-10.,,,"['CA39416/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'ES03819/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'ES06052/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Dependent on the presence and activity of local survival factors, monocytes may undergo apoptosis. Therefore, we looked for the interaction between cultured human mesangial cells (HMC) and intact, necrotic or apoptotic monocytic cells with different stages of programmed cell death (U937 cells and blood-derived human monocytes) and the possible evoked secretory responses of HMC. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) synthesis of HMC after a two hour co-culture with late apoptotic U937 cells was significantly increased (505 +/- 55 pg/ml) as compared to intact U937 cells (349 +/- 27 pg/ml; HMC alone, 319 +/- 62 pg/ml), and was further elevated after 20 hours (815 +/- 108 pg/ml). U937 cells alone, after incubation in HMC-conditioned medium or after coincubation with HMC, did not produce any detectable IL-6. A high mesangial IL-6 synthesis in response to apoptotic U937 cells was dependent on the cellular contact between HMC and U937 and could not be mimicked by apoptotic U937 culture supernatants. Radiolabeling studies indicated that HMC bound (16.6 +/- 2.4%) and ingested (12.5 +/- 1.9%) apoptotic U937 cells to a much higher amount as compared to intact U937 (5.3 +/- 2.0% binding; 5.0 +/- 1.1% phagocytosis). Binding and ingestion of monocytic cells undergoing apoptosis was confirmed by morphologic studies using electron microscopy. Incubation of HMC with a blocker of the CD36/ vitronectin receptor (VnR) dependent recognition mechanism of phagocytes for apoptotic leukocytes (RGDS peptide) did not alter binding, phagocytosis or IL-6 synthesis of HMC in response to apoptotic U937. Phospho-L-serine as an antagonist of the phosphatidylserine (PS) mediated recognition pathway for apoptotic cell disposal was able to reduce binding and IL-6 production by HMC but not phagocytosis. Thus, binding of apoptotic monocytic cells by HMC rather than ingestion may be the prerequisite for a stimulated secretory response. To elucidate whether binding and phagocytosis of particles in general might stimulate HMC to produce IL-6, we looked for mesangial IL-6 production after binding and ingestion of opsonized zymosan particles. In this case, IL-6 synthesis was markedly down-regulated. Furthermore, HMC proliferated after zymosan treatment, whereas after apoptotic cell uptake the mesangial cell number remained constant. In conclusion, apoptotic monocytic cells provoked an enhanced mesangial IL-6 synthesis by a PS-dependent recognition mechanism. This secretory response may have secondary implications for humoral or cellular processes within the mesangium.","['Heidenreich, S', 'Sato, T', 'Schmidt, M', 'August, C', 'Timmerman, J J', 'van Es, L A', 'Daha, M R']","['Heidenreich S', 'Sato T', 'Schmidt M', 'August C', 'Timmerman JJ', 'van Es LA', 'Daha MR']","['Department of Nephrology, University Hospital Leiden, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Kidney Int,Kidney international,0323470,"['0 (Interleukin-6)', '17885-08-4 (Phosphoserine)', '9010-72-4 (Zymosan)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Culture Techniques/methods', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Glomerular Mesangium/*cytology/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/*biosynthesis', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Monocytes/immunology/*metabolism', 'Phagocytosis/physiology', 'Phosphoserine/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/cytology/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Zymosan/pharmacology']",1997/08/01 00:00,1997/08/01 00:01,['1997/08/01 00:00'],"['1997/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0085-2538(15)60177-6 [pii]', '10.1038/ki.1997.337 [doi]']",ppublish,Kidney Int. 1997 Aug;52(2):318-28. doi: 10.1038/ki.1997.337.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A remarkable weight loss occurred in the 20 micrograms/day group, but no weight loss was detected at doses of less than 10 micrograms/day. The rhLIF dose of 4 micrograms/day was therefore used to examine the protective effect against carboplatin-induced thrombocytopenia in mice. The intravenous injection of 100 mg/kg carboplatin caused a significant thrombocytopenia with a nadir on day 8. The administration of 4 micrograms/day rhLIF intraperitoneally for 7 days promoted the recovery of platelet counts from day 5 after the injection of carboplatin.

The disease process in chronic MPD affects a pluripotent progenitor cell and results in trilineage hematopoietic proliferation. Clonal involvement of megakaryocytopoiesis is regarded as the main origin of thromboembolism in MPD and results in abnormal platelet production. These platelets show increased size heterogeneity and ultrastructural abnormalities, and their function in vitro is in many ways impaired with a high degree of individual variability. Elevated levels of platelet-specific proteins, increased thromboxane generation, and expression of activation-dependent epitopes on the platelet surface are common on chronic MPD, and may reflect an inappropriate state of platelet activation. Although a variety of platelet receptor deficiencies and some defects of intracellular signaling pathways have been identified, the different platelet defects in MPD could not be traced back to an underlying general pathogenetic mechanism. On progression of chronic MPD to more advanced stages of the disease, the number of platelet abnormalities tend to increase. Cytoreductive drugs may partly improve platelet dysfunction, and platelet inhibitory agents reduce symptoms of platelet activation. However, neither of these therapeutic principles is able to normalize platelet function in MPD. As an alternative to conventional treatment, specific suppression of clonal megakaryocyte growth and recovery of polyclonal hematopoiesis may be achieved by biologic agents such as interferon alpha. Such treatment strategies may prevent thromboembolic complications together with hematologic symptoms and progression of the disease and should be further evaluated in prospective studies.","['Wehmeier, A', 'Sudhoff, T', 'Meierkord, F']","['Wehmeier A', 'Sudhoff T', 'Meierkord F']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology, Oncology and Clinical Immunology, Heinrich-Heine University, Dusseldorf, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Semin Thromb Hemost,Seminars in thrombosis and hemostasis,0431155,"['0 (Alkylating Agents)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors)', '0 (Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins)', '27YG812J1I (Arachidonic Acid)', 'R16CO5Y76E (Aspirin)']",IM,"['Alkylating Agents/therapeutic use', 'Arachidonic Acid/metabolism', 'Aspirin/therapeutic use', 'Bleeding Time', 'Blood Platelets/metabolism/*pathology', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hemorrhage/blood/*etiology', 'Hemorrhagic Disorders/blood/etiology', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood/complications', 'Megakaryocytes/pathology', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/blood/*complications/drug therapy', 'Phlebotomy', 'Platelet Activation', 'Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Thrombophilia/blood/etiology', 'Thrombosis/blood/*etiology']",1997/01/01 00:00,1997/01/01 00:01,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1055/s-2007-996114 [doi]'],ppublish,Semin Thromb Hemost. 1997;23(4):391-402. doi: 10.1055/s-2007-996114.,156,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All patients were harvested once on each machine, five starting on each machine. The target duration of the procedure on the Spectra was 160 minutes, and the target blood volume processed on the MCS-3P was 60-70 ml/kg body weight. Both machines were operating on the 1995 software versions supplied by the respective manufacturers. The time taken for the procedure was significantly longer with the Haemonetics machine. The volumes of blood processed and the product collected were significantly higher with the Spectra, as were the absolute mononuclear and CD34+ cell yields, and yields per unit time. Mononuclear and CD34+ cell yields per unit volume of blood processed were comparable for both machines. The differences in CFU-GM yields were not significant, largely because of wide interpatient variations. The extent of platelet depletion as a result of the procedure was greater with the Spectra because of the higher blood volume being processed.

The results showed that Leu at P8 is predominantly involved in the binding and Pro at P2 is partially involved. Substitution of Gly to Ala at P3 increased binding. We then investigated the epitope residues recognized by four pRL1a-specific CTL clones by examining their cytotoxicity against the P815 target sensitized with variant pRL1a peptides.

Recognition by clone P-2 involved predominantly Leu at P4 and P6, and Ser at P7, with no partial involvement of other substitutions being observed. Finally, recognition by clone B-24 predominantly involved all residues, except Gly at P3, which was partially involved. TCR V beta genes utilized by those CTL clones were different.

During the last decade, several techniques have been proposed and used for detecting MRD. In this review, we report the current PCR based techniques dealing with amplification of the VDJ segment since the CDR3 region is unique to each IgH rearrangement. The sensitivity of these techniques varies considerably with a detection level of one tumoral cell in 10(-2) to 10(-6) normal cells. Accurate and sensitive assessment of MRD may have profound impact in the clinical management of patients with hematologic malignancies. Although, a majority of studies have shown a good correlation between the rapidity or extent of the reduction in the number of tumoral cells and the subsequent relapse, other studies demonstrated substained positivity of PCR in patients in long term remission. Thus, current clinical studies of MRD should establish whether MRD predicts relapse uniformly and, therefore, justifies intensification of therapy in positive cases, or whether it simply detects leukemic cell populations whose proliferative potential has been altered by chemotherapy.","['Maloum, K', 'Pritsch, O', 'Dighiero, G']","['Maloum K', 'Pritsch O', 'Dighiero G']","[""Hopital Pitie-Salpetriere, Departement d'Hematologie, Paris, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",France,Hematol Cell Ther,Hematology and cell therapy,9613253,['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)'],IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/*pathology', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Heavy Chain/*genetics/physiology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics/physiology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*diagnosis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics']",1997/06/01 00:00,1997/06/01 00:01,['1997/06/01 00:00'],"['1997/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00282-997-0119-z [doi]'],ppublish,Hematol Cell Ther. 1997 Jun;39(3):119-24. doi: 10.1007/s00282-997-0119-z.,52,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All of the five cases were serologically positive for anti-FIV antibody and negative for feline leukemia virus antigen. Of these five lymphoma samples, two displayed rearrangement of the Ig heavy chain gene and deletion of the Ig light (kappa) chain gene, indicating that the tumor cells were committed to B-cell development. One tumor sample was identified as a T-cell lymphoma because of the presence of a rearranged TCR beta-chain gene. The other two cases were considered to be non-T non-B cell lymphoma because they did not show any rearrangement of the Ig and TCR genes. Therefore, no consistent tumor type was found in lymphoma cases infected with FIV. Clonal integration of FIV provirus was not detected in any of the five lymphoma samples obtained from FIV-infected cats using Southern blot analysis, although FIV proviral genome was detected in the genomic DNA of all the lymphoma samples by using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR).

Data on cytokines provided by different fields of reproductive immunology and biology were collated. Because of the crucial importance of the local interactions between the embryo and its dam, the expression of growth-factor and cytokine genes was analysed in the embryo proper, trophoblast, oviduct and endometrium by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction in sheep and in cattle during the pre- and periimplantation periods. Many deleterious cytokines, such as tumour necrosis factor-alpha, interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), interleukin-2 (IL-2), and beneficial cytokines, such as transforming growth factor-beta, leukaemia inhibiting factor, colony-stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1), granulocyte-macrophage CSF, IL-1, IL-3, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10 and IFN-tau appeared to be involved in embryo survival in ruminants and other species. Their administration is efficient in a murine experimental model (CBA/J x DBA/2) of embryonic and fetal mortality. For instance, recombinant ovine IFN-tau (roIFN-tau) injected at the moment of implantation drastically reduces embryonic mortality in this model. In ruminants, roIFN-tau and recombinant bovine IFN-tau are very efficient in maintaining progesterone luteal secretion in cyclic animals. The involvement of IFN-tau in the mechanisms of maternal pregnancy recognition are particularly detailed in relation to inhibition of 13,14 dihydro-15-keto-prostaglandin F2 alpha (PGFM) pulses and oxytocin uterine receptivity. A synthetic model of the anti-luteolytic effects of IFN-tau on the endometrial cell is proposed.

Because erythroid progenitors from B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia appeared sensitive to rh-Epo in vitro, we propose that high doses of this drug may be clinically effective in some patients with this disease, regardless of the degree of lymphocytic inflitration of the bone marrow.","['Tsatalas, C', 'Chalkia, P', 'Tsantali, C', 'Kakoulidis, I', 'Garyfallos, A', 'Klonizakis, I', 'Panayiotopoulos, S']","['Tsatalas C', 'Chalkia P', 'Tsantali C', 'Kakoulidis I', 'Garyfallos A', 'Klonizakis I', 'Panayiotopoulos S']","['Fourth Dept. of Internal Medicine, Aristotelian University of Thessaloniki, Ippokration General Hospital, Greece.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",England,J Exp Clin Cancer Res,Journal of experimental & clinical cancer research : CR,8308647,"['0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Bone Marrow/*drug effects', '*Bone Marrow Cells', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/*drug effects', 'Erythropoietin/blood/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/*drug therapy/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology']",1997/06/01 00:00,1997/06/01 00:01,['1997/06/01 00:00'],"['1997/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Exp Clin Cancer Res. 1997 Jun;16(2):163-70.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We focused mainly on results in adults, but included results on pediatric patients when relevant. Our review of the data indicates that 20% to 40% of adults with a history of CNS involvement by lymphoma or lymphoid leukemia can be cured by high-dose chemotherapy. A small fraction of patients with active CNS involvement can be cured as well. No data is available to determine superiority of a particular conditioning regimen or of allogeneic vs. autologous BMT. There is no conclusive benefit to post-transplant intrathecal therapy and the role of cranial or cranio-spinal radiation treatment and its optimal timing remains to be determined.

A 61-year old man had a hard mass in his right lower leg that had rapidly increased in size in the past 10 days. The mass was microscopically composed of a dense proliferation of spindle cells forming interlacing fascicles admixed with an inflammatory infiltrate of lymphocytes and eosionphils, focal hemorrhage, and myxomatous change as typically seen in nodular fasciitis as well as many characteristic ganglion cell-like giant cells. Immunohistochemically, most of the spindle-shaped cells were positive for vimentin and alpha-actin, whereas the ganglion cell-like giant cells were positive for vimentin and negative for alpha-actin and lysozyme. We suggest that the main component cells of proliferative fasciitis are fibroblastic in nature, many of which are myofibroblasts in large part, whereas the ganglion cell-like giant cells are related more closely to fibroblasts rather than histiocytes or pericytes. Additionally, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) stain revealed that many of the fibroblastic cells showed high proliferative activity, especially in the hypercellular areas, although there was no significant difference in PCNA staining between the focus traumatized by the needle biopsy and the nontraumatized areas.","['Kiryu, H', 'Takeshita, H', 'Hori, Y']","['Kiryu H', 'Takeshita H', 'Hori Y']","['Department of Dermatology, Kitakyushu Municipal Medical Center, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Am J Dermatopathol,The American Journal of dermatopathology,7911005,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Coloring Agents)', '0 (Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen)', '0 (Vimentin)', 'EC 3.2.1.17 (Muramidase)']",IM,"['Actins/analysis', 'Angiolipoma/pathology', 'Biopsy, Needle', 'Cell Division', 'Cicatrix/pathology', 'Coloring Agents', 'Diabetes Mellitus/pathology', 'Eosinophils/pathology', 'Fasciitis/*pathology', 'Fibroblasts/pathology', 'Giant Cells/pathology', 'Hemorrhage/pathology', 'Histiocytes/pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leg Dermatoses/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/pathology', 'Lymphocytes/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Muramidase/analysis', 'Neoplasms, Multiple Primary/pathology', 'Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen/analysis', 'Skin Neoplasms/pathology', 'Vimentin/analysis']",1997/08/01 00:00,1997/08/01 00:01,['1997/08/01 00:00'],"['1997/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00000372-199708000-00013 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Dermatopathol. 1997 Aug;19(4):396-9. doi: 10.1097/00000372-199708000-00013.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A comparative study between nodal and cutaneous lymphomas.,391-5,"Advances in the molecular definition of surface proteins (adhesion molecules) involved in tumor metastasis may help to explain the invasive behavior of malignant tumors, that is, the migration of tumor cells involving reversible adhesive contacts, their release in the circulation, and their extravasation into distant sites. Intercellular adhesion molecule-3 (ICAM-3), the third receptor for the lymphocyte function-associated antigen molecule-1 (LFA-1) was recently characterized. We investigated fresh frozen skin biopsies from 10 patients with mycosis fungoides, four with pleomorphic T-cell lymphoma, six with Sezary syndrome, 10 with primary cutaneous B-cell lymphoma, and 10 with eczematous lesions as controls. The biopsies were compared with lymph node biopsies of five patients with known cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL), 10 with primary nodal B-cell lymphoma, and 11 with lymph-node specimens showing dermatopathic lymphadenopathy as controls. The specimens were stained with ICAM-3 antibody (Bender Medical Science) using the alkaline phosphatase antialkaline phosphatase method. Using cytomorphologic criteria, neoplastic lymphocytes could be differentiated from smaller reactive cells. Staining intensities were classified semiquantitatively as follows: 4, strong expression in 75 to 100% of the tumor cells; 3, 50 to 75%; 2, 25 to 50%; 1, 5 to 25%; and 0 fewer than 5% of the tumor cells. The endothelial cells in skin biopsies of seven of 30 primary cutaneous lymphomas expressed ICAM-3. In contrast, no expression of ICAM-3 could be demonstrated on endothelial cells in lymph nodes infiltrated with tumor cells of CTCL. Finally, endothelial cells of lymph nodes infiltrated with primary nodal B-cell lymphomas showed expression of ICAM-3 in three of 10 patients. The endothelial cells in the 11 control patients presenting with both eczematous lesions and dermatopathic lymphadenopathy showed no staining for ICAM-3. Every patient who expressed ICAM-3 on endothelial cells showed systemic spread of this disease. The findings suggest that ICAM-3 expression may be induced on endothelial cells in late-stage cutaneous lymphomas, probably by a cytokine-mediated mechanism.","['Dommann, S N', 'Dommann-Scherrer, C C', 'Ziegler, T', 'Meyer, J', 'Trueb, R M', 'Kundig, T', 'Panizzon, R', 'Burg, G']","['Dommann SN', 'Dommann-Scherrer CC', 'Ziegler T', 'Meyer J', 'Trueb RM', 'Kundig T', 'Panizzon R', 'Burg G']","['Department of Dermatology, University Hospital of Zurich, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Am J Dermatopathol,The American Journal of dermatopathology,7911005,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Coloring Agents)', '0 (ICAM3 protein, human)', '0 (Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1)', 'EC 3.1.3.1 (Alkaline Phosphatase)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Alkaline Phosphatase', '*Antigens, CD', '*Antigens, Differentiation', 'Biopsy', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/analysis/*genetics', 'Cell Movement', 'Coloring Agents', 'Eczema/pathology', 'Endothelium/*pathology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Lymph Nodes/*pathology', 'Lymphatic Diseases/pathology', 'Lymphatic Metastasis/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1/analysis/genetics', 'Lymphocytes/pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/pathology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell, Cutaneous/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mycosis Fungoides/pathology', 'Neoplastic Cells, Circulating/pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/pathology', 'Sezary Syndrome/pathology', 'Skin/pathology', 'Skin Neoplasms/*pathology']",1997/08/01 00:00,1997/08/01 00:01,['1997/08/01 00:00'],"['1997/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00000372-199708000-00012 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Dermatopathol. 1997 Aug;19(4):391-5. doi: 10.1097/00000372-199708000-00012.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This titer was approximately 2 log units higher than that obtained by transinfection of parental PA317 cells and was due to the high level of viral transcripts originating from the tetP promoter at the 5' end of the transduced vector in the presence of tTA.

In the present study, a set of six single-amino-acid substitutions in or near gs4 was used to determine the function of this region of Env and the role played by the glycan itself. One mutant that lacked the gs4 glycan was fully infectious, while one that retained this glycan was completely noninfectious, indicating that the gs4 glycan per se is not required for Env function. Infectivity correlated with the level of mature Env complex incorporated into virus particles, which was determined by the severity of defects in transport of the envelope precursor protein (gPrEnv) from the endoplasmic reticulum into the Golgi apparatus, in cleavage of gPrEnv into the two envelope subunits (the surface protein [SU] and the transmembrane protein [TM]), and in the association of SU with cellular membranes. All of the mutants induced the wild-type level of superinfection interference, indicating that the gs4 region mutations did not interfere with proper folding of the N-terminal domain of SU. These results suggest that the gs4 region mediates folding of the C-terminal domains of gPrEnv and stability of the interaction between SU and TM. Although the gs4 glycan was not essential for infectivity, processing of all mutant Envs lacking this glycan was significantly impaired, suggesting that efficient folding of gPrEnv requires a glycan at this position. The conservation of a glycosylation site homologous to gs4 across a broad range of retroviruses suggests that this sequence may play a similar role in many retroviral Envs.","['Li, Z', 'Pinter, A', 'Kayman, S C']","['Li Z', 'Pinter A', 'Kayman SC']","['Department of Microbiology, New York University School of Medicine, New York, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (Polysaccharides)', '0 (Protein Precursors)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/*metabolism', 'Gene Products, env/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mutagenesis', 'Polysaccharides/*metabolism', 'Protein Biosynthesis', '*Protein Folding', 'Protein Precursors/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'Proteins/metabolism', 'Receptors, Virus/metabolism', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/biosynthesis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/*metabolism']",1997/09/01 00:00,1997/09/01 00:01,['1997/09/01 00:00'],"['1997/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.71.9.7012-7019.1997 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1997 Sep;71(9):7012-9. doi: 10.1128/JVI.71.9.7012-7019.1997.,,,['AI-23884/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,PMC191987,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The primer for this synthetic event is a molecule of cellular tRNA, which is annealed by its 3' 18 nucleotides to a region of the genomic RNA termed the primer-binding site (PBS); the sequence of the PBS and hence the identity of the tRNA depend upon the retrovirus species. In addition to the primer tRNA, retrovirus particles contain a substantial number of other tRNA molecules. The latter tRNA population is enriched for the tRNA species which serves as primer for the virus. While there is considerable evidence that the enrichment for the primer species can be attributed to the pol gene product, nothing is known regarding mechanisms of annealing the primer to the PBS. We have analyzed pol- mutants of avian leukosis virus (ALV) and murine leukemia virus (MuLV) for the presence of primer at the PBS in virion genomic RNA. Remarkably, the results were different for the two viruses: the PBS was substantially occupied by primer in MuLV but not in ALV. Previous data indicates that the Pol-dependent enrichment of the primer within the virion is much greater in ALV than in MuLV. We therefore propose that the absence of primer at the PBS in pol- ALV is due to the deficiency of the primer species within the particle. The results suggest that, at least in MuLV, the tRNA is unwound by either the Gag protein or a cellular protein for annealing to the PBS. Further, the C-terminal 17 amino acids of Gag are unnecessary for this function in MuLV.","['Fu, W', 'Ortiz-Conde, B A', 'Gorelick, R J', 'Hughes, S H', 'Rein, A']","['Fu W', 'Ortiz-Conde BA', 'Gorelick RJ', 'Hughes SH', 'Rein A']","['ABL-Basic Research Program, SAIC, Frederick, Maryland, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (RNA primers)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', '9014-25-9 (RNA, Transfer)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Avian Leukosis Virus/*genetics', 'Binding Sites', 'Chick Embryo', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Expression', '*Genes, pol', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'RNA', '*RNA, Transfer', '*RNA, Viral']",1997/09/01 00:00,1997/09/01 00:01,['1997/09/01 00:00'],"['1997/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.71.9.6940-6946.1997 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1997 Sep;71(9):6940-6. doi: 10.1128/JVI.71.9.6940-6946.1997.,,,,,PMC191978,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This modification facilitates infection of nondividing cells by allowing for the recruitment of the karyophilic MA into the viral core and preintegration complex. MA tyrosine phosphorylation is accomplished by a cellular protein kinase which is incorporated into virions. In this study, we have investigated the nature of this enzyme as well as the determinants of MA necessary for its phosphorylation. Employing an in vitro kinase assay, we found that the MA tyrosine kinase activity is present in various cultured cell lines including CEM and SupT1 T-lymphoid cells, Namalwa B cells, 293 and CV-1 kidney fibroblasts, and P4 HeLa cells. In addition, it could be detected in platelets, macrophages, and activated peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) but not in erythrocytes and resting PBLs isolated from human blood. Subcellular localization of the kinase activity by cell fractionation demonstrated that it is enriched in cellular membranes. In HIV type 2 (HIV-2) particles, the MA tyrosine kinase is associated with the inner leaflet of the viral membrane, while the tyrosine-phosphorylated MA is localized to the core. Individual mutations of each of the last eight residues immediately upstream of the C-terminal tyrosine (Y132) of HIV-1 MA did not prevent Y132 phosphorylation, suggesting that the kinase does not require a highly specific sequence adjacent to the C-terminal tyrosine. Confirming this, we found that the MA of murine leukemia virus, the sequence of which is only moderately homologous to that of HIV-1 and HIV-2 MA, is also C-terminally tyrosine phosphorylated.","['Camaur, D', 'Gallay, P', 'Swingler, S', 'Trono, D']","['Camaur D', 'Gallay P', 'Swingler S', 'Trono D']","['Infectious Disease Laboratory, Salk Institute for Biological Studies, La Jolla, California 92037, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (HIV Antigens)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '0 (gag Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus)', '0 (p17 protein, Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Gene Products, gag/*metabolism', 'HIV Antigens/*metabolism', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Subcellular Fractions', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Tyrosine/*metabolism', '*Viral Proteins', 'gag Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus']",1997/09/01 00:00,1997/09/01 00:01,['1997/09/01 00:00'],"['1997/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.71.9.6834-6841.1997 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1997 Sep;71(9):6834-41. doi: 10.1128/JVI.71.9.6834-6841.1997.,,,['AI37510/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,PMC191964,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Acquisition of these motifs accounts for half of the activity of the complete retroviral enhancer in hematopoietic cells, irrespective of the developmental stage or lineage. Furthermore, the UCR motif contains the major determinant for the enhancer activity of SFFVp in embryonic stem (ES) cells. Using electrophoretic mobility shift assays, we show that the UCR of SFFVp, but not of Friend murine leukemia virus, is targeted by the ubiquitous transcriptional activator, Sp1. The core motif of SFFVp creates a specific and high-affinity target for polyomavirus enhancer binding protein/core binding factor (PEBP/CBF) and excludes access of CAAT/enhancer binding protein.

Detailed statistical analysis of these data proved a significant synergistic interaction between TGF-beta 1 and inhibitors of 5-LPO metabolism. The differentiation effects of TGF-beta 1 alone and especially of its combination with MK-886 were most pronounced when the cells were pretreated with dimethyl sulfoxide or all-trans-retinoic acid. The results imply that either the lack of 5-LPO metabolites or a certain type of mis-balance in arachidonic acid metabolism can modulate the TGF-beta 1 effect on myeloid differentiation.","['Kozubik, A', 'Hofmanova, J', 'Dusek, L', 'Musilova, E']","['Kozubik A', 'Hofmanova J', 'Dusek L', 'Musilova E']","['Institute of Biophysics, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, Brno, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,"['0 (Indoles)', '0 (Lipoxygenase Inhibitors)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '0 (Umbelliferones)', '080626SQ8C (MK-886)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'SM2XD6V944 (esculetin)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells/*cytology', 'Humans', 'Indoles/pharmacology', '*Lipoxygenase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Luminescent Measurements', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/*administration & dosage', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Umbelliferones/pharmacology']",1997/08/01 00:00,1997/08/01 00:01,['1997/08/01 00:00'],"['1997/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jlb.62.2.240 [doi]'],ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 1997 Aug;62(2):240-8. doi: 10.1002/jlb.62.2.240.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The mechanisms by which this occurs were investigated in the present study. This involved examining the effect of hLIF on (1) the level of plasma cholesterol at different times throughout the 4-week treatment and diet period; (2) smooth muscle cell (SMC) and macrophage-derived foam cell formation in vitro; and (3) LDL receptor expression and uptake in the human hepatoma cell line HepG2. At time zero, an osmotic minipump (2-mL capacity; infusion rate, 2.5 microL/h; 28 days) containing either hLIF (30 micrograms kg-1.d-1) or saline was inserted into the peritoneal cavity of New Zealand White rabbits (N = 24). Rabbits were divided into four groups of six animals each. Group 1 received a normal diet/saline; group 2, a normal diet/hLIF; group 3, a 1% cholesterol diet/saline; and group 4, a 1% cholesterol diet/hLIF. hLIF had no effect on the plasma lipids or artery wall of group 2 rabbits (normal diet). However, in group 4 rabbits, plasma cholesterol levels and the percent surface area of thoracic aorta covered by fatty streaks was decreased by approximately 30% and 80%, respectively, throughout all stages of the 4-week treatment period. In vitro, hLIF failed to prevent lipoprotein uptake by either SMCs or macrophages (foam cell formation) when the cells were exposed to beta-VLDL for 24 hours. In contrast, hLIF (100 ng/mL) added to cultured human hepatoma HepG2 cells induced a twofold or threefold increase in intracellular lipid accumulation in the medium containing 10% lipoprotein-deficient serum or 10% fetal calf serum, respectively. This was accompanied by a significant non-dose-dependent increase in LDL receptor expression in hLIF-treated HepG2 cells incubated with LDL (20 micrograms/mL) when compared with controls (P < .05) incubated in control medium alone (P < .05). We suggest that the hLIF-induced lowering of plasma cholesterol and tissue cholesterol levels (inhibition of fatty streak formation) in the hyperlipidemic rabbit is due in part to upregulation of hepatic LDL receptors, with resultant increased clearance of lipoprotein-associated cholesterol from the circulation. There is an additional and as-yet-unknown mechanism acting at the level of the vessel wall that appears to be affecting the process of arterial cholesterol accumulation.","['Moran, C S', 'Campbell, J H', 'Campbell, G R']","['Moran CS', 'Campbell JH', 'Campbell GR']","['Department of Anatomical Sciences, University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol,"Arteriosclerosis, thrombosis, and vascular biology",9505803,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lipoproteins, LDL)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Receptors, LDL)', '97C5T2UQ7J (Cholesterol)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Arteriosclerosis/pathology', 'Biological Transport', 'Cholesterol/*blood', 'Diet, Atherogenic', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lipoproteins, LDL/*metabolism', 'Liver/*metabolism', 'Lymphokines/*pharmacology', 'Male', 'Muscle, Smooth, Vascular/metabolism', 'Rabbits', 'Receptors, LDL/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Up-Regulation']",1997/07/01 00:00,1997/07/01 00:01,['1997/07/01 00:00'],"['1997/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1161/01.atv.17.7.1267 [doi]'],ppublish,Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol. 1997 Jul;17(7):1267-73. doi: 10.1161/01.atv.17.7.1267.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study we show that 25 microM C6-ceramide induced significant H2O2 production within 60 min, which increased up to 180 min in human myeloid leukemia U937 cells. Inactive analogue dihydro-C6-ceramide had no effect. Furthermore, no H2O2 production was observed in C6-ceramide-treated U937 rho degrees cells, which are mitochondrial respiration-deficient. We also present evidence that ceramide-induced activation of the transcription factors NF-kappaB and AP-1 is mediated by mitochondrial derived reactive oxygen species. Both H2O2 production, transcription factor activation as well as apoptosis could be inhibited by rotenone and thenoyltrifluoroacetone (specific mitochondrial complexes I and II inhibitors) and antioxidants, N-acetylcysteine and pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate. These effects could be potentiated by antimycin A (specific complex III mitochondrial inhibitor). H2O2 production was also inhibitable by ruthenium red, suggesting a role of mitochondrial calcium homeostasis alterations in ceramide-induced oxidative stress. Finally, C6-ceramide had no influence on mitochondrial membrane potential within the first 6 h. Altogether, our study points to reactive oxygen species, generated at the ubiquinone site of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, as an early major mediator in ceramide-induced apoptosis.","['Quillet-Mary, A', 'Jaffrezou, J P', 'Mansat, V', 'Bordier, C', 'Naval, J', 'Laurent, G']","['Quillet-Mary A', 'Jaffrezou JP', 'Mansat V', 'Bordier C', 'Naval J', 'Laurent G']","['CJF INSERM 9503, Centre Claudius Regaud, Toulouse Cedex, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Ceramides)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-1)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Antioxidants/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Ceramides/*pharmacology', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/*metabolism', 'Membrane Potentials', 'Mitochondria/*metabolism/physiology', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Transcription Factor AP-1/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/08/22 00:00,1997/08/22 00:01,['1997/08/22 00:00'],"['1997/08/22 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/08/22 00:01 [medline]', '1997/08/22 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.272.34.21388 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)65768-6 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1997 Aug 22;272(34):21388-95. doi: 10.1074/jbc.272.34.21388.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RFC1 has been proposed to be intrinsically equilibrating, generating transmembrane gradients by exchange with inorganic and organic anions. This paper defines the role of high level carrier expression, through transfection with RFC1 cDNA, on concentrative transport of the folate analog, methotrexate (MTX) in murine L1210 leukemia cells. RFC1 was expressed in the MTXrA line, which lacks a functional endogenous carrier to obtain the MTXrA-R16 clonal derivative. Influx was increased approximately 9-fold in MTXrA-R16 cells without a change in Km. The efflux rate constant was increased by a factor of 5.1 relative to L1210 cells, and this resulted in only a 2.1-fold increase in the steady-state level of free intracellular MTX, [MTX]i, when [MTX]e was 1 microM. The concentrative advantage for RFC1 (the ratio of [MTX]i in MTXrA-R16 to L1210 cells) increased from 1.8 at 0.1 microM MTX to 3.8 at an [MTX]e level of 30 microM. Augmented transport in MTXrA-R16 cells was accompanied by a 2-fold increase in accumulation of MTX polyglutamate derivatives and a approximately 50% decrease in the EC50 for 5-formyltetrahydrofolate and folic acid and the MTX IC50 relative to L1210 cells. These alterations paralleled changes in [MTX]i and not the much larger change in influx at low [MTX]e levels, consistent with the critical role that free intracellular folates and drug play in meeting cellular needs for folates and as a determinant of antifolate activity, respectively. The data indicate that RFC1 produces a large and near symmetrical increase in the bidirectional fluxes of MTX resulting in only a small increase in the transmembrane chemical gradient at low extracellular folate levels. Hence, increased expression of RFC1, alone, may not be an efficient adaptive response to folate deprivation, and other factors may come into play to account for the marked increases in concentrative folate transport which occur when cells are subjected to low folate-selective pressure.","['Zhao, R', 'Seither, R', 'Brigle, K E', 'Sharina, I G', 'Wang, P J', 'Goldman, I D']","['Zhao R', 'Seither R', 'Brigle KE', 'Sharina IG', 'Wang PJ', 'Goldman ID']","['Departments of Medicine, Molecular Pharmacology, and the Albert Einstein College of Medicine Cancer Center, Bronx, New York 10461, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Anions)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Formyltetrahydrofolates)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Transport Proteins)', '0 (Slc19a2 protein, mouse)', '25513-46-6 (Polyglutamic Acid)', '935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anions', 'Biological Transport', 'Carrier Proteins/*metabolism', 'Folic Acid/metabolism', 'Formyltetrahydrofolates/metabolism', 'Leukemia L1210', 'Membrane Potentials', 'Membrane Proteins/*metabolism', '*Membrane Transport Proteins', 'Methotrexate/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Polyglutamic Acid/metabolism']",1997/08/22 00:00,1997/08/22 00:01,['1997/08/22 00:00'],"['1997/08/22 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/08/22 00:01 [medline]', '1997/08/22 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.272.34.21207 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)65743-1 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1997 Aug 22;272(34):21207-12. doi: 10.1074/jbc.272.34.21207.,,,['CA-39807/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

UCN-01 exhibits antitumor activity in experimental tumor models and is presently in clinical trials. Our study reveals that human myeloblastic leukemia HL60 and K562 and colon carcinoma HT29 cells undergo internucleosomal DNA fragmentation and morphological changes characteristic of apoptosis after UCN-01 treatment. These three cell lines lack functional p53, and K562 and HT29 cells are usually resistant to apoptosis. DNA fragmentation in HT29 and K562 cells occurred after 1 day of treatment while it took less than 4 h in HL60 cells. Cycloheximide prevented UCN-01-induced DNA fragmentation in HT-29 cells, but not in HL60 and K562 cells, suggesting that macromolecular synthesis is selectively required for apoptotic DNA fragmentation in HT29 cells. UCN-01-induced DNA fragmentation was preceded by activation of cyclin B1/cdc2 kinase. Further studies in HL60 cells showed that UCN-01-induced apoptosis was associated with degradation of CPP32, PARP, and lamin B and that the inhibitor of caspases (ICE/CED-3 cysteine proteases), Z-VAD-FMK, and the serine protease inhibitor, DCI, protected HL60 cells from UCN-01-induced DNA fragmentation. However, only DCI and TPCK, but not Z-VAD-FMK, inhibited DNA fragmentation in the HL60 cell-free system, suggesting that serine protease(s) may play a role in the execution phase of apoptosis in HL60 cells treated with UCN-01. Z-VAD-FMK and DCI also inhibited apoptosis in HT29 cells. These data demonstrate that the protein kinase C inhibitor and antitumor agent, UCN-01 is a potent apoptosis inducer in cell lines that are usually resistant to apoptosis and lack p53 and that caspases and probably serine proteases are activated during UCN-01-induced apoptosis.","['Shao, R G', 'Shimizu, T', 'Pommier, Y']","['Shao RG', 'Shimizu T', 'Pommier Y']","['Laboratory of Molecular Pharmacology, Division of Basic Science, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (Alkaloids)', '0 (CCNB1 protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin B)', '0 (Cyclin B1)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Lamin Type B)', '0 (Lamins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Protein Synthesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Serine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (lamin B1)', '7BU5H4V94A (7-hydroxystaurosporine)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDC2 Protein Kinase)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)']",IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/metabolism/pathology', 'Alkaloids/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'CDC2 Protein Kinase/metabolism', 'Caspase 3', '*Caspases', 'Colonic Neoplasms/metabolism/*pathology', '*Cyclin B', 'Cyclin B1', 'Cyclins/metabolism', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/metabolism', 'Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'HT29 Cells', 'Humans', 'Lamin Type B', 'Lamins', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism/*pathology', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase C/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Protein Synthesis Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Serine Proteinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Staurosporine/analogs & derivatives', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*physiology']",1997/08/01 00:00,1997/08/01 00:01,['1997/08/01 00:00'],"['1997/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0014-4827(97)93650-8 [pii]', '10.1006/excr.1997.3650 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 1997 Aug 1;234(2):388-97. doi: 10.1006/excr.1997.3650.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Immunoblot analysis revealed that ERK1 and ERK2 are the predominant ERK isoforms present in HL-60 cells and that over a 96-h period ERK1 protein was gradually reduced by 60% while ERK2 protein showed only a small, insignificant reduction. Therefore, the large, rapid decrease in total ERK activity could not be attributed to the gradual reductions in ERK1 or ERK2 amounts. Immunoblot analysis with two different phosphotyrosine antibodies revealed a rapid decrease in ERK1 phosphotyrosine and a concurrent transient increase in ERK2 phosphotyrosine. These contrasting changes in phosphorylated ERKs were paralleled by respective shifts in mobility during SDS-PAGE analysis. Together these results indicate that the rapid reduction in total ERK activity is due to rapid tyrosine and possible threonine dephosphorylation of ERK1 but not of ERK2.

An RAR- or just RAR alpha-selective analog alone induced similar cell population growth arrest, cell cycle arrest without restriction to G1, hypophosphorylation of RB, and myelomonocytic cell surface differentiation marker expression (CD11b). In addition, an RAR alpha antagonist could inhibit the effects of the RAR alpha agonist completely. The RAR alpha-selective analog-elicited response was attenuated by simultaneous addition of various RXR-selective analogs. In contrast, each of the RXR-selective analogs was unable to induce any of the cellular responses analyzed. The growth arrest of NB4 cells is not G1-restricted and occurs at all points in the cell cycle. Cells growth arrested by treatment with an RAR alpha-selective analog show primarily hypophosphorylated RB. When these cells are sorted into G1 or S + G2/M subpopulations by flow cytometry, hypophosphorylated RB protein was in G1 as well as S + G2/M cells. This suggests that the hypophosphorylated RB protein may be mediating the growth arrest of NB4 cells at all points in the cell cycle. These results are consistent with an involvement of PML-RAR alpha and/or RAR alpha in the transduction of the retinoid signal in NB4 cells.","['Brooks, S C 3rd', 'Sturgill, R', 'Choi, J', 'Yen, A']","['Brooks SC 3rd', 'Sturgill R', 'Choi J', 'Yen A']","['Department of Pathology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York 14853, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (Macrophage-1 Antigen)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RARA protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '0 (Retinoid X Receptors)', '0 (Retinoids)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)']",IM,"['Cell Cycle/*drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/metabolism/*pathology', 'Macrophage-1 Antigen/analysis', 'Neoplasm Proteins', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion', 'Phosphorylation', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/*agonists/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/metabolism', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha', 'Retinoid X Receptors', 'Retinoids/*pharmacology', 'Transcription Factors/*agonists', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/08/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1997/08/01 00:00'],"['1997/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1997/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S001448279793620X [pii]', '10.1006/excr.1997.3620 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 1997 Aug 1;234(2):259-69. doi: 10.1006/excr.1997.3620.,,,['ES 07052/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One to three diagnostic markers were selected from each case, yielding 124 paired results for comparison. We found that the percentage of tumor cell isolation and the total cell count in the tumor cell gate were higher in RALS/CD45 than in FALS/RALS. When 20% was used as a cutoff point, 30 markers in FALS/RALS failed to identify the tumor population, while only 3 markers in RALS/CD45 failed to do so. The discriminative factor in the RALS/CD45 gating was mainly the CD45 intensity, whereas all cases except 3 showed low RALS. Although T-cell neoplasms showed a higher proportion of high CD45 intensity, other groups shared similar ranges of CD45 intensity, which is therefore of limited value for differential diagnosis. The RALS/CD45 combination produces higher recovery and purity for tumor cell isolation than the FALS/RALS combination and should replace the latter for routine immunophenotyping of lymphoma and leukemia.","['Sun, T', 'Sangaline, R', 'Ryder, J', 'Gibbens, K', 'Rollo, C', 'Stewart, S', 'Rajagopalan, C']","['Sun T', 'Sangaline R', 'Ryder J', 'Gibbens K', 'Rollo C', 'Stewart S', 'Rajagopalan C']","['Veterans Affairs Medical Center, and the Department of Pathology, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Denver 80220, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Am J Clin Pathol,American journal of clinical pathology,0370470,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping/*methods', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/pathology', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens/analysis', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Lymphocytes/pathology', 'Lymphoma/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/pathology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/pathology']",1997/08/01 00:00,1997/08/01 00:01,['1997/08/01 00:00'],"['1997/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/ajcp/108.2.152 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Clin Pathol. 1997 Aug;108(2):152-7. doi: 10.1093/ajcp/108.2.152.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These abnormalities are numerical, structural or both numerical and structural. They are also classified in ""primary"" abnormalities, usually more or less related with one subtype of leukaemia, and ""secondary"" abnormalities thought to appear in a second time. Chromosome abnormalities of childhood acute myeloblastic leukaemia (AML) are not basically qualitatively different from those of adult AML. The main difference lies in the incidence of the various types of abnormalities, and these differences appear to be more marked for age extremes such as infants and elderly patients. In total, 3 common abnormalities are more frequently observed in childhood than in adult AML; t(8;21) in AML-M2, monosomy 7 in AML-M4, der(11q) in AML-M5. In addition, molecular rearrangements associated with chromosomal abnormalities are dependent on the type of rearrangement and not on age. As in adult AML, the prognostic value of chromosome abnormalities has been diversely evaluated; some anomalies seem to be related to a shorter survival than others independent of the various therapeutic protocols used. In the present work, chromosome abnormalities of childhood AML have been reviewed according to cytologic subtypes as well as to some clinical settings.

This study evaluated the reliability and validity of two questionnaires: the Childhood Cancer Stressors Inventory (CCSI) and the Children's Adjustment to Cancer Index (CACI). The following steps were involved in the instrument development process: item development, face and content validation, internal consistency reliability, and construct validity. Questions for both instruments were developed from the literature and experience of the principal investigator. A panel of five expert pediatric oncology nurses was asked to evaluate the content validity of both instruments. All the experts rated every item a 4-5 using the content validity index, indicating that each item measured the concept addressed by the scale. Seventy-five children with cancer were asked to complete the two questionnaires and parents completed a demographic data sheet that included eight questions about the child's school attendance, performance, number of friends, and activities. Children were 7 to 13 years of age; 64% were diagnosed with a leukemia/ lymphoma, and 36% had a solid tumor. Internal coefficient reliability for the total CCSI was .82, and .91 for the CACI. The CCSI correlated negatively with the adjustment scale (r = -.63, P = 000). The number of days missed from school correlated positively with the CCSI and negatively with the CACI. Children who missed more school perceived more cancer stressors and had a lower adjustment rating. Children with lower adjustment ratings on the CACI also had fewer friends (t = 3.4(72), P = .001). Scores on both instruments demonstrated expected relationships with measures hypothesized to covary with the dimensions assessed by the new instruments. Adjustment issues for children with cancer have been difficult to assess because of the lack of appropriate instruments. These study findings indicate that the two new instruments can help to measure the child's perceptions of the cancer experience.","['Hockenberry-Eaton, M', 'Manteuffel, B', 'Bottomley, S']","['Hockenberry-Eaton M', 'Manteuffel B', 'Bottomley S']","['Department of Pediatrics, Baylor University, Houston, TX, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Pediatr Oncol Nurs,Journal of pediatric oncology nursing : official journal of the Association of Pediatric Oncology Nurses,8917825,,IM,"['*Adaptation, Psychological', 'Adolescent', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*psychology', 'Nursing Assessment/*standards', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Stress, Psychological/*diagnosis/etiology/nursing', 'Surveys and Questionnaires/*standards']",1997/07/01 00:00,1997/07/01 00:01,['1997/07/01 00:00'],"['1997/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S1043-4542(97)90054-0 [pii]', '10.1016/s1043-4542(97)90054-0 [doi]']",ppublish,J Pediatr Oncol Nurs. 1997 Jul;14(3):178-85. doi: 10.1016/s1043-4542(97)90054-0.,,,,['J Pediatr Oncol Nurs. 1997 Oct;14(4):193.

Numerous studies addressed the role of the multidrug resistant phenotype and, at least in adult disease, demonstrated that the presence of this particular phenotype was a poor prognostic indicator. In the pediatric population, the significance of multidrug resistance expression appeared less clear. Discrepancies between protein expression and function were also evaluated in clinical samples and outcomes reported in large clinical series. Among the most interesting scientific investigations were those focused on the molecular mechanisms involved in the specific translocations t(15;17) and t(8;21) in acute myelogenous leukemia and t(12;21) in acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

DESIGN: A retrospective descriptive study which calculated incidence and frequency rates from the data obtained from a 6-year survey of childhood cancer in Namibia. SETTING: Children from the general community who were referred by primary care physicians or clinics and diagnosed in peripheral district hospitals or a tertiary care institution. PATIENTS: A total of 163 children less than 15 years of age diagnosed with any malignant neoplasm, intracranial tumour or histiocytosis between 1983 and 1988. INTERVENTION: None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The minimum overall incidence of childhood cancer recorded in Namibia was lower than the rates usually reported by economically privileged countries. The rates of certain malignancies corresponded to the rates recorded in other African countries. RESULTS: The overall incidence of childhood cancer was 55.5 per million. Tumours of the central nervous system occurred most commonly (18%), followed by renal tumours (14%), leukaemia (12%) and lymphoma (11.5%). The 5.8 per million incidence rate of retinoblastoma was similar to the rates recorded in other African countries but higher than in the UK or the USA. The incidence rates per million children for renal tumours, malignant bone tumours and soft-tissue sarcomas were 7.4, 4.8 and 5.2, respectively, which correspond with the rates in Western Europe and the USA. The incidence rate of CNS tumours was only 9.3 per million. Both leukaemia (6.5 per million) and lymphoma (6.3 per million) had rates far lower than those recorded in central Africa or developed Western countries. CONCLUSION: The incidence pattern of childhood cancer in Namibia demonstrates features of both the patterns described as typical for Africa and those described for industrialised countries.","['Wessels, G', 'Hesseling, P B']","['Wessels G', 'Hesseling PB']","['Department of Paediatrics and Child Health, University of Stellenbosch, Tygerberg, W Cape.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",South Africa,S Afr Med J,South African medical journal = Suid-Afrikaanse tydskrif vir geneeskunde,0404520,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'England/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Namibia/epidemiology', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Nigeria/epidemiology', 'Prevalence', 'Registries', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Uganda/epidemiology', 'United States/epidemiology', 'Zimbabwe/epidemiology']",1997/07/01 00:00,1997/07/01 00:01,['1997/07/01 00:00'],"['1997/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,S Afr Med J. 1997 Jul;87(7):885-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although it is presumed that allogeneic T cells mediate this graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect, the influence of DLI on the T cell compartment of recipients has not been determined. To characterize the immunologic effects of DLI and to identify T cell changes selectively associated with the GVL response, we analyzed the T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire in four patients with relapsed chronic myelocytic leukemia who achieved a complete remission after infusion of CD4+ lymphocytes from HLA-identical sibling donors. Only one of the four patients developed clinically significant graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) after infusion of donor lymphocytes. TCR repertoire was examined after PCR amplification of 24 Vbeta gene subfamilies in serial samples obtained over a 1-yr period before and after DLI. Results were compared to 10 normal donors. Before DLI, all four patients were found to have abnormal TCR Vbeta repertoire in peripheral T cells, associated with a large number of clonal and oligoclonal patterns. Abnormal TCR patterns persisted for at least 3 mo after DLI, but thereafter gradually began to normalize. By 1 yr after DLI, all patients demonstrated almost complete normalization of Vbeta repertoire with polyclonal representation within almost all Vbeta gene subfamilies. We also examined changes in the TCR Vbeta repertoire associated with the disappearance of Ph+ cells. In each patient, we were able to identify the expansion of at least 1 Vbeta gene subfamily that coincided with the time of the cytogenetic response. In one patient who was studied in greater detail, CDR3 size analysis of serial samples after DLI indicated that these changes were associated with the appearance of clonal T cells. This finding was confirmed through CDR3 sequence analysis and use of CDR3 clone-specific oligonucleotide probes. A putative GVL clone identified by this technique was not detectable in either donor or patient T cells before DLI, but persisted in peripheral T cells for approximately 1 yr. These experiments therefore provide evidence for the clonal expansion of allogeneic T cells that may be selective mediators of antileukemia activity without also mediating graft-versus-host disease.","['Claret, E J', 'Alyea, E P', 'Orsini, E', 'Pickett, C C', 'Collins, H', 'Wang, Y', 'Neuberg, D', 'Soiffer, R J', 'Ritz, J']","['Claret EJ', 'Alyea EP', 'Orsini E', 'Pickett CC', 'Collins H', 'Wang Y', 'Neuberg D', 'Soiffer RJ', 'Ritz J']","['Division of Hematologic Malignancies, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",IM,"['Adult', 'CD3 Complex/genetics', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology/*transplantation', 'Clone Cells/immunology', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Reaction/immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/immunology/*therapy', '*Lymphocyte Transfusion', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/analysis', 'T-Lymphocytes/*classification', 'Time Factors']",1997/08/15 00:00,1997/08/15 00:01,['1997/08/15 00:00'],"['1997/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1997/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1172/JCI119601 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Invest. 1997 Aug 15;100(4):855-66. doi: 10.1172/JCI119601.,,,['AI29530/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,PMC508258,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using the 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA)-induced rat leukemia system, we examined whether WT1 expression was involved during leukemogenesis, since this model enabled us to analyze cells altered by DMBA at various stages of leukemogenesis. By the semi-quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method, WT1 expression was detected in 15 (71%) of 21 DMBA-induced erythroblastic leukemias. Among 15 WT1-expressing leukemias, GATA-1, which is an erythroid-specific transcription factor and might regulate WT1 expression, was also expressed in 13 cases (p < 0.05). On the other hand, WT1 expression was not detected in any normal or early pre-leukemic rats and was detected in 1 of 8 rats in late pre-leukemic stages. These results showed that cells with a high expression level of WT1 tended to develop into leukemia and that WT1 contributed to leukemogenesis in the late stage, suggesting that the expression of WT1 plays an important role in cell proliferation and in maintaining the viability of some leukemia cells.","['Osaka, M', 'Koami, K', 'Sugiyama, T']","['Osaka M', 'Koami K', 'Sugiyama T']","['Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Kyoto University, Japan. osaka@med.kyoto-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors)', '0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Gata1 protein, rat)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)', '57-97-6 (9,10-Dimethyl-1,2-benzanthracene)']",IM,"['9,10-Dimethyl-1,2-benzanthracene/*toxicity', 'Animals', 'Carcinogens/*toxicity', '*Cocarcinogenesis', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors', 'Female', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/physiology', 'Genes, Wilms Tumor/*drug effects', 'Genes, ras', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*chemically induced/*genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mutation', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred Strains', 'Transcription Factors/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'WT1 Proteins']",1997/08/07 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1997/08/07 00:00'],"['1997/08/07 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1997/08/07 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0215(19970807)72:4<696::AID-IJC23>3.0.CO;2-8 [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1097-0215(19970807)72:4<696::aid-ijc23>3.0.co;2-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1997 Aug 7;72(4):696-9. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1097-0215(19970807)72:4<696::aid-ijc23>3.0.co;2-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Carcinoma cells constitutively express LIF mRNA, and 23 lines (92.0%) and all (100%) of 25 lines express LIF receptor mRNAs of LIFRbeta and gp130, respectively. Exogenous addition of LIF promoted significant cell proliferation in 4 lines (MCF-7, ZR-75-1, Hs-700T and Panc-1) and suppressed cell growth in 3 lines (AZ-521, GBK-1 and HT-29). LIF significantly induced an immediate early response of genes c-fos and junB 3 hr after stimulation, but not of c-jun during the process of proliferation of MCF-7 and Hs-700T cells, with maximum levels at 30-60 min. The cell-cycle-related gene cyclin E was also induced in MCF-7 and Hs-700T cells, whereas cyclinA, cdk2, c-myc, c-myb and p53 mRNAs were not induced. On the other hand, LIF inhibited growth and increased the rate of cell death of AZ-521 and GBK-1 cells. LIF increased the number of TUNEL-positive cells in AZ-521 cells and DNA fragmentation in AZ-521 and GBK-1 cells. LIF induced apoptosis related genes c-myc and ICE during suppression of cell growth, but p53, p21, c-fos, cyclin A and cyclin E were not induced. Our results suggest that LIF is linked to cell proliferation and apoptosis in some human carcinoma cell lines. It is considered that this is related to differences in signal transduction and induction of oncogenes.","['Kamohara, H', 'Sakamoto, K', 'Ishiko, T', 'Masuda, Y', 'Abe, T', 'Ogawa, M']","['Kamohara H', 'Sakamoto K', 'Ishiko T', 'Masuda Y', 'Abe T', 'Ogawa M']","['Department of Surgery II, Kumamoto University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (LIFR protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Carcinoma/*drug therapy/genetics/*pathology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cyclins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Growth Inhibitors/biosynthesis/*pharmacology', 'Humans', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit', 'Lymphokines/biosynthesis/*pharmacology', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/genetics/*pathology', 'Oncogenes/*drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun/biosynthesis/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Receptors, Cytokine/biosynthesis', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/08/07 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1997/08/07 00:00'],"['1997/08/07 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1997/08/07 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0215(19970807)72:4<687::AID-IJC22>3.0.CO;2-7 [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1097-0215(19970807)72:4<687::aid-ijc22>3.0.co;2-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1997 Aug 7;72(4):687-95. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1097-0215(19970807)72:4<687::aid-ijc22>3.0.co;2-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Integrated proviral human T-lymphotrophic virus type I (HTLV-I) has been demonstrated in such lesions. We studied 18 patients with this disease, and about half of the cases developed typical ATLL within 2 or 3 years. In all cases, either mono- or oligoclonal cell populations with proviral HTLV-I DNA were detected by Southern blot analysis and/or inverse polymerase chain reaction (IPCR). In addition, either a mono- or oligoclonal rearrangement of T-cell receptor genes was demonstrated. Giant cells with Reed-Sternberg-like histological features revealed CD15 and CD30 positivity. The background infiltrating lymphocytes represented either no or only minimal nuclear abnormalities with a CD4+ T-cell phenotype. In less than half of all cases, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infected the giant cells. A mixed EBV-A and -B type was found in 3, and a multiple genotype of EBV lymphocyte-determined membrane antigen (LYDMA) was found in 6 cases. These results could have been due to the immunodeficient status of the patients. A single-cell PCR of the giant cell, B cell, CD4+ or CD8+ T cells could be performed after cell sorting in 4 cases. HTLV-I infection was frequently found in the CD4+ T cells, but in neither the giant cells nor the B cells. The CD4+ T cells exhibited clonality. The giant cells showed various PCR products of IgH, and also expressed recombination activating genes (RAG). In summary, the giant cells were reactive cells, which resembled the immature B-lineage cells, while HTLV-I infected the CD4+ T cells, which demonstrated clonality. Based on these above findings, we consider CD4+ cells to play an important role in ATLL tumorigenesis.","['Ohshima, K', 'Suzumiya, J', 'Kato, A', 'Tashiro, K', 'Kikuchi, M']","['Ohshima K', 'Suzumiya J', 'Kato A', 'Tashiro K', 'Kikuchi M']","['Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, Fukuoka University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (RAG2 protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (V(D)J recombination activating protein 2)', '128559-51-3 (RAG-1 protein)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Blotting, Southern', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*pathology/*virology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Clone Cells', 'DNA, Viral/analysis', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Genome, Viral', 'Genotype', 'Giant Cells/*pathology/*virology', 'HTLV-I Infections/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/genetics', 'Hodgkin Disease/*pathology', '*Homeodomain Proteins', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/genetics/*pathology/*virology', 'Lymph Nodes/pathology/virology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nuclear Proteins', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/genetics']",1997/08/07 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1997/08/07 00:00'],"['1997/08/07 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1997/08/07 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0215(19970807)72:4<592::AID-IJC7>3.0.CO;2-L [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1097-0215(19970807)72:4<592::aid-ijc7>3.0.co;2-l [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1997 Aug 7;72(4):592-8. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1097-0215(19970807)72:4<592::aid-ijc7>3.0.co;2-l.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To date, the precise role of individual integrin molecules in bone cell-ECM interactions remains unclear. Cell binding assays were performed to examine the ability of normal human bone cells (NHBCs) to adhere to different ECM proteins in vitro. NHBCs displayed preferential adhesion to fibronectin over collagen types I, IV, and vitronectin and showed low affinity binding to laminin and collagen type V. No binding was observed to collagen type III. The integrin heterodimers alpha 1 beta 1, alpha 2 beta 1, alpha 3 beta 1, alpha 5 beta 1, alpha v beta 3, and alpha v beta 5 were found to be constitutively expressed on the cell surface of NHBCs by flow cytometric analysis. The integrins alpha 4 beta 1 and alpha 6 beta 1 were not expressed by NHBCs. Subsequent binding studies showed that NHBC adhesion to collagen and laminin was mediated by multiple integrins where cell attachment was almost completely inhibited in the presence of a combination of function-blocking monoclonal antibodies (Mabs) to alpha 1 beta 1, alpha 2 beta 1, alpha 3 beta 1, and beta 1. In contrast, the adhesion of NHBCs to fibronectin was only partially inhibited (50%) in the presence of blocking Mabs to alpha 3 beta 1, alpha 5 beta 1, and beta 1. The attachment of NHBCs to collagen, laminin, fibronectin, and vitronectin was also found to be unaffected in the presence of a function-blocking Mab to alpha v beta 3.

A few studies have indicated that exposure to gasoline is a cause of childhood leukemia. The purpose of this study was to investigate if environmental exposure to benzene from gasoline and car exhaust was associated with leukemia in children and young adults. The exposure to gasoline and car exhaust was estimated by the number of cars per area. In this ecology study, data on the incidence of cancer in each municipality of Sweden during an 11-year period (1975-1985) were compared with the number of cars per area. Data on the incidence of cancer for persons aged 0-24 years at diagnosis were collected from the National Swedish Cancer Register. The following diagnoses were studied: non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We found an association between AML and car density. In municipalities with more than 20 cars/km2 the incidence of AML was 5.5 [95% confidence interval (CI) 4.4-6.8, n = 89] as compared with 3.4 (95% CI 1.9-5.7, n = 15) cases per 1 million person-years in municipalities with less than 5 cars/km2 (P = 0.05). No association was found for the other sites of cancer studied. The association between AML in young adults and car density might be attributable to exposure to benzene from gasoline vapors and exhaust gases, but further investigations are necessary before any definite conclusion can be drawn.","['Nordlinder, R', 'Jarvholm, B']","['Nordlinder R', 'Jarvholm B']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Goteborg University, Sweden. rolf.nordlinder@medicine.gu.se']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Int Arch Occup Environ Health,International archives of occupational and environmental health,7512134,"['0 (Gasoline)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Automobiles', 'Benzene/adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Environmental Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Gasoline/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/epidemiology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/epidemiology', 'Sweden/epidemiology']",1997/01/01 00:00,1997/01/01 00:01,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s004200050186 [doi]'],ppublish,Int Arch Occup Environ Health. 1997;70(1):57-60. doi: 10.1007/s004200050186.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CGH and karyotyping both revealed copy number changes in 12 of the 25 CLL cases (48%) analyzed. Loss at 11q emerged as the most common aberration (6 cases), followed by a gain of chromosome 12 (4) and loss at 13q (3). Concordance between CGH and G-banding was found in 23 of the 25 cases (92%), which is more than reported in a recent similar CGH study of CLL.

The occurrence of microsatellite instability (MSI) was also tasted in selected cases. Samples of PV and ET analyzed in chronic phase disease were consistently devoid of all genetic lesions tested, suggesting that alterations of TP53, NRAS, KRAS, and MDM2 do not contribute significantly to development of chronic phase PV and ET. Conversely, mutations of TP53 were detected in 7/15 (46.6%) blastic phase cases, including 3/5 PV and 4/10 ET. In blastic phase patients for whom the corresponding chronic phase DNA was also available, it could be documented that the genetic lesion had arisen at the time of blastic transformation. In addition to TP53 mutations, cases of blastic phase PV and ET occasionally harbored mutations of NRAS (one case of blastic phase ET) or displayed MSI (one case of blastic phase PV). These data indicate that inactivation of TP53 is a relatively frequent event associated with the blastic transformation of PV and ET and may be responsible for the tumor progression of these disorders.","['Gaidano, G', 'Pastore, C', 'Santini, V', 'Nomdedeu, J', 'Gamberi, B', 'Capello, D', 'Vischia, F', 'Resegotti, L', 'Mazza, U', 'Ferrini, P R', 'Lo Coco, F', 'Saglio, G']","['Gaidano G', 'Pastore C', 'Santini V', 'Nomdedeu J', 'Gamberi B', 'Capello D', 'Vischia F', 'Resegotti L', 'Mazza U', 'Ferrini PR', 'Lo Coco F', 'Saglio G']","['Dipartimento di Scienze Biomediche e Oncologia Umana, Universita di Torino, Ospedale San Luigi, Orbassano, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (MDM2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Blast Crisis/*genetics', 'Blotting, Southern', 'DNA/isolation & purification', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA Probes', 'DNA, Neoplasm/isolation & purification', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Genes, p53/genetics', 'Genes, ras/genetics', 'Humans', 'Lymphocyte Activation/genetics', 'Male', 'Microsatellite Repeats', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Polycythemia Vera/*genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Thrombocythemia, Essential/*genetics/immunology/pathology']",1997/08/01 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1997/08/01 00:00'],"['1997/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1997/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/(SICI)1098-2264(199708)19:4<250::AID-GCC7>3.0.CO;2-W [pii]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 1997 Aug;19(4):250-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The transcription factor encoded by this gene has a dual function in oncogenesis because it regulates genes that prevent apoptosis and genes involved in cellular proliferation. c-myb has repeatedly been a target of retroviral insertional mutagenesis. The most common mechanism by which retroviruses activate c-myb's oncogenic potential is by providing transcriptional control that results in constitutive expression, a feature that is consistent with the demonstration that ectopic expression of c-myb can prevent growth arrest of differentiating hematopoietic cells. In a less common mechanism of activation, carboxyl(C)-terminal truncation renders the c-Myb protein more stable and active in transcriptional transactivation. Interestingly, the ability of v-Myb, a product of the avian myeloblastosis virus (AMV), to cause rapid transformation of cells in vivo and in vitro can be explained by the combined effects of deregulated expression through the retroviral LTR, N- and C-terminal truncation, and activating mutations in its DNA binding domain.

The complex, named Bamet-R2, was characterized by spectroscopy and elemental analysis. Results obtained in these studies together with conductivity measurements, which pointed to nonelectrolyte behavior, allowed the structure of the complex to be identified as C26H48N3O6ClPt. The compound was found to be soluble (up to 3 mM) in water and was highly soluble (more than 10 mM) in ethanol, methanol, and dimethyl sulfoxide. Its stability in solution was monitored by HPLC analysis. In deionized water, the compound remains > 90% pure in solution for up to 7 days and > 80% for up to 28 days. However, in 150 mM NaCl it remains as > 90% pure compound in solution for only 1 day. By contrast with the parent compound CG, Bamet-R2 was found to significantly inhibit the growth of rat hepatocytes in primary culture and L1210 murine leukemia cells, although in a less marked way than that observed for cisplatin. The cytostatic effect of Bamet-R2 was particularly strong against human colon adenocarcinoma LS174T cells. The results point to the potential usefulness of Bamet-R2 in the antitumoral therapy of enterohepatic-derived neoplasias.","['Criado, J J', 'Macias, R I', 'Medarde, M', 'Monte, M J', 'Serrano, M A', 'Marin, J J']","['Criado JJ', 'Macias RI', 'Medarde M', 'Monte MJ', 'Serrano MA', 'Marin JJ']","['Department of Inorganic Chemistry, University of Salamanca, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Bioconjug Chem,Bioconjugate chemistry,9010319,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Organoplatinum Compounds)', '0 (diaminneplatinum(II)-chlorocholylglycinate)', 'G59NX3I3RT (Glycocholic Acid)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cisplatin/*analogs & derivatives/chemical synthesis/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Drug Stability', 'Glycocholic Acid/*analogs & derivatives/chemical synthesis/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia L1210/pathology', 'Liver/cytology/drug effects', 'Mice', '*Organoplatinum Compounds', 'Rats', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/07/01 00:00,1997/07/01 00:01,['1997/07/01 00:00'],"['1997/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1021/bc970061v [doi]', 'bc970061v [pii]']",ppublish,Bioconjug Chem. 1997 Jul-Aug;8(4):453-8. doi: 10.1021/bc970061v.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A series of analogues of the known 1'-NHhexyl lead compound were prepared and evaluated against L. major in macrophage culture to further develop structure-activity relationships (SAR). Toxicity toward mammalian cells was measured in a human leukemia cell line, and the ratio of the two IC50 values (IC50(J)/IC50(L)) was used as a measure of the in vitro therapeutic index (IVTI). A 3,6-diNMe2 substitution pattern on the acridine greatly increased toxicity to L. major without altering mammalian toxicity, increasing IVTIs over that of the lead compound. The 2-OMe, 6-Cl acridine substitution pattern used in the antimalarial drug mepacrine also resulted in potent antileishmanial activity and high IVTIs. Earlier suggestions of the utility of 2'-OR groups in lowering mammalian cytotoxicity were not borne out in this wider study. A series of very lipophilic 1'-NRR (symmetric dialkylamino)-substituted analogues showed relatively high antileishmanial potency, but no clear trend was apparent across the series, and none were superior to the 1'-NH(CH2)5Me subclass. Subsets of the most active 1'-N(R)(CH2)5Me- and 1'-N(alkyl)2-substituted compounds against L. major were also evaluated against Leishmania donovani, Trypanosoma cruzi, and Trypanosoma brucei, but no consistent SAR could be discerned in these physiologically diverse test systems. The present study has confirmed earlier conclusions that lipophilic electron-donating groups at the 1'-position of 9-anilinoacridines provide high activity against L. major, but the SAR patterns observed do not carry over to the other parasites studied.","['Gamage, S A', 'Figgitt, D P', 'Wojcik, S J', 'Ralph, R K', 'Ransijn, A', 'Mauel, J', 'Yardley, V', 'Snowdon, D', 'Croft, S L', 'Denny, W A']","['Gamage SA', 'Figgitt DP', 'Wojcik SJ', 'Ralph RK', 'Ransijn A', 'Mauel J', 'Yardley V', 'Snowdon D', 'Croft SL', 'Denny WA']","['Cancer Research Laboratory, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, University of Auckland, New Zealand.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry,9716531,"['0 (Antiprotozoal Agents)', '0 (Trypanocidal Agents)', '00DPD30SOY (Amsacrine)', '3340-22-5 (9-anilinoacridine)']",IM,"['Amsacrine/*analogs & derivatives/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antiprotozoal Agents/*chemistry/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leishmania donovani/drug effects', 'Leishmania major/drug effects', 'Macrophages/parasitology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred CBA', 'Models, Chemical', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Trypanocidal Agents/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Trypanosoma brucei brucei/drug effects', 'Trypanosoma cruzi/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/08/01 00:00,1997/08/01 00:01,['1997/08/01 00:00'],"['1997/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1021/jm970232h [doi]', 'jm970232h [pii]']",ppublish,J Med Chem. 1997 Aug 1;40(16):2634-42. doi: 10.1021/jm970232h.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This finding prompted us to synthesize its hydrolysis-resistant methylenebis(phosphonate) and difluoromethylenebis(phosphonate) analogues 8 and 9, respectively. Since both TAD and benzamide adenine dinucleotide (BAD) are potent inhibitors of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH), the corresponding fluorine-substituted methylenebis(phosphonate) analogue 12 of BAD was also synthesized. Thus, 9-(2-deoxy-2-fluoro-beta-D-arabinofuranosyl)adenine (13) was converted in five steps into the corresponding methylenebis(phosphonate) analogue 18. Dehydration of 18 with DCC led to the formation of the bicyclic trisanhydride intermediate 19a, which upon reaction with 2',3'-O-isopropylidenetiazofurin (20) or -benzamide riboside (21) followed by hydrolysis and deprotection afforded the desired methylene-bridged dinucleotides 8 and 12, respectively. The similar displacement of the 5'-mesyl function of 2',3'-O-isopropylidene-5'-O-mesyltiazofurin (24) with the difluoromethylenebis(phosphonic acid) derivative gave the phosphonate 25 which was coupled with 13 to afford 26. The desired difluoromethylenebis(phosphonate) analogue 9 was obtained by deprotection with Dowex 50/H+.

Recently, Mo-MuLV has been shown to trans-activate cellular genes. Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) is a chemokine which can promote the migration and diapedesis of monocytes and lymphocytes, as well as inducing metastasis of lymphomas. Here we demonstrate that introduction of Mo-MuLV or the MuLV LTR alone, transiently or stably, into Balb/c-3T3 cells or HeLa cells resulted in 9-11 fold increases in MCP-1 transcripts. This trans-activation of the MCP-1 gene by the Mo-MuLV LTR is independent of the physical location of the MCP-1 gene or of the LTR, occurring whether the LTR or the MCP-1 gene is integrated in the genome or transiently expressed. Immunoblot analysis using an anti-MCP-1 polyclonal antibody showed that the expression of the MuLV LTR in HeLa cells also induced the appearance of the MCP-1 protein. Boyden Chamber analysis demonstrated that the MCP-1 chemotactic activity produced by HeLa cells with an integrated MuLV LTR was elevated by 11 fold and that neutralizing antibody to human MCP-1 abrogated monocyte migration in response to MuLV LTR expression. Promoter deletional analysis showed the LTR responsive cis-acting element in the MCP-1 promoter is located between -141 and -88. Deletion of this region abolished the trans-activation of MCP-1 by the LTR. These LTR-mediated activations of a chemotactic and inflammatory cytokine may be relevant as mechanisms whereby retroviruses which do not contain oncogenes can induce neoplasia.","['Faller, D V', 'Weng, H', 'Graves, D T', 'Choi, S Y']","['Faller DV', 'Weng H', 'Graves DT', 'Choi SY']","['Cancer Research Center, Boston University School of Medicine, Massachusetts 02118, USA. dfaller@bu.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Chemokine CCL2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Chemokine CCL2/genetics/*metabolism', '*Chemotaxis, Leukocyte', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid/*physiology', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/08/01 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1997/08/01 00:00'],"['1997/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1997/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-4652(199708)172:2<240::AID-JCP11>3.0.CO;2-D [pii]', '10.1002/(SICI)1097-4652(199708)172:2<240::AID-JCP11>3.0.CO;2-D [doi]']",ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 1997 Aug;172(2):240-52. doi: 10.1002/(SICI)1097-4652(199708)172:2<240::AID-JCP11>3.0.CO;2-D.,,,['CA-65420/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The LOX pathway may also be critical in regulating tumor cell survival and apoptosis. Blocking the 12-LOX gene expression with sequence-specific antisense oligos or its activity with general or isoform-specific LOX inhibitors induces a strong apoptotic response in rat W256 carcinosarcoma cells of the monocytoid origin (Tang et al., 1996, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 93:5241-5246). In the present study, several molecular approaches confirmed the predominant expression of platelet-type 12-LOX in W256 cells, with no or little expression of 5- and 15-LOX. NDGA, a general LOX inhibitor and BHPP, a 12-LOX-selective inhibitor, induced rapid and dose-dependent apoptosis of serum-cultured W256 cells as well as several other tumor (in particular leukemia) cell lines, thus suggesting a potential role for LOX in mediating serum-supported tumor cell survival. The molecular mechanism of NDGA-induced W256 cell death was subsequently investigated. NDGA-induced apoptosis could be significantly postponed by overexpression of 12-LOX, thus suggesting that the NDGA effect is, at least partly, dependent on its inhibition of LOX (i.e., 12-LOX). W256 cell apoptosis induced by NDGA could also be effectively inhibited by GSH-elevating or thiol agents as well as by lipid peroxidation inhibitors and an inhibitor of mitochondria respiratory chain rotenone. Further experiments demonstrated that NDGA treatment triggered rapid lipid peroxidation leading to the depletion of cytosolic and mitochondrial GSH pools. Interestingly, the lipid peroxidation induced by NDGA could not be inhibited by conventional free radical scavengers nor by cyclooxygenase or cytochrome P-450 monooxygenase inhibitors. In summary, the present work suggests a role of 12-LOX in regulating serum (growth factor)-supported survival of certain tumor cells.","['Tang, D G', 'Honn, K V']","['Tang DG', 'Honn KV']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan 48202, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Lipid Peroxides)', '0 (Lipoxygenase Inhibitors)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Rhodamines)', '03L9OT429T (Rotenone)', '109244-58-8 (dihydrorhodamine 123)', '7BO8G1BYQU (Masoprocol)', 'EC 1.13.11.31 (Arachidonate 12-Lipoxygenase)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Arachidonate 12-Lipoxygenase/*physiology', 'Carcinosarcoma/*pathology', 'Cell Survival/physiology', 'Glutathione/*deficiency', 'Lipid Peroxides/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Lipoxygenase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Masoprocol/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Monocytes/*cytology', 'Rats', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Rhodamines/metabolism', 'Rotenone/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/08/01 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1997/08/01 00:00'],"['1997/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1997/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-4652(199708)172:2<155::AID-JCP3>3.0.CO;2-N [pii]', '10.1002/(SICI)1097-4652(199708)172:2<155::AID-JCP3>3.0.CO;2-N [doi]']",ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 1997 Aug;172(2):155-70. doi: 10.1002/(SICI)1097-4652(199708)172:2<155::AID-JCP3>3.0.CO;2-N.,,,['CA 47115/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Leukemia relapse, however, remains a significant clinical problem. Relapse following BMT presumably results from the expansion of small numbers of recipient leukaemic cells which have survived the conditioning therapy. In order to define patients who are at a high risk of leukaemia relapse, a variety of techniques have been employed to detect persistence of host haemopoiesis (mixed chimaerism, MC) or residual leukaemia (minimal residual disease, MRD). However, the precise relationship between the detection of MC and MRD post-BMT is unknown. We have investigated chimaerism and MRD status in 22 patients who were in clinical and haematological remission post-allogeneic BMT for chronic phase CML. Chimaerism was assessed using short tandem repeat PCR (STR-PCR) while BCR-ABL mRNA detection using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed to detect the presence of MRD. Seventeen patients received unmanipulated marrow (non-TCD) while in five patients a T cell-depleted transplant (TCD) was performed as additional GVHD prophylaxis. Chimaerism was evaluated in 18 patients (14 non-TCD, four TCD). Mixed chimaerism was an uncommon finding in recipients of unmanipulated BMT (21%) when compared to TCD BMT (100%). No evidence of MRD, as identified using the BCR-ABL mRNA RT-PCR assay, was detected in those patients who were donor chimaeras. Early and transient MC and MRD was detected in four patients (two non-TCD, two TCD) who have subsequently converted to a donor profile. One patient has stable low-level MC but remains MRD negative 4 years post-BMT. Late MC and MRD was observed in two patients who relapsed >6 years after TCD BMT for CML. We conclude that mixed chimaerism is a rare event in recipients of unmanipulated BMT and that donor chimaerism as detected by STR-PCR assay is consistent with disease-free survival and identifies patients with a low risk of leukaemic relapse post-BMT for CML.","['Gardiner, N', 'Lawler, M', ""O'Riordan, J"", 'DeArce, M', 'Humphries, P', 'McCann, S R']","['Gardiner N', 'Lawler M', ""O'Riordan J"", 'DeArce M', 'Humphries P', 'McCann SR']","['Department of Haematology/Oncology, St James Hospital, Dublin, Ireland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/pathology/physiopathology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm, Residual', '*Transplantation Chimera']",1997/08/01 00:00,1997/08/01 00:01,['1997/08/01 00:00'],"['1997/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.bmt.1700861 [doi]'],ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1997 Aug;20(3):235-41. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1700861.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, only a minority of them will have an HLA-identical sibling donor; unrelated donors, matched or partially mismatched, have been used successfully for patients lacking a related donor. Even though results with allogeneic transplants using unrelated donors are encouraging, the incidence of complications including graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and graft rejection or late graft failure is increased compared to identical sibling transplants. The combination of cyclophosphamide and total body irradiation (TBI) has been used as an effective preparative regimen for allogeneic transplants, however, the total dosage and dosing schedule of both the cyclophosphamide and TBI has varied significantly among studies. To decrease the rate of graft rejection and late graft failure with volunteer donors, we evaluated a preparative regimen of high-dose cyclophosphamide (200 mg/kg over 4 consecutive days, days -8, -7, -6, -5) followed by fractionated TBI (1400 cGy administered in eight fractions over 4 days, days -4, -3, -2, -1). GVHD prophylaxis included FK506 and methotrexate. From July 1993 to January 1996, 43 adult patients, median age 38 years (range 18-58 years), were treated with this preparative regimen. Seventeen patients had low-risk disease and 26 had high-risk disease. Thirty-one donor/recipient pairs were matched for HLA-A, -B, and -DR by serology and molecular typing. Seven additional pairs were minor mismatched at the HLA-A or HLA-B loci. Four other donor/recipient pairs were HLA-A,-B, and -DR identical by serology but allele mismatched at either DRB1 or DQB. Forty patients were evaluable for myeloid engraftment. Engraftment occurred in all 40 patients at a median of 19 days. There were no cases of graft rejection or late graft failure. Nephrotoxicity was the primary adverse event with 26 patients (60%) experiencing a doubling of their creatinine. Hepatic veno-occlusive disease occurred in seven patients, six of whom had high-risk disease. All patients who had relapsed or refractory disease prior to BMT achieved a complete remission following BMT. Six patients transplanted for high-risk disease relapsed a median of 377 days post-BMT. None of the patients with low-risk disease have relapsed following transplant; the Kaplan-Meier survival for those patients with low-risk disease is 62% and 37% for those patients transplanted with high-risk disease (P = 0.0129). The median Karnofsky performance status is 100% (range 70-100%). Therefore, a preparative regimen of high-dose cyclophosphamide and fractionated TBI is an acceptable regimen for patients receiving an allograft from unrelated donors.","['Geller, R B', 'Devine, S M', ""O'Toole, K"", 'Persons, L', 'Keller, J', 'Mauer, D', 'Holland, H K', 'Dix, S P', 'Piotti, M', 'Redei, I', 'Connaghan, G', 'Heffner, L T', 'Hillyer, C D', 'Waller, E K', 'Winton, E F', 'Wingard, J R']","['Geller RB', 'Devine SM', ""O'Toole K"", 'Persons L', 'Keller J', 'Mauer D', 'Holland HK', 'Dix SP', 'Piotti M', 'Redei I', 'Connaghan G', 'Heffner LT', 'Hillyer CD', 'Waller EK', 'Winton EF', 'Wingard JR']","['Leukemia/Bone Marrow Transplantation Program, Department of Medicine, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,"['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cyclophosphamide/*administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Graft Rejection/*prevention & control/*radiotherapy', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*therapy', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome', '*Whole-Body Irradiation']",1997/08/01 00:00,1997/08/01 00:01,['1997/08/01 00:00'],"['1997/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.bmt.1700874 [doi]'],ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1997 Aug;20(3):219-25. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1700874.,,,,,PMC7102093,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SCID mice inoculated with L1210 cells after TBI received a DLI 5 days after TBI to induce the GVL effect. Survival of these mice was longer than that of control nonirradiated mice. Serum levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, IL-1alpha, IL-6, IL-2 and IFN-gamma were significantly elevated, and they reached maximum levels at 5 days post-transplantation. Except for IFN-gamma, all cytokine levels were higher in irradiated mice than those in nonconditioned mice. Cytotoxicity against L1210 cells mediated by splenocytes from irradiated recipients was greater than that mediated by effector cells from nonirradiated mice. All the irradiated mice survived more than 120 days after L1210 rechallenge, while all nonirradiated mice died of leukemia within 5 weeks.

In this study, we show that HAM/TSP patients also have elevated levels of peripheral blood CD8+ T cells that produce intracellular IFN-gamma. To address the potential role of soluble mediators secreted by CD8+ T cells in the pathogenesis of HAM/TSP, we have analyzed the capacity of a panel of nine HTLV-I-specific CD8+ CTL clones derived from three HAM/TSP patients to secrete cytokines, chemokines, and matrix metalloproteinases. The results demonstrate that the majority of these CTL clones secrete IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, macrophage-inflammatory protein-1alpha and -1beta, IL-16, and matrix metalloproteinase-9.

It has multiple in vitro activities, including copper transport, lipid pro- and antioxidant activity, and oxidation of ferrous ion and aromatic amines; however, its physiologic role is uncertain. Although ceruloplasmin is synthesized primarily by the liver in adult humans, production by cells of monocytic origin has been reported. We here show that IFN-gamma is a potent inducer of ceruloplasmin synthesis by monocytic cells. Activation of human monoblastic leukemia U937 cells with IFN-gamma increased the production of ceruloplasmin by at least 20-fold. The identity of the protein was confirmed by plasmin fingerprinting. IFN-gamma also increased ceruloplasmin mRNA. Induction followed a 2- to 4-h lag and was partially blocked by cycloheximide, indicating a requirement for newly synthesized factors. Ceruloplasmin induction in monocytic cells was agonist specific, as IL-1, IL-4, IL-6, IFN-alpha, IFN-beta, TNF-alpha, and LPS were completely ineffective. The induction was also cell type specific, as IFN-gamma did not induce ceruloplasmin synthesis in endothelial or smooth muscle cells. In contrast, IFN-gamma was stimulatory in other monocytic cells, including THP-1 cells and human peripheral blood monocytes, and also in HepG2 cells. Ceruloplasmin secreted by IFN-gamma-stimulated U937 cells had ferroxidase activity and was, in fact, the only secreted protein with this activity. Monocytic cell-derived ceruloplasmin may contribute to defense responses via its ferroxidase activity, which may drive iron homeostasis in a direction unfavorable to invasive organisms.","['Mazumder, B', 'Mukhopadhyay, C K', 'Prok, A', 'Cathcart, M K', 'Fox, P L']","['Mazumder B', 'Mukhopadhyay CK', 'Prok A', 'Cathcart MK', 'Fox PL']","['Department of Cell Biology, The Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, OH 44195, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'EC 1.16.3.1 (Ceruloplasmin)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Ceruloplasmin/*biosynthesis/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/*pharmacology', 'Monocytes/*drug effects/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis']",1997/08/15 00:00,1997/08/15 00:01,['1997/08/15 00:00'],"['1997/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1997/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1997 Aug 15;159(4):1938-44.,,,"['HL29582/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL41178/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL52692/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,['NASA'],"['NASA Discipline Regulatory Physiology', 'Non-NASA Center']",['Fox PL'],"['Fox, P L']","['Cleveland Clinic Found, OH']",,,,,,,

Tpl-2 is activated in Moloney murine leukemia virus-induced rat T lymphomas, due to a truncation in the C-terminal region of the protein. cot is a very closely related gene, if not the human homologue. The truncated form of Cot has been shown to have a higher transforming activity than the nontruncated form. In this paper we show that an increase in truncated Cot kinase expression correlates with an increase in IL-2 production in anti-CD3-treated Jurkat cells. Truncated Cot expression also cooperates with PHA or phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu) and calcium ionophore for IL-2 production in Jurkat cells. Both the truncated and nontruncated Cot forms increased IL-2 transcription because they enhanced transcription of a reporter gene linked to the IL-2 promoter. The expression of a dominant negative form of Cot inhibits transcription directed by the IL-2 promoter in Jurkat cells stimulated by PDBu and ionophore. These data suggest a role of Tpl-2/Cot kinase in IL-2 production during T lymphocyte activation and could also explain its role in Moloney murine leukemia virus-induced lymphomagenesis.","['Ballester, A', 'Tobena, R', 'Lisbona, C', 'Calvo, V', 'Alemany, S']","['Ballester A', 'Tobena R', 'Lisbona C', 'Calvo V', 'Alemany S']","['Instituto de Investigaciones Biomedicas, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas, Facultad de Medicina Universidad Autonoma de Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Ionophores)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '37558-16-0 (Phorbol 12,13-Dibutyrate)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (MAP Kinase Kinase Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (MAP3K8 protein, human)']",IM,"['CD3 Complex/physiology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Ionophores/pharmacology', 'Jurkat Cells', '*MAP Kinase Kinase Kinases', 'Phorbol 12,13-Dibutyrate/pharmacology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*physiology', 'Transfection']",1997/08/15 00:00,1997/08/15 00:01,['1997/08/15 00:00'],"['1997/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1997/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1997 Aug 15;159(4):1613-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, DR- cell selection depletes the majority of committed hematopoietic progenitors, which may be important for early engraftment. Furthermore, only a small number of DR- cells may be selectable in certain patients. These impediments to the use of DR- cells for autografting may be overcome through the development of ex vivo culture systems that support expansion and initial differentiation of primitive progenitors. Because 2-week culture of DR- cells in a stroma ""noncontact"" system supplemented with interleukin-3 (IL-3) and macrophage inflammatory protein 1-alpha (MIP-1alpha) expands both long-term culture-initiating cells (LTC-ICs) and colony-forming cells (CFCs), we adapted this system to a clinically applicable method for expanding LTC-ICs and CFCs ex vivo. In initial small-scale studies, DR cells were grown in stroma conditioned medium (SCM) supplemented with IL-3 with or without additional growth-promoting cytokines and the chemokines PF-4 and BB10010, all approved for clinical use. An IL-3 dose-dependent expansion of committed progenitors and LTC-ICs was observed when DR- cells were cultured in tissue culture plates in SCM+IL-3 for 2 weeks. Similar CFC expansion along with increased (5-fold) LTC-IC expansion was observed following addition of PF-4 to SCM+IL-3 cultures. The addition of stem cell factor (SCF), but not of IL-6, IL-11, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), granulocyte-macrophage (GM)-CSF, IL-1, and IL-7, increased CFC and LTC-IC expansion beyond the levels observed with SCM+IL-3 alone. We next evaluated the suitability of this culture system for scale-up. Culture of 2-6 x 10(5) DR- cells in gas-permeable bags with SCM+IL-3 resulted in similar CFC and LTC-IC expansion as seen in small-scale cultures. In addition, we observed that progenitors capable of differentiating to natural killer (NK)-cells were maintained under these conditions. Finally, we found that BCR/ABL mRNA-negative CFCs and LTC-ICs present in DR- cells selected from steady-state CML marrow could be expanded in large-scale SCM+IL-3 cultures. We conclude that culture of DR- cells for 2 weeks in SCM+IL-3 culture, with or without PF-4 or SCF, results in significant CFC and LTC-IC expansion and lymphoid NK progenitor maintenance. This culture system is readily adaptable to the expansion of primitive progenitors for autotransplantation.","['Bhatia, R', 'McGlave, P B', 'Miller, J S', 'Wissink, S', 'Lin, W N', 'Verfaillie, C M']","['Bhatia R', 'McGlave PB', 'Miller JS', 'Wissink S', 'Lin WN', 'Verfaillie CM']","['Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis 55455, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Chemokine CCL3)', '0 (Chemokine CCL4)', '0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Macrophage Inflammatory Proteins)', '37270-94-3 (Platelet Factor 4)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chemokine CCL3', 'Chemokine CCL4', '*Culture Media, Conditioned', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cells', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Natural', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive', 'Macrophage Inflammatory Proteins/pharmacology', 'Platelet Factor 4/pharmacology', 'Stromal Cells/*metabolism']",1997/08/01 00:00,1997/08/01 00:01,['1997/08/01 00:00'],"['1997/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1997 Aug;25(9):980-91.,,,"['R01-CA-4581401/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-HL-4993001/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-HO-5403901/HO/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

M-CSF was detected in the supernatant of both cell lines and addition of a neutralizing anti-M-CSF antibody inhibited cell growth. The two LAMA cell lines were found to express TGF-beta1, -beta2, and -beta3 mRNAs and to secrete TGF-beta mostly in latent form. Addition of anti-TGF-beta antibodies to the culture medium increased their proliferation, whereas TGF-beta1 inhibited cell proliferation by downregulating the c-myc mRNA. These results show that the proliferation of both LAMA cell lines is positively and negatively regulated by autocrine mechanisms, implying the presence of M-CSF and TGF-beta, respectively.

However, the role of wt1 expression in non malignant hematopoietic cells remains unclear. To characterize the expression of wt1 in differentiating hematopoietic progenitors, we isolated and cultured CD34+ progenitor cells from four healthy bone marrow donors with stem cell factor (SCF) and granulocyte colony stimulating-factor (G-CSF) to induce differentiation into granulocytes. Four different cultures were carried out for 12 days. During culture, wt1 mRNA expression was analyzed by defining its ratio relative to beta-actin using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). To monitor the stage of differentiation, expression of cell surface markers and peroxidase was analyzed daily. The initial purity of CD34+ cells ranged between 80% and 90%; after 12 days, the frequency of neutrophil bands and segmented neutrophils was approximately 60%. Using RT-PCR to determine the ratio of wt1 to beta-actin expression, we reproducibly detected maximum expression of wt1 mRNA at day 0 in two cultures and at day 1 in two other CD34+ cell cultures; at both these time points nearly all cells fulfilled the morphological and immunephenotypical criteria of early hematopoietic blast cells. Wt1 expression dropped rapidly at day 1 and 2, respectively, in these two pairs of cultures, and was accompanied by an increase of cells expressing CD33 surface antigen.

We found that G alpha(s), G alpha(i2), and G alpha(q/11) proteins were expressed at high levels at all stages of granulomonocytic and erythroid differentiation, whereas expression of G alpha12 and G alpha16 proteins in normal myeloid cells was lineage-specific. G alpha12 proteins were expressed in erythroid progenitors, monocytes, and platelets, but not in normal granulocytic cells. This lineage specificity was lost in leukemic cells: G alpha12 proteins were found in human leukemic cells of both granulocytic and erythroid lineages. G alpha16 proteins were revealed in myeloid cells as two bands (43 and 46 kD), implying that G alpha16 exist in short and long forms. The 43-kD form was predominant in normal granulomonocytic cells, whereas erythroid progenitors and platelets expressed mostly the 46-kD form. Both forms of G alpha16 proteins varied during cell differentiation: in normal hematopoietic cells, G alpha16 protein expression was high in CD34+ cells, then decreased sharply during granulocytic and erythroid differentiation. In leukemic granulocytic HL60 and NB4 cells, downregulation of G alpha16 proteins was an early event (8 hours) in the process of neutrophil differentiation; in contrast, expression of G alpha16 proteins remained high during normal monocytic differentiation and in HL60 cells differentiating into monocytes with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) or gamma-interferon (IFNgamma). Finally, we found that primary myeloid leukemia blasts, as well as leukemic cell lines, expressed G alpha16 proteins at levels higher than those found in normal CD34+ progenitors.

A single-centre experience.,299-306,"In the present single institution study of 66 leukaemia patients (28 AML, 23 ALL, 15 CML), the factors influencing haematological recovery after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (alloBMT) were analysed retrospectively to identify the optimal conditions required for rapid haematological recovery after alloBMT. All patients received GVHD prophylaxis with cyclosporine A plus methotrexate. The mean number of days required to achieve a neutrophil count > or = 0.5 x 10(9)/l after alloBMT was 17 (range 9-27), 19 patients (28.8%) had rapid neutrophil recovery within 15 days after alloBMT. Haematological recovery was more rapid in the 38 patients without GVHD or with only grade I GVHD. Also, 50% and 40% of patients receiving 10 (n = 18) or 5 (n = 20) micrograms/kg G-CSF per day, respectively, had rapid neutrophil recovery within 15 days after alloBMT, as against only 7.1% of patients not receiving G-CSF after the transplant (n = 28); P < 0.001. The neutrophil recovery was similar in patients receiving either fresh or cryopreserved allografts and either a TBI-containing or a busulfan-containing conditioning regimen. A significant correlation was found between the neutrophil recovery and either the MNCs or CFU-GM contents of the allografts. The mean number of days required for neutrophil recovery was only 16 (range 9-24) in patients receiving allografts containing > 1 x 10(5) CFU-GM/kg (n = 28), as against 19 (range 13-27) in patients receiving allografts containing < or = 1 x 10(5) CFU-GM/kg (n = 35). Three patients receiving allografts containing < 0.5 x 10(5) CFU-GM/kg had primary neutrophil engraftment failure. The mean number of days required to achieve a platelet count > or = 20 x 10(9)/l was 21 (range 11-50), and 30 patients (46.9%) had platelet recovery within 20 days after alloBMT. The platelet recovery after alloBMT was not affected by the type of leukaemia, conditioning regimen, or G-CSF administration. The mean number of days required for platelet recovery after alloBMT was 20 in patients receiving allografts containing > 1.0 x 10(5) BFU-E/kg (n = 35), as against 23 days in patients receiving allografts containing < or = 1.0 x 10(5) BFU-E/kg (n = 24). Seven patients receiving allografts containing < 0.5 x 10(5) BFU-E/kg had primary platelet engraftment failure. The present study has identified the high number of progenitor cells in the allografts infused and the daily administration of G-CSF posttransplant as the optimal combination for rapid neutrophil recovery after alloBMT. More significantly, the number of BFU-E in allografts was the most significant determining factor in platelet recovery after alloBMT. The development of GVHD of grade II or more during the first weeks after alloBMT was associated with slower haematological recovery, a longer period of fever during neutropenia and longer hospitalization.","['Hassan, H T', 'Krog, C', 'Stockschlader, M', 'Zeller, W', 'Kruger, W', 'Erttmann, R', 'Zander, A R']","['Hassan HT', 'Krog C', 'Stockschlader M', 'Zeller W', 'Kruger W', 'Erttmann R', 'Zander AR']","['Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, Hamburg University Hospital Eppendorf, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Support Care Cancer,Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer,9302957,"['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Blood Platelets/drug effects', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Chi-Square Distribution', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cyclosporine/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*prevention & control', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia/pathology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/*therapeutic use', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutrophils/drug effects', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Statistics, Nonparametric', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1997/07/01 00:00,1997/07/01 00:01,['1997/07/01 00:00'],"['1997/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s005200050077 [doi]'],ppublish,Support Care Cancer. 1997 Jul;5(4):299-306. doi: 10.1007/s005200050077.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It binds to a high affinity receptor (G-CSF-R) expressed on myeloid cells, for which the signal transduction mechanisms other than protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) activation have not been completely identified. We explored the potential involvement of protein kinase-C (PKC) in G-CSF-R signal transduction. In this report, we provide direct evidence of PKC activation by G-CSF-R. G-CSF treatment of peripheral blood neutrophils, granulocytic cell lines (HL-60, NFS-60, KG-1), and monocytic cell lines (WEHI-3B,U-937) resulted in PKC activation. Chelerythrine chloride and HA-100, an isoquinolinesulfonamide derivative, the specific inhibitors of PKC, 1,2-Bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetra-acetic acid (BAPTA), a chelator of intracellular calcium, and 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoic acid 8-(diethylamino)-octyl ester (TMB-8), an inhibitor of intracellular calcium release, blocked G-CSF-induced PKC activation in HL-60 cells, and reduced CD11b upregulation in neutrophils, but did not affect ligand-binding or down-modulation of G-CSF-R. Methyl 2,5-dihydroxycinnamate (MDHC), a potent inhibitor of protein tyrosine kinases (PTK), also inhibited PKC activation in response to G-CSF treatment, suggesting that PKC activation may occur downstream of PTK activation. Our results demonstrate the involvement of PKC in G-CSF-R signal transduction, and suggest a common signaling pathway in myeloid cells of granulocytic and monocytic lineages.","['Deshpande, R V', 'Peterson, R H', 'Moore, M A']","['Deshpande RV', 'Peterson RH', 'Moore MA']","['James Ewing Laboratory of Developmental Hematopoiesis, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,"['0 (Alkaloids)', '0 (Benzophenanthridines)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Iodine Radioisotopes)', '0 (Macrophage-1 Antigen)', '0 (Phenanthridines)', '10028-17-8 (Tritium)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '526U7A2651 (Egtazic Acid)', '57818-92-5 (8-(N,N-diethylamino)octyl-3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoate)', '632XD903SP (Gallic Acid)', 'E3B045W6X0 (chelerythrine)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', ""K22DDW77C0 (1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid)"", 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",IM,"['Alkaloids', 'Animals', 'Benzophenanthridines', 'Egtazic Acid/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Gallic Acid/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/drug effects/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Iodine Radioisotopes', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Macrophage-1 Antigen/drug effects/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Neutrophils/drug effects/metabolism', 'Phenanthridines/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase C/antagonists & inhibitors/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Thymidine/metabolism/pharmacokinetics', 'Tritium', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/09/01 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1997/09/01 00:00'],"['1997/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1997/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-4644(19970901)66:3<286::AID-JCB2>3.0.CO;2-L [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1097-4644(19970901)66:3<286::aid-jcb2>3.0.co;2-l [doi]']",ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 1997 Sep 1;66(3):286-96. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1097-4644(19970901)66:3<286::aid-jcb2>3.0.co;2-l.,,,['HL-46546/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Otologic involvement is very rare and has only been reported as an autopsy finding. PATIENT AND METHODS: We describe the case of a 5-year-old girl with CD10 positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who developed an isolated otologic relapse 18 months after the initial diagnosis of ALL. RESULTS: This otologic relapse presented as an atypical otitis media related to a mass of the middle ear. The leukemic infiltration of the middle ear was demonstrated by histologic examination. A cytogenetic change characterized by the occurrence of t(1;19)(q23;p13) was observed in the leukemic cells from the middle ear, and the t(1;19) molecular fusion transcript E2A-PBX1 was detected in the bone marrow by polymerase chain reaction. CONCLUSION: The ear is an exceedingly rare site of relapse in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a phase I/II trial in parallel with Children's Cancer Group (CCG) study 0922, which involved dose escalation of Ida at levels of mg/m2, 9 mg/m2, and 12 mg/m2 over 15 minutes on days 0, 1, and 2. As phase I safety was documented by CCG, we increased the dose of Ida given on day 0, 1, and 2 of the F-ara-A/ara-C infusion (F-ara-A: 10.5 mg/m2 over 15 minutes and 1.27 mg/m2/hour for 48 hours followed by ara-C: 390 mg/m2 over 15 minutes and 101 mg/m2/hour for 72 hours). RESULTS: Ten of 15 patients achieved remission. There was one toxic death due to adult respiratory distress syndrome. The median time to an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) > 200/microliter was 29 days; ANC > 1,000/microliter was 41 days; and platelets > 100,000/microliter was 45 days. CONCLUSIONS: A dose of 12 mg/m2/day x 3 of Ida did not exceed dose-limiting toxicity with this combination of F-ara-A/ara-C. Substantial activity of this regimen was seen in pediatric patients with AML.","['Leahey, A', 'Kelly, K', 'Rorke, L B', 'Lange, B']","['Leahey A', 'Kelly K', 'Rorke LB', 'Lange B']","[""Department of Pediatrics, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, University of Pennsylvania 19104, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/administration & dosage', 'Infant', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/drug therapy', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives']",1997/07/01 00:00,1997/07/01 00:01,['1997/07/01 00:00'],"['1997/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00043426-199707000-00007 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 1997 Jul-Aug;19(4):304-8. doi: 10.1097/00043426-199707000-00007.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we show that this induction of NF-kappaB activity occurs in a biphasic mode: first, a transient, IkappaBalpha degradation-dependent phase of activity, also induced by the nonvirulent species Listeria innocua, which is mediated by binding of the bacteria to the macrophage, or by adding Listeria-derived lipoteichoic acid to the macrophage; the second persistent phase of activation is only markedly induced when the bacteria enter the cytoplasm of the host cell and express the virulence genes plcA and plcB, encoding two phospholipases. We suggest that products of the enzymatic activity of phospholipases directly interfere with host cell signal transduction pathways, thus leading to persistent NF-kappaB activation via persistent IkappaBbeta degradation.","['Hauf, N', 'Goebel, W', 'Fiedler, F', 'Sokolovic, Z', 'Kuhn, M']","['Hauf N', 'Goebel W', 'Fiedler F', 'Sokolovic Z', 'Kuhn M']","['Theodor Boveri Institut fur Biowissenschaften, Lehrstuhl fur Mikrobiologie, Am Hubland, 97074 Wurzburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (I kappa B beta protein)', '0 (I-kappa B Proteins)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (NFKBIA protein, human)', '0 (Nfkbia protein, mouse)', '0 (Teichoic Acids)', '139874-52-5 (NF-KappaB Inhibitor alpha)', '56411-57-5 (lipoteichoic acid)', 'EC 3.1.- (Phospholipases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Humans', '*I-kappa B Proteins', 'Leukemia P388/*physiopathology', 'Lipopolysaccharides/*pharmacology', '*Listeria monocytogenes', 'Listeriosis/*metabolism', 'Macrophages/metabolism/*microbiology', 'Mice', 'NF-KappaB Inhibitor alpha', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'Phospholipases/*pharmacology', 'Teichoic Acids/*pharmacology']",1997/08/19 00:00,1997/08/19 00:01,['1997/08/19 00:00'],"['1997/08/19 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/08/19 00:01 [medline]', '1997/08/19 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.94.17.9394 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1997 Aug 19;94(17):9394-9. doi: 10.1073/pnas.94.17.9394.,,,,,PMC23201,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This apoptosis can be suppressed by some cytokines, protease inhibitors, and antioxidants. We now show that induction of apoptosis by overexpressing wild-type p53 is associated with activation of interleukin-1beta-converting enzyme (ICE)-like proteases, resulting in cleavage of poly(ADP- ribose) polymerase and the proenzyme of the ICE-like protease Nedd-2. Activation of these proteases and apoptosis were suppressed by the cytokine interleukin 6 or by a combination of the cytokine interferon gamma and the antioxidant butylated hydroxyanisole, and activation of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase and apoptosis were suppressed by some protease inhibitors. In a clone of M1 cells that did not express p53, vincristine or doxorubicin induced protease activation and apoptosis that were not suppressed by protease inhibitors, but were suppressed by interleukin 6. In another myeloid leukemia (7-M12) doxorubicin also induced protease activation and apoptosis that were not suppressed by protease inhibitors, but were suppressed by granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. The results indicate that (i) overexpression of wild-type p53 by itself or treatment with cytotoxic compounds in wild-type p53-expressing or p53-nonexpressing myeloid leukemic cells is associated with activation of ICE-like proteases; (ii) cytokines exert apoptosis-suppressing functions upstream of protease activation; (iii) the cytotoxic compounds induce additional pathways in apoptosis; and (iv) cytokines can also suppress these other components of the apoptotic machinery.","['Lotem, J', 'Sachs, L']","['Lotem J', 'Sachs L']","['Department of Molecular Genetics, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot 76100, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 2)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Caspase 2', '*Caspases', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/physiology', 'Cytokines/*pharmacology/physiology', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Mice', 'Proteins/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*physiology']",1997/08/19 00:00,1997/08/19 00:01,['1997/08/19 00:00'],"['1997/08/19 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/08/19 00:01 [medline]', '1997/08/19 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.94.17.9349 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1997 Aug 19;94(17):9349-53. doi: 10.1073/pnas.94.17.9349.,,,,,PMC23189,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Determining the molecular basis of progression should lead to new opportunities for improved diagnostic and therapeutic modalities. Through the use of subtraction hybridization, a gene associated with transformation progression in virus- and oncogene-transformed rat embryo cells, progression elevated gene-3 (PEG-3), has been cloned. PEG-3 shares significant nucleotide and amino acid sequence homology with the hamster growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible gene gadd34 and a homologous murine gene, MyD116, that is induced during induction of terminal differentiation by interleukin-6 in murine myeloid leukemia cells. PEG-3 expression is elevated in rodent cells displaying a progressed-transformed phenotype and in rodent cells transformed by various oncogenes, including Ha-ras, v-src, mutant type 5 adenovirus (Ad5), and human papilloma virus type 18. The PEG-3 gene is transcriptionally activated in rodent cells, as is gadd34 and MyD116, after treatment with DNA damaging agents, including methyl methanesulfonate and gamma-irradiation. In contrast, only PEG-3 is transcriptionally active in rodent cells displaying a progressed phenotype. Although transfection of PEG-3 into normal and Ad5-transformed cells only marginally suppresses colony formation, stable overexpression of PEG-3 in Ad5-transformed rat embryo cells elicits the progression phenotype. These results indicate that PEG-3 is a new member of the gadd and MyD gene family with similar yet distinct properties and this gene may directly contribute to the transformation progression phenotype. Moreover, these studies support the hypothesis that constitutive expression of a DNA damage response may mediate cancer progression.","['Su, Z Z', 'Shi, Y', 'Fisher, P B']","['Su ZZ', 'Shi Y', 'Fisher PB']","['Department of Urology, Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Ppp1r15a protein, rat)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (PPP1R15A protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Protein Phosphatase 1)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', '*Antigens, Differentiation', 'Cell Cycle/*genetics', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Cricetinae', 'DNA Damage/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Protein Phosphatase 1', 'Proteins/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Rats', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid']",1997/08/19 00:00,1997/08/19 00:01,['1997/08/19 00:00'],"['1997/08/19 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/08/19 00:01 [medline]', '1997/08/19 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.94.17.9125 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1997 Aug 19;94(17):9125-30. doi: 10.1073/pnas.94.17.9125.,,,"['R01 CA035675/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA35675/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC23067,,['GENBANK/AF020618'],,,,,,['Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 1997 Oct 28;94(22):12241'],,,,,,

Aberrant RAR activity may be a causal factor in neoplasia. Human acute promyelocytic leukemia, for example, is tightly linked to chromosomal translocations that fuse novel amino acid sequences (denoted PML, PLZF, and NPM) to the DNA-binding and hormone-binding domains of RARalpha. The resulting chimeric receptors have unique transcriptional properties that may contribute to leukemogenesis. Normal RARs repress gene transcription by associating with ancillary factors denoted corepressors (also referred to as SMRT, N-CoR, TRAC, or RIP13). We report here that the PML-RARalpha and PLZF-RARalpha oncoproteins retain the ability of RARalpha to associate with corepressors, and that this corepressor association correlates with certain aspects of the leukemic phenotype. Unexpectedly, the PLZF moiety itself can interact with SMRT corepressor. This interaction with corepressor is mediated, in part, by a POZ motif within PLZF. Given the presence of POZ motifs in a number of known transcriptional repressors, similar interactions with SMRT may play a role in transcriptional silencing by a variety of both receptor and nonreceptor transcription factors.","['Hong, S H', 'David, G', 'Wong, C W', 'Dejean, A', 'Privalsky, M L']","['Hong SH', 'David G', 'Wong CW', 'Dejean A', 'Privalsky ML']","['Section of Microbiology, Division of Biological Sciences, University of California, Davis, CA 95616, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (NCOR2 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Receptor Co-Repressor 2)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '0 (RARA protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '147855-37-6 (ZBTB16 protein, human)']",IM,"['DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Receptor Co-Repressor 2', 'Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/genetics/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/08/19 00:00,1997/08/19 00:01,['1997/08/19 00:00'],"['1997/08/19 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/08/19 00:01 [medline]', '1997/08/19 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.94.17.9028 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1997 Aug 19;94(17):9028-33. doi: 10.1073/pnas.94.17.9028.,,,"['R37 CA053394/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA-53394/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC23013,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To determine the incidence of hypocholesterolemia in patients with hairy cell leukemia (HCL), we measured the serum cholesterol levels before and after a single cycle of 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine (2-CdA) in 46 patients. The mean pre-treatment serum cholesterol level was 152.8 mg/dl (range, 60 to 293 mg/dl). The mean post-treatment serum cholesterol level was 190.0 mg/dl. This was significantly higher than the pre-treatment values (P <0.0001). Twelve patients who had previously undergone splenectomy showed a similar response to treatment, with a pre-treatment value of 180.0 mg/dl and a post-treatment value of 219.8 mg/dl (P < 0.0001). However, there was a significant difference in the pre-treatment serum cholesterol levels in the nonsplenectomized patients (143.0 mg/dl) compared to the splenectomized patients (180.0 mg/dl) (P < 0.03). The pre-treatment serum cholesterol did not correlate with the pre-treatment splenic index (correlation coefficient = -0.39, P < 0.065). Similarly, there was no correlation between the change in splenic index and the change in serum cholesterol level post-treatment. These findings suggest that hypocholesterolemia in HCL is related to tumor burden and not to splenomegaly alone. Since cholesterol is critical to hairy cell metabolism and structure, treatment strategies interfering with cholesterol synthesis may be productive.","['Pandolfino, J', 'Hakimian, D', 'Rademaker, A W', 'Tallman, M S']","['Pandolfino J', 'Hakimian D', 'Rademaker AW', 'Tallman MS']","['Robert H.

However, despite various proposed mechanisms, its detailed regulatory mechanism is not fully understood. The functional coupling between phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) and PLD was investigated in N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP)-stimulated human promyelocytic leukemia HL60 cells, using wortmannin, a fungal metabolite that is known as a selective inhibitor for phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. Treatment of cells with this drug inhibited the formation of both phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3), a product of PI 3-kinase, and phosphatidylbutanol (PBut), the specific product of transphosphatidylation due to PLD in the presence of butanol, with similar concentration dependence (IC50 = 30-70 nM). Another PI 3-kinase inhibitor, 2-(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one (LY294002) also inhibited PBut formation in a concentration-dependent manner. However, wortmannin failed to inhibit phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-induced PLD activation in whole cells and membrane PLD activity in an in vitro assay system, indicating that inhibition of fMLP-induced PLD activation by wortmannin was not due to its direct effect on PLD activity. These results suggest that a major part of inhibition of PLD activation by wortmannin might be mediated through its effect on PI 3-kinase.","['Nakamura, M', 'Nakashima, S', 'Katagiri, Y', 'Nozawa, Y']","['Nakamura M', 'Nakashima S', 'Katagiri Y', 'Nozawa Y']","['Department of Pharmacy, Gifu University Hospital, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Androstadienes)', '0 (Chromones)', '0 (Morpholines)', '0 (Phosphatidylinositol Phosphates)', '0 (Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors)', '0 (phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate)', '31M2U1DVID (2-(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)', '59880-97-6 (N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor))', 'EC 3.1.4.4 (Phospholipase D)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'XVA4O219QW (Wortmannin)']",IM,"['Androstadienes/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Membrane/drug effects', 'Chromones/*pharmacology', 'Enzyme Activation', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Morpholines/*pharmacology', 'N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases', 'Phosphatidylinositol Phosphates/metabolism', 'Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Phospholipase D/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor)/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate', 'Wortmannin']",1997/06/15 00:00,1997/06/15 00:01,['1997/06/15 00:00'],"['1997/06/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/06/15 00:01 [medline]', '1997/06/15 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-2952(97)00169-X [pii]', '10.1016/s0006-2952(97)00169-x [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1997 Jun 15;53(12):1929-36. doi: 10.1016/s0006-2952(97)00169-x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Studies were obtained by searching Medline and CancerLit and by review of bibliographies of published trials. We reviewed studies that examined dose-intense (DI) chemotherapy alone, in combination with hematopoietic colony-stimulating factors (CSFs), or high-dose therapy (HDT) with autologous bone marrow support (ABMT). RESULTS: DI therapy without CSF or ABMT has not been shown to improve overall outcome in any tumor except consolidative therapy of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). In solid tumors, many published studies suggest that less than standard-intensity chemotherapy is suboptimal, but few studies that examined higher compared with standard-dose therapy have shown a significant difference in outcome. No studies have convincingly demonstrated improved overall survival (OS) with DI therapy with CSF support. The use of HDT with ABMT has been shown to improve survival in multiple myeloma (MM), as well as relapsed intermediate- and high-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). High-dose chemotherapy with ABMT is promising in patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC), but it should not yet be considered a standard approach for these patients. CONCLUSION: DI chemotherapy is an acceptable and standard therapeutic maneuver for patients with AML in first remission, MM, and relapsed aggressive NHL. In solid tumors, the use of DI chemotherapy either alone or with cytokine support has not been shown to improve outcome and should not be considered standard therapy. Current randomized trials should provide definitive answers about the role of DI therapy in solid tumors.","['Savarese, D M', 'Hsieh, C', 'Stewart, F M']","['Savarese DM', 'Hsieh C', 'Stewart FM']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology and the Cancer Center, University of Massachusetts Medical Center, Worcester 01655, USA. diane.savarese@bangate.ummed.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Clinical Trials, Phase III as Topic', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/drug therapy/mortality/therapy', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/mortality/therapy', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Survival Rate']",1997/08/01 00:00,1997/08/01 00:01,['1997/08/01 00:00'],"['1997/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1997.15.8.2981 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1997 Aug;15(8):2981-95. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1997.15.8.2981.,84,,,['J Clin Oncol. 1997 Aug;15(8):2765-8.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: In 198 adult patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in complete remission (CR), M-CSF (8 x 10(6) U/d) or placebo was administered from 1 day after the end of each consolidation chemotherapy for 14 days. RESULTS: The duration and incidence of febrile neutropenia was significantly reduced by 34% (P = .00285) and 17% (P = .02065), respectively, in 88 assessable patients in the M-CSF group compared with those in 94 assessable patients in the placebo group.

This study evaluated the impact of differing presymptomatic CNS therapies in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) patients with a good response to prednisone (PGR) according to WBC count and Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster (BFM) risk factor (RF). PATIENTS: A total of 192 patients (141 boys; median age, 7.5 years) with T-ALL, PGR, RF less than 1.7, and no CNS leukemia diagnosed between 1990 and 1995 were enrolled onto the ALL-BFM 90 (n = 123) or AIEOP-ALL 91 (n = 69) study. Presymptomatic CNS therapy consisted of cranial radiation (CRT) and intrathecal methotrexate (I.T. MTX) (11 doses) in the BFM study and of extended triple intrathecal therapy (T.I.T.) (17 doses) in the Associazione Italiana Ematologia Oncologia Pediatrica (AIEOP) study. Patients were divided into a low-WBC group (WBC count < 100,000/microL) and a high-WBC group (WBC count > 100,000/microL). EFS was compared using the log-rank test. RESULTS: For patients treated with CRT and I.T. MTX (BFM group), the 3-year EFS rate was 89.8% (SE = 3.5) for 99 patients in the low-WBC group versus 81.9% (SE = 8.2) in the high-WBC group (difference not significant). Conversely, for patients treated with T.I.T. alone (AIEOP group), the EFS rate was 80.6% (SE = 5.6) in 55 patients with a low WBC count versus 17.9% (SE = 11.0) in 14 patients with a high WBC count (P < .001). CONCLUSION: These data suggest that CRT may not be necessary in PGR T-ALL patients with a WBC count less than 100,000/microL; on the contrary, in patients with a high count, extended T.I.T. may be inferior to CRT and I.T. MTX.","['Conter, V', 'Schrappe, M', 'Arico, M', 'Reiter, A', 'Rizzari, C', 'Dordelmann, M', 'Valsecchi, M G', 'Zimmermann, M', 'Ludwig, W D', 'Basso, G', 'Masera, G', 'Riehm, H']","['Conter V', 'Schrappe M', 'Arico M', 'Reiter A', 'Rizzari C', 'Dordelmann M', 'Valsecchi MG', 'Zimmermann M', 'Ludwig WD', 'Basso G', 'Masera G', 'Riehm H']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Milano, S.

The phase I study was extended to a limited phase II study to assess the activity of this combination in children with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a multiinstitutional study within the CCG. Eleven patients were entered onto the phase I study: seven with AML, three with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and one with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). The maximal-tolerated dose (MTD) of fludarabine and cytarabine determined in a previous study was a fludarabine loading dose (LD) of 10.5 mg/m2 followed by a continuous infusion (CI) of 30.5 mg/m2/24 hours for 48 hours, followed by cytarabine LD 390 mg/m2, then CI 101 mg/m2/h for 72 hours. Idarubicin was given at three dose levels: 6, 9, and 12 mg/m2 intravenously (I.V.) on days 0, 1, and 2. The phase II portion of the trial included 10 additional patients with relapsed or refractory AML. RESULTS: A dose of idarubicin 12 mg/m2/d for 3 days given in combination with fludarabine and cytarabine was tolerated. The major toxicity encountered was hematologic. Nonhematologic toxicities included transaminase elevations, hyperbilirubinemia, and infections. Eight of 10 patients with AML in the phase II portion (12 mg/m2 idarubicin) achieved a complete remission (CR). CONCLUSION: This combination is active in patients with relapsed or refractory AML. The major toxicity encountered is hematologic. This regimen may be useful therapy for AML and should be compared with standard induction therapy in children with newly diagnosed AML.","['Dinndorf, P A', 'Avramis, V I', 'Wiersma, S', 'Krailo, M D', 'Liu-Mares, W', 'Seibel, N L', 'Sato, J K', 'Mosher, R B', 'Kelleher, J F', 'Reaman, G H']","['Dinndorf PA', 'Avramis VI', 'Wiersma S', 'Krailo MD', 'Liu-Mares W', 'Seibel NL', 'Sato JK', 'Mosher RB', 'Kelleher JF', 'Reaman GH']","[""Children's National Medical Center, Washington, DC, USA. pdinndor@cnmc.org""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Controlled Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Infant', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/adverse effects/analogs & derivatives']",1997/08/01 00:00,1997/08/01 00:01,['1997/08/01 00:00'],"['1997/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1997.15.8.2780 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1997 Aug;15(8):2780-5. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1997.15.8.2780.,,,"['R25 CA092049/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01-57746/PHS HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

TFEC shares a closely related bHLH/LZ structure with microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) and TFE3. In the course of cDNA cloning for a factor structurally related to MITF which is also a regulator for cell differentiation, we have isolated cDNA clones from a THP-1 human monocytic leukemia cell line. These cDNAs encode a protein of 347 amino acids, termed TFECL, a human homolog of a putative rat TFEC isoform. TFECL contains an acidic domain that corresponds to a transcriptional activation domain of TFE3 but its equivalent region is deleted in rat TFEC. We explored a function of TFECL using a melanocyte-specific tyrosinase gene and a ubiquitously expressed heme oxygenase-1 gene, each promoter containing the cis-acting CANNTG motifs. By transient coexpression assays, we showed that TFECL is able to activate or inhibit transcription of a reporter gene linked to either the tyrosinase or the heme oxygenase-1 gene promoter, depending on cell types. These results suggest that TFECL may function as a transcriptional activator under certain conditions.","['Yasumoto, K', 'Shibahara, S']","['Yasumoto K', 'Shibahara S']","['Department of Applied Physiology and Molecular Biology, Tohoku University School of Medicine, Sendai, Miyagi, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MITF protein, human)', '0 (Microphthalmia-Associated Transcription Factor)', '0 (TFE3 protein, human)', '0 (TFEC protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA, Complementary/*genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Microphthalmia-Associated Transcription Factor', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/07/17 00:00,1997/07/17 00:01,['1997/07/17 00:00'],"['1997/07/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/07/17 00:01 [medline]', '1997/07/17 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0167-4781(97)00034-1 [pii]', '10.1016/s0167-4781(97)00034-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1997 Jul 17;1353(1):23-31. doi: 10.1016/s0167-4781(97)00034-1.,,,,,,,['GENBANK/D43945'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Predominance of these cells in the decidua and their reduced lytic activity suggest that regulation of their killing activity could be important for the survival of the fetus. It has therefore been hypothesized that the embryo was regulating NK lytic activity. To test this hypothesis, human and rabbit lymphocytes were cultured with various concentrations of interleukin-2. Their ability to kill 51Cr-labelled NK and lymphokine-activated killer (LAK)-sensitive targets was assessed in the presence of rabbit blastocoelic fluid taken at day-12 of pregnancy (BF D-12). BF D-12 dramatically suppressed the killing activity of NK and LAK cells. This effect was observed on K562 (NK-sensitive targets), P815 cells (LAK-sensitive targets), and freshly isolated cells in rabbit trophoblastic cell preparation. Elimination of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), but not transforming growth factor beta 2 (TGF beta 2) or 6 keto prostaglandin F1 alpha (6KPGF 1 alpha), by affinity chromatography, completely abolished BF biological activity. These findings clearly suggest that PGE2 in BF regulates the killing activity of NK and LAK cells, and that the semiallograft embryo plays an active role in its own protection. To our knowledge, it is the first demonstration that PGE2 from the embryo inhibits NK and LAK cell lytic activity.","['Bergeron, D', 'Ouellette, M J', 'Lambert, R D']","['Bergeron D', 'Ouellette MJ', 'Lambert RD']","['Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Laval University, CHUL Research Center, Ste-Foy, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Ireland,J Reprod Immunol,Journal of reproductive immunology,8001906,"['0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', 'K7Q1JQR04M (Dinoprostone)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blastocyst/*metabolism/*physiology', 'Body Fluids/metabolism/physiology', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/drug effects', 'Dinoprostone/analysis/*physiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Lymphokine-Activated/drug effects/*immunology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/drug effects/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects', 'Mast-Cell Sarcoma', 'Mice', 'Pregnancy', 'Rabbits', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/analysis/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/07/01 00:00,1997/07/01 00:01,['1997/07/01 00:00'],"['1997/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0165037897000193 [pii]', '10.1016/s0165-0378(97)00019-3 [doi]']",ppublish,J Reprod Immunol. 1997 Jul;33(3):203-19. doi: 10.1016/s0165-0378(97)00019-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the effect of progestin on the transcriptional regulation of the LIF promoter has not been studied so far. In the present study, we used a luciferase reporter plasmid bearing 666 bp of the human LIF promoter (hLIF666-Luc) to investigate the effects of progestin on the transcriptional regulation of LIF in SKUT-1B uterine tumor cells. Jurkat T-lymphoma cells were used for comparison. Since both cell lines are devoid of functional progesterone receptors (PR), we co-transfected the cells with hLIF666-Luc and an expression vector for the human PR form B (PR-B) or A (PR-A). Addition of the progesterone agonist MPA (medroxy-progesterone acetate, 2.5 x 10(-7) M) resulted in induction of LIF transcription only in SKUT-1B cells, while it had no effect in Jurkat cells. Both PR forms were effective in inducing the LIF promoter in SKUT-1B cells when activated by MPA. However, the induction through PR-A was inhibited more efficiently by the progestin antagonist RU 486. We next investigated the stimulatory effect of MPA in SKUT-1B cells on deletion constructs (h274LIF-Luc, h148LIF-Luc and H82LIF-Luc) and found that it is maintained on these fragments. Thus, 82 bp are sufficient to mediate this effect.

Specific CTL responses against leukemia-associated antigens may be generated using leukemic cells modified to coexpress costimulatory molecules identical to professional antigen-presenting cells. Donor-derived T cells recognizing such antigens may be used in the context of allogeneic SCT to induce complete and sustained remissions, also in patients with leukemia refractory to chemotherapy.

The therapeutic effect of immune T cells is quantitative. As the dose of effector T cells is increased, survival is proportionately increased. Therefore, effective T-cell therapy is predicated on the ability to procure large numbers of immune effector T cells. By using cultured T cells, the number of immune T cells can be increased in vivo substantially above the level achievable by vaccination. The survival of cultured T cells in vivo is dependent upon both the culture conditions used and the therapeutic regimens employed. Under appropriate conditions, cultured T cells can proliferate in vivo in response to stimulation by antigen, distribute widely and survive long term to provide effector function and immunologic memory. Given that T cells recognize peptides, the need for immunization with tumor can be circumvented by immunization with peptide. Peptide-specific T cells and the progeny of single T-cell clones can provide the necessary cellular functions to eradicate disseminated murine leukemia. The ability of cloned T cells to similarly provide substantial measurable immunity in humans has been validated in clinical trials. By priming with peptides and by using established culture conditions, T-cell therapy can now be directed against virtually any antigen within the host T-cell repertoire. The major remaining question to be answered is which proteins and which peptides are the most suitable targets for T-cell therapy trials.","['Cheever, M A', 'Chen, W']","['Cheever MA', 'Chen W']","['Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle 98195-6527, USA. mcheever@u.washington.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",England,Immunol Rev,Immunological reviews,7702118,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/*methods', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*immunology/*therapy', 'T-Lymphocytes/*transplantation']",1997/06/01 00:00,1997/06/01 00:01,['1997/06/01 00:00'],"['1997/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1600-065x.1997.tb00982.x [doi]'],ppublish,Immunol Rev. 1997 Jun;157:177-94. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-065x.1997.tb00982.x.,56,,['R37 CA30558/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nonetheless, the results of clinical BMT reveal that the selection of MHC-identical donors' bone marrow (BM) is no guarantee for avoiding GVHD or ensuring disease-free survival even when donor and recipient are closely related. It is believed that non-MHC-encoded so-called minor histocompatibility antigens (mHag) are involved in both graft-versus-host and graft-versus-leukemia activities. The recent new insights into the chemical nature of mHag not only reveal their physiological function but, more importantly, provide insights into their role in BMT. Together with the information on the human mHag genetics and tissue distribution gathered in the past, we may now apply this knowledge to the benefit of human BMT. Directly relevant is the utility of mHag molecular typing for diagnostics in BM donor selection.

Aerosolized pentamidine is probably the best alternative considering its similar results in primary prophylaxis for patients with a CD4 count > or = 100/mm3. Dapsone, associated with pyrimethamine for toxoplasmosis prevention, and atovaquone represent other possible alternatives. Such a prevention is absolutely necessary for HIV patients with a previous history of pneumocystosis or with less than 200 CD4/mm3. Moreover, children with SCID or acute leukemia as well as patients with renal or heart-lung transplantation would benefit from pneumocystosis prophylaxis. The frequency of relapses of visceral leishmaniasis also justifies a secondary prophylaxis. Because of its efficacy on P. carinii, intravenous pentamidine could be considered the drug of choice. However preliminary studies have indicated the value of liposomal amphotericin B (1 mg/kg twice a month) in this setting. Finally, cryptosporidiosis and microsporidiosis would benefit from secondary prophylaxis. However, since first line therapy is not well established, further studies are needed to precisely determine which drug could be of value.","['Hennequin, C']",['Hennequin C'],"['Service de Microbiologie, Hopital Necker, Paris.']",['fre'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",France,Ann Med Interne (Paris),Annales de medecine interne,0171744,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cryptosporidiosis/prevention & control', 'Humans', '*Immunocompromised Host', 'Leishmaniasis/prevention & control', 'Microsporidiosis/prevention & control', 'Parasitic Diseases/*prevention & control', 'Pneumocystis Infections/prevention & control']",1997/01/01 00:00,1997/01/01 00:01,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Ann Med Interne (Paris). 1997;148(3):240-5.,44,,,,,Prophylaxie des infections parasitaires (toxoplasmose exclue) chez les patients immunodeprimes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cladribine Study Group.,146-53,"Cladribine (2-chlorodeoxyadenosine;) is a purine analogue with clinical activity against hairy cell leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia and indolent lymphoma. To clarify the toxicity profiles of cladribine, we conducted a phase I and pharmacological study of cladribine with a schedule of seven-day continuous intravenous infusion every 28 days up to a maximum of three cycles. We enrolled 10 previously-treated patients with various lymphoid malignancies. No dose-limiting toxicity (grade 4 hematologic and/or grade 3 or more non-hematologic) was observed in the three patients who received 0.06 mg/kg/day (Level 1). Of the seven patients who received 0.09 mg/kg/day (Level 2), one patient developed grade 4 hypoxemia and grade 4 thrombocytopenia, and another developed grade 4 neutropenia. Of the seven patients treated at Level 2, one with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma attained complete remission, and one with mantle cell lymphoma, one with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and one with adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma attained partial remission. A pharmacokinetic analysis of the seven patients without leukemic cells showed that their area under the concentration versus time curves of plasma cladribine increased dose-dependently from 2661.3 +/- 300.4 nM x h at Level 1 (n = 3) to 3411.3 +/- 341.0 nM x h at Level 2 (n = 4) (P = 0.034). We conclude that the recommended phase II dose of cladribine (0.09 mg/kg/day as a seven-day continuous i.v. infusion) in Caucasian patients can be safely administered to Japanese patients. The encouraging results prompted us to plan subsequent phase II studies of cladribine against adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma, hairy cell leukemia and indolent lymphoma.","['Tobinai, K', 'Ogura, M', 'Hotta, T', 'Kobayashi, Y', 'Narabayashi, M', 'Suzuki, R', 'Kinoshita, T', 'Kozuru, M', 'Uike, N', 'Ohashi, Y']","['Tobinai K', 'Ogura M', 'Hotta T', 'Kobayashi Y', 'Narabayashi M', 'Suzuki R', 'Kinoshita T', 'Kozuru M', 'Uike N', 'Ohashi Y']","['Department of Medical Oncology, National Cancer Center Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Jpn J Clin Oncol,Japanese journal of clinical oncology,0313225,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics', 'Cladribine/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell, Cutaneous/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutropenia/chemically induced', 'Thrombocytopenia/chemically induced']",1997/06/01 00:00,1997/06/01 00:01,['1997/06/01 00:00'],"['1997/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/jjco/27.3.146 [doi]'],ppublish,Jpn J Clin Oncol. 1997 Jun;27(3):146-53. doi: 10.1093/jjco/27.3.146.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The incidence of adult T-cell leukemia was calculated from the difference between Kyushu and the rest of Japan in mortality from malignant lymphoid neoplasms, i.e., Kyushu's excess rate was assumed to be due to adult T-cell leukemia. In Kyushu, average annual adult T-cell leukemia cases aged > or = 20 years were estimated for men as 252 during the period 1983-87 and 341 during 1988-92, and for women as 201 and 246 respectively. The age-adjusted mortality rate tended to be higher in the latter period [6.29 per 100000 (95% confidence interval 5.59-7.00) vs. 5.25 (4.60-5.90) in men, and 3.33 (2.85-3.80) vs. 3.18 (2.71-3.66) in women]. By contrast, the registered number of adult T-cell leukemia cases nationwide during 1988-93 was only 35% (203/587) of the estimated number, and the number of registered versus estimated cases decreased with age, especially when cases were > 60 years old. In conclusion, the estimated adult T-cell leukemia incidence for 1983-92 increased in the latter half of the period. The estimation suggests that 65% of adult T-cell leukemia cases might be missed by a nationwide survey, and older cases were more likely than younger ones to be missed.","['Takezaki, T', 'Hirose, K', 'Hamajima, N', 'Kuroishi, T', 'Tajima, K']","['Takezaki T', 'Hirose K', 'Hamajima N', 'Kuroishi T', 'Tajima K']","['Division of Epidemiology, Aichi Cancer Center Research Institute, Nagoya, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Jpn J Clin Oncol,Japanese journal of clinical oncology,0313225,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Data Collection', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Japan/epidemiology', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*epidemiology/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Probability', 'Registries', 'Vital Statistics']",1997/06/01 00:00,1997/06/01 00:01,['1997/06/01 00:00'],"['1997/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/jjco/27.3.140 [doi]'],ppublish,Jpn J Clin Oncol. 1997 Jun;27(3):140-5. doi: 10.1093/jjco/27.3.140.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, previous studies may have overestimated the numbers of patient-years of risk by not excluding data from ""positive-risk-factor"" patients. This risk was reanalyzed by using data on children in the National Cooperative Growth Study (NCGS), with correction for this possible confounding factor. METHODS: The risk of leukemia in GH-treated patients without known risk factors was determined by using patient-years of GH therapy and patient-years since first exposure to GH therapy and the values obtained were compared with values from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program of the National Cancer Institute. RESULTS: Three cases of leukemia in patients without known risk factors were found in the NCGS database; 3.42 cases would be expected in the 119,846 patient-years in the analysis using time since GH exposure. Two of these cases of leukemia occurred during GH therapy (67,773 patient-years); 2.13 cases would be expected. CONCLUSION: Excluding data on patients with known risk factors for leukemia provides a more accurate estimate of the risks in GH-treated patients. The incidence of leukemia in these patients is comparable to that in the general population of age-matched children.","['Allen, D B', 'Rundle, A C', 'Graves, D A', 'Blethen, S L']","['Allen DB', 'Rundle AC', 'Graves DA', 'Blethen SL']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Wisconsin Medical School, Madison, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Pediatr,The Journal of pediatrics,0375410,['12629-01-5 (Human Growth Hormone)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Confounding Factors, Epidemiologic', 'Female', 'Human Growth Hormone/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Information Systems', 'Leukemia/*chemically induced', 'Male', 'National Institutes of Health (U.S.)', 'Risk Factors', 'SEER Program', 'Time Factors', 'United States']",1997/07/01 00:00,1997/07/01 00:01,['1997/07/01 00:00'],"['1997/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['a81746 [pii]', '10.1016/s0022-3476(97)70008-8 [doi]']",ppublish,J Pediatr. 1997 Jul;131(1 Pt 2):S32-6. doi: 10.1016/s0022-3476(97)70008-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recombinant murine LIF was studied by multidimensional homonuclear and 1H-15N heteronuclear NMR and 95% of backbone amide resonances assigned. Definition of the secondary structure by chemical shift data and NOE connectivities shows a four-alpha-helix bundle fold (helices A-D) in solution, with an additional flexible turn of helix in the AB loop. Subtle differences are seen in the conformations of helices A and D from those defined in the crystal structure [Robinson, R. C., Grey, L. M., Staunton, D., Vankelcom, H., Vernallis, A. B., Moreau, J.-F., Stuart, D. I., Heath, J. K., & Jones, E. Y. (1994) Cell77, 1101-1116]. The dynamics of the polypeptide backbone of LIF were assessed from 15N T1 and T2 relaxation times and 15N-1H heteronuclear NOEs of the amide groups. Using model-free formalism, the overall rotational correlation time of LIF in solution is calculated to be 9.7 ps. The four alpha-helices are relatively rigid, and high mobility is observed for N-terminal residues (Ser 1-Asn 21) and the AB loop. In contrast to several closely related cytokines, the long CD loop is relatively rigid. This may have implications for interactions with the specific LIF receptor, which binds in this region.","['Purvis, D H', 'Mabbutt, B C']","['Purvis DH', 'Mabbutt BC']","['School of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of New South Wales, Sydney NSW 2052, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Solutions)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Growth Inhibitors/*chemistry', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*chemistry', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Protein Folding', 'Protein Structure, Secondary', 'Recombinant Proteins/chemistry', 'Solutions']",1997/08/19 00:00,1997/08/19 00:01,['1997/08/19 00:00'],"['1997/08/19 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/08/19 00:01 [medline]', '1997/08/19 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1021/bi970665m [doi]', 'bi970665m [pii]']",ppublish,Biochemistry. 1997 Aug 19;36(33):10146-54. doi: 10.1021/bi970665m.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Exposure of PC12 cells to 6-OHDA resulted in a concentration- and time-dependent cell death, as evidenced by the release of lactate dehydrogenase into the culture medium. Addition of catalase, but not superoxide dismutase, to the culture medium protected PC12 cells from the 6-OHDA-induced toxicity. Interleukin (IL)-6 provided a dose-dependent protection against the 6-OHDA toxicity, as did nerve growth factor (NGF). In addition, basic fibroblast growth factor and dibutyryl cyclic AMP partially protected PC12 cells from 6-OHDA toxicity. Neither IL-1alpha, IL-2, IL-4, transforming growth factor-beta, nor leukemia inhibitory factor had any effect. The protective effect of IL-6 was attenuated by 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole, an inhibitor of catalase. These results suggest that IL-6 may protect PC12 cells against the 6-OHDA toxicity by activating free radical detoxifying mechanisms, such as catalase activity.","['Yamada, K', 'Umegaki, H', 'Maezawa, I', 'Iguchi, A', 'Kameyama, T', 'Nabeshima, T']","['Yamada K', 'Umegaki H', 'Maezawa I', 'Iguchi A', 'Kameyama T', 'Nabeshima T']","['Department of Neuropsychopharmacology and Hospital Pharmacy, Nagoya University School of Medicine, Showa-Ku, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Brain Res Bull,Brain research bulletin,7605818,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Nerve Growth Factors)', '0 (Neuroprotective Agents)', '8HW4YBZ748 (Oxidopamine)', 'EC 1.11.1.6 (Catalase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Catalase/*physiology', 'Cytokines/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-6/*pharmacology', 'Nerve Growth Factors/pharmacology', 'Neuroprotective Agents/*pharmacology', 'Oxidopamine/*poisoning', 'PC12 Cells/*drug effects', 'Rats']",1997/01/01 00:00,1997/01/01 00:01,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0361-9230(96)00336-X [pii]', '10.1016/s0361-9230(96)00336-x [doi]']",ppublish,Brain Res Bull. 1997;43(6):573-7. doi: 10.1016/s0361-9230(96)00336-x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study we have evaluated the significance of bone marrow (BM) histology on the subsequent response to r-IFN therapy, as well as the morphological changes induced by r-IFN within BM. METHODS AND RESULTS: 73 BM biopsies were studied from 21 patients with Ph1-positive CML in chronic phase at diagnosis and at different times during r-IFN treatment. At diagnosis the probability of achieving a major or complete cytogenetic response was significantly higher in patients with a total marrow cellularity lower than 90% (P = 0.02). During therapy with r-IFN, significant BM changes included disappearance of the CML pattern (P = 0.0002), reduction of M:E ratio (P = 0.0009) and total cellularity (P = 0.0027), and increase in number of terminal megakaryocytes (P = 0.0009) and of fatty tissue regeneration (P = 0.037); only after long-term therapy (mean 20 months), did reticulin fibrosis increase significantly (P = 0.032). CONCLUSIONS: The overall BM morphology in response to treatment displayed different pictures, ranging from persistence of CML (25 biopsies out of 51), to reversion to normal histology (14 out of 51). Persistence of diffuse morphological abnormalities was associated with lack of cytogenetic responsiveness (P = 0.025).","['Facchetti, F', 'Tironi, A', 'Marocolo, D', 'Capucci, A', 'Ruggeri, G', 'Bellotti, D', 'Rossi, G']","['Facchetti F', 'Tironi A', 'Marocolo D', 'Capucci A', 'Ruggeri G', 'Bellotti D', 'Rossi G']","['Department of Pathology, Spedali Civili, University of Brescia, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Histopathology,Histopathology,7704136,"['0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Biopsy', 'Bone Marrow/*drug effects/*pathology', 'Bone Marrow Examination', 'Cytogenetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interferon Type I/*therapeutic use', 'Interferon-alpha', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/genetics/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recombinant Proteins']",1997/07/01 00:00,1997/07/01 00:01,['1997/07/01 00:00'],"['1997/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-2559.1997.5700796.x [doi]'],ppublish,Histopathology. 1997 Jul;31(1):3-11. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2559.1997.5700796.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The model employed is based on a clinical in vitro fertilization program in which single human embryos were cocultured with EEC until blastocyst stage and then transferred back to the uterus. After embryo transfer, EEC wells were divided according to the embryonic status reached: EEC with embryos that achieved the blastocyst stage, EEC with arrested embryos, and EEC without embryos. Immunostaining for beta 3 was positive in plasma membrane of EEC. Flow cytometry showed a mean percentage of beta 3-stained cells of 24.1 +/- 5.7 in EEC cocultured with embryos that achieved the blastocyst stage (n = 13) vs. 9.5 +/- 1.6 (P < 0.05) in those EEC cultured with arrested embryos (n = 12). Immunostaining for alpha 1 and alpha 4 integrins was negative in EEC monolayers studied, regardless of the presence or absence of embryos, and these findings were confirmed by flow cytometry. The possibility that the embryonic IL-1 system and leukemia inhibitory factor were involved in the endometrial beta 3 up-regulation was investigated by neutralizing experiments demonstrating a significant inhibition of beta 3-stained cells when EEC monolayers were cultured in the presence of EEC/blastocyst-conditioned media with (n = 4) vs. without (n = 8) antihuman interleukin (IL)-1 alpha + IL-1 beta (1.65% vs. 14.6%; P < 0.05). Dose-response experiments further demonstrated an up-regulation of beta 3 positive cells when IL-1 alpha + IL-1 beta were added to the medium at a concentration of 10 pg/mL compared with control medium without added cytokines (40% vs. 20%, n = 4). The functional relevance of the EEC beta 3 up-regulation was tested using a mouse blastocyst adhesion assay. More mouse blastocysts attached to EEC previously in contact with human blastocyst (72.7%) compared with those EEC previously in contact with arrested embryos (40%). Our results demonstrate the selective effect of a developing human embryo on EEC expression of beta 3, which is maximal when a human blastocyst instead of an arrested embryo is considered. Furthermore, the embryonic IL-1 system seems to be involved in the EEC beta 3 up-regulation, reinforcing the concept of precise paracrine cross-talk between blastocyst and endometrial epithelium during embryonic implantation.","['Simon, C', 'Gimeno, M J', 'Mercader, A', ""O'Connor, J E"", 'Remohi, J', 'Polan, M L', 'Pellicer, A']","['Simon C', 'Gimeno MJ', 'Mercader A', ""O'Connor JE"", 'Remohi J', 'Polan ML', 'Pellicer A']","['Instituto Valenciano de Infertilidad, Valencia University, Spain. ivi@futurnet.es']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Endocrinol Metab,The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,0375362,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (Integrin alpha1)', '0 (Integrin beta3)', '0 (Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins)', '143198-26-9 (Integrin alpha4)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD/analysis/*metabolism', 'Blastocyst/physiology', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Culture Media, Conditioned', 'Embryo Transfer', 'Embryo, Mammalian/*physiology', 'Endometrium/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Epithelium/chemistry/metabolism', 'Female', 'Fertilization in Vitro', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Integrin alpha1', 'Integrin alpha4', 'Integrin beta3', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Electron, Scanning', 'Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins/analysis/*metabolism']",1997/08/01 00:00,1997/08/01 00:01,['1997/08/01 00:00'],"['1997/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1210/jcem.82.8.4153 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Endocrinol Metab. 1997 Aug;82(8):2607-16. doi: 10.1210/jcem.82.8.4153.,,,['HD31575/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The HL-60R cells exhibited a > 10-fold increase in resistance when measured by [3H]-thymidine incorporation in comparison to the HL-60 cell line. ET-18-OCH3 binding occurred at 4 degrees C and was not saturable at the concentrations tested (1-100 microM), indicating that the binding was receptor-independent. At 4 degrees C, association of ET-18-OCH3 was low for each cell line. AT 37 degrees C, uptake in the HL-60 cells was approximately 5-fold greater in comparison to HL-60R cells at each concentration tested. However, when the cellular content of ET-18-OCH3 was equal, both cell lines experienced similar declines in cell growth. Cellular incorporation of ether lipid was determined using serum-free media and in the presence of serum albumin or lipoproteins. Reduced uptake by the resistant cell line was observed only in the presence of albumin. A greater proportion of ether lipid could be removed from prelabeled HL-60R cells than from HL-60 cells, by an albumin wash procedure, indicating an increased rate of internalization and retention by the sensitive cell line. ET-18-OCH3 uptake in the HL-60 cell line was also more sensitive to treatment with endocytic (chloroquine, monensin) or metabolic (NaF, KCN) inhibitors.

In this study we demonstrate that a novel protein, ubiquitin COOH-terminal hydrolase (UCH-L1), is associated with this differentiation. Reh cells were treated with 200 nmol/l of Bryo1 for 72 h and analyzed for changes in morphology, surface immunophenotype, acid phosphatase and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase. Protein patterns of the parent and differentiated cells, by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2D PAGE), were studied. Bryo1-treated cells expressed morphologic, phenotypic and enzymatic features of the monocytoid B-cell stage. The UCH-L1 enzyme (MW-pl 34-5.3) was detected by 2 D PAGE in the differentiated, but not in parent cells. The presence of UCH-L1 in the Bryo1-treated cells was further confirmed by immunoblotting of 2 D PAGE using UCH-L1 polyclonal antibody. Ubiquitin expression was studied in parent and Bryo1-treated cells and was compared with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-treated cells. Both agents, TPA and Bryo1, increased the level of ubiquitin expression as detected by flow cytometry. Sodium borohydride, an inhibitor of UCH-L1, inhibited the Bryo1-induced differentiating effect on Reh cells. To date, the mechanism by which Bryo1, exerts its B-cell differentiating effect is not fully understood. This study shows that UCH-L1 expression may play a major role in Bryo1-induced differentiation in pre-B-ALL.","['Mohammad, R M', 'Maki, A', 'Pettit, G R', 'al-Katib, A M']","['Mohammad RM', 'Maki A', 'Pettit GR', 'al-Katib AM']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, Karmanos Cancer Institute, Wayne State University, Detroit, Mich, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Switzerland,Enzyme Protein,Enzyme & protein,9422761,"['0 (Bryostatins)', '0 (Immune Sera)', '0 (Lactones)', '0 (Macrolides)', '0 (Mitogens)', '37O2X55Y9E (bryostatin 1)', 'EC 3.1.2.- (Thiolester Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.4.19.12 (Ubiquitin Thiolesterase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Animals', 'Bryostatins', 'Cell Division/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional', 'Enzyme Induction/drug effects', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Immune Sera/immunology', 'Immunoblotting', 'Lactones/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*enzymology/pathology', 'Macrolides', 'Mitogens/*pharmacology', 'Rabbits', 'Thiolester Hydrolases/*biosynthesis/drug effects/immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Ubiquitin Thiolesterase']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1159/000468636 [doi]'],ppublish,Enzyme Protein. 1996;49(5-6):262-72. doi: 10.1159/000468636.,,,['1 R29 CA50715/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We sought to characterize how TPO binds and activates its receptor, myeloproliferative leukemia virus receptor. The erythropoietin-like domain of TPO (TPO1-153) has been fused to the gIII coat protein of M13 bacteriophage. Forty residues were chosen for mutation to alanine using the criteria that they were charged residues or predicted to be solvent-exposed, based on a homology model. Phage enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to determine affinities for binding to both the TPO receptor and five anti-TPO1-153 monoclonal antibodies. Mutations at mostly positively charged residues (Asp8, Lys14, Lys52, Lys59, Lys136, Lys138, Arg140) caused the greatest reduction in receptor-binding affinity. Most of these residues mapped to helices-1 and -4 and a loop region between helix-1 and helix-2. Two of the monoclonal antibodies that blocked TPO binding and bioactivity had determinants in helix-4. In contrast, the other three monoclonal antibodies, which were effective at blocking TPO activity but did not block initial binding of TPO to its receptor, had epitopes predominantly on helix or 3. These results suggest that TPO has two distinct receptor-binding sites that function to dimerize TPO receptors in a sequential fashion.","['Pearce, K H Jr', 'Potts, B J', 'Presta, L G', 'Bald, L N', 'Fendly, B M', 'Wells, J A']","['Pearce KH Jr', 'Potts BJ', 'Presta LG', 'Bald LN', 'Fendly BM', 'Wells JA']","['Department of Protein Engineering, Genentech, Inc., South San Francisco, California 94080, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, Thrombopoietin)', '143641-95-6 (MPL protein, human)', '9014-42-0 (Thrombopoietin)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Binding Sites', '*Epitope Mapping', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', '*Neoplasm Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*analysis', '*Receptors, Cytokine', 'Receptors, Thrombopoietin', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Thrombopoietin/*chemistry/immunology/metabolism']",1997/08/15 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1997/08/15 00:00'],"['1997/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1997/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.272.33.20595 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(18)38771-4 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1997 Aug 15;272(33):20595-602. doi: 10.1074/jbc.272.33.20595.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, inflammatory activation of P388D1 macrophages with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and platelet-activating factor (PAF) stimulated a transient accumulation of ceramide. Moreover, cell-permeable ceramide mimicked LPS/PAF in triggering arachidonate mobilization in these cells. LPS/PAF-induced ceramide synthesis did not result from sphingomyelinase activation but from increased de novo synthesis. Participation of this pathway in arachidonate signaling was detected since fumonisin B1, an inhibitor of de novo ceramide synthesis, was able to inhibit the LPS/PAF-induced response. These studies have uncovered a new role for sphingolipid metabolism in cellular signaling and constitute evidence that products of the sphingomyelin biosynthetic pathway may serve a specific role in signal transduction by influencing the activity of the novel Group V secretory phospholipase A2.","['Balsinde, J', 'Balboa, M A', 'Dennis, E A']","['Balsinde J', 'Balboa MA', 'Dennis EA']","['Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, School of Medicine and Revelle College, University of California at San Diego, La Jolla, California 92093-0601, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Carboxylic Acids)', '0 (Diglycerides)', '0 (Fumonisins)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Platelet Activating Factor)', '0 (Sphingomyelins)', '27YG812J1I (Arachidonic Acid)', '3ZZM97XZ32 (fumonisin B1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Arachidonic Acid/*metabolism', 'Carboxylic Acids/pharmacology', 'Diglycerides/biosynthesis', '*Fumonisins', 'Leukemia P388', 'Lipopolysaccharides/pharmacology', 'Macrophages/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Platelet Activating Factor/pharmacology', 'Sphingomyelins/*biosynthesis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/08/15 00:00,1997/08/15 00:01,['1997/08/15 00:00'],"['1997/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1997/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.272.33.20373 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(18)38739-8 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1997 Aug 15;272(33):20373-7. doi: 10.1074/jbc.272.33.20373.,,,"['GM 20501/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'HD 26171/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast, when large T-antigen expression was inhibited by culture at 39 degrees C, the cells did not grow but differentiated into Ito cells as assessed by both morphological and functional characteristics. Expression of the transcription factor SCL (stem cell leukemia), which plays a role in the development and differentiation of blood cells, was observed at both 33 degrees C and 39 degrees C, although expression was greater at 33 degrees C. Therefore, opposite patterns of cell growth and the functions of differentiated cells occurred at 33 degrees C and 39 degrees C in this novel Ito cell line.

A new assay system has revealed a significant contribution of the catalytically dispensible N-terminal region of RAG-1 to recombination activity. The foundation for this system is an Abelson virus-transformed cell line derived from RAG-1(-/-) mice that is dependent on the introduction of exogenous RAG-1 for rearrangement of either plasmid substrates or the endogenous immunoglobulin loci. Use of this line demonstrates that conserved and novel cysteine-containing elements in the N-terminal region are required for full RAG-1 activity when recombination activity is in a RAG-1 dose-responsive range.

The operational device takes the form of a thin chamber in which the bottom wall supports an array of microelectrodes. By applying appropriate AC voltage signals to these electrodes, dielectrophoretic forces are generated to levitate cells suspended in the chamber and to affect their equilibrium heights. A laminar flow profile is established in the chamber so that fluid flows faster with increasing distance from the chamber walls. A cell carried in the flow stream will attain an equilibrium height, and a corresponding velocity, based on the balance of dielectrophoretic, gravitational, and hydrodynamic lift forces it experiences. We describe a theoretical model for this system and show that the cell velocity is a function of the mean fluid velocity, the voltage and frequency of the signals applied to the electrodes, and, most significantly, the cell dielectric properties.

Concurrently, severe leukemia-related gastrointestinal complications have become more common. METHODS: We evaluated the findings of the abdominal ultrasound (US) examinations of 52 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who had severe clinical symptoms indicating infection or abdominal complication during chemotherapy treatment or after the cessation of such treatment and assessed the impact of these findings on patients' subsequent treatment and survival. RESULTS: Our study presents ten cases of typhlitis with a prevalence of 9%, all of which were rapidly diagnosed by US and had a favourable outcome. We also found focal intra-abdominal parenchymal lesions in six children, five of them due to fungal infection and one due to leukemic infiltration. Several other intra-abdominal pathologies significant for the patients' treatment are also reported. DISCUSSION: We believe that abdominal US is a useful, rapid, safe, and accurate imaging method for children with ALL suspected to suffer from leukemia- or chemotherapy-related gastrointestinal complications. More invasive imaging methods are seldom needed. CONCLUSIONS: According to our results, abdominal US gives the necessary information in most of the cases and provides prompt diagnosis, which may prevent possible fatal complications.","['Ojala, A E', 'Lanning, F P', 'Lanning, B M']","['Ojala AE', 'Lanning FP', 'Lanning BM']","['Department of Diagnostic Radiology, University of Oulu, Finland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Med Pediatr Oncol,Medical and pediatric oncology,7506654,,IM,"['Abdomen/*diagnostic imaging', 'Adolescent', 'Cecal Diseases/chemically induced/diagnostic imaging/etiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Gastrointestinal Diseases/chemically induced/diagnostic imaging/etiology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Inflammation', 'Male', 'Pancreatitis/chemically induced/diagnostic imaging/etiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/diagnostic imaging/*therapy', 'Ultrasonography']",1997/10/01 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1997/10/01 00:00'],"['1997/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1997/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1096-911X(199710)29:4<266::AID-MPO6>3.0.CO;2-K [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1096-911x(199710)29:4<266::aid-mpo6>3.0.co;2-k [doi]']",ppublish,Med Pediatr Oncol. 1997 Oct;29(4):266-71. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1096-911x(199710)29:4<266::aid-mpo6>3.0.co;2-k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Salvage regimens used to date have met limited success. We describe two cases of relapsed infant ALL who have achieved long-term survival with an intensive antimetabolite-based salvage regimen. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two consecutive infants with relapsed ALL presented at our institution and were treated with an antimetabolite-based regimen. Both cases exhibited clinical and biological phenotypes previously associated with infantile ALL. RESULTS: Both patients have achieved prolonged and sustained remissions 48 and 30 months EFS respectively following therapy with intensive antimetabolite-based salvage regimen. CONCLUSIONS: An intensive multiagent antimetabolite based salvage regimen resulted in prolonged EFS in two cases of relapsed infant ALL. Dose intensification was achieved by administering repeated cycles of the same treatment schema using high dose chemotherapy throughout therapy. These infants were spared prophylactic cranial irradiation without a negative impact on outcome. The use of L-asparaginase, timed after high-dose Cytarabine (ARA-C) throughout therapy, might have contributed to their cure.","['Barredo, J C', 'Yusuf, U', 'Abboud, M', 'Laver, J']","['Barredo JC', 'Yusuf U', 'Abboud M', 'Laver J']","['Division of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC), Charleston, USA. barredjc@musc.edu']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Med Pediatr Oncol,Medical and pediatric oncology,7506654,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Remission Induction']",1997/10/01 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1997/10/01 00:00'],"['1997/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1997/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1096-911X(199710)29:4<256::AID-MPO4>3.0.CO;2-L [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1096-911x(199710)29:4<256::aid-mpo4>3.0.co;2-l [doi]']",ppublish,Med Pediatr Oncol. 1997 Oct;29(4):256-9. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1096-911x(199710)29:4<256::aid-mpo4>3.0.co;2-l.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A major metabolic route is catalysed by thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT). TPMT deficiency occurs in 1 in 300 individuals and results in high concentrations of thioguanine nucleotides (TGNs), cytotoxic 6MP metabolites. A leukaemic child taking 6MP repeatedly developed profound pancytopenias. TPMT deficiency was confirmed. TGN formation was then studied on attenuated 6MP dosages. Four weekly oral doses of 75 mg/m2 6MP produced TGNs of 2348 pmol/8 x 10(8) red cells, nearly double the maximum TGNs recorded in ALL children with TPMT activity taking long term daily 75 mg/m2 6MP. Grossly elevated TGN concentrations were also produced at 10% standard 6MP dosage (7.5 mg/m2 daily), accompanied by unacceptable 6MP toxicity (neutropenia, diarrhoea, vomiting). The child was eventually stabilised on 10% alternate day therapy and after 15 weeks TGNs were 1670 pmol, just above the upper end of the TGN range for ALL children with TPMT activity.","['Lennard, L', 'Lewis, I J', 'Michelagnoli, M', 'Lilleyman, J S']","['Lennard L', 'Lewis IJ', 'Michelagnoli M', 'Lilleyman JS']","['Department of Medicine and Pharmacology, Royal Hallamshire Hospital, Sheffield, U.K.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Med Pediatr Oncol,Medical and pediatric oncology,7506654,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Guanine Nucleotides)', '0 (Thionucleotides)', '15867-02-4 (6-thioguanylic acid)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.67 (thiopurine methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Child', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Erythrocytes/metabolism', 'Female', 'Guanine Nucleotides/blood', 'Humans', 'Mercaptopurine/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Methyltransferases/*deficiency', 'Neutropenia/chemically induced', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/*drug therapy/enzymology', 'Thionucleotides/blood', 'Thrombocytopenia/chemically induced']",1997/10/01 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1997/10/01 00:00'],"['1997/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1997/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1096-911X(199710)29:4<252::AID-MPO3>3.0.CO;2-L [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1096-911x(199710)29:4<252::aid-mpo3>3.0.co;2-l [doi]']",ppublish,Med Pediatr Oncol. 1997 Oct;29(4):252-5. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1096-911x(199710)29:4<252::aid-mpo3>3.0.co;2-l.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They can be transferred from donor to recipient embryos and contribute to both somatic tissues and the germline. Blastodermal cells that have been maintained in culture for 7 d express the epitopes ECMA-7 and SSEA-1, which are also expressed by mouse embryonic stem cells. After culture for up to at least 7 d, blastodermal cells retain the ability to differentiate into somatic tissues and the germline both in vivo and in vitro. Proliferation in the absence of differentiation of blastodermal cells is stimulated by the presence of Leukemia Inhibitory Factor (LIF) and other ligands that interact with the gp130 receptor, and differentiation is stimulated by exposure to retinoic acid. Blastodermal cells also possess high levels of telomerase activity, which is shared by immortalized cells and cells within the germline.

This has been studied most extensively in patients with liver-only colorectal metastases. Four large randomized studies have failed to demonstrate a survival advantage of regional treatment over systemic chemotherapy, although two meta-analyses confirmed an improvement in response rate and suggest a trend toward improvement in survival. Two randomized studies have shown improved survival in patients treated with HIA chemotherapy, as compared with those given supportive care, and quality of life also appears to be superior in HIA chemotherapy recipients. The treatment employed in all of the randomized studies was hindered by substantial hepatobiliary toxicity and many surgical complications. Improved surgical techniques and newer chemotherapy combinations appear to have improved phase II results with HIA therapy, leading to a randomized trial now being conducted by the Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB). The role of HIA chemotherapy in adjuvant settings and in other diseases has not been as well-studied, and such uses remain appropriate only for very selected patients. Ultimately, the regional advantage gained by the HIA route may prove to be most advantageous for the delivery of newer biologic agents.","['Venook, A P']",['Venook AP'],"['Division of Hematology and Oncology, University of California, San Francisco, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Oncology (Williston Park),"Oncology (Williston Park, N.Y.)",8712059,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/*pathology', '*Hepatic Artery', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Intra-Arterial', 'Liver Neoplasms/*drug therapy/*secondary', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic']",1997/07/01 00:00,1997/07/01 00:01,['1997/07/01 00:00'],"['1997/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['175899 [pii]'],ppublish,"Oncology (Williston Park). 1997 Jul;11(7):947-57; discussion 961-2, 964, 970.",51,,,"['Oncology (Williston Park). 1997 Oct;11(10):1446, 1449.

In the early clinical stage, the endoscopic findings for the intestine were similar to those of amebic enterocolitis, i.e., varioliform mucosal polypoid lesions, and amebic cyst was detected with stool examination. Although no specific pathological factor could be identified on biopsy, the patient was treated for amebiasis as a diagnostic therapy. The findings of varioliform mucosal polypoid lesions were detected in the duodenum on endoscopic examination, but the lesions eventually disappeared during the treatment for amebiasis. We then suspected lymphoma partially masked by the amebiasis. Immunological staining of a specimen of the colonic mucosa revealed T cell invasion and Southern blotting demonstrated adult T-cell leukemia provirus invasion. Thus, ATL cell infiltration of the intestinal tract was confirmed.

The major primary causes of death were pneumonitis (n = 38, 47%), GVHD (n = 18, 22%), and sepsis (n = 11, 14%). Pneumonitis contributed to 42 of the deaths (52%), and its etiology was infective (n = 27), idiopathic (n = 14), or a combination of the two (n = 1). On multivariate analysis, GVHD prophylaxis with cyclosporine alone was associated with a higher overall toxic death rate. The use of cyclosporine alone and a low infused cell dose (<2.5 x 10(8) total nucleated cells/kg or <0.6 x 10(8) mononuclear cells/kg) were associated with a higher risk of death from pneumonitis. We conclude that the use of cyclosporine alone as GVHD prophylaxis is associated with increased transplant-related toxicity, and the addition of methotrexate and infusion of a higher number of cells decrease the incidence of fatal pneumonitis.","['Hjiyiannakis, P', 'Mehta, J', 'Milan, S', 'Powles, R', 'Hinson, J', 'Tait, D']","['Hjiyiannakis P', 'Mehta J', 'Milan S', 'Powles R', 'Hinson J', 'Tait D']","['Department of Clinical Oncology, Royal Marsden NHS Trust, Sutton, Surrey, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', 'Q41OR9510P (Melphalan)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*adverse effects/immunology/methods', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology/mortality', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*therapy', 'Lung Diseases, Interstitial/etiology/mortality', 'Male', 'Melphalan/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*therapy', 'Sepsis/etiology/mortality', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*adverse effects/methods', 'Whole-Body Irradiation/*adverse effects']",1997/05/01 00:00,1997/05/01 00:01,['1997/05/01 00:00'],"['1997/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199709039045 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1997 May;25(5-6):565-72. doi: 10.3109/10428199709039045.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus this rearrangement appears to be very rare in B-CLL and its finding should lead to a careful search for the characteristic features of MZL, namely, morphology, the expression of CD5 without CD23, high density monotypic SIg, together with t(11;14) and/or bcl-1/IgH rearrangement.","['Brizard, F', 'Dreyfus, B', 'Guilhot, F', 'Tanzer, J', 'Brizard, A']","['Brizard F', 'Dreyfus B', 'Guilhot F', 'Tanzer J', 'Brizard A']","['Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, University Hospital, Poitiers, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14', 'Evaluation Studies as Topic', 'Female', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Translocation, Genetic']",1997/05/01 00:00,1997/05/01 00:01,['1997/05/01 00:00'],"['1997/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199709039042 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1997 May;25(5-6):539-43. doi: 10.3109/10428199709039042.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The objectives of this study were to assess the 50% lethal dose (LD50) and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) in Balb/c mice of four anti-cCLLa immunotoxins (ITs) derived from the intact monoclonal antibody (MoAb) or its Fab fraction, each conjugated to either ricin chain-A (RTA) or its deglycosylated derivative (dgA). The IgG fraction of anti-cCLLa monoclonal antibody CLL2m and its Fab fraction were conjugated to RTA or dgA to generate four ITs: IgG/RTA, IgG/dgA, Fab/RTA and Fab/dgA. Progressive concentrations of each IT (ranging between 2.60 mg/kg and 100.00 mg/kg) were injected intravenously into groups of 5 mice each. After injection, mice were monitored daily for 10 days for survival. Observed mortality data in each group were matched to those in Weil's tables for estimating LD50 (mg/kg) from the moving average interpolation method. Estimated LD50 (in mg/kg) were: IgG/RTA, 13.33; Fab/RTA, 25.53; IgG/dgA, 55.33; Fab/dgA, 55.33. Their respective MTD (mg/kg), defined as the highest dose level survived by all mice, were 8.78, 13.17, 29.63 and 29.63. Depending on the animal-to-human extrapolation method used, the calculated LD50 and MTD in humans ranged from 1.2 mg/kg and 0.8 mg/kg (IgG/RTA), to 55.6 mg/kg and 36.9 mg/kg (IgG/dgA and Fab/dgA), respectively. The following conclusions are drawn. 1. Antibody valence exerted little influence on either the LD50 or the MTD; 2. The LD50 to MTD ratios were approximately 2:1; 3. dgA-derived ITs were approximately one half as toxic as their RTA-derived counterparts; and 4. Extrapolation of LD50 and MTD mouse data to humans resulted in dose levels comparable to or exceeding those reported in most IT human trials. These data suggest the suitability of anti-cCLLa ITs for clinical immunotherapy trials.","['Faguet, G B', 'Agee, J F']","['Faguet GB', 'Agee JF']","['Department of Medicine, Medical College of Georgia, VA Medical Center, Augusta 30910, USA.

Exposure of Farage cells, derived from a human B-cell lymphoma, to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) down-regulated CD21 and CD23 expression, while interleukin 4 (IL4) inhibited the expression of CD21 but augmented CD23 expression. When Farage cells were stained with either anti-CD21 or anti-CD23 monoclonal antibodies (mAb), subsequent exposure to IL4 failed to change the staining of the cells, indicating that IL4 did not affect the turnover of CD21 and CD23 molecules. Inhibition of protein synthesis with cycloheximide (CXM) had no effect on the expression of CD21 molecules, but abrogated their down-regulation by IL4, suggesting that IL4 induced the synthesis of proteins which modify the processing of CD21 molecules. The inhibitory effect of IL4 on the expression of CD21 and its augmentary effect on the expression of CD23 was abrogated by H7 (1-(5-Isoquinolinylsulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine), an inhibitor of serine protein kinase. Staurosporine, an additional inhibitor of serine kinases also abrogated the effect of IL4 on CD23 expression. H8 (N-(2-[Methylamino]ethyl)-5-isoquinolinesulfonamide), a preferential inhibitor of protein kinases A and G, and genistein, an inhibitor of tyrosine kinases had no effect on IL4-induced modulation of CD21 and CD23 in Farage cells. The exposure of B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells to PMA reduced the expression of CD21, but increased the expression of CD23. IL4 had no effect on the expression of CD21 on CLL-cells but strongly enhanced the level of CD23. H7, H8 and genistein each abrogated to a different extent the effect of IL4 on the expression of CD23 by CLL-cells. These data indicate that activation of serine/threonine kinases in malignant B cells inhibited the production of CD21 proteins, while different protein kinases appeared to be involved in up- and down-regulation of CD23 in different B lymphocytes.","['Shubinsky, G', 'Schlesinger, M', 'Polliack, A', 'Rabinowitz, R']","['Shubinsky G', 'Schlesinger M', 'Polliack A', 'Rabinowitz R']","['Hubert H.

In order to assess the pharmacokinetics and biodistribution of two potent anti-cCLLa immunotoxins (ITs) were examined in the mouse model. The IgG fraction of anti-cCLLa monoclonal antibody CLL2m was conjugated with 125I-labeled intact (RTA) or deglycosylated (dgA) ricin chain A, injected intravenously into athymic mice engrafted with cCLLa-expressing human tumors, and monitored over 120 hours. Blood concentrations of CLL2m/125I-RTA and CLL2m/125I-dgA were best fit to biexponential equations but the latter exhibited a lower alphaT1/2 and betaT1/2 (4.1 and 102 min vs 5.9 and 126 min), a smaller volume of distribution (5.1 g vs 9.7 g), and a lower blood clearance (2.2 g/hr vs 4.6 g/hr). Both ITs exhibited preferential tumor uptake that followed distinct kinetics: rising tumor uptake for 2 hrs post-injection (while tissue uptake decreased), reaching tumor/non-tumoral tissue uptake ratios up to 16.9; and slower dissociation rates of tumor- vs tissue-bound ITs (>45% vs <20% remaining tissue-bound 6 hrs post-injection, respectively). Non-specific liver uptake was not prominent for either IT. In vivo IT deconjugation reached 50% approximately 12 hours pos-injection. The pharmacokinetics and biodistribution data in the mouse model suggest that ricin-based anti-cCLLa ITs are suitable for use in human trials.","['Faguet, G B', 'Agee, J F']","['Faguet GB', 'Agee JF']","['Department of Medicine, Medical College of Georgia, VA Medical Center, Augusta 30910, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Immunotoxins)', '0 (Iodine Radioisotopes)', '0 (common chronic lymphatic leukemia antigen gp69, human)', '9009-86-3 (Ricin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*immunology', 'Autoradiography', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/methods', 'Immunotoxins/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use/urine', 'Iodine Radioisotopes', 'Kidney/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/*metabolism/*therapy', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Ricin/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use/urine', 'Tissue Distribution', 'Transplantation, Heterologous']",1997/05/01 00:00,1997/05/01 00:01,['1997/05/01 00:00'],"['1997/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199709039039 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1997 May;25(5-6):509-20. doi: 10.3109/10428199709039039.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A crossover study on the prophylactic effect of GM-CSF therapy on neutropenia was carried out in 12 patients with advanced CLL. The patients received GM-CSF in association with every second cycle of COP (cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisone) chemotherapy. A total of 40 COP cycles were analyzed. Blood neutrophil levels were significantly higher two to three weeks after the first COP cycle followed by GM-CSF (medians 2.24 and 5.47 x 10(9)/l) when compared to the first cycle without GM-CSF support (0.59 and 0.75 x 10(9)/l; p < 0.0195 and <0.002, respectively).

Median time to 0.5 x 10(9)/L neutrophils and 50 x 10(9)/L platelets was 38 and 51 days respectively. Myeloid engraftment was significantly slower compared with ALL patients receiving unpurged marrow (P = .01). Eight patients died due to transplant-related causes 53-205 days after the procedure. Six of eight patients receiving 1150 cGy TBI died of toxicity compared with two of 15 receiving less than 1150 cGy (P = .006, Fisher's exact test). Nine patients relapsed at 45-195 days (median 97); eight died and one is alive at nine years in a chemotherapy-induced remission.

Wt-1 has been shown to be expressed in blast cells of the vast majority of patients with acute myeloid and lymphoblastic leukemias (AL) by a number of workers. High levels of wt-1 mRNA expression in blast cells of newly diagnosed AML patients predict worse prognosis when compared to patients with no or low wt-1 mRNA expression. Patients achieving complete responses after chemotherapy usually lose detectable signals of wt-1. In relapse of the disease reoccurrence of wt-1 mRNA can be determined in almost all patients with initially detectable wt-1 mRNA. Using sensitive techniques such as reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) relapses are preceded by wt-1 expression in some cases. Although a subpopulation of normal hematopoietic precursor cells has also been shown to express message for wt-1, detectable levels of wt-1 during follow-ups in AML patients have been shown to be useful as a marker for residual blast populations or even to predict relapse of AML. Whether the high level of wt- expression is a non-specific phenomenon resulting from malignant transformation or whether it has an impact on the pathophysiology of AML or the uncontrolled growth of AML blasts is still controversial. However, there are indicators for an involvement of wt-1 in malignant events of AML blasts such as the downregulation of wt-1 in chemically induced differentiation of AML blast cell lines or the interactions of wt-1 with the protooncogene bcl-2 and the tumor suppressor gene p53. In conclusion, its possible relevance as an AML marker and its role in pathophysiological mechanisms in AML will still have to be defined in the future.","['Bergmann, L', 'Maurer, U', 'Weidmann, E']","['Bergmann L', 'Maurer U', 'Weidmann E']","['Medical Clinic III, Hematology/Oncology, J.W.

Nevertheless, despite an initial good response, most patients who received continuous treatment with all-trans RA relapsed and develop RA-resistant disease. The detailed mechanisms for this development of RA resistance by APL cells are still unclear. Several possible mechanisms have been considered to explain in vitro resistance to RA. One obvious explanation is the generation of new mutations in the retinoid receptors. However, UF-1 cells (the first permanent APL cell line with RA-resistant features) had no point mutations in the ligand-binding domain of the RAR-alpha gene. Another potential mechanism for clinical RA resistance is the pharmacologic alteration in the metabolism of all-trans RA. Continuous treatment with all-trans RA in APL is associated with a progressive reduction of the plasma concentrations of RA. Induction of cytochrome P-450, cellular RA-binding protein (CRABP) and P-glycoprotein resulted in lower plasma and cellular levels of active retinoids. Thus, acquired resistance to RA may be explained at least in part by drug metabolism in leukemic cells.","['Kizaki, M', 'Ueno, H', 'Matsushita, H', 'Takayama, N', 'Muto, A', 'Awaya, N', 'Ikeda, Y']","['Kizaki M', 'Ueno H', 'Matsushita H', 'Takayama N', 'Muto A', 'Awaya N', 'Ikeda Y']","['Division of Hematology, Keio University School of Medicine, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology']",1997/05/01 00:00,1997/05/01 00:01,['1997/05/01 00:00'],"['1997/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199709039029 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1997 May;25(5-6):427-34. doi: 10.3109/10428199709039029.,42,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Leukemic blasts from these patients demonstrated coordinate quantitative expression of glycophorin A and disialosyl-T.

To reduce this risk, we employed granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF, filgrastim 5 microg/kg/d) as an adjunct to a myelotoxic, 14-day long induction regimen with idarubicin-vincristine-L-asparaginase-prednisone (IVAP). Owing to changes in study design, patients received 'late' (n = 28) or 'early' (n = 37) G-CSF from days 15 or 4 of IVAP, respectively, until resolution of severe neutropenia. Study endpoints included time to recovery from neutropenic nadir, duration of neutropenia <0.5 x 10(9)/l, incidence of infectious complications, assessment of variables affecting G-CSF response, clinical outcome and costs. Sixty-five consecutive cases were evaluable. Patients in early G-CSF group recovered significantly faster from the neutropenic nadir (p < 0.002), contracted less infectious complications (p = 0.007), and required less intravenous antibiotic (p = 0.008) and antifungal (p = 0.002) medications. Although these reductions did not compensate for the increased G-CSF treatment cost, the overall supportive care cost was not significantly increased by early G-CSF. Interestingly, T-ALL phenotype (p = 0.02) and higher neutrophil presentation count (p = 0.03) were associated with a shorter neutropenic course even with late G-CSF.

Tretinoin tocoferil also enhances the differentiation of HL-60 cells induced by dimethyl sulfoxide, phorbol ester and 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3(VD3). Tretinoin tocoferil and VD3 synergistically inhibit the proliferation and induce the differentiation of other myelomonocytic leukemia cells.

In particular, leukemias with the t(11;19)(q23;p13.3) translocation express HRX-ENL fusion proteins and display features which suggest the malignant transformation of myeloid and/or lymphoid progenitor(s). To characterize directly the potential transforming effects of HRX-ENL on primitive hematopoietic precursors, the fusion cDNA was transduced by retroviral gene transfer into cell populations enriched in hematopoietic stem cells. The infected cells had a dramatically enhanced potential to generate myeloid colonies with primitive morphology in vitro. Primary colonies could be replated for at least three generations in vitro and established primitive myelomonocytic cell lines upon transfer into suspension cultures supplemented with interleukin-3 and stem cell factor. Immortalized cells contained structurally intact HRX-ENL proviral DNA and expressed a low-level of HRX-ENL mRNA.

The platelet count can be decreased quickly by plasmapheresis, but the effect is transient. Patients with thrombocytosis secondary to a myeloproliferative disease, such as chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), frequently require more sustained suppression of the platelet count. Hydroxyurea, busulfan, and interferon are used to maintain a lower platelet count but are occasionally ineffective or intolerable. An alternative to these therapies is anagrelide, a quinazolin derivative that was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in March 1997. Because current dosing guidelines for anagrelide are scarce, the dosing method of the Anagrelide Study Group that published the largest study to date on the drug's efficacy in thrombocytosis was followed. Two unexpected episodes of anagrelide-induced thrombocytopenia occurred despite following these dosing methods. This prompted a critical evaluation of the pharmacodynamic response and the appropriateness of anagrelide dosage recommendations. A case of thrombocytosis treated with anagrelide in a patient with CML is described.","['McCune, J S', 'Liles, D', 'Lindley, C']","['McCune JS', 'Liles D', 'Lindley C']","['University of North Carolina, School of Pharmacy, Chapel Hill 27599-7360, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Pharmacotherapy,Pharmacotherapy,8111305,"['0 (Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors)', '0 (Quinazolines)', 'K9X45X0051 (anagrelide)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy', 'Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors/*adverse effects', 'Quinazolines/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Thrombocytopenia/*chemically induced']",1997/07/01 00:00,1997/07/01 00:01,['1997/07/01 00:00'],"['1997/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Pharmacotherapy. 1997 Jul-Aug;17(4):822-6.,9,,,['Pharmacotherapy. 1998 May-Jun;18(3):659; discussion 660-1.

Primary RPE cell cultures were characterized by indirect immunofluorescence and exhibited positive immunoreactivity for RET-PE2, a monoclonal antibody that recognizes RPE cells, and for the intermediate filaments cytokeratin and vimentin. The survival of cultured RPE cells in serum-free defined medium in the presence of CNTF or LIF was investigated during a 0- to 5-day period. Both CNTF and LIF, at concentrations of 1-50 ng/mL (4-200 pM), markedly enhanced RPE cell survival. Bromodeoxyuridine labelling of RPE cells revealed an increased mitotic activity in cell cultures treated with either CNTF or LIF in comparison to untreated serum-free cultures. Increases in cell survival and proliferation after neurokine treatment were also observed with the BPEI-1 cell line. However, in comparison to the primary RPE cultures, LIF was more effective than CNTF in promoting survival of the cell line over a 5-day treatment period. These studies demonstrate that the neurokines CNTF and LIF are potent trophic factors for mammalian RPE cells in vitro and may serve as candidate therapeutic agents in degenerative conditions that affect the retina and RPE.","['Gupta, S K', 'Jollimore, C A', 'McLaren, M J', 'Inana, G', 'Kelly, M E']","['Gupta SK', 'Jollimore CA', 'McLaren MJ', 'Inana G', 'Kelly ME']","['Department of Pharmacology, Dalhousie University, Halifax, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Canada,Biochem Cell Biol,Biochemistry and cell biology = Biochimie et biologie cellulaire,8606068,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Vimentin)', '68238-35-7 (Keratins)', 'G34N38R2N1 (Bromodeoxyuridine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'Bromodeoxyuridine/analysis', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique, Indirect', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Immunohistochemistry', '*Interleukin-6', 'Keratins/analysis', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*pharmacology', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/*pharmacology', 'Pigment Epithelium of Eye/chemistry/*drug effects', 'Rats', 'Vimentin/analysis']",1997/01/01 00:00,1997/01/01 00:01,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Biochem Cell Biol. 1997;75(2):119-25.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Multiple myeloma arising in elderly patients remains at this time an incurable disease, while attention to supportive therapy and palliation can make a great impact on the quality of life. Fortunately advances have been made in last years in this field. Therapy at the time of diagnosis is usually recommended for patients with symptomatic disease, or for those who may be asymptomatic, but have evidence of high tumor burden of a biologically aggressive disease, and may be expected to progress and develop complications over a short period of time. Melphalan combined with prednisone remains the standard therapy choice in elderly patients. Radiotherapy maintains an important place in the palliation of destructive bone disease in poorly controlled myeloma, particularly in elderly patients. In Acute Myelogenous Leukemia, age has been concordantly reported as an adverse prognostic indicator in affecting both remission rates and survival. The overall unsatisfactory therapeutic results appear connected with host-related factors, and intrinsic differences in the biology of leukemia. Patients with standard risk should be included in collaborative trials aimed at improving the long-term results of conventional therapy. Patients with high risk and unfavorable prognostic factors, could be enrolled in controlled studies aimed at better assessing, in the elderly, the long term results of newer drug combinations. A watch and wait strategy, consisting of transfusion support and leukocytosis control, should be limited to patients with extremely poor performance status (PS), very limited life-expectancy and/or severe comorbidity displaying unfavorable biologic factors, including secondary Acute Myelogenous Leukemia.","['Zagonel, V', 'Babare, R', 'Spazzapan, S', 'Rupolo, M', 'Bordonaro, R', 'Ferrara, F', 'Pinto, A']","['Zagonel V', 'Babare R', 'Spazzapan S', 'Rupolo M', 'Bordonaro R', 'Ferrara F', 'Pinto A']","['Divisione di Oncologia Medica, Centro di Riferimento Oncologico, IRCCS, Aviano, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Rays,Rays,7707724,,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*therapy', 'Male', 'Multiple Myeloma/*therapy', 'Palliative Care']",1997/01/01 00:00,1997/01/01 00:01,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Rays. 1997 Jan-Mar;22(1 Suppl):30-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since the HOX11 gene is well conserved between human and murine, we sequenced 5' flanking region of the murine Hox11 gene and analyzed the elements. We identified the transcription start site (+1) of the gene using mRNA from fetal spleens by primer extension analysis. The start site was determined at 795 bp upstream from the ATG site. A typical TATA box sequence was found at 35 bp upstream from the start site. Furthermore, promoter activity of the 5' flanking region of the start site was monitored by luciferase assay. The activity mainly located within a 540-bp fragment immediately upstream from the start site (-540 to +1). The (-1240 to -540) region contained a negative regulatory element of the transcription.

In this work, we have identified partial cDNAs corresponding to five to nine new transcripts from an 80 kb P1 clone that spans ten breakpoints. These transcripts, with one exception, appear to be expressed only at low levels in the set of cancer cell lines examined. Four transcripts are located between the previously mapped Ribophorin I gene and the most centromeric breakpoint; three map directly within the 20 kb spanning nine independent breakpoints. These data (i) show that among characterized leukemia breakpoint regions 3q21 is unusually gene rich, (ii) provide new candidates for relevance to leukemia in 3q21, and (iii) suggest possibilities for chromatin configuration effects.","['Rynditch, A', 'Pekarsky, Y', 'Schnittger, S', 'Gardiner, K']","['Rynditch A', 'Pekarsky Y', 'Schnittger S', 'Gardiner K']","['Eleanor Roosevelt Institute for Cancer Research, Denver, CO 80206, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Gene,Gene,7706761,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Chromosome Breakage/*genetics', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 3', 'HL-60 Cells', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Transcription, Genetic']",1997/07/01 00:00,1997/07/01 00:01,['1997/07/01 00:00'],"['1997/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0378-1119(97)00076-0 [pii]', '10.1016/s0378-1119(97)00076-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Gene. 1997 Jul 1;193(1):49-57. doi: 10.1016/s0378-1119(97)00076-0.,,,,,,,"['GENBANK/U82291', 'GENBANK/U82292', 'GENBANK/U82293', 'GENBANK/U82294', 'GENBANK/U82295', 'GENBANK/U82296', 'GENBANK/U82297', 'GENBANK/U82298', 'GENBANK/U82299', 'GENBANK/U82300']",,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVES: To design and evaluate synthetic core and envelope-derived peptide enzyme immunoassays (EIA) for serological differential diagnosis. STUDY DESIGN: Peptide EIAs were evaluated with a panel of 202 plasma samples comprised of HTLV antibody positive, serologically classified as confirmed, indeterminate, or non confirmed, characterized as HTLV-I, HTLV-II or neither by genomic amplification. The peptide EIA with the best performance was further used to differentiate between HTLV-I and HTLV-II antibodies in 807 samples from 18 countries in four continents and to provide ratios between the two infections. RESULTS: The gp46 peptide EIA correctly identified 96.5% of HTLV-I and 98.6% of HTLV-II antibody-confirmed samples. HTLV-I was found exclusively in Japan and Caribbean countries; almost exclusively in Africa. HTLV-II represented 10-25% of samples from Canada, Chile and Venezuela and was predominant in the US.

Sensitive detection of occult breast cancer by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction.

However, the amplified product detected in the control samples represents the transcript of the CK19 gene as confirmed by the results of Mae III digestion. It should be pointed out that although the CK19 expression was detected, the levels of expression in PBMC were almost negligible for they disappeared at 1:5 cDNA dilution. Moreover, a direct relationship between the number of BC cells added to PBMC and the increasing dilution levels of the cDNA necessary to prevent CK19 expression was observed. This allows us to conclude that the cDNA dilutions make it possible to distinguish the false from the true positive samples and that, in addition, the cDNA dilutions inform about the degree of BC cell contamination.","['Lopez-Guerrero, J A', 'Bolufer-Gilabert, P', 'Sanz-Alonso, M', 'Barragan-Gonzalez, E', 'Palau-Perez, J', 'De la Rubia-Comos, J', 'Sempere-Talens, A', 'Bonanad-Boix, S']","['Lopez-Guerrero JA', 'Bolufer-Gilabert P', 'Sanz-Alonso M', 'Barragan-Gonzalez E', 'Palau-Perez J', 'De la Rubia-Comos J', 'Sempere-Talens A', 'Bonanad-Boix S']","['Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Hospital La Fe, Valencia, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Clin Chim Acta,Clinica chimica acta; international journal of clinical chemistry,1302422,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '68238-35-7 (Keratins)']",IM,"['Breast Neoplasms/genetics', 'Case-Control Studies', 'DNA, Complementary/blood/genetics', 'DNA, Neoplasm/blood/genetics', 'Evaluation Studies as Topic', 'Female', '*Gene Expression', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Hodgkin Disease/genetics', 'Humans', 'Keratins/*genetics', 'Leukemia/genetics', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/*metabolism', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods/statistics & numerical data', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",1997/07/04 00:00,1997/07/04 00:01,['1997/07/04 00:00'],"['1997/07/04 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/07/04 00:01 [medline]', '1997/07/04 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0009-8981(97)00054-5 [pii]', '10.1016/s0009-8981(97)00054-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Chim Acta. 1997 Jul 4;263(1):105-16. doi: 10.1016/s0009-8981(97)00054-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Retrospective case study. PROCEDURE: Hospital records were reviewed for 7159 cats, sick or healthy, examined during a 10-year period (1984 to 1994). Sixty cats with lymphosarcoma were identified and classified by anatomical location of the tumor. Data on breed, age, sex, clinical signs and diagnostic procedures were collated. RESULTS: The prevalence of feline lymphosarcoma in the hospital population was 0.84%. Siamese cats appeared predisposed to lymphosarcoma but other purebreds were not. Males were somewhat overrepresented amongst affected cats. Similar numbers of cases (12 to 18) were seen in each of the four anatomic categories (multicentric, mediastinal, alimentary and extranodal). Cats with mediastinal lymphosarcoma were mostly young and Siamese. Clinical signs in affected cats were varied, usually multiple and often nonspecific. Two of 22 cases tested positive for feline leukaemia virus antigen in blood and 6 of 13 were positive for feline immunodeficiency virus antibody. CONCLUSIONS: Extranodal lymphosarcoma seemed more prevalent in this study than reported elsewhere. Siamese cats in the study population may have had a genetic predisposition to lymphosarcoma. Limited evidence suggested feline leukaemia virus may be less important, and feline immunodeficiency virus more important, in the local population than indicated in overseas reports. Additional studies are needed to investigate breed predisposition and feline leukaemia virus and feline immunodeficiency virus status in Australian cats with lymphosarcoma.","['Court, E A', 'Watson, A D', 'Peaston, A E']","['Court EA', 'Watson AD', 'Peaston AE']","['Department of Veterinary Clinical Sciences, University of Sydney, New South Wales.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Aust Vet J,Australian veterinary journal,0370616,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Antigens, Viral)']",IM,"['Age Distribution', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/blood', 'Antigens, Viral/blood', 'Australia/epidemiology', 'Cat Diseases/*epidemiology/etiology/pathology', 'Cats', 'Digestive System Neoplasms/epidemiology/pathology/*veterinary', 'Feline Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/complications/physiopathology', 'Female', 'Immunodeficiency Virus, Feline/immunology/physiology', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/immunology/physiology', 'Leukemia, Feline/complications/physiopathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/epidemiology/pathology/*veterinary', 'Male', 'Mediastinal Neoplasms/epidemiology/pathology/*veterinary', 'Prevalence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sex Distribution']",1997/06/01 00:00,1997/06/01 00:01,['1997/06/01 00:00'],"['1997/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1751-0813.1997.tb14347.x [doi]'],ppublish,Aust Vet J. 1997 Jun;75(6):424-7. doi: 10.1111/j.1751-0813.1997.tb14347.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To investigate whether lymphocyte-specific elements are essential for LFA-1 function, we expressed LFA-1 in the erythroleukemic cell line K562, which expresses only the integrin very late antigen 5. We observed that LFA-1-expressing K562 cannot bind to intercellular adhesion molecule 1-coated surfaces when stimulated by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), whereas the LFA-1-activating antibody KIM185 markedly enhanced adhesion. Because the endogenously expressed beta 1 integrin very late antigen 5 is readily activated by PMA, we investigated the role of the cytoplasmic domain of distinct beta subunits in regulating LFA-1 function. Transfection of chimeric LFA-1 receptors in K562 cells reveals that replacement of the beta 2 cytoplasmic tail with the beta 1 but not the beta 7 cytoplasmic tail completely restores PMA responsiveness of LFA-1, whereas a beta 2 cytoplasmic deletion mutant of LFA-1 is constitutively active. Both deletion of the beta 2 cytoplasmic tail or replacement by the beta 1 cytoplasmic tail alters the localization of LFA-1 into clusters, thereby regulating LFA-1 activation and LFA-1-mediated adhesion to intercellular adhesion molecule 1. These data demonstrate that distinct signaling routes activate beta 1 and beta 2 integrins through the beta-chain and hint at the involvement of lymphocyte-specific signal transduction elements in beta 2 and beta 7 integrin activation that are absent in the nonlymphocytic cell line K562.","['Lub, M', 'van Vliet, S J', 'Oomen, S P', 'Pieters, R A', 'Robinson, M', 'Figdor, C G', 'van Kooyk, Y']","['Lub M', 'van Vliet SJ', 'Oomen SP', 'Pieters RA', 'Robinson M', 'Figdor CG', 'van Kooyk Y']","['Department of Tumor Immunology, University Hospital Nijmegen St. Radboud, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Biol Cell,Molecular biology of the cell,9201390,"['0 (CD18 Antigens)', '0 (Fibronectins)', '0 (Integrin beta Chains)', '0 (Integrin beta1)', '0 (Integrins)', '0 (Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (integrin beta7)', '126547-89-5 (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'CD18 Antigens/drug effects/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Adhesion/physiology', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Cytoplasm/*metabolism', 'Fibronectins/metabolism', 'Humans', '*Integrin beta Chains', 'Integrin beta1/drug effects/genetics/metabolism', 'Integrins/drug effects/genetics/*metabolism', 'Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Experimental', 'Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1/drug effects/genetics/*metabolism', 'Lymphocytes/physiology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Recombinant Proteins/drug effects/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/04/01 00:00,1997/04/01 00:01,['1997/04/01 00:00'],"['1997/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1091/mbc.8.4.719 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Biol Cell. 1997 Apr;8(4):719-28. doi: 10.1091/mbc.8.4.719.,,,,,PMC276121,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Based on these findings in vitro, we investigated whether this system could also be effective in vivo, using a rat model. Following infection of the HTLV-I-transformed and tax-expressing rat T cell line TARS-1 with this retrovirus (LNLTK virus), high levels of HSV TK expression were observed and resulted in increased susceptibility to ganciclovir (GCV). Tumors were generated by subcutaneous injection of TARS-1 in newborn syngeneic WKA/H rats. While the tumors derived from infected TARS-1 cells with control virus, as well as uninfected cells, continued to grow in all the rats with or without administration of GCV, those derived from LNLTK-infected cells exhibited dramatic regression upon GCV treatment. These results indicate that the HTLV-I LTR-HSV TK system also causes selective elimination of HTLV-I-transformed, tax-expressing T cells in vivo.

We investigated the effects of TPA on the expression of vimentin during the differentiation of THP-1 cells at both the mRNA and the protein level. On northern blotting analysis, a 2.1 kb vimentin mRNA was up-regulated by TPA. On western blotting, small vimentin molecules with a molecular mass of approximately 40 kDa were observed in the soluble fraction and increased with TPA-induction of cellular differentiation. Since larger, including intact, vimentin molecules were detectable at a high TPA dose, we assessed the possible existence of protease activity directed against vimentin in THP-1 cells. With incubation of the cellular lysates of THP-1 cells, the endogenous vimentin became increasingly smaller over time, suggesting the presence of a vimentin-degrading protease. Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride inhibited this apparent protease activity against vimentin, suggesting the enzyme involved to be a serine protease. Interestingly, the protease activity was down-regulated by TPA treatment. TPA-treated THP-1 cells were found to express a vimentin-filament network based on immunocytochemical analysis using an anti-vimentin monoclonal antibody, V9. Taken together, these observations suggest that post-translational mechanisms work in cooperation with transcriptional regulation to maintain the vimentin-intermediate filament structure in differentiated THP-1 cells.","['Honke, K', 'Wada, Y']","['Honke K', 'Wada Y']","['Department of Molecular Medicine, Osaka Medical Center for Maternal and Child Health.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Japan,Jpn J Cancer Res,Japanese journal of cancer research : Gann,8509412,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Vimentin)', 'EC 1.2.1.- (Glyceraldehyde-3-Phosphate Dehydrogenases)', 'EC 3.4.- (Endopeptidases)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Western', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Endopeptidases/*metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Glyceraldehyde-3-Phosphate Dehydrogenases/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/metabolism/*pathology', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Molecular Weight', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vimentin/*genetics/*metabolism']",1997/05/01 00:00,1997/05/01 00:01,['1997/05/01 00:00'],"['1997/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0910505097884426 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1349-7006.1997.tb00407.x [doi]']",ppublish,Jpn J Cancer Res. 1997 May;88(5):484-91. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.1997.tb00407.x.,,,,,PMC5921461,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of auraptene (18 microM) was almost equal to that of genistein. Umbelliferone, which lacks a geranyloxyl group present in auraptene, was less active (IC50 = 450 microM). In a two-stage carcinogenesis experiment with 7,12-dimethylbenz[a] anthracene (topical application at 0.19 mumol) and TPA (topical application at 1.6 nmol) in ICR mouse skin, topical application of auraptene (at 160 nmol) significantly reduced tumor incidence and the numbers of tumors per mouse by 27% (P < 0.01) and 23% (P < 0.05), respectively. Auraptene at a concentration of 50 microM markedly suppressed superoxide (O2-) generation induced by 100 microM TPA in differentiated human promyelocytic HL-60 cells.

Inhibition of intracellular hydroperoxide formation in differentiated HL-60 cells by auraptene was also confirmed by flow-cytometric analysis using 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein diacetate as a fluorescence probe.

These results indicate that auraptene is a chemopreventer of skin tumorigenesis, and implies that suppression of leukocyte activation might be the mechanism through which it inhibits tumor promotion.","['Murakami, A', 'Kuki, W', 'Takahashi, Y', 'Yonei, H', 'Nakamura, Y', 'Ohto, Y', 'Ohigashi, H', 'Koshimizu, K']","['Murakami A', 'Kuki W', 'Takahashi Y', 'Yonei H', 'Nakamura Y', 'Ohto Y', 'Ohigashi H', 'Koshimizu K']","['Department of Biotechnological Science, Faculty of Biology-Oriented Science and Technology, Kinki University, Wakayama.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Jpn J Cancer Res,Japanese journal of cancer research : Gann,8509412,"['0 (Anticarcinogenic Agents)', '0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (Coumarins)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Umbelliferones)', '11062-77-4 (Superoxides)', '57-97-6 (9,10-Dimethyl-1,2-benzanthracene)', '60Z60NTL4G (7-hydroxycoumarin)', 'F79I1ZEL2E (aurapten)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['9,10-Dimethyl-1,2-benzanthracene', 'Animals', 'Anticarcinogenic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Carcinogens', 'Cell Line', 'Citrus/*chemistry', 'Coumarins/analysis/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/metabolism', 'Leukocytes/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred ICR', 'Skin Neoplasms/chemically induced/*prevention & control', 'Superoxides/*metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate', 'Umbelliferones/therapeutic use']",1997/05/01 00:00,1997/05/01 00:01,['1997/05/01 00:00'],"['1997/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0910505097884372 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1349-7006.1997.tb00402.x [doi]']",ppublish,Jpn J Cancer Res. 1997 May;88(5):443-52. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.1997.tb00402.x.,,,,,PMC5921462,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ALL-1 is the human homologue of Drosophila trithorax. The latter is a member of the trithorax group (trx-G) genes which together with the Polycomb group (Pc-G) genes act as positive and negative regulators, respectively, to determine the body structure of Drosophila. We have cloned a novel human gene, ALR, which encodes a gigantic 5262 amino acid long protein containing a SET domain, five PHD fingers, potential zinc fingers, and a very long run of glutamines interrupted by hydrophobic residues, mostly leucine. The SET motif, PDH fingers, zinc fingers and two other regions are most similar to domains of ALL-1 and TRX. The first two motifs are also found in other trx-G and Pc-G proteins. The ALR gene was mapped to chromosome band 12q12-13, adjacent to the VDR gene. This region is involved in duplications and translocations associated with cancer. The analysis of ALR expression showed that its approximately 18 kb long mRNA is expressed, like ALL-1, in most adult tissues, including a variety of hematopoietic cells, with the exception of the liver. Whole mount in situ hybridization to early mouse embryos indicates expression in multiple tissues. Based on similarities in structure and expression pattern, ALR is likely to play a similar role to ALL-1 and trx, although its target genes have yet to be identified.","['Prasad, R', 'Zhadanov, A B', 'Sedkov, Y', 'Bullrich, F', 'Druck, T', 'Rallapalli, R', 'Yano, T', 'Alder, H', 'Croce, C M', 'Huebner, K', 'Mazo, A', 'Canaani, E']","['Prasad R', 'Zhadanov AB', 'Sedkov Y', 'Bullrich F', 'Druck T', 'Rallapalli R', 'Yano T', 'Alder H', 'Croce CM', 'Huebner K', 'Mazo A', 'Canaani E']","['Kimmel Cancer Institute, Jefferson Medical College, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19107, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Drosophila Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (KMT2D protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Trl protein, Drosophila)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Age Factors', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Chromosome Mapping', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 12', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Drosophila/genetics', '*Drosophila Proteins', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization/methods', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', '*Neoplasm Proteins', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Tissue Distribution', '*Transcription Factors', 'Zinc Fingers']",1997/07/31 00:00,1997/07/31 00:01,['1997/07/31 00:00'],"['1997/07/31 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/07/31 00:01 [medline]', '1997/07/31 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1201211 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 1997 Jul 31;15(5):549-60. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1201211.,,,"['CA39860/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA50507/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,"['GENBANK/AF010403', 'GENBANK/AF010404']",,,,,,,,,,,,

However, at recurrence following in vivo treatment of the leukaemia with mitoxantrone, the leukaemia cells developed significant insensitivity (p = 0.04) to stimulation by WEHI-conditioned medium. This altered growth-factor sensitivity was detected when two different assays were used. The recurrent leukaemic cells were morphologically indistinguishable from untreated leukaemic cells, but in normal mice they regained sensitivity to growth factors after a single transplant. The recurrent leukaemic cells were significantly resistant to some concentrations of mitoxantrone in vitro (p = 0.012). The magnitude of this resistance was mainly a function of the dose of mitoxantrone used in the initial treatment of the leukaemia.

Richter's transformation is a well-recognized complication of chronic lymphocytic leukemia. This transformation is the progression of chronic lymphocytic leukemia to a high-grade lymphoma.

The patient responded to chemotherapy with normalization of hepatic function and remained disease-free after eight months.

Insulin and prostaglandin E1 (PGE1), which fail to stimulate DNA synthesis alone, potentiate this effect. Prostaglandin F2alpha (PGF2alpha), which is mitogenic in these cells, enhances the effect of LIF on DNA synthesis. TGFbeta1 increases the effect of PGF2alpha but not that of LIF. R-59022, a diacylglycerol kinase inhibitor which increases protein kinase C (PKC) activity, enhances only the PGF2alpha response. 13-Tetradecanoyl-12-phorbolacetate-mediated PKC depletion prevents the action of PGF2alpha but not that of LIF, nor the PGF2alpha potentiation of LIF-stimulated DNA synthesis. 1-Oleoyl-2acetylglycerol, a PKC and tyrosine kinase (TK) activator which mimics some of the PGF2alpha effects, enhances only LIF-induced DNA synthesis in cells possessing intact PKC activity.

Here, we report that RBM3, another member of the GRP family, is induced in human cells in response to cold stress (32 degrees C). RBM3 transcripts were constitutively expressed in all cell lines examined including K562, HepG2, NC65, HeLa, and T24 cells. In all of them, the transcript levels of RBM3 were increased at 24 h after the 37 to 32 degrees C temperature down-shift. In NC65 cells, the kinetics of RBM3 induction was different from that of CIRP. Protein synthesis inhibitors cycloheximide and puromycin induced RBM3 transcripts, but cadmium chloride, H2O2, ethanol, and osmotic shock had no effect. Combined with the different tissue distribution of expression, these results suggest that RBM3 and CIRP play distinct roles in cold responses of human cells.","['Danno, S', 'Nishiyama, H', 'Higashitsuji, H', 'Yokoi, H', 'Xue, J H', 'Itoh, K', 'Matsuda, T', 'Fujita, J']","['Danno S', 'Nishiyama H', 'Higashitsuji H', 'Yokoi H', 'Xue JH', 'Itoh K', 'Matsuda T', 'Fujita J']","['Department of Clinical Molecular Biology, Faculty of Medicine, Kyoto University, Sakyo-ku, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (Protein Synthesis Inhibitors)', '0 (RBM3 protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '4A6ZS6Q2CL (Puromycin)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)']",IM,"['Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/metabolism', '*Cold Temperature', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'HeLa Cells/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kidney Neoplasms/metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia/metabolism', 'Liver Neoplasms/metabolism', 'Protein Synthesis Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Puromycin/pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis/*biosynthesis', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Tissue Distribution', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Urinary Bladder Neoplasms/metabolism']",1997/07/30 00:00,1997/07/30 00:01,['1997/07/30 00:00'],"['1997/07/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/07/30 00:01 [medline]', '1997/07/30 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-291X(97)97059-5 [pii]', '10.1006/bbrc.1997.7059 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 1997 Jul 30;236(3):804-7. doi: 10.1006/bbrc.1997.7059.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: CCT scans of 68 children with non-B-ALL were analyzed retrospectively for signs of atrophy and changes in density. Patients were treated between 1981 and 1990 at the St. Anna Childrens Hospital Vienna according to the ALL-BFM protocols. Children were examined with CCT in defined periods from diagnosis until 3 years after cessation of treatment. As a control group served 69 patients with solid tumors who had not received corticoids or cranial irradiation. RESULTS: At the initial examination 56% of the ALL-patients showed CCT changes, 85% of these patients had already received corticoids. In the control group only 20% of the CCTs were found abnormal (p = 0.005). In both groups an age-dependence was found: 64% of the ALL-patients under five years of age and 22% of the patients above 5 years had initial CCT changes (p = 0.001). In the control group 39% of the patients under five years of age and 7% of the older patients showed CCT changes at the beginning of treatment (p = 0.003). The highest incidence of abnormal CCT scans (68%) was seen during intensive chemo- and radiotherapy. Until the end of therapy the incidence of abnormal CCTs decreased to 32%. After cessation of antileukemic therapy 35% of the patients whose CNS-prophylaxis included cranial irradiation, and 12% of the non-irradiated patients had abnormal CCT scans. CONCLUSION: Corticoids can cause reversible signs of cerebral atrophy. In the assessment of CCTs a physiological age-dependence of the volume of the CSF compartment has to be taken into consideration. The main reason for non-reversible CCT changes is the CNS- prophylaxis, above all the cranial irradiation, whereby younger children seem to be particular vulnerable.","['Michael, C', 'Mor, W', 'Binder, H', 'Gatterer-Menz, I', 'Siemes, H', 'Gadner, H']","['Michael C', 'Mor W', 'Binder H', 'Gatterer-Menz I', 'Siemes H', 'Gadner H']","['Christophorus-Kinderkrankenhaus, Berlin.']",['ger'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Klin Padiatr,Klinische Padiatrie,0326144,"['5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '9PHQ9Y1OLM (Prednisolone)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)', 'PVDA protocol']",IM,"['Age Factors', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/administration & dosage', 'Atrophy', 'Brain/*pathology', 'Brain Diseases/*diagnostic imaging/etiology/pathology', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*pathology/therapy', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Prednisolone/adverse effects', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",1997/05/01 00:00,1997/05/01 00:01,['1997/05/01 00:00'],"['1997/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1055/s-2008-1043937 [doi]'],ppublish,Klin Padiatr. 1997 May-Jun;209(3):105-10. doi: 10.1055/s-2008-1043937.,,,,,,Langzeitbeobachtung der therapiebedingten cranialen computertomographischen Veranderungen bei Kindern mit akuter lymphoblastischer Leukamie.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the CMV antigenemia assay was shown to be useful for detection of CMV, it may be necessary to confirm not only the sensitivity but also the specificity of this method for prevention of CMV disease after BMT.","['Sakamaki, H', 'Yuasa, K', 'Goto, H', 'Tanikawa, S', 'Akiyama, H', 'Onozawa, Y', 'Okamoto, R', 'Maeda, Y', 'Sasaki, T', 'Kaku, H', 'Tsuzuki, S', 'Takamoto, S', 'Mochida, Y', 'Minematsu, T', 'Minamishima, Y']","['Sakamaki H', 'Yuasa K', 'Goto H', 'Tanikawa S', 'Akiyama H', 'Onozawa Y', 'Okamoto R', 'Maeda Y', 'Sasaki T', 'Kaku H', 'Tsuzuki S', 'Takamoto S', 'Mochida Y', 'Minematsu T', 'Minamishima Y']","['Bone Marrow Transplantation Team, Metropolitan Komagome General Hospital, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Controlled Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,"['0 (Antigens, Viral)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Anemia, Aplastic/complications/therapy', 'Antigens, Viral/*blood', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid/*virology', 'Cytomegalovirus', 'Cytomegalovirus Infections/*diagnosis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/complications/therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications/therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/complications/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/complications/therapy', 'Pneumonia, Viral/*diagnosis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/therapy']",1997/07/01 00:00,1997/07/01 00:01,['1997/07/01 00:00'],"['1997/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.bmt.1700856 [doi]'],ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1997 Jul;20(2):143-7. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1700856.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This comprised one or more of: infusion of donor cells (n = 22), stopping cyclosporine (n = 14), and administration of interferon-alpha2b (n = 15) or interleukin-2 (n = 4). Eight acute leukemia patients received chemotherapy as well. The time from relapse to immunotherapy was 0-1344 days (median 4). Acute and/or chronic GVHD developed in 17 patients. Response was not evaluable in three patients due to early toxic death. There was no response in 10 patients, whereas 19 showed objective response. Nine patients died due to toxicity and 10 due to progressive disease. Thirteen patients are alive 4-58 months (median 14) after immunotherapy; 12 in remission (five AML, four chronic phase CML, one ALL, one accelerated phase CML, one CLL) and one with progressive disease (accelerated phase CML). Eleven of 13 patients who are alive had GVHD compared with six of 19 who died (P = 0.005, Fisher's exact test). We conclude that with the exception of CML in myeloid blast crisis, immunotherapy is active in most types of acute and chronic leukemia relapsing after allogeneic BMT. It is associated with considerable toxicity.

Little information is available regarding its prognostic influence on post-transplant outcome. In our institution, 202 patients with AML received an allogeneic HLA-identical marrow transplant from related donors between March 1982 and January 1994. Thirteen patients had prior leukemic involvement of the skin (leukemia cutis or LC group) while 189 patients did not (non-LC group). There was a higher incidence of patients with the M4-M5 FAB subtypes in the LC group (83%) as compared to the non-LC group (33%). In addition, the percentage of patients transplanted in relapse was also higher in the LC group (69 vs 15%). While there were no differences observed in the rates of relapse post-transplant in the LC and non-LC groups when matched for stage of disease at transplant, the sites of relapse differed markedly. Five of six relapses in the LC group involved extramedullary sites as compared to only six of 38 relapses in the non-LC group (P = 0.002), with a 6-year probability of extramedullary relapse of 38.5% in the LC group as compared to 3.9% in the non-LC group. This increased probability of extramedullary relapse was independent of the FAB morphology (50 vs 2% for patients with the M4-M5 subtypes in the LC and the non-LC group respectively) and of disease status at the time of transplant. Moreover, only three relapses post-transplant involved the skin, all of which were in the LC group, with a probability of skin relapse of 23.1% in this group. Patients with AML and leukemia cutis have a remarkable propensity to relapse in extramedullary sites following marrow transplantation. These relapses occur in the skin as well as other organs. Further investigations are needed to understand the biological basis of this clinical feature.","['Michel, G', 'Boulad, F', 'Small, T N', 'Black, P', 'Heller, G', 'Castro-Malaspina, H', 'Childs, B H', 'Gillio, A P', 'Papadopoulos, E B', 'Young, J W', 'Kernan, N A', ""O'Reilly, R J""]","['Michel G', 'Boulad F', 'Small TN', 'Black P', 'Heller G', 'Castro-Malaspina H', 'Childs BH', 'Gillio AP', 'Papadopoulos EB', 'Young JW', 'Kernan NA', ""O'Reilly RJ""]","['Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, Department of Pediatrics, New York, New York 10021, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,,IM,"['Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/pathology/*therapy', 'Leukemic Infiltration/*therapy', 'Male', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Assessment', 'Skin/*pathology', 'Treatment Outcome']",1997/07/01 00:00,1997/07/01 00:01,['1997/07/01 00:00'],"['1997/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.bmt.1700857 [doi]'],ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1997 Jul;20(2):107-12. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1700857.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In subsets of the tumor at relapse, two separate VH gene segments were found to have replaced the VH gene utilized by a VHDJH rearrangement identified at diagnosis.

Appropriate protocols must include methods and reagents appropriate for human use. The cryopreservation protocols developed must also reflect the biological and physical properties of the cells that can be altered significantly by the culture process.

Attempts to translate between the principle classifications have been unsuccessful and historically it has been difficult to arrive at an unified approach. In addition, many new lymphoma entities have been recognized in recent years that are not delineated in any of the existing classification schemes. To provide a unified international basis for clinical and investigative work in this field, in 1994 the International Lymphoma Study Group (ILSG) proposed a new classification termed Revised European-American Classification of Lymphoid Neoplasms (REAL). This review discusses the REAL classification, especially as it pertains to cutaneous lymphomas, and provides insight into the clinicopathologic features of lymphoproliferative disease involving the skin. The premise of the REAL classification is that a classification scheme should be based on the delineation of disease entities, utilizing pathologic, immunophenotypic, genetic, and clinical features. Therefore, if cutaneous involvement is an integral aspect of any lymphoma subtype, this clinical information is included in the definition of that neoplasm.

The above soluble adhesion molecules were determined in the serum of 35 children with ALL and 30 healthy children (control group) of the same age range. The samples were obtained before treatment, 6 months after the beginning of the treatment (remission of the disease), 6 months after the end of the treatment and during relapse of the disease. The mean levels of sICAM-1, sVCAM-1 and sE-selectin at the onset of the disease were 646.6 +/- 80.9 ng/ml, 1786 +/- 151.8 ng/ml and 140.5 +/- 17.3 ng/ml, respectively. These values were significantly higher (P < 0.001) than those of the control group, which were, 245.8 +/- 25.7 ng/ml, 798.6 +/- 78.9 ng/ml and 44.7 +/- 18.2 ng/ml respectively. During remission, the mean levels did not differ significantly from those of the control group. After the end of the treatment the mean levels again did not show any significant differences compared to the control group. During relapse the soluble adhesion molecule mean levels (923.9 +/- 110.1 ng/ml, 2945.7 +/- 349.9 ng/ml and 258.2 +/- 5.1 ng/ml) were significantly higher (P < 0.001) than those of the control group and also than those obtained during remission and after the end of the treatment (P < 0.001). Pearson's correlation coefficient r was computed in order to detect possible linear correlations between: (1) sICAM-1 and sVCAM-1 (r = 0.632); (2) sICAM-1 and sE-selectin (r = 0.788) and (3) sVCAM-1 and sE-selectin (r = 0.752). All three cases correspond to P < 0.001, thus indicating strong linear correlations. CONCLUSIONS: The levels of soluble circulating adhesion molecule levels can be utilized for monitoring disease activity of ALL and its response to treatment, as well as for early detection of relapse. Strong linear correlations between the three soluble adhesion molecules tested suggest that each of them may be sufficient as an indicator.","['Hatzistilianou, M', 'Athanassiadou, F', 'Agguridaki, C', 'Catriu, D']","['Hatzistilianou M', 'Athanassiadou F', 'Agguridaki C', 'Catriu D']","['Second Department of Paediatrics, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Eur J Pediatr,European journal of pediatrics,7603873,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (E-Selectin)', '0 (Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1)', '126547-89-5 (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'E-Selectin/*blood', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1/*blood', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*blood/drug therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1/*blood']",1997/07/01 00:00,1997/07/01 00:01,['1997/07/01 00:00'],"['1997/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s004310050657 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Pediatr. 1997 Jul;156(7):537-40. doi: 10.1007/s004310050657.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In patients transplanted during second or third complete remission, allogeneic transplantation can also be curative, although there is lower relapse-free survival. Despite the success of this treatment modality, only 10-20% of patients will be eligible to receive an allogeneic transplantation due to advanced age or lack of an HLA-matched donor. In this situation, autologous bone marrow transplantation allows therapy of comparable intensity to be administered with less morbidity and mortality due to the lack of graft-versus-host disease. In contrast to allografts, remission autografts may harbor residual occult malignant cells unable to be grossly detected. The infusion of these malignant cells following myeloablative therapy can contribute to leukemia relapse. Various in vitro approaches to 'purge' occult malignant leukemia cells from remission marrows have been developed. The two techniques that have been studied in preclinical and clinical trials include pharmacological and monoclonal antibody-mediated methods. The efficacy of using the latter to purge autografts compared with the use of unpurged autografts in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia undergoing autologous bone marrow transplantation is currently the focus of a prospective multicenter trial.","['Hammert, L C', 'Ball, E D']","['Hammert LC', 'Ball ED']","['University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, Department of Medicine, Pennsylvania, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Blood Rev,Blood reviews,8708558,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/*therapeutic use', '*Bone Marrow Purging', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology/*therapy', 'Neoplasm, Residual/diagnosis', 'Transplantation Conditioning/methods']",1997/06/01 00:00,1997/06/01 00:01,['1997/06/01 00:00'],"['1997/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0268-960X(97)90014-X [pii]', '10.1016/s0268-960x(97)90014-x [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Rev. 1997 Jun;11(2):80-90. doi: 10.1016/s0268-960x(97)90014-x.,76,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These responses are thought to be mediated through the functional LIF receptor (LIFR), consisting of a heterodimeric complex of LIFR alpha-chain (LIFRalpha) and gp130. The present study investigated the relative capacity of the cytoplasmic domains of each receptor subunit to signal particular responses in several cell types. To monitor the signaling potential of LIFRalpha and gp130 individually, we constructed chimeric receptors by linking the extracellular domain of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor (GCSFR) to the transmembrane and cytoplasmic regions of either LIFRalpha or gp130. Both chimeric receptors and the full-length GCSFR in expressed in M1 myeloid leukemic cells to measure differentiation induction, in embryonic stem cells to measure differentiation inhibition, and in Ba/F3 cells to measure cell proliferation. Our results demonstrated that whereas GCSFR-gp130 receptor homodimer mediated a GCSF-induced signal in all three cell types, the GCSFR-LIFRalpha receptor homodimer was only functional in embryonic stem cells. These findings suggest that the signaling potential of gp130 and LIFRalpha cytoplasmic domains may differ depending upon the tissue and cellular response initiated.","['Starr, R', 'Novak, U', 'Willson, T A', 'Inglese, M', 'Murphy, V', 'Alexander, W S', 'Metcalf, D', 'Nicola, N A', 'Hilton, D J', 'Ernst, M']","['Starr R', 'Novak U', 'Willson TA', 'Inglese M', 'Murphy V', 'Alexander WS', 'Metcalf D', 'Nicola NA', 'Hilton DJ', 'Ernst M']","['Cooperative Research Centre for Cellular Growth Factors and the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute for Medical Research, Victoria 3050, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (IL6ST protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (LIFR protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism', 'DNA/metabolism', 'Dimerization', '*Growth Inhibitors', 'Humans', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit', 'Lymphokines/*metabolism', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Macrophages/cytology/metabolism', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Cytokine/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*metabolism', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', '*Signal Transduction']",1997/08/08 00:00,1997/08/08 00:01,['1997/08/08 00:00'],"['1997/08/08 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/08/08 00:01 [medline]', '1997/08/08 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.272.32.19982 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(18)38879-3 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1997 Aug 8;272(32):19982-6. doi: 10.1074/jbc.272.32.19982.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For instance, peptidoglycan is capable of stimulating peripheral blood cells to release pro-inflammatory cytokines and is capable of inducing chronic arthritis in an animal model. In a previous study we found that degradation of peptidoglycan by purified NAMLAA reduced its inflammatory effects. To determine where NAMLAA is located in tissues, monoclonal antibodies against purified NAMLAA were produced for use in immunohistochemistry, immunoelectron microscopy, flow cytometric analysis, and Western blotting. The immunohistochemical studies showed NAMLAA-positive cells in human spleen, liver, arthritic synovial tissues, and lymph nodes. In flow cytometric studies of blood and bone marrow, neutrophilic and eosinophilic granulocytes proved to be positive. Monocytes were negative, although they do contain lysozyme, the other important peptidoglycan-degrading enzyme. However, mature macrophages obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage and subsequent selection based on autofluorescence did possess NAMLAA. In immunocytochemical staining of blood smears, thrombocytes were also positive for NAMLAA. Western blot analysis and immunoelectron microscopy of neutrophils and eosinophils showed that NAMLAA is located in azurophilic granules of neutrophils and in secretory vesicles and crystalloid-containing granules of eosinophils. Flow cytometric analysis of blood and bone marrow from different French-American-British-classified acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients showed that AML-M2 myeloblasts were the first in the granulocyte maturation lineage that were positive for NAMLAA. The more immature AML, such as AML-M0 and AML-M1, did not express NAMLAA. CD15- and CD13-negative megakaryoblasts, corresponding to AML-M7, were also positive for NAMLAA. The expression pattern of NAMLAA in the myeloid lineage suggests that the monoclonal antibody AAA4, recognizing NAMLAA, is useful for discrimination between AML in the monocyte lineage and in the granulocyte lineage.","['Hoijer, M A', 'Melief, M J', 'Calafat, J', 'Roos, D', 'van den Beemd, R W', 'van Dongen, J J', 'Hazenberg, M P']","['Hoijer MA', 'Melief MJ', 'Calafat J', 'Roos D', 'van den Beemd RW', 'van Dongen JJ', 'Hazenberg MP']","['Department of Immunology, Erasmus University Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Peptidoglycan)', 'EC 3.5.1.28 (N-Acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine Amidase)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Arthritis/enzymology/pathology', 'Biomarkers', 'Blood Platelets/*enzymology/ultrastructure', 'Bone Marrow/enzymology', 'Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Wall/*metabolism', 'Eosinophils/enzymology/ultrastructure', 'Granulocytes/*enzymology/ultrastructure', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Techniques', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/enzymology/pathology', 'Lymphoid Tissue/enzymology', 'Macrophages, Alveolar/*enzymology/ultrastructure', 'N-Acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine Amidase/analysis/*biosynthesis/genetics/immunology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/enzymology/ultrastructure', 'Neutrophils/enzymology/ultrastructure', 'Organ Specificity', 'Peptidoglycan/metabolism', 'Synovial Membrane/enzymology']",1997/08/01 00:00,1997/08/01 00:01,['1997/08/01 00:00'],"['1997/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)58141-X [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1997 Aug 1;90(3):1246-54.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This difference likely explains the increased sensitivity of lymphoid leukemias to short-term exposure of MTX as compared with myeloid leukemias. In this study, we examined the basis for differences between long chain MTX polyglutamate accumulation between different leukemia cell types using both leukemia cell lines and blasts freshly isolated from blood of leukemic patients. The major difference found between leukemia cells that accumulate long chain polyglutamates and those that do not were differences in Km values for the enzyme folylpolyglutamate synthetase. Km values did not change with partial purification of this enzyme, indicating that interfering substances in crude lysates were not responsible for this difference. We postulate that there may be differences in the properties of this enzyme related to tissue specific expression. In contrast to MTX, both Tomudex (Zeneca Pharmaceuticals, Wilmington, DE) and 1843U89, potent inhibitors of thymidylate synthetase, have low Kms for folylpolyglutamate synthetase, and polyglutamate forms of these inhibitors are accumulated to the same degree in both myeloid and lymphoid acute leukemia cells, paralleling the equivalent cytotoxicity found between myeloid and lymphoid leukemia cell lines. Based on these results, we believe a clinical trial of Tomudex in patients with acute myeloid leukemia is warranted.","['Longo, G S', 'Gorlick, R', 'Tong, W P', 'Ercikan, E', 'Bertino, J R']","['Longo GS', 'Gorlick R', 'Tong WP', 'Ercikan E', 'Bertino JR']","['Department of Molecular Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Folic Acid Antagonists)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Isoindoles)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Quinazolines)', '0 (Thiophenes)', '139987-54-5 (1843U89)', 'EC 2.1.1.45 (Thymidylate Synthase)', 'EC 6.3.2.- (Peptide Synthases)', 'EC 6.3.2.17 (folylpolyglutamate synthetase)', 'FCB9EGG971 (raltitrexed)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Folic Acid Antagonists/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells/drug effects/enzymology', 'Humans', 'Indoles/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Isoindoles', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism/pathology', 'Methotrexate/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Organ Specificity', 'Peptide Synthases/antagonists & inhibitors/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*metabolism/pathology', 'Quinazolines/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Thiophenes/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Thymidylate Synthase/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/08/01 00:00,1997/08/01 00:01,['1997/08/01 00:00'],"['1997/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)58140-8 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1997 Aug 1;90(3):1241-5.,,,['CA09512/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Marrow aspirates from 23 patients with T-ALL diagnosed consecutively from 1982 to 1994 at the Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University of Catania, Italy, were obtained at diagnosis, at the end of induction therapy (6 to 7 weeks after diagnosis), at consolidation and/or reinforced reinduction (12 to 15 weeks after diagnosis), at the beginning of maintenance therapy (34 to 40 weeks after diagnosis), and at the end of therapy (96 to 104 weeks after diagnosis). DNA from the patients' marrow was screened using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the four most common TCR delta rearrangements in T-ALL (Vdelta1 Jdelta1, Vdelta2 Jdelta1, Vdelta3 Jdelta1, and Ddelta2 Jdelta1) and, when negative, further tested for the presence of other possible TCR delta and TCR gamma rearrangements. After identification of junctional rearrangements involving V, D, and J segments by DNA sequencing, clone-specific oligonucleotide probes 5' end-labeled either with fluorescein or with [gamma-32P]ATP were used for heminested PCR or dot hybridization of PCR products of marrows from patients in clinical remission. For 17 patients with samples that were informative at the molecular level, the estimated relapse-free survival (RFS) at 5 years was 48.6% (+/-12%). The sensitivity and specificity for detection of MRD relating to the outcome were 100% and 88.9% for the heminested fluorescence PCR and 71.4% and 88.9% for Southern/dot blot hybridization, respectively. Predictive negative and positive values were 100% and 90.7% for heminested fluorescence PCR, respectively. The probability of RFS based on evidence of MRD as detected by heminested fluorescence PCR at the time of initiation of maintenance therapy was 100% and 0% for MRD-negative and MRD-positive patients, respectively. Thus, the presence of MRD at the beginning of maintenance therapy is a strong predictor of poor outcome, and the molecular detection of MRD at that time might represent the basis for a therapeutic decision about such patients. By contrast, the absence of MRD at any time after initiation of treatment strongly correlates with a favorable outcome. The heminested fluorescence PCR appears to be more accurate and more rapid than other previously used methods for the detection of residual leukemia.","['Dibenedetto, S P', 'Lo Nigro, L', 'Mayer, S P', 'Rovera, G', 'Schiliro, G']","['Dibenedetto SP', 'Lo Nigro L', 'Mayer SP', 'Rovera G', 'Schiliro G']","['Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University of Catania, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'Q573I9DVLP (Leucovorin)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)', 'AIEOP 8703 protocol', 'AIEOP acute lymphoblastic leukemia protocol', 'LSA2-L2 protocol']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/administration & dosage', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Blotting, Southern/*methods', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Evaluation Studies as Topic', 'Female', 'Fluorometry', '*Gene Rearrangement, delta-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor', '*Gene Rearrangement, gamma-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Italy/epidemiology', 'Leucovorin/administration & dosage', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/drug therapy/genetics/mortality/*pathology', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/administration & dosage', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*chemistry/pathology', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization/*methods', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta/analysis/*genetics', 'Remission Induction', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",1997/08/01 00:00,1997/08/01 00:01,['1997/08/01 00:00'],"['1997/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)58138-X [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1997 Aug 1;90(3):1226-32.,,,['CA10815/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because wt1 has been shown to be expressed in the vast majority of patients with acute myeloid leukemias (AML), we investigated the relevance of wt-1 mRNA expression regarding prognosis and possible prediction of relapse during follow-up. Totally bone marrow-derived blasts of 139 AML patients (129 newly diagnosed AML patients, 22 AML patients again in first relapse, and 10 AML patients analyzed primarily in first relapse) were studied for wt1 mRNA expression. Seventy-seven patients were analyzed for wt1 mRNA expression during follow-up. wt1-specific reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed and the amplification product was visually classified as not, weakly, moderately, or strongly amplified, as described previously. PCR products were quantitated by competitive PCR using a shortened homologous wt1 construct standard in representative cases. The expression of wt1 transcripts was correlated to age, French-American-British (FAB) subtype, phenotype, karyotype, and long-term survival. wt1 mRNA was detectable in 124 of 161 (77%) samples at diagnosis and in first relapse. wt1 expression was independent from age, antecedent myelodysplastic syndrome or FAB subtype, with the exception of a significant difference in M5 leukemias showing wt1 transcripts in only 40% (P = .0025). There was no correlation between the level of wt1 mRNA and response to treatment or the prognostic groups defined by the karyotype. Concerning long-term survival, patients with high levels of wt1 had a significantly worse overall survival (OS) than those with not detectable or low levels. The 3-year OS for all newly diagnosed AMLs was 13% and 38% (P = .038), respectively, and 12% and 43% (P = .014) for de novo AMLs. The difference was more distinct in patients less than 60 years of age. During follow-up, all patients achieving complete remission became wt1 negative. Reoccurrence of wt1 transcripts predicted relapse. The data indicate that high expression of wt1 mRNA is associated with a worse long-term prognosis.","['Bergmann, L', 'Miething, C', 'Maurer, U', 'Brieger, J', 'Karakas, T', 'Weidmann, E', 'Hoelzer, D']","['Bergmann L', 'Miething C', 'Maurer U', 'Brieger J', 'Karakas T', 'Weidmann E', 'Hoelzer D']","['Medical Clinic III, Hematology/Oncology, J.W.

The genes involved in this translocation are ERG on chromosome 21 and TLS/FUS on chromosome 16. The rearrangement of the two chromosomes forms the TLS/FUS-ERG fusion gene and produces a consistent chimeric transcript on the der (21) chromosome. In this study, we analyzed the clinical characteristics of 19 patients with t(16;21)-AML, including 2 patients who evolved from myelodysplastic syndrome, and detected the chimeric transcripts of the TLS/FUS-ERG fusion gene in the patients during various clinical stages by the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) technique. We found that the patients with t(16;21) are characterized by a relatively younger age (median age, 22 years old), involvement of various subtypes of French-American-British classification and a poor prognosis: 18 of the 19 patients died of the disease (median survival was 16 months). Four types of TLS/FUS-ERG chimeric transcripts including a novel type were noted in the RT-PCR analysis. The novel transcript contained an additional 138 nucleotides consisting of TLS/FUS exon 8 and ERG exons 7 and 8 and had an in-frame fusion. These chimeric transcripts were consistently detectable in the samples obtained not only at diagnosis and relapse but also in short and long complete remission, suggesting that t(16;21)-AML is resistant to conventional chemotherapy. Thus, we recommend that t(16;21) should be monitored by RT-PCR even in clinical remission and the patients should be treated by other more powerful modality like stem-cell transplantation in the first remission.","['Kong, X T', 'Ida, K', 'Ichikawa, H', 'Shimizu, K', 'Ohki, M', 'Maseki, N', 'Kaneko, Y', 'Sako, M', 'Kobayashi, Y', 'Tojou, A', 'Miura, I', 'Kakuda, H', 'Funabiki, T', 'Horibe, K', 'Hamaguchi, H', 'Akiyama, Y', 'Bessho, F', 'Yanagisawa, M', 'Hayashi, Y']","['Kong XT', 'Ida K', 'Ichikawa H', 'Shimizu K', 'Ohki M', 'Maseki N', 'Kaneko Y', 'Sako M', 'Kobayashi Y', 'Tojou A', 'Miura I', 'Kakuda H', 'Funabiki T', 'Horibe K', 'Hamaguchi H', 'Akiyama Y', 'Bessho F', 'Yanagisawa M', 'Hayashi Y']","['Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tokyo, Bunkyo-ku, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (ERG protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (RNA-Binding Protein FUS)', '0 (TLS-ERG fusion protein, human)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Transcriptional Regulator ERG)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 16/*genetics/ultrastructure', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21/*genetics/ultrastructure', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', '*DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/blood/drug therapy/*genetics/mortality/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Messenger/*analysis/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/*analysis/genetics', '*RNA-Binding Protein FUS', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Analysis', '*Trans-Activators', '*Transcription Factors', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transcriptional Regulator ERG', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'Treatment Failure']",1997/08/01 00:00,1997/08/01 00:01,['1997/08/01 00:00'],"['1997/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)58134-2 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1997 Aug 1;90(3):1192-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These proteins, which are present in different lengths of PML (amino acids 1-552 and 1-394, respectively), contain most of the functional domains of PML and RAR alpha, bind all-trans-retinoic acid (t-RA), and act as t-RA-dependent transcription factors. T-RA is an effective inducer of clinical remission only in patients carrying the t(15;17) and expressing the PML/RAR alpha products. However, in APL patients achieving complete remission with t-RA therapy the bcr3-PML/RAR alpha product has been found associated with a poorer prognosis than bcr1-PML/RAR alpha. In the present study we have investigated the structural and functional properties of the bcr3-PML/RAR alpha in comparison to the previously characterized bcr1-PML/RAR alpha. In particular, we have measured the binding properties of the two endogenous ligands t-RA and 9-cis-RA to both of these isoforms. T-RA binding analysis of nuclear and cytosolic extracts prepared from bcr3-PML/RAR alpha APL patients and from bcr3-PML/RAR alpha COS-1 transfected cells indicates that this protein is present only as high-molecular-weight nuclear complexes. Using saturation binding assays and Scatchard analyses we found that t-RA binds with slightly less affinity to the bcr3-PML/RAR alpha receptor than to bcr1-PML/RAR alpha or RAR alpha (Kd = 0.4 nmol/L, 0.13 nmol/L or 0.09 nmol/L, respectively). Moreover, two different high-affinity 9-cis-RA binding sites (Kd = 0.45 and 0.075 nmol/L) were detectable in the bcr3-PML/RAR alpha product but not in the bcr1-PML/RAR alpha product (Kd = 0.77 nmol/L). By competition binding experiments we showed that 9-cis-RA binds with higher specificity to the bcr3-PML/RAR alpha isoform than to the bcr1-PML/RAR alpha or RAR alpha. Consistent with these data, the binding of 9-cis-RA to the bcr3-PML/RAR alpha product resulted in increased transcriptional activation of the RA-responsive element (RARE) TRE, but not of the betaRARE, in transiently transfected COS-1 cells. These results provide evidence indicating that preferential retinoid binding to the different PML/RAR alpha products can be measured.","['Benedetti, L', 'Levin, A A', 'Scicchitano, B M', 'Grignani, F', 'Allenby, G', 'Diverio, D', 'Lo Coco, F', 'Avvisati, G', 'Ruthardt, M', 'Adamo, S', 'Pelicci, P G', 'Nervi, C']","['Benedetti L', 'Levin AA', 'Scicchitano BM', 'Grignani F', 'Allenby G', 'Diverio D', 'Lo Coco F', 'Avvisati G', 'Ruthardt M', 'Adamo S', 'Pelicci PG', 'Nervi C']","['Department of Histology and Medical Embryology, University La Sapienza, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '147855-37-6 (ZBTB16 protein, human)', '1UA8E65KDZ (Alitretinoin)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Alitretinoin', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/metabolism/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Binding, Competitive', 'COS Cells', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 15/genetics/ultrastructure', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17/genetics/ultrastructure', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/classification/*metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/classification/*metabolism', 'Prognosis', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein', 'Protein Binding', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Remission Induction', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Tretinoin/*metabolism/pharmacology/therapeutic use']",1997/08/01 00:00,1997/08/01 00:01,['1997/08/01 00:00'],"['1997/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)58132-9 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1997 Aug 1;90(3):1175-85.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we present a mechanism of action for NAC in cancer. Our data show that NAC (1) induces an early and sustained increase of membrane tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) expression on human stimulated-peripheral blood (PB) T cells and (2) increases membrane TNF-RI and TNF-RII on tumoral cell lines and on T cells after stimulation. These effects result from an early inhibition of both TNF alpha and TNF-R shedding, as well as a later increase of the respective mRNA expression. Consequently, NAC confers cytotoxic properties to human PB T cells through a membrane TNF alpha-dependent pathway. In vivo, NAC given orally inhibits tumor appearance in more than a third (18 out of 50) B6D2F1 mice injected with L1210 lymphoma cells. Spleen cells from protected mice killed L1210 lymphoma cells in vitro in a membrane TNF alpha-dependent manner. Furthermore these mice were resistant to a second inoculation of L1210 cells without further treatment with NAC. Thus, NAC exhibits a potent antitumoral activity by modulating TNF alpha and TNF-R processing without showing any in vitro and in vivo toxicity.","['Delneste, Y', 'Jeannin, P', 'Potier, L', 'Romero, P', 'Bonnefoy, J Y']","['Delneste Y', 'Jeannin P', 'Potier L', 'Romero P', 'Bonnefoy JY']","['Geneva Biomedical Research Institute, Glaxo Wellcome Research and Development SA, Immunology Department, Switzerland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Adjuvants, Immunologic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', 'WYQ7N0BPYC (Acetylcysteine)']",IM,"['Acetylcysteine/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Adjuvants, Immunologic/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy/immunology/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/biosynthesis/genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*drug effects/immunology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology']",1997/08/01 00:00,1997/08/01 00:01,['1997/08/01 00:00'],"['1997/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)58126-3 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1997 Aug 1;90(3):1124-32.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The identification of leukemia cell-reactive T cells and their ligands are, therefore, crucial for the development of new anti leukemia strategies. Here we describe a leukemia-reactive allo-HLA class II restricted CD4+ T-cell clone, 6.2, isolated from a healthy individual after stimulation with allogeneic leukemic cells. Clone 6.2 recognizes leukemic cells from several AML patients without showing reactivity to unfractioned peripheral blood mononuclear cells, monocytes, B cells, T-cell blasts, and proximal tubulus epithelial cells. Interestingly, clone 6.2 also recognizes BM cells derived from healthy individuals and inhibits the colony formation of myeloid and erythroid cell lineages. In the BM, clone 6.2 recognizes only CD34+ early precursor cells but not CD34-, more differentiated cells. Thus, the target antigen of clone 6.2 is developmentally regulated and expressed only by leukemic cells and CD34+ early progenitor cells in the hematopoietic system. We suggest that targeting the T-cell immune response to leukemia-associated, developmentally regulated antigens of the hematopoietic system can provide a basis for the separation of GVL from GVHD, and may lead to new therapeutic approaches for residual and relapsed leukemia.","['Mutis, T', 'Schrama, E', 'van Luxemburg-Heijs, S A', 'Falkenburg, J H', 'Melief, C J', 'Goulmy, E']","['Mutis T', 'Schrama E', 'van Luxemburg-Heijs SA', 'Falkenburg JH', 'Melief CJ', 'Goulmy E']","['Department of Immunohematology and Blood Bank, Leiden University Hospital, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*immunology', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Clone Cells/immunology', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Graft vs Host Reaction', 'HLA-DR Antigens/*immunology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*immunology', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*immunology/pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*immunology']",1997/08/01 00:00,1997/08/01 00:01,['1997/08/01 00:00'],"['1997/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)58121-4 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1997 Aug 1;90(3):1083-90.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although it is well known that the specific receptor for prostacyclin (PGI2-R) is abundantly expressed on platelets, PGI2-R expression in megakaryocytes is poorly understood. In this study, we examined its expression in leukemic or normal megakaryocytes. PGI2-R mRNA was expressed in human leukemic cell lines of megakaryocytic nature as evaluated by Northern blot analysis. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-3, IL-6, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), thrombopoietin (TPO), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) enhanced PGI2-R mRNA expression. The enhancement of PGI2-R expression by PMA and TPO was associated with the upregulation of platelet factor 4 or glycoprotein IIb mRNA expression. Iloprost, an agonist of prostacyclin, induced significant cyclic (c)AMP synthesis in these leukemic cells indicating that interaction of PGI2-R and its ligand can induce postreceptor signal transduction. Furthermore, iloprost-induced cAMP synthesis was enhanced by the pretreatment with PMA or the cytokines that promoted PGI2-R expression. PMA and TPO also increased the specific binding of [3H]iloprost to these cells. Pooled normal megakaryocytic colonies from TPO-containing semisolid culture of purified human CD34+ cells expressed PGI2-R, which were increased as the megakaryocytes matured with the peak expression before proplatelet formation, as evaluated by semiquantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). These results indicate that PGI2-R is expressed in human megakaryocytes and is upregulated by cytokines involved in thrombopoiesis or inflammation. Also, it was indicated that megakaryocytic maturation accompanies enhancement of PGI2-R expression.","['Sasaki, Y', 'Takahashi, T', 'Tanaka, I', 'Nakamura, K', 'Okuno, Y', 'Nakagawa, O', 'Narumiya, S', 'Nakao, K']","['Sasaki Y', 'Takahashi T', 'Tanaka I', 'Nakamura K', 'Okuno Y', 'Nakagawa O', 'Narumiya S', 'Nakao K']","['Department of Medicine and Clinical Science, Kyoto University Graduate School of Medicine, College of Medical Technology, Kyoto University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Interleukins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Platelet Glycoprotein GPIIb-IIIa Complex)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Receptors, Epoprostenol)', '0 (Receptors, Prostaglandin)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '1F7A44V6OU (Colforsin)', '37270-94-3 (Platelet Factor 4)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '9014-42-0 (Thrombopoietin)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'JED5K35YGL (Iloprost)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Colforsin/pharmacology', 'Cyclic AMP/biosynthesis', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/pathology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Iloprost/pharmacology', 'Interleukins/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/pathology', 'Megakaryocytes/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Platelet Factor 4/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Platelet Glycoprotein GPIIb-IIIa Complex/biosynthesis/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'RNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Receptors, Epoprostenol', 'Receptors, Prostaglandin/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Thrombopoietin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology']",1997/08/01 00:00,1997/08/01 00:01,['1997/08/01 00:00'],"['1997/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)58116-0 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1997 Aug 1;90(3):1039-46.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Median age was 37.8 years (range, 2.2 to 73.9). Induction treatment consisted of oral all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), 45 mg/m2/d until complete remission (CR), given with intravenous Idarubicin, 12 mg/m2/d on days 2, 4, 6, and 8. Three polychemotherapy cycles were given as consolidation. Hematologic and molecular response by RT-PCR was assessed after induction and after consolidation. At the time of analysis, 240 of the 253 eligible patients were evaluable for induction. Of these, 11 (5%) died of early complications and 229 (95%) achieved hematologic remission. No cases of resistant leukemia were observed. Of 139 cases studied by RT-PCR after induction, 84 (60.5%) were PCR-negative and 55 (39.5%) PCR-positive. One hundred sixty-two patients were evaluable by RT-PCR at the end of consolidation. Of these, 159 (98%) tested PCR-negative and 3 (2%), PCR-positive. After a median follow up of 12 months (range, 0 to 33), the estimated actuarial event-free survival for the whole series of 253 eligible patients was 83% +/- 2.6% and 79% +/- 3.2% at 1 and 2 years, respectively. This study indicates that the AIDA protocol is a well-tolerated regimen that induces molecular remission in almost all patients with PML/RAR alpha-positive APL.

We tested the efficacy of a new synthetic retinoid, Am80, in APL that had relapsed from CR induced by ATRA in a prospective multicenter study. Am80 is approximately 10 times more potent than ATRA as an in vitro differentiation inducer, is more stable to light, heat, and oxidation than ATRA, has a low affinity for cellular retinoic acid binding protein, and does not bind to retinoic acid receptor-gamma. Patients received Am80, 6 mg/m2, orally alone daily until CR. Of 24 evaluable patients, 14 (58%) achieved CR. The interval from the last ATRA therapy was not different between CR and failure cases.

It has recently been postulated that many chemotherapeutic agents also induce cell death by activating the Fas/FasL pathway. In the present study we compared apoptotic pathways induced by anti-Fas or chemotherapeutic agents in the Jurkat human T-cell leukemia line. Immunoblotting showed that treatment of wild-type Jurkat cells with anti-Fas or the topoisomerase II-directed agent etoposide resulted in proteolytic cleavage of precursors for the cysteine-dependent aspartate-directed proteases caspase-3 and caspase-7 and degradation of the caspase substrates poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and lamin B1. Likewise, affinity labeling with N-(N(alpha)-benzyloxycarbonylglutamyl-N(epsilon)-biotinyllysyl+ ++)aspartic acid [(2,6-dimethyl-benzoyl)oxy]methyl ketone [Z-EK(bio)D-amok] labeled the same five active caspase species after each treatment, suggesting that the same downstream apoptotic pathways have been activated by anti-Fas and etoposide. Treatment with ZB4, an antibody that inhibits Fas-mediated cell death, failed to block etoposide-induced apoptosis, raising the possibility that etoposide does not initiate apoptosis through Fas/FasL interactions. To further explore the relationship between Fas- and chemotherapy-induced apoptosis, Fas-resistant Jurkat cells were treated with various chemotherapeutic agents. Multiple independently derived Fas-resistant Jurkat lines underwent apoptosis that was indistinguishable from that of the Fas-sensitive parental cells after treatment with etoposide, doxorubicin, topotecan, cisplatin, methotrexate, staurosporine, or gamma-irradiation. These results indicate that antineoplastic treatments induce apoptosis through a Fas-independent pathway even though Fas- and chemotherapy-induced pathways converge on common downstream apoptotic effector molecules.","['Eischen, C M', 'Kottke, T J', 'Martins, L M', 'Basi, G S', 'Tung, J S', 'Earnshaw, W C', 'Leibson, P J', 'Kaufmann, S H']","['Eischen CM', 'Kottke TJ', 'Martins LM', 'Basi GS', 'Tung JS', 'Earnshaw WC', 'Leibson PJ', 'Kaufmann SH']","['Department of Immunology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55901, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Affinity Labels)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (FASLG protein, human)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Lamin Type B)', '0 (Lamins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (N-(N-(alpha)-benzyloxycarbonylglutamyl-(epsilon)-biotinyllysyl)aspartic acid', '((2,6-dimethylbenzoyl)oxy)methyl ketone)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '0 (lamin B1)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '6SO6U10H04 (Biotin)', '7M7YKX2N15 (Topotecan)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP7 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 7)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)', 'XT3Z54Z28A (Camptothecin)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Affinity Labels', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/*physiology/radiation effects', 'Biotin/analogs & derivatives', 'Camptothecin/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspase 7', '*Caspases', 'Cisplatin/pharmacology', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/metabolism', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', 'Fas Ligand Protein', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', '*Lamin Type B', 'Lamins', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/pathology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*physiology', 'Methotrexate/pharmacology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/physiology', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Oligopeptides', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Staurosporine/pharmacology', 'Topoisomerase II Inhibitors', 'Topotecan', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/radiation effects', 'fas Receptor/*physiology']",1997/08/01 00:00,1997/08/01 00:01,['1997/08/01 00:00'],"['1997/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)58103-2 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1997 Aug 1;90(3):935-43.,,,"['073915/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', 'R01 CA069008/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA69008/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It caused a dose-dependent increase in the percentage of mitotic cells in parallel with a decrease in cell proliferation, like VCR. It also showed a dose-dependent inhibition of tubulin polymerization, which correlated well with the cell growth-inhibitory activity. 14C-labeled E7010 bound to purified tubulin, and this binding was inhibited by colchicine but not by VCR. However, its binding properties were different from those of colchicine, as well as those of VCR. E7010 was active against two kinds of VCR-resistant P388 cell lines, one of which showed multidrug resistance due to the overexpression of P-glycoprotein (resistant to Taxol), and the other did not show multidrug resistance (sensitive to Taxol). Furthermore, four E7010-resistant P388 cell lines showed no cross-resistance to VCR, a different pattern of resistance to podophyllotoxin, and collateral sensitivity to Taxol. Therefore, E7010 is a novel tubulin-binding agent that has a wider antitumor spectrum than VCR and has different properties from those of VCR or Taxol.","['Yoshimatsu, K', 'Yamaguchi, A', 'Yoshino, H', 'Koyanagi, N', 'Kitoh, K']","['Yoshimatsu K', 'Yamaguchi A', 'Yoshino H', 'Koyanagi N', 'Kitoh K']","['Tsukuba Research Laboratories, Eisai Co.

High levels of the antiapoptotic Bcl-x(L) or Bcl-2, relative to the proapoptotic Bax, have been shown to inhibit HIDAC-induced cleavage and activity of caspase-3 and apoptosis of the human acute myeloid leukemia HL-60 cells. In a previous report, we demonstrated this inhibition, using the control HL-60 (HL-60/neo) cells and their counterparts, HL-60/Bcl-x(L), which have enforced overexpression of Bcl-x(L) and a significantly lower ratio of free to bound Bax. Results of the present studies demonstrate that, in the initiation phase of apoptosis of HL-60/neo cells due to HIDAC (10 or 100 microM for 4 h), cytochrome c is released from the mitochondria to the cytosol, followed by the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (deltapsi m) and an increase in the reactive oxygen species; these events precede and trigger the cleavage and activity of caspase-3. These HIDAC-induced early mitochondrial and cytosolic perturbations, which represent the initiation phase of HIDAC-induced apoptosis, were inhibited in HL-60/Bcl-x(L) cells. HIDAC treatment for 4 h also modestly increased the intracellular levels of free Bax relative to Bax bound to Bcl-2 and Bcl-x(L) in HL-60/neo but not in HL-60/Bcl-x(L) cells. In HL-60/neo cells, HIDAC-induced progressive accumulation of cytochrome c in the cytosol, the decrease in deltapsi m, and the increase in reactive oxygen species were not inhibited by coculture with the tetrapeptide inhibitors of caspases that have been previously shown to inhibit Ara-C-induced cleavage and activity of caspase-3 and apoptosis. These findings indicate that Bcl-x(L) inhibits HIDAC-induced preapoptotic mitochondrial perturbations, which prevent the accumulation of cytochrome c in the cytosol, thereby preserving caspase-3 in the inactive zymogen state and checking the molecular cascade of apoptosis.","['Kim, C N', 'Wang, X', 'Huang, Y', 'Ibrado, A M', 'Liu, L', 'Fang, G', 'Bhalla, K']","['Kim CN', 'Wang X', 'Huang Y', 'Ibrado AM', 'Liu L', 'Fang G', 'Bhalla K']","['Department of Medicine, Winship Cancer Center, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia 30322, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (AraC Transcription Factor)', '0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Bacterial Proteins)', '0 (Cytochrome c Group)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'AraC Transcription Factor', '*Bacterial Proteins', 'Blotting, Western', 'Caspase 3', '*Caspases', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/metabolism', 'Cytochrome c Group/*metabolism', 'Cytosol/metabolism', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects', 'Mitochondria/*enzymology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/*pharmacology', 'Time Factors', '*Transcription Factors', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein', 'bcl-X Protein']",1997/08/01 00:00,1997/08/01 00:01,['1997/08/01 00:00'],"['1997/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1997 Aug 1;57(15):3115-20.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we report the effect of overexpression of bcl-2 in U937 cells on the signaling pathway of apoptosis that is induced by bufalin. The results indicated that the apoptosis induced by bufalin in U937 cells was significantly inhibited by overexpression of the Bcl-2 protein. No significant difference was detected in the activation of MAPK kinase-1 that is induced by bufalin in wild-type or Bcl-2-overexpressed U937 cells; however, the activation of MAPK by bufalin was significantly attenuated in the cells overexpressing Bcl-2. Bufalin treatment activated activator protein-1 transcriptional activity; however, this activation was decreased to 40% in bcl-2-overexpressed U937 cells. These results indicate that Bcl-2 acts downstream of MAPK kinase-1 but upstream of MAPK and suggest that, in the signaling pathway of the apoptotic process induced by bufalin, the transcriptional activity of activator protein-1 may be down-regulated through the inhibition of MAPK activity by Bcl-2.","['Watabe, M', 'Kawazoe, N', 'Masuda, Y', 'Nakajo, S', 'Nakaya, K']","['Watabe M', 'Kawazoe N', 'Masuda Y', 'Nakajo S', 'Nakaya K']","['Laboratory of Biological Chemistry, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Showa University, Shinagawa-ku, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Bufanolides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-1)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases)', 'U549S98QLW (bufalin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Bufanolides/*pharmacology', 'Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/enzymology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases', 'Monocytes/enzymology', 'Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/*physiology', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Transcription Factor AP-1/metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/08/01 00:00,1997/08/01 00:01,['1997/08/01 00:00'],"['1997/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1997 Aug 1;57(15):3097-100.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, the expression of the APN gene in T cell lines as well as the induction of APN gene and surface expression in human peripheral T cells by mitogenic activation have been demonstrated. Here, by means of cytofluorimetric analysis evidence is provided, that the induction of APN surface expression is partially resistent to the action of the inhibitors of protein biosynthesis, puromycin and cycloheximide, and is not prevented by tunicamycin, an inhibitor of glycosylation. These data suggest that the rapid mitogen-induced surface expression of APN, detectable 20 hours after stimulation is dominated by mechanisms not dependent on de novo protein biosynthesis or glycosylation.

Transient expression assays, using B2-derived or intron-derived sequences independently or in conjunction, show that the B2 element has fortuitously unmasked a cryptic pre-mRNA 3'processing activity of silent intron sequences. The corresponding locus of the rat genome has been isolated and was shown to be devoid of any retroposon, which may explain why no soluble LIFR has yet been identified in any other species and further indicates that the B2 insertion event in the mouse LIFR gene has occurred recently during evolution. And yet, a tight tissue-specific regulation of alternative synthesis of soluble and membrane-bound LIFR mRNA has already emerged in mice.

The MoTN-PR3 vector particles released from a transfected packaging cell line contain RNAs with r-psi-U5 sequences at the 5'-end and U3-r sequences at the 3'-end. Upon infection, these vector particles can efficiently transduce the neomycin phosphotransferase (neo) gene to the target cells. The structure of the proviral DNA synthesized in these cells was shown to contain modified 5'- and 3'-LTRs with U3-r-psi-U5 sequences, indicating that this vector can undergo reverse transcription and integration. Analysis of psi signal-containing RNAs revealed that in addition to vector RNA transcribed from the MoMuLV 5'-LTR promoter, readthrough neo RNA transcribed from the internal herpes simplex virus (HSV) thymidine kinase (tk) promoter and cellular RNAs transcribed from the MoMuLV 3'-LTR promoter are produced. Of these, the downstream cellular RNAs are also packaged within the vector particles. These vector particles containing the vector and non-vector RNAs carrying the MoMuLV psi signal are non-infectious.

Eurocord Transplant Group and the European Blood and Marrow Transplantation Group.,373-81,"BACKGROUND: Cord-blood banks have increased the use of cord-blood transplantation in patients with hematologic disorders. We have established a registry containing information on the outcome of cord-blood transplantation. METHODS: We sent questionnaires to 45 transplantation centers for information on patients receiving cord-blood transplants from 1988 to 1996. Reports on 143 transplantations, performed at 45 centers, were studied, and the responses were analyzed separately according to whether the donor was related or unrelated to the recipient. RESULTS: Among 78 recipients of cord blood from related donors, the Kaplan-Meier estimate of survival at one year was 63 percent. Younger age, lower weight, transplants from HLA-identical donors, and cytomegalovirus-negative serologic results in the recipient were favorable prognostic factors. Graft-versus-host-disease of at least grade II occurred at estimated rates of 9 percent in 60 recipients of HLA-matched cord blood and 50 percent in 18 recipients of HLA-mismatched cord blood. Neutrophil engraftment was associated with an age of less than six years (P = 0.02) and a weight of less than 20 kg (P = 0.02), and it occurred in 85 percent of patients receiving 37 million or more nucleated cells per kilogram of body weight. Among 65 patients who received cord blood from unrelated donors, the Kaplan-Meier estimate of survival at one year was 29 percent. Cytomegalovirus-negative serologic status in these recipients was associated with improved survival (P = 0.03) and was the most important predictor of graft-versus-host disease (P = 0.04). Neutrophil recovery occurred in 94 percent of the patients who received 37 million or more nucleated cells per kilogram from unrelated donors. CONCLUSIONS: Cord blood is a feasible alternative source of hematopoietic stem cells for pediatric and some adult patients with major hematologic disorders, particularly if the donor and the recipient are related.","['Gluckman, E', 'Rocha, V', 'Boyer-Chammard, A', 'Locatelli, F', 'Arcese, W', 'Pasquini, R', 'Ortega, J', 'Souillet, G', 'Ferreira, E', 'Laporte, J P', 'Fernandez, M', 'Chastang, C']","['Gluckman E', 'Rocha V', 'Boyer-Chammard A', 'Locatelli F', 'Arcese W', 'Pasquini R', 'Ortega J', 'Souillet G', 'Ferreira E', 'Laporte JP', 'Fernandez M', 'Chastang C']","['Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,N Engl J Med,The New England journal of medicine,0255562,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Blood Donors', 'Cause of Death', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Data Collection', '*Fetal Blood/immunology', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/mortality/*statistics & numerical data', 'Histocompatibility/genetics', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/mortality/therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Recurrence', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",1997/08/07 00:00,1997/08/07 00:01,['1997/08/07 00:00'],"['1997/08/07 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/08/07 00:01 [medline]', '1997/08/07 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1056/NEJM199708073370602 [doi]'],ppublish,N Engl J Med. 1997 Aug 7;337(6):373-81. doi: 10.1056/NEJM199708073370602.,,,,['N Engl J Med. 2001 Jun 14;344(24):1870-1.

Trimethylenethiophosphoramide (thiotepa) is an alkylating agent that significantly inhibits platelet production. METHODS: The authors studied the effects of thiotepa in eight patients with CML with persistent thrombocythemia. All patients had adequate WBC counts while receiving therapy for leukemia. The median age of the patients was 58 years, and all had received at least 2 prior therapy regimens for CML. Thiotepa was administered by intravenous infusion at a dose of 75 mg/m2 once every 2 to 3 weeks; doses were adjusted according to hematologic response. RESULTS: Seven patients were evaluable for response to thiotepa. Their pretreatment median platelet count was 1215 x 10(9)/L. After receiving the first dose, 6 patients (86%) had favorable responses as the median platelet count dropped to 348 x 10(9)/L (P = 0.02). However, all the patients' platelet counts returned to near baseline values after the first course. Patients required a median of three courses to achieve stable platelet counts near the normal range. In 4 patients (57%), administration of thiotepa was discontinued because of a stable normal platelet count after a median of 7.5 courses; 1 patient was still receiving treatment at last follow-up (18 courses) and 2 patients stopped receiving treatment after their disease progressed to the blastic phase. Toxicity was mostly hematologic, with neutropenia (< or = 1 x 10(9)/L) occurring during 5 of the 64 courses (8%) administered but only 1 patient's course was complicated by fever. CONCLUSIONS: The authors conclude that thiotepa is useful in controlling thrombocythemia in CML patients who have elevated platelet counts despite having adequate WBC counts.","['Rodriguez-Monge, E J', 'Cortes, J E', ""O'Brien, S"", 'Talpaz, M', 'Kantarjian, H M']","['Rodriguez-Monge EJ', 'Cortes JE', ""O'Brien S"", 'Talpaz M', 'Kantarjian HM']","['Department of Hematology, University of Texas, M.

DESIGN: Routine histology, cytochemistry, and ultrastructural analysis were used to study this case. Immunoperoxidase studies for leukocyte common antigen (CD45), pan B-cell marker L26 (CD20), and hairy cell leukemia marker DBA.44 were performed. In addition, cell surface marker analysis for CD19, CD20, CD5, CD25, CD11c, and kappa and lambda light chains by flow cytometry was performed. RESULTS: The patient presented with typical clinical, morphologic, cytochemical, immunophenotypic, and ultrastructural features of hairy cell leukemia. Following splenectomy and prior to institution of any other therapy, he developed a blastic lymphoproliferative malignancy with loss of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase activity, expression of cell surface markers CD11c and CD25, and immunoreactivity for DBA.44. CONCLUSION: We believe this to be the first report of such a transformation and recommend that the differential diagnosis of blastic transformation of chronic lymphoproliferative disorders include such a possibility.","['Nazeer, T', 'Burkart, P', 'Dunn, H', 'Jennings, T A', 'Wolf, B']","['Nazeer T', 'Burkart P', 'Dunn H', 'Jennings TA', 'Wolf B']","['Department of Pathology, Albany Medical College, NY 12208, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Arch Pathol Lab Med,Archives of pathology & laboratory medicine,7607091,"['0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Antigens, CD20)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CD5 Antigens)', '0 (Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin lambda-Chains)', '0 (Integrin alphaXbeta2)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD19/analysis', 'Antigens, CD20/analysis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'CD5 Antigens/analysis', 'Histocytochemistry', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains/analysis', 'Immunoglobulin lambda-Chains/analysis', 'Integrin alphaXbeta2/analysis', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/immunology/metabolism/*pathology', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens/analysis', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/analysis', 'Spleen/pathology']",1997/07/01 00:00,1997/07/01 00:01,['1997/07/01 00:00'],"['1997/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Arch Pathol Lab Med. 1997 Jul;121(7):707-13.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between 1993 and 1995, 30 consecutive patients receiving an autologous peripheral stem-cell or bone marrow transplant (BMT) after high dose chemoradiotherapy were randomized to possibly receive prophylactic laser to the oral mucosa after giving informed consent. Chemotherapy consisted of cyclophosphamide, 60 mg/kg intravenously (I.V.) on day (d)-5 and d-4 in 27 cases, or melphalan 140 mg/kg I.V. on d-4 in three cases. Total body irradiation (TBI) consisted of 12 Gy midplane dose in six fractions (4 Gy/day for three days). He-Ne laser (632.8 nm wavelength, power 60 mW) applications were performed daily from d-5 to d-1 on five anatomic sites of the oral mucosa. Oral examination was performed daily from d0 to d + 20. Mucositis was scored according to an oral exam guide with a 16 item scale of which four were assessed by the patients themselves. Mean daily self assessment scores for oral pain, ability to swallow and oral dryness were measured. A daily mucositis index (DMI) and a cumulative oral mucositis score (COMS) were established. Requirement for narcotics and parenteral nutrition was recorded. RESULTS: The COMS was significantly reduced among laser treated (L+) patients (p = 0.04). The improvement of DMI in L+ patients was also statistically significant (p < 0.05) from d + 2 to d + 7. Occurrence and duration of grade III oral mucositis were reduced in L+ patients (p = 0.01). Laser applications reduced oral pain as assessed by patients (p = 0.05) and L+ patients required less morphine (p = 0.05). Xerostomia and ability to swallow were improved among the L+ patients (p = 0.005 and p = 0.01, respectively). Requirement for parenteral nutrition was not reduced (p = NS). CONCLUSION: Helium-Neon laser treatment was well tolerated, feasible in all cases, and reduced high dose chemoradiotherapy-induced oral mucositis. Optimal laser treatment schedules still needs to be defined.","['Cowen, D', 'Tardieu, C', 'Schubert, M', 'Peterson, D', 'Resbeut, M', 'Faucher, C', 'Franquin, J C']","['Cowen D', 'Tardieu C', 'Schubert M', 'Peterson D', 'Resbeut M', 'Faucher C', 'Franquin JC']","['Department of Radiotherapy, Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Cancer Center, Marseilles, France.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",United States,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",7603616,"['206GF3GB41 (Helium)', '4VB4Y46AHD (Neon)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Female', 'Helium', 'Humans', '*Laser Therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mouth Mucosa/radiation effects', 'Multiple Myeloma/therapy', 'Neon', 'Pain Measurement', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/therapy', 'Stomatitis/etiology/pathology/*prevention & control', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*adverse effects', 'Whole-Body Irradiation/*adverse effects']",1997/07/01 00:00,1997/07/01 00:01,['1997/07/01 00:00'],"['1997/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S036030169700076X [pii]', '10.1016/s0360-3016(97)00076-x [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1997 Jul 1;38(4):697-703. doi: 10.1016/s0360-3016(97)00076-x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Direct retroviral gene transfer to vascular cells in vivo has been limited by inefficient rates of transduction. We hypothesized that vascular cell transduction efficiency (TE), during short retroviral incubation periods, is significantly improved in vitro and in vivo using centrifugation to increase viral titer. Furthermore, we hypothesized a linear relationship between concentration of viable viral particles (measured as colony-forming units (CFUs)/cell) and retroviral TE during short incubation periods. Cultured rat pulmonary artery endothelial cells (RPAECs), rat aortic smooth muscle cells (RSMCs), and human iliac artery endothelial cells (HIAECs) demonstrated a strong correlation between TE and high concentrations of virus (> 100 CFU/cell) during retroviral incubation periods of 10 to 60 minutes. High titers, and thereby high concentrations, were achieved by centrifugation and resuspension in a fraction of the original volume. Titers was consistently increased tenfold, for a twentyfold increase in concentration by volume. A 20-minute incubation with a Moloney murine leukemia-derived retroviral vector coding for human placental alkaline phosphatase, pLJhpAP, at a concentration of 1150 CFU/cell yielded TEs of 10.6% +/- 0.7%, 40.4% +/- 1.6%, and 15.1% +/- 2.0% for RPAECs, RSMCs, and HIAECs, respectively. A similar effect was shown using the Moloney murine leukemia-derived MFGlacZ retroviral vector, coding for Escherichia coli beta-galactosidase. Increased titer and concentration had no effect on target cell viability, as shown by trypan blue exclusion. Although RSMCs had the most cells transduced in a given incubation period (p < 0.05), RPAECs had the highest replication rate (p < 0.05), suggesting the importance of factors other than cell cycle on retroviral TEs during short, clinically relevant incubation periods. In subsequent in vivo experiments, gene transfer was achieved in the rat carotid artery during a 20-minute incubation period infusing the concentrated pLJhpAP retrovirus after carotid balloon injury. Rats infused with virus 2 days after balloon injury exhibited hpAP activity (0 to 10 cells/section/rat) in the neointima of five out of six rats. Rats infused 4 days after balloon injury exhibited hpAP activity (0 to 25 cells/section/rat) in the media and adventitia of five out of five rats.

For example, in lymphoid tumors, rearrangement of the genomic DNA can lead to the juxtaposition of proto-oncogenes and the highly active sequences regulating synthesis of immunoglobulins or T-cell receptors. The subsequent malignancy results from an uncontrolled overexpression of a normal protein. This type of ""quantitative"" anomaly occurs in follicular lymphomas where B-cells overexpress the normal BCL2 protein which inhibits apoptosis, contributing to immortalization of the B done. The same type of rearrangement process can approach gene fragments which fusion and lead to production of a highly oncogenic chimerical or truncated abnormal protein. Such ""qualitative"" anomalies occur in myeloid hemopathies. Both types of anomalies involve genes controlling the cell cycle, cell differentiation or cell death (apoptosis), in particular transcription factors (for example, E2A, RARA, MYC) and molecules involved in signal transduction (for example RAS, ABL, LCK). A molecular anomaly can be detected in approximately 30% of all cases of acute leukemia and in up to 75% of the non-Hodgkin lymphomas. Analysis of the junction fragments of the different heavy chains of the immunoglobulins produced in these cases provides a specific marker for detecting the B or T-cell clone in digestive or skin biopsies. For example, detection of a BCR-ABL transcript in a patient with primary thrombocythemia or an atypical myeloproliferative syndrome can be diagnostic and detection of the donal immunoglobulin or T-cell receptor rearrangement can confirm the malignant nature of the lymphoid proliferation. Molecular markers also have prognostic value allowing patient stratification and more adapted therapy. Molecular anomalies detected in malignant hematologic diseases are thus examples of nearly perfect ""tumor-specific"" markers.","['Mauvieux, L', 'Macintyre, E']","['Mauvieux L', 'Macintyre E']",,['fre'],"['Editorial', 'English Abstract']",France,Presse Med,"Presse medicale (Paris, France : 1983)",8302490,,IM,"['Hematologic Neoplasms/diagnosis/*genetics/therapy', 'Humans', 'Molecular Biology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction']",1997/06/21 00:00,1997/06/21 00:01,['1997/06/21 00:00'],"['1997/06/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/06/21 00:01 [medline]', '1997/06/21 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Presse Med. 1997 Jun 21;26(21):1005-7.,,,,,,Les anomalies moleculaires dans les hemopathies malignes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

IL-2 and IFN-alpha are potent activators of the antitumour activity of natural killer (NK) cells but only rarely reduce the tumour burden in treated patients. Recent studies suggest that a reason why these cytokines are insufficiently effective in human cancer is that phagocytes inhibit the tumour-killing activity of NK cells at the site of the tumour. Histamine prevents the phagocyte-induced, NK cell-inhibiting signal; thus, histamine and IL-2 or histamine and IFN-alpha synergize to induce NK cell-mediated killing of human tumour cells in vitro. Further, treatment of tumour-bearing mice with histamine enhances IL-2- and IFN-alpha-induced destruction of NK cell-sensitive tumour cells in vivo. More than 50 patients with neoplastic disease have been treated with histamine, given in subcutaneous injections, together with IL-2 or IFN-alpha. The results of two pilot trials in metastatic melanoma suggest that the addition of histamine to IL-2 and IFN-alpha prolongs survival time and induces regression of tumours, such as liver melanoma, which are otherwise considered refractory to immunotherapy. The results of a trial in acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML) suggest that histamine and IL-2 protects AML patients against relapse of leukaemic disease. Histamine is well tolerated: for example, AML patients in remission have treated themselves with histamine at home without supervision for a total of > 300 weeks with only a handful of therapy-related hospital contacts. Controlled trials in melanoma and AML are under way to further investigate the putative benefit of histamine in neoplastic disease.","['Hellstrand, K', 'Hermodsson, S', 'Brune, M', 'Naredi, P', 'Carneskog, J', 'Mellqvist, U H']","['Hellstrand K', 'Hermodsson S', 'Brune M', 'Naredi P', 'Carneskog J', 'Mellqvist UH']","[""Department of Virology, Sahlgren's University Hospital, Goteborg, Sweden.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Scand J Clin Lab Invest,Scandinavian journal of clinical and laboratory investigation,0404375,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '820484N8I3 (Histamine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Histamine/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Active/*methods']",1997/05/01 00:00,1997/05/01 00:01,['1997/05/01 00:00'],"['1997/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/00365519709060027 [doi]'],ppublish,Scand J Clin Lab Invest. 1997 May;57(3):193-202. doi: 10.3109/00365519709060027.,55,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Messenger RNA of both LIFR beta and gp130 was detected in as little as 1/30 and 1/12 sample equivalents of cDNA respectively, in oocytes (n = 4), 4-cell and expanded, blastacyst stage embryos. LIFR beta but not gp130 transcripts were detected at the 2-, 8- and 10-cell stages, and in cavitating and hatched blastocysts. In order to exclude a simian origin of these PCR products resulting from the Vero cell line that was used as a feeder during culture to the blastocyst stage, they were digested with restriction endonucleases Taql (LIFR beta) or Kpnl (gp130). Their human origin was confirmed. The results support an earlier finding of LIFR beta mRNA expression in human blastocysts, and extend these results to earlier stages and oocytes. This is the first report of LIFR beta and gp130 transcription in human oocytes. Taken together these results demonstrate that transcription of LIFR beta and gp130 takes place throughout human preimplantation development, and suggest that functional LIF receptors might be present at these stages. These results further confirm the feasibility of performing mRNA phenotyping of multiple genes with RNA derived from a single preimplantation stage embryo.","['van Eijk, M J', 'Mandelbaum, J', 'Salat-Baroux, J', 'Belaisch-Allart, J', 'Plachot, M', 'Junca, A M', 'Mummery, C L']","['van Eijk MJ', 'Mandelbaum J', 'Salat-Baroux J', 'Belaisch-Allart J', 'Plachot M', 'Junca AM', 'Mummery CL']","['Hubrecht Laboratory, Netherlands Institue for Developmental Biology (NIOB), Utrecht, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Mol Hum Reprod,Molecular human reproduction,9513710,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (IL6ST protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (LIFR protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/*biosynthesis', 'Blastocyst/*metabolism', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130', 'DNA, Complementary/analysis', 'Female', '*Growth Inhibitors', 'Humans', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit', '*Lymphokines', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*biosynthesis', 'Oocytes/*metabolism', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Pregnancy', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Receptors, Cytokine/*biosynthesis', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF']",1996/05/01 00:00,1996/05/01 00:01,['1996/05/01 00:00'],"['1996/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/molehr/2.5.355 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Hum Reprod. 1996 May;2(5):355-60. doi: 10.1093/molehr/2.5.355.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Apoptosis-induced DNA fragmentation was detected by the TdT-mediated dUTP-biotin nick-end labelling method, and immunostaining with a monoclonal antibody against the Fas, Le(y) or B-cell leukaemia/lymphoma-2 (bcl-2) was also performed using the same tissue section. Analysis showed that apoptosis was occurring in all the samples of ovarian endometriotic tissue but in only two of the 12 adenomyotic and in five of the 24 eutopic endometrial tissue samples. In none of these cases was apoptosis correlated with phases of the menstrual cycle. The expression of bcl-2 in the eutopic endometrial and adenomyotic tissues was limited to the proliferative phase, and was observed in only one of the 12 cases of ovarian endometriosis. Fas and Ley were expressed randomly across a wide range in both the eutopic and ectopic endometrial tissues. These results suggest that the features of ovarian endometriosis are different from those of adenomyosis and eutopic endometrium in terms of the involvement of apoptosis. In addition, the regulatory mechanism involved in ovarian endometriosis may differ from that in other endometrial cells.","['Harada, M', 'Suganuma, N', 'Furuhashi, M', 'Nagasaka, T', 'Nakashima, N', 'Kikkawa, F', 'Tomoda, Y', 'Furui, K']","['Harada M', 'Suganuma N', 'Furuhashi M', 'Nagasaka T', 'Nakashima N', 'Kikkawa F', 'Tomoda Y', 'Furui K']","['Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Nagoya University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Mol Hum Reprod,Molecular human reproduction,9513710,['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)'],IM,"['Adult', '*Apoptosis', 'DNA Damage', 'Endometriosis/*pathology', 'Endometrium/metabolism/*pathology/ultrastructure', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism']",1996/05/01 00:00,1996/05/01 00:01,['1996/05/01 00:00'],"['1996/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/molehr/2.5.307 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Hum Reprod. 1996 May;2(5):307-15. doi: 10.1093/molehr/2.5.307.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Each OBOC library bead incorporates two orthogonally cleavable linkers that release the bead-bound compound at a different pH. The assay utilizes high concentrations of tumor cells mixed directly with OBOC beads and plated in soft agarose containing tissue culture medium. One of the orthogonal linkers is cleaved at neutral pH in tissue culture releasing an aliquot of compound to diffuse at a relatively high local concentration into the soft agarose immediately surrounding the bead. Active compounds are identified visually from a clear ring of tumor cell lysis which forms within 48 h around just the rare bead releasing a cytotoxic compound. The bead releasing a cytotoxin is then plucked from the agar and the remaining compound still linked to the bead can be released for structural analysis, followed by compound resynthesis and confirmatory testing. This assay system has been successfully applied to identification of lead cytotoxic compounds from model peptidic and non-peptidic combinatorial chemical libraries. Use of this methodology may facilitate anticancer drug discovery.","['Salmon, S E', 'Liu-Stevens, R H', 'Zhao, Y', 'Lebl, M', 'Krchnak, V', 'Wertman, K', 'Sepetov, N', 'Lam, K S']","['Salmon SE', 'Liu-Stevens RH', 'Zhao Y', 'Lebl M', 'Krchnak V', 'Wertman K', 'Sepetov N', 'Lam KS']","['Arizona Cancer Center, University of Arizona, Tucson 85724, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Mol Divers,Molecular diversity,9516534,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Peptide Library)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Breast Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Culture Techniques', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia P388/drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Microspheres', 'Multiple Myeloma/drug therapy', '*Peptide Library', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/10/01 00:00,1996/10/01 00:01,['1996/10/01 00:00'],"['1996/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF01718701 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Divers. 1996 Oct;2(1-2):57-63. doi: 10.1007/BF01718701.,,,"['CA-17094/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-23074/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UO-1 CA-57723/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PIG-A mutations result in absent or decreased cell surface expression of all GPI-anchored proteins. Although many of the clinical manifestations (e.g., hemolytic anemia) of the disease can be explained by a deficiency of GPI-anchored complement regulatory proteins such as CD59 and CD55, it is unclear why the PNH clone dominates hematopoiesis and why it is prone to evolve into acute leukemia. We found that PIG-A mutations confer a survival advantage by making cells relatively resistant to apoptotic death. When placed in serum-free medium, granulocytes and affected CD34(+) (CD59(-)) cells from PNH patients survived longer than their normal counterparts. PNH cells were also relatively resistant to apoptosis induced by ionizing irradiation. Replacement of the normal PIG-A gene in PNH cell lines reversed the cellular resistance to apoptosis. Inhibited apoptosis resulting from PIG-A mutations appears to be the principle mechanism by which PNH cells maintain a growth advantage over normal progenitors and could play a role in the propensity of this disease to transform into more aggressive hematologic disorders. These data also suggest that GPI anchors are important in regulating apoptosis.","['Brodsky, R A', 'Vala, M S', 'Barber, J P', 'Medof, M E', 'Jones, R J']","['Brodsky RA', 'Vala MS', 'Barber JP', 'Medof ME', 'Jones RJ']","['Johns Hopkins Oncology Center, Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, 600 North Wolfe Street, Baltimore, MD 21287-8967, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Glycosylphosphatidylinositols)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (phosphatidylinositol glycan-class A protein)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Glycosylphosphatidylinositols/metabolism', 'Hemoglobinuria, Paroxysmal/*genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Membrane Proteins/*genetics', '*Mutation']",1997/08/05 00:00,1997/08/05 00:01,['1997/08/05 00:00'],"['1997/08/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/08/05 00:01 [medline]', '1997/08/05 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.94.16.8756 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1997 Aug 5;94(16):8756-60. doi: 10.1073/pnas.94.16.8756.,,,"['P01 CA015396/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI023598/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI23598/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA15396/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC23114,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Gene therapy strategies are being developed that allow the transfer of exogenous genes into CD4(+) T lymphocytes whose expression might prevent viral infection or replication. Insights into the mechanisms that govern virus entry into the target cells can be exploited for this purpose. Major determinants of the tropism of infection are the CD4 molecules on the surface of the target cells and the viral envelope glycoproteins at the viral surface. The best characterized and most widely used gene transfer vectors are derived from Moloney murine leukemia virus (MuLV). To generate MuLV-based retroviral gene transfer vector particles with specificity of infection for CD4-expressing cells, we attempted to produce viral pseudotypes, consisting of MuLV capsid particles and the surface (SU) and transmembrane (TM) envelope glycoproteins gp120-SU and gp41-TM of HIV type 1 (HIV-1). Full-length HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins were expressed in the MuLV env-negative packaging cell line TELCeB6. Formation of infectious pseudotype particles was not observed. However, using a truncated variant of the transmembrane protein, lacking sequences of the carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic domain, pseudotyped retroviruses were generated. Removal of the carboxyl-terminal domain of the transmembrane envelope protein of HIV-1 was therefore absolutely required for the generation of the viral pseudotypes. The virus was shown to infect CD4-expressing cell lines, and infection was prevented by antisera specific for gp120-SU. This retroviral vector should prove useful for the study of HIV infection events mediated by HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins, and for the targeting of CD4(+) cells during gene therapy of AIDS.","['Schnierle, B S', 'Stitz, J', 'Bosch, V', 'Nocken, F', 'Merget-Millitzer, H', 'Engelstadter, M', 'Kurth, R', 'Groner, B', 'Cichutek, K']","['Schnierle BS', 'Stitz J', 'Bosch V', 'Nocken F', 'Merget-Millitzer H', 'Engelstadter M', 'Kurth R', 'Groner B', 'Cichutek K']","['Institut fur Experimentelle Krebsforschung, Klinik fur Tumorbiologie, Breisacher Strasse 117, D-79106 Freiburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (CD4 Antigens)', '0 (HIV Envelope Protein gp120)']",IM,"['CD4 Antigens/*immunology', 'Cell Line', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', '*Genetic Vectors', 'HIV Envelope Protein gp120/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Reassortant Viruses/genetics', 'Retroviridae Infections/genetics/immunology/*virology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/*virology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/genetics/immunology/*virology']",1997/08/05 00:00,1997/08/05 00:01,['1997/08/05 00:00'],"['1997/08/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/08/05 00:01 [medline]', '1997/08/05 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.94.16.8640 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1997 Aug 5;94(16):8640-5. doi: 10.1073/pnas.94.16.8640.,,,,,PMC23056,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Studies with a mechanism-based probe.,385-95,"The mechanisms that establish and maintain methylation patterns in the mammalian genome are very poorly understood, even though perturbations of methylation patterns lead to a loss of genomic imprinting, ectopic X chromosome inactivation, and death of mammalian embryos. A family of sequence-specific DNA methyltransferases has been proposed to be responsible for the wave of de novo methylation that occurs in the early embryo, although no such enzyme has been identified. A universal mechanism-based probe for DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferases was used to screen tissues and cell types known to be active in de novo methylation for new species of DNA methyltransferase. All identifiable de novo methyltransferase activity was found to reside in Dnmt1. As this enzyme is the predominant de novo methyltransferase at all developmental stages inspected, it does not fit the definition of maintenance methyltransferase or hemimethylase. Recent genetic data indicate that de novo methylation of retroviral DNA in embryonic stem cells is likely to involve one or more additional DNA methyltransferases. Such enzymes were not detected and are either present in very small amounts or are very different from Dnmt1. A new method was developed and used to determine the sequence specificity of intact Dnmt1 in whole-cell lysates. Specificity was found to be confined to the sequence 5'-CpG-3'; there was little dependence on sequence context or density of CpG dinucleotides. These data suggest that any sequence-specific de novo methylation mediated by Dnmt1 is either under the control of regulatory factors that interact with Dnmt1, or is cued by alternative secondary structures in DNA.","['Yoder, J A', 'Soman, N S', 'Verdine, G L', 'Bestor, T H']","['Yoder JA', 'Soman NS', 'Verdine GL', 'Bestor TH']","['Department of Genetics and Development, College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,J Mol Biol,Journal of molecular biology,2985088R,"['0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0W860991D6 (Deoxycytidine)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases)', 'J41CSQ7QDS (Zinc)', ""KUA4693H5W (5-fluoro-2'-deoxycytidine)""]",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'DNA/genetics/metabolism', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases/*metabolism', 'DNA Methylation', 'Deoxycytidine/analogs & derivatives', 'Embryonic and Fetal Development', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Mice', '*Molecular Probe Techniques', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides', 'Stem Cells/enzymology', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Zinc/metabolism']",1997/07/18 00:00,1997/07/18 00:01,['1997/07/18 00:00'],"['1997/07/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/07/18 00:01 [medline]', '1997/07/18 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0022-2836(97)91125-6 [pii]', '10.1006/jmbi.1997.1125 [doi]']",ppublish,J Mol Biol. 1997 Jul 18;270(3):385-95. doi: 10.1006/jmbi.1997.1125.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cartilage explants of patellae and femoral heads were incubated with IL-1 or LIF. Conditioned media were analysed for IL-6 activity (B9-assay) and NO content (Griess). Proteoglycan synthesis was assessed using [35S]sulfate incorporation. IL-1 dose dependently induced IL-6 synthesis and neutralizing IL-6 with antibodies did not reduce proteoglycan synthesis suppression, neither in explants nor in isolated chondrocytes. IL-6 independence was confirmed using cartilage from IL-6 deficient mice. IL-1 significantly increased NO release in normal and IL-6 deficient chondrocytes and addition of the NO synthase inhibitor, N(G)-monomethyl-L-arginine markedly alleviated proteoglycan synthesis suppression. LIF also induced proteoglycan synthesis suppression in cartilage from normal and IL-6 deficient mice, but the suppression was neither accompanied by nor dependent on NO release. Furthermore, proteoglycan synthesis suppression during experimental arthritis was similar in both normal and IL-6 deficient mice. We concluded that IL-6 is not a necessary cofactor in IL-1 and LIF induced suppression of proteoglycan synthesis. Furthermore, only the IL-1 induced suppression was mediated by NO, suggesting that inhibition of proteoglycan synthesis may occur through different pathways.","['Van de Loo, F A', 'Arntz, O J', 'Van den Berg, W B']","['Van de Loo FA', 'Arntz OJ', 'Van den Berg WB']","['Department of Rheumatology, University Hospital Nijmegen, The Netherlands.

The oral formulation has demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of advanced breast cancer, low-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, myelodysplastic syndromes and as first-line induction therapy of acute myelogenous leukaemia where intravenous anthracycline treatment is precluded. It also has potential in ameliorating blast crisis of chronic myelogenous leukaemia and in multiple myeloma. The most frequent adverse effects associated with oral idarubicin are those commonly found with anthracyclines, namely myelosuppression, nausea and vomiting, diarrhoea and mucositis. There appears to be minimal significant cardiotoxicity with oral idarubicia. In summary; available data concerning oral idarubicin in haematological malignancies and advanced breast cancer are sufficiently encouraging to warrant further research. To maximise the use of oral idarubicin, future studies should define the optimal dose for elderly patients, its comparative efficacy with other available regimens and address quality-of-life and pharmacoeconomic issues associated with the substitution of oral for intravenous chemotherapy.","['Buckley, M M', 'Lamb, H M']","['Buckley MM', 'Lamb HM']","['Adis International Limited, Auckland, New Zealand.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",New Zealand,Drugs Aging,Drugs & aging,9102074,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)']",IM,"['Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Breast Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Male']",1997/07/01 00:00,1997/07/01 00:01,['1997/07/01 00:00'],"['1997/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.2165/00002512-199711010-00006 [doi]'],ppublish,Drugs Aging. 1997 Jul;11(1):61-86. doi: 10.2165/00002512-199711010-00006.,125,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated primary childhood and adult leukemias (n = 44) and leukemic cell lines (n = 13) for the expression of the hGH receptor (hGHR) by immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry. All leukemias expressed the hGHR in the cytoplasm; expression on the surface was undetectable in some of the leukemias. In leukemic cell lines, hGHR expression on the surface was demonstrated in a dose-dependent manner after incubation with rhGH. Physiologic concentrations of hGH were more efficient than higher doses in increasing hGHR surface expression. A proliferative response to hGH was accomplished in cell lines REH, Molt4, and K562. However, only one of 19 primary leukemias (ALL, n = 12; AML, n = 7) showed increased cell counts after the addition of 50-800 ng/ml recombinant hGH (rhGH). These cells were of an immature T-cell phenotype. We thus conclude that acute leukemias can be stimulated by hGH to up-regulate its receptor, but that most primary leukemias may require additional signals for the induction of proliferation.","['Giesbert, S', 'Panzer, S', 'Kovar, H', 'Fischer, S', 'Printz, D', 'Gadner, H', 'Panzer-Grumayer, E R']","['Giesbert S', 'Panzer S', 'Kovar H', 'Fischer S', 'Printz D', 'Gadner H', 'Panzer-Grumayer ER']","[""Children's Cancer Research Institute, St. Anna Children's Hospital, Vienna, Austria.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (Receptors, Somatotropin)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '12629-01-5 (Human Growth Hormone)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Child', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique, Direct', 'Human Growth Hormone/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia/*metabolism/pathology', 'Receptors, Somatotropin/biosynthesis/*physiology', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/chemistry']",1997/06/01 00:00,1997/06/01 00:01,['1997/06/01 00:00'],"['1997/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s002770050295 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 1997 Jun;74(6):253-7. doi: 10.1007/s002770050295.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Approximately 1-4% of infected individuals develop disease, generally decades following infection. Increased proviral transcription, mediated by the viral 40-kDa trans-activating protein, Tax, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of HTLV-1-associated diseases. Since the HTLV-1 promoter contains sequences responsive to cyclic AMP and protein kinase C, we hypothesized that lymphocyte activation signals initiated through the TCR/CD3 complex or CD2 receptor promote viral replication in HTLV-1-infected lymphocytes. We demonstrate that mAbs directed against the CD2, but not the CD3 receptor increase viral p24 capsid protein 1.5- to 5.7-fold in CD2/CD3+ HTLV-1-infected cell culture supernatants. Northern blot analysis demonstrated a 2.5- to 4-fold increase in all species of viral mRNA following CD2 cross-linking of OSP2/4 cells, an immortalized HTLV-1 cell line. Consistent with transcriptional regulation, reporter gene activity increased approximately 11-fold in CD2-stimulated Jurkat T cells cotransfected with a Tax-expressing plasmid and a CAT reporter gene construct under control of the HTLV-1 promoter. These data suggest a possible physiologic mechanism, whereby CD2-mediated cell adhesion and lymphocyte activation may promote viral transcription in infected lymphocytes.","['Guyot, D J', 'Newbound, G C', 'Lairmore, M D']","['Guyot DJ', 'Newbound GC', 'Lairmore MD']","['Center for Retrovirus Research and Department of Veterinary Biosciences, College of Veterinary Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus 43210-1093, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,"['0 (CD2 Antigens)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (Cross-Linking Reagents)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '0 (p24 protein, Human T-lymphotropic virus 1)', 'EC 2.3.1.28 (Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase)']",IM,"['CD2 Antigens/*metabolism', 'CD3 Complex/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase/genetics', 'Cross-Linking Reagents', 'Gene Products, tax/genetics', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/metabolism/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'RNA, Viral/metabolism', 'Receptors, Immunologic/metabolism', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/biosynthesis', '*Signal Transduction', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/*virology', 'Transfection', '*Virus Replication']",1997/07/21 00:00,1997/07/21 00:01,['1997/07/21 00:00'],"['1997/07/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/07/21 00:01 [medline]', '1997/07/21 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0042-6822(97)98636-0 [pii]', '10.1006/viro.1997.8636 [doi]']",ppublish,Virology. 1997 Jul 21;234(1):123-9. doi: 10.1006/viro.1997.8636.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Studies of human alpha-globin mRNA stability have identified a specific RNP complex (alpha-complex) which forms on the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) of the mRNA and appears to regulate the erythrocyte-specific accumulation of alpha-globin mRNA. One of the protein activities in this multiprotein complex is a poly(C)-binding activity which consists of two proteins, alphaCP1 and alphaCP2. Neither of these proteins, individually or as a pair, can bind the alpha-globin 3'UTR unless they are complexed with the remaining non-poly(C) binding proteins of the alpha-complex. With the yeast two-hybrid screen, a second alpha-complex protein was identified. This protein is a member of the previously identified A+U-rich (ARE) binding/degradation factor (AUF1) family of proteins, which are also known as the heterogeneous nuclear RNP (hnRNP) D proteins. We refer to these proteins as AUF1/hnRNP-D. Thus, a protein implicated in ARE-mediated mRNA decay is also an integral component of the mRNA stabilizing alpha-complex. The interaction of AUF1/hnRNP-D is more efficient with alphaCP1 relative to alphaCP2 both in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that the alpha-complex might be dynamic rather than a fixed complex. AUF1/hnRNP-D could, therefore, be a general mRNA turnover factor involved in both stabilization and decay of mRNA.","['Kiledjian, M', 'DeMaria, C T', 'Brewer, G', 'Novick, K']","['Kiledjian M', 'DeMaria CT', 'Brewer G', 'Novick K']","['Department of Cell, Developmental and Neurobiology, Rutgers University, Piscataway, New Jersey 08855, USA. kiledjia@biology.rutgers.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (GAL4 protein, S cerevisiae)', '0 (HNRNPD protein, human)', '0 (Heterogeneous Nuclear Ribonucleoprotein D0)', '0 (Heterogeneous-Nuclear Ribonucleoprotein D)', '0 (Heterogeneous-Nuclear Ribonucleoproteins)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Multiprotein Complexes)', '0 (PCBP1 protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Ribonucleoproteins)', '0 (Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '30811-80-4 (Poly C)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)']",IM,"['*DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Globins/*genetics', 'Heterogeneous Nuclear Ribonucleoprotein D0', '*Heterogeneous-Nuclear Ribonucleoprotein D', 'Heterogeneous-Nuclear Ribonucleoproteins', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Multiprotein Complexes', 'Poly C/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/*metabolism', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Ribonucleoproteins/*metabolism', '*Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins', 'Transcription Factors/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/08/01 00:00,1997/08/01 00:01,['1997/08/01 00:00'],"['1997/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/MCB.17.8.4870 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1997 Aug;17(8):4870-6. doi: 10.1128/MCB.17.8.4870.,,,['CA52443/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,PMC232339,,,,,,,,['Mol Cell Biol 1997 Oct;17(10):6202'],,,,,,

APLs with the PML-RAR alpha or the PLZF-RAR alpha fusion protein are phenotypically indistinguishable except that they differ in their sensitivity to retinoic acid (RA)-induced differentiation: PML-RAR alpha blasts are sensitive to RA and patients enter disease remission after RA treatment, while patients with PLZF-RAR alpha do not. We here report that (i) like PML-RAR alpha expression, PLZF-RAR alpha expression blocks terminal differentiation of hematopoietic precursor cell lines (U937 and HL-60) in response to different stimuli (vitamin D3, transforming growth factor beta1, and dimethyl sulfoxide); (ii) PML-RAR alpha, but not PLZF-RAR alpha, increases RA sensitivity of hematopoietic precursor cells and restores RA sensitivity of RA-resistant hematopoietic cells; (iii) PML-RAR alpha and PLZF-RAR alpha have similar RA binding affinities; and (iv) PML-RAR alpha enhances the RA response of RA target genes (those for RAR beta, RAR gamma, and transglutaminase type II [TGase]) in vivo, while PLZF-RAR alpha expression has either no effect (RAR beta) or an inhibitory activity (RAR gamma and type II TGase). These data demonstrate that PML-RAR alpha and PLZF-RAR alpha have similar (inhibitory) effects on RA-independent differentiation and opposite (stimulatory or inhibitory) effects on RA-dependent differentiation and that they behave in vivo as RA-dependent enhancers or inhibitors of RA-responsive genes, respectively. Their different activities on the RA signalling pathway might underlie the different responses of PML-RAR alpha and PLZF-RAR alpha APLs to RA treatment. The PLZF-RAR alpha fusion protein contains an approximately 120-amino-acid N-terminal motif (called the POZ domain), which is also found in a variety of zinc finger proteins and a group of poxvirus proteins and which mediates protein-protein interactions. Deletion of the PLZF POZ domain partially abrogated the inhibitory effect of PLZF-RAR alpha on RA-induced differentiation and on RA-mediated type II TGase up-regulation, suggesting that POZ-mediated protein interactions might be responsible for the inhibitory transcriptional activities of PLZF-RAR alpha.","['Ruthardt, M', 'Testa, U', 'Nervi, C', 'Ferrucci, P F', 'Grignani, F', 'Puccetti, E', 'Grignani, F', 'Peschle, C', 'Pelicci, P G']","['Ruthardt M', 'Testa U', 'Nervi C', 'Ferrucci PF', 'Grignani F', 'Puccetti E', 'Grignani F', 'Peschle C', 'Pelicci PG']","['Istituto di Medicina Interna e Scienze Oncologiche, Policlinico Monteluce, Perugia University, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '0 (RARA protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '0 (retinoic acid receptor beta)', '0 (retinoic acid receptor gamma)', '147855-37-6 (ZBTB16 protein, human)', '1C6V77QF41 (Cholecalciferol)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 2.3.2.13 (Transglutaminases)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Cholecalciferol/pharmacology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Granulocytes/cytology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Monocytes/cytology', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/*physiology', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/genetics/physiology', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*physiology', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/pharmacology', 'Transglutaminases/metabolism', 'Tretinoin/metabolism/*pharmacology']",1997/08/01 00:00,1997/08/01 00:01,['1997/08/01 00:00'],"['1997/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/MCB.17.8.4859 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1997 Aug;17(8):4859-69. doi: 10.1128/MCB.17.8.4859.,,,,,PMC232338,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Among the Pbx proteins by themselves, only Pbx3 binds with high affinity, as a monomer or as a homodimer, to an optimal binding site, TGATTGATTTGAT. An inhibitory domain located N terminal of the Pbx1 homeodomain prevents intrinsic Pbx1 binding to this sequence. When complexed with Hoxc-6, each of the Pbx gene products binds the same consensus sequence, TGATTTAT, which differs from the site bound by Pbx3 alone. Three members of the Antennapedia family, Hoxc-6, Hoxb-7, and Hoxb-8, select the same binding site in conjunction with Pbx1. The affinities of these proteins as heterodimeric partners with Pbx1 for the selected optimal binding site are similar. However, the binding specificity of Hox proteins for optimal binding sites is increased, compared to nonspecific DNA, in the presence of Pbx proteins. Thus, while cooperative DNA binding involving heterodimers of Pbx and Hox gene products derived from members within the Antennapedia family does not increase binding site selectivity, DNA binding specificity of the Hox gene products is significantly enhanced in the presence of Pbx.","['Neuteboom, S T', 'Murre, C']","['Neuteboom ST', 'Murre C']","['Department of Biology, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla 92093, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Antennapedia Homeodomain Protein)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (PBX2 protein, human)', '0 (Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (pbx1 protein, human)', '146150-81-4 (proto-oncogene protein Pbx3)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Antennapedia Homeodomain Protein', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'DNA/chemistry/*metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Dimerization', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', '*Transcription Factors']",1997/08/01 00:00,1997/08/01 00:01,['1997/08/01 00:00'],"['1997/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/MCB.17.8.4696 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1997 Aug;17(8):4696-706. doi: 10.1128/MCB.17.8.4696.,,,,,PMC232322,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the molecular mechanism of constitutive IL-5 expression in HTLV-1-infected cells remains unclear. To clarify the mechanism of aberrant IL-5 expression in HTLV-1-infected cells, we investigated the response of the human IL-5 promoter to the HTLV-1-encoded protein Tax. Cotransfection experiments using Jurkat cells revealed that Tax is incapable of activating the IL-5 promoter by itself but that it synergistically transactivates the promoter with GATA-binding protein (GATA-4) and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) stimulation. By introducing a series of mutations within the IL-5 promoter, we found that conserved lymphokine element 0 (CLE0) is responsible for mediating the signal induced by Tax-TPA. A deletion construct of the promoter indicated that the -75 GATA element and CLE0 are sufficient to mediate synergistic activation of the IL-5 promoter. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays using Jurkat cell nuclear extracts demonstrated that TPA induces a transcription factor to bind CLE0, and an experiment using JPX-9 cell nuclear extracts showed that Tax enhances this binding activity. An antibody supershift experiment revealed that this band consists of c-Jun and JunD. However, among the Jun family members, only c-Jun is able to cooperate with Tax and GATA-4 to activate the IL-5 promoter. We have determined the minimum factors required for IL-5 gene activation by reconstituting the IL-5 promoter activity in F9 cells. This is the first report to demonstrate the functional involvement of Tax protein in IL-5 gene regulation and to suggest the functional triple synergism among Tax, GATA-4, and AP-1, which disrupts regulated control of the gene and leads to constitutive expression of the IL-5 gene.","['Yamagata, T', 'Mitani, K', 'Ueno, H', 'Kanda, Y', 'Yazaki, Y', 'Hirai, H']","['Yamagata T', 'Mitani K', 'Ueno H', 'Kanda Y', 'Yazaki Y', 'Hirai H']","['Third Department of Internal Medicine, Tokyo University, Bunkyo-ku, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (GATA4 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Interleukin-5)', '0 (Ionophores)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-1)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '37H9VM9WZL (Calcimycin)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Calcimycin/pharmacology', 'Cyclosporine/pharmacology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'GATA4 Transcription Factor', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral/physiology', 'Gene Products, tax/*metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-5/*genetics', 'Ionophores/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*genetics', 'Mutation', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun/metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Transcription Factor AP-1/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation/*physiology', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/08/01 00:00,1997/08/01 00:01,['1997/08/01 00:00'],"['1997/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/MCB.17.8.4272 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1997 Aug;17(8):4272-81. doi: 10.1128/MCB.17.8.4272.,,,,,PMC232280,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

AML1 encodes a nuclear transcription factor (TF) which shows homology in its 5' part with the Drosophila melanogaster segmentation gene, runt, and contains a transactivation domain in the carboxyterminal portion. In the t(8;21), AML1 is fused to the ETO (MTG8) gene, resulting in a hybrid AML1/ETO mRNA, which in turn is translated into a chimeric protein. The objective of this article is to review here the main structural and biological features of AML1 and of its fusion products, with special focus on their clinical correlations and their potential usefulness for prognostic and monitoring studies in human leukemia. EVIDENCE AND INFORMATION SOURCES: The material examined in the present review includes articles and abstracts published in journals covered by the Science Citation Index and Medline. STATE OF ART: The normal AML-1 protein forms the alpha-subunit of the heterodimeric TF core binding factor (or CBF), whose beta-subunit is encoded by the CBF beta gene on chromosome 16q22. CBF beta is rearranged and fused to the MYH11 gene in the AML M4Eo-associated inv(16) aberration. Thus, the two most common chromosome abnormalities of AML, i.e. t(8;21) and inv(16), affect the two subunits of the same target protein. This suggests that the wild type CBF must exert an important role in the control of myeloid cell growth and/or differentiation. Evidence that AML1 is a pivotal regulator of definitive hematopoiesis has been recently provided by analyzing AML1 knockout mice. The chromosome region 21q22, where AML1 maps, is involved in several other karyotypic aberrations, such as the t(3;21) translocation associated with a subset of therapy-related myelodysplastic syndromes and AML, and the blast phase of chronic myelogenous leukemia. In this abnormality, three distinct genes: EVI1, EAP, MDS1, located on chromosome band 3q26, have been identified that may recombine with AML1. Finally, the recently cloned t(12;21) translocation has been found to involve the TEL gene (coding for a novel TF) on 12p13, and AML1 on 21q22. This alteration, which results in the production of a TEL/AML1 chimeric protein, is restricted to pediatric B-lineage acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL), where it represents the most frequent molecular defect known to date (up to 25% of cases). Strikingly, the same t(12;21) is identified in only 0.05% of pediatric B-lineage ALL cases analyzed by conventional karyotyping. Other relevant characteristics of TEL/AML1-positive ALL are frequent deletion of the other TEL allele and association with an excellent prognostic outcome. PERSPECTIVES: It is expected that future studies will provide more detailed information on the leukemogenic effect of AML1 alterations, and better define the prognostic relevance of detecting the hybrid proteins formed by this gene at diagnosis and during remission.","['Lo Coco, F', 'Pisegna, S', 'Diverio, D']","['Lo Coco F', 'Pisegna S', 'Diverio D']","['Department of Human Biopathology, University La Sapienza of Rome, Italy. lococo@dbu.uniroma1.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (AML1-ETO fusion protein, human)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CBFbeta-MYH11 fusion protein)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Runx1 protein, mouse)', '0 (TEL-AML1 fusion protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Child', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 12/genetics/ultrastructure', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21/*genetics/ultrastructure', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 3/genetics/ultrastructure', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8/genetics/ultrastructure', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', '*DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Eosinophilia/genetics', 'Forecasting', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Hematopoiesis/genetics/physiology', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia/etiology/*genetics/pathology/therapy', 'Leukemia, Experimental/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics', '*Oncogenes', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Prognosis', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/physiology', 'Transcription Factors/analysis/genetics/*physiology', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Treatment Outcome']",1997/05/01 00:00,1997/05/01 00:01,['1997/05/01 00:00'],"['1997/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 1997 May-Jun;82(3):364-70.,66,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Four-hundred and seventy unselected, consecutive patients with a diagnosis of B-cell NHL were investigated. Anti-HCV antibodies (Ab) and cryolg were sought in all while HCV RNA and rheumatoid factor were detected on HCV-Ab positive samples. RESULTS: Overall, the prevalence of HCV infection was 8.9% (42/470). It was 95.4% (#21) among the 22 patients with, and 4.6% (#21) among the 448 without production of cryoIg. The most common histotype among the HCV-positive, cryoIg-producing cases, was the immunocytoma (16/21, 76%). Among the HCV-positive, non cryoIg-producing cases, the marginal zone and the follicle center lymphomas were the commonest. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Close association between HCV infection and cryoIg production, already described in mixed cryoglobulinemia, is confirmed also among B-cell NHL. Nevertheless, 50% of HCV-related lymphomas are non-cryoIg producers. Low-grade lymphomas (in particular the immunocytoma) are the most frequent HCV-related lymphomas.

We evaluated its efficacy in patients with diffuse large cell lymphoma (DLCL) by means of a randomized trial comparing two 12-week regimens (VACOP-B and VICOP-B) which differed only in the anthracycline drug used (doxorubicin vs idarubicin). METHODS: From January 1992 to December 1994, 104 patients aged less than 65 years with de novo advanced stage DLCL were enrolled. Fifty-two patients were treated with VACOP-B (doxorubicin 50 mg/sqm) and 52 with VICOP-B (idarubicin initially 8 mg/sqm and thereafter 10 mg/sqm). RESULTS: Clinical characteristics of the two groups were not significantly different. One HBsAg+ patient died of hepatic necrosis in the VICOP-B arm, and severe (WHO grade > 2) toxicities occurred in 7 patients treated with VACOP-B and in 5 treated with VICOP-B; the only significant difference was for mucositis (p = 0.02). Complete remission (CR) was obtained in 79% of patients receiving VACOP-B and in 56% (idarubicin 8 mg/sqm) and 75% (idarubicin 10 mg/sqm) of those in the VICOP-B group (p = n.s.). Prognostic factors that negatively affected CR were advanced stage in VACOP, bone marrow infiltration in both schedules. At a median follow-up of two years, overall survival (67% VACOP and 61% VICOP) and disease-free survival (65% and 67%, respectively) were not significantly different.

Several experimental and clinical findings support a role for autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) in CML. It has been suggested that in the early phase following autografting the Ph-negative clone has a proliferative advantage over the Ph-positive clone. We hypothesized that post-transplant GM-CSF administration could reactivate the functional activity of quiescent normal progenitors and prolong the duration of the post-transplant proliferative advantage of Ph-negative over Ph-positive progenitors. In order to evaluate the effect of post-transplant GM-CSF administration, a pilot clinical study was performed in which CML patients resistant to IFN-alpha therapy were autografted with unmanipulated marrow or blood cells and given prolonged GM-CSF therapy post-transplant. METHODS: Five adult CML patients conditioned with the BAVC regimen were reinfused with either marrow (n = 2) or blood (n = 3) cells and given granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). Recombinant GM-CSF was initially administered at standard dosage (5 micrograms/kg/day) until a white blood cell count > or = 2 x 10(9)/L was achieved on two consecutive examinations, and thereafter at a low dose (1 microgram/kg/day) for 5 to 9 months. On a weekly basis, GM-CSF was discontinued and hydroxyurea (1,000 mg/d) was given for two days. RESULTS: Evidence of trilineage engraftment was observed in all cases. At autografting, 3 out of the 5 patients revealed 8-9% Ph-negative metaphases. During the initial phase of hematopoietic regeneration, direct cytogenetic analysis revealed 81% and 100% Ph-negative metaphases in two cases; nonleukemic hematopoiesis progressively decreased and was no longer detectable at +9 months. One patient showed cyclic Ph-negative hematopoiesis that appeared 3 months following autografting and peaked at +4 and +8 months. The fourth patient showed a low percentage (20%) of Ph-negative metaphases 1 month after ASCT, followed by a significant expansion of nonleukemic hematopoiesis, which could be detected up to month +13. No evidence of Ph-negative hematopoiesis could be detected in one patient. Three patients are in chronic phase 28, 30 and 31 months after autografting, respectively, and two patients evolved into blast crisis. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study demonstrates that combined GM-CSF and hydroxyurea therapy seems to be effective in inducing and/or prolonging a transient period of Ph-negative hematopoiesis. The late appearance of Ph-negative hematopoiesis detected in two patients suggests an antileukemic activity of the combined GM-CSF/hydroxyurea therapy rather than an antileukemic effect of the conditioning regimen.","['Carlo-Stella, C', 'Regazzi, E', 'Andrizzi, C', 'Savoldo, B', 'Garau, D', 'Montefusco, E', 'Vignetti, M', 'Mandelli, F', 'Rizzoli, V', 'Meloni, G']","['Carlo-Stella C', 'Regazzi E', 'Andrizzi C', 'Savoldo B', 'Garau D', 'Montefusco E', 'Vignetti M', 'Mandelli F', 'Rizzoli V', 'Meloni G']","['Dipartimento di Ematologia, Universita di Parma, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '00DPD30SOY (Amsacrine)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'U68WG3173Y (Carmustine)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)', 'BAVC protocol']",IM,"['Adult', 'Amsacrine/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/*therapeutic use', '*Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols', 'Carmustine/administration & dosage', 'Cell Lineage', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Graft Survival/drug effects', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Hematopoiesis/drug effects', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/*therapeutic use', 'Interferon-alpha/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*therapy', 'Male', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Pilot Projects', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Salvage Therapy', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",1997/05/01 00:00,1997/05/01 00:01,['1997/05/01 00:00'],"['1997/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 1997 May-Jun;82(3):291-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A single center study.,286-90,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Recently published studies dealing with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients in early clinical stage reported that bone marrow (BM) biopsies and aspirates can be considered complementary methods of evaluating the extent of BM involvement. Consequently, we designed the present study to investigate the clinical and prognostic implications of BM biopsies and aspirates in a series of stage A CLL patients followed-up in a single center. PATIENTS AND METHODS: BM biopsy sections and aspirate smears obtained at the time of diagnosis from 102 CLL stage A patients were retrospectively evaluated. Results were correlated with clinical and hematological features as well as with survival and disease-progression risk. RESULTS: Diffuse (D) BM histology was detected in 10 patients (9.8%) while 21 (20.5%) displayed lymphocyte infiltration (LI) > 80%. Twenty-six patients (25.4%) died with a 5- and 10-year survival probability of 85% and 50%, respectively. The survival of patients with D-BM histology was significantly shorter than that of patients with non-diffuse (non-D) histology (p < 0.05). Interestingly, when considering only CLL-related deaths (i.e. leukemia progression, infections) were considered, there was an increase in the statistical significance of BM histology (p = 0.01). There was no difference in life expectancy in cases with LI either using different cut-off levels (i.e. 70% and 80%) or excluding non-CLL related deaths. According to our experience, disease progression could only be predicted by BM histology (p = 0.008), while LI was not useful for forecasting progression to more advanced stages (p = NS). INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: In patients with early CLL, BM histology provides more reliable information regarding the clinical outcome of the disease than LI.","['Molica, S', 'Tucci, L', 'Levato, D', 'Docimo, C']","['Molica S', 'Tucci L', 'Levato D', 'Docimo C']","['Divisione Ematologia, Azienda Ospedaliera Pugliese-Ciaccio, Catanzaro, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,,IM,"['Aged', 'Biopsy/*methods', 'Biopsy, Needle', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Bone Marrow Examination/*methods', 'Evaluation Studies as Topic', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/mortality/*pathology', 'Life Tables', 'Lymphocytes/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Analysis', 'Survival Rate']",1997/05/01 00:00,1997/05/01 00:01,['1997/05/01 00:00'],"['1997/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 1997 May-Jun;82(3):286-90.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Infection of neonatal NFSIN mice with a high dose of Cas-Br-M murine leukemia virus, a neuropathogenic type C retrovirus, results in virus-induced neurologic disease and in their failure to generate a protective CTL response. Cas-Br-M-specific CTL are necessary in the protection of neonatal mice from Cas-Br-M-induced neurologic disease. Here we demonstrate that intramuscular inoculation of newborn mice with naked DNA expressing the full length Cas-Br-M genome induces a virus-specific CTL-mediated response. This CTL response is mediated by CD8+ T cells, is long lasting and, when transferred to susceptible neonatal recipients, protects them from Cas-induced neurologic disease. We also provide evidence that the intramuscular inoculation of neonates with plasmid DNA encoding only env sequences induces a dose-dependent CTL response in the absence of an anti-MuLV antibody response.","['Sarzotti, M', 'Dean, T A', 'Remington, M P', 'Ly, C D', 'Furth, P A', 'Robbins, D S']","['Sarzotti M', 'Dean TA', 'Remington MP', 'Ly CD', 'Furth PA', 'Robbins DS']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Maryland at Baltimore 21201, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Vaccine,Vaccine,8406899,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Vaccines, DNA)', '0 (Viral Vaccines)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Antibodies, Viral/biosynthesis', 'DNA, Viral/immunology', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics/*immunology', 'Mice', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology', 'Vaccines, DNA/*immunology', 'Viral Vaccines/*immunology']",1997/06/01 00:00,1997/06/01 00:01,['1997/06/01 00:00'],"['1997/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0264-410X(96)00250-2 [pii]', '10.1016/s0264-410x(96)00250-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Vaccine. 1997 Jun;15(8):795-7. doi: 10.1016/s0264-410x(96)00250-2.,,,['CA65388/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The estimated true herd status was based on the sensitivity and specificity of the AGID test and the number of cattle sampled per herd. Ninety-seven herds were used, with a mean of 13 cows sampled per herd. The AGID test indicated an apparent herd prevalence of 70.1%. After accounting for the number of cows sampled and the sensitivity and specificity of the AGID test, the estimated true herd prevalence of BLV was 52.3%. The ELISA test identified 79.4% of herds as positive for BLV, and had an apparent sensitivity and specificity of 0.97 and 0.62, respectively. However, after accounting for the sensitivity and specificity of the AGID test in individual animals, the specificity of the ELISA test was 0.44. The ELISA test was useful for identifying BLV-negative herds (i.e., ruling out the presence of BLV infection in test negative herds). With the moderately low specificity, herds identified as positive by the ELISA test would require further testing at the individual or herd level to definitively establish their BLV status.","['Sargeant, J M', 'Kelton, D F', 'Martin, S W', 'Mann, E D']","['Sargeant JM', 'Kelton DF', 'Martin SW', 'Mann ED']","['Department of Population Medicine, University of Guelph, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Prev Vet Med,Preventive veterinary medicine,8217463,"['0 (Antigens, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Viral/analysis', 'Cattle', 'Enzootic Bovine Leukosis/*diagnosis/epidemiology', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay/methods/*veterinary', 'Female', 'Immunodiffusion/methods/veterinary', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/immunology/*isolation & purification', 'Milk/*virology', 'Models, Biological', 'Ontario/epidemiology', 'Prevalence', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",1997/08/01 00:00,1997/08/01 00:01,['1997/08/01 00:00'],"['1997/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0167-5877(96)01139-7 [pii]', '10.1016/s0167-5877(96)01139-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Prev Vet Med. 1997 Aug;31(3-4):223-30. doi: 10.1016/s0167-5877(96)01139-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The endocytic process involves the mechanical deformation of the membrane to produce an invagination. Studies of osmotic swelling effects on endocytosis indicate that the increased surface tension is tightly correlated to a significant decrease of endocytosis. When rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) cells are stimulated to secrete, there is a dramatic drop in the membrane tension and only small changes in membrane bending stiffness. Neither the shape change that normally accompanies secretion nor the binding of ligand without secretion causes a drop in tension. Further, tension decreases within 6 s, preceding shape change and measurable changes in endocytosis. After secretion stops, tension recovers. On the basis of these results we suggest that the physical parameter of membrane tension is a major regulator of endocytic rate in RBL cells. Low tensions would stimulate endocytosis and high tensions would stall the endocytic machinery.","['Dai, J', 'Ting-Beall, H P', 'Sheetz, M P']","['Dai J', 'Ting-Beall HP', 'Sheetz MP']","['Department of Cell Biology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina 27710, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Gen Physiol,The Journal of general physiology,2985110R,"['0 (Dinitrophenols)', '0 (dinitrophenyl-bovine serum albumin)', '27432CM55Q (Serum Albumin, Bovine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Body Water/metabolism', 'Cell Membrane/physiology', 'Dinitrophenols/pharmacology', '*Endocytosis', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/metabolism/pathology/*physiopathology', 'Osmosis', 'Rats', 'Serum Albumin, Bovine/pharmacology', 'Surface Tension', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/07/01 00:00,1997/07/01 00:01,['1997/07/01 00:00'],"['1997/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1085/jgp.110.1.1 [doi]'],ppublish,J Gen Physiol. 1997 Jul;110(1):1-10. doi: 10.1085/jgp.110.1.1.,,,,,PMC2229359,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our results suggest that leukemia cells of different lineages have distinct constitutive endonucleases, which may play a role in the occurrence of apoptosis in these cells.","['Kataoka, A', 'Kubota, M', 'Usami, I', 'Okuda, A', 'Lin, Y W', 'Koishi, S', 'Sawada, M', 'Akiyama, Y', 'Furusho, K']","['Kataoka A', 'Kubota M', 'Usami I', 'Okuda A', 'Lin YW', 'Koishi S', 'Sawada M', 'Akiyama Y', 'Furusho K']","['Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Kyoto University, Sakyo, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Ireland,Cancer Lett,Cancer letters,7600053,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Nucleosomes)', 'EC 3.1.- (Endodeoxyribonucleases)', 'J41CSQ7QDS (Zinc)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', '*DNA Fragmentation', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*metabolism', 'Endodeoxyribonucleases/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/enzymology/*genetics', 'Nucleosomes/metabolism', 'Zinc/pharmacology']",1997/07/15 00:00,1997/07/15 00:01,['1997/07/15 00:00'],"['1997/07/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/07/15 00:01 [medline]', '1997/07/15 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0304-3835(97)00198-5 [pii]', '10.1016/s0304-3835(97)00198-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Lett. 1997 Jul 15;117(1):29-34. doi: 10.1016/s0304-3835(97)00198-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To learn more about p53's transactivator function in vivo, we performed genomic footprinting experiments examining p53-DNA interactions in the regulatory regions of the p53-regulated genes p21, GADD45, and MDM2. Using ionizing radiation to induce DNA damage in human ML-1 myeloblastic leukemia cells, the promoter and intronic regions of these genes containing p53-consensus binding sites were examined for in vivo footprints. There was a uniform and sustained expression of p53 protein as well as a strong induction of p21, GADD45, and MDM2 mRNA following irradiation. At the two p53 consensus binding sites in the p21 promoter, reduced DNaseI cleavage was observed in irradiated cells beginning 1 to 2h after irradiation, being most pronounced after 2 h and diminishing after 8 h. A partial in vivo footprint was also observed in the third intron of the GADD45 gene beginning 2 h after irradiation. No in vivo footprints were seen at the two p53 binding sites in the MDM2 gene. Our study provides direct evidence that the DNA damage-induced activity of p53 is mediated by its consensus DNA binding sites in the p21 and GADD45 genes. We suggest that the transient nature and relative instability of p53-DNA interactions in vivo may make the p53 protein more accessible to a rapid turnover pathway which might be impaired under conditions when the protein is stably bound to DNA.","['Chin, P L', 'Momand, J', 'Pfeifer, G P']","['Chin PL', 'Momand J', 'Pfeifer GP']","['City of Hope National Medical Center, Department of Biology, Duarte, California 91010, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (GADD45 protein)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (MDM2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (HRAS protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras))']",IM,"['Binding Sites', '*Consensus Sequence', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Footprinting', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Proteins/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras)/*radiation effects', 'Radiation, Ionizing', 'Time Factors', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism/*radiation effects']",1997/07/03 00:00,1997/07/03 00:01,['1997/07/03 00:00'],"['1997/07/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/07/03 00:01 [medline]', '1997/07/03 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1201161 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 1997 Jul 3;15(1):87-99. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1201161.,,,['ES06070/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we isolated the human PEBP2alphaA cDNA by which we mapped the gene to 6p12.3-p21.1. Human chromosome 6p21 is the locus for cleidocranial dysplasia, an autosomal dominant bone disease.

The Abs have been used successfully in primate models of allograft rejection, graft-vs-host disease, and autoimmunity. We produced bifunctional humanized anti-IL-2R alpha beta Abs (BF-IgG) to combine the specificity of the two Abs into one entity by fusing HAT-producing NSO cells and HuMik beta 1-producing Sp2/0 cells. BF-IgG was purified using protein G-Sepharose affinity chromatography, followed by IL-2R alpha and IL-2R beta affinity chromatography and hydrophobic interaction chromatography. BF-IgG exhibited both anti-IL-2R alpha and anti-IL-2R beta specificities in binding assays. While the Ab binds the IL-2R with intermediate affinity (Kd = 2.82 nM), it does not inhibit IL-15 binding to its high affinity IL-15R. In Kit225/K6 (IL-2R alpha beta gamma+) cells, BF-IgG was 10-fold more potent than a HAT/HuMik beta 1 equimolar mixture in blocking IL-2-induced proliferation and, unexpectedly, was at least 65-fold more active than the mixture in blocking IL-15-induced proliferation. This dual inhibitory activity may be due to cross-linking of the IL-2R alpha and IL-2R beta, thus blocking IL-2 binding and possibly impeding the association of IL-2R beta with IL-15R. BF-IgG has potent immunosuppressant activities against both IL-2- and IL-15-mediated responses, and this antagonist could be more efficacious than HAT and/or HuMik beta 1 for the treatment of autoimmunity and the prevention of allograft rejection.","['Pilson, R S', 'Levin, W', 'Desai, B', 'Reik, L M', 'Lin, P', 'Korkmaz-Duffy, E', 'Campbell, E', 'Tso, J Y', 'Kerwin, J A', 'Hakimi, J']","['Pilson RS', 'Levin W', 'Desai B', 'Reik LM', 'Lin P', 'Korkmaz-Duffy E', 'Campbell E', 'Tso JY', 'Kerwin JA', 'Hakimi J']","['Roche Research Center, Inflammation and Autoimmune Diseases, Hoffmann-La Roche, Inc., Nutley, NJ 07110, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antibodies, Bispecific)', '0 (Antibodies, Blocking)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-15)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '368GB5141J (Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Bispecific/biosynthesis/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Antibodies, Blocking/pharmacology', 'Antibody Affinity', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Binding Sites, Antibody', 'Cell Division/immunology', 'Clone Cells', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Growth Inhibitors/*immunology/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Hybrid Cells', 'Interleukin-15/*physiology', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/immunology/metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/*immunology/*physiology', 'Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/08/01 00:00,1997/08/01 00:01,['1997/08/01 00:00'],"['1997/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1997 Aug 1;159(3):1543-56.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Alpha 4 beta 7-mediated adhesion to mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule-1 (MAdCAM-1) directs lymphocyte homing to the gut, and alpha E beta 7 mediates binding of lymphocytes to E-cadherin on epithelial cells. Since alpha 4 beta 7 mediates adhesion to MAdCAM-1 but alpha 4 beta 1 does not, we used beta 7/beta 1 chimeras to directly assess the importance of specific regions of beta 7 in MAdCAM-1 binding. We found a region of beta 7 (residues 46-386) that accounts for specificity of alpha 4 beta 7 binding to MAdCAM-1. We also used human/mouse and human/rat chimeric beta 7 subunits to map epitopes recognized by fifteen anti-beta 7 mAbs. Six of seven Abs that block adhesion to MAdCAM-1 and E-cadherin (Fib 21, 22, 27, 30, 504; Act-1) mapped to amino acid residues 176-250. Residues 176-250 lie within the region of beta 7 that specifies MAdCAM-1 binding and also within a region that has a predicted structure homologous to the metal ion-dependent adhesion site (MIDAS) domains of the integrin subunits alpha L and alpha M. Three new Abs that recognize beta 7 in the presence of Mn2+, but not Ca2+, and promote adhesion to MAdCAM-1, mapped to amino acids 46-149.

One mechanism known to mediate T cell apoptosis is the CD95 (Fas/APO-1) Ag apoptotic pathway. CD95 is a cell surface protein that is expressed on activated T cells and is capable of relaying an intracellular apoptotic signal upon binding with CD95 ligand. CD95-dependent apoptosis has been shown to be involved in the homeostatic control of peripheral T cell numbers; however, the functional significance of the CD95 apoptotic pathway in the context of viral infections has not been clearly elucidated. We show that exposure to a variety of viral pathogens causes enhanced CD95 expression in naive peripheral blood cell T lymphocytes without leading to enhanced susceptibility to CD95-dependent apoptosis. Productive viral infection was not required for this effect. Furthermore, using a T cell line and the K562 tumor cell line, we demonstrate that cells normally resistant to CD95-mediated killing become susceptible when productively infected with virus in a manner that does not rely on increased CD95 surface expression. These findings demonstrate a regulatory influence of viral infection on CD95 expression and activity and suggest that in addition to having a role in T cell homeostasis, the CD95 apoptotic pathway might also function to eliminate virus-infected T cells.","['Sieg, S', 'Huang, Y', 'Kaplan, D']","['Sieg S', 'Huang Y', 'Kaplan D']","['Department of Pathology, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH 44106, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (fas Receptor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Apoptosis/*immunology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Herpesvirus 1, Human/physiology', 'Herpesvirus 2, Human/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Parainfluenza Virus 3, Human/physiology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/enzymology/immunology/*virology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', '*Virus Physiological Phenomena', 'fas Receptor/*biosynthesis']",1997/08/01 00:00,1997/08/01 00:01,['1997/08/01 00:00'],"['1997/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1997 Aug 1;159(3):1192-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to study the proteins encoded by ETV6 and ETV6-AML1, we raised polyclonal antibodies directed against a recombinant peptide corresponding to the junctional region of ETV6-AML1. Cell lysates from various leukaemic cell lines, and from children with B- and T-lineage ALLs, were studied by Western blot. Two isoforms of ETV6 protein were detected in normal bone marrow cells and in leukaemic cells without 12p alteration: a major form (apparent m.w. 63 kD) and a minor one (apparent m.w. 53 kD). In the REH cell line, which expresses the ETV6-AML1 fusion transcript and no normal ETV6 mRNA, the ETV6 isoforms were absent and two new bands were detected corresponding to ETV6-AML1 protein products (apparent m.w. 95 and 105 kD). A similar pattern was obtained with blast cells from patients with a t(12;21) and a deletion of ETV6. In two patients with a t(12;21) but no deletion of ETV6, four bands were detected corresponding to both the normal ETV6 and ETV6-AML1 proteins, suggesting that in these cases the second ETV6 allele was not inactivated. Surprisingly, the expression pattern of ETV6 differed widely from patient to patient. In three out of 13 patients without t(12;21), the relative intensity of the bands corresponding to ETV6 isoforms in blast cells from patients was completely different from normal cells, with a marked predominance of the 53 kD isoform.

Patients with a positive BAL or viraemia received a 14 d course of ganciclovir or foscarnet. CMV was detected in 29 (46%) of the 63 BMT recipients and excretion of CMV in blood and BAL was significantly linked. However, among the 29 patients who excreted the virus, only 10 (35%) shed CMV in blood and BAL at the same time: 19 patients (65%) had detectable CMV in blood (11 patients) or BAL (eight patients) only. Therefore, on the basis of viraemia or BAL alone, 21/29 patients (70%) and 18/29 patients (60%), respectively, would have received antiviral treatment.

Phage inserts were assembled into four contigs with 21 exons, and an intron phase map was produced enabling the interpretation of translocation-generated fusion proteins. The gene contains two alternative first exons, 1a and 1b, both including a translation initiation codon. The translocation breakpoint cluster region is flanked by exons 3 and 6 and two different polyadenylation signals were identified. Polyclonal antisera directed against three different portions of the AF-4 protein were produced and used to detect a 116 kD protein in cellular extracts of human B-lymphoblastoid and proB cell lines. In mitogen-stimulated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells the AF-4 antigen was predominantly located in the nucleus. The AF-4 gene is a member of the AF-4, LAF-4 and FMR-2 gene family.

The CD8 molecule is composed of alpha and beta chains and commonly used monoclonal antibodies against CD8 molecule detect only CD8alpha. Since it has been reported that CD8alpha can be induced in mature CD4+ T cells by cell activation, but not CD8beta, we studied whether ATL cells which express CD8alpha may also express CD8beta. We found some cases of CD8alpha+ ATL were also positive for CD8beta. Furthermore, we experienced a case whose ATL cell surface phenotype changed from CD4+ CD8alpha+ CD8beta+ to CD4- CD8alpha+ CD8beta+ and finally to CD4+ CD8alpha- CD8beta-. Southern blot analysis revealed that the monoclonal integration of human T lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I) was identical throughout the course of the study, indicating that a single clone had demonstrated the alterations. These data suggest that peripheral CD4+ CD8+ ATL cells can express not only CD8alpha, but also CD8beta and that a single ATL cell clone has the potential to change its surface phenotype in vivo as well as in vitro.","['Joh, T', 'Yamada, Y', 'Seto, M', 'Kamihira, S', 'Tomonaga, M']","['Joh T', 'Yamada Y', 'Seto M', 'Kamihira S', 'Tomonaga M']","['Laboratory of Chemotherapy, Aichi Cancer Centre Research Institute, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (CD4 Antigens)', '0 (CD8 Antigens)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Blotting, Southern', 'CD4 Antigens/*metabolism', 'CD8 Antigens/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*immunology', 'Phenotype', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/07/01 00:00,1997/07/01 00:01,['1997/07/01 00:00'],"['1997/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-2141.1997.1853002.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1997 Jul;98(1):151-6. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1997.1853002.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Allelic loss of these chromosomal regions could be detected in 24% (6q), 15% (12p) and 10% (13q) of the patients respectively, whereas aberrations involving 9p were detected in approximately 50% of the cases. There was an inverse correlation between loss of heterozygosity (LOH) for chromosome 12 and inactivation of the p16ink4 gene.

PCR follow-up was performed in children in morphological and cytogenetic complete remission, provided an immunoglobulin (IgH) gene rearrangement could be detected using FR 3/J(H) amplimers. MRD was studied according to our previously described methodology, with a few modifications including the use of a consensus J(H) probe to control for PCR efficiency variations. Out of the initial 51 patients, 34 were assessable for MRD at the end of induction at the time of analysis. MRD levels were as follows: > 1/10(3) in 26%, 1/10(3) to 1/10(4) in 50% and < 1/10(4) or not detectable in 24%. With a median follow-up of 20 months there were five relapses, all of which occurred in the group of patients with MRD > 1/10(3). To date, none of the patients with MRD < or = 1/10(3) (good molecular responder) has relapsed. Classification according to molecular response at the end of induction did not correlate with the conventional risks groups: there were no statistically significant differences between good and bad molecular responders. Of particular interest is the absence of correlation between WBC at diagnosis and MRD level at the end of induction. We conclude that classification of patients into good and bad molecular responders using PCR seems to be a better prognostic indicator than conventional risk factors in childhood B-lineage ALL. Patients with MRD level > 1/10(3) have a particularly poor outcome and should always be considered for alternative therapeutic strategies in the future, whereas in good molecular responders belonging to poor or intermediate risk categories, treatment de-escalation might be contemplated.","['Jacquy, C', 'Delepaut, B', 'Van Daele, S', 'Vaerman, J L', 'Zenebergh, A', 'Brichard, B', 'Vermylen, C', 'Cornu, G', 'Martiat, P']","['Jacquy C', 'Delepaut B', 'Van Daele S', 'Vaerman JL', 'Zenebergh A', 'Brichard B', 'Vermylen C', 'Cornu G', 'Martiat P']","['Haematologic Molecular Biology Unit, University of Louvain Medical School, Brussels, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/drug therapy/radiotherapy/*therapy', 'Male', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Ploidies', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/radiotherapy/*therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Analysis']",1997/07/01 00:00,1997/07/01 00:01,['1997/07/01 00:00'],"['1997/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-2141.1997.1792996.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1997 Jul;98(1):140-6. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1997.1792996.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To investigate the possible presence of microsatellite instability in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), we examined 48 primary ALL samples. Instability was determined at 85 different microsatellite loci localized to 12 different chromosome arms. Microsatellite instability was detected in five (10%) samples. Interestingly, the instability was found at chromosomal regions associated with frequent alterations. Two samples had instability at the microsatellite marker within the TEL gene on chromosome arm 12p. Two other samples had instability at a microsatellite marker close to CDKN2/p16 on 9p; one of these samples had a homozygous deletion at 9p21. The fifth sample had instability at the microsatellite marker on 6q, which we have found is a frequent region of loss of heterozygosity in childhood ALL. Taken together, instability was rare in childhood ALL, but was localized to the three most frequently deleted chromosome regions in childhood ALL, suggesting that localized microsatellite instability may identify a fragile chromosomal region which could result in alteration of surrounding target genes and lead to leukaemia.","['Takeuchi, S', 'Seriu, T', 'Tasaka, T', 'Koike, M', 'Cho, S K', 'Park, S', 'Slater, J', 'Mufti, I', 'Hatta, Y', 'Miyoshi, I', 'Bartram, C R', 'Koeffler, H P']","['Takeuchi S', 'Seriu T', 'Tasaka T', 'Koike M', 'Cho SK', 'Park S', 'Slater J', 'Mufti I', 'Hatta Y', 'Miyoshi I', 'Bartram CR', 'Koeffler HP']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Cedars-Sinai Research Institute, UCLA School of Medicine, Los Angeles, California, U.S.A.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (ETS translocation variant 6 protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Blotting, Southern', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Heterozygote', 'Homozygote', 'Humans', 'Male', '*Microsatellite Repeats', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets', '*Repressor Proteins', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics']",1997/07/01 00:00,1997/07/01 00:01,['1997/07/01 00:00'],"['1997/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-2141.1997.1662981.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1997 Jul;98(1):134-9. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1997.1662981.x.,,,"['CA 43277/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA26038/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK 42792/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Three hundred thirty-nine men with metastatic NSGCT were treated with POMB/ACE (cisplatin, vincristine, methotrexate, bleomycin, actinomycin D, cyclophosphamide and etoposide), including 42 who had received previous chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Previously untreated patients were classified according to the International Germ Cell Cancer Collaborative Group (IGCCCG) model, and 31% were in the worst prognostic group. RESULTS: The median follow-up is eight years. The overall survival at five years is 82% (95% confidence interval (CI); 78%-85%). The survival of untreated patients exceeded that for previously treated patients (log-rank P = 0.04) and of testicular tumours exceeded that for primary extragonadal tumours (log-rank P < 0.0001). The survival of men with IGCCCG poor prognosis disease at three years is 75% (95% CI: 65%-84%) compared to 50% in the large cohort which was used to derive the model. There were five early treatment related deaths. In addition, five patients developed acute leukaemia, one developed a second primary lung adenocarcinoma, one man died of pulmonary fibrosis and three men died of cerebrovascular or cardiovascular disease. CONCLUSIONS: The POMB/ACE schedule has been employed in a large series of men with metastatic NSGCT over two decades. The fatal toxicity is equivalent to that described for simpler regimens. It yields equivalent response rates and survival in men with good prognosis disease and appears to achieve better survival in patients with poor prognosis disease.","['Bower, M', 'Newlands, E S', 'Holden, L', 'Rustin, G J', 'Begent, R H']","['Bower M', 'Newlands ES', 'Holden L', 'Rustin GJ', 'Begent RH']","['Medical Oncology Unit, Charing Cross Hospital, London, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Ann Oncol,Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology,9007735,"['11056-06-7 (Bleomycin)', '1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)', 'POMB-ACE regimen']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Bleomycin/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Cisplatin/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Dactinomycin/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Germinoma/*drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Survival Rate', 'Testicular Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage/adverse effects']",1997/05/01 00:00,1997/05/01 00:01,['1997/05/01 00:00'],"['1997/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1023/a:1008279222625 [doi]', 'S0923-7534(19)48250-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Oncol. 1997 May;8(5):477-83. doi: 10.1023/a:1008279222625.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective study. ANIMALS OR SAMPLE POPULATION: 45 client-owned cats. METHODS: Medical records of cats with soft tissue FSA were examined. Vaccination and feline leukemia virus (FeLV) status, age, sex, breed, tumor location, number of surgeries, completeness of excision, and histopathological grade were evaluated to correlate with tumor-free interval and survival periods. RESULTS: Overall median tumor-free interval and survival times were 10 and 11.5 (range, 1 to 40) months. Median tumor-free interval and survival times were more than 16 months each in group 1, more than 5 and 13 months in group 2, and 4.5 and 9 months in group 3. Age, sex, breed, vaccination or FeLV status, tumor location, or histopathological grade did not affect median tumor-free interval or survival times (P > .05). Cats with complete excisions had significantly longer median tumor-free interval (> 16 versus 4 months) and survival time (> 16 versus 9 months) than those with incomplete excisions (P = .008). Radiation therapy did not seem to extend tumor-free interval and survival times (P = .013). However, most group 3 cats had incomplete surgical excisions, resulting in recurrent or progressive disease. CONCLUSIONS: Complete surgical excision of FSA in cats is possible and can be curative. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Aggressive surgical excision with wide margins appears to contribute to extended tumor-free interval and survival times in cats with soft tissue FSA. Controlled prospective studies are needed to determine the efficacy of RTH in treatment.","['Davidson, E B', 'Gregory, C R', 'Kass, P H']","['Davidson EB', 'Gregory CR', 'Kass PH']","['Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital, Department of Surgical and Radiological Sciences, University of California, Davis 95616-8745, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Vet Surg,Veterinary surgery : VS,8113214,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cat Diseases/mortality/*surgery', 'Cats/*surgery', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Fibrosarcoma/mortality/surgery/*veterinary', 'Male', 'Radiotherapy, Adjuvant/veterinary', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Soft Tissue Neoplasms/mortality/surgery/*veterinary', 'Treatment Outcome']",1997/07/01 00:00,1997/07/01 00:01,['1997/07/01 00:00'],"['1997/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0161349997000343 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1532-950x.1997.tb01497.x [doi]']",ppublish,Vet Surg. 1997 Jul-Aug;26(4):265-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1532-950x.1997.tb01497.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The multidrug resistant (MDR) phenotype has been suspected as a major mechanism of therapy failure in AML; it is one of the best understood mechanisms of resistance to anticancer drugs. The classical MDR phenotype is characterized by the reduced ability of cells to accumulate drugs as compared to normal cells. The increased drug efflux is due to the activity of a 170 kDa glycoprotein, the P-glycoprotein (Pgp), a unidirectional drug-efflux pump which is encoded by the MDR1 gene. While studies of myeloid leukaemia and myeloma have provided the best evidence for the potential association between Pgp expression and clinical outcome, the lack of standardized methods for MDR detection and perhaps even more importantly, inconsistencies in the interpretation of MDR expression data account for divergent results in the literature. The clinicians' strong interest in MDR stems from the availability of agents capable of interfering with MDR, at least in vitro. If these laboratory results were reproducible in vivo, reversal of MDR would offer a rare opportunity to incorporate laboratory experience into the clinical management of patients.","['Paietta, E']",['Paietta E'],"['Department of Oncology, Montefiore and Albert Einstein Cancer Center, Bronx, NY, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Med Oncol,"Medical oncology (Northwood, London, England)",9435512,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Genes, MDR/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Phenotype']",1997/03/01 00:00,1997/03/01 00:01,['1997/03/01 00:00'],"['1997/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF02990947 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Oncol. 1997 Mar;14(1):53-60. doi: 10.1007/BF02990947.,63,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, with improved tissue typing using DNA techniques, immunosuppression using T-cell depletion in vitro or in vivo, the frequency of acute GVHD is acceptable and the results approach those obtained with HLA-identical siblings. For patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia, the worldwide 3-year survival is around 40%. Other indications for bone marrow transplantation with unrelated marrow include acute leukaemia and myelodysplastic syndromes with high-risk features. Unrelated cord blood cells and unrelated peripheral blood progenitor cells will be increasingly used as alternative haematopoietic stem cell sources to bone marrow.

We present the case reports of two children (MDS and AML) with rapidly increasing MC in whom withdrawal of post-transplant immunosuppression or donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) did prevent relapse.","['Bader, P', 'Beck, J', 'Schlegel, P G', 'Handgretinger, R', 'Niethammer, D', 'Klingebiel, T']","['Bader P', 'Beck J', 'Schlegel PG', 'Handgretinger R', 'Niethammer D', 'Klingebiel T']","[""University Children's Hospital, Department of Hematology/Oncology, Tuebingen, Germany.""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,,IM,"['Acute Disease', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child, Preschool', 'Humans', '*Immunotherapy', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Male', 'Recurrence', 'Transplantation Chimera/*immunology', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1997/07/01 00:00,1997/07/01 00:01,['1997/07/01 00:00'],"['1997/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.bmt.1700831 [doi]'],ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1997 Jul;20(1):79-81. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1700831.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Impact of HLA class II matching. Chronic Leukemia Working Party of the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.,11-9,"We have retrospectively analyzed the impact of prognostic factors on the outcome of serologically HLA-matched unrelated donor (UD) BMT for CML. For this purpose, we have studied a cohort of 366 patients transplanted in Europe between January 1985 and December 1994. The median age of the 211 males and 155 females was 34 years; 238 patients were transplanted in first chronic phase and 116 in advanced phases. The median interval from diagnosis to BMT was 827 days. GVHD prophylaxis consisted of CsA and MTX in 202 patients or of ex vivo or in vivo T cell depletion (TCD) in 129. Recently, DNA-based methods of HLA-class II typing have been used to improve donor selection. We obtained complete data on 300 donor/recipient (D/R) pairs. Among them, we have identified three groups of patients, according to specific HLA-DRB1 D/R compatibility. Two hundred and ten patients received marrow from donors identical for HLA-DRB1 (group 1). Thirty-one patients received BMT from a donor who was HLA-DRB1 mismatched (group 2) and 59 from a donor in whom specific HLA-DRB1 typing was not performed (group 3). The overall survival was 37 +/- 3% at 2 years and leukemia-free survival (LFS) was 31 +/- 3%. In univariate analysis, five variables had a favorable effect on LFS: transplant in first chronic phase (P = 0.0001), time interval from diagnosis to BMT shorter than the median (P = 0.01), prophylaxis of GVHD without TCD (P + 0.001), acute GVHD < grade III (P = 0.0009) and HLA-DRB1 D/R matching (P = 0.0001). Transplant-related mortality (TRM) was 49 +/- 4% in group 1, 79 +/- 8% in group 2 and 80 +/- 6% in group 3 (P = 0.0001). Multivariate analysis confirmed that HLA-DRB1 matching was the most significant factor influencing survival (P = 0.04), LFS (P = 0.013) and TRM (P = 0.0049). From these results, we have defined a 'good risk' group, ie patients transplanted in first chronic phase, from an HLA-DRB1 matched donor, without TCD as prophylaxis against GVHD. The 2 year LFS, TRM and relapse incidence for this group were 51 +/- 5%, 47 +/- 5% and 2 +/- 2%, respectively. This suggests that the long-term outcome of patients with favorable prognostic features can approach that of patients transplanted from geno-identical siblings. In contrast, the TRM for patients transplanted for advanced disease from non HLA-DRB1-identical donors was 94%. Such a high TRM clearly indicates that UD BMT is not justifiable for these individuals.","['Devergie, A', 'Apperley, J F', 'Labopin, M', 'Madrigal, A', 'Jacobsen, N', 'Carreras, E', 'Prentice, H G', 'Jouet, J P', 'Kolb, H J', 'Herstenstein, B', 'Bacigalupo, A', 'Evensen, S A', 'Ljungman, P', 'de Witte, T', 'Reiffers, J', 'Nagler, A', 'Clark, R E', 'Goldman, J M', 'Gratwohl, A']","['Devergie A', 'Apperley JF', 'Labopin M', 'Madrigal A', 'Jacobsen N', 'Carreras E', 'Prentice HG', 'Jouet JP', 'Kolb HJ', 'Herstenstein B', 'Bacigalupo A', 'Evensen SA', 'Ljungman P', 'de Witte T', 'Reiffers J', 'Nagler A', 'Clark RE', 'Goldman JM', 'Gratwohl A']","['Hopital Saint Louis, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,['0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Bone Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II/*immunology', '*Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/immunology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Tissue Donors', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",1997/07/01 00:00,1997/07/01 00:01,['1997/07/01 00:00'],"['1997/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.bmt.1700844 [doi]'],ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1997 Jul;20(1):11-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1700844.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the rate of bone marrow relapse after transplant for either of these diseases remains high. In this study, we assessed the efficacy and toxicity of high-dose cytosine arabinoside and total body irradiation (TBI) followed by allogeneic BMT, for children with acute leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Sixty-five pediatric patients underwent allogeneic related (n = 57) or unrelated (n = 8) BMT. Twenty-seven were transplanted for ALL in second remission (CR2), and 16 for AML in first remission (CR1). The other 22 were high risk patients: six were transplanted for ALL in third remission (CR3), two for AML in CR2, two for myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and 12 for acute leukemia in relapse. Patients were prepared with cytosine arabinoside 3000 mg/m2 per dose twice daily for 6 days followed by 12000 cGy TBI as 200 cGy fractions twice daily for 3 days. Minimum follow-up is 21 months. Five-year event-free survival (EFS) and the actuarial relapse rate is 59 and 14% for patients with ALL in second remission, and 38 and 14+% for patients with AML in first remission. Twelve patients have relapsed (three are alive in remission after testicular or marrow relapse) and 28 have died of other causes. Acute GVHD with or without infection was the cause of death in 11 patients. Ten of the 11 patients who died of acute GVHD were considered at 'high risk' for GVHD (inadequate GVHD prophylaxis, or mismatched family donor or a matched unrelated donor). Toxicities in the immediate post-BMT period included diarrhea, oropharyngeal mucositis and conjunctivitis. Significant late toxicities included short stature, avascular necrosis of bone, and poor school performance (most often in patients who had received prior cranial irradiation). Our conclusions are that high-dose Ara-C and TBI followed by allogeneic bone marrow transplantation is effective therapy for children in second complete remission of their acute leukemia. However, significant late toxicities occur, and it is clear that more effective, less toxic therapies are necessary for these patients.","['Gordon, B G', 'Warkentin, P I', 'Strandjord, S E', 'Abromowitch, M', 'Bayever, E', 'Harper, J L', 'Coccia, P F']","['Gordon BG', 'Warkentin PI', 'Strandjord SE', 'Abromowitch M', 'Bayever E', 'Harper JL', 'Coccia PF']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha 68198-2168, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Graft Survival', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*therapy', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",1997/07/01 00:00,1997/07/01 00:01,['1997/07/01 00:00'],"['1997/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.bmt.1700827 [doi]'],ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1997 Jul;20(1):5-10. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1700827.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, increased cytotoxicity is not always correlated with an increased level of intracellular drug. Although we have previously shown that PACA nanoparticles are not endocytosed by tumour cells, we report here that a direct interaction between nanoparticles and cells is a necessary requirement for overcoming resistance. In addition, the results showed that the degradation products of PACA (mainly polycyanoacrylic acid) in the presence of doxorubicin are able to increase both accumulation and cytotoxicity, thus suggesting the formation of a doxorubicin-polycyanoacrylic acid ion pair. It is therefore concluded that resistance is overcome as a result of both the adsorption of nanoparticles to the cell surface and increased doxorubicin diffusion by the accumulation of an ion pair at the plasma membrane.","['de Verdiere, A C', 'Dubernet, C', 'Nemati, F', 'Soma, E', 'Appel, M', 'Ferte, J', 'Bernard, S', 'Puisieux, F', 'Couvreur, P']","['de Verdiere AC', 'Dubernet C', 'Nemati F', 'Soma E', 'Appel M', 'Ferte J', 'Bernard S', 'Puisieux F', 'Couvreur P']","[""Centre d'Etudes Pharmaceutiques, URA CNRS 1218, Chatenay-Malabry.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Cyanoacrylates)', '0 (Drug Carriers)', '0 (Polymers)', '107811-81-4 (polyisohexylcyanoacrylate)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'F8CEP82QNP (Enbucrilate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*metabolism', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cyanoacrylates/*pharmacology', 'Doxorubicin/*metabolism', 'Drug Carriers', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Enbucrilate', 'Leukemia P388/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Microspheres', 'Polymers/*pharmacology', 'Spectrum Analysis, Raman', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1997/01/01 00:00,1997/01/01 00:01,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/bjc.1997.362 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1997;76(2):198-205. doi: 10.1038/bjc.1997.362.,,,,,PMC2223924,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, it has been reported that acquired resistance to all-trans retinoic acid (RA) in leukaemia is associated with decreased plasma peak levels, probably the result of enhanced retinoid metabolism. The aim of this study was to investigate the metabolism of retinoids and relate this to growth inhibition in HNSCC. Three HNSCC cell lines were selected on the basis of a large variation in the all-trans RA-induced growth inhibition. Cells were exposed to 9.5 nM (radioactive) for 4 and 24 h, and to 1 and 10 microM (nonradioactive) all-trans RA for 4, 24, 48 and 72 h, and medium and cells were analysed for retinoid metabolites. At all concentrations studied, the amount of growth inhibition was proportional to the extent at which all-trans-, 13- and 9-cis RA disappeared from the medium as well as from the cells. This turnover process coincided with the formation of a group of as yet unidentified polar retinoid metabolites. The level of mRNA of cellular RA-binding protein II (CRABP-II), involved in retinoid homeostasis, was inversely proportional to growth inhibition. These findings indicate that for HNSCC retinoid metabolism may be associated with growth inhibition.","['Braakhuis, B J', 'Klaassen, I', 'van der Leede, B M', 'Cloos, J', 'Brakenhoff, R H', 'Copper, M P', 'Teerlink, T', 'Hendriks, H F', 'van der Saag, P T', 'Snow, G B']","['Braakhuis BJ', 'Klaassen I', 'van der Leede BM', 'Cloos J', 'Brakenhoff RH', 'Copper MP', 'Teerlink T', 'Hendriks HF', 'van der Saag PT', 'Snow GB']","['Department of Otolaryngology/Head and Neck Surgery, University Hospital Vrije Universiteit, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoids)', '0 (retinoic acid binding protein I, cellular)', '0 (retinoic acid binding protein II, cellular)', '38030-57-8 (4-oxoretinoic acid)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/*metabolism', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Culture Media/chemistry', 'Head and Neck Neoplasms/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/biosynthesis', 'Retinoids/*metabolism', 'Tretinoin/analogs & derivatives/*metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1997/01/01 00:00,1997/01/01 00:01,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/bjc.1997.361 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1997;76(2):189-97. doi: 10.1038/bjc.1997.361.,,,,,PMC2223946,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Blood lymphocytes were isolated from 12 patients with persistent CD3+CD8+ lymphocytosis with LGL morphology. Clonal rearrangements of the TCR gene were demonstrated by SB hybridisation with a TCR beta constant probe, and by PCR amplification of portions of the TCR beta and TCR gamma genes. RESULTS: Monoclonal TCR beta gene rearrangements were detected in eight patients (67%) by PCR analysis and five patients (42%) by SB hybridisation. PCR analysis also showed that seven patients (58%) had monoclonal TCR gamma gene rearrangements. All cases which had TCR beta clonal rearrangements shown by SB hybridisation were similarly identified by PCR. Sensitivity tests suggested that the TCR beta PCR technique was capable of detecting clonality in as little as 50 pg of DNA. The TCR beta primers could detect one clonal cell in approximately 200 or more normal cells (< 0.5%), a sensitivity level that at least doubles that of the SB hybridisation technique. CONCLUSIONS: The use of PCR technology proved to be superior to SB hybridisation for the routine investigation of suspected cases of LGL leukaemia. Nine patients (75%) in this study were found to have TCR beta and/or TCR gamma monoclonal gene rearrangements. This approach is ideal for distinguishing between reactive and clonal LGL proliferation in a routine diagnostic laboratory.","['Ryan, D K', 'Alexander, H D', 'Morris, T C']","['Ryan DK', 'Alexander HD', 'Morris TC']","['Department of Haematology, Balfast City Hospital.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Mol Pathol,Molecular pathology : MP,9706282,,IM,"['Blotting, Southern/standards', '*Gene Rearrangement, beta-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor', '*Gene Rearrangement, gamma-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/standards', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",1997/04/01 00:00,1997/04/01 00:01,['1997/04/01 00:00'],"['1997/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/mp.50.2.77 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Pathol. 1997 Apr;50(2):77-81. doi: 10.1136/mp.50.2.77.,,,,,PMC379587,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVE: We have aimed to determine the efficacy and safety of growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) (1-29)-NH2 given as a twice daily subcutaneous injection in the treatment of growth failure in children with radiation-induced GH deficiency. DESIGN: A multicentre study comparing growth before and after 1 year of treatment with GHRH (1-29)-NH2, 15 micrograms/kg twice daily, by subcutaneous injection in children with radiation-induced GH deficiency. On completion of the study year all children were treated with GH (0.5 U/kg/week) and growth parameters were documented over the next year. PATIENTS: Nine children (six boys) with radiation-induced GH deficiency following cranial (n = 4) or craniospinal (n = 5) irradiation for a brain tumour distant from the hypothalamic-pituitary axis (n = 8) or prophylaxis against central nervous system leukaemia (n = 1) were studied. All were prepubertal when the study commenced, which was at least 2 years from radiotherapy. MEASUREMENTS: Anthropometry and pubertal staging were carried out at 3-monthly intervals and bone age estimations at 6-monthly intervals (TW2 method). Pretreatment standing height velocities were compared with values during the year of GHRH treatment and then after the first year of GH therapy. In those that had received craniospinal irradiation, a change in leg-length Standard deviation score (SDS) was noted before and after GHRH therapy. Changes in skin-fold thickness and bone age during the GHRH study year were documented. Adverse events and 3-monthly measurements of clinical chemistry, haematology, lipid profile and thyroid function were recorded. RESULTS: There was a significant increase in height velocity from 3.3 (SD 1.1) cm/year before treatment, to 6.0 (SDS 1.5) cm/year after 1 year of GHRH treatment (P = 0.004). GHRH maintained or improved the leg length SDS in children who had received craniospinal irradiation. Bone age increased by a mean of 1.1 years/chronological year during treatment with GHRH. Subsequent height velocity during 1 year of GH therapy was 7.5 (SD 1.5)cm/year. No adverse changes in biochemical or hormonal analyses were noted or adverse events that could be attributed to GHRH therapy. One child went into puberty during the GHRH study year and three were pubertal during the first year of GH therapy. CONCLUSION: In cranially irradiated children, GHRH was effective in increasing growth velocity but this was less than that seen in response to GH therapy, although it matched that in children with isolated idiopathic GH deficiency treated with the same dose and schedule of GHRH administration.","['Ogilvy-Stuart, A L', 'Stirling, H F', 'Kelnar, C J', 'Savage, M O', 'Dunger, D B', 'Buckler, J M', 'Shalet, S M']","['Ogilvy-Stuart AL', 'Stirling HF', 'Kelnar CJ', 'Savage MO', 'Dunger DB', 'Buckler JM', 'Shalet SM']","['Department of Endocrinology, Christie Hospital NHS Trust, Manchester, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Clin Endocrinol (Oxf),Clinical endocrinology,0346653,"['86168-78-7 (Sermorelin)', '9002-72-6 (Growth Hormone)']",IM,"['Age Determination by Skeleton', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Growth Disorders/*drug therapy/etiology', 'Growth Hormone/*deficiency/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Hypothalamus/*radiation effects', 'Injections, Subcutaneous', 'Male', 'Puberty', 'Radiotherapy/*adverse effects', 'Sermorelin/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Skinfold Thickness']",1997/05/01 00:00,1997/05/01 00:01,['1997/05/01 00:00'],"['1997/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-2265.1997.1790998.x [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Endocrinol (Oxf). 1997 May;46(5):571-8. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2265.1997.1790998.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of estrogen and progestin on the migration of monocytes induced by minimally oxidized low-density lipoprotein (m-ox-LDL) in vitro. METHODS: Human monocytic THP-1 cells were used for the study. Migration assay was performed using a modified Boyden chamber. RESULTS: The presence of estrogen receptors was determined in THP-1 cells by Western and Northern blot analysis. Although native LDL had no significant effects on the migration of THP-1 cells, m-ox-LDL increased the migration of THP-1 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Although 17 beta-estradiol (E2, 10(-9)-10(-6) M) inhibited the 10 micrograms/ml-induced migration of THP-1 cells in a dose-dependent manner, estrone (E1), estriol (E3) and progesterone (P) had no significant effects. The combination of P (10(-9)-10(-6) M) did not show any effect on the inhibitory effect of 10(-7) M E2. Preincubation of THP-1 cells with the anti-estrogenic agent, tamoxifen (10(-6) M), significantly antagonized the inhibitory effect of 10(-7) M E2. m-ox-LDL stimulated MCP-1 secretion from THP-1 cells, which was reduced by E2. Anti-human MCP-1 neutralizing antibody inhibited the migration of THP-1 cells stimulated by m-ox-LDL. E2 also inhibited the 10 ng/ml MCP-1-induced migration of THP-1 cells in a dose-dependent manner. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the inhibitory effect of E2 on the migration of monocytes might be one of the factors involved in the decreased incidence of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in premenopausal women and postmenopausal HRT.","['Okada, M', 'Suzuki, A', 'Mizuno, K', 'Asada, Y', 'Ino, Y', 'Kuwayama, T', 'Tamakoshi, K', 'Mizutani, S', 'Tomoda, Y']","['Okada M', 'Suzuki A', 'Mizuno K', 'Asada Y', 'Ino Y', 'Kuwayama T', 'Tamakoshi K', 'Mizutani S', 'Tomoda Y']","['Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Nagoya University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Cardiovasc Res,Cardiovascular research,0077427,"['0 (Estrogen Antagonists)', '0 (Lipoproteins, LDL)', '094ZI81Y45 (Tamoxifen)', '4G7DS2Q64Y (Progesterone)', '4TI98Z838E (Estradiol)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Arteriosclerosis/prevention & control', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Movement/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Estradiol/*pharmacology', 'Estrogen Antagonists/pharmacology', 'Estrogen Replacement Therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute', 'Lipoproteins, LDL/*pharmacology', 'Middle Aged', 'Models, Biological', 'Monocytes/*drug effects/physiology', 'Progesterone/*pharmacology', 'Tamoxifen/pharmacology']",1997/06/01 00:00,1997/06/01 00:01,['1997/06/01 00:00'],"['1997/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0008636397000606 [pii]', '10.1016/s0008-6363(97)00060-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Cardiovasc Res. 1997 Jun;34(3):529-35. doi: 10.1016/s0008-6363(97)00060-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Chinese Academy of Preventive Medicine--National Cancer Institute Benzene Study Group.,1065-71,"BACKGROUND: Benzene is a widely distributed environmental contaminant known to cause leukemia, particularly acute nonlymphocytic leukemia, and perhaps other hematologic neoplasms and disorders. Few epidemiologic studies, however, have been able to address relationships between the extent of benzene exposure and the level of risk. PURPOSE: A large cohort study was carried out in China to evaluate the risks of developing specific hematologic neoplasms and selected related disorders in relationship to quantitative estimates of occupational benzene exposure. METHODS: A cohort of 74828 benzene-exposed and 35805 unexposed workers employed from 1972 through 1987 in 12 cities in China was identified and followed to determine the incidence of hematologic neoplasms and related disorders. Estimates of benzene exposure were derived from work histories and available historic benzene measurements. Existing pathologic material and supporting medical records were reviewed to establish diagnoses of disease. Relative risks (RRs) (i.e., ratios of incidence rates for specific hematologic neoplasms and related disorders in the benzene-exposed group to incidence rates in the unexposed group) were determined by use of Poisson regression analysis, with stratification by age and sex. RESULTS: For workers historically exposed to benzene at average levels of less than 10 parts per million (ppm), the RR for all hematologic neoplasm combined was 2.2 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.1-4.2), and, for the combination of acute nonlymphocytic leukemia and related myelodysplastic syndromes, the RR was 3.2 (95% CI = 1.0-10.1). For individuals who were occupationally exposed to benzene at constant levels of 25 ppm or more, the RR for the combination of acute nonlymphocytic leukemia and related myelodysplastic syndromes was 7.1 (95% CI = 2.1-23.7). Workers with 10 or more years of benzene exposure had an RR of developing non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of 4.2 (95% CI = 1.1-15.9), and the development of this neoplasm was linked most strongly to exposure that had occurred at least 10 years before diagnosis (i.e., distant exposure) (P for trend = .005, two-sided). In contrast, the risk for the combination of acute nonlymphocytic leukemia and related myelodysplastic syndromes was significantly increased among those with more recent benzene exposure (P for trend = .003, two-sided), but it was not linked to distant exposure (P for trend = .51, two-sided). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that benzene exposure is associated with a spectrum of hematologic neoplasms and related disorders in humans. Risks for these conditions are elevated at average benzene-exposure levels of less than 10 ppm and show a tendency, although not a strong one, to rise with increasing levels of exposure. The temporal pattern of benzene exposure appears to be important in determining the risk of developing specific diseases.","['Hayes, R B', 'Yin, S N', 'Dosemeci, M', 'Li, G L', 'Wacholder, S', 'Travis, L B', 'Li, C Y', 'Rothman, N', 'Hoover, R N', 'Linet, M S']","['Hayes RB', 'Yin SN', 'Dosemeci M', 'Li GL', 'Wacholder S', 'Travis LB', 'Li CY', 'Rothman N', 'Hoover RN', 'Linet MS']","['Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,['J64922108F (Benzene)'],IM,"['Age Distribution', 'Benzene/*adverse effects', 'China/epidemiology', 'Cohort Studies', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*chemically induced/*epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Occupational Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Poisson Distribution', 'Risk', 'Sex Distribution', 'Time Factors']",1997/07/16 00:00,1997/07/16 00:01,['1997/07/16 00:00'],"['1997/07/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/07/16 00:01 [medline]', '1997/07/16 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/jnci/89.14.1065 [doi]'],ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1997 Jul 16;89(14):1065-71. doi: 10.1093/jnci/89.14.1065.,,,,"['J Natl Cancer Inst. 1997 Nov 19;89(22):1728-9.

Western blot analysis with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody revealed a dramatic increase in phosphorylation of two major protein bands of Mr approximately 80,000 and approximately 55,000 in response to PDT. The increase was PDT dose-dependent, occurred as early as 20 s after initiation of light exposure of Pc 4-preloaded cells and was amplified by the presence of the protein tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, sodium orthovanadate (NaVO4). By immunoprecipitation, one of the Mr approximately 80,000 phosphorylated proteins has been identified as HS1, a substrate of nonreceptor-type protein tyrosine kinases. Although vanadate greatly enhanced the level and extent of PDT-induced phosphorylation, it had no influence on overall photocytotoxicity or on the rate of apoptotic DNA fragmentation. Genistein, an inhibitor of protein tyrosine kinases, diminished tyrosine phosphorylation of the Mr approximately 80,000 and other proteins and dramatically potentiated cell killing induced by PDT but did not significantly affect PDT-induced apoptosis. The results suggest that PDT rapidly activates a membrane-associated src family kinase(s) in L5178Y-R cells, one substrate of which is HS1, and that protein tyrosine phosphorylation is part of a stress response, protecting a portion of the cells from the lethal effects of PDT but not altering the mechanism by which they die.","['Xue, L Y', 'He, J', 'Oleinick, N L']","['Xue LY', 'He J', 'Oleinick NL']","['Division of Radiation Biology, Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, Cleveland, OH, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Photochem Photobiol,Photochemistry and photobiology,0376425,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Blood Proteins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (HCLS1 protein, human)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Isoflavones)', '0 (Photosensitizing Agents)', '0 (phthalocyanine Pc 4)', '21820-51-9 (Phosphotyrosine)', '3WHH0066W5 (Vanadates)', 'DH2M523P0H (Genistein)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Blood Proteins/drug effects/*metabolism/radiation effects', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Genistein', 'Indoles/*toxicity', 'Isoflavones/pharmacology', 'Leukemia L5178', 'Light', 'Mice', 'Molecular Weight', 'Phosphorylation', '*Phosphotyrosine', '*Photochemotherapy', 'Photosensitizing Agents/*toxicity', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vanadates/pharmacology']",1997/07/01 00:00,1997/07/01 00:01,['1997/07/01 00:00'],"['1997/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1751-1097.1997.tb03145.x [doi]'],ppublish,Photochem Photobiol. 1997 Jul;66(1):105-13. doi: 10.1111/j.1751-1097.1997.tb03145.x.,,,"['P01 CA48735/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA15378/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA63669/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because exposure to natural or medicinal substances blocking topo II during pregnancy have been proposed as etiological agents for infant leukemia, we have compared the distribution of ALL1 gene breakpoints in infant leukemias with an altered ALL1 gene configuration to those in secondary leukemia associated with prior exposure to topo II targeting drugs and in reference to the major topo consensus binding site in exon 9. ALL1 gene breakpoint distribution was determined by Southern blot hybridization and/or reverse transcription-PCR of the ALL1/AF4 fusion cDNA in 70 patients. Using restriction enzyme analysis, the 8.3-kb ALL1 breakpoint cluster region was divided in a centromeric portion of 3.5 kb (region A) and telomeric portion of a 4.8 kb (region B). ALL1 breakpoint were located in region A in 8 of 28 (28.5%) cases of infant ALs, 16 of 24 (66%) cases of de novo ALs, and 0 of 5 cases of therapy-related (TR) ALs. Conversely, ALL1 breakpoints in region B were detected in 20 of 28 (71.5%) cases of infant AL, 8 of 24 (33%) cases of de novo AL, and 5 of 5 (100%) cases of TR AL (P = 0.002). These results were confirmed by direct sequencing of the ALL1/AF4 fusion transcript in 30 cases (19 infants and 11 child and adult de novo cases). The analysis of ALL1/AF4 junction types showed that children and adults with de novo leukemia had ALL1 breakpoints in intron 6 (9 cases) or intron 7 (2 cases), whereas breakpoints in infant cases were mainly located in intron 8 (14 cases) and less frequently in intron 6 (4 cases) and intron 7 (1 case). The difference in ALL1 breakpoint location between infant and noninfant AL patients with ALL1/AF4 fusion was statistically significant (P = 0.00005). These data demonstrated that infant and TR ALs share a similar biased clustering of ALL1 gene breakpoints, which supports the possibility that topo II inhibitors may also operate in utero and play a crucial role in the etiology of infant leukemia.","['Cimino, G', 'Rapanotti, M C', 'Biondi, A', 'Elia, L', 'Lo Coco, F', 'Price, C', 'Rossi, V', 'Rivolta, A', 'Canaani, E', 'Croce, C M', 'Mandelli, F', 'Greaves, M']","['Cimino G', 'Rapanotti MC', 'Biondi A', 'Elia L', 'Lo Coco F', 'Price C', 'Rossi V', 'Rivolta A', 'Canaani E', 'Croce CM', 'Mandelli F', 'Greaves M']","['Dipartimento di Biotecnologie Cellulari ed Ematologia, University La Sapienza, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*genetics', '*Proto-Oncogenes', '*Topoisomerase II Inhibitors', '*Transcription Factors']",1997/07/15 00:00,1997/07/15 00:01,['1997/07/15 00:00'],"['1997/07/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/07/15 00:01 [medline]', '1997/07/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1997 Jul 15;57(14):2879-83.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To evaluate the impact of interindividual variation in enzymes that activate (i.e., CYP2E1) and detoxify (i.e., NQO1) benzene and its metabolites, we carried out a case-control study in Shanghai, China, of occupational benzene poisoning (BP; i.e., hematotoxicity), which we show is itself strongly associated with subsequent development of acute nonlymphocytic leukemia and the related myelodysplastic syndromes (relative risk, 70.6; 95% confidence interval, 11.4-439.3). CYP2E1 and NQO1 genotypes were determined by PCR-RFLP, and CYP2E1 enzymatic activity was estimated by the fractional excretion of chlorzoxazone (fe(6-OH)) for 50 cases of BP and 50 controls. Subjects with both a rapid fe(6-OH). and two copies of the NQO1 609C-->T mutation had a 7.6-fold (95% confidence interval, 1.8-31.2) increased risk of BP compared to subjects with a slow fe(6-OH) who carried one or two wild-type NQO1 alleles. In contrast, the CYP2E1 PstI/RsaI polymorphism did not influence BP risk. This is the first report that provides evidence of human susceptibility to benzene-related disease.

PML and Sp100 gene expression is strongly enhanced by interferons (IFN). Based on immunostaining with a monoclonal antibody (mAb C8A2), a third protein, nuclear dot protein 52 (NDP52), was recently localized in NDs. Here we analyzed the cellular localization, expression, and structure of NDP52 in more detail. Our NDP52-specific sera revealed mainly cytoplasmic staining but no ND pattern, neither in untreated nor in IFN-treated cells. Cells transfected with NDP52 expression vectors showed exclusively cytoplasmic staining. In subcellular fractionation experiments, NDP52 was found in cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions. Unlike as described for Sp100 and PML, NDP52 mRNA and protein levels were only marginally enhanced by IFN gamma and not enhanced at all by IFN beta. NDP52 homodimerization but no heterodimerization with Sp100 or PML could be demonstrated. None of the 93 PBC sera tested contained autoantibodies against NDP52. Finally, mAb C8A2 reacted not only with NDP52 but also with a conformation-dependent epitope on the Sp100 protein. These data imply that NDP52 forms homodimers but no heterodimers with Sp100 and PML, lacks autoantigenicity in PBC, localizes mainly in the cytoplasm, and is associated with the nucleus, but not with NDs. Finally, unlike Sp100 and PML, NDP52 expression is neither markedly enhanced nor localization detectably altered by type I and II IFNs.","['Sternsdorf, T', 'Jensen, K', 'Zuchner, D', 'Will, H']","['Sternsdorf T', 'Jensen K', 'Zuchner D', 'Will H']","['Heinrich-Pette-Institut fur experimentelle Virologie und Immunologie an der Universitat Hamburg, D-20251 Hamburg, FRG.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Cell Biol,The Journal of cell biology,0375356,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Nuclear)', '0 (Autoantibodies)', '0 (Autoantigens)', '0 (CALCOCO2 protein, human)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '135844-47-2 (Sp100 protein, human)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', '77238-31-4 (Interferon-beta)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', '*Antigens, Nuclear', 'Autoantibodies/blood', 'Autoantigens/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/*chemistry', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Cross Reactions', 'Cytoplasm/*chemistry', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'Dimerization', 'Gene Expression', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Interferon-beta/pharmacology', 'Interferon-gamma/pharmacology', 'Liver Cirrhosis, Biliary/immunology', '*Neoplasm Proteins', 'Nuclear Proteins/*analysis/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Rats', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",1997/07/28 00:00,1997/07/28 00:01,['1997/07/28 00:00'],"['1997/07/28 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/07/28 00:01 [medline]', '1997/07/28 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1083/jcb.138.2.435 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biol. 1997 Jul 28;138(2):435-48. doi: 10.1083/jcb.138.2.435.,,,,,PMC2138200,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many different epidemiological studies discuss the relation between the high risk for cancer mortality and low blood cholesterol in patients with colon, rectum, ovary and brain cancer as well as in chronic myeloid leukaemia, acute leukaemia and policytemia vera. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two groups were studied: a normal group (n = 32) was confronted to a group of oncohaematologic patients (n = 37) (15 lymphoma, 4 acute leukaemia, 7 chronic myeloid leukaemia, 1 chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia, 3 policytemia vera, 5 myeloma and 2 chronic lymphoid leukaemia). In all the cases we determinated the total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, A1 y B apolipoproteins. RESULTS: The means obtained in the normal group were 184.63 mg/dL, 50.34 mg/dL, 116.38 mg/dL, 140.93 mg/dL, 79.57 mg/dL while in the pathologic group were 163.43 mg/dL, 38.19 mg/dL, 106.60 mg/dL, 102.81 mg/dL and 101.23 mg/dL, respectively. There was a significant difference in the total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein A1. These values were lower for leukocytes higher than 10.0 x 10(9)/L. Furthermore the lowest total cholesterol value was seen in myeloma patients. CONCLUSION: The cholesterol, its fractions and the apolipoproteins determinations might be considered as a biochemical marker while diagnostic is being made, since they are known to play an important role in the tumoral cell metabolism.","['Aixala, M', 'Sarandria, C N', 'Speroni, J G']","['Aixala M', 'Sarandria CN', 'Speroni JG']","['Departamento de Apoyo Medico, Academia Nacional de Buenos Aires, Argentina.']",['spa'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Spain,Sangre (Barc),Sangre,0404373,"['0 (Apolipoprotein A-I)', '0 (Apolipoproteins B)', '0 (Cholesterol, HDL)', '0 (Cholesterol, LDL)', '97C5T2UQ7J (Cholesterol)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Apolipoprotein A-I/blood', 'Apolipoproteins B/blood', 'Cholesterol/blood/*deficiency', 'Cholesterol, HDL/blood', 'Cholesterol, LDL/blood', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*blood', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",1997/02/01 00:00,1997/02/01 00:01,['1997/02/01 00:00'],"['1997/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Sangre (Barc). 1997 Feb;42(1):7-10.,,,,,,Hipocolesterolemia en neoplasias hematologicas.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: 11 acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) patients (9 M3 and 2 M3v) were studied at diagnosis and partial remission and analyzed with CC (11 cases), SB (7 cases), I-FISH (2 cases) and PCR (3 cases) techniques.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Mononuclear cells of 17 patients with CML in BC were immunophenotyped employing a panel of 18 monoclonal antibodies: CD5, CD10, CD14, CD22, and anti-HLA-DR used in all patients; CD2, CD15, CD19, CD34, and CD41 in 13 to 16 patients; and CD3, CD7, CD13, CD20, CD21, CD33, CD42b, and CD61 in less than 10 patients. RESULTS: Myeloid was the most frequent type (9/17 cases) followed by lymphoid (6/17) and hybrid or mixed lineage (2/17). Four of the myeloid BC expressed megakaryocyte/platelet associated antigens; 5 of 6 cases with lymphoid BC showed an early precursor B cell immunophenotype (HLA-DR+, CD10+), and the other was an uncommon case of lymphoid B/T transformation (CD19+, CD5+). The CD34 antigen was present in 6 out of 15 cases: 4 patients with lymphoid BC, 1 with myeloid transformation, and 1 with megakaryoblastic BC. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings are comparable to those found in the literature comprising 192 patients.

The fourth bout continued as undulating periods of fever with markedly impaired general state. Physical examination was unremarkable except for mild generalised lymphadenopathy. INVESTIGATIONS: Extensive imaging and serological studies failed to find an infectious or autoimmunological cause. But computed tomography and angiography revealed a space-occupying lesion in the left kidney, yet the suspected diagnosis of renal carcinoma insufficiently explained the clinical picture. DIAGNOSIS TREATMENT AND COURSE: Haematological tests having shown anaemia (Hb 8.1 g/dl) and blast cells (10%) in the peripheral blood a bone marrow biopsy was performed which indicated acute myeloid leukaemia. Three courses of intensive chemotherapy brought about only partial remission and the patient died 6 months later from a cerebral haemorrhage. An autopsy confirmed both the acute myeloid leukaemia and a renal carcinoma. CONCLUSION: The possibility of synchronous occurrence of two malignancies should always be kept in mind especially if the initially diagnosed tumor cannot explain the clinical symptoms.","['Bohle, W', 'Ruther, U', 'Bokemeyer, C', 'Jipp, P']","['Bohle W', 'Ruther U', 'Bokemeyer C', 'Jipp P']","['Zentrum fur Innere Medizin, Katharinenhospital Stuttgart.']",['ger'],"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Germany,Dtsch Med Wochenschr,Deutsche medizinische Wochenschrift (1946),0006723,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Carcinoma/*diagnosis/drug therapy/pathology', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Humans', 'Kidney Neoplasms/*diagnosis/drug therapy/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*diagnosis/drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Multiple Primary/*diagnosis/drug therapy/pathology']",1997/06/06 00:00,1997/06/06 00:01,['1997/06/06 00:00'],"['1997/06/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/06/06 00:01 [medline]', '1997/06/06 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1055/s-2008-1047683 [doi]'],ppublish,Dtsch Med Wochenschr. 1997 Jun 6;122(23):743-6. doi: 10.1055/s-2008-1047683.,15,,,,,Synchrones Auftreten von akuter myeloischer Leukamie und Nierenkarzinom.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, we and others have shown that specific recognition of target sites in DNA is partly achieved through cooperative interaction with the extradenticle/pre-B-cell transformation-related gene (EXD/PBX) family of homeodomain-containing proteins. This interaction is mediated by the YPWM motif present N-terminal to the homeodomain in HOX proteins. In the present study, we use YPWM peptides to confirm the importance of this motif for mediating HOX/PBX interactions. We also used a novel monoclonal antibody directed against the YPWM to show that occlusion of this motif abrogates cooperativity with PBX. In addition, we present evidence that residues flanking the YPWM, both N-terminally and C-terminally, stabilize the HOX.PBX cooperative complex. Because these flanking residues are also conserved among paralogs, they are likely to help distinguish the specificity of HOX/PBX interactions. Our data further show that the relative importance of individual residues within and flanking the YPWM is dependent on the identity of position 6 of the cooperative binding site (TGATTNATGG). These results suggest that interactions between PBX and the YPWM motif are modified by a base pair predicted to contact the N-terminal arm of the HOX homeodomain.","['Shanmugam, K', 'Featherstone, M S', 'Saragovi, H U']","['Shanmugam K', 'Featherstone MS', 'Saragovi HU']","['McGill Cancer Centre, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec H3G 1Y6, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Hoxd4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (homeobox A1 protein)', '0 (pbx1 protein, human)', '145420-66-2 (HOXD10 protein, human)', 'OF5P57N2ZX (Alanine)']",IM,"['Alanine/genetics', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Binding Sites/genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Epitope Mapping', 'Homeodomain Proteins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Peptide Fragments/genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation']",1997/07/25 00:00,1997/07/25 00:01,['1997/07/25 00:00'],"['1997/07/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/07/25 00:01 [medline]', '1997/07/25 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.272.30.19081 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(18)39091-4 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1997 Jul 25;272(30):19081-7. doi: 10.1074/jbc.272.30.19081.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study we investigated the effect of Zn2+ on an earlier event in the apoptotic process, the proteolysis of the ""death substrate"" poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). Pretreatment of intact Molt4 leukemia cells with micromolar concentrations of Zn2+ caused an inhibition of PARP proteolysis induced by the chemotherapeutic agent etoposide. Using a cell-free system consisting of purified bovine PARP as a substrate and an apoptotic extract or recombinant caspase-3 as the PARP protease, Zn2+ inhibited PARP proteolysis in the low micromolar range. To rule out an effect of Zn2+ on PARP, a protein with two zinc finger domains, we used recombinant caspase-3 and a chromogenic tetrapeptide substrate containing the caspase-3 cleavage site. In this system, Zn2+ inhibited caspase-3 with an IC50 of 0.1 microM. These results identify caspase-3 as a novel target of Zn2+ inhibition in apoptosis and suggest a regulatory role for Zn2+ in modulating the upstream apoptotic machinery.","['Perry, D K', 'Smyth, M J', 'Stennicke, H R', 'Salvesen, G S', 'Duriez, P', 'Poirier, G G', 'Hannun, Y A']","['Perry DK', 'Smyth MJ', 'Stennicke HR', 'Salvesen GS', 'Duriez P', 'Poirier GG', 'Hannun YA']","['Department of Medicine, Duke University Medical Center, Education and Clinical Center (GRECC) Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina 27710, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Enzyme Precursors)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'J41CSQ7QDS (Zinc)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 3', '*Caspases', 'Catalysis', 'Cattle', 'Cell-Free System', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/*metabolism', 'Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Enzyme Precursors/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Zinc/*pharmacology']",1997/07/25 00:00,1997/07/25 00:01,['1997/07/25 00:00'],"['1997/07/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/07/25 00:01 [medline]', '1997/07/25 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.272.30.18530 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(18)39013-6 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1997 Jul 25;272(30):18530-3. doi: 10.1074/jbc.272.30.18530.,,,['GM-43825/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

French Chronic Myeloid Leukemia Study Group.,223-9,"BACKGROUND: Treatment with interferon prolongs survival in chronic myelogenous leukemia. We conducted a clinical trial to assess the efficacy of treatment with a combination of interferon and cytarabine. METHODS: Previously untreated patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia were randomly assigned to receive either hydroxyurea (50 mg per kilogram of body weight per day) and interferon alfa-2b (5 million units per square meter of body-surface area per day), or hydroxyurea and interferon in the same dosages plus monthly courses of cytarabine (20 mg per square meter per day, for 10 days). The end points were overall survival, complete hematologic remission at 6 months, and major cytogenetic response (less than 35 percent Philadelphia chromosome-positive cells in the bone marrow) at 12 months. RESULTS: The trial was stopped when a sequential analysis showed a benefit of interferon and cytarabine. A significant improvement in survival was observed in the interferon-cytarabine group (360 patients) as compared with the interferon group (361 patients) (P=0.02; relative risk of death, 0.64; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.44 to 0.93). After three years, the survival rate was 85.7 percent with interferon and cytarabine and 79.1 percent with interferon alone. The rate of hematologic response was higher in the interferon-cytarabine group than in the interferon group (P=0.003). Major cytogenetic responses were observed 12 months after randomization in 126 of 311 patients treated with interferon and cytarabine (41 percent) and in 75 of 314 patients treated with interferon only (24 percent, P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The combination of interferon and cytarabine, as compared with interferon alone, increases the rate of major cytogenetic response and prolongs survival in patients with the chronic phase of chronic myelogenous leukemia.","['Guilhot, F', 'Chastang, C', 'Michallet, M', 'Guerci, A', 'Harousseau, J L', 'Maloisel, F', 'Bouabdallah, R', 'Guyotat, D', 'Cheron, N', 'Nicolini, F', 'Abgrall, J F', 'Tanzer, J']","['Guilhot F', 'Chastang C', 'Michallet M', 'Guerci A', 'Harousseau JL', 'Maloisel F', 'Bouabdallah R', 'Guyotat D', 'Cheron N', 'Nicolini F', 'Abgrall JF', 'Tanzer J']","['Hopital Jean Bernard, Poitiers, France.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,N Engl J Med,The New England journal of medicine,0255562,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Interferon alpha-2)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytarabine/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/administration & dosage', 'Interferon alpha-2', 'Interferon-alpha/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Regression Analysis', 'Survival Analysis']",1997/07/24 00:00,1997/07/24 00:01,['1997/07/24 00:00'],"['1997/07/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/07/24 00:01 [medline]', '1997/07/24 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1056/NEJM199707243370402 [doi]'],ppublish,N Engl J Med. 1997 Jul 24;337(4):223-9. doi: 10.1056/NEJM199707243370402.,,,,"['N Engl J Med. 1997 Jul 24;337(4):270-1.

Twenty-six patients received granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) post-transplant as part of a phase II study. Fifty-four patients (74%) had advanced disease. AIMS: To identify factors associated with a superior outcome post-transplant, to evaluate the effect of GM-CSF on engraftment and other transplant parameters, and to compare the overall results with those of published series. METHODS: Review of patient records, a Medline search of the relevant literature and appropriate statistical analysis. RESULTS: The probability of overall survival and event-free survival (EFS) at three years was 35 +/- 6% and 22 +/- 6% respectively. Pre-transplant factors significantly associated with an inferior EFS were advanced disease, poorer performance status and age > 30 years. The EFS in patients with standard risk disease was 51 +/- 13% versus 10 +/- 5% in patients with advanced disease, p < 0.0001. Severe acute graft-versus-host disease was also associated with a poorer outcome. Neutrophil engraftment was faster in patients who received GM-CSF but there was no difference in any other transplant parameters. CONCLUSIONS: These results are consistent with reported series elsewhere and suggest that an extended family or unrelated donor transplant should generally be limited to patients with a good performance status and early phase but otherwise incurable haematological disease.","['Grigg, A', 'Morton, J', 'Durrant, S', 'Bardy, P', 'Szer, J']","['Grigg A', 'Morton J', 'Durrant S', 'Bardy P', 'Szer J']","['Department of Clinical Haematology and Medical Oncology, Royal Melbourne Hospital, Vic.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Australia,Aust N Z J Med,Australian and New Zealand journal of medicine,1264322,"['0 (HLA Antigens)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Clinical Trials, Phase II as Topic', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/therapeutic use', '*HLA Antigens', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*surgery', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/surgery', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/surgery', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/surgery', 'Male', 'Patient Selection', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome']",1997/06/01 00:00,1997/06/01 00:01,['1997/06/01 00:00'],"['1997/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1445-5994.1997.tb01984.x [doi]'],ppublish,Aust N Z J Med. 1997 Jun;27(3):311-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1445-5994.1997.tb01984.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most clinical trials have selected patient populations with young median ages and it is therefore difficult to apply results to the general population where the majority of patients presenting with acute leukaemia are over 60 years. There is little information in the literature guiding appropriate treatment of these patients. AIMS: To determine the relationship between age, treatment received, and outcome in patients presenting with acute leukaemia. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed on all patients presenting to Prince Henry's Hospital and Monash Medical Centre with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) or acute lymphocytic leukaemia (ALL) during a five year period. RESULTS: Sixty-six patients (51-AML, 15-ALL) presented with acute leukaemia between March 1989 and April 1994. Median patient age was 63 years; 32% of patients received supportive therapy only; 86% of patients with ALL and 58% of patients with AML commencing remission-induction chemotherapy entered a complete remission. Median survival for patients receiving only supportive therapy was three months. Median survival in patients under 55 years was almost twice as long as patients over 55 years receiving similar treatment (AML-eight vs four months p = 0.023; ALL-3.5 vs seven months p = 0.029). CONCLUSIONS: Median survival for acute leukaemia is inversely proportional to age.

TdT is known as a useful marker for the diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia/lymphoma, but its detection usually requires fresh tissue specimens or cell suspensions, using either an enzyme analysis or immuno-fluorescence or -peroxidase staining. Until the recent development of the use of microwave-treated paraffin sections for immunoperoxidase staining, detection of TdT in paraffin sections required rather complicated processes. This new simple technique was applied to paraffin sections from the tumour tissue specimens of 16 patients with lymphoblastic lymphoma and of seven patients with non-endemic Burkitt's lymphoma, which is sometimes difficult to differentiate from lymphoblastic lymphoma because of their similar clinicopathological characteristics. In addition, as a control, ten cases each were examined of adult T-cell leukaemia/lymphoma (ATLL) and angioimmunoblastic lymphoma (AILD), which are both peripheral T-cell lymphomas. The tumour cells from 15 of the 16 (94 per cent) patients with lymphoblastic lymphoma were found to be TdT-positive. The specificity of the anti-TdT antibody used was confirmed by immunoblot and the specific 60 kD band was detected only in a specimen of lymphoblastic lymphoma. These results show that the immunostaining of TdT on paraffin-embedded sections is a useful method for differentiating lymphoblastic lymphoma from other lymphomas. This method is applicable to a routine diagnostic service.","['Suzumiya, J', 'Ohshima, K', 'Kikuchi, M', 'Takeshita, M', 'Akamatsu, M', 'Tashiro, K']","['Suzumiya J', 'Ohshima K', 'Kikuchi M', 'Takeshita M', 'Akamatsu M', 'Tashiro K']","['First Department of Pathology, Fukuoka University, School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Pathol,The Journal of pathology,0204634,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', 'EC 2.7.7.31 (DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/diagnosis', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase/*analysis', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/diagnosis', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell, Peripheral/diagnosis', 'Male', 'Microwaves', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis']",1997/05/01 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1997/05/01 00:00'],"['1997/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1997/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1096-9896(199705)182:1<86::AID-PATH821>3.0.CO;2-I [pii]', '10.1002/(SICI)1096-9896(199705)182:1<86::AID-PATH821>3.0.CO;2-I [doi]']",ppublish,J Pathol. 1997 May;182(1):86-91. doi: 10.1002/(SICI)1096-9896(199705)182:1<86::AID-PATH821>3.0.CO;2-I.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The assay involves extracting lipids from plasma with methylene chloride and methanol, purification on Zorbax SIL column with 5.5% (v/v) iso-propanol in hexane and quantification by HPLC-ECD. A coulometric system, composed of the dual electrode analytical cell and a guard cell, was used for ECD of the eluting compounds. The potentials applied to detectors 1 and 2 in a dual electrode analytical cell were adjusted to +0.20 V and +0.60 V, respectively. This method is sensitive to 20 pg of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 [25(OH)D3] and of 24R,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [24,25(OH)2D3]. Calibration curves gave linearity from 20-1000 pg for 25(OH)D3 and 24,25(OH)2D3. The detection limit was approximately 50 pg ml-1 for 25(OH)D3 and 24,25(OH)2D3 in plasma. This sensitivity combined with an overall recovery of 25(OH)D3 (81.5 +/- 2.6%, mean +/- S.E.) allows the measurement of trace amount of 25(OH)D3 with only 20 microliters of plasma. Intra- and interassay RSD values were 5.3 and 9.7% for 25(OH)D3 and 6.3 and 9.7% for 24,25(OH)2D3, respectively. Plasma levels of 25(OH)D3 and 24,25(OH)2D3 in normal adults were 15.9 +/- 2.8 ng ml-1 (n = 10) and 1.4 +/- 0.5 ng ml-1 (n = 10), respectively. This method allows the determination of 25(OH)D2 and 25(OH)D3 for evaluating their nutritional and clinical status.

Furthermore, PMNs, particularly early in ATRA treatment, lacked neutrophil secondary granules as did the PMNs appearing in a culture of APL cells incubated with ATRA, findings consistent with previously reported data that acute myeloid leukemia cell lines do not produce secondary granule proteins even after induction of differentiation towards mature neutrophils. The present data indicate that ATRA is incapable of inducing complete morphological maturation of APL cells and that secondary-granule deficiency may be a hallmark of aberrantly differentiated leukemic cells.","['Miyauchi, J', 'Ohyashiki, K', 'Inatomi, Y', 'Toyama, K']","['Miyauchi J', 'Ohyashiki K', 'Inatomi Y', 'Toyama K']","[""Clinical Laboratory, National Children's Hospital, Setagayu-ku, Tokyo, Japan.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 1.11.1.7 (Peroxidase)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects/*pathology', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 15', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Inclusion Bodies/drug effects/ultrastructure', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/blood/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutrophils/drug effects/*pathology/ultrastructure', 'Peroxidase/analysis', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Tretinoin/*therapeutic use']",1997/07/15 00:00,1997/07/15 00:01,['1997/07/15 00:00'],"['1997/07/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/07/15 00:01 [medline]', '1997/07/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)58955-6 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1997 Jul 15;90(2):803-13.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Indeed, several studies have suggested that upregulation of various cellular oncogenes and cytokines by Tax may explain the pathogenesis observed in HTLV-I-infected individuals, as well as several Tax-transgenic animal models. We report here the analysis of cytokine expression in a Tax-transgenic animal model with large granular lymphocytic (LGL) leukemia. Two different transgenic mice showed identical expression of interleukin-1alpha (IL-1alpha), IL-1beta, interferon gamma (IFNgamma), and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) in peripheral tail tumors. Interestingly, LGL cell lines derived from these same tumors expressed high levels of both IFNgamma and GM-CSF, which correlated with the level of Tax expression. These same LGL cell lines also expressed high levels of lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1) and intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1). Engraftment of these LGL cell lines into severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice led to the development of leukemia and lymphomas. Examination of these SCID mice showed that their pathology was nearly identical to that observed in the original Tax-transgenic mouse model. Both the Tax-transgenic and engrafted SCID mouse models allow for the analysis of cellular events that are required for tumor development associated with HTLV infection and suggest that Tax expression may be responsible for the upregulation of certain cytokines and adhesion molecules that affect the infiltrating capabilities of HTLV-I-infected cells.","['Grossman, W J', 'Ratner, L']","['Grossman WJ', 'Ratner L']","['Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis, MO 63110, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cytokines/*biosynthesis', 'Gene Products, tax/*biosynthesis', '*Genes, pX', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/biosynthesis', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/biosynthesis', 'Interleukin-1/biosynthesis', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*immunology/pathology', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Models, Biological', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/07/15 00:00,1997/07/15 00:01,['1997/07/15 00:00'],"['1997/07/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/07/15 00:01 [medline]', '1997/07/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)58953-2 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1997 Jul 15;90(2):783-94.,,,"['5T32 HL07088/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA63417/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several lines of evidence suggest that it is this action of EP that regulates erythrocyte production in vivo. To study the control of apoptosis in mouse and human erythroblasts, the expression of members of the Bcl-2 family of proteins and the expression and activation of the apoptosis-linked cysteine protease Yama/CPP32/apopain were examined. These proteins have been implicated as regulators of apoptosis in several cell models. The Bcl-2 family members analyzed were Bcl-2, Bcl-X, Bax, Bad, Bak, A1, and Mcl-1. Bcl-X expression in proerythroblasts was highly EP-dependent. Bcl-X was strongly increased during the terminal differentiation stages of human and mouse erythroblasts, reaching maximum transcript and protein levels at the time of maximum hemoglobin synthesis. This increase in Bcl-X expression led to an apparent level of approximately 50 times the level in proerythroblasts. In contrast, neither mouse nor human erythroblasts expressed Bcl-2 transcript or protein. Bax and Bad proteins remained relatively constant throughout differentiation, but diminished near the time of enucleation. Bak protein was present in early erythroblasts, but diminished progressively during differentiation. EP deprivation in both mouse and human erythroblasts led to activation of the cysteine protease, apopain, as was indicated by cleavage of the proenzyme into its proteolytically active fragments. Apopain activation was detectable within 2 hours of EP deprivation in mouse erythroblasts. These findings suggest an important role for Bcl-X in late erythroid differentiation and for apopain in apoptosis of erythroblasts caused by deprivation of EP.","['Gregoli, P A', 'Bondurant, M C']","['Gregoli PA', 'Bondurant MC']","['Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Bcl2l1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Enzyme Precursors)', '0 (Hemoglobins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Casp3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Caspase 3', '*Caspases', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/*physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/*biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Enzyme Precursors/biosynthesis', 'Erythroblasts/*cytology/drug effects/*physiology', 'Erythropoiesis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Erythropoietin/*pharmacology', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Genes, bcl-2', 'Hemoglobins/biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Multigene Family', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*biosynthesis/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Recombinant Proteins/biosynthesis/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Spleen/cytology/virology', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'bcl-X Protein']",1997/07/15 00:00,1997/07/15 00:01,['1997/07/15 00:00'],"['1997/07/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/07/15 00:01 [medline]', '1997/07/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)58937-4 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1997 Jul 15;90(2):630-40.,,,['5T 32 DK07186/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, we found similar expression of the TPO receptor c-Mpl on the surface of platelets from TAR patients (5 of 5) and a similar molecular weight of the receptor as compared with healthy controls (4 of 4). Platelet response to adenosine diphosphate or thrombin receptor agonist peptide SFLLRN (TRAP) was normal in TAR patients. However, in contrast to results with healthy controls we could show absence of in vitro reactivity of platelets from TAR patients to recombinant TPO as measured by testing TPO synergism to adenine diphosphate and TRAP in platelet activation. TPO induced tyrosine phosphorylation of platelet proteins was completely absent (3 of 4) or markedly decreased (1 of 4).

We conducted a prospective, randomized, controlled study to determine the safety and efficacy of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF; filgrastim) as an adjunct to phase I of induction chemotherapy for adult ALL. Patients (n = 53) were randomized to receive no growth factor or G-CSF (5 microg/kg/d subcutaneously) starting on day 2 of chemotherapy consisting of daunorubicin (45 mg/m2) and vincristine (1.5 mg/m2) on days 1, 8, 15, and 22; L-asparaginase (2500 U/m2) on days 1 through 14; and prednisone (60 mg/m2) on days 1 through 28. A total of 25 patients in the G-CSF group and 26 patients in the control arm fulfilled the inclusion criteria of the study. G-CSF markedly ameliorated neutropenia because the median proportion of days with neutropenia less than 1,000/microL was 29% in the G-CSF group as compared with 84% in the control arm (P < .00005). The median time to reach absolute neutrophil counts (ANC) > or = 1,000/microL was 16 days in G-CSF patients and 26 days in controls (P < .001). More importantly, G-CSF significantly reduced the incidence of febrile neutropenia (12% v 42% in controls, P < .05) and documented infections (40% v 77%, P < .05). No significant differences were found with regard to requirements for red blood cell transfusions and platelet concentrates. A total of 24 of 25 (96%) patients in the G-CSF group and 20 of 25 (80%) evaluable control patients had complete remission after phase I of induction therapy. We conclude that G-CSF can be safely administered as an adjunct to induction therapy of ALL and is clinically beneficial by ameliorating neutropenia and reducing infectious complications.","['Geissler, K', 'Koller, E', 'Hubmann, E', 'Niederwieser, D', 'Hinterberger, W', 'Geissler, D', 'Kyrle, P', 'Knobl, P', 'Pabinger, I', 'Thalhammer, R', 'Schwarzinger, I', 'Mannhalter, C', 'Jaeger, U', 'Heinz, R', 'Linkesch, W', 'Lechner, K']","['Geissler K', 'Koller E', 'Hubmann E', 'Niederwieser D', 'Hinterberger W', 'Geissler D', 'Kyrle P', 'Knobl P', 'Pabinger I', 'Thalhammer R', 'Schwarzinger I', 'Mannhalter C', 'Jaeger U', 'Heinz R', 'Linkesch W', 'Lechner K']","['1st Medical Department, University of Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase III', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/administration & dosage', 'Blood Transfusion', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Erythrocyte Count', 'Female', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutropenia/chemically induced/prevention & control', 'Neutrophils', 'Platelet Count', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Rate', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",1997/07/15 00:00,1997/07/15 00:01,['1997/07/15 00:00'],"['1997/07/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/07/15 00:01 [medline]', '1997/07/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)58932-5 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1997 Jul 15;90(2):590-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For T-cell ALL, 35 of 45 (78%) of newly diagnosed patients' specimens exhibited elevated DHFR relative to DHFR levels in ALL blasts from methotrexate-responsive patients. For 30 of 45 diagnostic T-ALL specimens, DHFR expression was heterogeneous, with up to 3 separate subpopulations covering a 44-fold range; the DHFR-overproducing fractions comprised 10% to 88% of the total blasts. Elevated DHFR was less common in B-precursor ALL at diagnosis, being detected in only 17 of 36 specimens (47%); 11 of these samples exhibited DHFR heterogeneity. Median maximal DHFR levels were fourfold higher in T-cell than B-precursor ALL at diagnosis. Within a particular phenotypic group, there were no correlations between DHFR levels and patient prognostic features, including age, sex, chromosomal abnormalities, white blood cell counts (WBCs), and percentage of S-phase. However, for B-precursor ALL, there was a notably higher fraction of African-American than white patients with elevated DHFR. For patients (both phenotypes) with low WBCs (<50,000/ microL), event-free survival times were significantly shorter for those expressing DHFR above a threshold level than for patients expressing DHFR below this level (P < .016); this relationship was not seen for patients with high WBCs (>50,000/microL). Elevated DHFR was detected in 11 of 14 relapse specimens (5 of 6 T-cell and 6 of 8 B-precursor). Two of five paired relapse specimens (both T-cell) from patients treated with methotrexate exhibited increased DHFR levels over those at diagnosis (2.5- to 5-fold); the fraction of DHFR-overproducing blasts was also increased in 4 of 5 paired relapse specimens (2 B-precursor and 2 T-cell). In contrast to the variations in DHFR, highly impaired methotrexate transport was detected in only 6 of 95 ALL specimens, including both diagnosis and relapse. There was no correlation between phenotype and impaired transport. These data provide further rationale for the use of mechanistically based prognostic factors to complement known biologic or disease-based prognostic indicators in the design of ALL therapy including methotrexate, particularly with patients presenting with low WBCs. The finding of a markedly increased frequency of DHFR overexpression in T-cell over B-precursor ALL suggests that this difference is associated with the poorer prognosis of patients with T-cell ALL treated with standard-dose antimetabolite therapy and implies that higher-dose methotrexate (> or = 1 g/m2) during consolidation therapy may be useful in the treatment of this disease.","['Matherly, L H', 'Taub, J W', 'Wong, S C', 'Simpson, P M', 'Ekizian, R', 'Buck, S', 'Williamson, M', 'Amylon, M', 'Pullen, J', 'Camitta, B', 'Ravindranath, Y']","['Matherly LH', 'Taub JW', 'Wong SC', 'Simpson PM', 'Ekizian R', 'Buck S', 'Williamson M', 'Amylon M', 'Pullen J', 'Camitta B', 'Ravindranath Y']","[""Barbara Ann Karmanos Cancer Institute, the Department of Pharmacology, Wayne State University School of Medicine, the Children's Hospital of Michigan, Detroit 48201, USA.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (ABCG2 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2)', '0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', 'EC 1.5.1.3 (Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2', '*ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters', 'Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Blast Crisis', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/drug therapy/*enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Carrier Proteins/analysis', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Chromosome Aberrations', '*Chromosome Disorders', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/metabolism/therapeutic use', '*Neoplasm Proteins', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Recurrence', 'Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase/biosynthesis/*blood']",1997/07/15 00:00,1997/07/15 00:01,['1997/07/15 00:00'],"['1997/07/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/07/15 00:01 [medline]', '1997/07/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)58931-3 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1997 Jul 15;90(2):578-89.,,,['R01 CA076641/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Associazione Italiana Ematologia Oncologia Pediatrica and the Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster Study Group.,571-7,"The molecular approach for the analysis of leukemia associated chromosomal translocations has led to the identification of prognostic relevant subgroups. In pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), the most common translocations, t(9;22) and t(4;11), have been associated with a poorer clinical outcome. Recently the TEL gene at chromosome 12p13 and the AML1 gene at chromosome 21q22 were found to be involved in the translocation t(12;21)(p13;q22). By conventional cytogenetics, however, this chromosomal abnormality is barely detectable and occurs in less than 0.05% of childhood ALL. To investigate the frequency of the molecular equivalent of the t(12;21), the TEL/AML1 gene fusion, we have undertaken a prospective screening in the running German Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster (BFM) and Italian Associazione Italiana Ematologia Oncologia Pediatrica (AIEOP) multicenter ALL therapy trials. We have analyzed 334 unselected cases of pediatric ALL patients consecutively referred over a period of 5 and 9 months, respectively. The overall incidence of the t(12;21) in pediatric ALL is 18.9%. The 63 cases positive for the TEL/AML1 chimeric products ranged in age between 1 and 12 years, and all but one showed CD10 and pre-B immunophenotype. Interestingly, one case displayed a pre-pre-B immunophenotype. Among the B-lineage subgroup, the t(12;21) occurs in 22.0% of the cases. Fifteen of 61 (24.6%) cases coexpressed at least two myeloid antigens (CD13, CD33, or CDw65) in more than 20% of the gated blast cells. DNA index was available for 59 of the 63 TEL/AML1 positive cases; a hyperdiploid DNA content (> or = 1.16) was detected in only four patients, being nonhyperdiploid in the remaining 55. Based on this prospective analysis, we retrospectively evaluated the impact of TEL/AML1 in prognosis by identifying the subset of B-lineage ALL children enrolled in the closed German ALL-BFM-90 and Italian ALL-AIEOP-91 protocols who had sufficient material for analysis. A total of 342 children were investigated for the presence of TEL/AML1 fusion gene and 99 cases (28.9%) were positive. The patients expressing the TEL/AML1 fusion mRNA appeared to have a better event-free survival (EFS) than the patients who lacked this chimeric product.

We have investigated the effects of the organic arsenical, melarsoprol (a drug used for treatment of trypanosomiasis), upon induction of apoptosis in cell lines representative of chronic B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders. An Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-transformed B-prolymphocytic cell line (JVM-2), an EBV-transformed B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) cell line (I83CLL), and one non-EBV-transformed B-CLL cell line (WSU-CLL) were used as targets. Dose-response experiments with melarsoprol (10(-7) to 10(-9) mol/L) were performed over 96 hours. Unexpectedly, we found that melarsoprol caused a dose- and time-dependent inhibition of survival and growth in all three cell lines. In contrast, As2O3 at similar concentrations had no effect on either viability or growth. After 24 hours, all three cell lines treated with melarsoprol (10(-7) mol/L) exhibited morphologic characteristics of apoptosis. We also observed prominent concentration-dependent downregulation of bcl-2 mRNA after 24 hours of exposure to melarsoprol in WSU-CLL, I83CLL, and JVM-2 cells. Decrease of bcl-2 protein expression was also observed in all three cell lines, whereas As2O3 had no effect on this parameter. We conclude that melarsoprol may inhibit the growth of lymphoid leukemic cell by promoting programmed cell death. Results of these studies suggest that melarsoprol shows promising therapeutic activity in these diseases, and a study to evaluate clinical effects of this drug has been initiated.","['Konig, A', 'Wrazel, L', 'Warrell, R P Jr', 'Rivi, R', 'Pandolfi, P P', 'Jakubowski, A', 'Gabrilove, J L']","['Konig A', 'Wrazel L', 'Warrell RP Jr', 'Rivi R', 'Pandolfi PP', 'Jakubowski A', 'Gabrilove JL']","['Sloan-Kettering Institute, the Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)', 'ZF3786Q2E8 (Melarsoprol)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*toxicity', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', '*Arsenic Poisoning', 'Arsenic Trioxide', '*Arsenicals', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell', 'Melarsoprol/*toxicity', 'Oxides/*toxicity', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/biosynthesis', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Time Factors', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/07/15 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1997/07/15 00:00'],"['1997/07/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1997/07/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)58929-5 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1997 Jul 15;90(2):562-70.,,,,['Blood. 1992 Nov 15;80(10):2690-1.

The absence of efficient B7 family (B7-1/CD80; B7-2/CD86) -mediated costimulation has been shown to be a major defect in tumor cells' capacity to function as antigen-presenting cells. We show here the generation of autologous anti-pre-B-cell leukemia-specific cytolytic T-cell lines from the marrows of 10 of 15 patients with pre-B-cell malignancies. T-cell costimulation via CD28 is an absolute requirement for the generation of these autologous cytolytic T cells (CTL). Although costimulation could be delivered by either bystander B7 transfectants or professional antigen-presenting cells (indirect costimulation), optimal priming and CTL expansion required that the costimulatory signal was expressed by the tumor cell (direct costimulation). These anti-pre-B-cell leukemia-specific CTL lysed both unstimulated and CD40-stimulated tumor cells from each patient studied but did not lyse either K562 or CD40-stimulated allogeneic B cells. Cytolysis was mediated by the induction of tumor cell apoptosis by CD8+ T cells via the perforin-granzyme pathway. Although we were able to generate anti-leukemia-specific CTL from the bone marrow, we were unable to generate such CTL from the peripheral blood of these patients. These studies show that antigen-specific CTL can be generated from the bone marrow of patients with pre-B-cell leukemias and these findings should facilitate the design of adoptive T-cell-mediated immunotherapy trials for the treatment of patients with B-cell precursor malignancies.","['Cardoso, A A', 'Seamon, M J', 'Afonso, H M', 'Ghia, P', 'Boussiotis, V A', 'Freeman, G J', 'Gribben, J G', 'Sallan, S E', 'Nadler, L M']","['Cardoso AA', 'Seamon MJ', 'Afonso HM', 'Ghia P', 'Boussiotis VA', 'Freeman GJ', 'Gribben JG', 'Sallan SE', 'Nadler LM']","[""Department of Medical Oncology, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, and Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (B7-1 Antigen)', '0 (B7-2 Antigen)', '0 (CD86 protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD/biosynthesis/immunology', 'Apoptosis', 'B7-1 Antigen/biosynthesis/immunology', 'B7-2 Antigen', 'Bone Marrow/*immunology/pathology', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*immunology/pathology', 'CHO Cells', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cricetinae', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'Dendritic Cells/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Interferon-gamma/biosynthesis', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*immunology/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Culture Test, Mixed', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/biosynthesis/immunology', 'Preleukemia/*immunology/pathology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Reference Values', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/07/15 00:00,1997/07/15 00:01,['1997/07/15 00:00'],"['1997/07/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/07/15 00:01 [medline]', '1997/07/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)58928-3 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1997 Jul 15;90(2):549-61.,,,"['P01-CA66996-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01-CA68484-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We and others have shown that the gene at 11q23 that is involved in all of these treatment-related leukemias is MLL (also called ALL1, Htrx, and HRX). In general, the translocations in these leukemias are the same as those occurring in de novo leukemia [eg, t(9;11), t(11;19), and t(4;11)], with the treatment-related leukemias accounting for no more than 5% to 10% of any particular translocation type. We have cloned the t(11;16)(q23;p13.3) and have shown that it involves MLL and CBP (CREB binding protein). The CBP gene was recently identified as a partner gene in the t(8;16) that occurs in acute myelomonocytic leukemia (AML-M4) de novo and rarely in treatment-related acute myeloid leukemia. We have studied eight t(11;16) patients, all of whom had prior therapy with drugs targetting topo II with fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using a probe for MLL and a cosmid contig covering the CBP gene. Both probes were split in all eight patients and the two derivative (der) chromosomes were each labeled with both probes. Use of an approximately 100-kb PAC located at the breakpoint of chromosome 16 from one patient revealed some variability in the breakpoint because it was on the der(16) in three patients, on the der(11) in another, and split in four others. We assume that the critical fusion gene is 5'MLL/3'CBP. Our series of patients is unusual because three of them presented with a myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) most similar to chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMMoL) and one other had dyserythropoiesis; MDS is rarely seen in 11q23 translocations either de novo or with t-AML. Using FISH and these same probes to analyze the lineage of bone marrow cells from one patient with CMMoL, we showed that all the mature monocytes contained the fusion genes as did some of the granulocytes and erythroblasts; none of the lymphocytes contained the fusion gene. The function of MLL is not well understood, but many domains could target the MLL protein to particular chromatin complexes. CBP is an adapter protein that is involved in regulating transcription. It is also involved in histone acetylation, which is thought to contribute to an increased level of gene expression. The fusion gene could alter the CBP protein such that it is constitutively active; alternatively, it could modify the chromatin-association functions of MLL.","['Rowley, J D', 'Reshmi, S', 'Sobulo, O', 'Musvee, T', 'Anastasi, J', 'Raimondi, S', 'Schneider, N R', 'Barredo, J C', 'Cantu, E S', 'Schlegelberger, B', 'Behm, F', 'Doggett, N A', 'Borrow, J', 'Zeleznik-Le, N']","['Rowley JD', 'Reshmi S', 'Sobulo O', 'Musvee T', 'Anastasi J', 'Raimondi S', 'Schneider NR', 'Barredo JC', 'Cantu ES', 'Schlegelberger B', 'Behm F', 'Doggett NA', 'Borrow J', 'Zeleznik-Le N']","['Department of Medicine, University of Chicago Medical Center, IL 60637-1470, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (CREB-Binding Protein)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (CREBBP protein, human)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'CREB-Binding Protein', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosome Mapping', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 16', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Female', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia/chemically induced/*drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/chemically induced/*genetics/pathology', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/radiotherapy', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/chemically induced/*genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Topoisomerase II Inhibitors', '*Trans-Activators', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'Zinc Fingers']",1997/07/15 00:00,1997/07/15 00:01,['1997/07/15 00:00'],"['1997/07/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/07/15 00:01 [medline]', '1997/07/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)58926-X [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1997 Jul 15;90(2):535-41.,,,"['CA42557/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA72734/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using double-color fluorescence in situ hybridization (DCFISH) with 2 Ig heavy chain (IgH) gene probes, a yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) clone containing variable region, and a phage clone containing gamma constant region, 14q32.33 translocation was detected as split signals of the IgH gene in 31 patients with plasma cell malignancies and 3 with MGUS. In contrast, of 40 patients who were assessed by G-banding, 3 (7.5%) showed the 14q+ chromosome. DCFISH detected a split of the IgH gene on interphase nuclei in 34 (73.9%) of 46 patients analyzed, whereas on metaphase spreads, it was in 22 (51.2%) of 43 patients analyzed. Interphase DCFISH was particularly useful to detect 14q32.33 translocation in 17 (65.4%) of 26 patients with normal karyotypes.

However, studies dealing with this subject so far, with special emphasis on the sensitivity of the technique in comparison to, for example, Southern blotting have used mixtures of DNA in various concentrations instead of using mixtures of the cells involved, which would reflect the in vivo situation in a more realistic scope. The purpose of this study was therefore to determine the sensitivity and the limitations of the PCR assay by dilution experiments, using mixtures of cells. Furthermore we studied its applicability to cutaneous T-cell proliferative disorders. Two clonal T-cell lines (MyLa and Jurkat) served as positive control. Dilutions of MyLa cells, cultured normal human keratinocytes and peripheral blood mononuclear cells from lymphoma negative volunteers were used to assess the sensitivity of the PCR-DGGE assay. Skin samples from 4 patients with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, 1 lesional lymph node, 2 blood samples from a patient with Sezary syndrome and 4 lymphoma-negative tissue samples were analysed. Two samples were uncertain for diagnosis of lymphoma. The PCR-DGGE assay consisted of a 2-round nested PCR with consensus primers within the TCR-gamma locus followed by electrophoretic separation of the product along a denaturing urea/formamide gradient gel. PCR-DGGE sensitivity was, to our knowledge, for the first time investigated for mixtures of lymphocytes (clonal and polyclonal) and keratinocytes. Clonal T-cells were detected in a concentration between 1-0.1% in keratinocytes, whereas the sensitivity was generally lower upon dilution in peripheral blood mononuclear cells or in a mixture of keratinocytes and peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Nevertheless, T-cell clonality was detected in 2 blood samples of a patient with Sezary syndrome, which were negative by Southern blot analysis. The crucial point of this work was the new approach to establish the sensitivity of the PCR-DGGE, in a way which more closely mimics the condition of clinical specimens. Instead of mixing and amplifying DNA extracted from clonal T-cell lines and polyclonal bone marrow cells, we amplified DNA from clonal and polyclonal cells which had been mixed in various ratios before DNA extraction. Polymerase chain reaction in conjunction with denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis is a sensitive and versatile molecular tool for the assessment of clonality of suspect cutaneous lesions. The determination of sensitivity using DNA extracted from premixed cells more closely corresponds to the actual test situation when testing skin samples.","['Meyer, J C', 'Hassam, S', 'Dummer, R', 'Muletta, S', 'Dobbeling, U', 'Dommann, S N', 'Burg, G']","['Meyer JC', 'Hassam S', 'Dummer R', 'Muletta S', 'Dobbeling U', 'Dommann SN', 'Burg G']","['Department of Dermatology, University Hospital, Zurich, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Denmark,Exp Dermatol,Experimental dermatology,9301549,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta)']",IM,"['Blotting, Southern', 'Clone Cells/chemistry/*pathology', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*analysis/genetics', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel/*methods', 'Gene Rearrangement, beta-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor', 'Humans', 'Keratinocytes/chemistry', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/pathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/chemistry', 'Lymph Nodes/chemistry/pathology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell, Cutaneous/genetics/*pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/chemistry/*pathology', 'Nucleic Acid Denaturation', '*Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/genetics', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta/*genetics', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sezary Syndrome/chemistry/pathology', 'Skin Neoplasms/genetics/*pathology', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/chemistry/*pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/chemistry']",1997/06/01 00:00,1997/06/01 00:01,['1997/06/01 00:00'],"['1997/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1600-0625.1997.tb00158.x [doi]'],ppublish,Exp Dermatol. 1997 Jun;6(3):122-7. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0625.1997.tb00158.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have developed a drug targeting system for the selective delivery of phosphorylated nucleoside analogues to these phagocytosing cells. This system is based on the possibility of encapsulating the phosphorylated drugs into autologous erythrocytes and on the subsequent selective modification of their membranes to promote macrophage recognition and phagocytosis. Targeted delivery of phosphorylated nucleoside analogues to human, feline, and murine macrophages inhibits the infectivity of HIV-1, feline immunodeficiency virus, and LP-BM5 viruses more efficiently than the administration of the corresponding nucleoside analogues. In vivo administration of 2',3'-dideoxycytidine 5'-triphosphate (ddCTP) encapsulated into autologous erythrocytes to LP-BM5-infected mice was found to reduce infectivity and disease progression. Furthermore, the simultaneous administration of AZT or ddC produced additive antiviral effects. The possibility of using red cells as drug targeting systems was useful for the design, synthesis, and delivery of new antiviral nucleoside analogues. As a prototype of these new drugs, di-(thymidine-3'-azido-2',3'-dideoxy-D-riboside)-5'-5'-p1-p2-pyrophospha te (AZTp2AZT) was prepared. Although this drug in solution has the same antiviral activity as AZT, when administered encapsulated into erythrocytes it was several times more efficient in inhibiting the infectivity of human, feline, and murine immunodeficiency viruses. Thus, the availability of a drug targeting system for the selective delivery of antivirals to macrophages offers an additional possibility for the development of new drugs and of new combination antiviral therapies.","['Magnani, M', 'Rossi, L', 'Fraternale, A', 'Casabianca, A', 'Brandi, G', 'Benatti, U', 'De Flora, A']","['Magnani M', 'Rossi L', 'Fraternale A', 'Casabianca A', 'Brandi G', 'Benatti U', 'De Flora A']","['Institute of Biochemistry Giorgio Fornaini, University of Urbino, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Deoxycytosine Nucleotides)', '0 (Dideoxynucleotides)', '0 (Drug Carriers)', '0 (Nucleotides)', '0 (Thymine Nucleotides)', '0 (azidothymidine homodinucleotide)', '4B9XT59T7S (Zidovudine)', ""66004-77-1 (2',3'-dideoxycytidine 5'-triphosphate)""]",IM,"['Animals', 'Antiviral Agents/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Cats', 'Deoxycytosine Nucleotides/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Dideoxynucleotides', 'Drug Carriers', 'Erythrocytes', 'HIV-1/drug effects/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Immunodeficiency Virus, Feline/drug effects/*physiology', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/drug effects/*physiology', 'Macrophages/*physiology/*virology', 'Mice', 'Murine Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/drug therapy', 'Nucleotides/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Thymine Nucleotides', 'Virus Replication/*drug effects', 'Zidovudine/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology']",1997/07/01 00:00,1997/07/01 00:01,['1997/07/01 00:00'],"['1997/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jlb.62.1.133 [doi]'],ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 1997 Jul;62(1):133-7. doi: 10.1002/jlb.62.1.133.,32,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The objective was to define liposomal lipid and drug distribution within sites of tumor growth following intravenous (i.v.) administration to female BDF1 mice bearing either Lewis lung carcinoma, B16/BL6 melanoma, or L1210 ascitic tumors. METHODS: Mice were injected i.v. with EPC/Chol liposomal doxorubicin, and plasma and tumor levels of lipid and drug were determined 1, 4 and 24 h late with radiolabeled lipid and fluorimetry or fluorescence microscopy, respectively. In addition, single-cell suspensions of the Lewis lung and B16/BL6 tumors were prepared and the presence of macrophages was determined with an FITC-labeled rat antimouse CD11b (MAC-1) antibody. RESULTS: For mice bearing the Lewis lung solid tumors, there was a time-dependent accumulation of liposomal lipid, with a plateau of approximately 500 micrograms lipid/g tumor at 48 h. In contrast, the apparent plateau (microgram doxorubicin/g tumor) for doxorubicin was achieved at 1 h and remained constant over a 72-h time course. In comparison with free drug administered at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD, 20 mg/kg) doxorubicin levels in tumors were two- to threefold greater when the drug was administered in liposomal form. The increase in drug delivery was comparable for both solid tumors. With animals bearing the L1210 ascitic tumor, drug exposure was as much as ten times greater (in comparison with free drug) when doxorubicin was administered in liposomes. An evaluation of single-cell suspensions prepared from the two solid tumors suggested that more than 98% of the tumor-associated drug and liposomal lipid was not tumor cell-associated. Histological studies with the Lewis lung carcinoma, however, revealed that a proportion of the drug did colocalize with tumor-associated macrophages. Analysis of cells obtained from mice bearing ascitic tumors showed that more than 80% of the cell-associated drug could be removed by procedures designed to remove adherent cells. CONCLUSION: The results summarized here suggest drug concentrations within a solid tumor, such as the Lewis lung carcinoma, are constant over time when the drug is given in a ""leaky"" EPC/Chol formulation. The results also suggest that liposomal lipid within sites of tumor growth is primarily localized within the interstitial spaces or tumor-associated macrophages.","['Harasym, T O', 'Cullis, P R', 'Bally, M B']","['Harasym TO', 'Cullis PR', 'Bally MB']","['British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Drug Carriers)', '0 (Liposomes)', '0 (Macrophage-1 Antigen)', '0 (Phosphatidylcholines)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '97C5T2UQ7J (Cholesterol)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics', 'Carcinoma, Lewis Lung/*metabolism/pathology', 'Cholesterol', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics', 'Drug Carriers', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Female', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique, Indirect', 'Injections, Intravenous', 'Leukemia L1210/*metabolism/pathology', 'Liposomes', 'Macrophage-1 Antigen/metabolism', 'Melanoma, Experimental/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Phosphatidylcholines', 'Tissue Distribution']",1997/01/01 00:00,1997/01/01 00:01,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s002800050662 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 1997;40(4):309-17. doi: 10.1007/s002800050662.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We tested the hypothesis that splenectomy can be performed with minimal complications in advanced CML, thereby alleviating pain, reversing thrombocytopenia, and minimizing transfusion requirements. METHODS: We reviewed the records of 53 patients in the accelerated or blastic phases of CML who underwent splenectomy between 1970 and 1995 at the U. T. M. D. Anderson Cancer Center. RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients were in accelerated phase and 25 in blastic phase at the time of splenectomy. The most common indications for splenectomy were symptomatic splenomegaly (median splenic weight, 1000 gm; range, 120 to 6700 gm) or thrombocytopenia (platelet count less than 100,000/microliter) or both. There was 1 death within 30 days of splenectomy. The preoperative platelet count increased 3.72-fold +/- 0.53-fold (mean +/- SEM) by postoperative day 7 (p < 0.001; paired t test). Patients with transfusion-dependent thrombocytopenia had significantly fewer platelet and red blood cell transfusions in the 6 months after splenectomy than in the 6 months before splenectomy (p = 0.016; sign test). CONCLUSIONS: Splenectomy can be performed with minimal morbidity and mortality in advanced CML, thereby relieving symptomatic splenomegaly, reversing thrombocytopenia, and minimizing transfusion requirements.","['Bouvet, M', 'Babiera, G V', 'Termuhlen, P M', 'Hester, J P', 'Kantarjian, H M', 'Pollock, R E']","['Bouvet M', 'Babiera GV', 'Termuhlen PM', 'Hester JP', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Pollock RE']","['Department of Surgical Oncology, U.

Both microparasites are feline retroviruses, namely Feline Immunodeficiency Virus (FIV) and Feline Leukaemia Virus (FeLV). The host is the domestic cat Felis catus. The model has been tested with data generated by a long-term study of several natural cat populations. Stability analysis and simulations show that, once introduced in a population, FIV spreads and is maintained, while FeLV can either disappear or persist. Moreover, introduction of both viruses into the population induces an equilibrium state for individuals of each different pathological class. The viruses never induce the extinction of the population. Furthermore, whatever the outcome for the host population (persistence of FIV only, or of both viruses), the global population size at the equilibrium state is only slightly lower than it would have been in the absence of the infections (i.e. at the carrying capacity), indicating a low impact of the viruses on the population. Finally, the impact of the diseases examined simultaneously is higher than the sum of the impact of the two diseases examined separately.

Thus, it is suggested that FISH is a more sensitive method to detect the bcr/abl fusion gene than conventional cytogenetic analysis for the detection of minimal residual disease in CML.","['Tanaka, M', 'Yamazaki, Y', 'Kondo, E', 'Hattori, M', 'Tsushita, K', 'Utsumi, M']","['Tanaka M', 'Yamazaki Y', 'Kondo E', 'Hattori M', 'Tsushita K', 'Utsumi M']","['Department of Clinical Research, Nagoya National Hospital, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Chromosome Mapping', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 22', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/*therapeutic use', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Middle Aged', '*Translocation, Genetic']",1997/05/01 00:00,1997/05/01 00:01,['1997/05/01 00:00'],"['1997/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0145212697001148 [pii]', '10.1016/s0145-2126(97)00114-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1997 May;21(5):465-8. doi: 10.1016/s0145-2126(97)00114-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CGP 41251 reversed the decreased rhodamine 123 uptake in HL-60/VCR cells more efficiently (when compared on a equimolar basis) than staurosporine. However, the protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein unexpectedly modulated the decreased rhodamine 123 uptake in Pgp positive (HL-60/VCR) cells, but not in HL-60/ADR (MRP positive) cells. Cell surface phenotype of both HL-60 drug-resistant cell sublines was compared with that of the parental, drug-sensitive HL-60 cells. Both drug-resistant cell lines expressed markedly decreased levels of cell surface HLA class I antigen in comparison with the parental HL-60 cells. A similar decreased cell surface expression of HLA class II/DR on both drug-resistant, as well as of CD59 (protectin) on HL-60/ADR cells was found. Both protein kinase C inhibitors studied (staurosporine and CGP 41251) exhibited variable effects on cell surface antigen (HLA, ICAM-1, CD59) expression, suggesting complex interactions between PKC-dependent and -independent mechanisms in the regulation of surface antigen expression in these cell lines. Staurosporine differed from CGP 41251 in the cell cycle alterations induced in the HL-60 cell lines examined. Staurosporine induced the accumulation of cells in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle and the appearance of pre-G0 (apoptotic) cells in both examined drug-resistant cell lines. Staurosporine induced the appearance of cells with high DNA content in HL-60/ADR, but not in HL-60/VCR cells.","['Sedlak, J', 'Hunakova, L', 'Sulikova, M', 'Chorvath, B']","['Sedlak J', 'Hunakova L', 'Sulikova M', 'Chorvath B']","['Cancer Research Institute, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Bratislava, Slovakia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CD59 Antigens)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (Isoflavones)', '0 (Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Rhodamines)', '126547-89-5 (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1)', '1N3CZ14C5O (Rhodamine 123)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'DH2M523P0H (Genistein)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)', 'ID912S5VON (midostaurin)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/biosynthesis', 'ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/biosynthesis', 'Antigens, CD/biosynthesis', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Biological Transport/drug effects', 'CD59 Antigens/biosynthesis', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacokinetics', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Genistein', 'HL-60 Cells/cytology/drug effects/*physiology', 'HLA-DR Antigens/biosynthesis', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1/biosynthesis', 'Isoflavones/pharmacology', 'Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis', '*Protein Kinase Inhibitors', 'Rhodamine 123', 'Rhodamines/pharmacokinetics', 'Staurosporine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Vincristine/pharmacokinetics']",1997/05/01 00:00,1997/05/01 00:01,['1997/05/01 00:00'],"['1997/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0145212696000884 [pii]', '10.1016/s0145-2126(96)00088-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1997 May;21(5):449-58. doi: 10.1016/s0145-2126(96)00088-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The NB4 cell line was used as a model for exploring the expression of genes and proteins implicated in growth regulation, differentiation and apoptosis during treatment with RA. NB4 cells undergo a series of cytological and molecular alterations during RA treatment--Day 1: cell differentiation marked by an increase in CD11b is evident. Day 2: WAF1/p21 mRNA and then protein rise, though they drop 2 days later. Day 3: the percentage of cells in S phase begins to decrease and G1 arrest begins. Day 4: p53 mRNA level and then protein levels fall. Day 5: CD11b/BCL-2 double staining cells are markedly reduced. No signs of apoptosis were observed after up to 8 days of treatment with RA. These results demonstrate that NB4 cells treated with RA rapidly differentiate and arrest at G1 phase concurrent with p53-independent WAF1/p21 induction; in addition, phenotypic differentiation appears to commence before changes in cell cycle progression.

As part of an extensive chemotherapy protocol, they had received a total of 293 methotrexate (MTX) infusions in the 6-8 g/m2 dose range. At the termination of the study, when they had all been followed up for 3.5 years or more, 26 of these patients were still in continuous complete remission, whereas 16 had suffered relapse. The intrapatient variability in ClMTX during the eight courses was up to six-fold. In 67% of the patients, the maximum level of ClMTX reached at least twice the minimum value. The coefficients of variation for the intra- and interindividual variability in ClMTX were 9-57% and 26-41%, respectively. The cumulative probability of relapse, estimated by the Kaplan-Meier procedure, was increased for patients with a high ClMTX during the initial treatment course, but the difference was not significant on a 5% level. There was no significant relationship between high individual median ClMTX and subsequent relapse of ALL. However, ClMTX during the initial infusion, the time-dependent mean for ClMTX, and the individual patient's median ClMTX, were significant predictors for event-free survival in a Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. The present study demonstrates gross pharmacokinetic variability and unpredictable values of ClMTX in subsequent courses after standardized administration of MTX to paediatric patients with ALL. In spite of the association between ClMTX and prognosis shown by some of the analyses, estimates of ClMTX rates may not necessarily be related to disease outcome in a way that can be exploited to the benefit of the individual patient.","['Seidel, H', 'Nygaard, R', 'Moe, P J', 'Jacobsen, G', 'Lindqvist, B', 'Slordal, L']","['Seidel H', 'Nygaard R', 'Moe PJ', 'Jacobsen G', 'Lindqvist B', 'Slordal L']","['Department of Paediatrics, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Metabolic Clearance Rate', 'Methotrexate/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Pilot Projects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/*drug therapy', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Probability', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Risk Assessment']",1997/05/01 00:00,1997/05/01 00:01,['1997/05/01 00:00'],"['1997/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0145212696001270 [pii]', '10.1016/s0145-2126(96)00127-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1997 May;21(5):429-34. doi: 10.1016/s0145-2126(96)00127-0.,,,,['Leuk Res. 1997 May;21(5):435-7.

Protein kinase C (PKC) isozymes are widely regarded as being important in signal transduction pathways. We have shown that one isozyme, PKC beta, is uniquely important in mediating phorbol ester-induced growth-arrest in the HL-60 myeloid cell line. 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 induces differentiation and growth-arrest in many cells. It upregulates the expression of PKC beta, potentiating the action of phorbol ester. We tested the hypotheses that cytokines, which arrest the growth of hematopoietic cells, do so by activating PKC beta, and that differentiation and growth-arrest induced by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 is caused by upregulation of PKC beta isozyme gene expression. The influence on growth of combinations of five cytokines (TNF alpha, TGF beta 1, gamma-IFN, IL-1, and G-CSF) and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 on ten human leukemia cell lines (THP-1, HL-60 S, HL-60 PET, U937, K562, Jurkat, MOLT-4, RPM1 8402, KG-1, and KG-1a) was determined. Four cell lines (THP-1, HL-60 S and PET, and U937) exhibited total growth-arrest when incubated with 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 followed by TGF beta 1. The expression by each cell line of mRNA encoding PKC alpha, beta, and delta, both before and after 24 or 48 h of incubation with 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, was determined. Cell lines sensitive to TGF beta 1 each expressed PKC delta endogenously, or expression was up-regulated with 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. U937 cells underexpressed PKC alpha, and HL-60 PET cells underexpressed PKC beta. These data suggested that PKC delta could be responsible for mediating growth-arrest by TGF beta 1. To test this hypothesis directly, we incubated the cells with two bisindolylmaleimide PKC inhibitors during the addition of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 and TGF beta 1. Surprisingly, the PKC inhibitors did not block the growth-arrest induced by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 and TGF beta 1. This experiment strongly suggests that neither growth-arrest induced by TGF beta 1 nor the potentiation of this growth-arrest by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 is mediated by a PKC isozyme which is inhibitable by the bisindolymaleimides.","['Manzel, L', 'Macfarlane, D E']","['Manzel L', 'Macfarlane DE']","[""Department of Medicine, Veteran's Administration Medical Center, Iowa City, IA, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Maleimides)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (PRKCA protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (PRKCD protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C beta)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C-alpha)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C-delta)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)', 'MBK3OO5K8T (bisindolylmaleimide)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Calcitriol/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/*drug effects', 'Cytokines/*pharmacology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Indoles/pharmacology', 'Isoenzymes/biosynthesis', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Maleimides/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase C/*biosynthesis', 'Protein Kinase C beta', 'Protein Kinase C-alpha', 'Protein Kinase C-delta', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/05/01 00:00,1997/05/01 00:01,['1997/05/01 00:00'],"['1997/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0145212696000963 [pii]', '10.1016/s0145-2126(96)00096-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1997 May;21(5):403-10. doi: 10.1016/s0145-2126(96)00096-3.,,,,['Leuk Res. 1997 May;21(5):411-4.

In this report, we investigated the role of c-fyn protein, a src-related protein tyrosine kinase (PTK), during bryo1-induced monocytic differentiation in a human leukemia cell line, THP-1. Bryo1 treatment for 24 h inhibited the proliferation of THP-1 cells and caused a major fraction of them to become adherent cells with distinct monocyte/macrophage features and enhanced expression of M-CSF receptors (M-CSFR), a hallmark of mature macrophages. The THP-1 cells in control cultures expressed low but detectable levels of c-fyn proteins. Treatment of THP-1 cells with bryo1 resulted in an enhanced expression of c-fyn proteins, but not c-lyn proteins, another member of the src-family of kinases. The bryo1 treatment also enhanced the levels of both c-fyn tyrosine kinase and autophosphorylation activities in THP-1 cells. Using a combined immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analysis, bryo1 was shown to promote an enhanced association between c-fyn kinase and M-CSFR. The inducing activity of bryo1 was associated with PKC activation; treatment of THP-1 cells with bryo1 led to a rapid and transient elevation of total PKC activity in THP-1 cells. These results show that enhanced expression and activation of fyn kinases are critical events associated with monocytic differentiation induced by bryo1 in THP-1 cells. Our findings may be of clinical relevance, as bryo1 has been used in clinical trials of cancer patients.","['Li, Y', 'Mohammad, R M', 'al-Katib, A', 'Varterasian, M L', 'Chen, B']","['Li Y', 'Mohammad RM', 'al-Katib A', 'Varterasian ML', 'Chen B']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, MI 48201, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Bryostatins)', '0 (Lactones)', '0 (Macrolides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '37O2X55Y9E (bryostatin 1)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (FYN protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fyn)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Biomarkers', 'Bryostatins', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Lactones/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute', 'Macrolides', 'Macrophages/cytology', 'Monocytes/*cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase C/biosynthesis', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*biosynthesis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fyn', 'Receptor, Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*biosynthesis', 'Recombinant Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Up-Regulation']",1997/05/01 00:00,1997/05/01 00:01,['1997/05/01 00:00'],"['1997/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0145212696000781 [pii]', '10.1016/s0145-2126(96)00078-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1997 May;21(5):391-7. doi: 10.1016/s0145-2126(96)00078-1.,,,['CA 73212/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['Leuk Res. 1997 May;21(5):399-401.

The leukemic cells grow rapidly and progressively in the syngeneic host invading spleen, lymph nodes and liver. A cell line (LBC) was developed from the original tumor. Both the original tumor and the cell line have been characterized as expressing the Thy 1+, CD3-, CD25+, MHC class I+, class II-, CD4- (original tumor), CD4+ (cell line), CD8+, gp70-, J11d.2+ phenotypes. Immunization of syngeneic mice with irradiated LBC cells induced cytotoxic T lymphocytes as well as anti-LBC antibodies which reacted with components of 14, 16 and 27 kDa present on LB tumor cells, LBC cell line and normal thymocytes but not on normal lymph node cells. Immunization of syngeneic mice with LBC cells partially protected them against subsequent challenge with the original tumor cells. The effect of sera from tumor-bearing mice and the super-natants from short term cultures were studied on cell proliferation. An inhibitory activity was demonstrated in these fluids, which was abrogated by addition of exogenous IL-2. ELISA showed the presence of soluble IL-2R alpha chain both in the conditioned medium as well as in the serum, which was demonstrated to be responsible for the inhibitory activity. The soluble IL-2R was produced by LB leukemic cells and exerted the inhibitory activity blocking cell proliferation and modulating immune response by binding to free IL-2. Using reverse-transcription PCR, mRNA for IL-2 was found to be present in tumor cells. Our findings indicate that LB cell proliferation is mediated by an autocrine pathway involving endogenous IL-2 generation, despite the fact that these cells are not dependent on exogenous IL-2 to grow in culture. The relationship between tumorigenicity and expression of MHC class II was also investigated. In vitro treatment with IFN-gamma failed to induce the expression of class II antigens in LBC cell line. Therefore these cells were tri-transfected by a liposome-mediated protocol with 1-A alpha d, I-A beta d genes and pSV2neo. Cells were selected to grow in medium containing Genetecin (G418) and surviving transfectants were cloned. Three I-A+ clones were obtained (LBCT) and were used to induce a specific CTL response against tumor cells. Syngeneic mice inoculated with 10(3) LBCT cells failed to develop a tumor while the DT50 of mice injected with 10(6) LBCT cells was three times the value for mice injected with LBC cells (I-A-). It is suggested that neoexpression of MHC class II molecules enhances anti-tumor response by transforming tumor cells into professional antigen-presenting cells, which may be used to improve tumor-specific immunity in the autologous host.","['Hajos, S E', 'Mongini, C', 'Waldner, C', 'Sanchez Lockhart, M', 'Gravisaco, M J', 'Roig, I', 'Fernandez, T', 'Alvarez, E']","['Hajos SE', 'Mongini C', 'Waldner C', 'Sanchez Lockhart M', 'Gravisaco MJ', 'Roig I', 'Fernandez T', 'Alvarez E']","['Catedra de Inmunologia, Facultad de Farmacia y Bioquimica, Universidad de Buenos Aires, Argentina.']",['spa'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Argentina,Medicina (B Aires),Medicina,0204271,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Leukemia/*immunology/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'T-Lymphocytes']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Medicina (B Aires). 1996;56 Suppl 1:45-56.,,,,,,Caracterizacion inmunobiologica de la leucemia murina LB y la linea celular LBC.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Pre-incubation of cells with mAb AA4 blocks immunoglobulin E (IgE) mediated histamine release. In the present study we investigated the effect of incubation with mAb AA4 on signal transduction events. In addition to stimulation of the high affinity IgE receptor (Fc epsilonRI), cells were also activated by the calcium ionophore A23187 and the acetylcholine agonist carbachol in RBL-2H3 cells transfected with the G protein-coupled m3 muscarinic receptor. Incubation of cells with mAb AA4 in a dose-dependent manner inhibited the following Fc epsilonRI-induced signal transduction events: the increase of intracellular free calcium, phosphoinositol breakdown, tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins including the beta- of Fc epsilonRI and secretion. However, there was no inhibition of degranulation or of these biochemical events when cells were stimulated with calcium ionophore or activated via a G protein-coupled pathway. Our results demonstrate that mAb AA4 selectively blocks Fc epsilonRI-induced cell activation at a very early step upstream of receptor tyrosine phosphorylation. As mAb AA4 has previously been found to bind to gangliosides associated with Fc epsilonRI, inhibition of very early biochemical events may be due to interaction of mAb AA4 with the Fc epsilonRI induced signal transduction cascade at the receptor level.","['Stephan, V', 'Seibt, A', 'Dukanovic, D', 'Skasa, M', 'Swaim, W D', 'Berenstein, E H', 'Siraganian, R P', 'Wahn, V']","['Stephan V', 'Seibt A', 'Dukanovic D', 'Skasa M', 'Swaim WD', 'Berenstein EH', 'Siraganian RP', 'Wahn V']","[""University Children's Hospital, Dusseldorf, Germany.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Mol Immunol,Molecular immunology,7905289,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Gangliosides)', '0 (Phosphatidylinositols)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '21820-51-9 (Phosphotyrosine)', '333DO1RDJY (Serotonin)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism', 'Gangliosides/*physiology', 'Immunoglobulin E/*immunology', 'Mast Cells/*physiology', 'Phosphatidylinositols/metabolism', 'Phosphoproteins/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Phosphotyrosine/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Receptors, IgE/*physiology', 'Serotonin/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/02/01 00:00,1997/02/01 00:01,['1997/02/01 00:00'],"['1997/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0161589097000266 [pii]', '10.1016/s0161-5890(97)00026-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Immunol. 1997 Feb;34(3):227-35. doi: 10.1016/s0161-5890(97)00026-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We identified a significantly lower cellular accumulation of MTXPGs in T-lineage versus B-lineage lymphoblasts in children with ALL, which is consistent with the worse prognosis of T-lineage ALL when treated with conventional antimetabolite-based therapy. Maximum MTXPG accumulation in leukemic blasts in vivo was 3-fold greater in lymphoblasts of children with B-lineage ALL (129 children) compared with those with T-lineage ALL (20 children) (p < 0.01) and was characterized by a saturable (Emax) model in both groups. The human leukemia cell lines NALM6 (B-lineage) and CCRF/CEM (T-lineage) were used to assess potential mechanisms for these lineage differences in MTX accumulation, revealing i) greater total and long-chain MTXPG accumulation in NALM6 over a wide range of methotrexate concentrations (0.2-100 microM), ii) saturation of MTXPG accumulation in both cell lines, with a higher maximum (Emax in NALM6, iii) 3-fold higher constitutive FPGS mRNA expression and enzyme activity in NALM6 cells, iv) 2-fold lower levels of DHFR mRNA and protein in NALM6 cells, and v) 4-6 fold lower extracellular MTX concentration and 2-fold lower intracellular MTXPG concentration to produce equivalent cytotoxicity (LC50) in NALM6 versus CEM. There was a significant relationship between FPGS mRNA and enzyme activity in lymphoblasts from children with newly diagnosed ALL, and blast FPGS mRNA and activity increased after methotrexate treatment. These data indicate higher FPGS and lower DHFR levels as potential mechanisms contributing to greater MTXPG accumulation and cytotoxicity in B-lineage lymphoblasts.","['Galpin, A J', 'Schuetz, J D', 'Masson, E', 'Yanishevski, Y', 'Synold, T W', 'Barredo, J C', 'Pui, C H', 'Relling, M V', 'Evans, W E']","['Galpin AJ', 'Schuetz JD', 'Masson E', 'Yanishevski Y', 'Synold TW', 'Barredo JC', 'Pui CH', 'Relling MV', 'Evans WE']","[""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, College of Pharmacy, University of Tennessee, Memphis 38101, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '25513-46-6 (Polyglutamic Acid)', '82334-40-5 (methotrexate polyglutamate)', 'EC 1.5.1.3 (Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 6.3.2.- (Peptide Synthases)', 'EC 6.3.2.17 (folylpolyglutamate synthetase)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*metabolism', 'Base Sequence', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/drug therapy/*enzymology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/drug therapy/*enzymology', 'Methotrexate/*analogs & derivatives/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Peptide Synthases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Polyglutamic Acid/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/07/01 00:00,1997/07/01 00:01,['1997/07/01 00:00'],"['1997/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1124/mol.52.1.155 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 1997 Jul;52(1):155-63. doi: 10.1124/mol.52.1.155.,,,"['CA20180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37-CA36401/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,"['GENBANK/M11176', 'GENBANK/M98045']",,,,,,,,,,,,

The VD3 analog study demonstrated either effect of VD3 on MEL cells via vitamin D receptor (VDR), as evidenced from the close relationship with the reported affinities for VDR. The effects of 1alpha,25-(OH)2D3 were preceded by the suppression of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) activity, a rate-limiting enzyme in polyamine metabolism. Difluoromethylornithine (DFMO), an inhibitor of ODC, inhibited MEL cell proliferation, which was reversed by the simultaneous addition of putrescine, a product of ODC, but did not affect differentiation. 1alpha,25-(OH)2D3 inhibited cell differentiation during the phenotype-expression stage as reflected by the inhibition of beta-globin gene expression, while it inhibited proliferation in the commitment stage. Furthermore, it seems unlikely that the different effects of VD3 on proliferation and differentiation may be a result of upregulation of VDR or nongenomic action. In summary, it was suggested that 1alpha,25-(OH)2D3 inhibited Activin A-induced MEL cell proliferation and differentiation by distinct mechanisms and inhibited the proliferation by inhibiting ODC activity. We demonstrated the presence of 1alpha,25-(OH)2D3 action on leukemic cells at physiological concentration, which was distinct from the pharmacological effect of VD3 reported thus far.","['Nagasaki, T', 'Hino, M', 'Inaba, M', 'Nishizawa, Y', 'Morii, H', 'Otani, S']","['Nagasaki T', 'Hino M', 'Inaba M', 'Nishizawa Y', 'Morii H', 'Otani S']","['Second Department of Biochemistry, Osaka City University Medical School, Abeno-ku, Osaka, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Arch Biochem Biophys,Archives of biochemistry and biophysics,0372430,"['0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Ornithine Decarboxylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Polyamines)', '0 (Receptors, Calcitriol)', '104625-48-1 (Activins)', '1C6V77QF41 (Cholecalciferol)', '57285-09-3 (Inhibins)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', 'EC 2.3.1.- (Acetyltransferases)', 'EC 2.3.1.57 (diamine N-acetyltransferase)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 4.1.1.17 (Ornithine Decarboxylase)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)', 'ZQN1G5V6SR (Eflornithine)']",IM,"['Acetyltransferases/metabolism', 'Activins', 'Animals', 'Calcitriol/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cholecalciferol/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Eflornithine/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Globins/biosynthesis', 'Growth Substances/pharmacology', 'Inhibins/antagonists & inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Ornithine Decarboxylase/*metabolism', 'Ornithine Decarboxylase Inhibitors', 'Polyamines/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/biosynthesis', 'Receptors, Calcitriol/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/07/15 00:00,1997/07/15 00:01,['1997/07/15 00:00'],"['1997/07/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/07/15 00:01 [medline]', '1997/07/15 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0003-9861(97)90152-1 [pii]', '10.1006/abbi.1997.0152 [doi]']",ppublish,Arch Biochem Biophys. 1997 Jul 15;343(2):181-7. doi: 10.1006/abbi.1997.0152.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the case of L6 BCR-ABL fusion mRNA (b2a2 type; BCR exon 2 is fused to ABL exon 2), which has no effective cleavage sites for conventional hammerhead ribozymes near the BCR-ABL junction, it has proved very difficult to cleave the chimeric mRNA specifically. Several hammerhead ribozymes with relatively long junction-recognition sequences have poor substrate-specificity. Therefore, we explored the possibility of using newly selected DNA enzymes that can cleave RNA molecules with high activity to cleave L6 BCR-ABL fusion (b2a2) mRNA. In contrast to the results with the conventional ribozymes, the newly designed DNA enzymes, having higher flexibility for selection of cleavage sites, were able to cleave this chimeric RNA molecule specifically at sites close to the junction. Cleavage occurred only within the abnormal BCR-ABL mRNA, without any cleavage of the normal ABL or BCR mRNA. Thus, these chemically synthesized DNA enzymes seem to be potentially useful for application in vivo , especially for the treatment of CML, if we can develop exogenous delivery strategies.","['Kuwabara, T', 'Warashina, M', 'Tanabe, T', 'Tani, K', 'Asano, S', 'Taira, K']","['Kuwabara T', 'Warashina M', 'Tanabe T', 'Tani K', 'Asano S', 'Taira K']","['National Institute for Advanced Interdisciplinary Research, 1-1 Higashi, Tsukuba Science City 305, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Nucleic Acids Res,Nucleic acids research,0411011,"['0 (RNA, Catalytic)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Catalysis', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Genetic Therapy', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/therapy', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nucleic Acid Conformation', 'RNA, Catalytic/chemistry/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/*metabolism', 'Substrate Specificity']",1997/08/01 00:00,1997/08/01 00:01,['1997/08/01 00:00'],"['1997/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['gka494 [pii]', '10.1093/nar/25.15.3074 [doi]']",ppublish,Nucleic Acids Res. 1997 Aug 1;25(15):3074-81. doi: 10.1093/nar/25.15.3074.,,,,,PMC146844,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Over a 4-year interval, sera from these animals continued to exhibit a peculiar Western blot (WB) pattern resembling an HTLV-2 pattern (p24gag reactivity of equal or greater intensity than that of p19gag and a strong reactivity to recombinant gp21) but also exhibiting, in five of six cases, a reactivity against MTA-1, an HTLV-1 gp46 peptide. PCR experiments on DNA extracted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells using HTLV-1- or HTLV-2-specific long terminal repeat, gag, pol, env, and tax primers yielded negative results. However, highly conserved primers successfully amplified three different gene segments of env, tax, and env-tax. The results of comparative sequence analysis demonstrated that STLV-1marc1 was not closely related to any known STLV-1 strain, was the most divergent strain of the HTLV-1-STLV-1 group, and lacked the ATG initiation codons corresponding to the p12 and p13 proteins of HTLV-1. Phylogenetic analyses incorporating representative strains of all known HTLV-STLV clades consistently depicted STLV-1marc1 within the HTLV-1-STLV-1 type 1 lineage, but it probably diverged early, since its position is clearly different from all known viral strains of this group and it had a bootstrap resampling value of 100%. Genetic distance estimates between STLV-1marc1 and all other type 1 viruses were of the same order of magnitude as those between STLV-2PanP and all other type 2 viruses. In light of the recent demonstration of interspecies transmission of some STLV-1 strains, our results suggest the existence in Asia of HTLV-1 strains related to this new divergent STLV-1marc1 strain, which may be derived from a common ancestor early in the evolution of the type 1 viruses and could be therefore considered a prototype of a new HTLV-STLV clade.","['Mahieux, R', 'Pecon-Slattery, J', 'Gessain, A']","['Mahieux R', 'Pecon-Slattery J', 'Gessain A']","['Departement des Retrovirus, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,,IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/classification/genetics', 'Macaca/*virology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phylogeny', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Simian T-lymphotropic virus 1/*classification/genetics']",1997/08/01 00:00,1997/08/01 00:01,['1997/08/01 00:00'],"['1997/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.71.8.6253-6258.1997 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1997 Aug;71(8):6253-8. doi: 10.1128/JVI.71.8.6253-6258.1997.,,,,,PMC191894,,"['GENBANK/U76624', 'GENBANK/U76625', 'GENBANK/U76626']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Two of these antibodies also bound to viable HTLV-2 infected cells and immunoprecipitated HTLV-2 gp46. Virus neutralization was determined by syncytium inhibition assays. Eight monoclonal antibodies, including all seven that recognized denaturation-sensitive epitopes within HTLV-1 gp46, possessed significant virus neutralization activity. By competitive inhibition analysis it was determined that these antibodies recognized at least four distinct conformational epitopes within HTLV-1 gp46. These findings indicate the importance of conformational epitopes within HTLV-1 gp46 in mediating a neutralizing antibody response to HTLV infection.","['Hadlock, K G', 'Rowe, J', 'Perkins, S', 'Bradshaw, P', 'Song, G Y', 'Cheng, C', 'Yang, J', 'Gascon, R', 'Halmos, J', 'Rehman, S M', 'McGrath, M S', 'Foung, S K']","['Hadlock KG', 'Rowe J', 'Perkins S', 'Bradshaw P', 'Song GY', 'Cheng C', 'Yang J', 'Gascon R', 'Halmos J', 'Rehman SM', 'McGrath MS', 'Foung SK']","['Department of Pathology, Stanford University School of Medicine, California 94305, USA. k.g.hadlock@forsythe.stanford.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '0 (env Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus)', '0 (gp46 protein, Human T-cell leukemia virus type I)', '0 (gp46 protein, Human immunodeficiency virus 2)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line', '*Epitope Mapping', 'Gene Products, env/*immunology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*immunology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 2/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Neutralization Tests', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Protein Conformation', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/*immunology', 'env Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus']",1997/08/01 00:00,1997/08/01 00:01,['1997/08/01 00:00'],"['1997/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.71.8.5828-5840.1997 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1997 Aug;71(8):5828-40. doi: 10.1128/JVI.71.8.5828-5840.1997.,,,"['DA60596/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States', 'HL33811/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC191838,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We and others have found that when perforin is purified, its lytic activity is markedly reduced. ELISAs indicated that our final recovery of perforin protein was excellent. We decided to determine if depletion of other granule proteins contributed to the loss of lytic activity. We isolated perforin to the point where lytic activity was diminished and added back granule proteins that had no lytic activity or detectable (antigenic) perforin. Perforin was isolated by Cu2+-immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) followed by phenyl-Superose hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC). Its lytic activity was enhanced by a low molecular weight (<15 kD) protein, perforin enhancing protein (PEPr). We have isolated PEPr by two methods, HIC and MonoQ. Nonlytic PEPr restored perforin to close to its original lytic activity. A protein similar if not identical to PEPr was also detectable as an 125I-labeled protein associated with lytic perforin. We propose that PEPr acts in conjunction with perforin to form lethal pores and suggest that PEPr may be the rat equivalent of the human cytotoxic lymphocyte protein, granulysin.","['Winkler, U', 'Fraser, S A', 'Hudig, D']","['Winkler U', 'Fraser SA', 'Hudig D']","['Department of Microbiology, School of Medicine, University of Nevada, Reno 89557, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Pore Forming Cytotoxic Proteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '126465-35-8 (Perforin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cytoplasmic Granules/*metabolism', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*metabolism/pathology/ultrastructure', 'Leukemia, Experimental/metabolism/pathology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Molecular Weight', 'Perforin', 'Pore Forming Cytotoxic Proteins', 'Proteins/analysis/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred F344']",1997/07/09 00:00,1997/07/09 00:01,['1997/07/09 00:00'],"['1997/07/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/07/09 00:01 [medline]', '1997/07/09 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-291X(97)96899-6 [pii]', '10.1006/bbrc.1997.6899 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 1997 Jul 9;236(1):34-9. doi: 10.1006/bbrc.1997.6899.,,,"['R01 CA38942/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32CA09563/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has been characterized in adherent cell lines as an inducer of cellular death, hyperploidy (multinucleation), and cytoskeletal reorganization. The molecular mechanism of these actions is unclear. Two cellular mechanisms can be hypothesized to explain the DNA content increase (hyperploidy) induced by the toxin. The first is that the toxin interferes with cytoplasmic division without interfering with normal nuclear cycling, such that DNA is replicated in the absence of cell division. The second is that the toxin drives the nuclear machinery to replicate the DNA multiple times within one cell cycle, without interfering with cytoplasmic division. In order to investigate these phenomena, we have constructed a recombinant CNF2 gene that expresses a toxin with both an epitope tag and a polyhistidine tag. Extracts made from E. coli that express this gene have a high multinucleating activity that colocalizes with the recombinant 115-kDa protein. To distinguish between these hypotheses, we used recombinant CNF2 and several growth conditions (time, partial differentiation, and stage of growth) to establish a relationship between cellular divisions and generation of hyperploidy. It was also determined that the toxin had no effect upon in vitro DNA replication using a Xenopus egg extract system. In aggregate, these data are consistent with the hypothesis that CNF2 is affecting cytoplasmic division and thereby removing the requirement for a completed mitosis before the initiation of another S-phase. These data are discussed in relation to the generation of polyploid cells during megakaryopoeisis and the generation of aneuploid cells during tumorigenesis.","['Denko, N', 'Langland, R', 'Barton, M', 'Lieberman, M A']","['Denko N', 'Langland R', 'Barton M', 'Lieberman MA']","['Department of Molecular Genetics, Biochemistry, and Microbiology, University of Cincinnati School of Medicine, Ohio 45267-0524, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (Bacterial Toxins)', '0 (Cytotoxins)', '0 (Escherichia coli Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (cytotoxic necrotizing factor type 2)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells/cytology/drug effects', 'Animals', 'Bacterial Toxins/isolation & purification/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Division/drug effects/physiology', 'Cytotoxins/isolation & purification/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'DNA Replication/*drug effects', '*Escherichia coli Proteins', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Experimental', 'Mice', 'Mitosis/*drug effects/physiology', 'Oocytes/cytology', 'Ploidies', 'Recombinant Proteins/isolation & purification/metabolism/pharmacology', 'S Phase/*drug effects/physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/cytology/drug effects', 'Xenopus laevis']",1997/07/10 00:00,1997/07/10 00:01,['1997/07/10 00:00'],"['1997/07/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/07/10 00:01 [medline]', '1997/07/10 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0014-4827(97)93595-3 [pii]', '10.1006/excr.1997.3595 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 1997 Jul 10;234(1):132-8. doi: 10.1006/excr.1997.3595.,,,['HL51555/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This paper reviews both the genetics of immune resistance and the types of immune responses required for recovery from infection. Specific major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and II alleles are necessary for recovery, as is a non-MHC gene, Rfv-3, which controls virus-specific antibody responses. In concordance with these genetic requirements are immunological requirements for cytotoxic T lymphocyte, T helper, and antibody responses, each of which provides essential nonoverlapping functions. The complexity of responses necessary for recovery from Friend virus infection has implications for both immunotherapies and vaccines. For example, it is shown that successful passive antibody therapy is dependent on MHC type because of the requirement for T cell responses. For vaccines, successful immunization requires priming of both T cell and B cell responses. In vivo depletion experiments demonstrate different requirements for CD8(+) T cells depending on the vaccine used. The implications of these studies for human retroviral diseases are discussed.","['Hasenkrug, K J', 'Chesebro, B']","['Hasenkrug KJ', 'Chesebro B']","['Laboratory of Persistent Viral Diseases, Rocky Mountain Laboratories, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Hamilton, MT 59840, USA.

BoCD4, BoCD8 and three CD4 CD8-T-cell subsets retained their original frequencies after permeabilization in both groups of animals. The recognition of the B-B2 lymphocyte molecule was only partially expressed on the cell surface of intact lymphocytes and was further revealed on permeabilization.

Reactivities of an anti-heat shock protein (Hsp) 70 were measured before and after permeabilization of PBLs. Similar increased cell frequencies were obtained for both groups of bovines.

DESIGN: A number of strategies were deployed to help evoke a picture of home care informatics needs: A detailed questionnaire evaluating informational needs and assessing programmable technologies was distributed to a clinic population of parents of children with cancer. Open ended questionnaires were distributed to medical staff and parents soliciting a list of questions asked of medical staff. Parent procedure training was observed to evaluate the training dialog, and parents were observed interacting with a prototype information and education computer offering. RESULTS: Parents' concerns ranged from the details of managing day to day, to conceptual information about disease and treatment, to management of psychosocial problems. They sought information to solve problems and to provide emotional support, which may create conflicts of interest when the material is threatening. Whether they preferred to be informed by a doctor, nurse, or another parent depended on the nature of the information. Live interaction was preferred to video, which was preferred to text for all topics. Respondents used existing technologies in a straightforward way but were enthusiastic about the proposed use of computer technology to support home care. Multimedia solutions appear to complement user needs and preferences. CONCLUSION: Consumers appear positively disposed toward on-line solutions. On-line systems can offer breadth, depth and timeliness currently unattainable. Patients should be involved in the formation and development process in much the same way that users are involved in user-centered computer interface design.

KAR-2 (3""-(beta-chloroethyl)-2"",4""-dioxo-3,5""-spiro-oxazolidino- 4-deacetoxy-vinblastine), is a bis-indol derivative; catharantine is coupled with the vindoline moiety which contains a substituted oxazolidino group. Our binding studies showed that KAR-2 exhibited high affinity for bovine purified brain tubulin (Kd-3 microM) and it inhibited microtubule assembly at a concentration of 10 nM. 2. Anti-microtubular activity of KAR-2 was highly dependent on the ultrastructure of microtubules: while the single tubules were sensitive, the tubules cross-linked by phosphofructokinase (ATP: D-fructose-6-phosphate-1-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.11) exhibited significant resistance against KAR-2. 3. The cytoplasmic microtubules of Chinese hamster ovary mammalian and Sf9 insect cells were damaged by 1 microgram ml-1 KAR-2, as observed by indirect immunofluorescence and transmission electron microscopy. Scanning electron microscopy revealed intensive surface blebbing on both types of cells in the presence of KAR-2. 4.

For example, one characteristic function of the retroviruses, which is generally not found in eukaryotic cells, is the production of an RNA:DNA hybrid in the viral replication phase. If an agent is designed to bind only to an RNA:DNA hybrid, and not to DNA or to RNA, such an agent might be able to inhibit specifically the RNase H activity of retroviral reverse transcriptase, and therefore suppress viral replication. Actinomycin D is known to bind to double-stranded DNA, but not to RNA, because steric hindrance between the 2-amino group of the phenoxazone ring and the 2'-hydroxyl group of RNA prevents intercalation of the compound. However, if the > C-H moiety at the 8-position of the phenoxazone ring is replaced by a > C-F, a possible hydrogen-bond acceptor, this analogue (8-fluoro-actinomycin D, F8AMD) might be able to bind intercalatively to an RNA:DNA hybrid by forming an additional hydrogen bond between F8 and the 2'-hydroxyl group of the guanosine ribose. To test this hypothesis, the crystal structure of d(GAAGCTTC)2-F8AMD has been determined at 3.0 A resolution. Based on this crystal structure, a model in which F8AMD binds into the hybrid r(GAAGCUUC):d(GAAGCTTC) has been built using molecular mechanics and dynamic methods. These structural studies indicate that F8AMD binds intercalatively to a B-form double-stranded DNA whereas the drug intercalates into an RNA:DNA hybrid taking an A-form conformation. In the RNA:DNA hybrid complex, the F8 atom is located so as to be able to interact to an O2' hydroxyl group with either an O-H...F hydrogen bond or H+...F- electrostatic interaction. This interaction might stabilize the F8AMD molecule in the RNA:DNA hybrid. A binding study indicates that both actinomycin D (AMD) and F8AMD bind intercalatively not only to double-stranded DNAs, but also to RNA:DNA hybrids. Although the overall binding capacity of F8AMD (k = 4.5 x 10(5) M-1) is reduced slightly in comparison with AMD itself (k = 1.8 x 10(6) M-1), F8AMD tends to bind relatively more favorably than AMD to the RNA:DNA hybrids. The drugs' effects on RNA synthesis in HeLa cells indicates that the binding capacities of AMD and F8AMD correlates strongly to their RNA synthesis inhibitory activities. F8AMD required a concentration of 78 nM to inhibit RNA polymerase activity in HeLa cells by 50%, whereas AMD reached the same inhibitory level at 30 nM. Surprisingly, F8AMD exhibits unique selectivity against leukemia cells as does another C8-derivatized AMD analogue, N8AMD. F8AMD inhibits 50% of leukemia cell growth at less than 1.0 nM whereas 10- to 130-fold-higher drug concentrations are required to inhibit the growth of other tumor cell lines by 50%. The GI50 value of F8AMD for leukemia cells is the lowest among the GI50 values for all other AMD derivatives tested. By contrast, AMD is quite potent and kills most cells at less than 50 nM concentration, but it does not show any selectivity for certain cell lines. This indicates that AMD should have very limited use as an antitumor agent. It is difficult to rationalize why F8AMD and N8AMD show such strong selectivity against leukemia cells. However, this study and our previous study (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994, 116, 7971) indicated that F8AMD and N8AMD tended to bind more favorably to RNA:DNA hybrids. Thus, the unique antileukemia selectivity shown by F8AMD and N8AMD might be used by the agents binding to RNA:DNA hybrids rather than to double-stranded DNA.","['Takusagawa, F', 'Takusagawa, K T', 'Carlson, R G', 'Weaver, R F']","['Takusagawa F', 'Takusagawa KT', 'Carlson RG', 'Weaver RF']","['Department of Biochemistry, University of Kansas, Lawrence 66045-2106, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Bioorg Med Chem,Bioorganic & medicinal chemistry,9413298,"['0 (8-fluoro-actinomycin D)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Nucleic Acid Heteroduplexes)', '1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.7.6 (DNA-Directed RNA Polymerases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*metabolism/*pharmacology', 'DNA/drug effects/*metabolism', 'DNA-Directed RNA Polymerases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Dactinomycin/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Nucleic Acid Conformation', 'Nucleic Acid Heteroduplexes/drug effects/*metabolism', 'RNA/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/06/01 00:00,1997/06/01 00:01,['1997/06/01 00:00'],"['1997/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S096808969700062X [pii]', '10.1016/s0968-0896(97)00062-x [doi]']",ppublish,Bioorg Med Chem. 1997 Jun;5(6):1197-207. doi: 10.1016/s0968-0896(97)00062-x.,,,['AI28578/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently it has been reported that defective HTLV-1 provirus was detected frequently in the central nervous system (CNS) lesions of HAM/TSP patients. Here we investigated sequence variations of the pX region of HTLV-1 in the CNS and peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) of the same patient. The results analyzing 9-13 clones isolated from each specimen indicated that the pX region is highly variable within a patient with HAM/TSP, and the mutations were found at almost random positions within the sequences analyzed. The frequency and pattern of those mutations did not appear to differ significantly between the CNS and PBL of the same patient, although they differed among patients. Similarly, frequent mutations were observed in an asymptomatic carrier of HTLV-1, although the variability was moderate, suggesting that the high variability of the pX sequence is not a specific event in HAM/TSP. However, one asymptomatic carrier showed much less frequent variations very similarly to an ATL patient; both of them harbored clonally expanded infected cells. Thus the apparent low variability was explained by clonal selection of a single species of the provirus by the clonal proliferation of infected cells. These results clearly indicate that mutations including defectives are not specifically associated with the CNS lesions in HAM/TSP patients, but suggest that the random mutations simply reflect the rate of viral replication in individuals and the variants were not inherited frequently.","['Saito, M', 'Furukawa, Y', 'Kubota, R', 'Usuku, K', 'Sonoda, S', 'Izumo, S', 'Osame, M', 'Yoshida, M']","['Saito M', 'Furukawa Y', 'Kubota R', 'Usuku K', 'Sonoda S', 'Izumo S', 'Osame M', 'Yoshida M']","['Department of Cellular and Molecular Biology, University of Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Neurovirol,Journal of neurovirology,9508123,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Carrier State/virology', 'Central Nervous System/physiopathology/*virology', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Female', 'Genes, Viral/genetics', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Paraparesis, Tropical Spastic/physiopathology/*virology']",1995/09/01 00:00,1995/09/01 00:01,['1995/09/01 00:00'],"['1995/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/13550289509114025 [doi]'],ppublish,J Neurovirol. 1995 Sep;1(3-4):286-94. doi: 10.3109/13550289509114025.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Infectious virus was isolated from the spinal cord on days 3-7 post inoculation (PI). Immunocytochemical labeling of HSV antigen was detected in ipsilateral ventral horn neurons in the spinal cord at day 3 PI and had spread to contiguous spinal cord regions by day 6 PI.

Younger mice appeared to be resistant in spite of this immunosuppresive treatment. The present results confirm that mice as young as 1 month of age possess CNS cells expressing ecotropic MuLV and show that these mice are susceptible to paralytic LDV infection provided their anti-LDV immune responses are blocked for an extended period of time by repeated cyclophosphamide treatments or by a genetic defect. Furthermore, old mice become naturally susceptible to paralytic LDV infection because of an impaired ability to mount a motor neuron protective anti-LDV immune response.","['Anderson, G W', 'Even, C', 'Rowland, R R', 'Palmer, G A', 'Harty, J T', 'Plagemann, P G']","['Anderson GW', 'Even C', 'Rowland RR', 'Palmer GA', 'Harty JT', 'Plagemann PG']","['Department of Microbiology, University of Minnesota Medical School, Minneapolis 55455-0312, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Neurovirol,Journal of neurovirology,9508123,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)']",IM,"['Aging/*immunology/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/blood', 'Arterivirus Infections/*immunology', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Cyclosporine/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Immune System/drug effects/virology', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/pharmacology', 'Lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus/*immunology', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred AKR', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Motor Neuron Disease/genetics/immunology/*virology', 'Poliomyelitis/immunology/virology', 'RNA, Viral/analysis', 'Spinal Cord/virology']",1995/09/01 00:00,1995/09/01 00:01,['1995/09/01 00:00'],"['1995/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/13550289509114020 [doi]'],ppublish,J Neurovirol. 1995 Sep;1(3-4):244-52. doi: 10.3109/13550289509114020.,,,"['AI27320/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 09138/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy is currently estimated to arise in 5% of all human immunodeficiency virus-infected individuals. The clinical features of the disorder in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome do not appear to be significantly different from progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy occurring in association with other immunosuppressive disorders. Radiographically, the appearance of HIV dementia on magnetic resonance imaging is sometimes confused with that of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. Among the characteristics that are helpful in distinguishing between the two disorders are the presence of focal findings, the rate of disease progression, the specific magnetic resonance imaging attributes, including the location of the lesions, and certain cerebrospinal fluid parameters, including surrogate markers for human immunodeficiency virus dementia and the presence of myelin basic protein. The remarkable increase in the burden of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy has provided a vital impetus for its study, particularly with respect to diagnosis and therapy. Establishing an unequivocal diagnosis of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy currently requires brain biopsy. The application of polymerase chain reaction for JC virus amplification to cerebrospinal fluid samples suggests that it may provide an alternative means of diagnosis.

The CBL-LD50 mean values were significantly reduced at all PDN and at the 4 highest DFZ concentrations. However, a dose-response effect was seen only in the DFZ group. Both CLB-DFZ and CLB-PDN interactions were analysed in 16 samples at 25 different dose-combinations, resulting in 400 comparisons between expected and observed leukaemic cell survival (LCS) values for each group. In particular, 45.75% and 40% dose combinations were synergistic in CLB-DFZ and CLB-PDN groups, respectively. A relatively higher number of antagonistic interactions were observed among CLB-PDN dose combinations, while analogous number of additive interactions were detected. At concentrations of CLB x1 microgram/ml the phenomenon of synergism, regardless of the steroid concentration, did occur more frequently. On the other hand, a more elevated number of antagonistic interactions were counted at CLB 100 micrograms/ ml. In conclusion, both DFZ and PDN synergize in vitro with CLB, especially at low concentrations of the alkylating agent.","['Morabito, F', 'Callea, I', 'Irrera, G', 'Cartisano, G', 'Dattola, A', 'Rodino, A', 'Brugiatelli, M']","['Morabito F', 'Callea I', 'Irrera G', 'Cartisano G', 'Dattola A', 'Rodino A', 'Brugiatelli M']","['Hematology-Oncology Department, Azienda Ospedaliera Bianchi-Melacrino-Morelli, Reggio Calabria, Italy. sp00404@relay.it.net']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '0 (Pregnenediones)', '18D0SL7309 (Chlorambucil)', 'KR5YZ6AE4B (deflazacort)', 'X4W7ZR7023 (Methylprednisolone)']",IM,"['Analysis of Variance', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/*therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Chlorambucil/*therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Lethal Dose 50', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Methylprednisolone/*pharmacology', 'Pregnenediones/*pharmacology']",1997/05/01 00:00,1997/05/01 00:01,['1997/05/01 00:00'],"['1997/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1600-0609.1997.tb01675.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 1997 May;58(5):301-6. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.1997.tb01675.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, significant prolongation of the mean survival rates was not elicited by the i.p. post-treatment with AS 15557 alone. When 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) was applied i.p. to mice receiving post-treatment with AS 15557 alone, the mean survival rates of the L1210-leukemia-cell-bearing mice were significantly prolonged.

The method is based on a two-sample t-statistic in which composite test:reference and reference:reference CGH profiles are compared at each point along the genome to detect regions of significant differences. Composite profiles are created by combining CGH profiles measured from several metaphase chromosomes for each type of chromosome in the normal human karyotype. Composites for both test:reference and reference:reference CGH analyses are used to generate mean CGH profiles and information about the variance therein. The utility of the method is demonstrated through analysis of aneusomies and partial gain and loss of DNA sequence in a myeloid leukemia specimen. Banding analyses of this specimen indicated inv (3)(q21q26), del (5)(q2?q35), -7, +8 and add (17)(p11.2). The t-statistic analyses of CGH data indicated rev ish enh (8) and rev ish dim (5q31.1q33.1,7q11.23qter). The undetected gain on 17p was small and confined to a single band (17p11.2).

A charge coupled television camera and a special frame grabber were used for data acquisition, and 247 nucleated cell images were transferred from a microscope to an IBM 386 computer to be processed. One hundred sixty-five and 82 of these images were used for training and testing, respectively. Our system is composed of image processing and analysis (enhancement, thresholding/smoothing, edge detection), pattern recognition (feature extraction and classification with supervised artificial neural network), and expert system development. Image processing and analysis were used to obtain 13 cellular features to be used as the input parameters (neurons) of the artificial neural network. A supervised artificial neural network (back-propagation learning algorithm) was used in the classification of 16 different cells (output neurons of the neural network), which is the second step of pattern recognition. A confusion matrix has been developed to compare the similarities and dissimilarities between the differential recognitions of the hematologist and the expert system.

Three different permeabilization techniques were used [FACS Lysing Solution (FLy), B.Dis; Ortho-PermeaFix (OPF); Fix and Perm (F&P), Caltag] prior to monoclonal antibody (McAb) staining, in order to verify the specificity and the sensitivity of the three labelling methods towards the two model antigens. Peripheral blood cells from 15 healthy subjects and Ortho Absolute Control served as controls. Data were expressed as percentage of positivity, net fluorescence intensity, ratio between mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of positive cells and that of isotypic controls (P/N ratio; evaluated in both geometric and arithmetic scale), and, in 12 representatives cases (7 AML, 5 normal samples), in the form of both molecules of equivalent soluble fluorochromes (MESF) and antibody binding capacities (ABC). As far as the antigenic expression of MPO and lysozyme in normal samples is concerned, F&P resulted, in our hands, in the most specific and sensitive staining, followed by FLy solution and OPF, which showed positivity for MPO, and, to lesser extent, for lysozyme in a considerable manner of lymphocytes (means 64% and 54%, respectively, for OPF and FLy; range of ABC/cell: 0.9-5.2 x 10(3)) obtained from healthy subjects. With the reference F&P permeabilizing solution, 90% and 80% of FAB M1-M5 cases were found to be positive for MPO and lysozyme, respectively. However, M1, M2, and M3 AML FAB (French-American-British) subvarieties were characterized by a brighter expression for MPO (mean ABC/cell: 89 x 10(3)) than that of lysozyme (mean ABC/cell: 12.5 x 10(3D)), whereas blast cells from patients with M5a FAB subtypes showed higher levels of lysozyme (mean ABC/cell: 65 x 10(3)) than that of MPO (mean ABC/cell: 0.1 x 10(3)). One of five cases of FAB MO AML showed a dull positivity for MPO-7 McAb. Patients with ALL were MPO and lysozyme negative using both F&P and FLy reagents, although a certain degree of positivity was documented in some cases with OPF. Taking these data together, it can be stated that the use of anti-MPO McAbs may be of great value for the diagnosis and monitoring of acute leukemia and, along with lysozyme McAb, can provide useful information in the distinction of myeloid from monocytic leukemias and in the lineage assignment of apparently biphenotypic forms. However, the methodology used for the detection of these myeloid-associated antigens is critical for a correct interpretation of cytofluorimetric data and should be taken into account when evaluating data coming from multicenter trials dealing with leukemias. A standardization of cytofluorimetric analysis of intracellular antigens is needed in order to improve the reproducibility and comparability of results in multicenter studies.","['Lanza, F', 'Latorraca, A', 'Moretti, S', 'Castagnari, B', 'Ferrari, L', 'Castoldi, G']","['Lanza F', 'Latorraca A', 'Moretti S', 'Castagnari B', 'Ferrari L', 'Castoldi G']","['Section of Hematology, University of Ferrara, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cytometry,Cytometry,8102328,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Fixatives)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', 'EC 1.11.1.7 (Peroxidase)', 'EC 3.2.1.17 (Muramidase)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Bone Marrow Cells', '*Cell Membrane Permeability', 'Cytoplasmic Granules/*chemistry', 'Evaluation Studies as Topic', 'Fixatives', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping/methods', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*immunology/pathology', 'Leukocytes/cytology', 'Muramidase/*analysis/immunology', 'Peroxidase/*analysis/immunology', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",1997/06/15 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1997/06/15 00:00'],"['1997/06/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1997/06/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0320(19970615)30:3<134::AID-CYTO4>3.0.CO;2-L [pii]'],ppublish,Cytometry. 1997 Jun 15;30(3):134-44.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In human endometrium, LIF expression is significantly increased in the mid-luteal phase indicating that LIF may also play an important role in the human. We have previously shown that a single dose of 200 mg of mifepristone immediately post-ovulation is an effective contraceptive method, probably due to inhibition of endometrial development and function. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of various doses of mifepristone on endometrial LIF expression. A total of 22 fertile, regularly-menstruating women were studied during control and treatment cycles. The subjects were divided into four groups: group I received a single dose of 200 mg of mifepristone on cycle day LH + 2 (n = 7). The subjects in groups II and III were treated with either 5 mg (n = 5) or 2.5 mg (n = 5) once a week for 2 months. Group IV subjects received 0.5 mg per day (n = 5) of mifepristone for 3 months. LIF was measured immunohistochemically in endometrial tissue specimens taken on the corresponding day (cycle day LH + 6 to LH + 8) in hormonally-characterized control and treatment cycles. LIF immunostaining was observed in all controls and located to the cytoplasm of the luminal and glandular epithelial cells and stromal cells. In the treatment cycles the staining of luminal epithelium and stroma was similar to controls, while the glandular staining was reduced in all treatment groups. This study reveals that early luteal phase treatment as well as intermittent or daily low dose treatment with mifepristone reduces endometrial glandular LIF expression at the expected time of implantation. The results further support the contraceptive potential of mifepristone in low doses.","['Danielsson, K G', 'Swahn, M L', 'Bygdeman, M']","['Danielsson KG', 'Swahn ML', 'Bygdeman M']","['Department of Woman and Child Health, Karolinska Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Hum Reprod,"Human reproduction (Oxford, England)",8701199,"['0 (Contraceptive Agents, Female)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Hormone Antagonists)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Luteolytic Agents)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Receptors, Progesterone)', '320T6RNW1F (Mifepristone)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Contraceptive Agents, Female/administration & dosage', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Embryo Implantation/drug effects', 'Endometrium/*drug effects/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Growth Inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Hormone Antagonists/*administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Luteal Phase/*drug effects/*metabolism', 'Luteolytic Agents/administration & dosage', 'Lymphokines/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mifepristone/*administration & dosage', 'Receptors, Progesterone/antagonists & inhibitors']",1997/06/01 00:00,1997/06/01 00:01,['1997/06/01 00:00'],"['1997/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/humrep/12.6.1293 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Reprod. 1997 Jun;12(6):1293-7. doi: 10.1093/humrep/12.6.1293.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

LIF improves the rate of fertilization of mouse oocytes in vitro and up-regulates aromatase enzyme. We postulated that LIF may be an important modulator of ovarian function and may also improve embryo quality in humans. Follicular fluid samples from patients undergoing in-vitro fertilization (IVF) and embryo transfer (n = 123), from women undergoing ovarian stimulation (n = 4) and from women undergoing laparoscopy for tubal ligation during their follicular phase (n = 3) were used. Follicular fluid LIF, oestradiol, and progesterone were measured and embryo quality was assessed. Granulosa-lutein cells were cultured for 3 days in Ham's F-12:Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM). Ovarian stromal cells, isolated by enzymatic dispersion of ovarian tissue, were also cultured in the same medium. Following experimental treatments, LIF mRNA and protein concentrations were quantified. The concentration of LIF was 0.8 +/- 0.3 (mean +/- SEM) pg/ml in pre-human chorionic gonadotrophin (HCG) follicular fluid samples and 13.0 +/- 1.1 pg/ml in post-HCG follicular fluid samples (P < 0.05). LIF levels were undetectable in three follicular fluid samples obtained during unstimulated follicular phase. There was a correlation between follicular fluid LIF and follicular fluid oestradiol concentrations (r = 0.36; P = 0.0001) and the number of grade I embryos (r = 0.62; P = 0.01). LIF mRNA and the protein were expressed constitutively but in low amounts in the ovarian stromal cell cultures. The concentrations of LIF mRNA as well as protein were increased by interleukin (IL)-1alpha and tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) in a time- and concentration-dependent manner.

Fludarabine].,45-50,"New purine analogues, fludarabine, 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine and 2-deoxycoformycin are remarkably active in generally incurable malignant lymphoproliferative disorders. The first part of the review summarises pharmacological properties, the mechanism of action, toxicity and clinical use of fludarabine. Major clinical experience with fludarabine has been obtained in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL). In the studies in pretreated patients with CLL, the overall response rate was over 50%. In previously untreated patients with CLL response rate of 75-80% was recorded with a high ratio of complete responses. Fludarabine was found to be active agent in indolent lymphoma in phase I/II. Approximately 60% of patients with follicular lymphoma respond to fludarabine monotherapy. Combination of fludarabine with cytosine arabinoside (ara-C) is now successfully used in the treatment of acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Other potential areas of use for fludarabine include hairy-cell leukaemia, Waldenstrom's macroglobulinaemia and mycosis fungoides. Myelosupression, especially leuko and lymphopenia is the major dose-limiting adverse effect of fludarabine. A long term reduction in CD4+ T cell count may be associated with an increased incidence of opportunistic infections. Other adverse effects such as nausea and vomiting or neurotoxicity are of mild to moderate severity when the recommended dosage is used.","['Vasova, I', 'Penka, M', 'Hajek, R', 'Mayer, J', 'Krahulcova, E']","['Vasova I', 'Penka M', 'Hajek R', 'Mayer J', 'Krahulcova E']",['II. interni klinika FN Brno-Bohunice.'],['cze'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Czech Republic,Vnitr Lek,Vnitrni lekarstvi,0413602,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Vidarabine/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use']",1997/01/01 00:00,1997/01/01 00:01,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Vnitr Lek. 1997 Jan;43(1):45-50.,41,,,,,Nova purinova analoga v lecbe hematologickych malignit.

The patients were uncomplicated in good nutritional status and nutritional requirements were covered by oral diet under the daily assistance of specially trained dietary nurse. Resting energy expenditure (REE) measured by indirect calorimetry under standard circumstances was elevated to 113.1% of predicted value by Harris-Benedict equation. We found a significant decrease in REE to 106.1% of predicted value (p < 0.01) on day 7 after the beginning of induction chemotherapy. Total energy requirements calculated on the basis of measured REE were not elevated during chemotherapy and mean energy balance was balanced. On the other hand mean nitrogen balance was markedly negative during chemotherapy even on the second day of treatment (-6.9 gN/day, cumulative nitrogen balance -28.0 gN/5 days). The negativity correlated will with markedly elevated urinary nitrogen output but worse with nitrogen intake in the diet. Significant correlation was found between the negativity of cumulative nitrogen balance for the whole period of follow up and the magnitude of decrease in REE after chemotherapy (r = 0.74, p < 0.01). This dependence may give evidence of the decay of tumor mass as the main factor of changes shown. Findings described here may support the assumption that energy requirements of haematooncological patients in good nutrition status during chemotherapy may be covered by oral diet even though this usually does not prevent the negativity of nitrogen balance.","['Tomiska, M', 'Dastych, M', 'Dolezalova, J', 'Vorlicek, J']","['Tomiska M', 'Dastych M', 'Dolezalova J', 'Vorlicek J']","['II. interni klinika FN, Brno-Bohunice.']",['cze'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Czech Republic,Vnitr Lek,Vnitrni lekarstvi,0413602,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'N762921K75 (Nitrogen)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Calorimetry, Indirect', 'Energy Metabolism/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Lymphoma/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Multiple Myeloma/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Nitrogen/*metabolism']",1997/01/01 00:00,1997/01/01 00:01,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Vnitr Lek. 1997 Jan;43(1):18-24.,,,,,,Vliv chemoterapie na energetickou a dusikovou bilanci u hematoonkologickych nemocnych.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of this paper is to estimate the cost-effectiveness ratios of the screening test used in France. Four risks were studied: HIV, HBV, HCV and HTLV. Two efficiency measures were used: cost per positive blood donation detected and cost per case of prevented infection transmission. Moreover, for HTLV alone, the efficiency was estimated by the cost per prevented pathology. Data concerning the costs were provided by the French Blood Agency; those concerning the results of the screening campaigns were provided by the official health authorities, the other data used in the calculations were drawn either from the French Blood Agency data or from a review of international literature. Results gave information about the expenditure devoted to the screening of virologic risks associated with blood transfusion in France (250 million francs per year for the four viruses studied). They stressed the differences in screening efficiency according to the test studied (the cost by prevented seroconversion varied from 31,795 francs for HBV, 72,180 francs for HCV, 676,596 francs for HIV to 6,137,346 francs for HTLV screening test in the base case) and especially the very low efficiency of the systematic screening of the HTLV virus (from 34 to 307 million francs per prevented leukemia).","['Sailly, J C', 'Lebrun, T', 'Coudeville, L']","['Sailly JC', 'Lebrun T', 'Coudeville L']","['CRESGE, Lille.']",['fre'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",France,Rev Epidemiol Sante Publique,Revue d'epidemiologie et de sante publique,7608039,,IM,"['Blood/*virology', 'Blood Transfusion/*economics/standards', 'Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'France', 'HIV/isolation & purification', 'Health Expenditures', 'Hepacivirus/isolation & purification', 'Hepatitis B virus/isolation & purification', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/isolation & purification', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 2/isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Tests/economics', 'Male']",1997/04/01 00:00,1997/04/01 00:01,['1997/04/01 00:00'],"['1997/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Rev Epidemiol Sante Publique. 1997 Apr;45(2):131-41.,17,,,,,"Approche cout-efficacite du depistage des virus VIH, VHB, VHC, HTLV chez les donneurs de sang en France.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, there has been some reluctance from hospital actors, especially because of the heterogeneous nature of DRG's. To analyse this situation, we propose a method based on distribution modelization of length of stays and costs within DRGs. For each DRG, the model is based on a mixture of Poisson and Weibull distributions identified as subgroups. The subgroups are characterized by their means and their proportions which are estimated by maximization of data likelihood. For a particular DRG, the proportion of long stay or high-cost patients can be explained by the introduction of clinical variables in the model. First the model was applied to the DRG ""leukemia and lymphoma"" (HCFA V.3), using 133 discharge abstract files from the Dijon public teaching hospital which were classified into this DRG in 1993. Among the studies parameters only acute leukemia, neutropenia < 500 PNN/mm3, high dose aplastic chemotherapy, central venous catheterization, parenteral nutrition, use of protected or laminar air flow room, septicemia, large spectrum intravenous antibiotherapy, and blood transfusion had a significant influence on the distribution of the patients in the long stay or costly subgroup.

These results were apparently superior to those obtained with the ANLL 861 and 8912 protocols, which used conventional doses of multiple drugs followed by a moderate post remission chemotherapy of long duration. This favorable response with the ANLL 9205 protocol was attributed mainly to the high induction rate of patients with the M4 and M5 FAB subtypes, as compared to those in the previous two protocols (93.3% in ANLL 9205 vs. 57.9% in ANLL 861 + 8912; P < 0.05).

All patients received the same cytoreductive therapy (half doses of vincristine and prednisolone) and the same first and second induction courses (vincristine, prednisolone, high-dose methotrexate, repetitive high-dose cyclophosphamide, and adriamycin). Three cycles of consolidation blocks A and B (consisting of reduced doses of similar agents used in the second induction course) followed for patients with stage III or IV NHL or B-ALL, while only one cycle was given for stage I or II disease. Fifty-three patients (93.0%) achieved complete remission. Eight patients had relapse all occurring within 1 year. Another patient had secondary myelodysplastic syndrome. The median follow-up period was 48 months (range: 24-94 months). The overall survival and event-free survival (EFS) rates for all patients were, respectively, 75.9% (S.E.: 5.9) and 70.1 (S.E.: 6.1). The relapse-free interval rate of the 53 patients who achieved CR was 83.5% (S.E.: 5.3).

CPM induced apoptosis with 10-20% apoptotic cells at 10(-6) M, but higher doses (> 10(-5) M) caused a rapid cell death by necrosis. The cell cycle position of apoptotic cells was assessed by the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) assay of DNA strand breaks combined with DNA staining. MTX, Ara-C, CPT, VP-16 and ADR preferentially induced apoptosis in the S phase. PRD and 6MP induced apoptosis in the G1 phase and G1 + S phases, respectively. CPM showed no cell cycle phase specificity.

The elimination half-life of rhG-CSF varied with the disorder. The half-life of an initial dose of rhG-CSF (2 micrograms/weight kg) was significantly prolonged in patients with aplastic anemia (2.7 +/- 0.3 h, n = 3) and myelodysplastic syndrome-refractory anemia (2.0 +/- 0.3 h, n = 3) when compared with those in normal controls (0.9 +/- 0.5 h, n = 3). In contrast, in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia which was overt leukemia from myelodysplastic syndrome-refractory anemia with excess of blasts in transformation, the half-life was shortened after chemotherapy (0.2 +/- 0.1 h, n = 3). The half-life of rhG-CSF in 2 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia in complete remission was prolonged (2.0 and 2.7 h) at the time of marrow-suppression after chemotherapy and then shortened (0.5, 1.0 h, respectively) in the recovery phase. The half-life of rhG-CSF was very weakly, inversely correlated with absolute neutrophil count in blood (n = 24, r2 = 0.32, P < 0.01), and was inversely correlated with the absolute count of bone-marrow myeloid cells (nucleated cell count in bone-marrow aspirates x the percentage of myeloid cells/100) of patients with aplastic anemia and myelodysplastic syndrome-refractory anemia (n = 12, r2 = 0.63, P = 0.002). These results suggest that the half-life of intravenously administered rhG-CSF (2 micrograms/kg) reflects the size of the myeloid cell compartment in vivo, and support the hypothesis that receptor-mediated consumption mainly accounts for the clearance of exogenous G-CSF.","['Watari, K', 'Ozawa, K', 'Takahashi, S', 'Tojo, A', 'Tani, K', 'Kamachi, S', 'Asano, S']","['Watari K', 'Ozawa K', 'Takahashi S', 'Tojo A', 'Tani K', 'Kamachi S', 'Asano S']","['Department of Hematology-Oncology, University of Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow/*drug effects/pathology', 'Cell Count/drug effects', 'Female', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics', 'Half-Life', 'Hematologic Diseases/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Humans', 'Injections, Intravenous', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutrophils/pathology', 'Recombinant Proteins/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics']",1997/07/01 00:00,1997/07/01 00:01,['1997/07/01 00:00'],"['1997/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0925571097005768 [pii]', '10.1016/s0925-5710(97)00576-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 1997 Jul;66(1):57-67. doi: 10.1016/s0925-5710(97)00576-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The predisposing factors other than neutropenia are not clear. There are also contradictions about treatment. Therefore, this entity still presents a diagnostic and therapeutic dilemma for clinicians. This retrospective study was performed to determine the incidence of neutropenic enterocolitis in adult leukemic patients, to examine the possible risk factors, clinical characteristics and treatment outcome. The pathogenesis is also discussed considering clinical and laboratory findings of the patients. The incidence of neutropenic enterocolitis was 6.5% for acute myeloid leukemia and 4.6% for acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The mean absolute neutrophil count at diagnosis was 48/mm3 (median: 0/mm3). The median duration of severe neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count < or = 500/mm3) on follow-up before the diagnosis was 32 days. Thirteen out of 20 patients had received antineoplastic drugs within the last 12 days, but 2 had not. Fourteen patients had signs of peritoneal irritation and 3 of them underwent surgery. The others received supportive measures, i.e. bowel rest, intravenous fluids, combinations of wide spectrum antibiotics, transfusions, hemodynamic supports and nasogastric decompression, if necessary. All 3 patients who underwent surgery survived, whereas only 1 of the 11 who received other treatments did. Six patients without signs of peritonitis were treated with antibiotics and the mentioned supportive measures. Four survived, but the others died due to sepsis. In conclusion, considering some recent reports that stated good outcome with conservative measures in the presence or absence of peritonitis, there is still debate regarding the optimal choice of treatment. The importance of early diagnosis cannot be overemphasized. Signs of peritoneal irritation indicate a life threatening condition. Surgery can be performed successfully in such patients. Long duration of neutropenia may be an important risk for neutropenic enterocolitis.","['Buyukasik, Y', 'Ozcebe, O I', 'Haznedaroglu, I C', 'Sayinalp, N', 'Soylu, A R', 'Ozdemir, O', 'Dundar, S']","['Buyukasik Y', 'Ozcebe OI', 'Haznedaroglu IC', 'Sayinalp N', 'Soylu AR', 'Ozdemir O', 'Dundar S']","['Hacettepe University Medical School, Department of Hematology, Ankara, Turkey.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Chronic Disease', 'Enterocolitis/diagnosis/*etiology/therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*complications', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors']",1997/07/01 00:00,1997/07/01 00:01,['1997/07/01 00:00'],"['1997/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0925571097005860 [pii]'],ppublish,Int J Hematol. 1997 Jul;66(1):47-55.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Morphological and cytochemical staining showed that SAS-1 cells were round with basophilic cytoplasm which is positive for peroxidase. Analysis of surface markers revealed that SAS-1 cells were myeloblasts derived from an immature progenitor origin, which express CD34. The consensus karyotype of the cell line was 41 XY 5q-, -7, 11p-, 12p+, -13, -14, -16, -17, -19, -22, with two markers. The proliferation of SAS-1 cells was dependent on the presence of either granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) or interleukin-3 (IL-3), and GM-CSF- and IL-3-induced proliferation was dose dependent. Neither, stem cell factor (SCF) nor granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) alone supported the growth of SAS-1 cells, but supported their viability for more than 4 days and arrested them in the G0/G1 phase. SCF also enhanced GM-CSF- or IL-3-induced growth, but other cytokines did not have this synergistic effect.

We reviewed the English literature, and we added our cases of endocrine and metabolic adverse effects, such as hypercalcemia, male infertility, bone marrow necrosis, fibrosis and acute pancreatitis. We also described our cases of thromboembolic events, RA-dependent growth of pathologic cells including Sweet's syndrome, erythema nodosum, hyperhistaminemia, granulomatous proliferation, and mild cases of pulmonary complications. In addition, we reviewed the efficacy of RA administration for other types of leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome. RA and chemotherapeutic agents might induce complete remission, but we obtained a response in only one case of M2 in the third relapse. During RA administration the patient should be monitored for these adverse effects, and early diagnosis and appropriate treatment are important.","['Hatake, K', 'Uwai, M', 'Ohtsuki, T', 'Tomizuka, H', 'Izumi, T', 'Yoshida, M', 'Miura, Y']","['Hatake K', 'Uwai M', 'Ohtsuki T', 'Tomizuka H', 'Izumi T', 'Yoshida M', 'Miura Y']","['Department of Medicine, Jichi Medical School, Tochigi, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Tretinoin/*adverse effects/therapeutic use']",1997/07/01 00:00,1997/07/01 00:01,['1997/07/01 00:00'],"['1997/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0925571096005786 [pii]', '10.1016/s0925-5710(96)00578-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 1997 Jul;66(1):13-9. doi: 10.1016/s0925-5710(96)00578-6.,46,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Lymphocyte blastogenesis to mitogens, seven tests of neutrophil function, and mononuclear cell subset analysis by flow cytometry (BoCD4, BoCD8, BoCD2, BoWC1, sIgM+, and monocytes) were performed at regular intervals to 49 months post-infection. These data were analyzed for main effects of each virus and interaction as a 2 x 2 factorial. BIV infected cattle had lower neutrophil antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity and iodination responses during 2 of the 4 years post-infection (P < 0.05). BIV infection was not associated with any long-term significant changes in lymphocyte blastogenesis to mitogens or changes in mononuclear cell subset numbers in blood. There was a tendency for animals infected with BIV alone to have decreased lymphocyte blastogenic responses to mitogens, but this was not statistically significant. BLV infection caused an increase in total mononuclear cells with no dramatic shift in the relative proportions of the various subsets. Co-infection with BIV and BLV did not consistently cause a different response than either virus did individually. One BIV infected animal died of non-BLV lymphosarcoma 7 months after infection. All other animals had no unusual clinical signs. In summary, infection with BIV caused a significant, temporary decrease in neutrophil function with no consistent statistically significant alteration in lymphocyte blastogenesis or mononuclear cell numbers during the first 4 years after infection. BLV infection caused an increase in lymphocyte numbers, and there appeared to be no synergism between the viruses.","['Flaming, K P', 'Frank, D E', 'Carpenter, S', 'Roth, J A']","['Flaming KP', 'Frank DE', 'Carpenter S', 'Roth JA']","['Department of Microbiology, Immunology, and Preventive medicine, Iowa State University, Ames 50011, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Vet Immunol Immunopathol,Veterinary immunology and immunopathology,8002006,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cattle', 'Cattle Diseases/*immunology', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Enzootic Bovine Leukosis/blood/etiology/*immunology', 'Immunity, Cellular', 'Immunodeficiency Virus, Bovine/*immunology', 'Lentivirus Infections/blood/*immunology/*veterinary', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/*immunology', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Male', 'Neutrophils/immunology', 'Random Allocation']",1997/05/01 00:00,1997/05/01 00:01,['1997/05/01 00:00'],"['1997/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0165-2427(96)05730-3 [pii]', '10.1016/s0165-2427(96)05730-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Vet Immunol Immunopathol. 1997 May;56(1-2):27-38. doi: 10.1016/s0165-2427(96)05730-3.,,,"['R01 CA50159/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA59125/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

During 120-h treatment, HNSCC cell lines A253 and FaDu are equally sensitive to MTX, whereas the polyglutamylatable TS inhibitors ZD1694 and BW1843U89 are 5- to 35-fold more potent than MTX and the lipophilic AG331 is approximately 10(2)-fold less potent than MTX. A253 is intrinsically resistant to intermittent (24 h) MTX and BW1843U89 exposure (higher EC50 values and shallower slopes of concentration-response curves relative to FaDu); AG331 and ZD1694 largely overcome this intrinsic resistance to intermittent exposure. Thymidine (TdR) protects against growth inhibition by these inhibitors, confirming that TS is their target in HNSCC; at high AG331 levels, TdR only partially protects, implying that a second site of action exists. Growth inhibition of HNSCC by ZD1694 and BW1843U89 is protected by leucovorin (LV) at > or = 10(-7) and > 10(-3) M, respectively; 10(-4) M LV cannot protect HNSCC cells against AG331. Results similar to protection studies are obtained if LV addition is delayed < or = 24 h after ZD1694 or BW1843U89 exposure. CCRF-CEM sublines with acquired MTX resistance resulting from dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) overexpression, defective MTX transport, or defective MTX polyglutamylation retain full sensitivity to AG331. Cells with defective MTX transport are highly cross-resistant to ZD1694 and BW1843U89, implicating the reduced folate/MTX carrier in their transport. Minor cross-resistance of the DHFR overexpressing line to ZD1694 and BW1843U89 is observed. A subline with highly defective MTX polyglutamylation is cross-resistant to 120-h exposure to ZD1694, but not to BW1843U89, suggesting a profound contribution of polyglutamylation to the mechanism of action of ZD1694.","['McGuire, J J', 'Magee, K J', 'Russell, C A', 'Canestrari, J M']","['McGuire JJ', 'Magee KJ', 'Russell CA', 'Canestrari JM']","['Department of Experimental Therapeutics, Grace Cancer Drug Center, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, NY 14263, USA. mcguire@ac3101.med.buffalo.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Oncol Res,Oncology research,9208097,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.1.1.45 (Thymidylate Synthase)', 'Q573I9DVLP (Leucovorin)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Growth Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Head and Neck Neoplasms/*drug therapy/enzymology', 'Humans', 'Leucovorin/pharmacology', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/enzymology', 'Methotrexate/pharmacology', 'Thymidylate Synthase/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1997/01/01 00:00,1997/01/01 00:01,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncol Res. 1997;9(3):139-47.,,,"['CA16056/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA65755/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We developed and standardized an opsonophagocytic assay using HL-60 cells (human promyelocytic leukemia cells). Fifty-five serum samples were analyzed for the presence of functional antibody against seven pneumococcal serogroups or serotypes (4, 6B, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F, and 23F) by using differentiated HL-60 cells (granulocytes) and peripheral blood leukocytes (PBLs). Six of the 55 serum samples were from unvaccinated adult volunteers, 31 serum samples were from adults who received one dose of the 14-valent or the 23-valent polysaccharide vaccine, and 18 serum samples were from 16-month-old infants who received four doses of an investigational 7-valent polysaccharide-protein conjugate vaccine. The results of an opsonophagocytic assay with HL-60 cells correlated highly with those of an assay with PBLs as effector cells (median r for seven serotypes = 0.87: P < 0.01). Opsonophagocytic titers were compared with the immunoglobulin G antibody concentrations determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The r values for serogroups or serotypes 4, 6B, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F, and 23F were 0.61, 0.60, 0.67 0.90, 0.61, 0.39, and 0.57, respectively, when HL-60 cells were used as effector cells and 0.56, 0.47, 0.61, 0.90, 0.71, 0.31, and 0.62, respectively, when PBLs were used.

Northern blot analysis revealed that clone 801 expressed all three classes of HIV mRNAs. Multispliced 2 kb mRNAs were detected in another clone (8.14). Two other clones (1.31 and 1.32) also exhibited a complete HIV provirus, but did not show any viral expression, as evaluated by Northern blot analysis or HIV p24 ELISA. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) experiments revealed the presence of full length genomic RNA in four transfected clones, which were extensively characterized. A co-cultivation of clone 801 with human CD4' cells resulted in syncytia formation. By electron microscopy, mature HIV particles were observed after co-cultivation of uninfected C8166 cells with 801 cells. These results demonstrated that the murine clone was stably transfected with the complete HIV genome and was capable of shuttling infectious HIV to human cells. Clone 801 was co-cultivated with murine NIH-3T3 fibroblasts. In several experiments, HIV infection of NIH-3T3 cells was revealed by PCR technique.

METHODS: Established melanoma (A375, C81-61), colon (SW480), lung (A549), lymphomoblastoid leukemia (LCL-B), promyelocytic leukemia (HL60), prostate (PC-3, DU145), and breast (MCF7) cell lines were injected at subcutaneous (s.c.), intraperitoneal (i.p.), or mammary fat pad (MFP) sites. Tumor volume growth curves and survival curves were established for the various tumor cell lines. Carmustine (BCNU), cisplatin (CDDP), cyclophosphamide (CPA), doxorubicin, dacarbazine (DTIC), tamoxifen and vincristine were injected s.c. or i.p.. The chemotherapeutic drug effects on tumor volumes and survival were determined. RESULTS: Tumor growth occurred with each cell type. After i.p. injection, 90% mortality occurred within 26 to 60 days except for the early passage melanoma cell line UACC1273 with which mortality occurred within approximately 90 days. In the MCF7 breast model, treatment with tamoxifen (P < 0.001) and CPA (P < 0.0001) resulted in significant tumor growth delay compared with control groups. BCNU and CDDP resulted in significant tumor growth delays relative to control in SW480 colon cancer (P < 0.0014) and A375 melanoma (P < 0.0001) models, respectively. CPA and doxorubicin improved survival in the HL60 leukemia model (P = 0.0018). CONCLUSIONS: These scid mouse human tumor models appear to reflect the clinical situation in that clinically active chemotherapeutic drugs are similarly active in the scid mouse models. Therefore, the scid mouse models may be useful for testing new chemotherapeutic agents against various human cancer types.","['Paine-Murrieta, G D', 'Taylor, C W', 'Curtis, R A', 'Lopez, M H', 'Dorr, R T', 'Johnson, C S', 'Funk, C Y', 'Thompson, F', 'Hersh, E M']","['Paine-Murrieta GD', 'Taylor CW', 'Curtis RA', 'Lopez MH', 'Dorr RT', 'Johnson CS', 'Funk CY', 'Thompson F', 'Hersh EM']","['Department of Medicine, Arizona Cancer Center, University of Arizona College of Medicine, Tucson 85724, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', '*Disease Models, Animal', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Severe Combined Immunodeficiency/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Skin Neoplasms/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Survival Rate', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/pathology']",1997/01/01 00:00,1997/01/01 00:01,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s002800050648 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 1997;40(3):209-14. doi: 10.1007/s002800050648.,,,"['CA17094/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA23074/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA41183/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: Tumour cells from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) were found to be more sensitive to both drugs than those of tumour cells from patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), acute myoblastic leukaemia (AML) and various solid tumours. There was a close correlation between the effects of the two drugs (correlation coefficient 0.71), but CsA was slightly more active than PSC in most diagnoses. No tumour cells sample showed sensitivity to PSC without also being sensitive to CsA. There was a moderate level of correlation between the activity pattern of CsA and doxorubicin (correlation coefficient 0.66), whereas the correlations with other cytostatics, such as vincristine, cytarabine and melphalan, were low (correlation coefficient -0.11 to 0.33). CONCLUSION: The results indicate that PSC shares the direct cytotoxic properties of CsA, but is slightly less potent. Clinical testing of the cytotoxic effect of these agents in haematological malignancies seems warranted and the apparent non-cross-resistance with standard agents makes cyclosporins a potentially useful adjunct to chemotherapy in those diagnoses.","['Martinsson, P', 'Nygren, P', 'Fridborg, H', 'Nilsson, K', 'Kristensen, J', 'Larsson, R']","['Martinsson P', 'Nygren P', 'Fridborg H', 'Nilsson K', 'Kristensen J', 'Larsson R']","['Department of Clinical Pharmacology, University Hospital, Uppsala University, Sweden.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Eur J Clin Pharmacol,European journal of clinical pharmacology,1256165,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cyclosporins)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', 'Q7ZP55KF3X (valspodar)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cyclosporine/*pharmacology', 'Cyclosporins/*pharmacology', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1997/01/01 00:00,1997/01/01 00:01,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s002280050274 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Clin Pharmacol. 1997;52(3):199-203. doi: 10.1007/s002280050274.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Viral transcription is rather restricted in basal strata but increases dramatically in the spinous cells. Inopportune viral oncoprotein expression in the basal reserve cells can lead to dysplasias and carcinomas. Until now all studies to identify transcription factor binding sites within the upstream regulatory region (URR) that controls the expression of the oncogene have been conducted in proliferating cell cultures. We report the establishment of a reproducible and convenient system to examine cis elements important for differentiation-dependent transcriptional regulation. The bacterial lacZ gene under the control of the HPV URR-E6 promoter was transduced into primary human keratinocytes from neonatal foreskin by using high titer recombinant retroviruses. Acutely infected PHKs were then grown into stratified and differentiated epithelium on collagen rafts. lacZ expression was almost entirely restricted to the spinous cells, indicating that promoter activity was differentiation dependent, as seen in vivo. Using this system, we initiated a mutational analysis of previously identified promoter and enhancer elements within the HPV-18 URR. Three categories of mutation were observed: those that caused severe, moderate, or very small reduction in lacZ expressions. The results show both similarities and differences to previously published and present studies in proliferating primary human keratinocytes in monolayer cultures or in immortalized or transformed cell lines. This system is applicable to study both host and viral promoters that require squamous differentiation for their activity.","['Parker, J N', 'Zhao, W', 'Askins, K J', 'Broker, T R', 'Chow, L T']","['Parker JN', 'Zhao W', 'Askins KJ', 'Broker TR', 'Chow LT']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Alabama at Birmingham 35294-0005, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cell Growth Differ,Cell growth & differentiation : the molecular biology journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9100024,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (E6 protein, Human papillomavirus type 18)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Viral)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', '*DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic/*genetics', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral/*genetics', 'Genetic Vectors/genetics', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Keratinocytes/cytology/*physiology', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Viral/genetics', 'Papillomaviridae/*genetics', 'Point Mutation', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Skin/cytology']",1997/07/01 00:00,1997/07/01 00:01,['1997/07/01 00:00'],"['1997/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cell Growth Differ. 1997 Jul;8(7):751-62.,,,"['CA36200/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CAO9467-13/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hox proteins show a relaxed DNA-binding selectivity in vitro, suggesting that functional specificity is achieved in vivo through the action of transcriptional co-factors. Pbx proteins are good candidates for such a role, on the basis of both genetic and biochemical evidence. We report that the human Pbx1 and HOXB1 proteins can cooperatively activate transcription through a genetically characterized Hox target, i.e. an autoregulatory element directing spatially restricted expression of the murine Hoxb-1 gene (b1-ARE) in the developing hindbrain. On the b1-ARE, only a restricted subset of HOX proteins (HOXA1, HOXB1, HOXA2) are able to bind cooperatively with Pbx1 and activate transcription. Selective recognition of the b1-ARE is mediated by the N-terminal region of the HOX homeodomain. The DNA-binding and protein-protein interaction functions of HOXB1 and Pbx1 are all necessary for the assembly of a transcriptionally active complex on the b1-ARE. Functional dissection of the complex allowed the localization of the main activation domain in the HOXB1 N-terminal region, and of an additional one in the C-terminal region of Pbx1 contained in the Pbx1a but not in the alternatively spliced Pbx1b isoform. Our results indicate that Pbx1 acts as a transcriptional co-factor of Hox proteins, allowing selective recognition and cooperative activation of regulatory target sequences.","['Di Rocco, G', 'Mavilio, F', 'Zappavigna, V']","['Di Rocco G', 'Mavilio F', 'Zappavigna V']","['DIBIT-Istituto Scientifico H.S.

OKT9-CIL, prepared by conjugation of DOX-encapsulated liposome with an anti-TFR monoclonal antibody, OKT9 (Aisenberg and Wilkes, 1980), showed similar binding to both K562 and K562/ADM. Although an 80-fold higher sensitivity to free DOX on cell growth inhibition in K562 than in K562/ADM was found, the difference was clearly diminished after OKT9-CIL treatment through the increased sensitivity of K562/ADM. The cellular DOX level 30 min after the exposure of free DOX was 45-fold lower in K562/ADM than in K562, whereas nearly equivalent DOX levels were detected in K562 and K562/ADM after OKT9-CIL treatment. In addition, DOX in K562/ADM in the free DOX treatment was efficiently excreted by 54% within 120 min of incubation, whereas almost all DOX supplied by OKT9-CIL remained uncleared. Fluorescence microscopic observation showed that OKT9-CIL was internalized into juxtanuclear vesicles in K562/ADM cells. These results suggest that OKT9-CIL has a potency to accumulate DOX, resulting in augmentation of DOX cytotoxicity in DOX-resistant tumour cells.","['Suzuki, S', 'Inoue, K', 'Hongoh, A', 'Hashimoto, Y', 'Yamazoe, Y']","['Suzuki S', 'Inoue K', 'Hongoh A', 'Hashimoto Y', 'Yamazoe Y']","['Department of Hygienic Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Tohoku University, Aobayama, Sendai, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Liposomes)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/administration & dosage', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Doxorubicin/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Liposomes/administration & dosage', 'Receptors, Transferrin/immunology/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/01/01 00:00,1997/01/01 00:01,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/bjc.1997.340 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1997;76(1):83-9. doi: 10.1038/bjc.1997.340.,,,,,PMC2223806,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using a selective and potent inhibitor of protein kinase C, we found that synergistic interaction between PMA and dexamethasone requires protein kinase C activation. PMA has been known to activate nuclear factor NF-kappaB in THP-1 cells. Using an oligonucleotide probe corresponding to an NF-kappaB DNA-binding motif of the IL-1beta gene promoter in gel electrophoresis mobility shift assays, we demonstrated that PMA-induced NF-kappaB activation was greatly potentiated by dexamethasone.

We investigated their equivalents in the rat to clarify whether their structure and pattern of expression are conserved in rodents. Two rat class Ib genes, containing 3' sequences very similar to mouse TL, were identified and designated RT1.P. Neither of them, however, can encode ordinary class I molecules due to the accumulation of harmful mutations in the 5' regions that are unique to RT1.P, while the 3' TL-like regions still retain protein-coding capacity. Comparison of the structural organization of three types of TL family genes, which include mouse T3/T18-encoding TL antigens, mouse T1/T16, and rat RT1. P1/P2 pseudogenes, revealed the presence of a clear demarcation between the type-specific and TL-specific sequences at intron 3. This finding suggests that recombination plays an important role in creating the TL family genes in rodents. Characteristic features of TL, such as a low level of polymorphism and linkage to the major histocompatibility complex, were also observed in the rat. On the other hand, rat CD1 molecules were expressed at a high level on the surface of thymocytes. Absence of authentic TL antigens and thymic expression of CD1d molecules in the rat suggest the plasticity and conservation of class Ib genes in rodent evolution.

LIF and corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) also synergistically induced in vivo ACTH secretion in fetal nonhuman primates. To elucidate the role of the gp130-related cytokines in human pituitary hormone regulation, we tested expression of gp130-related cytokine receptors in human fetal pituitaries. Using RT-PCR, mRNA expression of receptors for LIF, IL-6, and CRH, and the gp130 subunit, were all detected in fetal pituitaries of 18- and 31-wk gestation. Recombinant human IL-6, LIF, and OSM treatments of primary human fetal pituitary cultures (16-31 wk) increased ACTH secretion by up to 48% (P < 0.05) using doses of 1 nM, and when fetal cultures were cotreated with CRH, ACTH was induced five- to sixfold as compared to CRH alone (three- to fourfold; P = 0.01). Incubation with gp130-specific antibody suppressed basal and cytokine-stimulated ACTH secretion (alone or with CRH) from human fetal cells. Human POMC promoter -879/+6 fused to the luciferase reporter gene and transfected into AtT-20 cells, was stimulated by LIF (7-fold), which also exerted strong (22-fold) synergy with CRH on POMC transcription. Growth hormone (GH) release from fetal cultures was modestly stimulated (15-31%, P < 0.05), while other anterior pituitary hormones were not altered by these cytokines. Thus, physiologic concentrations of the gp130-related cytokines have direct effects on ACTH and GH regulation in the human pituitary, indicating that gp130-dependent signals serve as a paracrine system controlling early human pituitary function.","['Shimon, I', 'Yan, X', 'Ray, D W', 'Melmed, S']","['Shimon I', 'Yan X', 'Ray DW', 'Melmed S']","['Department of Medicine, Cedars-Sinai Research Institute, UCLA School of Medicine, Los Angeles, California 90048, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (IL6ST protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (OSM protein, human)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '106956-32-5 (Oncostatin M)', '12629-01-5 (Human Growth Hormone)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)', '66796-54-1 (Pro-Opiomelanocortin)', '9002-60-2 (Adrenocorticotropic Hormone)', '9015-71-8 (Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone)']",IM,"['Adrenocorticotropic Hormone/*metabolism', 'Antibodies/immunology/pharmacology', 'Antigens, CD/immunology/*metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone/metabolism', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130', 'Cytokines/*pharmacology', 'DNA, Complementary', 'Fetus', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Growth Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Human Growth Hormone/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/pharmacology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/pharmacology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/immunology/*metabolism', 'Oncostatin M', 'Peptides/pharmacology', 'Pituitary Gland, Anterior/drug effects/embryology/*metabolism', 'Pro-Opiomelanocortin/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Transfection/genetics']",1997/07/15 00:00,1997/07/15 00:01,['1997/07/15 00:00'],"['1997/07/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/07/15 00:01 [medline]', '1997/07/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1172/JCI119541 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Invest. 1997 Jul 15;100(2):357-63. doi: 10.1172/JCI119541.,,,['DK-50238/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],,PMC508198,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have examined cytidine and guanosine transport in this cell line and characterized a novel guanosine-specific transporter. Cytidine transport occurred predominately by equilibrative nitrobenzylthioinosine (NBMPR)-sensitive (es) transport. In the presence of Na+, guanosine at various concentrations accumulated at least 6-fold above equilibrium. The initial rate of guanosine transport in Na+ buffer decreased by 75% with the addition of 1 microM NBMPR and the IC50 for NBMPR inhibition was 0.7 +/- 0.1 nM. Replacement of Na+ with choline also resulted in a 75% decrease in total guanosine transport. The potent inhibition of guanosine transport by NBMPR and the loss of transport in choline suggested that a Na+-dependent NBMPR-sensitive transporter was responsible for the majority of guanosine uptake. This concentrative, sensitive transporter is Na+ dependent with a stoichiometric coupling ratio of 1:1. This novel transporter, referred to as csg, is guanosine-specific with total guanosine transport inhibited by only 50% in the presence of 1 mM competing nucleosides. HL-60, acute myelocytic leukemia cells, do not exhibit csg activity while L1210, murine acute lymphocytic leukemia cells, exhibit csg transport. The presence of the csg transporter suggests an important role for guanosine in particular forms of leukemia and may provide a new target for cytotoxic therapy.","['Flanagan, S A', 'Meckling-Gill, K A']","['Flanagan SA', 'Meckling-Gill KA']","['Department of Human Biology and Nutritional Sciences, University of Guelph, Guelph, Ontario N1G 2W1, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Nucleosides)', '12133JR80S (Guanosine)', '46S541971T (Thioinosine)', '5CSZ8459RP (Cytidine)', '9NEZ333N27 (Sodium)', 'GV1L2DZM2Z (4-nitrobenzylthioinosine)', 'N91BDP6H0X (Choline)']",IM,"['Biological Transport/drug effects', 'Carrier Proteins/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Choline/pharmacology', 'Cytidine/metabolism', 'Guanosine/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Nucleosides/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Sodium/*pharmacology', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Thioinosine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/07/18 00:00,1997/07/18 00:01,['1997/07/18 00:00'],"['1997/07/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/07/18 00:01 [medline]', '1997/07/18 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.272.29.18026 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(18)39114-2 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1997 Jul 18;272(29):18026-32. doi: 10.1074/jbc.272.29.18026.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A combination of single cell fluorescence and patch clamp techniques were used to study the mechanisms underlying thrombin-evoked Ca2+ signals in human erythroleukaemia (HEL) cells, a leukaemic cell line of platelet-megakaryocyte lineage. 2. Thrombin caused a transient increase in intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i), consisting of both release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores and influx of extracellular Ca2+. Mn2+ quench studies indicated that the thrombin-evoked divalent cation-permeable pathway was activated during, but not prior to, release from internal stores. 3. Thapsigargin (1 microM) irreversibly released internal Ca2+ from the same store as that released by thrombin and continuously activated a Ca(2+)-influx mechanism. The amplitude of the thrombin- and thapsigargin-induced Ca2+ influx displayed a marked single cell heterogeneity which showed no correlation with the size of the store Ca2+ transient. 4. In whole-cell patch clamp recordings, both thrombin and thapsigargin evoked an inwardly rectifying Ca2+ current which developed with little or no increase in current noise, showed no reversal in the voltage range -110 to +60 mV and was blocked by 1 mM Zn2+. The apparent divalent cation permeability sequence of this pathway was Ca2+ > > Ba2+ > Mn2+, Mg2+. The thapsigargin-evoked current density at -100 mV varied between 0.42 and 2.1 pA pF-1 in different cells. Thrombin failed to activate additional Ca2+ current if it was added after the thapsigargin-induced inward current had fully developed. 5. These studies indicate that thrombin activates Ca2+ influx in HEL cells entirely via a Ca(2+)-store-release-activated Ca2+ current (Icrac) rather than via receptor-operated or second messenger-dependent Ca2+ channels. The level of expression of Icrac appears to be a major factor in determining the duration of the thrombin-evoked [Ca2+]i response and therefore represents a means by which cells can exert control over [Ca2+]i-dependent events.","['Somasundaram, B', 'Mason, M J', 'Mahaut-Smith, M P']","['Somasundaram B', 'Mason MJ', 'Mahaut-Smith MP']","['Physiological Laboratory, Cambridge, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,J Physiol,The Journal of physiology,0266262,"['0 (Cations, Divalent)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '105344-37-4 (fura-2-am)', '42Z2K6ZL8P (Manganese)', '67526-95-8 (Thapsigargin)', 'EC 3.4.21.5 (Thrombin)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)', 'TSN3DL106G (Fura-2)']",IM,"['Calcium/*metabolism', 'Cations, Divalent/metabolism', 'Electrophysiology', 'Fluorescence', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'Fura-2/analogs & derivatives', 'Humans', 'Ion Transport/drug effects', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Manganese/metabolism', 'Patch-Clamp Techniques', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/*physiology', 'Thapsigargin/pharmacology', 'Thrombin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/06/15 00:00,1997/06/15 00:01,['1997/06/15 00:00'],"['1997/06/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/06/15 00:01 [medline]', '1997/06/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1469-7793.1997.485bm.x [doi]'],ppublish,J Physiol. 1997 Jun 15;501 ( Pt 3):485-95. doi: 10.1111/j.1469-7793.1997.485bm.x.,,,['NS27177/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States'],,PMC1159450,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Detection of such abnormalities usually heralds a poor prognosis. The loss of DNA on chromosome 7 has led to speculation that tumour-suppressor genes may play a significant role in this form of leukaemogenesis, although it may be part of a multistep process. A further association with leukaemia secondary to carcinogen exposure including previous chemotherapy or a number of congenital anaemias has increased the interest in discovering the gene or genes on chromosome 7. Banded chromosome analysis has suggested that there are two broad critical regions on the long arm of chromosome 7 at bands 7q22 and 7q34-q36 that may contain the relevant genes. Initial molecular analysis has confirmed these two regions to be of significance. The advent of fluorescence in-situ hybridization techniques has facilitated some definition of the 7q22 region, with identification of candidate genes for further functional analysis. It is becoming clear that there will be more than one gene on chromosome 7 involved in the leukaemic process and with the definition of these genes it may be possible to look for associations with different phenotypes and prognosis. As for the reason for chromosome 7 showing a particular predisposition to total or partial loss we may speculate that the DNA sequence and structure may confer a 'fragility' on the chromosome. A greater understanding of the DNA structure of the long arm may provide real insight into the mechanisms of leukaemia. We would like to speculate in the long term that this could lead to the ability to screen for leukaemia susceptibility and avoidance of 'inducers' in those at risk.","['Johnson, E', 'Cotter, F E']","['Johnson E', 'Cotter FE']","['Molecular Haematology Unit, Institute of Child Health, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Blood Rev,Blood reviews,8708558,,IM,"['Acute Disease', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/complications/*genetics', '*Monosomy']",1997/03/01 00:00,1997/03/01 00:01,['1997/03/01 00:00'],"['1997/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0268-960X(97)90006-0 [pii]', '10.1016/s0268-960x(97)90006-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Rev. 1997 Mar;11(1):46-55. doi: 10.1016/s0268-960x(97)90006-0.,127,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Approximately 60-80% of patients less than 60 years of age can be expected to enter complete remission if treated with standard-dose Ara-C (100-200 mg/m2) in combination with an anthracycline. The efficacy of Ara-C appears clinically to be dose and schedule dependent. A 15-30 fold dose escalation in Ara-C can elicit a therapeutic response in patients who have previously failed treatment with standard-dose Ara-C or other anti-leukaemic drugs. The use of high-dose cytosine arabinoside (HDAC 3 gm/m2) appears rational based on cytosine pharmacology. Drug-scheduling is used to exploit drug synergy when HDAC is given in combination with asparaginase or fludarabine (+/- G-CSF) in a schedule-dependent fashion. Toxicity following Ara-C is also dose- and schedule-dependent. Central nervous system toxicity--particularly cerebellar dysfunction--although rare, is particularly serious because it may preclude further use of the drug.

The phagocytic activity of biochanin A-treated JCS cells was also increased. Flow cytometric analysis showed that the expression of macrophage differentiation markers Mac-1 and F4/80 was up-regulated in biochanin A-treated JCS cells. The expression level of Mac-1 was higher than that of F4/80. The expression of cytokine genes was studied by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and cycle titration. mRNA levels of IL-1alpha, IL-1beta and IL-4 were found to be up-regulated at 46 hours after incubation of JCS cells with biochanin A. Although the expression of LIF was also up-regulated, the LIF receptor gene was not expressed in the uninduced or induced JCS cells.

Median first complete remission (CR) duration was 8.5 months (range 1-54 months). 34/61 patients achieved CR (56%); 24 (39%) failed to respond and three (5%) died during induction. Most responders (24 patients) could not enter the BMT programme; 15 relapsed early (median time to relapse 2 months); nine were withdrawn due to toxicity and one died in CR of infection. Nine of the 34 CRs underwent BMT (five autologous and four allogeneic). Three of the four allotransplanted patients are alive in continuous CR at 22, 43 and 63 months; only one of the five who underwent an autologous BMT is alive in CR at 46 months. The estimated disease-free survival (DFS +/- SE) at 36 months was 0.16 +/- 0.08 for all responders. Univariate analysis showed that previous therapy was the only prognostic factor influencing DFS. The estimated probabilities of event-free survival (EFS +/- SE) and survival +/- SE at 37 months were 0.09 +/- 0.04 and 0.10 +/- 0.04, respectively. The EFS was significantly better in patients with a preceding CR > or = 24 months, compared to those with a shorter first remission.

Among these complications, avascular necrosis of bone has been reported, but only two single-centre studies included sufficient patients to enable analysis of the risk factors for developing avascular necrosis. In this multicentre retrospective study the aim was to assess risk factors for this complication in a large number of patients. The population consisted of 4388 patients, recorded in the Societe Francaise de Greffe de Moelle (SFGM) data base, who had undergone a single allogeneic bone marrow transplant between January 1974 and December 1993. 77 patients developed avascular necrosis leading to a 4.3% projected incidence at 5 years. Symptoms developed 2-132 months after transplantation. In these 77 patients a mean of 1.87 joints per patient were affected (range 1-7). The hip joint was the most often affected (88% of patients) and 48% of the patients required joint replacement. All but two patients received steroids for acute and/or chronic graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) over a mean period of 15 months. In univariate analysis, among eight factors tested as risk factors for developing avascular necrosis, six were shown to be linked to an increased risk: older age, diagnosis of aplastic anaemia or acute leukaemia, an irradiation-based conditioning regimen, type of GvHD prophylaxis regimens, acute and chronic GvHD. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, five factors remained significantly associated with an increased risk for developing avascular necrosis: chronic GvHD (odds ratio (OR) 3.52), acute GvHD (OR 3.73), age > 16 years (OR 5.81), aplastic anaemia (OR 3.90), and acute leukaemia (OR 1.72). Avascular necrosis is not a rare late complication of allogeneic bone marrow transplantation causing significant morbidity. In this study, older age, initial diagnosis, and GvHD and/or its treatment with steroids emerged as significant risk factors.","['Socie, G', 'Cahn, J Y', 'Carmelo, J', 'Vernant, J P', 'Jouet, J P', 'Ifrah, N', 'Milpied, N', 'Michallet, M', 'Lioure, B', 'Pico, J L', 'Witz, F', 'Molina, L', 'Fischer, A', 'Bardou, V J', 'Gluckman, E', 'Reiffers, J']","['Socie G', 'Cahn JY', 'Carmelo J', 'Vernant JP', 'Jouet JP', 'Ifrah N', 'Milpied N', 'Michallet M', 'Lioure B', 'Pico JL', 'Witz F', 'Molina L', 'Fischer A', 'Bardou VJ', 'Gluckman E', 'Reiffers J']","['Service de Greffe de Moelle, Hopital Saint Louis, Paris, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*adverse effects/methods/mortality', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chronic Disease', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/drug therapy/etiology', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Osteonecrosis/*etiology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",1997/06/01 00:00,1997/06/01 00:01,['1997/06/01 00:00'],"['1997/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-2141.1997.1262940.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1997 Jun;97(4):865-70. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1997.1262940.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We examined how well Glucksberg grade predicted transplant outcome and constructed a Severity Index not requiring subjective assessment of performance in 2881 adults receiving an HLA-identical sibling T-cell-depleted (n = 752) or non-T-cell-depleted (n = 2129) bone marrow transplant for leukaemia between 1986 and 1992. Relative risks (RR) of relapse, treatment-related mortality (TRM) and treatment failure (TF) (relapse or death) were calculated for patients with (Glucksberg Grade I, II or III/IV acute (GVHD) versus those without acute GVHD and for patients with distinct patterns of organ involvement regardless of Glucksberg grade. Using data for non-T-cell-depleted transplants, a Severity Index was developed grouping patients with patterns of organ involvement associated with similar risks of TRM and TF. Higher Glucksberg grade predicted poorer outcome; however, patients with the same grade but different patterns of skin, liver or gut involvement often had significantly different outcomes. The revised Severity Index groups patients in four categories, A-D. Compared to patients without acute GVHD, RRs (95% confidence interval) of TF were 0.85 (0.69, 1.05) for patients with Index A, 1.21 (1.02, 1.43) with B, 2.19 (1.78, 2.71) with C, and 5.69 (4.57, 7.08) with D.

ECP, which is similar in some ways to PUVA, has been used in this study to treat four paediatric patients who developed chronic GVHD following BMT and in whom GVHD had failed to respond to conventional immunosuppressive therapy. Following ECP, skin lesions cleared almost completely and pulmonary function tests improved in two of three patients with cutaneous and lung involvement. Serum bilirubin and transaminases gradually normalized, and gammaGT decreased considerably in the remaining patient who had a severe cholestatic hepatopathy. The Karnofsky performance score increased to 90% in the three patients with positive responses to ECP and remained unchanged (40%) in the patient who did not respond. Immunosuppressive therapy was reduced in three patients and eventually discontinued in two. No significant side-effects were observed during the treatment.

We conducted a retrospective analysis of 24 cases of CD56+ NK lymphoma/leukaemia to define the clinicopathologic and prognostic features of this specific group of lymphomas. 56 cases of nasal lymphomas and 204 cases with an initial diagnosis of peripheral T-cell lymphoma were retrospectively analysed. To specifically examine lymphomas of putative NK origin, only those that were negative for surface expression of CD3 but positive for CD56 were analysed. 24 cases were identified. The initial predominant sites of involvement were nasal (n = 18), palate (n = 1), nodal (n = 1) and multi-organ (n = 4). Clinically, in patients with disease localized to one anatomical site (n = 20), most had symptoms confined to the nose, with a high percentage in early stage (I: 91%; IV: 9%). The marrow was not involved in any of these cases. However, patients with multi-organ involvement at presentation (n = 4) behaved differently. All presented acutely with pancytopenia, hepatosplenomegaly, and marrow infiltration with haemophagocytosis. A leukaemic phase was observed in one case. Anthracycline containing combination chemotherapy resulted in complete remission in 75% of patients with localized disease, but only in 25% with multi-organ involvement. The median survival of patients with localized disease was 12 months, compared with 2 months in the multi-organ group (P = 0.06); the disease-free survival was significantly better in the former (P < 0.01). The overall median survival of all patients was still poor at 11 months. We conclude that CD56+ NK lymphomas could be divided into two main patterns of disease presentations: localized (predominantly nasal), and multi-organ involvement. Each has different clinicopathologic and prognostic features. Conventional chemotherapy appeared ineffective for the majority of patients, and innovative treatment modalities are needed to improve outcome.","['Kwong, Y L', 'Chan, A C', 'Liang, R', 'Chiang, A K', 'Chim, C S', 'Chan, T K', 'Todd, D', 'Ho, F C']","['Kwong YL', 'Chan AC', 'Liang R', 'Chiang AK', 'Chim CS', 'Chan TK', 'Todd D', 'Ho FC']","['University Department of Medicine, Queen Mary Hospital, Hong Kong.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CD56 Antigen)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*metabolism', 'CD56 Antigen/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*diagnosis/drug therapy/radiotherapy', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell, Peripheral/diagnosis/drug therapy/radiotherapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nose Neoplasms/*diagnosis/drug therapy/radiotherapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome']",1997/06/01 00:00,1997/06/01 00:01,['1997/06/01 00:00'],"['1997/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-2141.1997.1462962.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1997 Jun;97(4):821-9. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1997.1462962.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast, PVC211 virus, which is also a neuropathogenic F-MuLV variant, caused marked spongiform degeneration in the spinal cord. Virus recovery from the spinal cord of A8 virus-infected rat was the same as that of PVC211-infected rat, indicating that there is no direct correlation between the titer of virus and the intensity of lesions. Furthermore, rats infected with the A8 virus at 3 weeks of age did not undergo spongiform degeneration, although recovery of high titer of virus occurred in the central nervous system (CNS). Studies using chimeric viruses between the A8 virus and nonneuropathogenic F-MuLV clone 57 also indicated that the sequences responsible for virus titers in the CNS and neuropathogenicity are different. The chimeric virus studies proved that the env gene and the LTR and/or 5' leader sequence of A8 are critical for the induction of neuropathogenicity.

Although cisplatin has not been found to be an active agent against leukemia, carboplatin-induced complete remissions have been observed in adults with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), and antileukemic activity has been observed in a Phase I trial involving children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and AML. Therefore, a pediatric Phase II study was undertaken to determine the degree of activity of carboplatin in childhood ALL and AML. METHODS: Between October 1991 and November 1994, the Children's Cancer Group conducted a Phase II study of carboplatin given by 5-day continuous intravenous infusion to children with acute leukemia recurring in bone marrow. RESULTS: Minimal antileukemic activity was demonstrated in patients with ALL and AML. One of 21 eligible patients with ALL achieved a partial response. Of 23 eligible patients with AML, including 1 patient with chronic myelogenous leukemia in blast crisis, 1 had hypocellular M1 bone marrow with a platelet count of 15,000/mm3, and 2 achieved partial responses. Nonhematologic toxicities, which were infrequent, included mild hepatic and renal dysfunction. CONCLUSIONS: In this pediatric Phase II trial of carboplatin as a treatment for acute leukemia, minimal activity was demonstrated in patients with ALL and AML recurring in bone marrow. Further evaluation of carboplatin as a treatment for childhood leukemia, using the dose schedule of 216 mg/m2/day given by 5-day continuous intravenous infusion, does not appear warranted.","['Ettinger, L J', 'Ivy, P', 'Gaynon, P S', 'Ettinger, A G', 'Liu-Mares, W', 'Krailo, M D']","['Ettinger LJ', 'Ivy P', 'Gaynon PS', 'Ettinger AG', 'Liu-Mares W', 'Krailo MD']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey-Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, New Brunswick, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'BG3F62OND5 (Carboplatin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Blast Crisis', 'Bone Marrow Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Carboplatin/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Treatment Outcome']",1997/07/15 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1997/07/15 00:00'],"['1997/07/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1997/07/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0142(19970715)80:2<311::AID-CNCR20>3.0.CO;2-W [pii]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1997 Jul 15;80(2):311-6.,,,"['R25 CA092049/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 02971/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 13539/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 17829/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, increased uptake was observed for all compounds in KBALB-STK cells which are transduced with a replication incompetent Moloney murine leukemia virus vector encoding the HSV-1 TK gene. The results indicate that uptake of these compounds in KBALB-STK cells is variable and highly dependent on the nature of the sugar 2'-substituent. When a fluoro (12) or a hydroxy (13) substituent is present in the arabinofuranosyl (up) configuration at the 2'-position, there is diminished cellular uptake in KBALB-STK cells relative to hydrogen (10) or fluorine (11) in the ribofuranosyl (down) configuration at the 2'-position.

The northern part of Turkey, where the city of Bursa is located, is presumed to be more influenced by the nuclear catastrophe. The radioactive elements in the atmosphere have been examined at various intervals after May 1, 1986 and barium-140 and lanthanum-140, fission agents of uranium-235, have been found in the atmosphere. Their exact concentration could not be measured. The aim of this report is to review the pediatric malignancies diagnosed in our institution between 1986 and 1995, with a view on any significant increase in the number of these cases. The patients were divided into three groups: acute leukemia patients (101 cases), lymphomas (44 cases), and solid tumors (31 cases). All three groups showed a tendency to increase after 1986; the increase in leukemia cases between 1986 and 1995 was found to be significantly higher (p < 0.001) when compared with the years before 1986. The increase in lymphoma and solid tumor cases after 1986 was not found to be significant (p > 0.05). We cannot rule out environmental causes other than the effects of the Chernobyl accident, and we feel that more intense epidemiological studies should be carried out on this subject in other areas of Turkey.","['Gunay, U', 'Meral, A', 'Sevinir, B']","['Gunay U', 'Meral A', 'Sevinir B']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Uludag University Medical School, Bursa, Turkey.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Environ Pathol Toxicol Oncol,"Journal of environmental pathology, toxicology and oncology : official organ of the International Society for Environmental Toxicology and Cancer",8501420,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Child', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/epidemiology', 'Lymphoma/*epidemiology', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/epidemiology', 'Power Plants', 'Radioactive Hazard Release', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Turkey/epidemiology', 'Ukraine']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Environ Pathol Toxicol Oncol. 1996;15(2-4):263-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While the capacity to bind dye molecules appears to be the major determinant of a cell's susceptibility of MC540-mediated PDT, we here present evidence that under certain experimental conditions a cell's capacity to repair MC540-mediated photodynamic damage is also an important factor. Two parameters, temperature and intracellular glutathione (GSH) content, were varied to investigate the role of cellular defense mechanisms in the dye-sensitized photoinactivation of normal murine granulocyte/macrophage progenitors (CFU-GM) and K562, L1210, and melphalan-resistant L1210/L-PAM1 leukemia cells. When exposed to MC540 and light at room temperature, the three leukemia cell lines bound similar amounts of dye and accumulated similar amounts of lipid hydroperoxide (LOOH) but differed markedly in their sensitivity to MC540-mediated PDT. Performing MC540-mediated PDT at 4 degrees C instead of at room temperature reduced dye binding and LOOH generation and enhanced cytotoxicity in some but not all cell lines. A brief (< or = 120 minutes) incubation at 37 degrees C immediately following MC540-mediated PDT accelerated the decay of LOOH in all leukemic cell lines and reduced cell kill by about 2 log in both CFU-GM and leukemia cells. The effect of post-PDT incubation at 37 degrees C on LOOH decay was most pronounced in K562 and least pronounced in L1210/L-PAM1 cells, whereas its effect on cell survival was less pronounced in L1210 cells than in the remaining cell types. L1210/L-PAM1 cells whose GSH content had been reduced from 8.2 to 1.6 micrograms/mg protein by incubation with buthionine sulfoximine recovered from potentially lethal photodynamic damage as rapidly as untreated L1210/L-PAM1 cells and more rapidly than wild-type L1210 cells with a GSH content of 4.5 micrograms/mg protein. Thus, with regard to capacity of L1210/L-PAM1 cells to recover from photodynamic damage, the cells' enhanced capacity to synthesize GSH appeared more decisive than intracellular GSH levels per se. Taken together, these data suggest that temperature-dependent cellular defense mechanisms are significant determinants of a cell's susceptibility to MC540-mediated PDT. The data emphasize the need for temperature control during and immediately after the photochemical purging of autologous bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cells.","['Yamazaki, T', 'Sato, Y', 'Sieber, F']","['Yamazaki T', 'Sato Y', 'Sieber F']","[""Department of Pediatrics, Midwest Children's Cancer Center, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee 53226, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Lipid Peroxides)', '0 (Pyrimidinones)', '58823-12-4 (merocyanine dye)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/*drug effects', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Bone Marrow Purging/*methods', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*pathology', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Repair', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia L1210', 'Lipid Peroxides/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Photochemotherapy', 'Pyrimidinones/*pharmacology', 'Temperature', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/07/01 00:00,1997/07/01 00:01,['1997/07/01 00:00'],"['1997/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1997 Jul;25(7):629-37.,,,['CA49089/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, evidence is presented that this antigen exhibits catalytic activity as measured by the reductive degradation of insulin (release of A chain molecules) on intact B cells in patients suffering from B-CLL, as well as on JVM 13 cells (B-CLL cell line). More than 98% of these cells exhibited PDI activity which could be inhibited by bacitracin and also by monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies to PDI. Interestingly, surface PDI expression was strongly correlated in our study with protein-bound membrane SH groups. These surface protein thiols were specifically determined by using low concentrations of the chloromethyl-derivative based fluorescent probe 5-(and6)-(((4-chloromethyl)-benzoyl)amino)-tetramethyl-rhodamine (CMTMR) at low temperature in the presence of sodium azide in flow cytometry. The highest PDI and SH expression was found on B lymphocytes, particularly B-CLL cells. The mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of CMTMR-positive B cells in the B-CLL line was up to 10-fold higher than that of controls, indicating a strong elevation of cell membrane-located protein thiols on malignant B cells. The link between PDI and SH expression on cell surfaces points to a functional interaction between the two. Treatment with bacitracin resulted in a strong inhibition of PDI and a dramatic increase in surface protein thiol expression of B-CLL cells. Similar effects could be observed by cell treatment with anti-PDI antibodies, indicating that this enzyme system plays a crucial role in the regulation of protein-bound SH groups. Interestingly, artificially induced protein thiol expression led to significantly higher cellular resistance to the cytostatic drugs chlorambucil, vinblastin, and cisplatin in vitro as measured by cell growth. These data suggest for the first time a regulatory effect of PDI on the surface protein thiol status of B cells. The increased expression of PDI may play a crucial role in SH-mediated protection and drug resistance in malignant B lymphocytes.","['Tager, M', 'Kroning, H', 'Thiel, U', 'Ansorge, S']","['Tager M', 'Kroning H', 'Thiel U', 'Ansorge S']","['Institute of Experimental Internal Medicine, Otto-von-Guericke University of Magdeburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Sulfhydryl Compounds)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '1405-87-4 (Bacitracin)', '18D0SL7309 (Chlorambucil)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', 'EC 5.- (Isomerases)', 'EC 5.3.4.1 (Protein Disulfide-Isomerases)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Bacitracin/pharmacology', 'Chlorambucil/pharmacology', 'Cisplatin/pharmacology', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Isomerases/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/enzymology', 'Protein Disulfide-Isomerases', 'Sulfhydryl Compounds/*metabolism', 'Surface Properties', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vinblastine/pharmacology']",1997/07/01 00:00,1997/07/01 00:01,['1997/07/01 00:00'],"['1997/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1997 Jul;25(7):601-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Twenty-seven patients (T-LBL:20 and B-LBL:7) had adequate clinical information and formed the basis of final analysis. Pertinent characteristics, including sex, age, and lymphoma stages of these two groups of patients were identical. Detailed clinical features were compared. Systemic involvements of lymphoma were similar except that T-cell LBL had significantly more mediastinal involvement (T:B = 70%:14.3%, p = 0.011). CNS involvement was high in both groups (T:B = 50%:28.6%, p = NS). B-cell LBL had a better overall survival than T-cell LBL, although the survival benefit became less significant after 30 months. The median survival of T- and B-cell LBL was 8 and 31 months, respectively. Both groups taken together, patients who had received prophylactic cranial irradiation had a better overall survival (p < 0.01). We suggest that: a) B-cell LBL has a relatively favorable prognosis than T-cell LBL, at least in the initial 2 to 3 years; b) except for mediastinal involvement, the clinical presentation of T- and B-cell LBL appears to be similar; c) treatment policy, such as the need of prophylactic cranial irradiation, of these two groups may also be similar.","['Yeh, K H', 'Cheng, A L', 'Su, I J', 'Lin, M T', 'Tien, H F', 'Shen, M C', 'Wang, C H', 'Chen, Y C']","['Yeh KH', 'Cheng AL', 'Su IJ', 'Lin MT', 'Tien HF', 'Shen MC', 'Wang CH', 'Chen YC']","['Department of Oncology, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,,IM,"['Adult', 'Brain Neoplasms/prevention & control', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping/methods', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*immunology/mortality/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/*immunology/mortality/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*immunology/mortality/*pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Radiotherapy/methods', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate']",1997/05/01 00:00,1997/05/01 00:01,['1997/05/01 00:00'],"['1997/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Res. 1997 May-Jun;17(3C):2269-72.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This regression was caused by immunological mechanisms, because the tumor cells were renogenized. In this study, we have tried to find out whether tumor-associated antigen (TAA) expression in these xenogenized tumor cells can be modulated by xenogenization. FV-KMT-17 cells (1 x 10(7)), which were subcutaneously transplanted into ten rats, spontaneously regressed after temporary growth. All rats which rejected FV-KMT-17 cells showed strong resistance to rechallenge with KMT-17 (1 x 10(6)) cells. To reveal the chronological modulation of TAA and virus-associated antigen (VAA), a single-cell suspension was obtained from the subcutaneous tumors and expression of these antigens was chronologically measured. TAA, termed CE7 antigen, was examined by anti-CE7 monoclonal antibody (MoAb) and VAA was examined by anti-FK1 MoAb which recognizes the FV env gene product (gp 70). Expression of VAA was not modulated through either the progression or the regression phase, but expression of TAA was strongly enhanced in the regression phase. These results show that enhancement of TAA expression occurs during the regression phase of FV-KMT-17 growth in vivo and that TAA-expressing cells may stimulate anti-tumor immunity, resulting in acquisition of resistance against parental KMT-17 cells.","['Shibata, T', 'Micallef, M', 'Chiba, I', 'Arisue, M', 'Hosokawa, M', 'Okada, F', 'Takeichi, N', 'Kobayashi, H']","['Shibata T', 'Micallef M', 'Chiba I', 'Arisue M', 'Hosokawa M', 'Okada F', 'Takeichi N', 'Kobayashi H']","['Second Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, School of Dentistry, Health Sciences University of Hokkaido, Japan. tshibata@ccmsl.hucc.hokudai.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*biosynthesis', 'Antigens, Viral/*biosynthesis', 'Female', 'Fibrosarcoma/immunology/*pathology', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Mutagenesis', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar']",1997/05/01 00:00,1997/05/01 00:01,['1997/05/01 00:00'],"['1997/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Res. 1997 May-Jun;17(3C):2135-40.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The main objectives were to extend the evaluation of the health effects of employment in the nuclear industry in Oak Ridge to include most workers who were omitted from earlier studies, to compare the mortality experience of workers among the facilities, to address methodological problems that occur when individuals employed at more than one facility are included in the analysis, and to conduct dose-response analyses for those individuals with potential exposure to external radiation. All-cause mortality and all-cancer mortality were in close agreement with national rates. The only notable excesses occurred for white males for lung cancer [standardized mortality ratio (SMR) = 1.18, 1,849 deaths] and non-malignant respiratory disease (SMR = 1.12, 1,568 deaths). A more detailed analysis revealed substantial differences in death rates among workers at the Oak Ridge plants. Evaluation of internally adjusted log SMRs using Poisson regression showed that workers employed only at Tennessee Eastman Corporation or K-25 and at multiple facilities had higher death rates than similar workers employed only at X-10 or Y-12, and that the differences were primarily due to non-cancer causes. Analysis of selected cancer causes for white males indicated large differences among the workers at the different facilities for lung cancer, leukemia and other lymphatic cancer. Dose-response analyses for external penetrating radiation were limited to a subcohort of 28,347 white males employed at X-10 or Y-12. Their collective recorded dose equivalent was 376 Sv. There was a strong ""healthy worker effect"" in this subcohort-all-cause SMR = 0.80 (4,786 deaths) and all-cancer SMR = 0.87 (1,134 deaths). Variables included in the analyses were age, birth cohort, a measure of socioeconomic status, length of employment, internal radiation exposure potential and facility. For external radiation dose with a 10-year lag, the excess relative risk was 0.31 per Sv (95% CI = -0.16, 1.01) for all causes and 1.45 per Sv (95% CI = 0.15, 3.48) for all cancer. The estimated excess relative risk for leukemia was negative but imprecisely determined. A preliminary dose adjustment procedure was developed to compensate for missing dose but not other dosimetry errors. Results of the analyses using the adjusted doses suggest that the effect of missing dose is an upward bias in dose-response coefficients and test statistics.","['Frome, E L', 'Cragle, D L', 'Watkins, J P', 'Wing, S', 'Shy, C M', 'Tankersley, W G', 'West, C M']","['Frome EL', 'Cragle DL', 'Watkins JP', 'Wing S', 'Shy CM', 'Tankersley WG', 'West CM']","['Mathematical Sciences Section, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Tennessee 37831-6367, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Radiat Res,Radiation research,0401245,,IM,"['Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Female', 'Government Agencies', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*mortality', '*Occupational Diseases', '*Occupational Exposure', 'Risk', 'Tennessee', 'Time Factors']",1997/07/01 00:00,1997/07/01 00:01,['1997/07/01 00:00'],"['1997/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Radiat Res. 1997 Jul;148(1):64-80.,,,,,,,,,,,,,['Radiat Res 1997 Sep;148(3):297-8'],,,,,,

During the first few years of Mayak's operation, almost 30,000 people living on the banks of the Techa River received significant internal and external exposures as a consequence of the release of large quantities of radioactive materials from Mayak. Studies of levels of radioactive contamination and health effects in this population began in the early 1950s. A systematic follow-up of a fixed cohort that includes all people who were living in Techa River villages in 1949 was begun about 30 years ago. In this paper we describe the Techa River cohort, outline the nature of the exposures and discuss the status of follow-up for the period from 1950 through 1989. While noting the limitations of the current epidemiological follow-up data, we also compare the demographic and mortality structure of the Techa River cohort with the Life Span Study cohort of Japanese atomic bomb survivors. It is seen that, despite a number of limitations, the current data suggest that the risks of mortality from leukemia and other cancers increase with increasing radiation dose in the Techa River cohort. This finding suggests that, with continued improvements in the quality of the follow-up and dosimetry, the Techa River cohort has the potential to provide quantitative estimates of the risks of chronic low-dose-rate radiation exposures for an unselected general population that will be an important complement to the estimates based on the Life Span Study that are used as the primary basis for numerical assessments of radiation risk.","['Kossenko, M M', 'Degteva, M O', 'Vyushkova, O V', 'Preston, D L', 'Mabuchi, K', 'Kozheurov, V P']","['Kossenko MM', 'Degteva MO', 'Vyushkova OV', 'Preston DL', 'Mabuchi K', 'Kozheurov VP']","['Department of Epidemiology, Urals Research Center for Radiation Medicine, Medgorodok, Russian Federation.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Radiat Res,Radiation research,0401245,"['0 (Water Pollutants, Radioactive)', '53023GN24M (Plutonium)']",IM,"['Environmental Exposure', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/epidemiology/*etiology/mortality', '*Nuclear Warfare', 'Plutonium/*toxicity', '*Radioactive Hazard Release', 'Risk Assessment', 'Russia', 'Sex Factors', 'Water Pollutants, Radioactive/*toxicity']",1997/07/01 00:00,1997/07/01 00:01,['1997/07/01 00:00'],"['1997/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Radiat Res. 1997 Jul;148(1):54-63.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Additionally, the subtype of leukemia based on the degree of differentiation and cell maturity influence prognosis, response to treatment, and median survival times. In this paper, we analyze immunophenotype flow cytometry data toward categorization of leukemia into subcategories based on lineage and differentiation antigen expression. Twenty-eight inputs (derived from the mean fluorescence intensity of up to 27 antibodies, and an additional binary input denoting the past diagnosis of leukemia) are used as input to a neural classifier to categorize a total of 170 cases into the lineage and differentiation categories of leukemia. The neural classifier consisted of a feed forward network trained using back propagation. A complexity regulation term (weight decay) was used to improve the generalization performance of the neural classifier. A training error of 0.0% and a generalization error of 10.3% was obtained for categorization based on lineage, while a training error of 0.0% and a generalization error of 10.0% was obtained for categorization based on differentiation.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A decision-analysis model that involved a multistate Markov process was designed to estimate the expected cost and quality-adjusted life expectancies for two cohorts of patients to be administered conventional chemotherapy or IFN alpha. Two IFN alpha strategies were modeled: prolonged treatment for patients who achieved a hematologic response (scenario A) or only for patients who achieved a cytogenetic remission in a 2-year period (scenario B). Data on response and transition probabilities between health states were obtained from the literature by a MEDLINE search and pooled with a meta-analytic method. Costs were based on local charges. Expected survival was adjusted for quality of life on the basis of an expert panel judgment. RESULTS: Baseline analysis showed IFN alpha treatment to increase the quality-adjusted life expectancy by 15.5 and 12.5 months relative to conventional chemotherapy, in scenarios A and B, respectively. Marginal cost-effectiveness was $89,500 and $63,500 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. Sensitivity analysis confirmed IFN alpha as the most effective approach. Cost-effectiveness results were sensitive to the cost of IFN alpha therapy and to the assumptions about the rate of cytogenetic remission. Reducing the drug dose, as suggested by a recent report, would decrease the marginal cost-effectiveness to less than $20,000. CONCLUSION: IFN alpha is substantially superior to conventional chemotherapy in terms of quality-adjusted survival, but, at the current doses, marginal cost-effectiveness ranges from $50,000 to $100,000 per QALY gained under most of our assumptions.","['Liberato, N L', 'Quaglini, S', 'Barosi, G']","['Liberato NL', 'Quaglini S', 'Barosi G']","['Laboratory of Medical Informatics, Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico Policlinico S.

We report here promising results with the use of a genetically reshaped human CD52 antibody, CAMPATH-1H. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifteen patients with T-PLL, most of whom had received the purine analog deoxycoformycin (DCF), were treated with CAMPATH-1H. Results were compared with those of 25 patients treated with DCF. RESULTS: Major responses occurred in 11 patients (73%) treated with CAMPATH-1H compared with 40% with DCF. Complete remissions (CRs) were documented in nine (60%) of the CAMPATH-1H cases and only three (12%) were obtained with DCF. CRs with CAMPATH-1H were durable, and re-treatment with the antibody resulted in second CRs in three relapsed patients. Two of them were successfully autografted with peripheral-blood and bone marrow stem cells collected during the first CR. Apart from first-dose reactions, infusions of CAMPATH-1H were well tolerated. However, two responding patients developed severe bone marrow aplasia that was fatal in one; the second remained moderately pancytopenic 21 weeks after stopping CAMPATH-1H therapy. The cause of this adverse effect is unknown. CONCLUSION: CAMPATH-1H is an effective agent in T-PLL and represents a significant improvement over other types of therapy. However, CAMPATH-1H alone is not sufficient for long-term remissions, and the role of autologous stem-cell transplantation needs further investigation.","['Pawson, R', 'Dyer, M J', 'Barge, R', 'Matutes, E', 'Thornton, P D', 'Emmett, E', 'Kluin-Nelemans, J C', 'Fibbe, W E', 'Willemze, R', 'Catovsky, D']","['Pawson R', 'Dyer MJ', 'Barge R', 'Matutes E', 'Thornton PD', 'Emmett E', 'Kluin-Nelemans JC', 'Fibbe WE', 'Willemze R', 'Catovsky D']","['Academic Department of Hematology and Cytogenetics, Royal Marsden Hospital, London, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '3A189DH42V (Alemtuzumab)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Alemtuzumab', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Prolymphocytic/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recurrence', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",1997/07/01 00:00,1997/07/01 00:01,['1997/07/01 00:00'],"['1997/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1997.15.7.2667 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1997 Jul;15(7):2667-72. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1997.15.7.2667.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because cytogenetics play a dominant role in the outcome of patients with acute leukemia, their prognostic value was evaluated in a large group of newly diagnosed and previously treated myeloma patients receiving autotransplants. METHODS: A total of 427 either newly diagnosed (26%) or previously treated patients (74%) received tandem transplants, supported by mobilized peripheral-blood stem cells. Numerous variables, including cytogenetics, were analyzed for their impact on complete remission, event-free survival (EFS), and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: Abnormal karyotypes were detected in 37% of our patients and were very complex, irrespective of the duration of standard therapy before the first autotransplant. In addition to previously recognized unfavorable implications of partial or complete deletion of chromosome 13 and 11q abnormalities, we now observed that the presence of any translocation likewise portended poor outcome (unfavorable karyotypes). On multivariate analysis, the absence of an unfavorable karyotype was the most favorable variable for both EFS (P = .0001) and OS (P = .0001). Other favorable factors were duration of standard therapy and a low beta-2 microglobulin (B2M) level before the first autotransplant. A risk-based classification system was developed according to the number of these favorable variables present, showing highly significant differences in event-free and overall survival. CONCLUSION: Cytogenetics play a dominant role in myeloma and were independent of previously recognized important prognostic factors, such as B2M and duration of prior standard therapy.","['Tricot, G', 'Sawyer, J R', 'Jagannath, S', 'Desikan, K R', 'Siegel, D', 'Naucke, S', 'Mattox, S', 'Bracy, D', 'Munshi, N', 'Barlogie, B']","['Tricot G', 'Sawyer JR', 'Jagannath S', 'Desikan KR', 'Siegel D', 'Naucke S', 'Mattox S', 'Bracy D', 'Munshi N', 'Barlogie B']","['Department of Pathology, Arkansas Cancer Research Center and University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Combined Modality Therapy', '*Cytogenetics', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/drug therapy/*genetics/*therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Analysis', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",1997/07/01 00:00,1997/07/01 00:01,['1997/07/01 00:00'],"['1997/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1997.15.7.2659 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1997 Jul;15(7):2659-66. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1997.15.7.2659.,,,"['CA55819/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA59340/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The increasingly competitive health care marketplace raises concerns about patient access to costly medical procedures such as BMT. We attempted to evaluate patient access to BMT for the treatment of leukemias and lymphomas. METHODS: We analyzed inpatient hospital discharge data from four states (California, Maryland, Massachusetts, and New York) for 2 years (1988 and 1991) to examine whether the use of BMT for patients with either leukemia or lymphoma varies by sociodemographic characteristics and insurance coverage. We developed a sorting algorithm to collapse the discharge data into patient level records. We used logistic regression to analyze the odds of receiving a BMT stratified by disease type (leukemia or lymphoma). RESULTS: After controlling for other factors, black patients with leukemia are 51% to 53% as likely as whites, while black patients with lymphoma are 34% to 45% as likely as white patients to undergo a BMT (P < .05). Medicaid, self-pay patients, and Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) enrollees with either leukemia or lymphoma are significantly less likely to undergo a BMT compared with patients with private insurance. Younger patients are significantly more predisposed to undergo a BMT than older patients. The odds of receiving a BMT have increased over time, but the rates of increase vary by state. Consistent with clinical expectations, the relative odds of BMT vary significantly by type of leukemia or lymphoma. CONCLUSION: Substantial variation exists in access to BMT for patients with either leukemia or lymphoma. Black patients, those enrolled in HMOs, those covered by Medicaid, and self-pay patients were less likely to receive a BMT when admitted for either leukemia or lymphoma. These findings raise concerns about access to cancer treatments for patients in the current health care system.","['Mitchell, J M', 'Meehan, K R', 'Kong, J', 'Schulman, K A']","['Mitchell JM', 'Meehan KR', 'Kong J', 'Schulman KA']","['Institute for Health Care Research and Policy, Division of General Internal Medicine, Georgetown University Medical Center, Washington, DC, USA. mitchejm@gunet.georgetown.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,"['African Americans/statistics & numerical data', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'California', 'Health Maintenance Organizations', '*Health Services Accessibility', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Logistic Models', 'Lymphoma/*therapy', 'Maryland', 'Massachusetts', 'Medicaid', 'New York', 'Odds Ratio', '*Socioeconomic Factors', 'United States']",1997/07/01 00:00,1997/07/01 00:01,['1997/07/01 00:00'],"['1997/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1997.15.7.2644 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1997 Jul;15(7):2644-51. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1997.15.7.2644.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 272 consecutive women with high-risk GTT, including 121 previously treated patients, were treated with weekly EMA/CO. The median follow-up duration is 4.5 years (range, 1 to 16). RESULTS: The cumulative 5-year survival rate is 86.2% (95% confidence interval, 81.9% to 90.5%). No deaths from GTT have occurred later than 2 years after the end [corrected] of EMA/CO. In a multivariate model, adverse prognostic factors were the presence of liver metastases (P < .0001), interval from antecedent pregnancy (P < .0001), brain metastases (P = .0008), and term delivery of antecedent pregnancy (P = .045). There were 11 (4%) early deaths, while 213 patients (78%) achieved a complete remission. Forty-seven (17%) developed drug resistance to EMA/CO, of whom 33 (70%) were salvaged by further cisplatin-based chemotherapy and surgery. Two women developed acute myeloid leukemia, two cervical malignancy, and one gastric adenocarcinoma after EMA/CO. More than half (56%) of the women who had fertility-conserving surgery and who have been in remission at least 2 years have become pregnant since the completion of EMA/CO, with 112 live births, including three infants with congenital abnormalities. CONCLUSION: EMA/CO is an effective and well-tolerated regimen for high-risk GTT.

Microsatellite lengths at 55 loci, mapped to eight different mouse chromosomes, were examined in two groups of DNA samples: 1) 10 normal DNA samples collected from the bone marrow cells of control male CBA/Ca mice, and 2) 17 DNA samples isolated from the spleens of mice that developed myeloid leukemia (ML) after exposure to neutrons, or X rays, or gamma rays. Microsatellite markers were amplified using the non-radioisotopic multiplex-touchdown PCR protocols developed in our laboratory, and the sizes of amplicons were examined on 6% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels. Although no correlation between microsatellite length polymorphisms and radiation leukemogenesis was observed at the 55 CBA/Ca mouse loci tested in this study, an uncommon MSI, manifested as the absence of DNA bands after PCR amplification at 2 loci (D2MIT140 and D4MIT104), was observed in both control and ML samples. However, the frequency of ML samples showing this type of MSI is statistically significant (p<0.05). Although there is no direct evidence that this type of MSI predisposes mice to the development of leukemia, the results suggests that genes flanking the D2MIT140 and D4MIT104 are susceptible to spontaneous mutation and perhaps to damage caused by ionizing radiation.","['Rithidech, K N', 'Dunn, J J', 'Gordon, C R', 'Cronkite, E P', 'Bond, V P']","['Rithidech KN', 'Dunn JJ', 'Gordon CR', 'Cronkite EP', 'Bond VP']","['Medical Department, Brookhaven National Laboratory, Upton, NY 11973, USA. rithidech@bnlarm.bnl.gov']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood Cells Mol Dis,"Blood cells, molecules & diseases",9509932,,IM,"['Animals', 'Chromosomes/*chemistry', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/*genetics', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred CBA', '*Microsatellite Repeats', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction']",1997/01/01 00:00,1997/01/01 00:01,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S1079-9796(97)90126-1 [pii]', '10.1006/bcmd.1997.0126 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Cells Mol Dis. 1997;23(1):99-109. doi: 10.1006/bcmd.1997.0126.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

More recently, these vectors have been tested in the clinic as immunotherapeutic agents and anticancer agents. One potential problem with the use of such vectors is the possible development of immune responses directed against the vector particles themselves. Here, we examine immunoglobulin (Ig) responses specific for retroviral vectors derived from murine leukemia virus (MLV). Anti-MLV Ig is seen following intramuscular (i.m.) administration of retroviral vectors in mice, and in nonhuman primates; as expected, these responses are dependent upon the vector dose delivered. Furthermore, serum from vector-treated animals is capable of partially neutralizing vector-mediated transduction of target cells in an in vitro assay. Nevertheless, even in the presence of significant levels of anti-vector Ig in vivo, i.m. administration of retroviral vector is still capable of driving both Ig and cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses specific for vector-encoded gene products. This work suggests that although retroviral vectors may readily induce immune responses directed against the vector particles themselves, such responses will not significantly affect the efficiency of these vectors in an immunotherapeutic protocol.","['McCormack, J E', 'Martineau, D', 'DePolo, N', 'Maifert, S', 'Akbarian, L', 'Townsend, K', 'Lee, W', 'Irwin, M', 'Sajjadi, N', 'Jolly, D J', 'Warner, J']","['McCormack JE', 'Martineau D', 'DePolo N', 'Maifert S', 'Akbarian L', 'Townsend K', 'Lee W', 'Irwin M', 'Sajjadi N', 'Jolly DJ', 'Warner J']","['Chiron Technologies, Center for Gene Therapy, San Diego, CA 92121, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Hum Gene Ther,Human gene therapy,9008950,"['0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Immunoglobulins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'EC 3.2.1.23 (beta-Galactosidase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Genetic Vectors/genetics/*immunology/*pharmacology', 'Immunoblotting', 'Immunoglobulin G/drug effects/metabolism', 'Immunoglobulins/*drug effects/*immunology', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Neutralization Tests', 'Primates', 'Recombinant Proteins/genetics/immunology', 'Retroviridae/*genetics/immunology', 'beta-Galactosidase/genetics/immunology/metabolism']",1997/07/01 00:00,1997/07/01 00:01,['1997/07/01 00:00'],"['1997/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/hum.1997.8.10-1263 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Gene Ther. 1997 Jul 1;8(10):1263-73. doi: 10.1089/hum.1997.8.10-1263.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The vectors are engineered to be replication defective by replacing the structural and nonstructural genes of a cloned infectious retrovirus with a therapeutic gene of interest. The retroviral particles are currently generated in packaging cell lines, which supply all retroviral proteins in trans. Recombination between short homologous regions of the retroviral vector and packaging cell line elements can theoretically generate replication-competent retrovirus (RCR) and hence the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires the monitoring of clinical trial subjects for the presence of RCR. Sensitive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays have been used for the detection of murine leukemia virus (MLV) nucleotide sequences in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). A novel serological enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the detection of anti-MLV specific immunoglobulin (Ig) has been developed to be used as an alternative to the PCR assay. Both assays were used to monitor human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive clinical trial subjects who had received multiple injections of HIV-IT (V), a retroviral vector encoding HIV-1 IIIBenv/rev. Western blot analysis and an in vitro vector neutralization assay were used to characterize further a subset of serum samples tested by ELISA. Results show no evidence of RCR infection in clinical trial subjects. PCR and ELISA assays are discussed in terms of their advantages and limitations as routine screening assays for RCR.

Twenty-four percent of neurons within the L4 and L5 dorsal root ganglia accumulated biotinylated LIF following intraneural injection of the cytokine into the sciatic nerve. Labelled cell bodies were predominantly of small diameter (20.1 +/- 0.5 microm). Retrograde transport was eliminated by excess unlabelled LIF but not by the related cytokines, ciliary-derived neurotrophic factor (CNTF) and interleukin-6 (IL-6). Double labelling revealed that the majority (81%) of LIF-accumulating neurons were immunopositive for CGRP and 34% were immunopositive for the cell surface glycoconjugate IB4. Sixty-two percent of LIF-accumulating neurons were immunopositive for trkA. Our results demonstrate a group of small-diameter sensory neurons that retrogradely transport LIF, comprising cells that constitutively express neuropeptides and those likely to be peptide-deficient. LIF-accumulating neurons expressing trkA are also potentially responsive to nerve growth factor.

In most cell types investigated, the nuclear matrix does not spontaneously resist these extractions, but must rather be stabilized before the application of extracting agents such as high salt solutions or lithium diiodosalicylate. We have examined the effect of two widely used stabilization procedures on the localization of nuclear matrix proteins. Four individual polypeptides were studied, all of which are scaffold or matrix-associated region (S/MAR)-binding proteins: SATB1, SAF-A/hnRNP-U, NuMA , and topoisomerase II alpha. Nuclei were isolated from K562 human erythroleukemia cells in a buffer containing spermine, spermidine, KCl and EDTA, and the nuclear matrix or scaffold was obtained by extraction with lithium diiodosalicylate after stabilization by heat treatment (37 degrees or 42 degrees C) or incubation with Cu2+ ions. When the localization of individual proteins was determined by immunofluorescent staining and confocal scanning laser microscopy, markedly different consequences of the two stabilization strategies became evident, ranging from a total maintenance of the localization (NuMA and topoisomerase II alpha) to a marked redistribution (SATB1 and SAF-A/hnRNP-U).

Innovative, nontoxic approaches to the disease are required. One approach might be therapy with retinoids. Retinoid activities are mediated by two distinct families of transcription factors: the retinoic acid receptors (RARs) and retinoid X receptors (RXRs), which can induce transcriptional activation through specific DNA sites or by inhibiting the transcription factor AP-1 that usually mediates cellular proliferative signals. The RARs require heterodimerization with RXRs. RXRs can form either heterodimers or homodimers; and the latter can bind to DNA response elements that are distinct from those bound by the RAR/RXR heterodimers. METHODS: A series of novel synthetic retinoids that selectively interact with RXR/RXR homodimers or RAR/RXR heterodimers, or that selectively inhibit AP-1 activity without activating transcription were evaluated for their ability to inhibit clonal growth of three human prostate cancer cell lines (PC-3, DU-145, and LNCaP). RESULTS: Several notable findings were: 1) RXR-selective retinoids, such as SR11246, were able to inhibit the clonal growth of prostate cancer cells. In contrast, SR11246 had little effect on clonal growth of myeloid leukemic cells. 2) RAR-selective retinoids also inhibited clonal growth of prostate cancer cells. 3) The retinoid (SR11238) with potent anti-AP-1 activity had no effect on the clonal growth of prostate cancer cells. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that both RXR- and RAR-selective retinoids are worthy of further study and may be candidates for future clinical trials in prostate cancer.","['de Vos, S', 'Dawson, M I', 'Holden, S', 'Le, T', 'Wang, A', 'Cho, S K', 'Chen, D L', 'Koeffler, H P']","['de Vos S', 'Dawson MI', 'Holden S', 'Le T', 'Wang A', 'Cho SK', 'Chen DL', 'Koeffler HP']","['Division of Hemotology/Oncology, UCLA School of Medicine 90048, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Prostate,The Prostate,8101368,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoid X Receptors)', '0 (Retinoids)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-1)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Dimerization', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', 'Male', 'Molecular Structure', 'Prostatic Neoplasms', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Retinoid X Receptors', 'Retinoids/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Transcription Factor AP-1/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Transcription Factors/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/07/01 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1997/07/01 00:00'],"['1997/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1997/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0045(19970701)32:2<115::AID-PROS6>3.0.CO;2-L [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1097-0045(19970701)32:2<115::aid-pros6>3.0.co;2-l [doi]']",ppublish,Prostate. 1997 Jul 1;32(2):115-21. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1097-0045(19970701)32:2<115::aid-pros6>3.0.co;2-l.,,,"['CA-26038/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-42710/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-43277/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A more complex problem is immunosuppressed patients who have undergone bone marrow transplantation. For a prolonged period, they are both neutropenic and thrombocytopenic. Survival in these patients is poor, and the role for extensive surgical intervention for sinus disease has to be weighed against the risk and the potential that this is a systemic disease. Between January 1983 and June 1993, 29 bone marrow transplant recipients with documented invasive fungal infections of the sinuses and paranasal tissues required surgical intervention. This represents 1.7% of the total 1692 bone marrow transplants performed. There were 22 allogeneic, 6 autologous, and 3 unrelated donor transplants, with two patients receiving two separate grafts. Underlying diseases included 24 hematologic malignancies and 5 other disorders, including 1 aplastic anemia and 1 solid tumor. The mortality rate from the initial fungal infection was 62%. Twenty-seven percent resolved the initial infections but subsequently died of other causes. All patients received medical management, such as amphotericin, rifampin, and colony-stimulating factors, in addition to surgical intervention. Surgical management ranged from minimally invasive procedures to extensive resections including medial maxillectomies. Sixty-one percent of the patients who died of the initial infection had undergone extensive surgical procedures versus 55% of those who resolved the infection. Recovery of neutrophil counts was required to clear the infection but did not necessarily predict a good outcome because 50% of those who died of the infection had experienced neutrophil recovery. White blood cell counts at the time of surgery were not significantly different between the two groups. Prognosis was poor when cranial and orbital involvement and/or bony erosion occurred.","['Kennedy, C A', 'Adams, G L', 'Neglia, J P', 'Giebink, G S']","['Kennedy CA', 'Adams GL', 'Neglia JP', 'Giebink GS']","['University of Minnesota, Minneapolis 55455, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,Otolaryngology--head and neck surgery : official journal of American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery,8508176,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Immunocompromised Host', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/complications/surgery', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications/surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mycoses/immunology/*surgery', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/surgery', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sinusitis/complications/immunology/microbiology/*surgery']",1997/06/01 00:00,1997/06/01 00:01,['1997/06/01 00:00'],"['1997/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0194599897001447 [pii]', '10.1016/S0194-59989770236-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg. 1997 Jun;116(6 Pt 1):610-6. doi: 10.1016/S0194-59989770236-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study evaluated a tyramide enhanced avidin-biotin immunostaining method on formalin fixed decalcified BMT sections to determine whether the method could detect previously undetectable antigens. METHODS: Nineteen BMT biopsies from a range of haematological disorders were evaluated with 43 antibodies to haemopoietic antigens using horseradish peroxidase and alkaline phosphatase detection methods, using the tyramide enhanced avidin-biotin immunostaining method. RESULTS: Compared with standard avidin-biotin immunostaining methods the tyramide enhanced immunostaining method showed enhanced signal intensity, gave positive labelling for antigens that require pretreatment by other methods, and previously unreactive antigens were detected. Primary antibodies could be used at up to 200 times higher dilutions. CONCLUSION: The tyramide enhanced immunostaining method, while retaining specificity, is highly sensitive and enables an increased number and range of antigens to be detected than previously possible. The method could be applied to BMT sections for the routine diagnosis and classification of haematological disorders.","['Erber, W N', 'Willis, J I', 'Hoffman, G J']","['Erber WN', 'Willis JI', 'Hoffman GJ']","['Haematology Department, Royal Perth Hospital, Australia. wenderbe@dunamis.rph.uwa.edu.au']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Controlled Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",England,J Clin Pathol,Journal of clinical pathology,0376601,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Biopsy', 'Bone Marrow/*immunology', 'Hematologic Diseases/*diagnosis/immunology', 'Histocytological Preparation Techniques', 'Humans', '*Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/metabolism', 'Staining and Labeling/methods']",1997/05/01 00:00,1997/05/01 00:01,['1997/05/01 00:00'],"['1997/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/jcp.50.5.389 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Pathol. 1997 May;50(5):389-93. doi: 10.1136/jcp.50.5.389.,,,,,PMC499940,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort analysis. SETTING: Specialist HIV/AIDS service in London. SUBJECTS: 215 consecutive HIV infected patients undergoing 246 BM samplings for investigation of pyrexia without localising signs, haematological abnormalities, or staging/investigation of lymphoma. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Diagnostic yield from (and impact on management of) BM sampling. RESULTS: Of 122 BM samples taken to investigate pyrexia, 33 (27%) revealed the cause on microscopy: unexpected lymphoma in seven (6%), mycobacteriosis in 25 (20%), and toxoplasmosis in one (1%). Marrow infiltration was confirmed in 11 of 38 BM samples taken for staging/investigation of lymphoma/leukaemia. In afebrile patients, of 22 with pancytopenia, BM samples showed HIV associated changes in 17 and specific diagnoses in five (mycobacterial infection in three, haemophagocytic syndrome in one, and megaloblastic change due to vitamin B-12 deficiency in one); of 21 with isolated thrombocytopenia, 20 (95%) BM samples showed immune thrombocytopenic purpura to be the cause and the remaining patient had BM changes of aplasia; of 29 with isolated anaemia, 28 had BM changes of HIV associated dysplasia/erythroid dysplasia and one had unsuspected iron deficiency; all 10 with isolated leucopenia/neutropenia had BM changes ascribed to HIV infection exacerbated by concurrent sepsis or medication; of four BM samples taken for other reasons, one showed mycobacterial infection. CONCLUSIONS: BM sampling has diagnostic utility in HIV infected patients with pyrexia without localising signs, pancytopenia, and staging/investigation of lymphoma; this test has little value in the investigation of afebrile patients with isolated thrombocytopenia, anaemia, or leucopenia as HIV is usually the underlying cause.","['Brook, M G', 'Ayles, H', 'Harrison, C', 'Rowntree, C', 'Miller, R F']","['Brook MG', 'Ayles H', 'Harrison C', 'Rowntree C', 'Miller RF']","['Mortimer Market Centre, Camden and Islington Community Health Services (NHS), London.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Genitourin Med,Genitourinary medicine,8503853,,IM,"['AIDS-Related Opportunistic Infections/diagnosis', 'Adult', 'Anemia/diagnosis', 'Bone Marrow Examination/*standards', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Fever/etiology', 'HIV Infections/*diagnosis', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/diagnosis', 'Humans', 'Leukopenia/diagnosis', 'Male', 'Mycobacterium Infections/diagnosis', 'Pancytopenia/diagnosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Thrombocytopenia/diagnosis', 'Toxoplasmosis']",1997/04/01 00:00,1997/04/01 00:01,['1997/04/01 00:00'],"['1997/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/sti.73.2.117 [doi]'],ppublish,Genitourin Med. 1997 Apr;73(2):117-21. doi: 10.1136/sti.73.2.117.,,,,['Genitourin Med. 1997 Apr;73(2):85-6.

Furthermore, childhood ALL has been suggested to be linked to patterns of infection during infancy. PURPOSE: To explore these hypotheses and other associations, we studied the impact of sibling patterns (e.g., birth order) and birth characteristics (e.g., birth weight) on the risk of childhood ALL and AML. METHODS: By linkage of records of population-based registries, a cohort of all children whose mothers were born in Denmark from April 1935 through March 1978 was established. Children who developed ALL or AML during the period from April 1968 through December 1992 were identified by linkage with the Danish Cancer Registry. Birth weights were obtained for children born during the period from January 1973 through December 1992 by linkage with the Medical Birth Registry. RESULTS: The cohort of approximately 2.0 million children was followed for the diagnosis of ALL or AML for 20.9 million person-years. A total of 704 cases of childhood ALL were identified. Among 0-4 year olds, the relative risks (RRs) of ALL for birth order positions 1, 2, 3, and 4+ were 1.00 (reference), 0.85 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.68-1.07), 0.91 (95% CI = 0.66-1.25), and 0.57 (95% CI = 0.30-1.06), respectively (P for trend = .09). A decreasing trend was not observed among 5-14 year olds. A significant log-linear association between birth weight and the risk of ALL was observed for both age groups. Overall, the RR of ALL increased by a factor of 1.46 (95% CI = 1.18-1.81) (P = .0005) for each kilogram of increase in birth weight. A total of 114 cases of childhood AML were identified. Children born second or later in the birth order had an increased risk of AML (RR = 1.53; 95% CI = 1.01-2.32) compared with firstborns. A particularly high risk of AML at ages 2 (RR = 2.53; 95% CI = 1.46-4.40) and 3 years was associated with having siblings compared with being an only child at those ages. Similar to the findings for ALL risk, there was a significant association between birth weight and AML risk. The relative increase in AML risk per 1-kg increase in birth weight was 2.14 (95% CI = 1.19-3.85; P = .009). CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: The association between birth weight and childhood leukemia suggests the importance of intrauterine factors. A plausible explanation may be that increasing birth weight is associated with a higher rate of cell proliferation and/or a larger number of precursor cells being at risk of malignant transformation.

We now show that in erythroid cells Lmo2 forms a novel DNA-binding complex, with GATA-1, TAL1 and E2A, and the recently identified LIM-binding protein Ldb1/NLI. This oligomeric complex binds to a unique, bipartite DNA motif comprising an E-box, CAGGTG, followed approximately 9 bp downstream by a GATA site. In vivo assembly of the DNA-binding complex requires interaction of all five proteins and establishes a transcriptional transactivating complex. These data demonstrate one function for the LIM-binding protein Ldb1 and establish a function for the LIM-only protein Lmo2 as an obligatory component of an oligomeric, DNA-binding complex which may play a role in haematopoiesis.","['Wadman, I A', 'Osada, H', 'Grutz, G G', 'Agulnick, A D', 'Westphal, H', 'Forster, A', 'Rabbitts, T H']","['Wadman IA', 'Osada H', 'Grutz GG', 'Agulnick AD', 'Westphal H', 'Forster A', 'Rabbitts TH']","['MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors)', '0 (LDB1 protein, human)', '0 (LIM Domain Proteins)', '0 (Lmo2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Metalloproteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (TCF Transcription Factors)', '0 (TCF7L1 protein, human)', '0 (Tal1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Tcf7l1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factor 7-Like 1 Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Animals', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors', 'Binding Sites', 'COS Cells', 'Consensus Sequence', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Hematopoiesis/*genetics', 'LIM Domain Proteins', 'Metalloproteins/metabolism', 'Models, Genetic', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'TCF Transcription Factors', 'Transcription Factor 7-Like 1 Protein', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', '*Transcription, Genetic', '*Transcriptional Activation', 'Transfection']",1997/06/02 00:00,1997/06/02 00:01,['1997/06/02 00:00'],"['1997/06/02 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/06/02 00:01 [medline]', '1997/06/02 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/emboj/16.11.3145 [doi]'],ppublish,EMBO J. 1997 Jun 2;16(11):3145-57. doi: 10.1093/emboj/16.11.3145.,,,,,PMC1169933,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PML, which is concentrated in nuclear bodies (PML bodies), has been shown to have growth- and transformation-suppressive properties. In this study, we have examined the intranuclear distribution of PML in a conditionally immortalized human cell line (IDH4) in which both proliferation and immortalization are dependent on the presence of SV40-encoded large T-antigen (SV40T). Expression of SV40T is controlled by a dexamethasone (Dex)-inducible promotor. Suppression of SV40DT (Dex removal) in IDH4 cells causes G1 arrest and expression of the senescent phenotype. This is accompanied by a redistribution of PML in most cells from the usual pattern containing only spherical bodies to a pattern, containing large doughnut-like or fiber-like structures in addition to the spherical bodies. This change in pattern is reversed when phenotypically senescent IDH4 cells are stimulated to proliferate again by SV40T-induction. Moreover, we find that there is a similar change in the PML pattern between young and senescent or serum-starved young IMR90 human fibroblasts, from which IDH4 cells are derived. However, fewer serum-starved cells contain large PML bodies than senescent cells. Our observations suggest senescence, although it may be partly related to growth arrest. Using three-dimensional fluorescence digital imaging microscopy, we have found that the apparently doughnut-like PML structures have a cylindrical or egg-shaped form and that PML is concentrated to the outer shell of the structure.","['Jiang, W Q', 'Ringertz, N']","['Jiang WQ', 'Ringertz N']","['Department of Cell and Molecular Biology, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cell Growth Differ,Cell growth & differentiation : the molecular biology journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9100024,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)']",IM,"['Cell Division', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Cytoplasmic Granules/metabolism/*ultrastructure', 'Fibroblasts/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Humans', '*Neoplasm Proteins', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Simian virus 40', 'Transcription Factors/*analysis/ultrastructure', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",1997/05/01 00:00,1997/05/01 00:01,['1997/05/01 00:00'],"['1997/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cell Growth Differ. 1997 May;8(5):513-22.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In 1991, the incidence in children from Mexico City (MC) was 70 (x 10(6) child/year), although this rate might be underestimated. The aim of the present study was to estimate the incidence of malignant neoplasms in children resident in MC attending Social Security (SS) hospitals. This study was a retrospective hospital survey. All records of childhood malignant neoplasms diagnosed between 1992 and 1993 in the two SS hospitals which attend childhood neoplasms in MC were reviewed. Histopathological diagnoses were reevaluated and incidence rates (x 10(6) child/ year) in terms of age, sex, and place of residence were estimated. A total of 667 cases were found for the period of study, of which 199 corresponded to residents of MC. The neoplasms with highest prevalence were leukemias (39.2%), lymphomas (17.6%), and central nervous system tumors (12.6%). A general incidence of 94.3 was found, which was highest in children under 5 years of age. Leukemias had an incidence of 36.4, lymphomas of 15.2, and central nervous system tumors of 12.0. Prevalence was higher in boys (male/female ratio of 1.6). As for the place of residence, the highest incidence corresponded to children living in the southern areas of MC. Eighty percent of the leukemias were acute lymphoblastic, while 54% of solid neoplasms were classified as stages III and IV. In conclusion, the incidence of malignant neoplasms in children resident in MC treated at SS hospitals is consistent with that found worldwide, and also with the Latin American pattern.","['Fajardo-Gutierrez, A', 'Navarrete-Martinez, A', 'Reynoso-Garcia, M', 'Zarzosa-Morales, M E', 'Mejia-Arangure, M', 'Yamamoto-Kimura, L T']","['Fajardo-Gutierrez A', 'Navarrete-Martinez A', 'Reynoso-Garcia M', 'Zarzosa-Morales ME', 'Mejia-Arangure M', 'Yamamoto-Kimura LT']","['Unidad de Investigatigacion Medica en Epidemiologia Clinica, Hospital de Pediatria, Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social, Mexico D.F., Mexico.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Med Pediatr Oncol,Medical and pediatric oncology,7506654,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Factors', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Hospitals, Pediatric', 'Hospitals, Special', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Latin America/epidemiology', 'Leukemia/epidemiology', 'Lymphoma/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Medical Oncology', 'Mexico/epidemiology', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/epidemiology', 'Prevalence', 'Residence Characteristics', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sex Factors', 'Social Security']",1997/09/01 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1997/09/01 00:00'],"['1997/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1997/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1096-911X(199709)29:3<208::AID-MPO8>3.0.CO;2-H [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1096-911x(199709)29:3<208::aid-mpo8>3.0.co;2-h [doi]']",ppublish,Med Pediatr Oncol. 1997 Sep;29(3):208-12. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1096-911x(199709)29:3<208::aid-mpo8>3.0.co;2-h.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A study of three classes of antibody and five leucocyte preparation procedures.,175-88,"For patients undergoing stem cell transplantation after intensive marrow ablative therapy it is important to enumerate the CD34+ stem cells in peripheral blood so that the harvest can be timed in order to maximize the number of cells collected by leucophoresis for subsequent haematopoietic reconstitution. The use of rapid flow cytometric techniques for the determination CD34+ leucocyte numbers has been advocated, although there is no consensus as to the best method. In this study, we have examined the effects of preparation procedures for flow cytometry on the binding of four CD34 antibodies (Immu-133, QBEND-10, HPCA2 and BIRMA-K3) to the three classes of epitopes on leucocytes. Whole blood, bone marrow and leucophoresis samples were analysed either directly after labelling with a vital nuclear dye (LDS-751) and fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies or after additional erythrocyte lysis and leucocyte fixation using four commercially available reagents (Q-Prep, OptiLyse B, OptiLyse C and FACS Lysing Solution). By comparison with the results obtained from viable leucocytes in unmanipulated samples, it was found that the binding of all four antibodies could be affected by lysis and fixation procedures and that the binding of the class I antibody Immu-133 was most markedly decreased. We conclude that CD34+ cells are best analysed using a whole blood procedure in which nucleated cells are identified by their side light scatter and the fluorescence associated with a vital nuclear dye (in this instance LDS-751) and the CD34+ cells are detected with fluorescein isothiocyanate- or phycoerythrin-conjugated antibodies.","['Macey, M G', 'McCarthy, D A', 'van Agthoven, A', 'Newland, A C']","['Macey MG', 'McCarthy DA', 'van Agthoven A', 'Newland AC']","['Department of Haematology, Royal London Hospital, Whitechapel, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,J Immunol Methods,Journal of immunological methods,1305440,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies/immunology', 'Antigens, CD34/*analysis', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukapheresis', 'Leukemia/blood/*therapy', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens/analysis', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Mice', 'Reticulocytes/immunology']",1997/05/26 00:00,1997/05/26 00:01,['1997/05/26 00:00'],"['1997/05/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/05/26 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/26 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0022-1759(97)00045-8 [pii]', '10.1016/s0022-1759(97)00045-8 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol Methods. 1997 May 26;204(2):175-88. doi: 10.1016/s0022-1759(97)00045-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On the one hand, the formation of DNA single strand breaks (SSBs) induced by either hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) or tert-butylhydroperoxide (tBu-OOH) was prevented by iron chelators, was not affected by antioxidants or glucose omission before and during peroxide exposure and was enhanced by prior catalase depletion. Furthermore, H2O2- and tBu-OOH-induced DNA strand scission were also detected after treatment at 0 degree C. On the other hand, H2O2, but not tBu-OOH or cumene hydroperoxide (cum-OOH), produced DNA strand scission in isolated nuclei and post-lysed DNA samples. In addition, lowering the basal intracellular calcium concentration with ethylene glycol-bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (EGTA) markedly reduced the DNA-damaging efficiency of tBu-OOH while promoting only a slight decline in the number of DNA SSBs induced by H2O2. Taken together, these results are consistent with the commonly held theory that DNA damage caused by H2O2 is mediated by the formation of hydroxyl radicals. tBu-OOH-induced DNA single strand breakage appears to involve both the formation of H2O2 and a rise in cytosolic calcium ions.","['Guidarelli, A', 'Cattabeni, F', 'Cantoni, O']","['Guidarelli A', 'Cattabeni F', 'Cantoni O']","['Istituto di Farmacologia e Farmacognosia, Universita di Urbino, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Free Radic Res,Free radical research,9423872,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Iron Chelating Agents)', '0 (Peroxides)', '955VYL842B (tert-Butylhydroperoxide)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'EC 1.11.1.6 (Catalase)', 'IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Antioxidants/chemistry', 'Calcium/chemistry', 'Catalase/metabolism', 'Cell Line', '*DNA Damage', 'Glucose/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/*chemistry', 'Iron Chelating Agents/chemistry', 'Peroxides/*chemistry', 'Temperature', 'tert-Butylhydroperoxide']",1997/06/01 00:00,1997/06/01 00:01,['1997/06/01 00:00'],"['1997/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10715769709097825 [doi]'],ppublish,Free Radic Res. 1997 Jun;26(6):537-47. doi: 10.3109/10715769709097825.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Abnormal expression of sFas and mFas is likely to be involved in lymphoproliferative disorders and auto-immune diseases. Adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) caused by human T-cell-leukemia virus type-1 (HTLV-1) is well known to be a T-cell neoplasm with strong mFas expression, suggesting a role of Fas in the pathology of the disease. We examined protein and mRNA expression of the 2 isoforms of Fas in fresh ATL cells and ATL cell lines. In general, mFas was strongly expressed in ATL cells, and sFas levels in sera were high, especially in malignant ATL. However, expression of the isoforms in some cases of ATL varied; there was no mFas expression on the cell surface and sFas levels were high in serum. In contrast, all ATL cell lines examined showed strong mFas expression and scarce production of sFas in the supernatant, corresponding to strong expression of full-length Fas mRNA and weak to negative expression of alternatively spliced mRNA lacking the transmembrane domain.

In 52 of 65 patients the diepoxybutane (DEB) test was positive. Comparison of several hematological and clinical parameters in Fanconi anemia (FA) (DEB+) and non-Fanconi anemia (non-FA)(DEB ) patients disclosed no statistically significant differences. The study indicated that in Turkey there were no peculiarities in associated congenital abnormalities in FA and non-FA. The rate of consanguinity was 78% in FA and 46% in non-FA, suggesting that also among the non-FA group recessively inherited disorders are hidden. The mean age at diagnosis in FA was 7.7+/-4.4 (1.8-12) and in non-FA 7.8+/-3.8 (2-15) years. Nine out of 52 FA and five out of 13 non-FA patients died during the follow-up period. Five of the 52 FA patients developed malignancies, three of them had acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML), one a squamous cell carcinoma of the gingiva, and another a hepatocellular carcinoma. Peliosis hepatica occurred in three of the FA and one of the non-FA patients. A total of seven patients stayed in remission without any medication. The remaining 58 patients were given 2-5 mg/kg of oxymetholone and 5 mg prednisolone treatment. Because of sustained remission, oxymetholone therapy was terminated in four of the 45 FA and two of the 13 non-FA patients. Detailed examination of the pedigrees of all of patients indicated the presence of multiple congenital anomalies. In seven of 52 FA and one of 13 non-FA patients there was increased risk for AML and/or other cancers among family members.","['Altay, C', 'Alikasifoglu, M', 'Kara, A', 'Tuncbilek, E', 'Ozbek, N', 'Schroeder-Kurth, T M']","['Altay C', 'Alikasifoglu M', 'Kara A', 'Tuncbilek E', 'Ozbek N', 'Schroeder-Kurth TM']","[""Department of Pediatrics, Pediatric Hematology Unit, Ihsan Dogramaci Children's Hospital, Hacettepe University, Ankara, Turkey.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Denmark,Clin Genet,Clinical genetics,0253664,"['0 (Epoxy Compounds)', '60OB65YNAB (diepoxybutane)', 'L76T0ZCA8K (Oxymetholone)']",IM,"['Abnormalities, Multiple', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Anemia, Aplastic/*congenital/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Consanguinity', 'Disease Progression', 'Epoxy Compounds/analysis', 'Fanconi Anemia/drug therapy/*genetics/metabolism', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Oxymetholone/therapeutic use', 'Pedigree', 'Turkey']",1997/05/01 00:00,1997/05/01 00:01,['1997/05/01 00:00'],"['1997/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1399-0004.1997.tb02477.x [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Genet. 1997 May;51(5):296-302. doi: 10.1111/j.1399-0004.1997.tb02477.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The total length of the cDNA is 2,637 nucleotides with an open reading frame for a protein of 548 amino acids containing 4.7% methionine and 17.2% proline. The predicted molecular mass of 59 kD fits the 62-kD band experimentally determined by NaDodSO4-PAGE from in vitro translation products of in vitro-transcribed MZFM cDNA. The MZFM cDNA best matches to that ZFM1-isoform without the so-called 0.25-kb E-domain and to the L49345 cDNA recently identified in a human leukemia cell line. Northern analysis reveals expression of MZFM only in spleen macrophages. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in combination with Southern analysis also detects a low basal expression in splenic T cells and B cells, as well as in other tissues such as heart, kidney, brain, liver, testis, bone marrow, adrenal gland, lymph nodes, pancreas, and thymus. In splenic macrophages, MZFM mRNA is alternatively spliced yielding a 3.6-kb transcript with E-domain, a 3.0-kb transcript without E-domain, and a 2.7-kb transcript with E-domain. The predicted MZFM protein contains diverse functional domains, i.e., a nuclear localization signal, a metal binding motif, a glutamine/proline stretch, proline-clusters, a CGA-motif, and a QUA1-KH-QUA2 region, thus indicating multiple functions of MZFM. Presumably, MZFM is a new member of those proteins combining features of signal transduction and RNA activation (STAR-proteins). The different MZFM-isoforms may be part of a macrophage-inherent program of transduction of environmental signals into different activational states of macrophages.","['Wrehlke, C', 'Schmitt-Wrede, H P', 'Qiao, Z', 'Wunderlich, F']","['Wrehlke C', 'Schmitt-Wrede HP', 'Qiao Z', 'Wunderlich F']","['Division of Molecular Parasitology and Centre for Biological and Medical Research, Heinrich-Heine-University, Duesseldorf, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,DNA Cell Biol,DNA and cell biology,9004522,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (RNA Splicing Factors)', '0 (SF1 protein, human)', '0 (Sf1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Carrier Proteins/*genetics', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA, Complementary', '*DNA-Binding Proteins', '*Gene Expression Regulation', '*Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Humans', 'Macrophages/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'RNA Splicing Factors', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Spleen/cytology/*metabolism', '*Transcription Factors']",1997/06/01 00:00,1997/06/01 00:01,['1997/06/01 00:00'],"['1997/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/dna.1997.16.761 [doi]'],ppublish,DNA Cell Biol. 1997 Jun;16(6):761-7. doi: 10.1089/dna.1997.16.761.,,,,,,,"['GENBANK/X80159', 'GENBANK/X85802', 'GENBANK/Y08907']",,,,,,,,,,,,

The nucleotide sequence of hLim-1 cDNA is 87% identical to mouse Lim-1 and the predicted amino acid sequence is greater than 97% conserved. Expression patterns of hLim-1 were evaluated by Northern analysis and reverse transcription (RT)-PCR coupled with Southern blotting. HLim-1 expression was observed in human brain, thymus, and tonsillar tissue. Expression of hLim-1 was also observed in 58% of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) cell lines and in four of five primary samples from patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in myeloid blast transformation. The gene encoding hLim-1 was mapped using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to human chromosome 11p12-13. The expression pattern and structural characteristics of the hLim-1 gene suggest that it encodes a transcriptional regulatory protein involved in the control of differentiation and development of neural and lymphoid cells.

The SL-ICs from all subtypes of AML analyzed, regardless of the heterogeneity in maturation characteristics of the leukemic blasts, were exclusively CD34++ CD38-, similar to the cell-surface phenotype of normal SCID-repopulating cells, suggesting that normal primitive cells, rather than committed progenitor cells, are the target for leukemic transformation.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between 1989 and 1994, we treated 156 patients with localized prostate cancer, ranging in age from 54 to 86 (median 71), of which 86 were older than 70 years of age. No attempt at selection was made, and many were from the Veteran's Administration Hospital where they had been precluded from their surgical program because of comorbidities and/or advanced age. Of 156 patients, 45 (28.8%) underwent pretreatment laparoscopic lymphadenectomy (LAP); 40 had negative findings. Four-field box technique was used for all patients. We treated the whole pelvis to 45 Gy, followed by a cone-down and a final boost to a total dose of 72 Gy. The cone-down to the lower pelvis and boost to the prostate were based on computed tomography and/or magnetic resonance imaging findings for volume reconstruction with field size of approximately 8 x 8 and 6 x 6 cm, respectively. Diet instructions were given before treatment and emphasized weekly. Toxicities were evaluated weekly by physicians and nurses independently using Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) grading criteria. RESULTS: The acute GI and GU toxicities gradually increased from Week 2, peaked at Week 5, and then declined after that. During Week 5, acute Grade 1-3 GI morbidities were observed in 19 (12.2%), 2 (1.3%), and 1 (0.6%) patients, respectively. Genitourinary toxicity was similar, accounting for 17 (10.9%), 6 (3.8%), and 1 (0.6%), respectively. Overall Grade 2 toxicities occurred in 30 of 156 patients (19%). Comorbidity was associated with more GI toxicity. Patients over 70 years of age tended to reach the maximal GI and GU toxicity 1-2 weeks earlier than did patients under the age of 70. Of the patients who did not follow the diet instruction, all experienced side effects. CONCLUSIONS: Whole pelvic irradiation was very well tolerated in this group of patients. The frequency of acute Grade 2 GI and GU toxicity compared favorably with the reported results of conformal treatment. Diet restriction and psychosocial input may have had a positive impact. Late sequelae will be evaluated in long-term follow-up.","['Liu, L', 'Glicksman, A S', 'Coachman, N', 'Kuten, A']","['Liu L', 'Glicksman AS', 'Coachman N', 'Kuten A']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, Roger Williams Medical Center/Brown University, Providence, RI, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",7603616,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Comorbidity', 'Diet', 'Digestive System/*radiation effects', 'Humans', 'Laparoscopy', 'Lymph Node Excision', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pelvis', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/*radiotherapy', 'Radiation Injuries/*etiology/pathology', 'Radiotherapy Dosage', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Urogenital System/*radiation effects']",1997/04/01 00:00,1997/04/01 00:01,['1997/04/01 00:00'],"['1997/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0360-3016(96)00580-9 [pii]', '10.1016/s0360-3016(96)00580-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1997 Apr 1;38(1):65-71. doi: 10.1016/s0360-3016(96)00580-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The children were aged between 1 and 10.5 years (mean 3.1) at diagnosis and thyroid status was investigated between 1.3 and 13 years (mean 6.8) after completion of therapy. Six children showed a low peak of plasma thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), after stimulation with thyrotrophin-releasing hormone (TRH). Three children showed a low basal plasma TSH concentration. Serum levels of thyroxine (T4, fT4) and triiodothyronine (T3, fT3) were normal in all patients. The frequency of thyroid hypofunction (low peak response of TSH to TRH) was more common in children receiving 24 compared to 18 Gy cranial irradiation (50% vs 14%; odds ratio = 7) and those who had completed therapy more than 5 years ago (31.3% vs 12.5%, odds ratio 3.18) although no significant association could be found (95% IC: 0.27-65.8 and 0.24-90 respectively). Because of the low mean age at diagnosis of our population no significant association could be found between children younger than 3 years of age at diagnosis and thyroid hypofunction (odds ratio = 0.14; 95% IC: 0.01-1.48). We conclude that treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia including cranial irradiation may lead to TRH/TSH dysfunction and therefore long term survivors should be followed for a long period after completion of therapy.","['Mohn, A', 'Chiarelli, F', 'Di Marzio, A', 'Impicciatore, P', 'Marsico, S', 'Angrilli, F']","['Mohn A', 'Chiarelli F', 'Di Marzio A', 'Impicciatore P', 'Marsico S', 'Angrilli F']","['Clinica Pediatrica, Universita di Chieti, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Italy,J Endocrinol Invest,Journal of endocrinological investigation,7806594,['0 (Thyroid Hormones)'],IM,"['Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cranial Irradiation/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*physiopathology/radiotherapy', 'Thyroid Function Tests', 'Thyroid Gland/drug effects/*physiopathology/radiation effects', 'Thyroid Hormones/blood/radiation effects']",1997/04/01 00:00,1997/04/01 00:01,['1997/04/01 00:00'],"['1997/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF03346906 [doi]'],ppublish,J Endocrinol Invest. 1997 Apr;20(4):215-9. doi: 10.1007/BF03346906.,25,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Among these cytokines, we have focused on interferon (IFN) and granulocyte (G) or granulocyte-macrophage (GM) colony stimulating factor (CSF), which are currently the most useful cytokines in this review. IFN-a is one of most useful and wide-ranging antitumor agents in hematological malignancies. The most striking effects have been studies in chronic phase CML. Cytogenetic responses are seen in 30-40% of the treated patients, and a complete cytogenetic response can be seen in about 10%. Long-term survival can be expected in these patients. Considering the risk of graft-versus-host disease-associated mortality in allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, the most appropriate category of treatment is difficult to determine in IFN-responsive patients. Elucidation of the antitumor mechanism of IFN, as a prototype for other biological response modifiers, may revolutionize cancer treatment. G- and GM-CSF (CSFs) have reduced the duration of neutropenia, incidence of infectious episodes and days of hospitalization following cancer chemotherapy or stem cell transplantation. CSFs have also been used to mobilize peripheral blood stem cells and to increase the dose intensity of chemotherapeutic agents. Leukemic cells from many patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) have surface receptors for CSFs and may proliferate in response to CSFs. However, several randomized studies showed that CSFs can be used safely and effectively in augmenting neutrophil recovery in patients with AML when given after induction chemotherapy. Various trials have been conducted to sensitize leukemic cells by CSFs, making them more susceptible to chemotherapy; but no convincing evidence has been obtained.","['Ezaki, K', 'Tsuzuki, M']","['Ezaki K', 'Tsuzuki M']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Fujita Health University School of Medicine, Aichi, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Japan,Gan To Kagaku Ryoho,Gan to kagaku ryoho.

The four cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia represented a significant excess of observed cases (26.4/100,000 for children age 0-14 y [p < .005]). The authors conducted an epidemiological study of the population to explore the possible ""local"" role of agents hypothesized or known to be potentially associated with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, as well as with other hematopoietic diseases. The small town in which the cases lived is a residential area without known or suspected industrial exposures associated with leukemia.

Cells were conditioned over a period of days with dexamethasone, at concentrations relevant in vivo, to study the effect of the glucocorticoid on calcium-ionophore-stimulated 5-lipoxygenase product and arachidonic acid release. The effect of dexamethasone on levels of immunoreactive protein and steady-state messenger RNA encoding for 5-lipoxygenase and its activating protein (5-LAP) was also assessed. Dexamethasone increased the stimulated release of 5-lipoxygenase products from both monocytes and THP-1 cells in a dose-dependent fashion. The increase in product generation was not due to changes in the availability of arachidonic acid. However, immunoreactive protein and steady-state messenger RNA encoding for 5-lipoxygenase and 5-LAP were increased by conditioning with dexamethasone. There was no apparent effect of the glucocorticoid on LTA4-hydrolase-immunoreactive protein levels or specific activity. We conclude that dexamethasone increases 5-lipoxygenase pathway expression in both monocytes and in THP-1 cells. This effect is due, at least in part, to increases in immunoreactive protein and steady-state messenger RNA encoding for 5-lipoxygenase and 5-LAP. These results suggest a role for glucocorticoids in the regulation of 5-lipoxygenase pathway expression in mononuclear phagocytes.","['Riddick, C A', 'Ring, W L', 'Baker, J R', 'Hodulik, C R', 'Bigby, T D']","['Riddick CA', 'Ring WL', 'Baker JR', 'Hodulik CR', 'Bigby TD']","['Department of Veteran Affairs Medical Center, San Diego, CA 92161, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Eur J Biochem,European journal of biochemistry,0107600,"['0 (5-Lipoxygenase-Activating Proteins)', '0 (ALOX5AP protein, human)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '27YG812J1I (Arachidonic Acid)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'EC 1.13.11.34 (Arachidonate 5-Lipoxygenase)', 'EC 3.3.2.- (Epoxide Hydrolases)', 'V38765PUZ6 (leukotriene A4 hydrolase)', 'XXE1CET956 (Indomethacin)']",IM,"['5-Lipoxygenase-Activating Proteins', 'Arachidonate 5-Lipoxygenase/genetics/*metabolism', 'Arachidonic Acid/metabolism', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Dexamethasone/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Epoxide Hydrolases/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Indomethacin/pharmacology', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Monocytes/drug effects/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/05/15 00:00,1997/05/15 00:01,['1997/05/15 00:00'],"['1997/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/05/15 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1432-1033.1997.00112.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Biochem. 1997 May 15;246(1):112-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1432-1033.1997.00112.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In difluoromethylornithine-resistant L1210 cells stimulated to growth from quiescence, the cell-permeant analogues of ceramide N-acetylsphingosine (C2-ceramide) and N-hexanoylsphingosine (C6-ceramide) inhibited the induction of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) activity with IC50 of 8.3 and 1.5 microM respectively. This effect was strictly related to the ability to inhibit cell growth and [3H]thymidine incorporation. The suppression of cell growth was also associated with apoptosis. The addition of bacterial sphingomyelinase resulted in a significant, but limited, reduction of ODC induction and [3H]thymidine incorporation. Bacterial lipopolysaccharide, which may act as a ceramide analogue, also inhibited the induction of the enzyme. Moreover, C6-ceramide largely prevented the accumulation of ODC mRNA and its precursor, ODC heterogeneous nuclear RNA, that accompanied the induction of ODC activity. A slight increase in ODC turnover was also observed. The DNA-binding activity of some transcription factors known to bind and transactivate the ODC gene was investigated by gel mobility-shift assay under the same experimental conditions. However, only the binding of Myc/Max was negatively affected by the treatment with C6-ceramide. Furthermore, the amount of immunoreactive c-Myc, which increased after stimulation of the cells to growth, was strongly reduced by C6-ceramide. These results suggest that the inhibition of c-Myc and ODC expression may be early events in the response of leukaemia cells to ceramide.","['Flamigni, F', 'Faenza, I', 'Marmiroli, S', ""Stanic', I"", 'Giaccari, A', 'Muscari, C', 'Stefanelli, C', 'Rossoni, C']","['Flamigni F', 'Faenza I', 'Marmiroli S', ""Stanic' I"", 'Giaccari A', 'Muscari C', 'Stefanelli C', 'Rossoni C']","[""Dipartimento di Biochimica 'G.Moruzzi', Universita di Bologna, via Irnerio 48, 40126 Bologna, Italy.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['0 (Ceramides)', 'EC 4.1.1.17 (Ornithine Decarboxylase)', 'ZQN1G5V6SR (Eflornithine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Membrane Permeability', 'Ceramides/*pharmacology', 'Eflornithine/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic/*drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', '*Genes, myc', 'Leukemia L1210/enzymology/*genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Ornithine Decarboxylase/*genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/06/15 00:00,1997/06/15 00:01,['1997/06/15 00:00'],"['1997/06/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/06/15 00:01 [medline]', '1997/06/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1042/bj3240783 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochem J. 1997 Jun 15;324 ( Pt 3):783-9. doi: 10.1042/bj3240783.,,,,,PMC1218493,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The pattern of inhibition was found to be similar for all DNA polymerases tested. Thus the mode of inhibition was studied in detail for HIV-1 reverse transcriptase. HPH is a non-competitive inhibitor and binds the enzyme irreversibly with high affinity (Ki=0. 62 microM). The polar hydroxy groups have been shown to be of key importance. A methylated derivative, mHPH, which is devoid of these polar moieties, showed a significantly decreased capacity to inhibit all DNA polymerases tested. Like the natural product, mHPH binds the enzyme independently at an allosteric site, but with reduced affinity (Ki=7.4 microM). We show that HPH does not interfere with the first step of the polymerization process, i.e. the physical formation of the reverse-transcriptase-DNA complex. Consequently, we suggest that the natural inhibitor interferes with the subsequent steps of the overall reaction. Since HPH seems not to affect the affinity of dNTP for the enzyme (the Km is unchanged under conditions where the HPH concentration is increased), we speculate that its inhibitory capacity is derived from its effect on the nucleotidyl-transfer catalytic reaction. We suggest that such a mechanism of inhibition is typical of an inhibitor whose mode of inhibition should be common to all RNA- and DNA-directed polymerases.","['Loya, S', 'Rudi, A', 'Kashman, Y', 'Hizi, A']","['Loya S', 'Rudi A', 'Kashman Y', 'Hizi A']","['Department of Cell Biology and Histology, Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv 69978, Israel.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['0 (2-hexaprenylhydroquinone)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Nucleic Acid Synthesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors)', '0 (Terpenes)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (reverse transcriptase, Human immunodeficiency virus 2)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (HIV Reverse Transcriptase)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'DNA Primers', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'HIV Reverse Transcriptase/drug effects', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/enzymology', '*Nucleic Acid Synthesis Inhibitors', 'Porifera/chemistry', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/drug effects', 'Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Templates, Genetic', 'Terpenes/*pharmacology']",1997/06/15 00:00,1997/06/15 00:01,['1997/06/15 00:00'],"['1997/06/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/06/15 00:01 [medline]', '1997/06/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1042/bj3240721 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochem J. 1997 Jun 15;324 ( Pt 3):721-7. doi: 10.1042/bj3240721.,,,,,PMC1218486,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Antibiotic monotherapy is increasingly an option for the initial empiric treatment of febrile granulocytopenic patients with solid tumors. Available data show that response to empiric therapy is often more related to disease classification (solid tumors vs. acute leukemia) than to the regimen used. In this study we based empiric monotherapy on the underlying disease (solid tumors) in treating 33 episodes of fever in 26 granulocytopenic children with cancer. We investigated the potential effectiveness of single daily doses of ceftriaxone administered empirically in febrile granulocytopenic children with solid tumors. Fever was treated successfully with ceftriaxone monotherapy in 91% (30/33) of febrile episodes. None of the patients died as a result of primary infection. These results suggest that empirical monotherapy with once-daily ceftriaxone is safe and effective. In addition, when compared with other extended-spectrum cephalosporins such as ceftazidime, once-daily administration of ceftriaxone reduces cost and patient inconvenience, allowing convenient parenteral therapy even on an outpatient basis.","['Bartolozzi, S', 'Clerico, A', 'Properzi, E', 'Minori, A', 'Castello, M A']","['Bartolozzi S', 'Clerico A', 'Properzi E', 'Minori A', 'Castello MA']","['Department of Pediatrics, University La Sapienza, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Controlled Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",England,J Chemother,"Journal of chemotherapy (Florence, Italy)",8907348,"['0 (Cephalosporins)', '75J73V1629 (Ceftriaxone)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Agranulocytosis/*complications', 'Ceftriaxone/*therapeutic use', 'Cephalosporins/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Fever of Unknown Origin/*drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*complications', 'Prospective Studies', 'Risk Factors']",1997/06/01 00:00,1997/06/01 00:01,['1997/06/01 00:00'],"['1997/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1179/joc.1997.9.3.227 [doi]'],ppublish,J Chemother. 1997 Jun;9(3):227-31. doi: 10.1179/joc.1997.9.3.227.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We identified leukemia and central nervous system tumor cases and controls from a population living within 300 m of transmission lines in Sweden.

We estimated residential exposure through calculations of the magnetic fields generated by power lines. We obtained information about occupation from censuses and linked the occupations to a job-exposure matrix based on magnetic field measurements. For occupational exposure of > or = 0.2 microT, we estimated the relative risk for leukemia to be 1.7 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.1-2.7]. The increased risk was confined to acute myeloid and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. For residential exposure of > or = 0.2 microT, the relative risk for leukemia was estimated at 1.3 (95% CI = 0.8-2.2), with higher risk estimates for acute and chronic myeloid leukemia. We estimated the relative risk for leukemia among subjects highly exposed both at home and at work to be 3.7 (95% CI = 1.5-9.4).

After 10 years of clinical use, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) has lived up to that promise so far. In the context of severe chronic neutropenia, more than 90% of patients have reaped big benefits in terms of improved quality of life and less infection, inflammation, antibiotic use, and hospitalization as well as oropharyngeal ulcers. With long-term use, toxic and adverse events have been catalogued but in general are not clinically troublesome and, aside from occasional adjustment of scheduling and dosing, seldom necessitate stopping therapy. Currently, the topic of intense focus is the phenomenon of malignant myeloid transformation in patients with congenital neutropenia who are receiving G-CSF. Data from the Severe Chronic Neutropenia International Registry have identified 23 of 249 patients with congenital neutropenia who have developed myelodysplasia or acute myelogenous leukemia (MDS/AML) giving a crude rate of about 9% with an average follow-up of 4.5 years. No cases of MDS/AML have occurred in 257 patients with cyclic or idiopathic neutropenia. A critical analysis of the incidence of transformation year by year showed a fairly uniform hazard rate of less than 2% per year, and the risk of MDS/AML after 5 to 6 years of therapy did not appear to be greater than during the first year of therapy. The transformation risk in the congenital cohort must also be viewed in the context of published reports of spontaneous myelodysplasia or acute myelogenous leukemia occurring in these patients in the pre-G-CSF era. Thus, the role of G-CSF in malignant conversion is still not clear and requires long-term vigilance and research. G-CSF is still deemed specific therapy for severe chronic neutropenia with a high margin of safety and should be the initial treatment for this family of disorders.","['Freedman, M H']",['Freedman MH'],"['Department of Pediatrics, University of Toronto, Faculty of Medicine, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,['143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)'],IM,"['Chronic Disease', 'Clinical Trials, Phase I as Topic', 'Clinical Trials, Phase II as Topic', 'Clinical Trials, Phase III as Topic', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Neutropenia/*drug therapy', 'Treatment Outcome']",1997/05/01 00:00,1997/05/01 00:01,['1997/05/01 00:00'],"['1997/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00062752-199704030-00011 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 1997 May;4(3):217-24. doi: 10.1097/00062752-199704030-00011.,44,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Only a few case reports indicate that G-CSF and GM-CSF might induce terminal differentiation of leukemic blast cells.

Favorable engraftment kinetics, the ease of harvest, and the large number of CD34+ cells obtained that allow for graft manipulations (ie, tumor cell or T-cell depletion) have made this stem cell source an attractive alternative to marrow. More recent data suggest that in addition to the increased number of CD34 cells, there may be also qualitative differences between leukapheresis products and marrow. In the allogeneic transplantation setting, the one log more T cells contained in granulocyte colony-stimulating factor-mobilized peripheral blood mononuclear cells compared with marrow has not translated into more severe graft-versus-host disease, indicating possible differences in T-cell or accessory-cell function. Whether such differences will compromise graft-versus-leukemia effects and disease-free survival remains to be seen. Nevertheless, it is reasonable to speculate that cytokine-mobilized peripheral blood products may eventually replace marrow as a source for hematopoietic stem cells.

Recent attempts to expand the donor pool by employing HLA matched unrelated marrow have been partially successful. However, severe graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and graft failure remain obstacles and contribute to the substantial morbidity and mortality associated with matched unrelated BMT. The use of genotypically nonidentical related or unrelated donor marrow could have wider application if problems associated with GVHD could be overcome. Based upon the low incidence of GVHD in recipients of HLA-matched related donor marrow depleted of T cells with T12, an anti-CD6 monoclonal antibody, we applied this approach to 27 adult recipients of HLA mismatched related bone marrow. Ten patients received marrow mismatched at 2 HLA loci, 13 received 1 antigen mismatched marrow, and 4 received phenotypically identical marrow from a non-sibling. Immediately prior to admission, patients were treated with total lymphoid irradiation (750-1050 cGy) to suppress host derived. T lymphocytes capable of mediating graft rejection. The ablative regimen consisted of cyclophosphamide (60 mg/kg x 2 days) followed by total body irradiation (1400 cGy in 7 fractions over 4 days). Patients then received marrow depleted of T cells with T12 (CD6) plus complement. No immune suppressive medications were administered to prevent GVHD. Twenty-four of 27 patients displayed stable hematologic engraftment, achieving an absolute neutrophil count of 0.5 x 10(9)/L at a median of 19 days post-BMT. Degree of HLA disparity did not influence engraftment. Among engrafting patients, grades 2-4 acute GVHD occurred in 40% and grade 3-4 GVHD in 8%. Chronic GVHD developed in 5 patients. Patients mismatched at 2 loci were more likely to develop GVHD than those mismatched at 0-1 loci (logrank, p = .04). Disease relapse has occurred in only 3 patients receiving mismatched marrow. Estimated overall survival for mismatched patients is 56% at 2 years and is independent of HLA disparity. Among the patients transplanted for chronic myelogenous in stable phase or acute leukemia in first remission, estimated event free survival is 69% at 2 years compared to 20% for patients with more advanced disease. Our results suggest that transplantation of mismatched related marrow using modalities designed to reduce GVHD without immune suppressive medication (CD6 depletion) is feasible and should prompt wider investigation into the extended families of patients in the search for potential marrow donors. This approach also merits investigation in recipients of matched unrelated marrow as a potential means of reducing transplant-related toxicity.","['Soiffer, R J', 'Mauch, P', 'Fairclough, D', 'Alyea, E', 'Anderson, K', 'Fisher, D', 'Freedman, A', 'Bartlett-Pandite, L', 'Robertson, M', 'Schlossman, R', 'Gollob, J', 'Marcus, K', 'Murray, C', 'Kuhlman, C', 'Freeman, A', 'Nadler, L', 'Ritz, J']","['Soiffer RJ', 'Mauch P', 'Fairclough D', 'Alyea E', 'Anderson K', 'Fisher D', 'Freedman A', 'Bartlett-Pandite L', 'Robertson M', 'Schlossman R', 'Gollob J', 'Marcus K', 'Murray C', 'Kuhlman C', 'Freeman A', 'Nadler L', 'Ritz J']","['Division of Hematologic Malignancies, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02115, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (CD6 antigen)', '0 (HLA Antigens)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antigens, CD/*analysis', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/*analysis', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects/*immunology/mortality', 'Cyclophosphamide', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Genotype', 'Graft vs Host Disease/mortality/*prevention & control', 'HLA Antigens/genetics/immunology', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/mortality/therapy', '*Histocompatibility', 'Humans', 'Life Tables', 'Lymphatic Irradiation', '*Lymphocyte Depletion', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recurrence', 'Survival Analysis', '*T-Lymphocyte Subsets', '*Tissue Donors', 'Transplantation Conditioning/adverse effects', 'Transplantation, Homologous/*immunology', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",1997/04/01 00:00,1997/04/01 00:01,['1997/04/01 00:00'],"['1997/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 1997 Apr;3(1):11-7.,,,['AI29530/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, some observers failed to confirm such a positive correlation. To evaluate the effects of extremely low frequency (ELF) magnetic fields on leukemogenesis, an experimental animal model was used, in which thymic lymphoma/leukemia was induced by dimethylbenz(alpha)anthracene (DMBA) injected subcutaneously into the interscapular region of newborn mice within 24 h after birth. Beginning at the second week of age, 165 mice were exposed to 50 Hz magnetic field at 1 mT, 3 h/day, 6 days/week for 16 weeks, and 155 animals exposed to sham conditions. All surviving animals were killed by cervical dislocation at the age of 32 weeks and were examined pathologically. The results showed that the incidences of advanced thymic lymphoma, complicated with lymphomatous leukemia, were 21.8 and 23.9% in the two groups, respectively, without statistically significant differences. But dense metastatic infiltration by lymphoma cells into liver in the field exposure group greater (50%) than that in the sham-exposure group (16.2%) was observed (chi 2 = 9.847, P < 0.01).

Its different mechanisms of action make FLU an attractive partner for combination with other cytostatic agents. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We used a three-drug combination of FLU (25 mg/m2 i.v. on days one to three), mitoxantrone (10 mg/m2 i.v. on day one) and prednisone (40 mg given orally on days one to five) (FMP) to treat 48 patients with recurrent LG-NHL. RESULTS: Of the 48 patients, 17 (35%) achieved complete responses (CR), 23 (48%) partial responses, while the remaining 8 (17%) showed no benefit from the treatment. The risk of lower CR rate was significantly correlated with the presence of advanced stage (IV) (P = 0.01), the number of previous regimens (> or = 3) (P = 0.006), and the follicular histologic subtype (P = 0.02). The major toxic effects observed were neutropenia and infections; there was only one fatality, due to drug-related side effects.

Patients present with generalized disease, and have a poor prognosis. Three different histologic patterns (mantle zone, nodular, and diffuse) and three different cytological variants (classical, blastic, and pleomorphic) have been described. The phenotype (strong surface IgM, CD5+, CD10-, CD23-, cyclin D1+ and B-cell markers+) is remarkably constant. Dependent on the methods used (PCR, Southern blot analysis, and cytogenetics) a t(11;14) can be detected in approximately 35%-66% of cases. Using FISH analysis, possibly almost all cyclin D1-expressing MCLs carry this translocation, indicating that a substantial part of these translocations are missed by conventional methods. This has been confirmed by DNA fiber FISH analysis by which the breakpoints could be accurately mapped over a 220 kb region centromeric of the cyclin D1 gene. Additional genetic abnormalities involve breakpoints and deletion at the 3' end of the cyclin D1 gene, numerical chromosomal aberrations, mutations in p53, and deletions of p16. These may be associated with tumor progression. Owing to the translocation t(11;14), the cyclin D1 gene is activated. At the RNA level, approximately 90% of MCLs show overexpression. This corroborates immunohistochemistry on paraffin tissue sections. Since expression of cyclin D1 in normal lymphoid cells is very low to undetectable, and only hairy-cell leukemia and very few other B-cell lymphomas show expression, immunohistochemistry for cyclin D1 provides an excellent marker for MCL. In hairy-cell leukemia, expression is moderate and cannot be explained by chromosomal translocation.","['de Boer, C J', 'van Krieken, J H', 'Schuuring, E', 'Kluin, P M']","['de Boer CJ', 'van Krieken JH', 'Schuuring E', 'Kluin PM']","['Department of Pathology, Leiden University Hospital, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Ann Oncol,Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology,9007735,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14', 'Cyclin D1', 'Cyclins/*analysis', 'Demography', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*chemistry/genetics/pathology', 'Oncogene Proteins/*analysis', 'Translocation, Genetic']",1997/01/01 00:00,1997/01/01 00:01,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Ann Oncol. 1997;8 Suppl 2:109-17.,145,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To evaluate the putative role of eosinophils or eosinophil-derived cytokines on tumor-cell regulation in HD, we have analyzed these cells for the functional expression of surface ligands (L) of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily, whose specific receptors are known to transduce proliferation signals at the surface of Hodgkin (H) and Reed-Sternberg (RS) cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eosinophils from peripheral blood of healthy donors and patients with HD, primary hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES), or secondary hypereosinophilia (HE), were purified by density gradient centrifugation and immunomagnetic depletion of residual granulocytes. RESULTS: By immunostaining and mRNA analysis, we were able to show that eosinophils from normal donors and patients with HD, HES, and HE express a number of receptors and ligands of the TNF superfamily, including CD40, CD40L, CD30L, CD95/Fas, CD95/FasL and 4-1BB. In addition, we provide evidence that cytokines regulating eosinophil proliferation and activation, i.e., interleukin (IL)-5, IL-3, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, are able to enhance the cellular density of several TNF superfamily ligands and/or receptors at the surface of cultured eosinophils. Finally, we have shown that native CD40L and CD30L at the surface of purified eosinophils are functionally active and able to transduce proliferative signals on CD40+ and CD30+ target cells, including cultured H-RS cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that eosinophils may act as important elements in the pathology of HD by providing cellular ligands for TNF-superfamily receptors (CD40, CD30, CD95/Fas) able to transduce proliferation and antiapoptotic signals at the surface of H-RS cells. The presence on eosinophils of receptors for TNF ligands expressed by activated T cells (i.e., OX40L, FasL, CD40L, 4-1BBL), also suggest that eosinophils may contribute to the deregulated network of interactive signals between H-RS cells, T cells, and other surrounding reactive cells.","['Pinto, A', 'Aldinucci, D', 'Gloghini, A', 'Zagonel, V', 'Degan, M', 'Perin, V', 'Todesco, M', 'De Iuliis, A', 'Improta, S', 'Sacco, C', 'Gattei, V', 'Gruss, H J', 'Carbone, A']","['Pinto A', 'Aldinucci D', 'Gloghini A', 'Zagonel V', 'Degan M', 'Perin V', 'Todesco M', 'De Iuliis A', 'Improta S', 'Sacco C', 'Gattei V', 'Gruss HJ', 'Carbone A']","['Leukemia Unit, Centro di Riferimento Oncologico, IRCCS, Aviano, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Ann Oncol,Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology,9007735,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (CD40 Antigens)', '0 (Ki-1 Antigen)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)']",IM,"['Antigens, Neoplasm/blood', 'Apoptosis/physiology', 'CD40 Antigens/blood', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Division/physiology', 'Eosinophils/pathology/*physiology', 'Hodgkin Disease/*blood/pathology', 'Humans', 'Ki-1 Antigen/blood', 'Ligands', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/blood', 'Reference Values']",1997/01/01 00:00,1997/01/01 00:01,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Ann Oncol. 1997;8 Suppl 2:89-96.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, loss-of-function mutations in cell-cycle negative regulatory elements, including p53 point mutations and deletions of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CDKI) p15 and p16 have been described in a subset of MCLs and have been associated with aggressive clinical course, blastic morphology, and extranodal dissemination. The objective of the present study was to analyze two newly identified members of the p16 (INK4A; MTS1) CDKI family, p18 and p19, in MCL. Such analyses have not been previously reported. PATIENTS AND METHODS: DNA was isolated from tissue biopsies, peripheral blood cells, or bone marrow cells of 45 patients with MCL and 15 with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Southern blot analysis was performed with p18 and p19 probes and compared to placental control DNA and to control probe hybridizations for evidence of p18 or p19 gene deletion or rearrangement. RESULTS: P18 deletion was identified in one MCL but in no case of CLL. One MCL sample had rearrangement of the p18 gene; this case also had coexisting homozygous p15 and p16 deletion. Both cases with p18 abnormalities had blastic morphology, and one had extranodal disease with renal parenchymal invasion. CONCLUSIONS: P18 rearrangement or deletion as detected by Southern blot is a rare event in MCL, but may be associated with blastic morphology. P53 mutations and deletions of the CDKI p15 and p16 appear to be more frequent in MCL, although further studies are necessary to assess the presence of inactivating point mutations or altered expression of p16 family proteins.","['Williams, M E', 'Whitefield, M', 'Swerdlow, S H']","['Williams ME', 'Whitefield M', 'Swerdlow SH']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Controlled Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Ann Oncol,Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology,9007735,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (CD5 Antigens)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Microtubule Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (STMN1 protein, human)', '0 (Stathmin)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)']",IM,"['Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Blotting, Southern', 'CD5 Antigens/analysis', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*analysis', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*metabolism', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*metabolism', '*Microtubule Proteins', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*analysis', 'Phosphoproteins/*analysis', 'Stathmin']",1997/01/01 00:00,1997/01/01 00:01,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Ann Oncol. 1997;8 Suppl 2:71-3.,,,['P30 CA44579/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This finding may result from the generally aggressive clinical course associated with T-cell lymphomas. Prior studies have suggested that stage of disease may be more important than cytologic subtype. Clinical presentation is very important in the classification of T-cell malignancies. For T-cell lymphomas, cytologic features alone are not sufficient to distinguish among disease entities. For example, adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) often cannot be distinguished morphologically from HTLV-1-negative T-cell lymphomas. Most extranodal T-cell lymphomas appear to be derived from cytotoxic T cells, which express perforin, TIA-1, and granzyme B. Three broad groups of T-cell malignancies can be identified: (1) leukemic or systemic disease; (2) nodal disease; (3) extranodal disease. Anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (ALCL) is probably the single most common subtype of T-cell lymphoma. Classical ALCL should be distinguished from primary cutaneous ALCL (CD30+ lymphoproliferative disease of the skin), which is a distinct disease entity.","['Jaffe, E S', 'Krenacs, L', 'Raffeld, M']","['Jaffe ES', 'Krenacs L', 'Raffeld M']","['Hematopathology Section, Laboratory of Pathology, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Ann Oncol,Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology,9007735,,IM,"['Humans', 'Intestinal Neoplasms/classification', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*pathology', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/classification', 'Lymphoma, Large-Cell, Anaplastic/classification', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/*classification']",1997/01/01 00:00,1997/01/01 00:01,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Ann Oncol. 1997;8 Suppl 2:17-24.,77,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The C terminus of the C5aR is phosphorylated after stimulation with C5a of phorbol ester, and this phosphorylation might lead to receptor internalization. In this context, we have studied the effects on C5aR internalization of C5a, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), the protein kinase inhibitor staurosporine, and pertussis toxin on rat basophilic RBL.2H3 cells stably transfected with the human wild-type or mutant C5aR. C5aR mutants lacked either part of the cytosolic C terminus, including suggested major phosphorylation sites, or a putative phosphorylation motif for protein kinase C in the third cytosolic loop. Additionally, agonist-induced internalization was analyzed on HEK293 cells co-transfected with C5aR and the pertussis toxin-resistant G protein alpha subunit, G alpha 16. Staurosporine-sensitive agonist-dependent C5aR internalization could be detected, suggesting that C5aR phosphorylation, most likely of the C terminus, participates in this type of internalization. In contrast, PMA-induced C5aR internalization seems to be independent of putative phosphorylation sites in either the truncated section of the C terminus or the third cytosolic loop. The phorbol ester-induced C5aR internalization may, therefore, be caused by an indirect and less specific effect of protein kinase C on the internalization machinery. Manipulation of the pertussis toxin-sensitive or -resistant G protein-dependent signal transduction had no effect on ligand-induced internalization.","['Bock, D', 'Martin, U', 'Gartner, S', 'Rheinheimer, C', 'Raffetseder, U', 'Arseniev, L', 'Barker, M D', 'Monk, P N', 'Bautsch, W', 'Kohl, J', 'Klos, A']","['Bock D', 'Martin U', 'Gartner S', 'Rheinheimer C', 'Raffetseder U', 'Arseniev L', 'Barker MD', 'Monk PN', 'Bautsch W', 'Kohl J', 'Klos A']","['Institut fur Medizinische Mikrobiologie der MHH, Hannover, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Eur J Immunol,European journal of immunology,1273201,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Iodine Radioisotopes)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Receptor, Anaphylatoxin C5a)', '0 (Receptors, Complement)', '0 (Virulence Factors, Bordetella)', '80295-54-1 (Complement C5a)', 'EC 2.4.2.31 (Pertussis Toxin)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD/genetics/*metabolism/*physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Complement C5a/*metabolism', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/drug effects/genetics', 'Humans', 'Iodine Radioisotopes', 'Kidney/cytology/embryology', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/metabolism', 'Ligands', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Peptide Fragments/pharmacology', 'Pertussis Toxin', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors', 'Rats', 'Receptor, Anaphylatoxin C5a', 'Receptors, Complement/genetics/*metabolism/*physiology', 'Staurosporine/pharmacology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Virulence Factors, Bordetella/agonists']",1997/06/01 00:00,1997/06/01 00:01,['1997/06/01 00:00'],"['1997/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/eji.1830270631 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Immunol. 1997 Jun;27(6):1522-9. doi: 10.1002/eji.1830270631.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The modulation of CD80 and CD86 expression on the HTLV-I-infected cells and its physiological role in the interaction of infected CD4+ T cells with uninfected CD4+ T cells was examined. The HTLV-I-infected CD4+ T cell lines established from ATL patients and normal donors by infecting their CD4+ T cells with the virus expressed CD80, CD86, and HLA-DR, and induced a proliferation of autologous and allogenic CD4+ T cells. While the CD4+ T cells stimulated with the autologous HTLV-I-infected cells for 7 days expressed CD80 and CD86 but not HTLV-I gene products, they expressed HTLV-I gag antigen after 4 weeks. The interaction of HTLV-I-infected and -uninfected CD4+ T cells was profoundly suppressed by a combination of CD80 and CD86 monoclonal antibodies.

In a 10-year period, 1,143 marrow samples from patients with newly diagnosed leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome were referred. Successful studies were completed on 992 cases (87%). Among all referred cases, the rates of detection of cytogenetically abnormal clones were 95% for chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), 54% for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), 51% for acute myeloid leukemia (ANLL), and 43% for myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Of 169 cases of CML studied, 90.5% bore the standard Philadelphia chromosome (Ph), 3.55% had an unusual Ph, and 5.33% were Ph-negative. Among the 59 cases of cytogenetically abnormal MDS, common abnormalities observed were trisomy 8 and changes resulting in loss of material from the long arm of chromosomes 5 and 7, and 20q-. Of the 168 abnormal ANLL, there was a strikingly non-random pattern of aneuploidy, with monosomy 7 and trisomy 8 predominating. Common structural changes observed were changes resulting in loss of material from the long arm of chromosomes 5 and 7, trisomy 8, rearrangements of 11q23, t(15;17), t(8;21), rearrangements of 12q13 and 3q, inversion 16, trisomy 11, Ph, trisomy 21, t(6;9) and t(1;22). The differences between adult and pediatric findings were minor, with the exception of chromosome 5 abnormalities, which were common among adults with ANLL but rare in the pediatric cases. There were 273 ALLs with abnormal cytogenetic findings. There was preferential gain of chromosomes 21, X, 14, 6, 4, 18, 17, and 10 (in decreasing order of frequency) in leukemic clones. Of the 193 ALLs with structural changes, many fell into-well-defined categories with established correlations to FAB subtypes. Common changes in ALL were rearrangements of 9p, 12p, 6q, TCR loci, 11q23, Ig loci, and 8q24, and duplication of 1q, Ph, i(17q), t(1;19), i(9q) and dic(9;12). The detailed documentation of the cytogenetic findings in this relatively large, single-institution study will likely facilitate the further characterization of rare, primary cytogenetic changes associated with leukemias and MDS.

Furthermore, hyperimmunization with irradiated monoclonal M1-B7-1+ (F7) cells could partly cure mice previously injected with a lethal number of M1 cells. Although other groups have demonstrated that live, proliferating B7-1-transduced leukemic cells can improve antitumor immunity, this is the first report which shows that irradiated B7-1-transduced myeloid leukemic cells can induce protective and therapeutic immunity against leukemia.","['Hirano, N', 'Takahashi, T', 'Takahashi, T', 'Azuma, M', 'Yazaki, Y', 'Yagita, H', 'Hirai, H']","['Hirano N', 'Takahashi T', 'Takahashi T', 'Azuma M', 'Yazaki Y', 'Yagita H', 'Hirai H']","['Third Department of Internal Medicine, University of Tokyo.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (B7-1 Antigen)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '126547-89-5 (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B7-1 Antigen/*biosynthesis', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Genetic Therapy', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/biosynthesis', '*Immunotherapy', 'Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1/biosynthesis', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*immunology/*therapy', 'Lymphocyte Depletion', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Survival Rate', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/*immunology', 'Transfection/methods']",1997/04/01 00:00,1997/04/01 00:01,['1997/04/01 00:00'],"['1997/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1997 Apr;11 Suppl 3:577-81.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To augment antitumor effect in vivo, the combination therapy with a costimulatory gene and a cytokine, interkeukin 12 (IL-12), gene to treat metastatic mouse lung tumor was investigated. We transfected with mouse B7 and/or IL-12 into mouse lung carcinoma 3LL, and three transfectants (IL-12/3LL, B7/3LL and IL-12/B7/3LL) were generated. CTL activity induced by the inoculation of IL-12/B7/3LL was increased about 10-fold compared with parental 3LL inoculation. We then examined the therapeutic efficacy of combination with B7 and IL-12-transduced tumors. Four weeks after 3LL inoculation, lung metastasis was significantly reduced by IL-12/B7/3LL post-inoculation, indicating that potent therapeutic antitumor immunity can be induced by combination with costimulators B7 and IL-12. Recently, it was reported that p40 subunit of IL-12 appeared to be a specific inhibitor for IL-12 heterodimer in vitro. To clarify the biological functions of p40 in vivo, we generated the myoblast transfectants which produced IL-12 p40 alone. Local production of IL-12 p40 from transfectant could suppress allogenic CTL induction and Th1-type antibodies (IgG2a/2b/3) production in vivo. Furthermore, IL-12 p40 producing myoblast are less susceptible to rejection compared with parental myoblast, indicating that IL-12 p40 gene transfer may be useful therapeutically in Th1-mediated transplantation and autoimmune disorders.","['Kato, K', 'Okumura, K', 'Yagita, H']","['Kato K', 'Okumura K', 'Yagita H']","['Department of Immunology, Juntendo University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (B7-1 Antigen)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '187348-17-0 (Interleukin-12)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibody Formation', 'B7-1 Antigen/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Dimerization', '*Genetic Therapy', 'Immunoglobulin G/biosynthesis/classification', '*Immunotherapy', 'Interleukin-12/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Lung Neoplasms/immunology/secondary/*therapy', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Th1 Cells/immunology', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/04/01 00:00,1997/04/01 00:01,['1997/04/01 00:00'],"['1997/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1997 Apr;11 Suppl 3:572-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Intraperitoneal injections of rIL-12 into later stages of tumor-bearing mice induced not only a striking reversal of suppressed IFN-gamma-production by splenic T cells, but also complete regression of s.c. growing tumors. A massive infiltration of lymphoid cells was found following IL-12 treatment. Whereas fresh spleen cells obtained from IL-12-treated tumor-bearing mice failed to express IFN-gamma mRNA, significant levels of IFN-gamma mRNA were detected in the tumor mass of the same mice. The systemic administration of anti-IFN-gamma antibody (Ab) prior to IL-12 injection abrogated the anti-tumor effect of IL-12 although this Ab did neither inhibit accumulation of lymphoid cells to tumor sites nor in situ IFN-gamma expression. Importantly, while high levels of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) mRNA expression was induced in tumor masses after IL-12 treatment, its expression was completely inhibited by pretreatment with anti-IFN-gamma Ab. Thus, induction of tumor regression by IL-12 is ascribed to a series of events: a striking reversal of suppressed IFN-gamma production by anti-tumor T cells, their accumulation and IFN-gamma production at tumor sites, and manifestation of IFN-gamma activity as exemplified by iNOS expression.","['Fujiwara, H', 'Hamaoka, T']","['Fujiwara H', 'Hamaoka T']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '187348-17-0 (Interleukin-12)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (Nitric Oxide Synthase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies/pharmacology', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Female', 'Immunotherapy', 'Interferon-gamma/*biosynthesis/immunology', 'Interleukin-12/*therapeutic use', 'Lymphocytes, Tumor-Infiltrating/immunology', 'Mice', 'Nitric Oxide Synthase/biosynthesis', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/immunology/pathology/therapy', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Recombinant Proteins/therapeutic use', 'Spleen/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects']",1997/04/01 00:00,1997/04/01 00:01,['1997/04/01 00:00'],"['1997/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1997 Apr;11 Suppl 3:570-1.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We demonstrated previously that expression of T cell costimulatory molecule B7-1, a counterreceptor for CD28, on tumors led to tumor regression in syngeneic mice. We have used retrovirus to transfer B7-1 into a variety of murine tumor lines to examine their ability to stimulate CTL in vivo and in vitro. Expression of B7 results in increased immunogenicity in immunogenic, but not poorly-immunogenic tumors, suggesting a deficiency of tumor cells on antigen presentation. We analyze tumor epitopes associated with MHC molecules by HPLC combining with specific CTL clones and the results indicate that many non-immunodominant epitopes do not normally induce a response unless B7 costimulation is provided. Furthermore, increased T cell receptor signaling, such as co-expression of CD2 ligand with B7-1, can convert some poorly-immunogenic tumours to become immunogenic. Our results indicate that deficiency on antigenic signaling in many tumors could be a quantitative phenomenon. Induction of T cell immunity by targeting on both antigen receptor and costimulatory pathway thus may be useful for cancer treatment.","['Chen, L']",['Chen L'],"['Laboratory of Tumour Immunology, Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceutical Research Institute, Seattle, Washington 98121, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (B7-1 Antigen)', '0 (CD28 Antigens)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B7-1 Antigen/*biosynthesis', 'CD28 Antigens/*biosynthesis', 'Immunotherapy', 'Major Histocompatibility Complex', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Sarcoma, Experimental/*immunology/*therapy', 'Signal Transduction', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology', 'Transfection', 'Transplantation, Isogeneic']",1997/04/01 00:00,1997/04/01 00:01,['1997/04/01 00:00'],"['1997/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1997 Apr;11 Suppl 3:567-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, maintenance of even a low plasma ara-C level after ara-C therapy could enhance the antileukemic effect of the agent. 2. Ara-C activation was increased in the presence of 6MP by suppressing elevation of deaminase activity in the cell suspection medium. Therefore, administration of 6MP prior to ara-C therapy could enhance the antileukemic effect of the agent. 3. Ten micrograms/ml of ara-C, corresponding to intermediate dose ara-C therapy, induced rapid endonuclease activation, DNA ladder fragmentation and subsequent apoptosis in large numbers of leukemic cells, suggesting that intermediate dose ara-C therapy is effective in reducing residual leukemic cells after therapy. 4. Blood transfusion for patients with high grade anemia prior to bebenoyl ara-C therapy prolonged higher and longer plasma drug maintenance. 5. Flowcytometry of cell cycle progression of L1210 cells treated by ara-C and daunorubicin revealed that a combination of ara-C first and daunorubicin second was superior to the reverse sequential combination.

PCR analysis revealed that HIV-1 proviral DNA integrated in the PBMC of ACs following infection gradually decreased. Such tapering consequences of in vitro HIV-1 infection in the PBMC of ACs were abrogated by depletion of CD8+ T cells from the culture. Furthermore, the viruses subsequently produced by the PBMC of an AC were less able to replicate than the virus produced by CD8+ cell-depleted PBMC of the same donor. These observations suggested that the CD8+ T cell-mediated suppression of HIV-1 replication in ACs may involve both cytocidal and cytostatic mechanisms: the former kills the cells producing viruses, and the latter inhibits viral spread by reducing viral infectivity.","['Kannagi, M', 'Nakamura, T', 'Akari, H', 'Kuroda, M J', 'Fujii, M', 'Oka, S', 'Iwamoto, A', 'Kurata, T', 'Higashi, D', 'Harada, S']","['Kannagi M', 'Nakamura T', 'Akari H', 'Kuroda MJ', 'Fujii M', 'Oka S', 'Iwamoto A', 'Kurata T', 'Higashi D', 'Harada S']","['Department of Immunotherapeutics, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (HIV Core Protein p24)']",IM,"['CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Carrier State', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA, Viral/*analysis', 'Genome, Viral', 'HIV Core Protein p24/biosynthesis', 'HIV Seropositivity/*immunology/virology', 'HIV-1/genetics/isolation & purification/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Lymphocyte Depletion', 'Lymphocytes/immunology/*virology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Proviruses/genetics/physiology', 'Time Factors', '*Virus Integration', '*Virus Replication']",1997/04/01 00:00,1997/04/01 00:01,['1997/04/01 00:00'],"['1997/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1997 Apr;11 Suppl 3:545-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus, the term pyothorax-associated lymphoma (PAL) has been proposed for this type of tumor. Most of PALs are diffuse lymphoma of B cell type and contain Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA. We have established two lymphoma cell lines from the biopsy specimens of PAL cases, OPL-1 and OPL-2. Both cell lines contain EBV DNA, but only OPL-1 expresses Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen 2 (EBNA2) that works as a target molecule for cell-mediated immune response. In this study, we examined the expression of immunosuppressive factors in OPLs. Only OPL-1, not OPL-2, expressed interleukin-10 (IL-10) mRNA and secreted IL-10 into culture supernatant. Both OPL-1 and OPL-2 expressed transforming growth factor (TGF) beta 1 mRNA, however, neither expressed latent TGF beta binding protein (LTBP) mRNA at detectable level by Northern blot analysis. Because TGF beta expresses its functions in cooperation with LTBP, the biological functions of TGF beta 1 could be negligible. Neither cell lines expressed EBV BCRF1 mRNA at detectable level, a viral gene product which is partly homologous to human IL-10 and shares biological activities of IL-10. Since OPL-1 shows weaker proliferative activity than OPL-2 and expresses viral antigens, the production of an immunosuppressive cytokine, IL-10, might contribute to the development of overt lymphoma. The present study suggested that immunosuppressive cytokine plays a role in lymphomagenesis of immunocompetent patients.","['Kanno, H', 'Naka, N', 'Yasunaga, Y', 'Aozasa, K']","['Kanno H', 'Naka N', 'Yasunaga Y', 'Aozasa K']","['Department of Pathology, Osaka University Medical School, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Epstein-Barr Virus Nuclear Antigens)', '0 (Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)']",IM,"['DNA, Viral/analysis', 'Empyema, Pleural/complications/*immunology', 'Epstein-Barr Virus Nuclear Antigens/biosynthesis', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/*isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Immune Tolerance', 'Interleukin-10/*biosynthesis/physiology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/etiology/immunology/*pathology', 'Pleural Neoplasms/etiology/immunology/*pathology', 'Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen/biosynthesis', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/biosynthesis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/04/01 00:00,1997/04/01 00:01,['1997/04/01 00:00'],"['1997/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1997 Apr;11 Suppl 3:525-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Molecular monitoring of the post transplant marrow can be useful in predicting relapse particularly in CML patients where the Philadelphia chromosome or its molecular counterpart, the BCR-ABL fusion messenger RNA can be used as a leukaemia specific marker of minimal residual disease (MRD). We have investigated chimaerism (using polymerase chain reaction of short tandem repeat sequences (STR-PCR)) and MRD status (using reverse transcriptase PCR of the BCR-ABL fusion mRNA) in a serial fashion in 18 patients who were in clinical and haematological remission post allogeneic BMT for chronic phase CML. Eleven patients exhibited complete donor chimaerism with no evidence of minimal residual disease. Five patients had transient or low level stable MC. Late MC and MRD was observed in two patients who relapsed > 6 years after T cell depleted BMT for CML.

German CML Study Group.,506-11,"Four randomized prospective studies on interferon alpha (IFN) in CML report varying degrees of prolongation of the chronic phase of CML and of survival as compared to conventional therapies. There is agreement that IFN prolongs survival as compared to standard busulfan. There is disagreement, however, as to which degree IFN is superior to hydroxyurea. Whereas the randomized studies of the Italian cooperative group and of the British MRC find a statistically significant survival advantage of IFN over hydroxyurea of about 20 months, this difference is only 10 months in the German randomized study and not significant. One reason for this difference might be the more intensive treatment schedule for the hydroxyurea control group in the German study. Other reasons might be differences in risk profiles between the patient groups studied and in strategies of IFN therapy. About 1% of the human genome consists of retroviral or retroviral-like sequences. By analogy to animal models, endogenous retroviruses might also have pathogenic potential in human disease. The transposon-like structure of retroviruses that enables them to integrate at almost any position in the host genome and the capability of retroviruses to serve as efficient vehicles of cellular genes are in support of a pathogenic potential. Furthermore, particles resembling retroviruses have been observed long ago in human embryonic and malignant tissues and cell lines. Sequence information and the transcriptional activity of the endogenous sequences argue against the possibility that these sequences are only fossil relics of early evolutionary periods. Most of the sequences appear to be inactivated by stop codons or frameshifts, making the genomic localization of open reading frames with biological activity difficult.

Using ATL-16T cells which express IL-5 mRNA, we have identified a region, within the human IL-5 gene promoter, that regulates IL-5 gene transcription. This cis-acting sequence contains the core binding motif, (A/T)GATA(A/G), for GATA-binding family proteins and thus suggests the involvement of these family members. In this report, we describe the cloning of human GATA-4 (hGATA-4) and show that hGATA-4 selectively interacts with the -70 GATA site within the IL-5 proximal promoter region. By promoter deletion and mutation analyses, we established this region as a positive regulatory element. Cotransfection experiments revealed that both hGATA-4 and PMA/A23187 stimulation are necessary for the IL-5 promoter activation. The requirement of another regulatory element called CLE0, which lies downstream of the -70 GATA site, was also demonstrated. ATL-16T cells express mRNA of three GATA-binding proteins, hGATA-2, hGATA-3 and hGATA-4, and each of them has a potential to bind to the consensus (A/T)GATA(G/ A) motif. However, using ATL-16T nuclear extract, we demonstrated that GATA-4 is the only GATA-binding protein that forms specific DNA-protein complex with the -70 GATA site. The electrophoretic mobility shift assay with extracts of COS cells expressing GATA-binding proteins showed that GATA-4 has the highest binding affinity to the -70 GATA site among the three GATA-binding proteins. When the transactivation ability was compared among the three, GATA-4 showed the highest activity. These results demonstrate the selective role of GATA-4 in the transcriptional regulation of the IL-5 gene in a circumstance where multiple members of the GATA-binding proteins are expressed.","['Yamagata, T', 'Nishida, J', 'Sakai, R', 'Tanaka, T', 'Yazaki, Y', 'Hirai, H']","['Yamagata T', 'Nishida J', 'Sakai R', 'Tanaka T', 'Yazaki Y', 'Hirai H']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (GATA2 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA2 protein, human)', '0 (GATA3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA3 protein, human)', '0 (GATA4 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Interleukin-5)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '37H9VM9WZL (Calcimycin)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Calcimycin/pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'GATA2 Transcription Factor', 'GATA3 Transcription Factor', 'GATA4 Transcription Factor', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-5/*biosynthesis/genetics', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Recombinant Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Trans-Activators/biosynthesis', 'Transcription Factors/biosynthesis/*metabolism', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection', 'Zinc Fingers']",1997/04/01 00:00,1997/04/01 00:01,['1997/04/01 00:00'],"['1997/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1997 Apr;11 Suppl 3:501-2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Results clearly showed that, according to the end-labeling for spleen colonies, the p53-deficiency showed rather higher incidence of apoptosis (30-50%) as compared with the wild-control (17%).

MafB represses Ets-1 transactivation of synthetic promoters containing Ets binding sites in yeast as well as avian cells. Both Ets-1 and Maf family proteins have been implicated in erythroid specific gene expression.

A high IL-3 activity was detected in the culture supernatant of the spleen cells of these mice, but only a low activity was detectable in the bone marrow cell-conditioned medium. There was no significant difference in the distribution of the STIL-3 cells between the spleen and the bone marrow of the mice injected with the STIL-3 cells. Two possibilities have been envisaged from these observations; i) IL-3 induces production of granulocyte stimulating cytokines (CSFs) from hemopoietic cells hence resulting in the granulocytosis in the STIL-3 injected mice, ii) an inhibitor of IL-3 is produced in response to an excess stimuli with IL-3 in the bone marrow. We found that IL-3 induced a production of IL-6, G- and GM-CSF from bone marrow cells. In contrast, stimulation of the bone marrow cells with an excess level of IL-3 resulted in a production of a heat-labile activity (NIL-3) antagonistic to IL-3. Furthermore, stimulation of bone marrow cells with IL-6, G- or GM-CSF did not induce the production of IL-3, indicating a hierarchical regulation of the cytokine production. These observations have provided positive evidences to the above mentioned 2 possibilities, and indicate the existence of a positive feedback mechanism in the IL-3-induced granulocytosis, as well as the presence of a negative feedback mechanism for the homeostatic regulation of the granulopoiesis.","['Sugimoto, K', 'Mori, K J']","['Sugimoto K', 'Mori KJ']","['Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Faculty of Science, Niigata University, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/immunology', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cytokines/*biosynthesis', 'Feedback', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/biosynthesis', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/biosynthesis', 'Granulocytes/*cytology/immunology', 'Hematopoiesis/*immunology', 'Interleukin-3/*biosynthesis', 'Interleukin-6/biosynthesis', '*Lymphocyte Transfusion', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Models, Biological', 'Spleen/cytology/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/physiology']",1997/04/01 00:00,1997/04/01 00:01,['1997/04/01 00:00'],"['1997/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1997 Apr;11 Suppl 3:464-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hematopoietic progenitors from 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-treated mice were separated into three groups on the basis of differentiation, Stages I, II, and III, and have studied their cell-cycling. Primary marrow cells collected from 5-FU-treated mice were categorized as Stage I progenitors. Stages II and III progenitors are early and late progenies of Stage I progenitors, respectively. The rate of growth of hematopoietic progenitors supported by interleukin-3 (IL-3) and steel factor (SF) was estimated by sequential analysis of colony formation and studying replating efficiency of individual colonies. The time required for hematopoietic progenitors to go through the cell-cycle shortened as their stage of differentiation progressed. Similar results were obtained with other growth factor combinations. The analysis of DNA content of cells suggests that shortening of cell-cycling is mainly due to a decrease in the time of G1 phase of the cell-cycle. Our results demonstrate that in early hematopoiesis, the cell-cycling of hematopoietic progenitors accelerates as they differentiate.","['Mahmud, N', 'Katayama, N', 'Ohishi, K', 'Itoh, R', 'Minami, N', 'Shiku, H']","['Mahmud N', 'Katayama N', 'Ohishi K', 'Itoh R', 'Minami N', 'Shiku H']","['Second Department of Internal Medicine, Mie University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Interleukin-11)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells', '*Cell Cycle', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Fluorouracil', 'G1 Phase', 'Growth Substances/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/drug effects', 'Interleukin-11/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Stem Cell Factor/pharmacology']",1997/04/01 00:00,1997/04/01 00:01,['1997/04/01 00:00'],"['1997/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1997 Apr;11 Suppl 3:461-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To analyze this process in which the potency of multipotent epiblast cells is restricted progressively into hematopoietic cell lineages, we have established a culture system that allows differentiation of epiblast cells as well as embryonic stem cells into hematopoietic cells. Using this culture system, we showed that all parts of epiblast tissues at early streak and late bud stages preserved hematogenic potency, while it was lost from anterior region at early head fold stages. However, this loss of hematogenic potency in the anterior region of the head fold stage embryo was reinduced by addition of activin in the culture. Moreover, in order to detect transitory stages of mesoderm cells that are the direct progeny of multipotent epiblast cells, we developed three monoclonal antibodies that are able to define distinct subsets of mesoderm cells in the gastrulating embryo.

As an approach to examine these interactions in early mammalian development, we used embryonic stem (ES) cell in vitro differentiation. ES cells can, depending upon the environment differentiated to neuroectoderm, mesoderm and hematopoietic cells. We developed a serum-free, chemically defined medium (CDM) in which ES cells survive and differentiate. In CDM, in the absence of exogenous factors, ES cells form neuroectoderm, upregulating the early neural marker Pax-6. This is consistent with the view that neuroectoderm development can represent a default state, where the absence or sequestration of mesoderm inducing factors permits neuroectoderm formation. In contrast, if CDM is supplemented with bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) 2 or 4 a process resembling primitive streak formation, least at the molecular level occurs, with the formation of mesoderm and subsequently endothelial and hematopoietic cells.

Human OSM is known to exhibit biological activities similar to LIF, because they share the same functional receptor composed of the LIF receptor and gp130.
