The NK activity which remained was always strong, and was not significantly inhibited by inclusion of antigen-antibody complexes in the cytotoxicity assay, nor was it further depleted by adsorbing the modulated cells on plastic surfaces coated with immobilized antigen-antibody complexes. Antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) against rabbit antibody-sensitized Chang liver cells was totally abrogated following the modulation process, and could not be restored by exposure of modulated effector cells to trypsin, indicating that the FcR had actually been shed and were not merely being blocked with immune complexes. Although freshly isolated peripheral blood lymphocytes active in natural (or ""spontaneous"") cytotoxicity have been shown to bear FcR, our data indicate that NK activity against the K562 cell line can be effectively mediated by NK cells which have lost their FcR.

In most instances, these preleukemic disorders are characterized by slowly developing myeloblastosis of the bone marrow. They include preleukemia, primary acquired panmyelopathy with myeloblastosis or smouldering acute leukemia, erythroleukemia, and subacute myelomonocytic leukemia. Sometimes, transitions between these various preleukemic disorders may be observed in a single individual. Abnormalities in cellular differentiation are expressed in cytochemical aberrations and in elaboration of colony forming units by marrow cells of patients with preleukemic disorders. Cytogenic and cellular kinetic abnormalities link preleukemic disorders closely to acute myeloblastic or myelomonocytic leukemia, although in many patients with preleukemic disorders, conversion to acute leukemia is not observed or perhaps not recognized.

Changes of cell surface proteins during differentiation of M1 cells were analyzed by the lactoperoxidase-catalyzed radioiodination method and SDS-polyacrylamide slab gel electrophoresis. Treatment of the cells with ascitic fluid changed the electrophoretic pattern of the iodinated proteins, the prominent change being the appearance of a new protein with a molecular weight of 180 000 (P180). Iodinated P180 was also detected in normal macrophages in granulocytes, which are similar to differentiated M1 cells. This protein was metabolically labeled with L-[14C]fucose, increasing with the period of the treatment. P180 was not expressed on ascitic fluid-treatment of a resistant clone of M1 cells that could not be induced to differentiate. These results indicate that P180 is a glycoprotein that is exposed on the outer surface of differentiated M1 cells, and that its expression is associated with differentiation of the cells. P180 was solubilized from 125I-labeled macrophages with detergents bound to concanavalin A-Sepharose. This suggests that P180 is one of the receptors for concanavalin A. Therefore, P180 may contribute partly to the increases in agglutinability by concanavalin A and in the number of concanavalin A binding sites on the surface of M1 cells, which are known to be associated with differentiation of M1 cells.","['0304-4165(79)90351-9 [pii]', '10.1016/0304-4165(79)90351-9 [doi]']",,,,

In five of six patients decrease in sensitivity to chemotherapy, or blastoid crisis, was preceded by expression of leukaemia-sarcoma virus p30 antigen(s). Leucocytes from 15 CML patients kept in balance by chemotherapy and those from seven being in blastoid crisis, were examined by indirect membrane immunofluorescence for the presence of antigen(s) related to the gp70 antigen of the simian and murine leukaemia-sarcoma virus. All tests proved to be negative.",,,,,

Molecular hybridization analysis shows that: (a) FV cDNAD+ is close to being a complete copy of the virus genome and the distribution of sequences is uniform with respect to their distribution in the Friend virus genome. (b) Hybridization of 70S RNA from the cloned helper virus to the total FVc DNAD+ probe demonstrates that a large proportion of the cDNA is specific to the transforming spleen focus forming virus. (c) Hybridization of the probe to normal and transformed cell DNA shows that there are about seven Friend virus related genes in normal DNA and almost twice this amount in transformed cell DNA. A significant minor proportion (20%) of the cDNA probe anneals only to virus related sequences in the transformed cell DNA. (d) An analysis of the kinetics of annealing of the cDNA to an excess template RNA shows that the minimum base sequence complexity of the Friend virus complex is 4 x 10(6). (e) An analysis of the cross hybridization between FV cDNAD+ and 60 to 70S RNA isolated from virus released by uninduced and induced cells shows that the genome of the induced and uninduced Friend virus is almost identical.,['10.1099/0022-1317-43-1-1 [doi]'],,,,

As causative factors for pulmonary chages hypersensitivity reactions, direct toxicity, or pharmacologic effects are discussed. Formal pathogenesis is explained by an impairment of endothelial cells in alveolar capillaries followed by permeability disorders and interstitial edema with disturbed perfusion. Disseminated intravasal microthrombi are frequent. Restitution to integrity appears possible only under favorable conditions.

This reactivity was demonstrated in 18/18 patients. Generally, the cytotoxicity was low in patients at the acute stage of the disease, but increased after chemotherapy and reached the highest level at the onset of clinical remission or just before. No cytotoxicity could be demonstrated against autochthonous remission white blood cells. The serum activity could be absorbed and eluted from protein A-sepharose CL-4B and was recovered in the 7S-fraction of the sera after gel filtration on Sephadex G-200 and ion exchange chromatography.

The purpose of this study was to determine if serum from leukemic children with ALL could inhibit normal granulopoiesis. Several concentrations of serum from 12 leukemic patients were mixed with normal bone marrow cells and co-cultured by the double layer agar technique. Also, serum from normal individuals and from ALL patients in remission and relapse was examined for inhibitors. Cultures without serum served as controls. The majority of ALL (initial, relapse and remission) and normal sera either stimulated or had no effect on colony formation. These groups also had similar percentages of inhibitory sera, with the exception of the somewhat higher levels of inhibition found in the remission group.

The sizes of these various compartments were roughly quantified at various stages of the disease by calculations based on the principle of isotope dilution and organ weight measurements. As the leukaemia progresses, the size of the SETP increased significantly relative to the size of the RETP.

That cytokinesis is not essential for DMSO-induced erythroid differentiation as measured by the synthesis and accumulation of hemoglobin was shown by experiments using cytochalasin B. In these studies, hemoglobin was found to accumulate in Friend cells treated simultaneously with DMSO and cytochalasin B; such treatment caused cells to become enlarged and multinucleated due to inhibition of cytokinesis by cytochalasin B. In contrast, exposure of cells to cytochalasin B for at least 48 hr prior to DMSO caused significant inhibition of erythroid differentiation. The findings support the concept that cellular division and, thereby the production of new cellular types are not required for gene activation and the expression of an erythroid phenotype.

At concentrations which had no detectable effect on cell proliferation, DEX3 rapidly inhibited the dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)-induced commitment of individual murine erythroleukemia cells to the differentiation program. DEX did not prevent heme accumulation in cells already committed to the differentiation process. The rate of globin messenger RNA (mRNA) synthesis was reduced in cells treated with DMSO and DEX compared to cells treated with DMSO alone. The reduction in the rate of globin mRNA synthesis was proportional to the reduction caused by DEX in the rate of commitment. DEX inhibition in the rate of commitment and of globin mRNA synthesis of DMSO-treated cells was reversible. Upon removal of DEX, continued DMSO treatment resulted in a rapid increase in both the rate of globin mRNA synthesis and the rate of commitment.

Giant granules (1 to 3 micron in diameter) and Auer rods were observed in leukemic cells from two patients, and only rarely were both abnormal granule types observed in the same cell. The lysosomal origin of these abnormal granules was demonstrated by their content of peroxidase, esterase, and anionic glycoconjugates. Fusion of small dense granules (less than 0.2 micron in diameter) appeared to be increased in cells containing Auer rods and/or giant granules, but fusion of intact primary granules (0.2 to 0.4 micron in diameter) and sequestration of cytoplasmic contents were observed only in giant granules and not in Auer rods. Although the small granules that fused to form giant granules and Auer rods appeared similar, there was no evidence for transformation of giant granules into Auer rods. In one patient, cells with abnormal granules could easily be distinguished from the larger population of cells that lacked abnormal granules. The perturbation of these two distinct populations by chemotherapy was evaluated with thymidine labeling experiments. A high percentage (2- or 3-fold greater) of the abnormally granulated myeloblasts incorporated tritiated thymidine when compared to myeloblasts without abnormal granules in the same specimen. This difference could have resulted from an underlying metabolic defect which affected both granulogenesis and cell division. These results demonstrate that the formation of giant granules in leukemic cells is morphologically similar to that observed in the Chediak-Higashi syndrome and that leukemic cells with abnormal granules may differ cytokinetically from uninvolved leukemic cells.",,,,,

After prednisone (P) administration a marked decrease in 3H-TTP labelling index (3H-TTP LI) was apparent together with an inhibition of 3H-leucine incorporation (3H-LEU LI) into lymphoblasts. A moderate decrease in 3H-TDR labelling index (3H-TDR LI) and a later decrease in mitotic index (MI) were seen. Single cell DNA measurements showed a depletion of 3H-TDR labelled lymphoblasts in early part of S-phase apparent at 24 h lasting up to 54 h after P administration. Vncristine given as a flash injection later in the study period caused an immediate rise of the MI, at the same time the P induced decline in 3H-TTP LI, 3H-TDR LI and 3H-LEU LI were continued in most patients.

This pehnomenon is dependent upon both the dose and time of exposure to MTX. Such increased killing of cells can be explained by the enhanced intracellular accumulation of Ara-C in cells exposed to MTX. This enhancement of Ara-C entry into cells was only observed when the dose of MTX was high enough (1, 10, and 100 muM) to result in free intracellular nondihydrofolate reductase-bound MTX. At the highest doses of MTX (10 and 100 muM) Ara-C triphosphate was increased eightfold and deoxycytidine triphosphate was decreased by 50%. Therefore, the maximum synergistic cell kill when MTX precedes Ara-C may be the consequence of greater inhibition of DNA polymerase by th;e increased Ara-C triphosphate in the presence of the decreasing natural substrate of this enzyme, deoxycytidine triphosphate. Enhanced Ara-C accumulation after administration of MTX was also observed in human acute myelogenous leukemia cells.",['10.1172/JCI109525 [doi]'],PMC372183,,,

Uroporphyrin and protoporphyrin were the major intermediated precursors produced. All porphyrin types were conjugated to protein insoluble cellular components and could be extracted only by methanol sulfuric acid esterification. Heme content of the uninduced FELC was increased 6-fold in the presence of 5 x 10(-4) M ALA. As a consequence, the synthesis of the minor murine hemoglobin component was preferentially induced, an effect similar to that expressed by exogenous hemin. Addition of exogenous ALA to 0.5% DMSO-induced cells increased total hemoglobin synthesis with a higher efficiency of the minor hemoglobin. The endogenous synthesis of porphyrin from exogenous ALA was markedly reduced by hemin. Uroporphyrin, coproporphyrin, protoporphyrin and heme were equally repressed, indicating an inhibitory effect of hemin on ALA dehydrase and urosynthetase activities. In addition, hemin repressed [3H]leucine incorporation into protein by uninduced cells.

Here we report the detailed properties of this cell line and document its derivation from the peripheral blood leukocytes of a patient with acute promyelocytic leukemia. As characterized by light and electron microscopy, the predominant cell type in both the fresh and cultured sources is a neutrophilic promyelocyte with prominent nuclear/cytoplasmic asynchrony. Up to 10% of the cultured cells spontaneously differentiate beyond the promyelocyte stage, and the proportion of terminally differentiated cells is markedly enhanced by compounds known to stimulate differentiation of mouse (Friend) erythroleukemia cells. The HL-60 cells lack specific markers for lymphoid cells, but express surface receptors for Fc fragment and complement (C3), which have been associated with differentiated granulocytes. They exhibit phagocytic activity and responsiveness to a chemotactic stimulus commensurate with the proportion of mature cells. As characteristic of transformed cells, the HL-60 cells form colonies in semisolid medium and produce subcutaneous myeloid tumors (chloromas) in nude mice. A source of colony-stimulating activity stimulated the cloning efficiency in soft agar 5--30-fold. Despite adaptations to culture, the morphological phenotype and responsiveness to chemical induction of differentiation is essentially unchanged through at least 85 passages. Cytogenetic studies reveal aneuploidy. Metaphases with 44 chromosomes predominated in vivo and in early culture passages; however, clones with 45 or 46 chromosomes became predominant with continued passaging. The most consistent karyotypic abnormalities were the deletion of chromosomes 5, 8, and X and the addition of a marker resembling a D-group acrocentric and of a submetacentric marker, most likely an abnormal E-group chromosome. No DNA herpesvirus or RNA retrovirus was isolated in the fresh or cultured cells. The HL-60 cultured cell line provides a continuous source of human cells for studying the molecular events of myeloid differentiation and the effects of physiologic, pharmacologic, and virologic elements on this process.",['S0006-4971(20)81842-4 [pii]'],,,,

Two-hundred-and-fifteen marrow samples from 83 patients provide the basis for this analysis. CFC concentration confirmed the clinical remission/relapse status and yielded some guidelines to prognosis in individual patients while the proportions of CFC in DNA synthesis also proved to be a most reliable indicator of disease status. In remission, CFC concentrations return to normal values whilst on presentation and in the relapse phase of acute leukaemia CFC numbers are reduced. Biophysical profiles of CFC established using albumin density gradient and velocity sedimentation studies also indicated the state of the leukaemic process in individual patients. By applying physical laws to the data obtained from such profiles, the mean volume, diameter, density and mass of CFC were calculated. CFC from leukaemic patients in relapse were up to twice the volume and mass although slightly less dense than CFC from normal patients.

Hybrid cells were grown in selective medium and tested for production of antibody to surface antigens of M1804 cells. Three hybrids that produced antibodies that bound to the melanoma cells but not to autologous skin fibroblasts were cloned. Antibodies produced by two of the clones were cytotoxic to M1804 cells in the presence of rabbit complement. Extensive specificity tests showed that the antibodies produced by the clones bound strongly only to M1804 cells; significant, although weaker, binding occurred with 2 of 11 allogeneic melanomas. Apart from weak binding of the antibody produced by one of the clones to a breast carcinoma, binding assays of five carcinomas, one sarcoma, and fibroblasts from 17 individuals were negative, as were cytotoxic tests of 10 lymphoblastoid cell lines and peripheral blood lymphocytes from 68 normal donors and 12 chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients.

Within the same time period the immature azurophilic granulations typical of HL60 promyelocytic cells disappeared and the nuclear chromatin became more condensed, but the nucleolus was retained. The attached cells stopped dividing and synthesizing DNA. The phenomenon was irreversible and independent of the continuous presence of TPA. Approximately 60% of the untreated cells and of TPA-treated cells bore surface Fc receptors for IgG. Under the experimental conditions used, about 10% of the TPA-treated cells were also able to phagocytize IgG-coated erythrocytes and more than 80% were able to phagocytize latex beads, but untreated controls were unable to do so. Cellular levels of NADase, acid phosphatase, and non-specific esterase were markedly increased after treatment with TPA, whereas little or no increase was seen after treatment with dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO), a drug that induces myeloid differentiation of HL60 cells. Peroxidase activity was lower in TPA-treated and Me2SO-treated cells than in HL60 cells. More lysozyme was found in the medium of TPA-treated cells than in the medium of untreated or Me2SO-treated cells. These data indicate that, after treatment with TPA, human promyelocytic leukemia cells can differentiate into cells that have several characteristics of macrophages.",['10.1073/pnas.76.6.2779 [doi]'],PMC383692,,,

Several nonspecific immunologic and hematologic parameters were evaluated. Patients were also monitored for changes in cutaneous sensitivity to histamine. No changes in any parameter were observed in patients after only one course of C parvum injection. However, after 6-10 courses, glass-adherent peripheral blood leukocytes of C parvum-treated patients augmented the response of PHA-stimulated autologous lymphocytes. In all nine patients studied who received C parvum injection subcutaneously for at least six months, there were significant increases in the mean bone marrow myelocyte-erythrocyte (ME) volumes compared to pretreatment values. These results suggest that periodic evaluations are desirable in patients receiving repeated administration of C parvum, since changes in immunologic and hematologic responses may be demonstrable only after several injections.

Peak levels of CMC on day 12 post tumor injection were significantly increased in Cd-exposed animals. However, whereas the inhibition of tumor growth was directly dependent on the dose of Cd, the enhancement of CMC was inversely related to dosage.

These inducers caused an early decrease in the transport of glucose and amino acids, both in non-synchronized and in synchronized cultures. Careful analysis of the transport parameters in synchronized cultures showed a cyclic fluctuation of the Vmax but no significant change of the Km. in the presence of the inducers, however, a modification of the Km and Vmax of both carriers was observed which was not dependent on cell cycle. This modification is very early and procedes the transient arrest of the cells in G1 reported previously. In addition, a Me2SO-resistant cell line (DR10) does not show any changes in the transport of glucose and amino acids when incubated with Me2SO. However, there is an effect on the transport when incubated with HMBA which induces differentiation of 50% of the cells.

Upon induction of hemoglobin synthesis with dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), the chloride flux in Friend cells gradually increases, until after five days of exposure to DMSO (when the hemoglobin content of the cells approaches that of the mature erythrocyte) the flux is three times the value in non-induced cells. A similar flux increase is observed in the presence of a different type of inducer, hypoxanthine, but no increase in flux is seen in the mutant cell line, TG-13, which does not synthesize hemoglobin after DMSO treatment. Thus, the flux increase seems to be associate d with the induction process, rather than being a direct effect of the inducing agent. After DMSO treatment, the sulphate flux decreases and the chloride/sulphate selectivity increases, aswould be expected if the cells were becoming more like red cells. On the other hand, the sensitivity of the chloride flux to the inhibitor, furosemide, and to temperature is the same in the induced as in the non-induced Friend cells, and different from that of the mature red cell. Thus, the anion transport properties of the induced Friend cell are different from those of both the non-induced Friend cell and the mature erythrocyte. Either the system in the induced cell represents an intermediate stage in the development of the mature red cell characteristics, or else the maturation of transport function in the Friend cell differs from that in normal erythrocyte precursors.",['10.1002/jcp.1040990312 [doi]'],,,,

The effects of unifilar substitution of bromouracil (BU) for thymidine in the DNA (BU-DNA) of Friend cells were examined. Cells were grown in the presence of 5-bromodeoxy-uridine (BrdU) for one generation, then centrifuged and resuspended in medium containing DMSO without BrdU. These cells exhibited a delay in the appearance of heme-producing, benzidine-reative (B+) cells and a decreased rate of cell proliferation in comparison to the control not containing BU-DNA. A transient inhibition of entry into S phase was observed when control cells or cells containing BU-DNA were grown in the presence of DMSO) for 10 to 20 hours. This transient inhibition was increased in the BrdU culture. Thus BU-substitution in Friend cells alters other cellular functions in addition to erythroid differentiation. The rate of increase in the percent of cells committed to differentiate (those forming B+ colonies in plasma clots) was similar in the BrdU and control cultures until 40 to 50 hours. After this time, a delay in the appearance of committed cells was observed in the BrdU culture. The effect of BrdU on the appearance of B+ cells was more pronounced and occurred earlier than its effect on the rate of commitment. Therefore, the delay in the appearance of B+ cells in the BrdU culture was due primarily to perturbation of post-commitment events such as the accumulation of hemoglobin. We also examined the effect on growth and differentiation after BrdU was incorporated during different intervals of S phase in cells synchronized by centrifugal elutriation or by double thymidine block and hydroxyurea treatment. The delay in the appearance of B+ cells and inhibition of cell proliferation were only observed when BrdU was incorporated in the first half of S phase. BrdU (10 muM) had no effect on growth or differentiation when present during late S or G1 and G2. These results, using two very different methods to achieve cell synchrony, indicate that the effects of BrdU on growth and differentiation described above are due to its incorporation into DNA sequences replicating during early S.",['10.1002/jcp.1040990213 [doi]'],,,,

VDS was given weekly IV in doses of 2 mg/m2 on two consecutive days to 59 patients, 55 of whom were evaluable. A high proportion of complete (36%) and over 50% partial regressions were obtained in acute lymphoid leukemias (ALL) (overall response 63%) whatever the perceptible phase, in blastic crisis of chronic myeloid luekemia (55%), and some responses were recorded in lymphosarcoma (40%). No effect has so far been seen in acute myeloid keukemia or in Hodgkin's disease. Malignant neoplasms of the immunoblastic type seem to be particularly sensitive to VDS. Continuous 48 h IV infusion can induce a remission where an IV push administration of the same dose has failed. One remarkable characteristic of VDS is the apparent absence of cross-resistance with VCR: in acute leukemic forms, 55% of patients who failed to obtain remission induction after three weekly injections of VCR (used in combination chemotherapy) achieved a complete or partial remission with VDS. The toxicity was mainly neurologic (paralytic ileus, constipation, paresthesias, loss of reflexes) and hematologic (leukopenia and thrombopenia), and was not more significant than with the other agents: four patients died of infection or hemorrhage.",['10.1007/BF00257189 [doi]'],,,,

D. Anderson Hospital. The initial study, a phase I--II study carried out in 39 patients with acute leukemia, revealed substantial antileukemic activity with optimal results at a dose level of 450 mg/m2. Toxic manifestations included an acute reaction suggestive of histamine release with dose-limiting mucositis at a dose of 600 mg/m2. Forty-seven patients with acute leukemia were treated at phase II dose levels. Thirteen of 32 patients (42%) with acute myelogenous leukemia and seven of ten patients (70%) with acute lymphocytic leukemia achieved complete remission. Twenty-seven previously untreated patients with acute leukemia who were greater than 50 years old were treated with rubidazone in combination with cytosine arabinoside, vincristine, and prednisone. Fifteen patients (50%) achieved complete remission including 12 of 15 patients (73%) who were treated at a dose of 200 mg/m2 of rubidazone on Day 1 and a dose of 70 mg/m2/day X 7 days of cytosine arabinoside (continuous infusion). For patients with solid tumors, the dose-limiting toxic effect was myelosuppression at a dose of 200 mg/m2. Other toxicity at that dose level was minimal. The best responses were seen in patients with carcinoma of the period with two of four evaluable patients showing objective tumor regression. Of six previously untreated patients with thyroid carcinoma none responded, and in a phase II study of patients with breast cancer there were no partial remissions among 13 patients. Cardiac toxicity, manifested by congestive heart failure, occurred in seven patients at cumulative doses of 1050--2600 mg/m2 of rubidazone; all patients had had prior anthracycline therapy at low doses. Rubidazone has been shown to be an active antileukemic agent, but appears to be less active than Adriamycin in our studies of patients with solid tumors.",,,,,

The symptoms seem to be related to the leukostasis by the mechanical obstruction of the pulmonary capillaries. This leukostasis was shown to be responsible for a septal and alveolar oedema. The high frequency of this syndrome during the course of AGL and of acute phase of CGL seems to be linked to the low deformability of the myeloblasts. In CGL at its chronic phase, CLL or even in ALL, the absence of this syndrome could be explained by the greater deformability of the circulating cells.

Acute leukaemia (with some exceptions) requires intensive and difficult treatment appropriate only in properly staffed hospital units. Chances of control range from reasonable to very good, especially in children, and significant prolongation of survival is seen in those who achieve remission.

Hybrid cells containing the human alpha globin structural genes were derived by fusion of populations of adult human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (devoid of identifiable erythroid cells) with adenine phosphoribosyl-transferase-deficient mouse erythroleukemia cells that contained close to a tetraploid complement of mouse chromosomes. The hybrid cells retained a near tetraploid complement of mouse chromosomes but had lost 80% of the chromosomes of the human parent cell. All of these hybrid cells and their subclones, which contained human chromosome 16, exhibited synthesis of human alpha globin chains. Human alpha globin mRNA was also demonstrated to be present in one of these hybrid cells by RNA.cDNA molecular hybridization analysis. We conclude that the mechanism responsible for restricting expression of the human globin genes in nonerthroid cells is not irreversible, at least for those globin structural genes that are actively transcribed in erythroid cells during adult life.

In an analysis of 30 independent mouse-Chinese hamster cell hybrid clones, the segregation of the viral genome measured by molecular hybridization and enzymes assigned to 16 different mouse chromosomes were compared.

Both type A and B isoenzymes were found in normal tissues, but the myeloblasts showed only one enzyme type, indicating that at the time of study, the disease had a clonal origin. The observation in one patient that erythroid cells did not arise from this clone contrasts with conclusions reached in patients previously studied with chromosomal markers. The results suggest that in this patient, the leukemic clone suppressed expression of normal granulopoiesis but did not inhibit erythroid differentiation from normal progenitors. They suggest also that the disease is heterogeneous. In some patients, the disease is expressed in cells with differentiation restricted to the granulocyte-macrophage pathway; in others, it involves stem cells that also differentiate into erythrocytes.

The question whether impairment of production, consumption coagulopathy, or primary fibrinolysis causes the bleeding complications can only be answered by controlling frequently clinical and hemostatic criteria, which include the thrombocytic stystem as well as plasmatic coagulation and fibrinolysis. At the present time, the therapy of bleeding complications in AML is symptomatic. It consists of transfusion with thrombocytes or fresh whole blood, respectively.

They were treated at 40 pediatric clinics in the Federal Republic of Germany according to the protocol of the Deutsche Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Leukamieforschung und -Behandlung im Kindesalter, which was closely adapted to the Memphis protocol VII. These patients were analyzed retrospectively, data of evaluation was July 31st, 1978. 7 patients (1.4%) did not achieve remission, 14 patients (2.8%) died during the induction period, and another 37 patients (7.5%) died in continuous complete remission (CCR). For purposes of comparison only the remaining 437 patients were evaluated (remission group). The 7 1/2 years' probability of CCR is 0.33 +/- 0.02 for the total group (495 patients) and 0.37 +/- 0.03 for the remission group. The probability of survival for these groups is 0.40 +/- 0.03 and 0.45 +/- 0.03, respectively. After relapse the 5 years' probability of survival is 0.03 +/- 0.02. Patients with testicular relapse have a markedly better prognosis compared to those with bone-marrow or central nervous system relapses. The most important prognostic factor was found to be the white blood count at diagnosis. There is a negative correlation between the initial white blood count and the probability of CCR. Girls fared significantly better than boys (0.46 +/- 0.04 vs 0.31 +/- 0.03 in CCR, p less than 0.01). There is convincing evidence that the impaired prognosis in boys is at least partly due to the incidence of testicular relapses (36 of 268 relapses were found to be testicular, isolated in 20 patients and combined with bone-marrow relapse in 16 patients). Patients with thymic involvement and/or positive reaction of the acid phosphatase in their blast cell did significantly worse (0.12 +/- 0.05 in CCR). Irradiation of the skull was performed in two different doses (1800 and 2400 rads). Concerning the incidence of relapses primarily located in the central nervous system patients with low-dose irradiation had no worse prognosis than those with high-dose irradiation but the incidence of bone-marrow relapses was found to be higher in the 2400 rad group (50.5% vs. 41.7% in the 1800 rad group), possibly due to the higher initial white blood count (median 8900/mul vs. 6500/mul). The addition of vincristine/prednisone reinduction courses during the first year of continuation therapy showed no significant advantage.",,,,,

The higher sensitivity of T3C12 cells has been correlated with the presence of 6 times as many cytoplasmic glucocorticoid receptors as in the GM86 cells.

Unlike some investigators who described grossly deficient colony formation during the blastic stage of CML, we found normal to greatly increased colony formation in the accelerated-resistant and blastic stages. The fact that laboratories using somewhat different culture techniques obtain similar results with specimens from the chronic stage of CML but divergent results with specimens from terminal stage disease suggests that CFU-c from blastic disease have more fastidious growth requirements than do those from chronic stage disease or from normal subjects. In contrast to the correlation between CFU-c and disease status in the chronic stage of CML, CFU-c incidence in the accelerated-resistant and blastic stages of the disease did not correlate with white blood cell count, percentage of immature cells, clinical status, or survival. There was no correlation between the percentage of myeloblasts and promyelocytes in circulating blood and the incidence of CFU-c in any stage of CML, which suggests that no direct relationship exists between clonogenic units and the number of identifiable proliferating cells.",,,,,

In spite of this variety of polymorphonuclear (PMN) functional impairments, there is little evidence of increased susceptibility to infections in CML patients. This suggests that CML-PMN leucocytes (PMNs) may be successfully used for transfusion into neutropenic recipients, as previously reported. To evaluate the effects of irradiation and liquid storage on CML-PMNs, 5 of our patients were subjected to leukapheresis by continuous-flow centrifugation in the Aminco Celltrifuge, and granulocyte functional capacities were also evaluated on the cell-rich plasma immediately after collection and after short-term storage at 4 degrees C with or without irradiation (1500 rads). As evaluated by in vitro studies, granulocytes maintained, even after irradiation, functional activities similar to those found immediately after collection up to 24 h of storage at 4 degrees C and presented a moderate loss of function after 48 h.

A corresponding increase in the lymphatic leukemia virus component of the F-MuLV complex was not observed, which suggests that the enhancement of the disease was due primarily to a selective increase in the SFFV component of the F-MuLV complex. That the enhancement was related to an increased number of target cells for SFFV was substantiated by data concerning erythropoiesis in iv pyran-treated animals.

Seven live-born infants died during the first 2 years of life, a frequency in accord with expectation. Two offspring have developed cancer. One girl and her father had bilateral hereditary retinoblastoma. A second girl developed acute myelocytic leukemia; her mother had received radiotherapy during childhood for a brain tumor. Compared with their cousins and with published figures for the general population, the study progeny had no excess of congenital anomalies or other diseases. Chromosome and immunoglobulin studies of a few offspring did not reveal damage from preconception exposure to cancer chemotherapy and radiotherapy.

These observations suggest that lymphoblastoid cells may be a useful model for studying the molecular alterations at the membrane level resulting from the action of tumour-promoting phorbol diesters.","['S0304-3835(79)80038-5 [pii]', '10.1016/s0304-3835(79)80038-5 [doi]']",,,,

The initially dominant type of blast cell was sensitive to chemotherapy; the other was drug-resistant, gradually becoming dominant as the disease progressed. The cell types could be clearly separated by their morphologic and surface membrane marker characteristics. The same chromosomal constitution was present in both types of blast cells, indicating a common clonal origin. Additional chromosomal abnormalities were present in the later stages of the disease, demonstrating that a distinct subclone had proliferated.

There was a marked reduction of 5'-nucleotidase activity but this is probably related to the relative reduction of the mononuclear cell contamination of the neutrophils isolated from leukaemic patients compared with controls. Another plasma membrane enzyme, NADH-nitroblue tetrazolium reductase, which has a microbicidal role, had increased activity. Neutrophils from patients with CGL had 13% the alkaline phosphatase activity of controls and were compared with neutrophils from women in the third trimester of pregnancy when the activity was increased to 8 times the control level.

CFC kinetics in blastic transformation have been demonstrated to be different from those in acute leukaemia.",['10.1111/j.1600-0609.1979.tb00412.x [doi]'],,,,

Four of these five patients recovered with minimal residua; the fifth died as a direct result of the sinus thrombosis.

Cytochemically, transitions between promyelocytes and promonocytes could be demonstrated. From these findings and those from the literature it is concluded that the monocytes of the terminal crisis in our case belonged to the leukemic cell strain and that these monocytes developed from non-specific promyelocytes like granulocytes. Our observation does not provide evidence for the existence of a separate monoblast which would implicate disparity of granulocytopoiesis and monocytopoiesis already at the level of undifferentiated blast cells.

The original tumors arose in adult female mice of strains BN/a and BN/b after prolonged antilymphocyte globulin administration. The karyotypes of both leukemias showed similar patterns. Both were hyperdiploid with modal chromosome numbers of 41 and 42 in LBN/a2 and LBN/b3, respectively. The cells consisted of an average of 37 normal chromosomes and 4--5 abnormal chromosomes. The most consistent karyotype deviation was monosomy of the X-chromosome and of several autosomes: no. 9, 14, and 7 in the LBN/a2 line and no. 7, 12, 14, and 9 in the LBN/b3 line. In most LBN/b3 cells and in a lower proportion of LBN/a2 cells, trisomy of chromosome no. 15 was found.

In this study, we show that the relative resistance of SI/SI(d) mice to transformation by SFFV is not due to the inability of SFFV to replicate, nor is it because SFFV cannot transform erythroid cells, in the spleens of these mice. Injection of syngeneic +/+ mouse spleen cells, previously infected in vivo with SFFV, into secondary SI/SI(d) recipients resulted in marked splenic enlargement, and the appearance of large numbers of erythropoietin (Epo)-independent erythroid colonies in plasma clot culture. The cellular proliferation observed in these SI/SI(d) secondary recipients appeared to be due to infection and transformation of host SI/SI(d) cells rather than the growth of possible tumor colony-forming units (TCFU) present in the infected +/+ spleens, because preirradiation of the SI/SI(d) recipients abolished the splenomegaly and appearance of Epo- independent erythroid colonies. Furthermore, prior irradiation (1,200 rads) of donor spleen cells from SFFV-infected +/+ mice only slightly reduced spleen focus formation in unirradiated SI/SI(d) recipients. The conclusion that SI/SI(d) target cells could be infected and transformed by SFFV was confirmed directly by injecting a high titered preparation of SFFV into SI/SI(d) mice. SI/SI(d) mice were not absolutely resistant to infection or transformation by SFFV. Nevertheless, cells from the spleens of SFFV-infected mice were unable to form tumor colonies (TCFU) in irradiated SI/SI(d) recipients, suggesting that TCFU are either present at an undetectably low frequency in these spleens, or that they are still subject to the regulatory influences of the Steel locus.",['10.1084/jem.149.4.837 [doi]'],PMC2184839,,,

Ninety-five patients aged under 20 years entered the maintenance regimen; 60% were in complete remission after three years. Computer processing and multiple regression analysis have shown that age, lymph node involvement and the percentage of periodic acid-Schiff-positive blast cells may have prognostic value. However, with the Logrank test it was possible to compare the two maintenance regimens in each group for each prognostic factor. Patients aged between 2 and 10 years responded better to regimen A than to regimen B, as did patients with mild lymph node enlargement. Since some of the host-related factors studied emerged as significant for remission duration, three new protocols taking these prognostic factors into account were started.

Normal bone marrow cells isolated in plasma clot diffusion chamber cultures in leukemic hosts displayed significant differences in the pattern of normal bone marrow colony growth. Granulocyte colony-forming units were significantly inhibited by leukemic hosts throughout the course of the disease. The size of developing colonies was reduced to under 100 cells; however, maturation within these clusters appeared unaffected. Erythroid colonies showed a slight inhibition during the early stages of the leukemia, a significant stimulation of 100 to 350% in the midleukemic period, and a significant inhibition of 50 to 65% during the terminal stages of the disease. Burst formation was also inhibited in the late leukemic stages. The transient increase in erythroid colony-forming units on Days 7 and 8 of the leukemia was concomitant with the onset of the anemia associated with the disease. Since the normal bone marrow cells were compartmentalized within the plasma clot diffusion chamber cultures, the suppression of erythroid and granulocytic colony development appears to be directly due to the release of diffusible inhibitory substances from the leukemic animal.",,,,,

The sensitivity of DNA polymerase-beta to elevated temperatures as compared to DNA polymerase-alpha provides a new means of distinguishing between these two enzymes even in crude extracts and a possible probe for determining their function. DNA polymerase-alpha and -beta share several properties in common, including the ability to readily incorporate dUTP in place of dTTP. The Km for dUTP varies from 10 to 30 micron with different preparations of DNA polymerase-alpha and -beta. Thus, in mammalian cells, dUMP could be incorporated into DNA, and if excised by an endonuclease, would lead to discontinuities. Initial analyses of fidelity in direct comparative studies indicate that beta-class DNA polymerases are highly accurate in base selection when copying poly[d(A-T)]. Less than one molecule of dGMP is incorporated for every 12 000-45 000 molecules of dAMP and dTMP polymerized. DNA polymerase-alpha is somewhat less accurate, making one mistake for every 4000-10 000 correct nucleotides incorporated. Since both polymerases lack an exonucleolytic activity, this accuracy must be the result of selectivity for the complementary nucleotide by the polymerase.","['0005-2787(79)90145-X [pii]', '10.1016/0005-2787(79)90145-x [doi]']",,,,

Among these, 32 patients were found to exhibit similar chromosomal alterations that appeared to involve specifically chromosomes 8 and 21. Banding studies in at least 15 of these patients confirmed the presence of a translocation between these two chromosomes. The cytogenetic findings were correlated with the hematologic and clinical data. It was found that each of these individuals had a typical picture of acute granulocytic leukemia with Auer rod-positive and peroxidase-positive cells. Ultrastructurally, the patients in this group also consistently demonstrated the presence of a nuclear bleb that has been positively associated with aneuploidy in acute leukemia.

It is necessary, in view of the rather important surgical risks of splenectomy, to clarify if the hypersplenism may be influenced by splenic irradiation in case of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) or chronic lymphatic leukemia (CLL). References in literature are rare and do not present a reliable differentiation of the syndrome, according to its present definition. Of our patients, three cases with hypersplenism verified by radioiron studies are reported: in one patient with chronic myeloid leukemia, irradiation of the spleen had no effect, whereas pancytopenia was completely repaired by means of splenectomy. The same results were seen in a patient with chronic lymphatic leukemia.

To determine whether or not the membranes of these cells exhibit the rapid and selective exchange of chloride, a specialized feature of the mature erythrocyte membrane, anion fluxes were compared in Friend cells and mouse erythrocytes. The chloride flux in Friend cells at 37 degrees C was about 800-fold lower than in mouse erythrocytes (extrapolated from data at lower temperatures). This difference could not be accounted for by the somewhat lower chloride concentration in Friend cells relative to erythrocytes. Comparison of chloride and sulfate fluxes revealed that the Friend cells had over a 1,000-fold lower selectivity for chloride versus sulphate than did the mouse red cells. The temperature dependence of chloride fluxes in Friend cells corresponded to an Arrhenius activation energy of 17.9 kcal/mol, in contrast to over 30 kcal/mol for mature red cells. The chloride flux in Friend cells was also 10-fold less sensitive to the inhibitor, furosemide, than was the flux in mature red cells. The selective chloride exchange system of the mature erythrocyte therefore does not seem to be functional at the stage represented by the Friend cell, and must appear at some later stage of erythroid maturation.",['10.1002/jcp.1040980211 [doi]'],,,,

A small minority may find in one hand a single transverse crease or the usual two creases, of which one seems to cut across the palm to the ulnar margin. Those unusual creases are called simian- or Sydney-creases, respectively. Normal healthy people hardly ever observe them in both hands. We observed those unusual creases, however, in more than 50% of children suffering from different type of malignant neoplasia, quite often in both hands. The difference between patients and controls of similar ages is highly significant. Among patient with childhood acute lymphocytic leukemia the variant creases were mostly of the Sydney type. They most frequently occurred in those patients in whom the disease had become manifest at an early age. Since fathers as well as mothers of the patients showed significantly higher frequencies of unusual creases, the phenomenon seems to be a familial one. A most singular effect is the striking incidence of those creases in younger siblings of the patients. With regard to crease variance our data are essentially similar for lymphoproliferative disorders (ALL and NHML) and embryonic malignant tumors. This might be the first indication of a common host factor in patients with ALL or embryonic tumors occurring in early childhood. We have postulated that this factor may be a regulatory one associated with cellular growth and differentiation in early fetal palmar pads as well as with cell-mediated immune response to early pediatric tumors. The observation of palmar flexion creases may prove to be rewarding in future studies of cellular defense mechanisms in young patients with neoplasia.",['10.1002/1097-0142(197902)43:2<749::aid-cncr2820430252>3.0.co;2-z [doi]'],,,,

Four patients presented as typical chronic granulocytic leukaemia (CGL) and four as acute leukaemia, two of the four children with CGL have since developed blast crisis. Morphological and immunological characterization of the blasts in these six acute cases was suggestive of a lymphoid crisis in three, a mixed crisis in two, and a myeloid crisis in one. Remission was achieved in five of the six patients but lasted more than a year in only two; in one of these two patients the blasts at the time of crisis lacked the Ph1 chromosome and in the other, who presented in myeloid crisis, remission ended in a lymphoid crisis. Cytogenetic studies showed unusual translocations in two of the eight children. Serial examination showed that three children the proportion of Ph1 positive cells in the marrow was reduced to less than 6% at the time of remission from acute leukaemia. We conclude that Ph1 positive leukaemia in childhood presents frequently as acute leukaemia and may even mimic 'good risk' acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. The response to treatment cannot be predicted by morphological or immunological characterization of blast cells. Storage of bone marrow for possible autologous transplantation should be considered in children who achieve remission.",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1979.tb03678.x [doi]'],,,,

CLL cells have relatively little SIg and have the mouse erythrocyte receptor. Cells in these cases had denser Slg and lacked the mouse erythrocyte receptor. The group presented a fairly uniform picture with onset in sixth or seventh decade, very high lymphocyte counts, splenomegaly (gross in three), heavy infiltration of marrow, relative resistance to chemotherapy and response to splenectomy. The lymphocytes were somewhat larger than those usually found in CLL and histological examination showed a quasi-nodular pattern in lymph nodes with diffuse infiltration of the spleen. Difficulties of classification are discussed. The addition of surface marker analysis to clinical and morphological parameters allows these cases of B-lymphocytic leukaemia (mouse erythrocyte-negative B leukaemia) to be distinguished clearly from chronic lymphocytic leukaemia.

His 17 year old sister has a mild normochromic normocytic anemia. Cytogenetic studies revealed C-group monosomy in the bone marrows of the proband and the third brother (45, XY, -C); band studies demonstrated that a No. 8 chromosome was missing in the proband (45, XY, -8). At least four of the siblings and their father had cerebellar ataxia, and evidence of a small cerebellum at autopsy examination or by computerized axial tomography. The disorder in this family has major features of two autosomal recessive preleukemic diseases, ataxia-telangiectasia and Fanconi's anemia. However, these and other inherited conditions were excluded by clinical or laboratory criteria, and no environmental causes of the familial disorder were found.

The tumor cells passaged in the ascites form for 7 days behaved like the in vitro-grown cells, whereas ascites cells harvested at 14 days produced progressive lethal subcutaneous tumors in 50-70% of the recipients. The change in subcutaneous growth was reversible simply by alteration of the ascites passage schedule. Day 7 ascites cells (regressors) were converted to progressors by ip passage for 14 days, and day 14 ascites cells (progressors) were converted to regressors by ip passage for 7 days. The difference in growth potential between day 7 and day 14 ascites cells was not due to effects of nonneoplastic host cells accompanying the tumor cells in the ascites population, because neither dilution of nonneoplastic cells by in vitro culture nor selective killing of H-2a/b host cells by anti-H-2 serum and complement altered the subcutaneous growth behavior or either day 7 or day 14 ascites cells.

The cytotoxic sensitivity of tumor cells to antiserum against tumor-associated surface antigen (TASA) changed simultaneously with the degree of Con A agglutinability. This phenomenon disappeared after artificial infection of tumor cells with Friend murine leukemia virus. The result of the quantitative absorption test at 4 degrees C overnight was that 1- and 3-day-old cells did not differ in their absorbing capacities to anti-TASA sera. However, when the absorption test was done at 37 degrees C for 60 minutes, 1-day-old cells had approximately 16 times more absorbing capacity than 3-day-old cells.

Thymidine analogues such as BUdR, BCdR and IUdR blocked the induction of phagocytosis and motility but not induction of the Fc receptor. This BUdR susceptibility in the induction of phagocytosis and motility was lost in a BUdR resistant line which was isolated for its growth capability in a high concentration of BUdR. Actinomycin D and puromycin brought about a marked decrease in the inducibility of phagocytosis but not in that of the Fc receptor. This led us to the following conclusion: There is a genetic control in the inducibility of phagocytosis and motility in this cell line, and the incorporation of BUdR into cellular DNA results in the DNA becoming unresponsive to a differentiation-stimulating factor. In contrast, gene activation does not seem to be necessary for induction of the Fc receptor. The order of induction of several differentiation markers was also discussed.",['10.1002/jcp.1040980118 [doi]'],,,,

The hardware and software elements are described as well as the various photometric functions that can be performed. The aim is to obtain a multiparameter analysis of morphology, cytochemistry, cell surface characteristics, and metabolic activity including cell cycle characteristics for any set of cells selected from a sample. The combination of DNA synthesis rate determination in a really quantitative approach with the analysis of features of nuclear chromatin texture opens up a new field for associating morphology with functional properties. Examples of application are presented to demonstrate the applicability of the system in a heterogeneous cell population of a very limited sample size. For this purpose, human peripheral blood cells grown in diffusion chambers in preirradiated mice were investigated. It is shown that, depending on their functions, different cell types may have quite different nuclear-to-cell area ratios. Further, a crude morphological parameter, such as the degree of basophilia of Giemsa-stained cells, may be associated with the rate of DNA synthesis, thus bearing information on the replicative activity of a cell. Cell surface properties related to the leukemia-associated cALL antigen are investigated in a human-derived cell line and correlated with cell-cycle characteristics. It is concluded that different antigenic sites rather than cell-cycle dependent differences of antigen density account for the outcome of a bimodal distribution.",['10.1007/BF00506474 [doi]'],,,,

Maintenance therapy was hydroxyurea or a multiple-drug regimen. The median survival of the 37 patients is 50 mo. Twelve patients showed a temporary reduction in the percentage of Ph'+ marrow metaphases to less than one-third of the initial values and in 7 of these patients none were found. The duration of the Ph'+ chromosome reduction ranged from 1 to 43 mo. The median survival of the responders has not yet been reached. It is concluded that whereas overall survival is not appreciably extended, patients who have a reduction in Ph'+ cells in the marrow may survive longer than the average; also, the reduction occurs most frequently in patients who have relatively small spleens at diagnosis.

Such ""staging"" is of more than theoretical value, for it may be utilized not only in the differentiation of the type of CML present, but may also serve as a useful guide in the therapy of the disease. The most important determination is to ascertain whether the CML is Ph1 positive or negative, for the latter form of the disease has a much poorer prognosis and requires a different therapeutic approach than the Ph1-positive disease. A system of ""staging"" of Ph1-positive CML is proposed, allowing a clear understanding of the type of therapy to be used and the results that can be expected from such therapy. The presence or absence of chromosomally normal cells plays a crucial role in this respect and points to the importance of diagnosing CML in its very early stages, when normal cells are usually present and leading to a much more favourable prognosis. The possible role of a missing Y in the leukemic cells and Ph1-translocations other than the standard one in the prognosis and clinical picture of CML is discussed.",,,,,

Eight patients developed leukemia several years after the diagnosis and treatment of a primary malignant disease. All the patients were being treated with irradiation, and five of them also received chemotherapy, notably, alkylating agents. The type of leukemias and the interval between irradiation and leukemia parallel very well with those reported from the atomic bomb casualties. Chromosomal abnormalities were seen in all the patients. These abnormalities have been reported in irradiated normal persons without developed leukemias. These findings suggest that the development of clinical cancer or leukemia may depend, not only on the presence of abnormal cells, but also on other factors. Perhaps the environment that allowed the original cancer to develop in our patients is capable of allowing the radiation-induced abnormal cells to be expressed as clinical leukemia.",['10.1097/00000441-197809000-00006 [doi]'],,,,

This study was prompted by reports of relatively high numbers of leukemia deaths occurring within SBR production work populations. Simultaneous with the initiation of this investigation, the University of North Carolina released a report associating an excess risk of death due to hematopoietic and lymphatic malignancies among workers producing several synthetic rubbers, including SBR. This report presents NIOSH's preliminary mortality observations and a discussion of progress made on the analyses of contaminants found in two SBR production facilities. Currently, NIOSH is determining the feasibility of doing an epidemiologic study in the reinforced plastics industry. Interest in this study developed as part of an effort to determine health hazards associated with occupational exposure to styrene. Most of the technology for the reinforced plastics industry developed in the 1950s, and therefore this process represents a relatively new industry. This report also includes information on environmental conditions observed in the reinforced plastics industry and enumerates some of the complicating characteristics of this industry which increase the complexity of this study.",['2762 [pii]'],,,,

During the early phase the lesion presented as multifocal coalescing areas of coagulation necrosis in the deep white matter. In the diseased areas the myelin was lost and the axons were severely swollen and fragmented. During the late stage the white matter was reduced to a thin gliotic calcified layer. The pathogenesis of this lesion is unclear, but the preferential involvement of the white matter with sparing of the cortical gray matter and basal ganglia makes it unlikely that direct chemical injury is the cause. The distribution of the lesion suggests a vascular disturbance due to endothelial injury caused by interaction of the methotrexate with tissue infiltrated by leukemic cells and altered by irradiation.","['S0046-8177(78)80047-1 [pii]', '10.1016/s0046-8177(78)80047-1 [doi]']",,,,

A number of different means were used to immunize both normal rabbits and rabbits which had been treated to render them tolerant of normal human splenic leucocytes. Different immunization schedules included the use of different doses of untreated myeloblasts, as well as myeloblasts treated with neuraminidase, antibody against human spleen cells or glutaraldehyde. Analysis of the sera was carried out using two sensitive techniques for detecting cell surface antigens: a radioactive anti-immunoglobulin binding assay using 125I-horse-F(ab')2-anti-rabbit-Fab and a K-cell-mediated cytotoxicity test using rat spleen cells as effectors. (i) The unabsorbed sera showed similar mean titres against leukaemic myeloblasts and normal splenocytes. (ii) Extensive absorption with pooled cadaveric spleen were required to remove antibody against polymorphic antigens. (iii) 17/95 antisera had activity against at least some leukaemic myeloblasts after extensive absorption with cadaveric spleen. (iv) Some of the 17 absorbed sera with selective activity for myeloblasts also reacted against PHA-induced lymphoblasts. (v) Although the 17 absorbed sera showed little or no activity against marrow in the above assays normal human marrow totally absorbed all residual activity in these sera against leukaemic myeloblasts. We conclude that although these sera contain activity against antigens common to leukaemic myeloblasts and a minority population of normal marrow cells, they have no detectable activity against leukaemic-specific antigens.",['10.1038/bjc.1978.235 [doi]'],PMC2009758,,,

RNA extracted from unimmunized guinea pigs of guinea pigs immunized with normal spleen cells failed to sensitize the mouse spleen cells. Sensitization was specifically directed toward leukemia cells, whereas the spleen cells remained unreactive toward normal spleen or bone marrow cells. The sensitizing moiety was RNA itself inasmuch as it was inactivated by RNase and not by DNase or pronase.

In this response, the glucocorticoids appear to act at both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels in that 10(-8) M dexamethasone prevents the accumulation of both globin mRNA and globin protein, whereas 10(-9) M dexamethasone allows the accumulation of normal levels of hybridizable globin mRNA but prevents the accumulation of globin protein. This suppressive action of dexamethasone is more effective with DMSO as the inducer of globin gene expression than with hemin as the inducer. In contrast to the situation with glucocorticoids, certain sex steroids (etiocholanolone, testosterone and estradiol) facilitate the expression of globin genes in DMSO-treated Friend leukemia cells. The modulation of globin gene expression by steroid hormones is achieved in DMSO-treated cells without altering the growth and morphological changes which characteristically attend the differentiation of these cells.","['0092-8674(78)90014-4 [pii]', '10.1016/0092-8674(78)90014-4 [doi]']",,,,

Immediate operative mortality of splenectomy during the chronic phase is low, generally less than 1%.

Splenectomy during chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukemia permits easier control of the disease in patients who are thrombocytopenic due to busulfan toxicity or sensitivity.

Blood leukocytes were also cultured with PHA for 72 hours (BPHA). Mitoses in Bu cultures were counted, and karyotypic analysis performed on cells from the three culture types. In 21 control subjects, Bu cultures usually yielded no mitoses. Relapse and remission patients both displayed significantly more Bu mitoses than the controls. The karyotypes of Bu, BPHA, and BM mitoses in remission patients were normal. Fifty percent of relapse patients displayed cytogenetically abnormal leukemia cell lines; the percentage of their abnormal karyotypes was significantly higher in BM cells than in Bu or BPHA cells. The majority of the mitotic cells in Bu cultures from both relapse and remission patients appear to be of a nonleukemic origin. The number of mitoses could not be correlated with type of leukemia, hematologic parameters, or prognosis.",['10.1002/ajh.2830040303 [doi]'],,,,

Thrombocytopenia, anemia and hemorrhagic signs including petechiae, ecchymoses and gum bleeding were more common in the AML group. This study verifies our clinical impression that ALL is more frequent than AML among our adult patients below the age of 25 years. The reasons for this finding remain to be explained.",,,,,

The ratio of males to females was 2.4 to 1; and the incidence rate was significantly higher among males than among females, especially in the older age groups. Adjusted for age and sex, the mean annual incidence rate among males (17.3) was significantly higher than rates reported previously from other areas (ranging from 10.7 to 13); and it had increased significantly during the 40 years 1935-1974 in Olmsted County.

In the granulocytic series these proved to be granules though there was a loss of their formation in most of the poorly diagnosable processes. However, it proved to be relatively easy to make use of tests for phagocytosis in myelomonocytes. In the histiocytic series the defining features (phagocytosis and proteosynthesis) proved to be too general in nature to find any relevant use in oncological diagnosis. On the other hand, the rod-like granules of Langerhans' cells proved to be a reliable guide in diagnosing histiocytosis X similarly as the Weibel-Palade granules did in diagnosing endotheliosis. In the lymphocytic series, B series diagnosis can be facilitated by the presence of spatially arranged interdigitations; in the T series interdigitations are either missing or else are arranged in a single plane only. The erythrocytic series is defined by the presence of ferritin while megakaryocytes are defined by the phenomenon of fissure-like communications.--All those features were merely supplementary in nature and could not be used as an independent diagnostic method particularly in view of the small volume of the processed specimens as these did not always contain representative material or else supplied it in a hardly classifiable mixture.",,,,,

Partial results of these methods judged in isolation may, however, be conductive to wrong interpretation. That is why special significance should be attached to thin sections of tissue stained according to Giemsa as they combine the advantage of histology with those of cytology.--In the basic classification the pathologist can do with the conventional haematological classes of tumours (granulocytic, histiomonocytic, lymphocytic, erythrocytic, megakaryocytic, mixed, and unclassifiable).

The purified preparation which migrates as a single band on disc electrophoresis could be separated by DEAE agarose chromatography into two folate-binding proteins (binders I and II) which bind molar equivalents of folic acid. One binder (I) eluted from DEAE at 1 mM sodium phosphate, pH 6.0, and the other (II) at 100 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.4. Analysis of the purified mixture, which contained more than 90% binder II, by sedimentation equilibrium centrifugation indicated a homogeneous protein with a calculated molecular weight of 44000. Antiserum raised against the purified mixture gave a single precipitin line by immunodiffusion against a preparation of partially purified cell lysate. Hydrolysis of the more acidic binder (II) with neuraminidase converted it to a weakly acidic protein similar to binder I, suggesting that these binders are glycoproteins which differ in sialic acid content. With isoelectric focusing, the binding of folic acid could be demonstrated at pH 6.7, 7.3, 7.8 and 8.2 for binder I, and at pH 5.1, 5.8, and 6.5 for binder II. Binders I and II had equally high affinity for folic acid and dihydrofolate, lower affinity for N5-methyl-tetrahydrofolate, and no apparent affinity for N5-formyltetrahydrofolate or methotrexate.","['0304-4165(78)90050-8 [pii]', '10.1016/0304-4165(78)90050-8 [doi]']",,,,

Widespread metabolic disturbances were observed. Serum Na fell below 135 mmol/1 in 14 patients (82%) and 11 patients (64%) developed hypokalaemia. An increased osmolal clearance caused by a release of electrolyte and blast cell waste (i.e. urea, urate, etc.) during chemotherapy appeared to be the principle cause of natriuresis and hyperkaluria. Seven patients had proteinuria before and eight others developed it during antileukemic therapy. Nine patients (53%) developed proximal renal tubular dysfunction with aminoaciduria, hyperphosphaturia and incomplete reabsorption of urate. No significant relation was found between this widespread glomerulo-tubular dysfunction and lysozymuria. We suggest that antileukaemic drugs release unidentified substances from blast cells which are toxic to the kidney. Metabolic alkalosis in six patients (35%) was probably related to volume depletion and hypokalaemia, while two patients developed acidaemia with the onset of renal failure.

The inhibition of hemoglobin accumulation is not due to the absence of globin mRNA. Dimethyl sulfoxide-treated hybrid cells accumulate polyribosomal globin mRNA to levels comparable to those of the parental erythroleukemic cells under the same conditions. Heme, or its precursor delta-aminolevulinc acid, can overcome the effects of the bone marrow X chromosome and induce hemoglobin accumulation in the dimethyl sulfoxide-treated hybrid cells. The data suggest that the X chromosome contributed by the bone marrow cells inhibits hemoglobin production by inhibiting inducible heme biosynthesis, most probably at the step catalyzed by delta-aminolevulinic acid synthetase (EC 2.3.1.37).",['10.1073/pnas.75.9.4354 [doi]'],PMC336113,,,

In patients without apparent hematologic diseases the white cell volume distribution presents as a broad peak. In patients with a large percentage of circulatory malignant cells, a single narrow volume peak is observed in acute leukemias and a broad and sometimes bimodal curve is observed in chronic leukemias. The volume of the leukemic cells is observed to shift in vivo after the start of effective chemotherapy as was predicted on the basis of a tissue culture model. The prognostic significance of the white cell volume distribution in leukemia and the use of a shift in size of leukemic cells after the start of therapy as a means of monitoring therapy are discussed.",,,,,

Each man worked for at least 5 years at the Akron, Ohio, plant of the B. F. Goodrich Company. The potential period of follow-up was from January 1, 1940 to June 30, 1976. Departmental work histories were based primarily on records maintained by Local no. 5, United Rubber Workers. The occurrence of cancer was measured by death certificates and by a survey of Akron-area hospital tumor registries from 1964 to 1974. Two types of analyses were made: 1) an external comparison of mortality rates of rubber workers versus rates of U.S. white males, and 2) an internal comparison of cancer morbidity rates among persons who were employed in various work areas of the plant. Excess cases of specific cancers (observed/expected numbers) among workers in specific work areas included: stomach and intestine: rubber making (30/14.4); lung: tire curing (31/14.1), fuel cells and/or deicers (46/29.1); bladder: chemical plant (6/2.4), and tire building (16/10.7); skin cancer: tire assembly (12/1.9); brain cancer: tire assembly (8/2.0); lymphatic cancer: tire building (8/3.2); and leukemia: calendering (8/2.2), tire curing (8/2.6), tire building (12/7.5), elevators (4/1.4), tubes (4/1.6), and rubber fabrics (4/1.1).

The results are compared with those of a reference cell line (LHN13) established from normal human lymphocytes. The most striking difference between these two cell lines concerns proline. In LHN13 the concentration of this amino acid in the culture medium increases by 40 microgram/ml/10(6) cells during a 72-hr incubation. In REH there is a decrease under the same culture conditions. In both cell lines proline is derived from glutamic acid and from arginine, as found with the use of 14C-labeled precursors. Synthesis of proline in the REH line represents approximately 26% of the value measured in LHN13 when the precursor is glutamic acid and 15% when the precursor is arginine. The radioisotopic assay for delta1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase showed that there is a deficiency of this enzyme in the REH cells. The defect in proline synthesis of REH was found at the establishment of this line and constitutes a metabolic marker that has persisted for more than 2 years.",,,,,

Twelve clones randomly isolated from this strain vary in their response to TPA. All clones are induced to differentiate by several compounds, the most potent of which is hexamethylene bisacetamide. In six clones TPA (100 ng/ml) caused greater than 90% inhibition of differentiation, as measured by the appearance of benzidine-reactive cells. In two clones cell differentiation was not inhibited by TPA even at concentrations as high as 1 microgram/ml. In four clones, differentiation was only partially inhibited (16 to 47%) by TPA. Clones resistant to TPA inhibition of differentiation were also resistant to structurally related tumor-promoting agents.

Patients initially received 50-80 mg/m(2) methotrexate, followed three hours later by intravenous colaspase, 40 000 IU/m(2). Seven days later intravenous methotrexate, 120 mg/m(2) was given. Each dose of methotrexate was followed 24 hours later by colaspase, and the two-day course of treatment was repeated every 7-14 days. The methotrexate dose was increased to tolerance by increments of 40 mg/m(2) with each course, while the colaspase dose remained constant unless abnormal liver function developed, when it was reduced by half.Overall, 18 out of 39 patients achieved complete remission (46%). Of these, 13 out of 21 (62%) had acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, three out of seven (43%) acute undifferentiated leukaemia, and two out of 11 (18%) acute myeloblastic leukaemia. The median duration of complete remission was 20 weeks and the median duration of survival in complete responders was 45 weeks. The median number of courses needed to achieve complete remission was three. The maximum tolerated dose of methotrexate was 400 mg/m(2) (median 200 mg/m(2)). Major side effects were due to colaspase. Methotrexate in doses of up to 400 mg/m(2) caused minimal myelosuppression and stomatitis, which suggested that colaspase given sequentially provides relative protection from methotrexate toxicity without the need for folinic acid (citrovorum factor) rescue.The combination of sequential colaspase and methotrexate is highly effective in reinducing remission in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia or acute undifferentiated leukaemia. The regimen is easy to administer and relatively non-toxic, so it is suitable for use in outpatients, either alone or combined with other agents.",['10.1136/bmj.2.6140.791 [doi]'],PMC1607847,,,

Butyric acid treatment led to approximately 40% beta-minor globin, while induction with hemin resulted in over 80% beta-minor synthesis. Line FSD was developed independently. DMSO induction led to less than 10% beta-minor globin, while hemin and butyric acid both resulted in approximately 40% beta-minor synthesis. T3C12 and 5000 originated in DDD mice. With these lines all inducers led to only beta-major and no beta-minor synthesis. The inducers did not influence protein stability or initiation of globin synthesis. Translation of poly A-containing cytoplasmic RNA in a wheat germ cell-free system led to proportions of beta-minor that were the same as those seen in the intact cells.

In the presence of the patients' plasma, the aggregation behaviour of normal platelets induced by thrombin as well as the clotting time of fibrinogen remained unchanged.

Difficulties arise from the lack of cytochemical characteristics of differentiation. This report concerns the nature of cells in the blast crisis of a case of CGL in which blast cells exhibited an undifferentiated or lymphoid appearance by light and electron microscopy. The majority (90%) of such cells contained a peroxidase in the endoplasmic reticulum distinct from myeloperoxidase. In addition, some micromegakaryocytes could be recognized among the peroxidase reactive cells, by the presence of typical granules and demarcation membranes. Since this peroxidase exhibited identical characteristics to that of normal megakaryocytic precursors, these blast cells could be identified as megakaryoblasts. These data emphasize the possible megakaryoblastic nature of cells occurring in other cases of CGL blast crisis.",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1978.tb01101.x [doi]'],,,,

However, four months later because of severe progressive pancytopenia, another bone-marrow examination was performed; it showed acute myelogenous leukemia.

The effect was specific, because no significant cytotoxicity occurred with any of these compounds at the concentrations that were inhibitory. The mechanism of action of HC was studied in detail. In the absence of dimethyl sulfoxide, it had no effect on hemoglobin levels; but, in the presence of this inducer, the synthesis of heme and globin were each inhibited by approximately 90%. There was no alteration in the synthesis of any major protein other than globin, as determined by gel electrophoresis of cell lysates. The activities of two enzymes in the heme biosynthetic pathway, delta-aminolevulinate dehydratase and uroporphyrinogen-I synthase, were inhibited by 80% and 70%, respectively. Globin mRNA induction was reduced by approximately 90%. This demonstrated that the HC inhibition of globin synthesis occurred at a pretranslational step.

Exponentially growing Friend cells, after dilution into medium containing Me2SO, underwent a transient lengthening of the G1 phase of the cell cycle before they became committed to erythroid differentiation. For nine inducing agents, a positive correlation was found between the percentage of cells that had differentiated and synthesized heme, and the percentage of progenitor cells in which a lengthened G1 phase had previously been observed. This correlation was not found, however, with two other potent inducing agents, hypoxanthine and actinomycin D. Moreover, cells that underwent a lengthened G1 phase did not always terminally differentiate. One such example was a Me2SO-resistant, variant Friend cell line (520a) grown in the presence of Me2SO.

A large dose of dThd (10 mg/mouse) could not rescue these cell lines from FUra toxicity. Instead, when dThd was given within 1 hour before FUra, it enhanced FUra cytotoxicity by a factor between 100 and 1,000 in AKR leukemia. That dThd increased the cytotoxicity of FUra only by a factor of 3 in L1210 leukemia suggested a different mechanism of interaction of the two drugs in the two cell lines. Examination in hybrid mice capable of supporting the growth of both leukemias showed the enhancement to be tumor related rather than host related. We also demonstrated a dose-dependent effect of dThd injection 15 minutes before FUra in AKR leukemia. Concerning the kinetics of killing of AKR leukemia colony-forming units (LCFU) following the administration of dThd 15 minutes before FUra, LCFU survival continued to decrease for 24--36 hours following drug administration.",,,,,

The resistant cells were much more leukemogenic than the sensitive cells, and the survival time of syngeneic mice inoculated with the sensitive cells. In a diffusion chamber in a syngeneic, inbred SL mouse without any additional manipulation or injection of inducer, the resistant cells remained undifferentiated, but the sensitive cells were induced to differentiate into mature granulocytes and macrophages and their proliferation rate decreased.

From comparison of the structure of steroids with their ability to induce phagocytic and locomotive activities, typical characters of mature macrophages and granulocytes, the simplest steroid with inducing ability was concluded to be a steroid with the structure of progesterone and one hydroxyl group at 11beta- or 21-position. The maximum induction ability seemed to require the structure of progesterone and three hydroxyl groups (at 11beta-, 17alpha-, and 21-positions). A single, 30-min pulse treatment with glucocorticoid was sufficient to induce differentiation of leukemia cells. Glucocorticoid receptors were detected in mouse myeloid leukemia cells. The binding affinity of various steroids for the cytoplasmic receptors was closely correlated with the activities of these compounds to induce differentiation of leukemia cells, suggesting that these receptors may be involved in hormonal induction of differentiation of various cells. This suggests that the binding reaction is important for differentiation of myeloid leukemia cells.",,,,,

Assays for the surface receptors of the T and thymic-independent (B) system were used to study forty-seven patients with ALL whose bone marrow contained a mean of 85% leukaemic cells. Two patients had T-cell disease and thirty-six were non-T and non-B. nine patients were identified whose leukaemic cells had membrane properties associated with the B-cell system: surface immunoglobulin, Fc receptors and/or complement receptors. Combined T and B receptors were found in one case. The same surface characteristics were found on leukaemic cells from these patients' bone marrow, blood, pleural and cerebrospinal fluid. Studies showed that the leukaemic cells were not of monocytic or granulocytic origin. Although a remission was obtained in each patient, the relapse rate of the B-cell group was worse than a similarly treated group of thirty-six non-T, non-B ALL patients (P less than 0.001). Initial total leucocyte counts of the B-cell group were greater than the non-T, non-B group (P 0.05), but when the patients in both groups with total leucocyte counts greater than 25,000/mm3 were compared, the relapse rate of the B-cell patients was significantly worse (P less than 0.025).

At least three of these patients developed acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). All three patients (and possibly a fourth) who developed AML were postmenopausal, received continuous chlorambucil for greater than or equal to 4 years, had acute red cell anemia at the time of treatment, and had a wbc count in the range of 2700-7700/mm3. After the chlorambucil was discontinued, the wbc count began to slowly rise and the patient developed clinical AML. In all three patients, the diagnosis of AML was established by pathologists on the basis of bone marrow biopsy, aspirate, and peripheral smears. Each of these was subsequently reviewed by the hematologist who treated the patients for AML. Patients who have breast cancer (or any other solid tumor malignancy) are at risk to develop a second malignancy. However, an increasing number of reports are appearing suggesting more than just a casual relationship between leukemia and the use of alkylating agents. This may be related to the dose and duration of therapy with these agents.",,,,,

Growth of these colonies was established on an agar assay system and maintained in the relative hypoxia (7% oxygen) of a Stulberg chamber. The criteria for malignancy of these colonies was based upon cellular cytochemical staining characteristics, the presence of specific cell surface markers, and the ability of these lymphoid cells to grow without the addition of a lymphoid mitogen. With this technique, specific nutritional requirements and drug sensitivities can be established in vitro, and these data may permit tailoring of individual antileukemic therapy.",['S0006-4971(20)71750-7 [pii]'],,,,

We report here that Friend virus-infected erythroleukemia cells are responsive to growth hormone in vitro. Using a serum-free clonogenic assay we found as little as 0.1 ng of human growth hormone per ml caused a prominent stimulation of cell proliferation. Peak activity of human growth hormone occurred at 200 ng/ml, resulting in a 2-fold increase in cloning. Human chorionic somatomammotropin and the Cys(Cam)53-hGH(1-134) fragment of human growth hormone were also active, but a biologically inert oxidized human growth hormone had no growth-promoting effect in vitro. Cell proliferation was stimulated by insulin with peak potentiation occurring at 1 ng/ml, and prolactin had a demonstrable stimulatory effect between 50 and 100 ng/ml. These observations indicate that growth hormone and related polypeptides have a direct effect on the in vitro proliferation of erythroleukemia cells in the absence of serum. The results confirm a direct action of growth hormone on mammalian cells and suggest that pituitary hormones may affect leukemic cell growth.",['10.1073/pnas.75.7.3437 [doi]'],PMC392792,,,

(e) The 30S RNA contains SFFV-specific sequences.

Regressions of subcutaneously established tumors were induced in 13 of 40 (33%) rats by injection of DEAE-D and F-MuLV.

Electron-microscopic and immunofluorescence examinations revealed that tumor cells were infected with F-MuLV and acquired F-MuLV-related surface antigen on the cell surfaces.

Out of 1,964 patients registered, there were 126 (6.4%) early deaths. For the 1,375 acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) patients only, there were 75 (5.5%) early deaths. During the last eleven years on this study (1965 through 1976), the death rate for ALL patients appears to have remained stable at five deaths per 100 patients, despite the general improvement in overall survival. The most important prognostic factor was the initial platelet count: patients with a platelet count below 25,000 had a death rate over three times higher than that of patients with a platelet count over 75,000.

Survival beyond 10 months from the time of irradiation and multiple postirradiation CNS leukemic relapses, both had significant influences on the development of the lesion. Chemotherapy, particularly systemic or intrathecal methotrexate, might have contributed to the disease process, but apparently was not the instigating factor.

Accuracy in measurement of cell size can be improved by determination of cell areas instead of single cell diameters. In the present study cell areas of 200 cells were determined in pretreatment bone marrows of 35 children with ALL. For better comparison with other studies which had used cell diameters only, the measured area was expressed as circle area from which the circle diameter was calculated. Cells with a diameter of greater than 12 micron were defined as macrolymphoblasts (MLB). Several clinical characteristics considered to be risk factors in ALL were ascertained for each patient. The duration of first complete remission was used to assess the prognostic significance of cell size and of number of risk factors. In contrast to previous reports patients with more than 25% MLB had longer remissions. However, nearly all patients of this group had no or one risk factor only. When patients with more than one risk factor were excluded from statistical analysis, the group with more than 25% MLB had no longer a better prognosis compared to the group with 25% MLB or less. Thus, in this study the percentage of MLB was not an independent prognostic indicator for risk of relapse in ALL.",['10.1007/BF01002107 [doi]'],,,,

This significant advance is in part due to improved supportive measures such as transfusions and isolation etc., which are frequently necessary during the induction phase of treatment. Unfortunately, such remissions are still of relatively short duration and seldom exceed 1 year. The treatment of relapses remains less successful. The first attempts to include immunotherapy in the treatment of AML have also been rather disappointing. Today remissions are obtained in 70% of patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) which last, on the average, almost 1 1/2 years. These results, however, do not approach those in childhood ALL.

This cell line displays distinct morphological and histochemical commitment towards myeloid differentiation. The cultured cells are predominantly promyelocytes, but the addition of dimethyl sulfoxide to the culture induces them to differentiate into myelocytes, metamyelocytes, and banded and segmented neutrophils. All 150 clones developed from the HL-60 culture show similar morphological differentiation in the presence of dimethyl sulfoxide. Unlike the morphologically immature promyelocytes, the dimethyl sulfoxide-induced mature cells exhibit functional maturity as exemplified by phagocytic activity. A number of other compounds previously shown to induce erythroid differentiation of mouse erythroleukemia (Friend) cells can induce analogous maturation of the myeloid HL-60 cells. The marked similarity in behavior of HL-60 cells and Friend cells in the presence of these inducing agents suggests that similar molecular mechanisms are involved in the induction of differentiation of these human myeloid and murine erythroid leukemic cells.",['10.1073/pnas.75.5.2458 [doi]'],PMC392573,,,

The results show a marked decrease in microviscosity of cellular membrane lipids in both intact lymphocytes and isolated cellular plasma membranes obtained from leukemic patients in clinical relapse as compared to intact lymphocytes and isolated cellular plasma membranes obtained from normal donors and leukemic patients in complete clinical remission. Concomitant to these dynamic changes in cellular membrane lipids, the degree of microviscosity of lipids in the blood serum of leukemic patients in clinical relapse is markedly reduced as compared to serum obtained from normal donors and leukemic patients in complete clinical remission. Moreover, an in vitro incubation of leukemic lymphocytes with normal low density lipoproteins results in an increased microviscosity of cellular membrane lipids. In addition to the interrelation between cellular membrane lipids and serum lipoproteins, plasma membrane vesicles with a high degree of lipid microviscosity were isolated from the blood serum and pleural effusion of leukemic patients in clinical relapse. Such membrane vesicles could not be detected in normal serum. Therefore, we suggest that the two major mechanisms associated with the decreased microviscosity of membrane lipids in human leukemic cells are an abnormal exchange in lipids between the leukemic cell surface membrane and leukemic serum lipoproteins and an exfoliation of plasma membrane vesicles with a high degree of microviscosity from the cell surface of leukemic cells.",['10.1073/pnas.75.5.2306 [doi]'],PMC392541,,,

The evolution of this localization can be divided in three phases: 1. During the first 17 months, an apparent simple relapsing conjunctivitis of the left eye. 2. During the following 5 months, repeated episodes of the left iritis with mydriasis and discolouration of the iris. 3. Finally, left uveitis involving the anterior chamber, with hypopion, hyphaema and glaucoma; the clinical presentation at this stage was suggestive of ocular lymphoblastosis. Radiotherapy to the lesion (total dose, 1 200 rads) was quickly followed by resolution without sequelae. No relapse was observed during the following 30 months, till death. The ocular disease remained the only manifestation of leukaemia during its evolution. A haematological relapse occurred 11 months after cure of the iritis, followed 1 year later by a second, treatment-sensitive relapse, and finally by a third, fatal relapse.

The three patients with CML had elevated peripheral blood golony-forming cells (CFCs) and/or normal or decreased bone marrow CFCs (in those studied). Colony-stimulating activity (CSA) was markedly decreased or absent at diagnosis in all three. Maturation of myeloid cells eithin the colonies in agar was normal, indicating that no block in myeloid maturation was present. These findings are in general agreement with results previously reported in untreated adults with Ph1 chromosome-positive CML and further define the similarity with the adult form of the disease. One Ph1 chromosome-negative patient with a clinically similar chronic myeloproliferative disorder was studied and had similarly elevated peripheral blood CFCs. She had normal CSA with a similarly high WBC count. This finding was unexpected and suggests that, unlike the patients with CML, her monocytes were capable of elaboration CSA.
