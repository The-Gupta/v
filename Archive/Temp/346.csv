Inhibition by bleomycin increased the Km for template DNA but not that for dTTP. Increasing amounts of bleomycin did not affect the Vmax for DNA polymerase alpha or beta when the amount of template DNA was varied but it reduced the Vmax for these enzymes when dTTP was varied. Moreover, the addition of extra template reversed the bleomycin inhibition but the addition of extra enzyme did not. Although dithiothreitol was required for bleomycin inhibition of DNA polymerase activity, bleomycin preincubated with dithiothreitol (or beta-mercaptoethanol) at pH 6.5 to 9.0 lost its inhibitory activity. This was not the case when DNA was also included in the preincubation mixture.

The levels of enzyme activity and p30 protein were both 30-40% relative to the control over an 8 hr period, whereas after 3 or 4 hr infectivity was reduced by 95%. Thus, virions produced in the absence of RNA synthesis represent a fairly homogeneous population of defective particles. Although RNA synthesis is not necessary for virus assembly, protein synthesis is required. Treatment of cells with 10 mug/ml of cycloheximide reduced virus production by 80-85% within 2 hr, and by greater than 95% at later times. As might be expected from this finding, viral protein synthesis accompanies virus assembly in actinomycin D-treated cells. Newly synthesized proteins associated with the defective particles were identical with those found in standard virions and were present in the correct proportions. The results demonstrate that viral mRNA persists in cells in which RNA synthesis is blocked and continues to direct viral protein synthesis with a functional half-life of approximately 6-8 hr.

These particles, tentatively called bovine leukemia virus (BLV), have a high molecular weight RNA-reverse transcriptase complex and a density of 1.155 g/ml in sucrose solutions. Molecular hybridizations between BLV/[3H]cDNA and several viral RNAs show that BLV is not related to Mason-Pfizer monkey virus, simian sarcoma associated virus, feline leukemia virus, or avian myeloblastosis virus. These results were confirmed by hybridization between BLV 70S RNA and [3H]cDNA synthesized in the various viruses tested. The high preference of BLV reverse transciptase for Mg++ as the divalent cation suggests that BLV might be an atypical mammalian leukemogenic ""type C"" virus.

Vinyl polymers themselves cannot act as templates for the polymerase. However, if a vinyl polymer is added to a polymerase reaction mixture in which a complementary polynucleotide serves as the template, the reaction is inhibited: thus with polyribocytidylic acid as template and oligodeoxyguanylic acid as primer, neither poly(vU) nor poly(vA) had a significant effect; when polyribouridylic acid was used as template and oligodeoxyadenylic acid as primer, poly(vA) inhibited polymerase activity while poly(vU) had little effect; when polyriboadenylic acid was a template and oligodeoxy thymidylic acid was a primer, poly(vU) was an inhibitor. Complex effects were noted with the latter system and poly(vA); either stimulation or inhibition of the reaction was observed, depending on the concentration of poly(vA).

With 30% dimethyl sulfoxide, the majority of DNA polymerase and RNase H activities as well as the alpha subunit were displaced from the alpha beta DNA polymerase position on phosphocellulose (0.23 M potassium phosphate) to the alpha DNA polymerase position (0.1 M). The association of DNA polymerase and RNase H activities with the alpha subunit suggests that alpha is the enzymatically active subunit in alpha beta. In addition to alpha DNA polymerase, a minor polymerase species eluted from phosphocellulose at 0.4 M potassium phosphate.

In contrast to the results with the alpha subunit, there was no correlation between DNA polymerase and RNase H activity profiles and the elution profile of the beta subunit from phosphocellulose.

The agents that cause spontaneous feline leukemias, lymphomas, and fibrosarcomas, the feline leukemia and sarcoma viruses, are well characterized. A specific tumor cell membrane antigen, designated the feline oncornavirus-associated cell membrane antigen (FOCMA) has also been described. Feline leukemia and feline sarcoma viruses are antigenically indistinguishable, and FOCMA is common for both. Both laboratory-induced and spontaneous feline leukemias, lymphomas, and fibrosarcomas are available for study. A clear correlation has been shown between the resistance of cats to development of lethal tumors following inoculation of feline sarcoma virus and the presence of high humoral antibody titers to FOCMA. The geometric mean antibody titer to FOCMA for cats that resisted growth of fibrosarcomas was more than 20-fold higher than the mean for cats that succumbed to lethally progressing tumors. Cats with induced or spontaneous leukemia or lymphoma also have either no detectable FOCMA antibody or very low levels. Conversely, some cats resist development of leukemia or lymphoma following natural exposure to feline leukemia virus in leukemia cluster households, and these cats have high FOCMA antibody titers. These results support the concept of a natural immunosurveillance mechanism against leukemia or lymphoma development in an outbred mammalian species.",,,,,,

Possible mechanisms for in vivo protection in two tumor systems are discussed. These tumor models, which are a Friend leukemia virus-induced transplantable tumor, FBL-3, and primary murine sarcoma virus (MSV) -induced tumors, are strongly antigenic; under some conditions, tumors regress completely. In mice with regressing FBL-3 tumors, cell-mediated cytotoxicity was measured by release of [125I]iododeoxyuridine. The response was biphasic, with an initial peak at 10 days and a 2nd peak after 30 days. A boost in reactivity could be elicited by later challenge with tumor cells. All of the reactivity was dependent on T-cells, being eliminated by treatment with anti-theta plus complement. The specificity of the reactions was not completely defined, but it was consistent with Friend type-specific antigen plus broader, common antigens. In mice with regressing MSV tumors, strong cell-mediated cytotoxicity, measured mainly by release of 51Cr, was seen against RBL-5, a Rauscher virus-induced leukemia. A single peak of response occurred at about 14 days after virus inoculation. Upon later challenge with RBL-5 cells, a vigorous and rapid secondary response was elicited, mainly in the region of tumor challenge. This cytotoxic reactivity and in vivo resistance to leukemia.lso was completely dependent on T-cells. In addition, macrophage-mediated inhibition of leukemia cell growth in vitro was seen in this system at the time of peak tumor development. The 51Cr release cytotoxicity was specific and directed primarily against an antigen, MEV-SA1, associated with mouse endogenous C-type viruses. The macrophage-induced growth inhibition appeared to be nonspecific. In both the FBL-3 and MSV tumor systems, protection against tumor growth could be adoptively transferred by immune lymphoid cells. In addition to induction of cell-mediated immunity by tumor cell or virus inoculation, cell-mediated cytotoxic reactivity was found to occur naturally in most young mice. This natural killer activity was quite distinct from the experimentally elicited reactions, being mediated by N-cells, a subpopulation of lymphoid cells with no clearly identifiable cell surface markers. The natural cytotoxicity was also directed against antigenic specificities different from those recognized by the MSV-immune cells. The central issue in all of these studies has been to determine the relationships between the in vitro-detected cell-mediated reactivity and in vivo resistance to leukemia.",,,,,,

The determination of gammaglobulin using the acetate sheet electrophoreses, showed no significant change. However a significant reduction of the IgG was shown during the periods of prophylactic reinduction with Vincristin in the Pinkel VII scheme. IgM quantities were significantly raised in the initial stage before treatment and in all periodes of treatment both in the Pinkel VII group and in an earlier therapeutic group with methotrexate two weekly and Vincristin pulses every 6 weeks. IgA was raised in both groups before treatment but significantly reduced during maintenance and reinduction phases.

The greatest experience has been with Gallium-67, which has major utility in the staging of Hodgkin's disease, in the diagnosis of bronchogenic carcinoma, in the detection of certain metastatic brain tumors, in the identification of recurrent disease, and in the noninvasive diagnosis of leukemic complications. A number of radiolabeled antibiotic and chemotherapeutic agents have shown promise, including tetracycline and bleomycin. A major drawback, however, of these agents which is shared with Gallium-67 is that they appear to be sequestered by inflammatory as well as neoplastic tissue. A most intriguing approach is the use of radiolabeled antibodies to tumor-associated antigens.

Silver deposits, indicative of sites of arginine-rich histone within nuclei, were not observed in proerythroblasts from any of the individuals. Small deposits of silver were seen in the heterochromatin in very early intermediate normoblasts. Differences in the amount and distribution of the silver deposits in the various types of erythroid precursors first became recognizable in the intermediate normoblast stage. In all of the individuals, the silver deposits were localized predominantly in the heterochromatic regions of the nucleus. In 6 patients with chronic erythremic myelosis, unusually, dense deposits of silver were observed in erythroid precursors having amounts of heterochromatin comparable to that found in intermediate normoblasts of intermediate megaloblasts in other conditions. In these chronic erythremic myelosis erythroid precursors, the silver deposits were larger and, in many instances, appeared to be more aggregated than in erythroid precursors obtained from 3 patients with untreated pernicious anemia, 2 patients with autoimmune hemolytic anemia, and 4 presumedly normal persons. It is possible that the findings described in this study are involved in the pathogenesis of megaloblastoid erythropoiesis as found in chronic erythremic myelosis.",,,PMC2032328,,,

Three rat viruses were compared in homologous and heterologous intraspecies assays with no evidence of type specificity. The only heterologous viruses to give inhibition in these species assays were the feline (FeLV) and hamster (HaLV) type C viruses; these reactions were incomplete and required high virus concentrations. An interspecies assay using a goat antiserum prepared after sequentially immunizing with FeLV, RD 114, and woolly monkey virus p30's and labeled RaLV p30 was inhibited by all mammalian type C viruses, although preferentially by RaLV, FeLV, and HaLV. Thus, as in a previously reported assay developed with HaLV p30, rat, hamster, and cat p30's seem more closely related to each other than to mouse type C virus p30. High levels of specific antigen were found in all cell lines producing rat virus, whereas embryonic tissues from several rat strains and cell lines considered virus-free based on other tests were negative for p30. Rats bearing tumors containing Moloney murine sarcoma virus (RaLV) did not contain free circulating antibody to RaLV p30.

At a sensitivity level of 7 ng/ml (0.7 ng/assay) in the interspecies assay, all human tissues, with one exception, were negative.

It was found that the secondary cell-mediated cytotoxic response occurred more rapidly after challenge (within 3 days) than the primary response, and the levels of reactivity were considerably higher. As in the primary response, the secondary cytotoxic reactivity of spleen cells was T cell dependent, being eliminated by pretreatment with anti-theta antibody plus complement. However, the secondary reactivity of pertioneal exudate (PE) cells was not entirely T-cell dependent. The specificity of the secondary cytotoxic response was analyzed by primary or secondary immunization with various tumor cells and by testing of cytotoxic lymphocytes against a variety of target cells. When spleen cells were used for testing, only tumor cells induced by Friend, Moloney, or Rauscher (FMR) leukemia viruses could produce secondary cell-mediated cytotoxic responses against FBL-3 cells. This correlated well with the specificity observed in the in vivo tumor transplantation protection studies. Similarly, spleen cells immune to FBL-3 had appreciable cytotoxicity against tumor cells induced by FMR viruses. The FBL-3 immune mice also gave significant protection against the challenge of FMR leukemias. When PE cells were used for testing, they gave higher levels of cytotoxicity against tumor cells induced by FMR viruses, but also gave less, but appreciable, cytotoxicity against non-FMR tumors.

After proper absorption the antiserum was non-toxic for chronic lymphatic leukaemia cells, but lysed the majority of thymocytes. It also lysed some of peripheral lymphocytes, corresponding to those lymphocytes which bound sheep erythrocytes (E) but not erythrocyte-antibody-complement complexes (EAC). Pretreatment of lymphocytes with the absorbed antiserum and complement completely abrogated rosette formation with E but spared EAC-binding lymphocytes. It also eliminated their reactivity to phytohaemagglutinin and concanavalin A. These findings indicate that the absorbed serum causes selective lysis of T cells.

On the contrary, the T-cell class is apparently normal and the T cell extent in CLL-peripheral blood can be even greater than normal when taken as absolute value. The clonal nature theory of B-lymphocytes in CLL is substantiated by the fact that, in general, in every patient only one Ig light chain determinant is present. Again, when serum Ig monoclonality is present in CLL, it appears idiotypically identical to the Ig shown by the lymphocytes of the same patient. Among the most important B-lymphocyte abnormalities in CLL, there are: (a) fluorescence of surface Ig is usually less intense than that in normal subjects, and fluorescence intensity may vary not only from patient to patient, but also from cell to cell in the same patient; (b) the Fc-receptor can be lacking; (c) the C3b-receptor is not always present, or it is from 2 to 20 folds less frequent than the C3d-receptor, whereas normal human lymphocytes do not show any outstanding differences between the number of EAC rosette-forming cells either when tested with mouse complement (C3d-receptor) or with human complement (C3b-receptor); (d) the traffic capacity of peripheral-blood B-lymphocytes in CLL is quite defective.

These antisera are not cytotoxic to cells from patients with acute myelocytic leukemia (AML), acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), or to peripheral blood lymphocytes from normal donors. A goat antiserum to gradient purified FLV in addition to reacting with cells from CGL and AMML donors also reacted with cells from AML patients and some ALL donors. However, this antiserum failed to react with cells from CLL patients. Peripheral blood and bone marrow leukocytes prepared from leukemic patients in clinical remission failed to react with antisera to FLV and FLV gp71. Absorption experiments demonstrated that the antigen on CGL cells which is reacting with the antiserum to FLV gp71 is also present on normal human platelets and neutrophils. Similar absorption studies showed that the antigen on AML cells detected by the FLV antiserum is not present on normal leukocytes and platelets and appears to be related to the major internal p30 antigens of mammalian RNA tumor viruses. Another antigenic relationship between oncornaviruses and membrane antigens of human leukemia cells was shown by the ability of FLV antigens to absorb the cytotoxic reactivity of nonhuman primate antisera detecting human leukemia-associated antigens. FLV and FLV gp71 antigens were able to absorb all cytotoxic activity of monkey and chimpanzee antisera to human myeloid leukemia antigens when these antisera were tested with CGL cells. These two approaches to an analysis of cross-reactivity indicate that the antigenic determinant(s) detected by the cytotoxic reactions of the FLV gp71 antiserum with human CGL cells is different from the determinant on FLV gp71 which is responsible for the inhibition of the reactivity of simian antisera with CGL cells. Since the goat and rabbit antisera to FLV and FLV gp71 are able to distinguish AML from CGL cells by direct cytotoxicity testing and absorption, they may be valuable reagents for the serological diagnosis of myeloid leukemia. In addition, since peripheral blood cells from AML and CGL patients in clinical remission were seronegative, the antisera may be valuable as management aids. The data in this report indicates that whatever the mechanism of leukemogenesis is in man, cells from CGL and AML patients possess certain membrane antigens which cross-react with FLV structural components such as p30 and gp71.",,['10.1084/jem.143.1.47 [doi]'],PMC2190099,,,

The reactivities of this natural antibody to viral envelope antigens of two laboratory strains (Rauscher and Moloney) and two endogenous mouse C-type viruses (AKR and BALB:virus-2) were further analyzed and compared by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Similar patterns of antibody reactivities to AKR MuLV and the two member viruses of the Friend-Moloney-Rauscher group were found. Three major antigenic determinants of the virus envelope, gp71, gp43, and p15, were recognized by and precipitated natural antibody. In all viruses examined, normal B6C3F1 sera precipitated comparable amounts of gp71 and gp43. However, compared with the other viruses, the amount of p15 (relative to the glycoproteins) precipitating from BALB:virus-2 was significantly lower. This appears to be due to a lesser amount of p15 on the xenotropic virus. While heterologous antisera to purified gp71 and p15 of MuLV reacted to a certain degree with rhabdomyosarcoma virus 114 and rat leukemia virus, natural mouse antibody did not. These results suggest that MuLV have common antigenic determinants recognized by natural antibody, and that the reactivities of natural antibody in an autogenous immune response are restrictive in contrast to immune antibody produced in a heterologous host.",,['10.1093/jnci/55.4.831 [doi]'],,,,

In our hands at concentrations of greater than 0.2 mug/ml release occurs in 1 to 2 min, is blocked by metabolic inhibitors, and is unaccompanied by cytotoxicity (trypan-blue uptake, lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) release). At higher doses (0.5 mug/ml) histamine release is followed by significant cytotoxicity, but again Ca++ is required. In parallel studies, we examined cultured rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-1) cells. These cells, which apparently have normal surface receptors for IgE, contained approximately 700 ng histamine/10(6) cells but did not release histamine when IgE-mediated release was looked for. They do not respond to doses of ionophore which would be expected to give non-cytotoxic histamine release. At higher doses histamine release is preceded by progressive LDH release: LDH release is 75% complete at 5 min whereas 10 min are required for 75% maximal histamine release. This reaction requires Ca++ and is temperature dependent but is not inhibited by metabolic poisons (2-deoxyglucose, dinitrophenol, CN-). These studies suggest that either Ca++ does not enter into these cells normally or that one or more mechanisms which are ordinarily triggered by the changes in Ca++ flow are unresponsive in the RBL-1 cells.

This is also true for the corresponding tumours, especially malignant lymphomata. In studies of 106 cases of malignant lymphoma we therefore applied as morphological methods haematological staining (Giemsa in sections and imprints) and electron microscopic analysis. As functional criteria we used the nonspecific esterase reaction to define tumours of histiocytes and an estimation of the immunoglobulin content of tissue extracts and single cells to define tumours of B lymphocytes and their derivatives. By combining all of these methods it was possible to propose a new classification. Whereas not one histiocytic malignant lymphoma (""reticulosarcoma"") was found in the series, at least most of the malignant lymphomata investigated seemed to be derived from the B lymphocyte system. The following types are distinguished: (1) Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia; (2) diffuse germinocytoma (malignant lymphoma, lymphocytic, intermediate); (3) germinoblastoma (follicular, follicular and diffuse, diffuse; sclerotic, nonsclerotic) which can show a transition into germinoblastic sarcoma; (4) immunoblastic sarcoma of the B cell type (previously called reticulo-sarcoma); (5) lymphoplasmocytoid immunocytoma, which may be associated with Waldenstrom's macroglobulinaemia and can show a mixed cellularity; (6) lymphoblastic (paraleukoblastic) sarcoma and leukaemia, which are, at least in most cases, probably neoplasias of germinoblasts. All of these lymphomata can produce immunoglobulins. Sixty-seven cases showed an Ig increase in the tumour. This was mostly IgM, but sometimes IgG, IgA, IgD and/or IgE. A morphological equivalent of even abnormal Ig secretion is the globular positive (diastase resistant) PAS reaction in lymphoid cells (not in the histiocytes) in paraffin sections, which we found in 43 cases. Only 19 of the 63 cases with an IgM increase in the tumour showed an increase of IgM in the serum. Waldenstrom's macroglobulinaemia is a facultative symptom of morphologically different malignant lymphomata and should therefore be considered only as a clinical syndrome and not as a nosological entity.",,,PMC2149614,,,

Gibbon and woolly viruses, as well as feline and several mouse type-C viruses, all reacted with equal efficiency in this assay. In contrast, an endogenous virus of the baboon failed to cross-react, suggesting that viruses of this latter group are less immunologically related to the others.

These changes of the hematological picture are associated with alterations of the karyotype and with cytochemical abnormalities of the blast cells, possibly related to their metabolic anomalies. In this regard 14 patients with blastic crisis were investigated to achieve an evaluation of the composition of the cell population during the acute phase. A sequence of three cytochemical reactions applied consecutively on the same slide (alpha-naphthyl-acetate esterase + AS D-chloro-acetate esterase + PAS) proved to be useful for the detection of differently oriented blast cells. During the acute phase of chronic myeloid leukemia only about one half of the blast cells were expressing granuloblastic differentiation.

New Bolton Center (NBC) cell lines, of peripheral lymphocytes from leukemic cattle and in short-term cultures of bovine buffy coat(BC) cells share an immunofluorescent(IF)antigen detected in the cytoplasm of infected cells as well as an antigen demonstrable in gel diffusion experiments. Therefore the viruses from these cultures most likely represent different isolates of the putative bovine leukemia virus (BLV). The BLV precipitin antigen is analogous to the group specific (gs) antigens of the leukemia viruses of other species in that it is soluble, ether resistant, and apparently located within the virion. These observations, together with results showing that the specificity of the BLV precipitin antigen differs from that of the gs antigen of other mammalian leukemia viruses, indicate that the former antigen represents the intraspecies (gs-1) determinant of BLV. Antibodies to the precipitin viral antigen were found in 82% of cattle with leukemia and in 40% of clinically normal adult cattle in multiple-case herds. These groups of animals also had fluorescent antibodies to the virus, but with significantly higher frequencies (100% and 76%, respectively).

By contrast, lymphoma cells derived from the same parental cell line and morphologically indistinguishable, that have lost both surface and cytoplasmic antigenic expression were accepted and grew progressively at primary and metastatic sites.

The pattern of specific RNAs found in the human tumors showed a remarkable concordance with the predictions deducible from the animal systems. Thus human breast cancer contains RNA homologous only to that of the murine mammary tumor virus (MMTV). Human leukemias, sarcomas, and lymphomas (including Hodgkin's and Burkitt's) all contain RNA with sequence homology to the murine leukemia virus (RLV) and not to MMTV RNA. Finally, as in the case of the mouse, none of the human tumors examined contain RNA related in sequence to that of the avian myeloblastosis virus (AMV). The RNA detected in all of the human neoplasias was demonstrated to be of high molecular weight (1 times 10(7) daltons) and encapsulated with a reverse transcriptase in particles having densities between 1.16-1.19 g/ml. Further, the RNA of these human tumor particles was related in sequence to the murine viruses that cause the corresponding neoplasias in mice. Thus, 4 features diagnostic for the murine oncogenic viruses are satisfied by the particles found in the human cancers. Finally, it was shown by ""recycling"" experiments that the DNA from human leukemic cells and from lymphomatous tissue contained particle-related sequences that could not be detected in normal DNA. This finding was further substantiated by studies with identical twins in which it was shown that the leukemic twin contained particle-related sequences that could not be detected in the leukocytes of his identical healthy sibling. These findings are inconsistent with hypotheses that require chromosomal transmission in the germ line of complete copies of the information required to produce malignancy and the associated virus particles.",,['10.1159/000397514 [doi]'],,,,

A minimal radiation dose was used to replication-block EL 4 cells before inoculation, as defined by dose-response analysis of irradiated EL 4 cells. Multiple ip injections of irradiated EL 4 cells stimulated development of significant, yet relatively low, levels of cytotoxic lymphoid activity (CLA) in lymphoid cells of the peritoneal exudate as measured by in vitro 51Cr-release cytotoxicity assays. The specific temporal and frequency dependencies of the inoculation regimen for achieving immunoprophylaxis indicated that, in addition to CLA, other, short-lived, immune processes were important in the tumor rejection. These observations showed the capacity of the C57BL/6J host for tumor-specific immune recognition and rejection of the syngeneic EL 4 leukemia. The tumor rejection could be elicited solely by inoculations of irradiated EL 4 cells and did not require exogenous amplifiers, such as immunoadjuvants, chemical modifiers, and/or allogeneic immune information transfer.",,['10.1093/jnci/55.3.561 [doi]'],,,,

Presuming that a maximal FP4 release of the irreversible platelet aggregation must be obtained, which corresponds to the real activity, the author has examined the apparent activity of FP4 released from the aggregated platelets with the help of her own method. In this way the quality of the release reaction from the platelets can indirectly be characterized with their extremely important role for haemostasis. Whereas in exacerbated myeloid leukaemia and Willebrand's syndrome the apparent activity will correspond to the real one, there is a severe specific disturbance of the platelet release response in blastic leukaemia. The platelet aggregation is incomplete caused by the derailment of the energy metabolism and the disturbance of the adenine nucleotides, thus causing an apparent as well as a real FP4 deficiency which can be brought into the same line with pathogenesis of thrombopathy in blastic leukaemia.",,,,,,

Avian myeloblastosis virus (AMV) contains two forms of RNA-directed DNA polymerase, alpha, consisting of a single polypeptide of molecular weight 65,000, and alphabeta, consisting of two polypeptides of molecular weights 65,000 and 105,000. The alpha and alphabeta forms of AMV DNA polymerase both possess RNase H activity that requires free end termini on the ribopolymer and can degrade the RNA of the RNA-DNA hybrid in the 3' to 5' and 5' to 3' directions. But, alpha and alphabeta possess a different mode of exoribonuclease activity. While alphabeta RNase H is a processive exoribonuclease that degrades the polynucleotide chain to a core residue before attacking a second chain, alpha RNase H is a random exoribonuclease that releases the polynucleotide after each scission. Highly purified Moloney-MSV(MLV) DNA polymerase has both RNase H activity and the ability to read viral 60-70S RNA. These activities comigrate through five different steps of purification and are present at levels comparable to those found in purified AMV DNA polymerase. The MSV(MLV) 60-70S RNA genome and 35S RNA subunits were shown by periodate oxidationtritiated borohydride reduction to contain adenosine as the major 3'-terminal nucleoside. Poly (A) segments were isolated from viral 60-70S and 35S RNA by treatment with RNase A or RNase T1 and purified by afinity chromatography and gel electrophoresis. Viral poly(A) was shown to be present at the 3' terminus as -G(C,U)A190AOH. The similar sequence reported for poly(A) present in mammalian mRNA suggests that similar mechanisma are involved in the transcription and processing of both cellular and viral DNA sequences. Within transformed cells replicating MSV(MLV), viral 35S and 20S RNA were found in membrane-bound polyribosomes, whereas only 35S RNA was detected in free polyribosomes. The origin and function of 20S RNA is unknown. The early events during rapid infection and cell transformation of mouse 3T6 cells by the Harvey strain of MSV(MLV) were studied. By both autoradiographic analysis and molecular hybridization, viral DNA synthesis was detected in the cytoplasm by 1 hour after infection, reached a maximum at 2 hours, and subsequently decreased. Cytological chase experiments produced evidence that cytoplasmic viral DNA was transported to the nucleus. In situ hybridization experiments using radioactive viral DNA product as a probe demonstrated the rapid association of viral DNA sequences with the chromocenters of interphase nuclei and with the centromeric heterochromatin regions of some chromosomes.",,['10.1101/sqb.1974.039.01.112 [doi]'],,,,

With the use of relatively pure virus concentrates, partial characterization of the virus has been accomplished. Up to 60 liters of spent culture medium from relatively low virus-yielding cultures were processed at a time through the Model K ultracentrifuge in order to obtain quantities of virus sufficient for convenient Tween-ether extraction of the major polypeptide (30,000 daltons). This structural protein having group-specific reactivity was purified and isolated by isoelectric-focusing techniques. A UV absorption peak (A280) was found to be coincident with a major peak of radioacticity at pH 8.6, the isoelectric point (pI) for rat virus gs antigen previously reported by other investigators. Because species-specific (gs-1) and cross-reactive (gs-3) determinants coexist on this protein, fractions containing the group-specific antigen were identified on the basis of the mammalian interspecies determinant (gs-3), using antiserum prepared against Tween-ether-disrupted feline leukemia virus. At the same time, reactivity to the gs-1 determinants in identical fractions was observed in complement fixation and gel diffusion assays, using guinea pig antiserum known to contain principally antibodies to rat gs-1 determinants. Presently, the principal source of rat type C viral gs antigen is rat cell line MSB, which continuously releases a rat leukemia virus pseudotype of murine sarcoma virus. The WR-9 rat virus line may be of use in providing an additional source of C-type particles that are capable of yielding good gs reagents.",,,,,,

Nitrosocarbaryl, but not carbaryl, caused transformation of the BALB/3T3 fibroblasts, but neither chemical induced the complete expression of endogenous murine leukemia virus. Transformed cells differed from the parental control cells by loss of contact inhibition, change in morphology, growth in soft agar, growth to higher saturation densities, and tumorigenicity in normal newborn and irradiated weanling mice and athymic (nude) mice. Transformed clones were found to be negative for expression of RNA tumor virus antigens, viral reverse transcriptase, and infectious virus. Thus, it appears that nitrosocarbaryl can transform BALB/3T3 cells to tumorigenic cells with altered biological properties but without complete activation of RNA tumor viruses in the transformed cells. Expression of viral antigen in the transformed cells was inducible by iododeoxyuridine, indicating that the endogenous viral genome was retained in an unexpressed state.",,,,,,

This antiserum has been shown to recognize p30, the major internal virion protein, as a cytotoxic target on these cells. Viral particles were identified by electron microscopic examination of pelleted material obtained from leukaemic sera after high speed centrifugation. However, removal of virus did not affect the capacity of the leukaemic sera to absorb cytotoxicity of rat ILR-3 for MSC targets, and only depressed somewhat its ability to absorb activity of the same antisera against M targets. Virus-free leukaemic sera also blocks complement dependent antibody mediated cytotoxicity of an antiserum prepared in goats against the gs3 determinant of p30. This indicates that the material in leukaemic sera responsible for the in vitro block of antibody mediated cytotoxicity was p30.

It differs from other endogenous murine C-type viruses which are ecotropic, i.e. infectious for cells of their home species. Xenotropic viruses are detected in embryos and adult tissues of other strains of mice but at less frequency and titer than in NZB mice. Moreover, natural anti-X-tropic virus neutralizing activity which is present in all mouse sera, is found in significantly higher titers in NZB mouse sera. A working hypothesis is that the X-tropic virus is an important agent for normal development and differentiation, but in NZB mice its increased expression results in autoimmune disease.

For the next 60 passages, the cultures were heteroploid, but retained contact inhibition and were not tumorigenic. Even without addition of heterotypic viruses, these heteroploid cultures could be transformed by chemicals, but the endogenous rat C-type virus could be demonstrated in the transformed cultures. At higher passages, the rates of spontaneous transformation gradually increased so that the cultures could not be used for transformation studies. Chemically induced transformation of the stable heteroploid cell line (F1706) was manifested by an easy to read focal alteration. Initial observations based on these foci were confirmed by inoculating the morphologically altered cells into isogeneic newborn rats.

The compounds tested included 4 azo dyes, 12 polycyclic hydrocarbons, 12 aromatic amines, and 7 miscellaneous compounds.

The macromolecule, designated as mercaptopolycytidylic acid (MPC), is a chemically modified polycytidylic acid containing 5-SH cytidylic bases in the polymerase. Partially thiolated polycytidylic acids (MPC I-III, containing 1.7%, 3.5%, and 8.6% 5-mercaptocytidylate units, respectively) inhibited the DNA-polymerase of Friend leukemia virus (FVL) in the endogenic reaction as well as in the presence of poly rA-(dT)14 or poly (dA-dT) templates; the inhibitory activities were directly related to the percent of tholation. In a bacterial DNA polymerase (E coli-K12 with denatured calf thymus DNA as template) MPCI-III showed no activity. Biological experiments showed that MPC III inhibits the leukemogenic potential of cell-free spleen extracts from FVL-infected mice to about 60%, measured on the basis of spleen weight. The enzymatic and animal experiments have led us to carry out preliminary clinical trials in some cases of Children leukemia. These cases, resistent to the known therapeutic regimes (combination chemotherapy), responded well when treated with MPC along, or in combination with poly I. The experiments indicate that the development of modified polynucleotids with structural similarities to functional templates may be of potential use in the future chemotherapy of leukemia.",,['10.1007/BF00304094 [doi]'],,,,

Splenectomy was performed in 84 of these 86 patients. There was complete or partial correction of the haematological defect in 90% of the H.D. patients and 89% of the non-Hodgkin patients. Chemotherapy or radiotherapy was started after the haematological defect had been corrected by splenectomy, and as a result 79% of the H.D. patients and 75% of the non-Hodgkin patients had a complete or partial remission of their disease. Increased splenic activity should be considered as a cause of a haematological cytopenia in patients with malignant lymphomas even in those with bone-marrow involvement, since splenectomy is accompanied by excellent results in terms of disease remission with subsequent therapy. 2 patients with H.D.

The studies reported here were directed towards answering two questions. (1) How long an exposure to DMSO is necessary to induce the differentiation of these cells; and (2) What is the fate of the differentiating cells when DMSO is removed from the medium. Exposure to DMSO for less than 24 hours failed to produce any detectable evidence of erythroid differentiation. On the other hand, culture in the presence of DMSO for 24 hours followed by culture in DMSO-free medium for four additional days produced a small but detectable increment in the proportion of benzidine positive cells in the culture. Once the differentiation of an individual cell was initiated, the process continued after removal of DMSO from the medium. The cell became progressively more differentiated as evidenced by increases in the intensity of benzidine staining as well as the rate of heme synthesis and heme content. However, when cells which had been induced to differentiate by DMSO were cultured in DMSO-free medium for more than 3--4 days, they became vacuolated and apparently died. This latter phenomenon, as well as the more rapid proliferation of the undifferentiated cells in the culture, accounts for the observation that when new cultures are established from cultures which have been grown in the presence of DMSO for several days, the culture which results ultimately contains only differentiated cells.",,['10.1002/jcp.1040850305 [doi]'],,,,

As compared with normal individuals CLL patients had an increased percentage of lymphocytes with membrane-bound immunoglobulins, whereas the proportion of rosette-forming lymphocytes was reduced. In Hodgkin's disease either normal, diminished, or increased B cell values were obtained; the percentage of T cells was decreased or within the lower range of normals. Lymphocyte transformation by various mitogenic agents in vitro may be regarded as a model of lymphocyte reactivity during immunologic processes in vivo. In order to study the functional capacity of lymphocytes in CLL and Hodgkin's disease in comparison with normal cells, purified peripheral blood lymphocytes from normals and patients with these diseases were incubated in vitro with phytohemagglutinin (PHA) and pokeweed mitogen (PWM) over 7 to 11 days. DNA synthesis was determined by incorporation of 3-H-thymidine. The cyto-architectural features of the cells before and during incubation with these phytomitogens were studied by electron microscopy. Planimetric measurements were performed on micrographs of comparable cell sections (through nucleus and Golgi zone) for the determiniation of cell, nuclear, cytoplasmic, and mitochondrial area. Furthermore, the number of mitochondria and of membrane-bounded acid phosphatase-positive lysosome-like organelles was determined in comparable sections of unstimulated and mitogen transformed lymphocytes.",,,,,,

YC hybrids, derived from the fusion of C1.1D and L1210 clls, failed to induce any tumor in adult mice, while 91% of x-irradiated newborn mice developed tumors and died. Some telocentric chromosomes were lacking in hybrid tumors; however, none of the immunologically intact adult mice developed tumors when grafted with tumors grown in x-irradiated newborn mice. This indicates that histocompatibility factors interfered in the failure of YC tumors to grow to adult hosts. Syngeneic F1 mice immunized with Y2C hybrid cells had cytotoxic antibodies against Y2C hybrids and C1.1D and L1210 parental cells. Complete absorption of cytotoxic antibodies directed against hybrid cells by mixtures of both parental cell lines demonstrates the absence of any new antigen on hybrid cells.Hyb rid cells had a higher density of C1.1D-tumor antigenic sites, as compared to C1.1D parental cells.

The immunoglobulin is seen to be synthesized when the cells are maintained in culture, indicating its intrinsic origin. Immunolabelling of the cell surface and immunochemical study of the Fab released by limited surface proteolysis indicate the presence of immunoglobulin of class IgM. IgG and free light chains were not detected, and there is unlikely to be an appreciable amount of immunoglobulin of any other class. The amount of immunoglobulin present, in terms of 4-chain monomers, is approximately 100,000 molecules per cell. Its half-life, calculated from the rate of reappearance in vitro of surface Fab after proteolytic clearing, is approximately 5 hours. Immunoglobulin secreted into the environment appears to arise predominantly or entirely from the cell surface: there is no evidence of an appreciable export of immunoglobulin which does not have a surface phase. Papain at 0.06 mg/ml rapidly removes the surface Fab. Residual Fcmu can then be detected by immunofluorescence, suggesting that papain cleaves surface IgM at a hinge region with the molecule in situ on the membrane. The released Fab is only moderately susceptible to degradation by papain at the enzyme: substrate ratio prevailing. It has been possible to isolate it from the papain digest by immuno-adsorption, with a notional yield of 75 mug per 10-10 cells, and then to prepare antisera against it.",,,PMC1445912,,,

Electron microscopy was used to characterize the ultrastructural features of normal and neoplastic prostatic tissue. Examination of specimens of prostatic tissue from 34 patients with PrCa, ten patients with BPH, and three patients with bladder tumor (BT) revealed the presence of particles resembling type-C virus in three cases of PrCa and structures resembling budding type-C virus particles in one case of BPH. Fifty human prostatic tissue specimens have been set in tissue culture, of which 30 have been successfully grown for varying periods of time. Of 20 currently active cultures, nine consist primarily of epithelial cells. Immunofluorescence and mixed hemadsorption tests of cells derived from benign and malignant prostatic tissue and sera derived from patients with PrCa, BPH, BT, and other types of tumors, and from normal donors revealed that sera from patients with PrCa, BPH, or BT contain antibodies to antigens in cells derived from PrCa, BPH, or BT. The nature of these antigen-antibody reactions is under study. Initial biochemical studies have not detected reverse transcriptase in the tissue culture fluid from a small number of sparsely growing PrCa cultures nor specific gene sequences homologous to murine leukemia virus-Rauscher genomic RNA in preparations of either normal or malignant prostatic cell DNA. The results of these preliminary studies have demonstrated the applicability of the techniques employed to the study of the relationship of viruses to human PrCa and have provided a number of promising leads for further investigation.",,,,,,

This model is based upon the capacity of the adult mouse to prevent the progressive growth of tumors induced by the Moloney sarcoma virus. Two steroids reported to have immunosuppressive activity in other assay systems, namely, cortisol and progesterone, were also studied. Control mice and those injected with CHP maintained their capacity to reject the tumor. In contrast, significant numbers of mice receiving a single large injection of cortisol or progesterone succumbed to progressive tumor growth under the experimental conditions used. The data indicate that CHP, while influencing selected parameters of cellular immunity, e.g., the elicitation of delayed hypersensitivity, does not decrease the capacity of the host to mount a defense against the progressive growth of the Moloney virus-induced sarcoma. The results indicate that CHP may be useful in modulating specific aspects of cellular immunity without altering others. In addition, the experimental model described provides a simple method of assessing the possible immunosuppressive effects of naturally occurring and synthetic agents on viral-induced tumor growth.",,['10.3181/00379727-148-38503 [doi]'],,,,

The reverse transcriptases from mammalian type-C viruses have with one exception (see text) been isolated as enzymes with molecular weights of 70,000. In this study, the reverse transcriptase from extracellular gibbon ape leukemia virus was also isolated only as the LMW class. However, the enzyme from gibbon virus-producing cells was isolated partially in the HMW form; this form was converted completely to the LMW form by treatment with 0.5 M KC1 and 0.5% Triton X-100 and could be re-converted to the HMW form by lowering the KC1 and Triton X-100 concentrations. A similar conversion from a HMW form to a LMW form was demonstrated with enzyme from human leukemic cells. The LMW form of the human and gibbon ape cellular enzymes utilized synthetic primer-templates in a similar fashion to viral enzyme, and this form was strongly inhibited by antisera (IgG) to reverse transcriptase from simian (woolly monkey) type-C virus. The HMW form of both enzymes utilized synthetic primer-templates less efficiently than the LMW form, and was resistant to inhibition by antipolymerase IgG of simian type-C virus. The HMW form of the cellular reverse transcriptases transcribed viral 70S RNA in the absence of synthetic primer relatively more efficiently than did the extracellular viral form. These data suggest that the HMW form is due in part to aggregation of the LMW form and in part to a cellular factor(s) which may affect both the form and function of intracellular reverse transciptase.",,['10.1073/pnas.72.3.1194 [doi]'],PMC432493,,,

Regression of splenic tumor was accompanied by the loss of both specific FV-induced cell membrane antigen (FVMA) and virus group-specific antigens (gsa) from the spleen cells. The frequency (percentage) of immunoglobulin-positive cells (B) and thetapositive cells (T) in the spleen was markedly decreased during leukemia progression, but there was a subsequent increase during regression. The appearance of gsa-positive (gsa+) cells in peripheral blood correlated well with the early progressive and regressive phase of leukemia (up to 7 weeks after infection). Later, the presence of these cells became unpredictable in regard to status of disease. Gsa+ blood cells reappeared in most mice with regressed splenic tumors, suggesting persistence of the virus complex in the animals. Antibody responsiveness as determined by the numbers of hemolytic plaque-forming cells, PFC, after a single immunization with sheep red blood cells (SRBC), was suppressed in leukemia progression and recovered, spontaneously, during regression of leukemia. However, hemolytic PFC elicited by antigen in both progressors and regressors expressed the specific virus-induced membrane antigen, FVMA, detectable by the PFC-inhibition test with specific antiserum and complement. Recovery of immunological responsiveness also included the spontaneous appearance of virus-neutralizing antibody to FV. However, this was not paralleled by the appearance of antibody to FVMA. Traces of anti-FVMA antibody activity were occasionally detectable in serum of both progressors and regressors and did not correlate with virus neutralization, in individual mice; This may explain the susceptibility of regressors to secondary relapse and to reinfection.",,['10.1002/ijc.2910150219 [doi]'],,,,

It can be shown that globin sequences are transcribed in vitro from embryonic liver chromatin and not brain chromatin. This specificity in liver chromatin can be reconstituted after dissociation of the structural elements of the chromatin. It can be shown that the non-histone protein fraction of liver chromatin can confer specificity for the transcription of globin sequences from brain chromatin which otherwise lacks this ability.

This hormone effect was observed at concentrations as low as 1 times 10-10 M and was maximal at 10-7 to 10-8 M. The time course of induction indicated that detectable increases in extracellular viral DNA polymerase were first noted 18 to 24 hours following the addition of dexamethasone, and cells produced the highest polymerase levels at the time monolayers approached confluence. Steroid responsiveness was associated with specific increases in type B murine mammary tumor virus structural polypeptide (gp52(sl) expression and murine mammary tumor virus RNA that quantitatively paralleled the increase in extracellular virus production as measured by electron microscopy and supernatant RNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity. Another virally transformed murine cell line, KA 31, did not contain detectable levels of murine mammary tumor virus gp52(sl) or RNA before or after dexamethasone stimulation; thus induction was noted only in murine cells with pre-existing murine mammary tumor virus expression.

Purified M-MuLV DNA polymerase, upon analysis by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, showed one major polypeptide of mol wt 80,000. Estimation of molecular weight from the sedimentation rate of the purifed enzyme in a glycerol gradient was consistent with a structure containing one polypeptide. M-MuLV DNA polymerase could transcribe ribopolymers, deoxyribopolymers, and heteropolymers as efficiently as did purified DNA polymerase from avian myeloblastosis virus (AMV). M-MuLV DNA polymerase, however, transcribed native 70S viral RNA less efficiently than did AMV DNA polymerase. Addition of oligo(dT) enhanced five to tenfold the transcription of 70S viral RNA by M-MuLV DNA polymerase. Purified enzyme also exhibited nuclease activity (RNase H) that selectively degraded the RNA moiety of the RNA-DNA hybrid. It did not degrade single-stranded RNA, single-stranded DNA, double-stranded RNA, and double-stranded DNA. M-MuLV DNA polymerase-associated RNase H acted as a random exonuclease. When [3-H]poly(A)-poly(dT) was used as a substrate, the size of the M-MuLV DNA polymerase-associated RHase H digested product was larger than the size of the digestion products by AMV DNA polymerase. The oligonucleotide digestion products could be further digested to 5'-AMP by snake venom phosphodiesterase, indicating that the products were terminated by 3'-OH groups. Alkaline hydrolysis of the oligonucleotide digestion products generated pAp, suggesting that M-MuLV DNA polymerase-associated RNase H cleaves at the 3' side of the 3',5'-phosphodiester bond. The ratios of the rates of DNA polymerase activity and RNase H activity were not significantly different in the murine and avian enzymes.",,['10.1128/JVI.15.4.843-854.1975 [doi]'],PMC354528,,,

These are pharmoacologically active peptiedes having potent permeability characteristics previously described by this laboratory. Leukokinins are formed by cathepsin D-like enzymes present in the invading cells and in the ascites fluid acting on a protein substrate, leukokininogen. present in the ascites fluid. Pestatin inhibits the action of these leukokinin-forming enzymes invitro but has no effect on kallikreins (bradykinin-forming enzymes) in vitro. Human ascites fluid from a patient with ovarian carcioma was found to have a paepstatin-inhibited, leukokinin-generating system, as does the mouse. A 'chemical mediator' theory is proposed for ascites fromation which broadens the previously held theory of lymphatic blockage (Holm-Nielsen) and may explain the recent findings of Hirabayashi and Graham of increased plasma-ascites exchange in peritoneal carcionmatosis. Pepstatin inhibition of chemical mediator formation may represent a new therapeutic approach to ascites fluid accumulation in neoplastic disease.",,,,,,

Of 246 studies performed in patients with a variety of active solid tumors, 218 (89%) were true-positive studies and 28 (11%) were false-negative. Of 69 scans in patients thought to be free of tumor after therapy, 32 (46%) were false-positive studies and 37 (54%) were true-negative. The true-positive rates by major tumor type were: adenocarcinoma of gastrointestinal tract origin (95%), lymphoma (88%), melanoma (87%), sarcomas (82%), lung (77%), breast (77%), childhood tumors (71%), gynecologic tumors (70%), and genitourinary tumors (68%). Soft tissue and lymphatic sites of tumor, both above and below the diaphragm, were easily visualized, whereas hepatic and bone marrow sites of involvement were less easily discerned. False-positive uptake with 111In-bleomycin was noted in lungs (6%), gut (3%), mediastinum (2%), normal breast tissue (0.8%), and in occasional inflammatory lesions. In 19 patients with multiple myeloma or leukemia, a pattern of diminished bone marrow uptake associated with abnormal accumulation of 111In-bleomycin in extramedullary sites of involvement was the rule. In another 23 patients in whom scans were performed because an occult tumor was suspected, scanning did not lead to specific diagnosis of tumor in a single instance. We conclude that 111In-bleomycin is a safe, effective, and useful new tumor-imaging agent in the initial staging and followup of patients with a variety of solid tumors. Significant advantages of this agent over other currently available radiopharmaceuticals include: A) a broader spectrum of tumors taking up the radio-pharmaceutical, and B) generally better delineation of abdominal and pelvic disease due to lack of interference from gut uptake.",,['10.1002/1097-0142(197504)35:4<1036::aid-cncr2820350405>3.0.co;2-2 [doi]'],,,,

Antisera prepared in rabbits against granule alkaline phosphatase purified from the neutrophils of a patient with PRV produced a single precipitin line of antigenic identity when reacted with extracts of normal, PRV, and CML neutrophil granules. A histochemical stain for alkaline phosphatase activity (alpha-naphthyl acid phosphate coupled with Fast Blue RR) specifically stained the precipitin line. A variety of quantitative precipitin techniques failed to produce satisfactory precipitation of alkaline phosphatase activity. Comparative analyses were therefore performed by affinity chromatography using goat antirabbit-gammaglobulin linked to Sepharose 4B to adsorb alkaline phosphatase complexed with rabbit gamma globulin. With this method, 100% of CML, normal, and PRV alkaline phosphatase could be adsorbed. Using limiting concentrations of antibody, a proportionally smaller fraction of enzyme activity was absorbed as the concentration of PRV alkaline phosphatase or normal alkaline phosphatase was increased. Extracts of CML granules containing comparable amounts of protein but 200-fold less alkaline phosphatase activity per milligram did not specifically reduce adsorption. Thus, in CML, we found no evidence that the granulocytes contained a large amount of antigenically normal but enzymatically defective alkaline phosphatase. Examination of electron micrographs revealed no significant differences in the number or distribution of granules in the granulocytes of normal subjects or patients with PRV or CML. This suggests that the low level of neutrophil alkaline phosphatase in CML granulocytes is the result of decreased enzyme content and not a consequence of synthesis of catalytically defective enzyme.",,['S0006-4971(20)66546-6 [pii]'],,,,

(78 bags). Eighty-nine courses of granulocyte transfusion therapy consisting of 1 or more such bags were administered to forty-one ABO-compatible patients with acute leukaemia or aplastic anaemia, who had definite or probable infections that had failed to respond to antibiotics. The fever resolved after 67% of courses of transfusions of two or more bags but after only 24% of transfusions of single bags of granulocytes (p less than 0-01), and this result suggests that this form of treatment is in general effective. Granulocytes from C.G.L. and normal donors were equally effective, although transfusion reactions were commoner after C.G.L. cells (33% versus 12%, respectively, p less than 0-05). C.G.L. grafts, and probable graft-versus-host disease, occurred in three recipients of unirradiated C.G.L. cells. Recipients of normal cells whose fevers resolved received on average four times as many granulocytes per sq.m. as those fevers did not respond. No such difference was found when C.G.L. cells were used. The fever was more likely to resolve in recipients with established or clinically probable bacterial or fungal infections than in those with fever of uncertain cause. Fever was less likely to resolve in recipients with peripheral blood granulocyte counts before transfusion of greater than 1000 per mul. It is concluded that granulocyte transfusion therapy is a valuable advance in the management of infections in neutropenic patients.",,"['S0140-6736(75)91276-3 [pii]', '10.1016/s0140-6736(75)91276-3 [doi]']",,,,

However, this phenomenon is only observed when a complement source capable of mediating the lysis of EL4 cells sensitized with such heterologous antibody is used. This complement mediated enhancement of anti-tumor antibody absorption was observed in vivo for three strains of mice. Omission of complement or the use of genetically deficient complement sources resulted in no effect on circulating antibody titer when compared to the titer of heterologous anti-tumor antibody observed in the periphery when injected alone. Exogenous complement did not enhance the clearance of heterologous anti-tetanus toxin serum, thereby suggesting that the increased absorption of anti-EL4 in vivo is not related simply to the enhanced clearance of foreign gamma-globulin. Confirmatory evidence of the role of complement in altering anti-tumor antibody specificity in vivo was obtained in a guinea pig tumor model as well. The data suggest that anti-tumor serum shown to be relatively specific for the tumor cell gains additional specificity in the presence of functional complement and consequently manifests avidity for cross-reactive determinants previously thought to be unrelated.",,,,,,

The mediators were defined in terms of their physicochemical characteristics: slow reacting substance of anaphylaxis (SRS-A) by purification through silicic acid chromatography and inactivation by arylsulfatase; eosinophil chemotactic factor of anaphylaxis (ECF-A) by its gel filtration through Sephadex G-25 and inactivation by subtilisin and not trypsin; and platelet-activating factor (PAF) by its inherent binding to albumin. Both ECF-A and histamine were present in their preformed state, and for histamine it was possible to establish that the concentration per cell was comparable to that of normal human basophils. Dibutyryl cyclic AMP suppressed release of histamine and SRS-A, indicating that their availability was under a control similar to that observed with normal cells subjected to immunologic activation. The demonstration that a suspension of leukemic human basophils contained the preformed mediators, histamine and ECF-A, and generated SRS-A and PAF for release along with histamine and ECF-A, after activation with a calcium ionophore, establishes that a single cell type can serve as a source of the four recognized mediators of immediate-type hypersensitivity.",,,,,,

Care was taken in the purification of the antigen to remove certain other DNA polymerases found in human cells. An incubation of antigen and antiserum lasting about 48 hours is necessary to achieve maximal inhibition. About 1 mug of the antipolymerase immunoglobulin G, prepared in rats, neutralizes 60% of the activity present in 54 ng of the enzyme. Tritrations varying both antiserum and enzyme demonstrate clear regions of antigen and antibody excess. Inhibition of enzyme activity is about the same whether the templateprimer is (dA)n-(dT)12-18, or partially digested DNA. An assay was developed which measures the remaining activity in the supernatant after precipitation of enzyme-antibody complexes with goat anti-rat immunoglobulin G. In this assay, 2.2 mug of the antipolymerase immunoglobulin G quantitatively bind 33 ng of DNA polymerase I. With use of the direct neutralization assay and the immuno-precipitation test, we found little, if any, antigenic relationship between DNA polymerase I and DNA polymerase II (3.4 S). Similarly, little, if any, relationship was found to the DNA polymerases from five RNA tumor viruses. The activities of RNA-directed DNA polymerases from the blood leukocytes of two patients with acute myelogenous leukemia and from the placentas of rhesus monkeys were not inhibited in neutralization assays which were shortened because these enzymes were thermolabile. In identically shortened neutralization assays, the antipolymerase immunoglobulin G neutralized up to 76% of the activity of DNA polymerase I. In addition to its utility in distinguishing cellular DNA polymerases, the rat antiserum should be useful reagent for testing of novel DNA polymerases isolated in small quantities from human tumors for contamination with DNA polymerase I. This enzyme is present in abundance in proliferating tissue and often confuses the biochemical characterization of these novel enzymes.",,['S0021-9258(19)41750-X [pii]'],,,,

The ratios of fluorescence emission at 590 and 530 nm reflect the thermal stability of chromatin in situ. The results show that the mean thermal stability of the chromatin in neoplastic cells was lower than the stability of their normal counterparts in all cases. This was found in both spontaneous and chemically induced tumors as divergent in type as a dog vaginal tumor and murine lymphocytic leukemia. These data, together with our previous observations in other neoplastic systems, indicate that reduced chromatin thermal stability may be a general characteristic of cells that have undergone neoplastic transformation and is not confined to rapidly growing tumors. The present investigation identifies the sources of variability encountered in measuring fluorescence metachromasia in slide preparations, and methods of minimizing this variability for potential cytodiagnostic application are discussed.",,,,,,

Both C58 and BALB/c cells have been shown to contain endogenous viruses that are designated N-tropic because they grow preferentially in cells of NIH Swiss mouse origin. While demonstrating many similar biological and immunological properties, the C58-induced virus is around 10-fold more infectious per physical particle than the N-tropic virus of BALB/c cells. In the present studies, inoculation of these viruses into newborn NIH Swiss mice led to the development of diseases associated with splenomegaly and lymphadenopathy at similar frequency in each group. The disease induced by C58-MuLV was histophathologically diagnosed as lymphoblastic leukemia and was highly malignant following transplantation into newborn mice. The histopathological appearance of spleens from BALB/c virus-affected animals was distinguishable, demonstrating instead myeloid metaplasia or myelogenous leukemia. These findings provide evidence that different endogenous mouse type C viruses can induce distinct diseases in the same mouse strain. Furthermore, they implicate the N-tropic virus endogenous to C58 cells as a major factor in the development of lymphoblastic leukemia that occurs at high frequency in that strain.",,,,,,

Nonstimulated (resting) platelets from leukemic patients varied greatly in size; exhibited marked variation in the number of alpha granules present per cell; had poorly delineated circumferential bands of microtubules; and often grossly dilated open channel systems or cytoplasmic vacuolization. The intracellular concentrations of ATP and ADP were significantly below normal, and the specific radioactivity of ATP and ADP of nonstimulated platelets in leukemia was equivalent to or exceeded that seen in stimulated normal platelets. Addition of ADP or collagen to platelets from leukemic patients was followed by retarded and incomplete shape change, delayed and incomplete centripetal migration of subcellular organelles, impaired degranulation, and the formation of loose aggregates composed of relatively few platelets. Stimulation of ""leukemic"" platelets with collagen led to the release of significantly subnormal amounts of ATP and ADP and no significant change in the specific radioactivity of the intracellular nucleotides. In contrast to the results in normal platelets, the conversion of ATP to inosine monophosphate and hypoxanthine in platelets in leukemia failed to increase significantly with collagen stimulation. The results indicate that abnormalities exist in the storage pool of adenine nucleotides and the release mechanism of platelets in acute leukemia. These defects appear to contribute to an impairment in the release reaction in these platelets.

To date, long-term disease-free survival has been achieved in a small proportion of carefully selected patients with resistant acute leukemia.

Major problems in marrow transplantation for leukemia include tumor resistance and a spectrum of immunologic complications including GVHD, immunodeficiency, and interstitial pneumonitis.

Its spasmogenic action on guinea pig ileal muscle was largely inactivated under reducing conditions which suggested that a peroxy group was present and important for contractile activity. This was supported by ferrous thiocyanate analysis. The peroxy group is almost certainly at the 5 position, probably in the form of a peroxy ester or hydroperoxide. Based on amino acid hydrolysis (0.85 moles of glycine and 0.30 moles of glutamic acid per mole SRS), the sulfur containing side chain is apparently a mixture of glutathione and cysteinyl-glycine, but by chromatography the side chain is predominantly glutathione and the low yield of glutamic acid may be due to complexing of its alpha COOH group in a peroxy ester linkage. The fatty acid moiety has 3 conjugated double bonds, probably at the 7,8, 9,10 and 11,12 positions. Type II SRS, the second major species, differs in that the sulfur containing side chain is linked at the 12 or 13 position and is almost certainly glutathione and in the failure of alkaline borohydride to produce inactivation. These observations strongly implicate the lipoxygenase pathway in slow reacting substance biosynthesis.",,"['0090-6980(79)90088-1 [pii]', '10.1016/0090-6980(79)90088-1 [doi]']",,,,

From the results in 45 patients with severe aplastic anemia it is concluded that the majority do not have a defect at the pluripotent stem cell itself.

In SAA it was shown that hemopoietic chimerism and apparently permanent cures can be achieved in the majority of patients by conditioning with cyclophosphamide followed by bone marrow transplantation (BMT) from an HLA-identical sibling. The previous transfusion history is crucial for failure or success: untransfused patients do very well while graft rejection is an enormous problem in most polytransfused ones. We have shown that most patients without HLA-identical sibling donors can be adequately helped as well. After conditioning with ALG followed by transfusion of haploidentical marrow and low dose androgens there is partial to complete autologous hemopoietic reconstitution in virtually all patients. This points to the fact that most of these patients have pluripotent hemopoietic stem cells that are intact, but apparently unable to differentiate to mature cells, because they are inhibited by autoimmune mechanisms. The results of BMT in patients with endstage leukemia are modest. New pilotstudies with early marrow grafts, i.e. for ANLL in first remission and for ALL in second remission indicate that with this type of approach potentially over 50% of all patients with HLA-identical siblings can be cured. We recommend that HLA-typing should be performed early in families with SAA and AL and that the possibility of a marrow graft should be seriously considered before the patients have endstage disease. Marrow grafts are technically simple but they may pose enormous problems such as graft versus host reaction (GvH), interstitial pneumonia, graft rejection and leukemic recurrence. Therefore, the procedure should only be performed in highly specialized centers with much knowledge and experience in the immunobiology of bone marrow transplantation.",,['10.1159/000214476 [doi]'],,,,

(1) Exposure of cells to low doses of X-ray prior to pulse labeling reduces the pH 11.3 fraction by 40-50% while there is little change in the other fractions. (2) Synchronization of cells by inhibiting DNA synthesis with FdU, followed by a 2 min pulse label, yields approximately 50% of the incorporated 3H-thymidine in the pH 11.3 fraction. The pH step elution technique has the following advantages: 1. Intermediates of high specific activity can be isolated from 10(6) cells per filter; 2. By lysing cells on a filter, proteins, nucleases, and other cellular materials are eliminated; 3. DNA in the lysate is never handled, thus eliminating shearing; 4. Eluted DNA may be instantaneously neutralized by collecting into a buffer to protect it from alkaline degradation.",,['10.1007/BF00292268 [doi]'],,,,

This involves conversion of 6-MP into a phenyl mercury derivative by its reaction with phenyl mercuric acetate in alkaline plasma and extracting into toluene. Back-extraction of the toluene layer with 0.1N HCl regenerates 6-MP, which is then oxidised to purine-6-sulphonate and assayed fluorimetrically. 3 This assay has been modified to measure azathioprine and a new thiopurine metabolite in plasma. 4 In a kidney transplant patient given azathioprine, 50 mg i.v., conversion to 6-MP was rapid and the plasma half-life of 6-MP was 36 min. 5 These assays are suitable for studying the pharmacokinetics of azathioprine in patients with kidney transplants.

Not only lymphoma and leukemia cell lines, but also lymphoblastoid cell lines, lacking markers of malignancy, were tumorigenic in the brains of nude mice. These findings indicate that tumorigenicity following intracranial heterotransplantation in nude mice cannot be used as proof for the malignant nature of established cell lines. Heterotraplantation of primary cell specimens yielded only a few tumor takes. When primary cells were infected with exogenous Epstein-Barr virus prior to the transplantation procedure, tumorigenicity could be significantly increased.

Several techniques are available for granulocyte collection. Some involve centrifugation of the whole blood and one removes granulocytes from whole blood by reversible adhesion to nylon fibers. The risks to the donor from leukapheresis do not appear to be greater than from whole blood donation. Granulocytes collected by centrifuge techniques function normally in vitro and have normal intravascular recovery and disappearance following transfusion. Granulocytes collected by filtration leukapheresis function almost normally in vitro but have a reduced intravascular recovery and abnormal kinetics as they leave the circulation. The role of leukocyte typing and compatibility testing for granulocyte transfusion is controversial. When the recipient has circulating antibody against donor leukocytes, transfused leukocytes do not circulate or migrate to sites of infection but are sequestered in the liver and spleen. Clinical studies have not defined whether patients benefit equally well clinically from transfusion of compatible or incompatible granulocytes. Initial reports of clinical trials of granulocyte transfusion were promising. However, similar patients who did not receive granulocytes were not studied. Most subsequent controlled trials showed a clear benefit from granulocyte transfusion while others did not. Differences in antibiotic therapy, chemotherapy, use of laminar flow rooms, and grouping of patients make it difficult to compare these clinical trials. Some, but not all, infected granulocytopenic patients benefit from transfusion. Granulocyte transfusions improve survival of granulocytopenic patients with gram negative sepsis and prolonged bone marrow aplasia. Studies are now attempting to identify other patients who should receive granulocytes, the optimum dose and schedule of transfusions, the optimum time to begin transfusion, and the value, if any, of prophylactic transfusions.",178,['10.3109/10408367909147137 [doi]'],,,,

One pair received marrow from their identical twins for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia; the other pair were grafted with allogeneic marrow from their siblings for aplastic anaemia. One of each pair showed successful engraftment while in the others the grafts failed. The colony-forming assay was then used to investigate marrow function in five grafted aplastic patients. Of these, four rejected their first grafts and required further immunosuppression before engraftment could be accomplished. The remaining patient was immunosuppressed at the outset with antithymocyte globulin (ATG) and her first graft was successful. Sera from all five patients inhibited colony formation by normal human marrow and it is suggested that this activity was related to graft rejection as well as to the pathogenesis of the condition.",,['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1979.tb03698.x [doi]'],,,,

The relatively small value of affinity constant indicates that the pharmacological properties of ara-C might not be influenced very strongly by the HSA interaction or by competitive binding of other drugs. Selective chemical modifications of HSA with diethylpyrocarbonate (DEP) or o-nitrophenylsulfenyl chloride (NPS-Cl) reduce significantly the affinity of the strong binding area. On the other hand, the attachment of poly-alpha-L-glutamyl or poly-DL-alanyl side-chains to BSA increase the number of the strong and secondary binding sites and also the affinity at the first group of sites.

The ECF is highly specific for eosinophils and does not attract polymorphonuclear neutrophils. A dose-dependent non-cytotoxic ECF release induced by AA can be obtained from human polymorphonuclear neutrophils from a lymphocyte-monocyte-basophil suspension, from rat basophil leukemia cells, but not from human lymphocytes. Kinetic studies demonstrate that ECF release occurs rapidly with an early rise and steep fall-off at later times of secretion. The amount of ECF release is dependent on pH, temperature and medium which is used for stimulation. Gel filtration analysis as well as subcellular fractionation studies suggest that the AA-induced ECF is a biological activity either distinct from AA and its split products or representing a known or unknown conversion product of AA with potent effects on eosinophils at minimal concentrations.

Since aminomalonic acid is unstable and inert in vivo as an inhibitor of L-asparagine synthetase, attempts were made to deliver it to the site of its intended action via precursors: the diamide (2-aminomalonamide), the diester (diethylaminomalonate), and the keto acid (ketomalonic acid).

In vivo, aminomalonamide failed to inhibit tumoral L-asparagine synthetase at any time period up to 24 h after its oral or intraperitoneal administration.

In all instances, enzyme activity rose rapidly between the fourth and eighth day after TMP. The time course of the rise and fall of dihydrofolate activity approaches cellular life span and is similar to that obtained after methotrexate or triamterene administration. Dihydrofolate reductases, partially purified from leukocytes of patients treated with TMP, bone marrow and leukemic leukocytes, had simila molecular weights, pH optima, Ki of inhibitor (methotrexate); they were stimulated to the same degree by KCl and urea. Electrophoresis of the enzyme on cellulose acetate strip resulted in the separation of two enzymatically active protein components. No differences in the electrophoretic behavior of the three blood cell enzymes were noted. The findings noted above are consistent with the suggestion that the observed rise in dihydrofolate reductase activity is a quantitative one. Moreover, the effect of TMP in vivo is discussed in comparison with the currently held hypothesis for methotrexate action (stabilization by the drug of a previously synthetized enzyme).",,['10.1159/000458570 [doi]'],,,,

This binding was demonstrated by gel filtration of a mixture of the microsomal fraction of the cells and 125I-labeled gp70. A rapid and convenient assay was developed to measure the complex formation between the membrane receptors and gp70 involving specific precipitation of the complex by 3 to 4% polyethylene glycol. The complex formation was responsive to the concentrations of both the receptor and gp70 and also to changes in temperature and pH. The gp70 binding was a noncooperative, saturable process, and an association constant of 3.5 X 10(8) M-1 was estimated from the binding data. The complex formation was reversible and a near-total exchange of 125I-labeled gp70 in the complex was achieved by incubation with excess of unlabeled gp70. The complex formation was inhibited by protein denaturing agents, guanidine-hydrochloride and urea. Pretreatment of the membrane fractions with either chymotrypsin or phospholipase C led to a loss of the membrane-associated receptor activity, indicating that a lipoprotein structure was important for the receptor function, consistent with the observation that nonionic detergents strongly inhibited the complex formation.",,['10.1128/JVI.28.3.686-696.1978 [doi]'],PMC525792,,,

HLA compatibility has been the cornerstone of matching for prophylactic platelet transfusion; while HLA matched platelets are often of benefit, we have observed that HLA matching does not reliably predict transfusion responses. The platelet migration inhibition assay is, however, consistently predictive. The matching problem may be circumvented by the use of frozen autologous platelets, which circulate and function hemostatically. In the granulocytopenic patient with de novo fever (frequently due to bacterial sepsis), the immediate empiric use of broad spectrum antibiotics is mandatory. If the marrow begins to recover from chemotherapy shortly after the onset of infection, such that the peripheral granulocyte count will approach normal within 10 days, the likelihood of survival from an episode of septicemia after antibiosis now approaches 80%. If the marrow does not recover shortly, however, the likelihood of survival with antibiosis alone is poor. In this setting, survival is improved if patients are given granulocyte transfusions in addition to antibiotics. Patients who receive chemotherapy in a laminar air-flow room (LAFR) experience fewer severe infections than do patients in a conventional ward. However, most patients who are unresponsive to initial chemotherapy remain so in spite of protection from infection. Thus, the available results do not suggest that the LAFR is likely to improve appreciably the rate or duration of remission. Using malignant lymphoma as a model, we have found that cryopreserved autologous marrow infusions can hasten hematopoietic recovery in man after high-dose chemotherapy, and earlier reconstitution may be of clinical benefit to the patient; techniques are at hand that might permit the application of this concept to AML.",48,['10.1002/1097-0142(197808)42:2+<883::aid-cncr2820420710>3.0.co;2-f [doi]'],,,,

The effect on spleen colony formation caused by the transplantation of untreated lymphocytes, as well as of lymphocytes previously incubated with PHA, or with PHA plus L-asparaginase, or with lymphokines, was studied. Then the effect of the urinary colony-stimulating factor in vitro, and the in vitro feeder-layer activity of leucocytes on colony formation of human and mice bone marrow cells in haematological diseases is dealth with. The injection of rat lymphocytes previously incubated for 24 hours with PHA resulted in a higher number and a larger size of colonies in the spleen of the recipient rats. Lymphocytes preincubated with lymphokines gave rise to the formation of spleen colonies which were larger than those developing after the injection of untreated lymphocytes. When the lymphocytes were previously incubated with PHA plus L-asparaginase, PHA failed to stimulate colony formation in the spleen. The phenomenon is explained by assuming that PHA, as an aspecific stimulator of cell division, initiated the division of CFUs, thus the CFUs content of the preincubated samples increased, resulting in an increase in the number of colonies formed after the transplantation of lymphocytes pretreated with PHA. Another possible explanation is that CFUs division, or their spleen take is enhanced by the immunocompetent lymphocytes activated by PHA, either directly or via soluble mediators produced or released by immunocompetent lymphocytes such as lymphokines. The study of colony-forming cells and colony-stimulating activity in primary myelofibrosis (PM) showed an increase in the number of circulating CFUc in this condition, and an abnormal density of these cells reaching a peak below 1.062. The lowering of CSA in the first two peripheral blood gradient fractions agrees with the observation in the same fractions of a high percentage of CFUc at the expense of the CSC population. Thus, double cell population seems to exist in PM. One is greatly abnormal with a low specific density and high plating efficiency, whereas the other population is almost normal, showing a higher specific density and a lower plating efficiency.",,,,,,

Infectivity was monitored by focus formation for Ha-SV and XC plaque formation for Mo-MuLV. The viral DNA titration pattern followed single-hit kinetics for both foci and plaques, indicating that a single molecule carried information for each function. Focus-forming and plaque-forming activity were present in different molecules, since these two biological activities could be separated from each other by agarose gel electrophoresis. The focus-forming molecule was linear DNA with a molecular weight of about 4 x 10(6) daltons.

A direct immunfluorescent staining technique was used. Dermo-epidermal IgM deposits were found in 11% of healthy individuals and patients before grafting but were present in 86% of patients with chronic and 39% of patients with acute GVHD. Patients with allogeneic grafts who never had GVHD or who had recovered from it and patients with syngeneic grafts showed findings not different from those in healthy individuals. Findings similar to those with IgM, although less striking, were made for C3, i.e., patients who had chronic or acute GVHD had a high incidence and intensity of C3 deposits at the dermo-epidermal junction.

Immunocompetent cells from LPS treated DBA/2 donors were effective when used for adoptive immunotherapy (in combination with chemoradiotherapy) of BW5147 leukemia. GVH associated mortality decreased as the dose of spleen cells from LPS treated histoincompatible donors was increased as much as four times the number necessary to eliminate leukemia.

(N, 12), 2.28 +/- 0.82 (N, 8), and 0.60 +/- 0.13 (N, 9), respectively. The mean value for the ratio in the pretreated leukemia was significantly higher than that in the other 2 groups (p less than 0.01). By separating these acid and alkaline RNases from normal and leukemic sera by phosphocellulose chromatography, it was further confirmed that acid RNase alone increased markedly in leukemic serum. From serum and leukocytes of leukemic patients, acid RNases were purified about 2000-fold and 300-fold, respectively, by phosphocellulose and Sephadex G-75 chromatography. Both enzymes displayed properties nearly identical with those of normal serum and leukocytes, except that leukemic serum acid RNase had about a 2.4-fold greater affinity for polyuridylate than for polycytidylate as substrate, in contrast to normal serum acid RNase that degraded polycytidylate exclusively. On the other hand acid RNases from serum leukocytes of leukemia showed a similar substrate preference. These results suggest that the high RNase levels of leukemic sera are due to an excessive leakage of acid RNase into the blood stream from abnormal leukocytes.",,,,,,

Both the normal and leukemic cells have beta(2)-adrenergic receptors, and the [(3)H]dihydroalprenolol binding was saturable, reversible, and stereospecific. The leukemic cells consisted of clones that could be induced to differentiate (MGI(+)D(+)) and clones that could not be induced to differentiate to mature macrophages and granulocytes by the protein inducer MGI. The different types of leukemic clones all had 1100-2300 receptor sites per cell, whereas normal macrophages had 7000 receptors per cell. The differentiation of MGI(+)D(+) leukemic cells was associated with an increase in receptors to a number similar to that found with normal macrophages. MGI(+)D(+) leukemic cells and normal macrophages were able to densensitize to the beta-adrenergic agonist (-)isoproterenol, shown by termination of cyclic AMP induction within 10-15 min and the lack of a second induction. The leukemic cells that could not be induced to differentiate lacked this capacity for desensitization, possibly due to an alteration in the uncoupling system between the receptor and adenylate cyclase. The lack of desensitization in these leukemic cells was associated with a higher sensitivity to the receptor-mediated cytotoxic effects of adrenergic hormones. It is suggested that cells, like some leukemic cells, that are unable to desensitize to adrenergic and possibly other hormones may be appropriate targets for differential destruction by hormones under conditions that do not affect normally desensitizing cells.",,['10.1073/pnas.75.4.1805 [doi]'],PMC392429,,,

Refinements in the purification technique and its monitoring are required, however. For the same category of patients it seems worthwhile to continue attempts at restoration with liver cells from fetuses less than 12 weeks of age. In addition, full protection against infections should be provided for patients expected to develop GVHD, and, therefore, such patients should only be treated in centers where reverse isolation and bacteriologic decontamination can be performed. In view of the rarity of the disease, transplanters should agree on a limited number of graft protocols. For the treatment of bone marrow aplasia, attempts to identify the factors that can serve to predict the occurrence of GVHD in compatible host-donor sibling pairs should be continued. Only when the patients who will develop GVHD can be recognized in advance will it be feasible to fully exploit available GVHD reductive measures. In particular the role of the intestinal microflora should be investigated in this respect. Experimental evidence is presented, suggesting an aggravating influence of microflora on GVHD lesions, which are primarily induced by histocompatibility reactions. For such studies with incompatible siblings, the dog is the best available animal model. For the selective isolation of hemopoietic stem cells for transplantation purposes (as one means of reducing GVHD), methods for rapid identification of stem cells and immune competent cells, respectively, have to be developed. In leukemia, more research is necessary on the factors that play a role in the late complications of bone marrow transplantation. The toxicity of aggressive regimens employed in the eradication of the leukemia should be further analyzed. The collection of autologous normal hemopoietic stem cells from leukemic patients as introduced by Dicke et al. warrants further exploration to see whether these cells may replace the allogeneic transplantation procedure, thus avoiding all the complications generally encountered in GVHD. For all three diseases, it is extremely important to develop a method for the selection of compatible donors among unrelated individuals, because this will at least double the number of candidates for therapeutic bone marrow transplantation. Current progress in histocompatibility typing in the rhesus monkey and the dog makes these species excellent models for such investigations.",25,,,,,

Peripheral blood lymphocytes from patients and normals (marrow donors and healthy unrelated individuals) were tested for cell inhibition (CI) of cultured skin fibroblasts from both patients and donors by using the microcytotoxicity assay. In addition, blocking of CI by factors in patient serum was studied. Three groups of patients were studied. Patients in group I were stable long-term survivors without evidence of graft-vs-host diseases (GVHD) between 250 to 1547 days postgrafting. Patients in group II were short-term survivors with or without acute GVHD between 36 and 144 days postgrafting. Patients in group III had chronic GVHD either at the time of testing or developed chronic GVHD subsequent to CI testing between days 61 and 960 postgrafting. Eleven of 14 patients in group I showed absence of both CI and serum blocking and three showed CI and blocking. Patients in group II without acute GVHD showed absence of CI and serum blocking on three occasions, presence of CI and blocking on four occasions, and CI without blocking on three occasions. Patients in group II with acute GVHD showed absence of CI on one occasion and presence of CI and blocking on three occasions. Patients in group III showed absence of CI and blocking on seven occasions and CI without blocking on two occasions. These results suggest that the maintenance of stable graft-host tolerance in long-term survivors after marrow grafting from HLA identical donors does not depend on the presence of serum-blocking factors. Short-term survivors with and without GVHD showed a spectrum of in vitro reactivity with 50% of the patients showing serum-blocking factors, and these results did not appear to be correlated with presence or absence of acute GVHD. Finally, results of the microcytotoxicity assays failed to provide insight into the mechanism of chronic GVHD.",,,,,,

Initial therapy consisting of aspiration and irrigation, and intermittent pneumatic cuff compression should be undertaken for a trial period of 12 to 36 hours, repeating the aspiration 2 or 3 times if necessary.

This shows that EBV transformation per se does not necessarily render lymphocytes tumorigenic in nude mice. The capacity to form colonies in agarose is not acquired either. (2) Changes of the karyotype and several phenotypic characteristics which occur in the originally diploid LCL during prolonged cultivation in vitro may be accompanied by the acquisition of the potential to grow subcutaneously in nude mice and in agarose in vitro.

Effects of NFTA on antibody-mediated immunity and cell-mediated immunity of BALB/c mice were studied using the spleen plaque assay for detection of immunoglobulin M-producing cells and the graft-versus-host (GVH) reaction, respectively. NFTA suppressed both responses. With the spleen plaque assay, the number of antibody-forming cells (AFC) to sheep red blood cells was significantly less than in unmedicated, control mice after treated mice received NFTA at 1000 ppm for 6 days. The GVH reaction was not suppressed at 21 days, but was severely suppressed at 70 days, prior to the histological appearance of leukemia. Effect of dose was studied by administering NFTA at 100, 250, 500, and 1000 ppm of diet for 13 to 14 weeks and then determining the response in the spleen plaque assay and GVH reactions. The ratio of AFC/spleen of NFTA-treated groups to AFC/spleen of an unmedicated control group, at the above specified doses, was 0.86, 0.22, 0.33, and 0.54 in ascending dosage order beginning with 100 ppm. For the GVH reaction, the suppression of the cell-mediated immunity was directly proportional to the dose of NFTA. Suppression of the antibody-mediated immunity in relation to the induction of leukemia at 28 weeks was studied by feeding NFTA at 500 ppm for 14 weeks, followed by unmedicated diet for 14 weeks. During the 11th week, mice were immunized with SRBC; 5 days later the spleens were removed and the spleen plaque assay was performed. Eight of 18 mice fed NFTA developed leukemia.

Evidence is presented that this reaction is not attributable to a methyltransferase but to the following reaction sequence: (a) an oxidation of N5-[14C]methyltetrahydrofolate to N5, N10-[14C]methylenetetrahydrofolate that is catalyzed by N5, N10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (EC 1.1.1.68); (b) spontaneous release of [14C]formaldehyde from N5, N10-[14C]methylenetetrahydrofolate; and (c) nonenzymatic condensation of [14C]formaldehyde with tryptamine to form a radioactive carboline derivative. The occurrence of this sequence in leukocytes is suggested by data that show that the enzyme reaction is strongly stimulated by addition of flavin adenine dinucleotide and that the final product is chromatographically identical to the adduct formed in the reaction of [14C]formaldehyde with tryptamine. In the absence of tryptamine, a product accumulates that can react with other HCHO acceptors, i.e., beta-phenylethylamine and dimedone; another reaction product is tetrahydrofolate. Production of formaldehyde is relatively more active in normal lymphocytes than in normal granulocytes, but it is even higher in lymphocytes of chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Activity in granulocytes from a subject with chronic myelocytic leukemia is also elevated but to a lesser extent than activity in lymphocytes of chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Activity in granulocytes from a subject with chronic myelocytic leukemia is also elevated but to a lesser extent than activity in lymphocytes of chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Formaldehyde production in leukocytes is only slightly stimulated by addition of various cobalamins, and activity is normal in leukocytes from a vitamin B12-deficient patient. We conclude that the system is cobalamin independent. Thus, there exists an active pathway from N5-methyltetrahydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate other than the one catalyzed by cobalamin-dependent N5-methyltetrahydrofolate-homocysteine methyltransferase.",,,,,,

The relapse rate appeared to be relatively constant over the first 2 yr and was extremely low after that time.

Patients in fair clinical condition at the time of transplantation showed significantly longer survival times than patients in poor condition (p = 0.001).

This rise was demonstrable over a wide range of substrate concentrations. Both normal and leukemic lymphocytes contained a heat-stable, calcium-dependent activator of phosphodiesterase. However, the increased activity of phosphodiesterase in leukemic lymphocytes was not due to this protein activator since (a) phosphodiesterase activity from these cells was not stimulated by this activator and (b) phosphodiesterase activity of leukemic lymphocytes was not inhibited by the calcium chelater, ethylene-glycol-bis,(beta-aminoethylether)-N,N'-tetraacetic acid, suggesting that the enzyme was not already maximally activated. A comparison of several other properties of phosphodiesterase from normal and leukemic lymphocytes showed that the enzymes have similar pH optima, similar stabilities to freezing and thawing and similar sensitivities to inhibition by the phosphodiesterase inhibitors, chlorpromazine, papaverine and isobutylmethylxanthine. However, the subcellular distribution of the phosphodiesterases was different, and the phosphodiesterase of leukemic lymphocytes was significantly more resistant to heat than that of normal lymphocytes. Although no differences were found between the phosphodiesterases of normal and leukemic lymphocytes in their sensitivities to drugs, there were marked differences in drug sensitivity between the phosphodiesterase of lymphocytes and that of other tissue. For example, concentrations of chlorpromazine which inhibited phosphodiesterase of cerebrum by 70% had no effect on phosphodiesterase activity of lymphocytes. On the othere hand, the papaverine-induced inhibition of phosphodiesterase was similar in lymphocytes and cerebrum. Since an optimal concentration of cyclic nucleotides is essential to maintain normal cell growth, these results suggest that the abnormal growth characteristics of leukemic lymphocytes may be explained by their high activity of phosphodiesterase.

Among these are the oligosaccharides GlcNAc-beta(1 leads to 4)-MurNAc-beta(1 leads to 4)-GlcNAc-beta(1 leads to 4)-GlcNAc, GlcNAc-beta(1 leads to 4)-MurNAc-beta(1 leads to 4)-GlcNAc-beta(1 leads to 4)-N-acetyl-D-xylosamine, and GlcNAc-beta(1 leads to 4-GlcNAc-beta(1 leads to 4)-MurNAc, prepared here for the first time. The binding constants for saccharides which must have N-acetylmuramic acid, N-acetyl-D-glucosamine, or N-acetyl-D-xylosamine bound in subsite D indicate that there is no strain involved in the binding of N-acetyl-D-glycosamine in this site, and that the lactyl group of N-acetylmuramic acid (rather than the hydroxymethyl group) is responsible for the apparent strain previously reported for binding at this subsite. For hen egg-white lysozyme, the dependence of saccharide binding on pH or on a saturating concentration of Gd(III) suggests that the conformation of several of the complexes are different from one another and from that proposed for a productive complex. This is supported by fluorescence difference spectra of the various hen egg-white lysozyme-saccharide complexes. Human lysozyme binds most saccharides studied more weakly than the hen egg-white enzyme, but binds GlcNAc-beta(1 leads to 4)-MurNAc-beta(1leads to 4)-GlcNAc-beta(1 leads to 4)-MurNAc more strongly. It is suggested that subsite C of the human enzyme is ""looser"" than the equivalent site in the hen egg enzyme, so that the rearrangement of a saccharide in this subsite in response to introduction of an N-acetylmuramic acid residue into subsite D destabilizes the saccharide complexes of human lysozyme less than it does the corresponding hen egg-white lysozyme complexes. This difference and the differences in the fluorescence difference spectra of hen egg-white lysozyme and human lysozyme are ascribed mainly to the replacement of Trp-62 in hen egg-white lysozyme by Tyr-63 in the human enzyme. The implications of our findings for the assumption of superposition and additivity of energies of binding in individual subsites, and for the estimation of the role of strain in lysozyme catalysis, are discussed.",,['10.1021/bi00622a013 [doi]'],,,,

Both oncogenic preparations contained infectious B-tropic murine leukemia virus (MuLV) and particles with the ultrastructural characteristics of MuLV. No other kind of virus particle was seen. When these preparations were injected into infant syngeneic mice, B-tropic MuLV could be detected in the reticular tissues as early as 2 weeks thereafter. The virus persisted in the reticular tissues and was present in the lymphoreticular tumors that subsequently developed. However, if the same preparation was injected into young adult recipients, there may have been transient MuLV replication, but the virus subsequently disappeared from the reticular tissues and no lymphoreticular tumors developed. Previous experiments showed that MuLV was present in CFEs prepared from CAF, animals with the GVHR but absent in those of normal control mice. Since the lymphoreticular tumors arising in mice with the GVHR were the same as those induced by the CA and CB MuLV preparations, it was concluded that tumorigenesis in mice with the GVHR was caused by endogenous B-tropic MuLV activated by the immunologic disturbance.",,['10.1093/jnci/58.1.67 [doi]'],,,,

MLC studies between donors and recipients showed varying degrees of stimulation. Definite engraftment occurred in one patient and transient engraftment in another. Engraftment in the third patient could not be evaluated. In the patient with sustained engraftment, there was clinical evidence of severe graft versus host disease (GVHD) however, this was not substantiated by histologic findings.

At the same time, normal serum was shown to be without effect either against the CFU-S or against the virus. Spleen CFU-S were obtained from control and leukemic mice over a sequence of days following Rauscher virus injection and assayed by transplantation technique. Prior to transplantation these were incubated in vitro in either normal syngeneic serum or syngeneic antiserum. Incubation with antiserum had no effect on CFU-S obtained from the spleens of normal mice. However, incubation in this antiserum of spleen CFU-S from Rauscher leukemic mice resulted in a reduction of up to 50% in their colony-forming ability. Additional tests with guinea pig complement suggested that the levels of inactivation seen are not complement limited. This antiserum-induced reduction in colony formation was first evident in the second week after the injection of virus, coincident with the onset of splenomegaly in the leukemic mice.

Investigations included examination of liver biopsy, bone marrow cytology, lymphocyte response to phytohaemagglutinin (PHA), serum immunoglobulins and complement, and the presence of immunoglobulin and complement fixed in Kupffer cells. Thirty patients had TSS, five chronic lymphatic leukaemia (CLL), four a syndrome of gross lymphoid hyperplasia (GLH) distinct from TSS, CLL and the lymphomas, and twenty three miscellaneous conventional diseases. In thirteen cases no definite diagnosis could be established. TSS was found to be predominantly a disease of female Fulani cattle herders. Its essential characteristics were splenomegaly in the presence of acquired immunity to malaria, a grossly raised serum IgM, a lowered serum complement, and the presence of IgM fixed in Kupffer cells. There was lymphoid hyperplasia in bone marrow, hepatic sinusoids and often blood which may be indistinguishable from that in CLL. Lymphocytes undergo normal blastogenesis to PHA. There was clinical and haematological response to proguanil therapy. Reticuloendothelial phagocytosis of IgM, probably as a complex, seems to be the essential feature of the condition. As it was impossible to identify early cases of TSS it is unclear whether IgM overproduction or phagocytosis of IgM complexes is the first stage of the disease. The precise nature of the association with malaria remains obscure. The diagnosis of CLL demanded the demonstration of an abnormally low immunoglobulin level and impaired lymphocyte responsiveness to PHA by blast transformation or 3H-thymidine incorporation, in addition to the usual haematological findings. The syndrome GLH occurred in multiparous Hausa women. It was characterised by intense lymphocytosis with active, PHA-responsive cells, and normal immunoglobulin levels. Patients responded to proguanil therapy. It is suggested that these patients have a depressed immune response to malaria, perhaps through repeated pregnancies, and to a leukaemogenic agent, both of which stimulate lymphocytosis. Antimalarial treatment at this stage may prevent the development of frank leukaemia or lymphoma. The usefulness of the various investigative procedures and the problem of managing the large number of undiagnosed cases are discussed.",,,,,,

The largest amounts, 40-50%, of total methyltransferase and synthetase activities were localized in either the microsomal or the postribosomal fractions, depending on cell type. In addition, the highest specific activities of these two enzyme systems were found to be present in the microsomal and postribosomal fractions. The psotribosomal fraction from leukemic leukocytes had a methyltransferase specific activity higher than that of the microsomal fraction, while the same two fractions of normal leukocytes had approximately equal activities. Specific activities of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases were found to be approximately equal for these two fractions, whether they were from normal or leukemic leukocytes. The activity of tRNA methyltransferases and synthetases within the postribosomal fraction of the cytoplasm suggests the existence of high-molecular-weight enzyme complexes for the modification as well as the aminoacylation of tRNA.",,['10.1073/pnas.73.11.3857 [doi]'],PMC431241,,,

The physical basis of the elution process was studied. The kinetics of elution above the alkaline transition pH were found to occur in two phases: an initial phase in which single-strand length is rate limiting, followed by a phase in which elution is accelerated due to the accumulation of alkali-induced strand breaks. The range of DNA single-strand lengths that can be discriminated by elution above the alkaline transition pH was estimated by calibration relative to the effects of x ray, and was found to be 5 X 10(8)-10(10) daltons. Shorter DNA strands elute within the pH transition zone, which extended from pH 11.3 to 11.7 when tetrapropylammonium hydroxide was used as base. This elution was relatively rapid, but was sharply limited by pH, according to the length of the strands: the length of the strands eluted increased with increasing pH. Alkaline elution was inhibited by treatment of cells with low concentrations of nitrogen mustard, a bifunctional alkylating known to cross-link DNA.

Binding is prevented by specific antiserum raides to gp71 (anti-gp71). The binding assay as described in this report can detect receptors on as few as 300 murine cells, and with 1 X 10(5) cells gives significant binding with 30 sec. The results show that the purified glycoprotein retians biologic activity and can form a stable complex with specific receptors on mouse cell membranes. The assay can therefore be used to characterize the nature of the cellular receptors that are essential for leukemia virus infection. Purified gp71 binding to mouse cells is prevented if the cells are actively producing related ecotropic type C viruses, presumably because the receptors are occupied and are not available to bind exogenously applied gp71. The binding of gp71 to murine cells is enhanced by the presence of calcium ions and low pH.

Guanylate cyclase activity is found almost exclusively in the particulate fraction of normal rat kidney (NRK) and BALB 3T3 cells. Enzyme activity is stimulated 3- to 10-fold by treatment with the detergent Lubrol PX. However, enhancement of guanylate cyclase by fibroblast growth factor could not be demonstrated under a variety of assay conditions. In both NRK and BALB 3T3 cells guanylate cyclase activity is low during logarithmic growth and increases as the cells crowd together and growth slows. Guanylate cyclase activity is undetectable in homogenates of NRK cells transformed by the Kirsten sarcoma virus (KNRK cells) either in the presence or absence of Lubrol PX. Guanylate cyclase activity is also greatly decreased in NRK cells transformed by Moloney, Schmidt-Ruppin, or Harvey viruses. BALB 3T3 cells transformed by RNA viruses (Kirsten, Harvey, or Moloney), by a DNA virus (SV40), by methylcholanthrene, or spontaneously, all have diminished but readily detectable guanylate cyclase activity. Cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase activity is found predominately in the soluble fraction of NRK cells. This activity increases slightly as NRK cells enter the stationary growth phase. Cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase activity is undetectable in two clones of KNRK cells under a variety of assay conditions, and is decreased relative to the level present in NRK cells in a third KNRK clone. However, both Moloney- and Schmidt-Ruppin-transformed NRK cells have a phosphodiesterase activity similar to that found in NRK cells. Boiled supernatant from both NRK and KNRK cells is observed to appreciably enhance the activity of activator-deficient phosphodiesterase from bovine heart. This result indicates that the absence of cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase activity in KNRK cells is not due to a loss of the phosphodiesterase activator. The intracellular concentration of cyclic GMP is found to be very low in transformed NRK cells when compared to levels measured in confluent NRK cells. The low levels of cyclic GMP in transformed NRK cells reflect the greatly decreased guanylate cyclase activity observed in these cells. These results do not appear to support the suggestion that cyclic GMP promotes the growth of fibroblastic cells.",,['S0021-9258(17)33593-7 [pii]'],,,,

Nonetheless, marrow transplantation is sufficiently established therapeutically to be considered the treatment of choice for patients with severe aplastic anemia, and a realistic alternative for patients with recurrent acute leukemia. We suggest that patients be managed with regard to marrow transplantation according to the general approach outlined in Table 3.

Leukemic AKR mice thus treated had significant prolongation of their median survival time and a higher 60-day survival rate post treatment than did untreated controls, chemoradiotherapy controls, or control mice that received chemoradiotherapy plus cells from syngeneic donors.
