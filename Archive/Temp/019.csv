However, the underlying mechanism of its action remains unknown. METHODS: We generated bortezomib (BTZ)-resistant cell lines, treated them with various concentrations of DCZ3301 over varying periods, and studied its effect on colony formation, cell proliferation, apoptosis, cell cycle, DNA synthesis, and DNA damage response. We validated our results using in vitro and in vivo experimental models. RESULTS: DCZ3301 overcame bortezomib (BTZ) resistance through regulation of the G2/M checkpoint in multiple myeloma (MM) in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, treatment of BTZ-resistant cells with DCZ3301 restored their drug sensitivity. DCZ3301 induced M phase cell cycle arrest in MM mainly via inhibiting DNA repair and enhancing DNA damage. Moreover, DCZ3301 promoted the phosphorylation of ATM, ATR, and their downstream proteins, and these responses were blocked by the ATM specific inhibitor KU55933. CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides a proof-of-concept that warrants the clinical evaluation of DCZ3301 as a novel anti-tumor compound against BTZ resistance in MM.","['Hu, Liangning', 'Li, Bo', 'Chen,

Zinc finger and BTB/POZ domain-containing family proteins (ZBTBs) are important transcription factors functioning as oncogenes or tumor suppressors. The role and regulation of ZBTB16 in breast cancer remain to be established. METHODS: Reverse-transcription PCR and methylation-specific PCR were applied to detect expression and methylation of ZBTB16 in breast cancer cell lines and tissues. The effects of ZBTB16 in breast cancer cells were examined via cell viability, CCK8, Transwell, colony formation, and flow cytometric assays. Xenografts and immunohistochemistry analyses were conducted to determine the effects of ZBTB16 on tumorigenesis in vivo. The specific mechanisms of ZBTB16 were further investigated using Western blot, qRT-PCR, luciferase assay, and co-IP. RESULTS: ZBTB16 was frequently downregulated in breast cancer cell lines in correlation with its promoter CpG methylation status. Restoration of ZBTB16 expression led to induction of G2/M phase arrest and apoptosis, inhibition of migration and invasion, reversal of EMT, and suppression of cell proliferation, both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, ectopically expressed ZBTB16 formed heterodimers with ZBTB28 or BCL6/ZBTB27 and exerted tumor suppressor effects through upregulation of ZBTB28 and antagonistic activity on BCL6. CONCLUSIONS: Low expression of ZBTB16 is associated with its promoter hypermethylation and restoration of ZBTB16 inhibits tumorigenesis. ZBTB16 functions as a tumor suppressor through upregulating ZBTB28 and antagonizing BCL6. Our findings also support the possibility of ZBTB16 being a prognostic biomarker for breast cancer.","['He, Jin', 'Wu, Mingjun', 'Xiong, Lei', 'Gong, Yijia', 'Yu, Renjie', 'Peng, Weiyan', 'Li, Lili', 'Li, Li', 'Tian, Shaorong', 'Wang, Yan', 'Tao, Qian', 'Xiang, Tingxiu']","['He J', 'Wu M', 'Xiong L', 'Gong Y', 'Yu R', 'Peng W', 'Li L', 'Li L', 'Tian S', 'Wang Y', 'Tao Q', 'Xiang T']","['Department of Oncology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Molecular Oncology and Epigenetics, The First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'Institute of Life Science, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'Cancer Epigenetics Laboratory, Department of Clinical Oncology, State Key Laboratory of Translational Oncology, Sir YK Pao Center for Cancer and Li Ka Shing Institute of Health Sciences, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, Hong Kong.', 'Key Laboratory of Molecular Oncology and Epigenetics, The First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Molecular Oncology and Epigenetics, The First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Molecular Oncology and Epigenetics, The First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'Cancer Epigenetics Laboratory, Department of Clinical Oncology, State Key Laboratory of Translational Oncology, Sir YK Pao Center for Cancer and Li Ka Shing Institute of Health Sciences, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, Hong Kong.', 'Key Laboratory of Molecular Oncology and Epigenetics, The First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Molecular Oncology and Epigenetics, The First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Molecular Oncology and Epigenetics, The First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Molecular Oncology and Epigenetics, The First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China. qtao@cuhk.edu.hk.', 'Cancer Epigenetics Laboratory, Department of Clinical Oncology, State Key Laboratory of Translational Oncology, Sir YK Pao Center for Cancer and Li Ka Shing Institute of Health Sciences, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, Hong Kong. qtao@cuhk.edu.hk.', 'Key Laboratory of Molecular Oncology and Epigenetics, The First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China. xiangtx@cqmu.edu.cn.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200609,Germany,Clin Epigenetics,Clinical epigenetics,101516977,"['0 (BCL6 protein, human)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-6)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '147855-37-6 (ZBTB16 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'BTB-POZ Domain/*genetics', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics', 'Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis/*genetics/mortality', 'Carcinogenesis/genetics', 'CpG Islands/genetics', 'DNA Methylation/*genetics', 'Female', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Heterografts', 'Humans', 'Lymphatic Metastasis/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging/methods', 'Prognosis', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-6/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Zinc Fingers/genetics']",PMC7285556,['NOTNLM'],"['*BCL6', '*Breast cancer', '*Methylation', '*ZBTB16', '*ZBTB28']",2020/06/11 06:00,2021/08/19 06:00,['2020/06/11 06:00'],"['2020/01/31 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/06/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/19 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13148-020-00867-9 [doi]', '10.1186/s13148-020-00867-9 [pii]']",epublish,Clin Epigenetics. 2020 Jun 9;12(1):82. doi: 10.1186/s13148-020-00867-9.,['ORCID: 0000-0003-4589-0599'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has been reported as a negative regulator in leukemia and a positive regulator in colon cancer, respectively. However, its biological role in glioma remains totally unclear. METHODS: We performed quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR), immunohistochemistry (IHC) and western blot assays to evaluate ACYP2 expression. The functions of ACYP2 in glioma cells were determined by a series of in vitro and in vivo experiments, including cell proliferation, colony formation, cell cycle, apoptosis, migration, invasion and nude mouse tumorigenicity assays. In addition, western blot and co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assays were used to identify its downstream targets. RESULTS: Knocking down ACYP2 in glioma cells significantly inhibited cell proliferation, colony formation, migration, invasion and tumorigenic potential in nude mice, and induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Conversely, ectopic expression of ACYP2 in glioma cells dramatically promoted malignant phenotypes of glioma cells. Mechanistically, ACYP2 promoted malignant progression of glioma cells through regulating intracellular Ca(2+) homeostasis via its interaction with PMCA4, thereby activating c-Myc and PTP1B/STAT3 signals. This could be effectively reversed by Ca(2+) chelator BAPTA-AM or calpain inhibitor calpeptin. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate that ACYP2 functions as an oncogene in glioma through activating c-Myc and STAT3 signals via the regulation of intracellular Ca(2+) homeostasis, and indicate that ACYP2 may be a potential therapeutic target and prognostic biomarker in gliomas.","['Li, Mengdan', 'Ruan, Banjun', 'Wei, Jing', 'Yang, Qi', 'Chen, Mingwei', 'Ji, Meiju', 'Hou, Peng']","['Li M', 'Ruan B', 'Wei J', 'Yang Q', 'Chen M', 'Ji M', 'Hou P']","[""Key Laboratory for tumor Precision Medicine of Shaanxi Province and Department of Endocrinology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, 710061, P.R.

Consequently, appropriate treatment could be delayed in GNB bacteremia cases involving organisms which are not susceptible to carbapenem (carba-NS), resulting in a poor clinical outcomes. Here, we explored risk factors for carba-NS GNB bacteremia and its clinical outcomes in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) that underwent chemotherapy. METHODS: We reviewed all GNB bacteremia cases that occurred during induction or consolidation chemotherapy, over a 15-year period, in a tertiary-care hospital. RESULTS: Among 489 GNB bacteremia cases from 324 patients, 45 (9.2%) were carba-NS and 444 (90.8%) were carbapenem susceptible GNB. Independent risk factors for carba-NS GNB bacteremia were: carbapenem use at bacteremia onset (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 91.2; 95% confidence interval [95%CI]: 29.3-284.1; P < 0.001); isolation of carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (aOR: 19.4, 95%CI: 3.4-112.5; P = 0.001) in the prior year; and days from chemotherapy to GNB bacteremia (aOR: 1.1 per day, 95%CI: 1.1-1.2; P < 0.001). Carba-NS bacteremia was independently associated with in-hospital mortality (aOR: 6.6, 95%CI: 3.0-14.8; P < 0.001). CONSLUSION: Carba-NS organisms should be considered for antibiotic selection in AML patients having these risk factors.","['Shin, Dong Hoon', 'Shin, Dong-Yeop', 'Kang, Chang Kyung', 'Park, Suhyeon',

Adverse reactions to nelarabine include neurological toxicity, the pathophysiological mechanisms of which are unknown, although the administration of intrathecal therapy at therapeutic doses given concomitantly with high-dose systemic chemotherapy that crosses the blood-brain barrier may potentiate neurotoxicity. CASE REPORT: We report a case of a 29-year-old woman with a diagnosis of relapsed T-ALL who developed severe myelopathy and polyneuropathy of toxic origin that led to paraplegia, upper-limb paresis, and dysautonomia after the first cycle of nelarabine. MANAGEMENT AND OUTCOME: Rehabilitation and pharmacological treatments were initiated early, but no evidence of a significant clinical change was obtained. DISCUSSION: Neurotoxicity is a dose-dependent side effect of nelarabine. It is therefore important to consider previously administered neurotoxic drugs before using nelarabine and to monitor patients closely so as to be able to act promptly in case of toxicity. In accordance with the data obtained and based on the Naranjo algorithm, the adverse reaction could be considered possible.","['Amer-Salas, Neus', 'Gonzalez-Morcillo, Gonzalo', 'Rodriguez-Camacho, Juan Manuel', 'Cladera-Serra, Antonia']","['Amer-Salas N', 'Gonzalez-Morcillo G', 'Rodriguez-Camacho JM', 'Cladera-Serra A']","['Department of Haematology, Son Llatzer Hospital, Palma de Mallorca, Spain.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Son Llatzer Hospital, Palma de Mallorca, Spain.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Son Llatzer Hospital, Palma de Mallorca, Spain.', 'Department of Haematology, Son Llatzer Hospital, Palma de Mallorca, Spain.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20200609,England,J Oncol Pharm Pract,Journal of oncology pharmacy practice : official publication of the International Society of Oncology Pharmacy Practitioners,9511372,"['0 (Arabinonucleosides)', '60158CV180 (nelarabine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Arabinonucleosides/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Neurotoxicity Syndromes/etiology', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Spinal Cord Diseases/*chemically induced']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Nelarabine', 'Neurotoxicity', 'T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia']",2020/06/11 06:00,2021/01/27 06:00,['2020/06/11 06:00'],"['2020/06/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/27 06:00 [medline]', '2020/06/11 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/1078155220929747 [doi]'],ppublish,J Oncol Pharm Pract. 2021 Jan;27(1):244-249. doi: 10.1177/1078155220929747.

Therapies such as mRNA and siRNA encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) represent a clinically advanced platform and are utilized for a wide variety of applications. Unfortunately, transfection of RNA into CLL cells remains a formidable challenge and a bottleneck for developing targeted therapies for this disease. Therefore, we aimed to elucidate the barriers to efficient transfection of RNA-encapsulated LNPs into primary CLL cells to advance therapies in the future. To this end, we transfected primary CLL patient samples with mRNA and siRNA payloads encapsulated in an FDA-approved LNP formulation and characterized the transfection. Additionally, we tested the potential of repurposing caffeic acid, curcumin and resveratrol to enhance the transfection of nucleic acids into CLL cells. The results demonstrate that the rapid uptake of LNPs is required for successful transfection. Furthermore, we demonstrate that resveratrol enhances the delivery of both mRNA and siRNA encapsulated in LNPs into primary CLL patient samples, overcoming inter-patient heterogeneity. This study points out the important challenges to consider for efficient RNA therapeutics for CLL patients and advocates the use of resveratrol in combination with RNA lipid nanoparticles to enhance delivery into CLL cells.","['Kon, Edo', 'Hazan-Halevy, Inbal', 'Rosenblum, Daniel', 'Cohen, Niv', 'Chatterjee, Sushmita', 'Veiga, Nuphar', 'Raanani, Pia', 'Bairey, Osnat', 'Benjamini, Ohad', 'Nagler,

Dependent on age, major differences exist regarding disease frequency, main fusion partners and prognosis. In infants, up to 80% of acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL) bear a MLL translocation and half of them are t(4;11), resulting in a poor prognosis. In contrast, in adults only 10% of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) bear t(9;11) with an intermediate prognosis. The reasons for these differences are poorly understood. Recently, we established an efficient CRISPR/Cas9-based KMT2Ar model in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) derived from human cord blood (huCB) and faithfully mimicked the underlying biology of the disease. Here, we applied this model to HSPCs from adult bone marrow (huBM) to investigate the impact of the cell of origin and fusion partner on disease development. Both genome-edited infant and adult KMT2Ar cells showed monoclonal outgrowth with an immature morphology, myelomonocytic phenotype and elevated KMT2Ar target gene expression comparable to patient cells. Strikingly, all KMT2Ar cells presented with indefinite growth potential except for MLL-AF4 huBM cells ceasing proliferation after 80 days. We uncovered FFAR2, an epigenetic tumor suppressor, as potentially responsible for the inability of MLL-AF4 to immortalize adult cells under myeloid conditions.","['Secker, Kathy-Ann', 'Bruns, Lukas', 'Keppeler, Hildegard', 'Jeong, Johan', 'Hentrich, Thomas', 'Schulze-Hentrich, Julia M', 'Mankel, Barbara', 'Fend, Falko', 'Schneidawind, Dominik', 'Schneidawind, Corina']","['Secker KA', 'Bruns L', 'Keppeler H', 'Jeong J', 'Hentrich T', 'Schulze-Hentrich JM', 'Mankel B', 'Fend F', 'Schneidawind D', 'Schneidawind C']","['Department of Hematology, Oncology, Clinical Immunology and Rheumatology, University Hospital Tuebingen, 72076 Tuebingen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology, Clinical Immunology and Rheumatology, University Hospital Tuebingen, 72076 Tuebingen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology, Clinical Immunology and Rheumatology, University Hospital Tuebingen, 72076 Tuebingen, Germany.', 'Synthego Corporation, Menlo Park, CA 94025, USA.', 'Institute of Medical Genetics and Applied Genomics, University of Tuebingen, 72076 Tuebingen, Germany.', 'Institute of Medical Genetics and Applied Genomics, University of Tuebingen, 72076 Tuebingen, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology and Neuropathology, University of Tuebingen, 72076 Tuebingen, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology and Neuropathology, University of Tuebingen, 72076 Tuebingen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology, Clinical Immunology and Rheumatology, University Hospital Tuebingen, 72076 Tuebingen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology, Clinical Immunology and Rheumatology, University Hospital Tuebingen, 72076 Tuebingen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['2383-0-0/Interdisciplinary Centre for Clinical Research (IZKF)', '.../Wuerttembergischer Krebspreis', '.../Clinician Scientist Program of the Faculty of Medicine Tuebingen', 'Max Eder Junior Research Group Grant, 70112548/Deutsche Krebshilfe', 'Margarete-von-Wrangell fellowship/Ministry of Science, Research and the Arts', 'Baden-Wuerttemberg', '2386-0-0/Interdisciplinary Centre for Clinical Research (IZKF)', 'decipherPD transnational consortium on Epigenomics of Complex Diseases,', '01KU1503/Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung']",['Journal Article'],20200607,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,,,PMC7352867,['NOTNLM'],"['CRISPR/Cas9', 'KMT2A-rearranged leukemia', 'cell of origin']",2020/06/11 06:00,2020/06/11 06:01,['2020/06/11 06:00'],"['2020/04/15 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/01 00:00 [revised]', '2020/06/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/06/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/11 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers12061487 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers12061487 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2020 Jun 7;12(6). pii: cancers12061487. doi: 10.3390/cancers12061487.,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-1488-9096', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9242-2096', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7333-8980']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several cytogenetic and genomic alterations have been reported in the progression towards BC, but the precise molecular mechanisms of this event are undetermined. Transcription Factor 7 like 2 (TFC7L2) is a member of the TCF family of proteins that are known to activate WNT target genes such as Cyclin D1. TCF7L2 has been shown to be overexpressed in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and represents a druggable target. We report here that TCF7L2 transcription factor expression was found to be correlated to blast cell numbers during the progression of the disease. In these cells, TCF7L2 CHIP-sequencing highlighted distal cis active enhancer, such as elements in SMAD3, ATF5, and PRMT1 genomic regions and a proximal active transcriptional program of 144 genes. The analysis of CHIP-sequencing of MYC revealed a significant overlapping of TCF7L2 epigenetic program with MYC. The beta-catenin activator lithium chloride and the MYC-MAX dimerization inhibitor 10058-F4 significantly modified the expression of three epigenetic targets in the BC cell line K562. These results suggest for the first time the cooperative role of TCF7L2 and MYC during CML-BC and they strengthen previous data showing a possible involvement of embryonic genes in this process.","['Desterke, Christophe', 'Hugues, Patricia', 'Hwang, Jin Wook', 'Bennaceur-Griscelli, Annelise', 'Turhan, Ali G']","['Desterke C', 'Hugues P', 'Hwang JW', 'Bennaceur-Griscelli A', 'Turhan AG']","['INSERM U935, University Paris Saclay, 94802 Villejuif, France.', 'APHP Paris Saclay, University Paris Saclay, 94802 Villejuif, France.', 'INSERM U935, University Paris Saclay, 94802 Villejuif, France.', 'INSERM U935, University Paris Saclay, 94802 Villejuif, France.', 'INSERM U935, University Paris Saclay, 94802 Villejuif, France.', 'APHP Paris Saclay, University Paris Saclay, 94802 Villejuif, France.', 'INGESTEM Pluripotent Stem Cell Core Facility, 94802 Villejuif, France.', 'INSERM U935, University Paris Saclay, 94802 Villejuif, France.', 'APHP Paris Saclay, University Paris Saclay, 94802 Villejuif, France.', 'INGESTEM Pluripotent Stem Cell Core Facility, 94802 Villejuif, France.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200605,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (TCF7L2 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factor 7-Like 2 Protein)']",IM,"['Binding Sites', 'Blast Crisis/*genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromatin/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Hematopoiesis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Models, Biological', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells', 'Nucleotide Motifs', 'Protein Binding', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factor 7-Like 2 Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic']",PMC7312032,['NOTNLM'],"['MYC', 'TCF7L2', 'blast crisis', 'chronic myelogenous leukemia', 'epigenetics', 'leukemic stem cells']",2020/06/11 06:00,2021/02/16 06:00,['2020/06/11 06:00'],"['2020/04/21 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/02 00:00 [revised]', '2020/06/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/06/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/16 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms21114057 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms21114057 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2020 Jun 5;21(11). pii: ijms21114057. doi: 10.3390/ijms21114057.,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-7679-2524', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9170-397X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3557-4499', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4861-0137']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we introduce the Xdrop technology: a novel microfluidic-based system that allows for targeted enrichment of long DNA molecules starting from only a few nanograms of DNA. Xdrop is based on the isolation of long DNA fragments in millions of droplets, where the droplets containing a target sequence of interest are fluorescently labeled and sorted using flow cytometry. The final product from the Xdrop procedure is an enriched population of long DNA molecules that can be investigated by sequencing. To demonstrate the capability of Xdrop, we performed enrichment of the human papilloma virus 18 integrated into the genome of human HeLa cells. Analysis of the sequencing reads resolved three HPV18-chr8 integrations at base-pair resolution, and the captured fragments extended up to 30 kb into the human genome at the integration sites. Further, we enriched the complete TP53 locus in a leukemia cell line and could successfully phase coexisting mutations using PacBio sequencing. In summary, our results show that Xdrop is an efficient enrichment technology for studying complex genomic regions.","['Madsen, Esben B', 'Hoijer, Ida', 'Kvist, Thomas', 'Ameur, Adam', 'Mikkelsen, Marie J']","['Madsen EB', 'Hoijer I', 'Kvist T', 'Ameur A', 'Mikkelsen MJ']","['Samplix, Herlev, Denmark.', 'Science for Life Laboratory, Department of Immunology, Genetics and Pathology, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.', 'Samplix, Herlev, Denmark.', 'Science for Life Laboratory, Department of Immunology, Genetics and Pathology, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine, Monash University, Melbourne, Australia.', 'Samplix, Herlev, Denmark.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200629,United States,Hum Mutat,Human mutation,9215429,"['0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)']",IM,"['HeLa Cells', 'Human papillomavirus 18/genetics', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', '*Microfluidic Analytical Techniques', 'Nucleic Acid Amplification Techniques', '*Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', '*Sequence Analysis, DNA/methods', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics', 'Virus Integration']",PMC7496172,['NOTNLM'],"['*SMRT sequencing', '*Xdrop', '*long-read sequencing', '*nanopore sequencing', '*targeted enrichment', '*targeted sequencing']",2020/06/10 06:00,2021/11/11 06:00,['2020/06/10 06:00'],"['2019/08/15 00:00 [received]', '2020/04/29 00:00 [revised]', '2020/06/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/11 06:00 [medline]', '2020/06/10 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/humu.24063 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Mutat. 2020 Sep;41(9):1671-1679. doi: 10.1002/humu.24063.

METHODS: Children diagnosed with ALL at age 14 years and younger at Regional Cancer Centre in South India who completed treatment and who were on follow-up for >2 years were enrolled in the study between April 1, 2018 and March 31, 2019. They were prospectively evaluated for the presence of metabolic syndrome (MS) and associated risk factors. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: A total of 277 survivors of pediatric ALL were recruited during the study period. MS was present in 8.3% (n=23) and 6% (n=13) survivors by National Cholesterol Education Programme Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEPATP III) and International Diabetes Federation (IDF) criteria, respectively. The prevalence of overweight and obesity in the survivors was 9% and 13%. The prevalence of increased waist circumference, low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, elevated triglycerides, elevated fasting glucose, and increased blood pressure were 10.5%, 28.9%, 24.9%, 2.5%, and 9%, respectively. Overweight/obese survivors were at an increased risk for developing MS (odds ratio=17.66; 95% confidence interval=6.2-50.16, P=0.001). Survivors who received cranial radiotherapy were at an elevated risk for having low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (P=0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In our study, the prevalence of MS was higher in childhood ALL survivors, as compared with the general population. The study points to the need for regular screening of pediatric ALL survivors for early detection of MS, along with lifestyle modification in those with metabolic abnormalities, to curb the growing incidence of coronary artery disease.","['Nirmal, Garima', 'Thankamony, Priyakumari', 'Chellapam Sojamani, Guruprasad', 'Nair, Manjusha', 'Rajeswari, Binitha', 'Varikkattu Rajendran, Prasanth', 'Krishna K M, Jagathnath']","['Nirmal G', 'Thankamony P', 'Chellapam Sojamani G', 'Nair M', 'Rajeswari B', 'Varikkattu Rajendran P', 'Krishna K M J']","['Departments of Pediatric Oncology.', 'Departments of Pediatric Oncology.', 'Departments of Pediatric Oncology.', 'Departments of Pediatric Oncology.', 'Departments of Pediatric Oncology.', 'Departments of Pediatric Oncology.', 'Cancer Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Regional Cancer Centre, Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, India.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Cancer Survivors/*statistics & numerical data', 'Child', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'India/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Metabolic Syndrome/*epidemiology/etiology/pathology', 'Obesity/*physiopathology', 'Overweight/*physiopathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications', 'Prevalence', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Young Adult']",,,,2020/06/10 06:00,2021/04/07 06:00,['2020/06/10 06:00'],"['2020/03/31 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/07 06:00 [medline]', '2020/06/10 06:00 [entrez]']","['00043426-202103000-00010 [pii]', '10.1097/MPH.0000000000001856 [doi]']",ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2021 Mar 1;43(2):e154-e158. doi: 10.1097/MPH.0000000000001856.,,['The authors declare no conflict of interest.'],"['Copyright (c) 2020 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Accordingly, aim of this cross-sectional study was to assess OHRQoL and its associations to different parameters in adult patients with newly diagnosed acute leukaemia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Participants with first diagnosis of acute leukaemia were consecutively recruited in the Clinic of Hematology and Oncology of the University Medical Center Goettingen. OHRQoL was assessed using the German short form of oral health impact profile (OHIP-G14). Presence of oral initial symptoms, dental health (decayed- [D-T], missing- [M-T] and filled-teeth index [DMF-T]), dental behaviour and periodontal disease severity were assessed. For comparison, a healthy control group (HC) was recruited. RESULTS: Thirty-nine patients with leukaemia and 38 HC were included. In the leukaemia group, a statistically significant and clinically relevant higher OHIP-sum score compared to HC was found (6.13 [3; 0-7] vs 0.87 [0; 0-2], p <0.01). The different subaspects of OHRQoL (patterns) 'oral function' and 'orofacial appearance' were statistically significantly worse in the leukaemia group (p <0.01). Time since diagnosis showed a clinically relevant association to the pattern 'psychosocial impact' (p = 0.06). Patients with oral initial symptoms had a statistically significantly worse OHIP-sum score (p <0.04, V = 0.775). DMF-T (p = 0.03, r = 0.242) and M-T (p = 0.03, r = 0.252) showed an association to OHIP sum score. Moreover, D-T (p = 0.03, r = 0.253) and M-T (p = 0.01, r = 0.296) were associated to orofacial appearance. Additionally, M-T showed an association to pattern 'oral function' (p = 0.01, r = 0.277). CONCLUSION: Patients with newly diagnosed acute leukaemia show a reduced OHRQoL. This might be particularly caused by oral health situation, especially oral initial symptoms as well as missing teeth.","['Schmalz, Gerhard', 'Busjan, Rilana', 'Dietl, Marit', 'Hasenkamp, Justin', 'Trumper, Lorenz', 'Ziebolz, Dirk']","['Schmalz G', 'Busjan R', 'Dietl M', 'Hasenkamp J', 'Trumper L', 'Ziebolz D']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Germany,Oral Health Prev Dent,Oral health & preventive dentistry,101167768,,IM,"['Adult', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Humans', '*Leukemia', '*Oral Health', 'Quality of Life', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",,['NOTNLM'],"['acute leukaemia', 'oral health', 'oral health-related quality of life', 'oral initial symptoms']",2020/06/10 06:00,2020/06/11 06:00,['2020/06/10 06:00'],"['2020/06/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/06/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/11 06:00 [medline]']","['842319 [pii]', '10.3290/j.ohpd.a44685 [doi]']",ppublish,Oral Health Prev Dent. 2020;18(1):461-466. doi: 10.3290/j.ohpd.a44685.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVE: To characterize the plasma proteome profile in occupational dermatitis in workers of paint industry. METHODS: The study has a case-control design, comparing exposed workers with and without occupational contact dermatitis, matched for age, gender, occupational history, and comorbidities. An immunological assay (Human XL Cytokine Array Kit - ARY022B, R&D Systems) was used to measure the plasma levels of 105 cytokines and chemokines in a pooled sample of the cases and a pooled sample of the controls. RESULTS: A 1.5-fold increase was noticed for interleukin 3, interleukin 10, and leptin in cases, as compared to controls. Fibroblast growth factor-7 and growth/differentiation factor-15 showed a 1.4-fold increase, while interleukin 19, interleukin 31, and macrophage inflammatory protein 3a.had only a 1.3- fold increase. The leukemia inhibitory factor was the only plasma cytokine that showed a 1.3-fold decrease. All other cytokines had a variation of less than 1.2-fold between cases and controls. CONCLUSION: The recognition of the molecular signatures is very important for an accurate and indisputable diagnosis of occupational contact dermatitis. In workers from the paint industry, plasma levels of interleukins 3, 10, 13 and 19, fibroblast growth factor-7, and growth/differentiation factor-15, together with leukemia inducible factor, may differentiate subjects with contact dermatitis from those without skin lesions.","['Rascu, Alexandra M', 'Otelea, Marina R', 'Mambet, Cristina', 'Handra, Claudia', 'Neagu, Ana I', 'Rascu, Agripina', 'Giurcaneanu, Calin', 'Diaconu, Carmen C']","['Rascu AM', 'Otelea MR', 'Mambet C', 'Handra C', 'Neagu AI', 'Rascu A', 'Giurcaneanu C', 'Diaconu CC']","['Clinic Department, ""Carol Davila"" University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Bucharest, Romania.', 'Clinic Department, ""Carol Davila"" University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Bucharest, Romania.', 'Stefan S.

In recent decades, exposure to ELF-EMF has emerged potential concerns on public health. Here, we discuss recent progress in the understanding of ELF-EMF biology with a focus on mechanisms of ELF-EMF-mediated disease and summarize the results of more recent experimental and epidemiological studies of ELF-EMF exposure effects on cancer, neurological, cardiovascular, and reproductive disorders. Current views on genomic instability effects, as well as scientific evidence about ELF-EMF therapy, are put forth. According to our literature review, exposure to ELF-EMF has an adverse biological effect depending on the current intensity, strength of the magnetic field, and duration of exposure. Accumulated epidemiologic evidence indicates a correlation between exposure to ELF-EMF and childhood cancer incidence, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and miscarriage. However, adult cancer does not show augmented risk caused by the ELF-EMF. Also, no consistent evidence exists in cardiovascular disease mortality due to ELF-EMF exposure. There is a lack of comprehensive mechanisms for explaining the biological effect of ELF-EMF. Eventually, more studies are needed to clarify the mechanisms of these magnetic fields.","['Karimi, Abbas', 'Ghadiri Moghaddam, Farzaneh', 'Valipour, Masoumeh']","['Karimi A', 'Ghadiri Moghaddam F', 'Valipour M']","['Biotechnology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran. karimia@tbzmed.ac.ir.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, Faculty of Advanced Medical Sciences, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran. karimia@tbzmed.ac.ir.', 'Biotechnology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Department of Biology, Faculty of Science, Azarbaijan Shahid Madani University, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Department of Biology, Faculty of Science, Azarbaijan Shahid Madani University, Tabriz, Iran.']",['eng'],"['61741/Biotechnology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences']","['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200608,Netherlands,Mol Biol Rep,Molecular biology reports,0403234,,IM,"['Disease/etiology', 'Electromagnetic Fields/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Magnetic Fields/*adverse effects', 'Neoplasms/etiology']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Alzheimer disease', 'Extremely low-frequency electromagnetic fields (ELF-EMFs)', 'Fertility', 'Leukemia', 'Long-term exposure']",2020/06/10 06:00,2021/06/08 06:00,['2020/06/10 06:00'],"['2020/04/16 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/08 06:00 [medline]', '2020/06/10 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s11033-020-05563-8 [doi]', '10.1007/s11033-020-05563-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Mol Biol Rep. 2020 Jul;47(7):5621-5633. doi: 10.1007/s11033-020-05563-8.

Combination with antifungal prophylaxis challenges clinicians due to pharmacological profiles prone to drug-drug interactions (DDI). Midostaurin is a novel agent for FLT3-TKD/-ITD(mut)-acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and metabolized via cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4). Posaconazole is a standard of care antifungal agent used for prophylaxis during induction treatment of AML and a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor. Concomitant administration of both drugs leads to elevated midostaurin exposure. Both drugs improve overall survival at low numbers needed to treat. The impact of CYP3A4-related DDI remains to be determined. Severe adverse events have been observed; however, it remains unclear if they can be directly linked to DDI. The lack of prospective clinical studies assessing incidence of invasive fungal infections and clinical impact of DDI contributes to neglecting live-saving antifungal prophylaxis. Management strategies to combine both drugs have been proposed, but evidence on which approach to use is scarce. In this review, we discuss several approaches in the specific clinical setting of concomitant administration of midostaurin and posaconazole and give examples from everyday clinical practice. Therapeutic drug monitoring will become increasingly important to individualize and personalize antineoplastic concomitant and antifungal treatment in the context of DDI. Pharmaceutical companies addressing the issue in clinical trials may take a pioneer role in this field.

The current study includes 80 CN-AML (</= 60 years) before the start of therapy. Blast cells expression for CD25 and CD123 were identified by flowcytometry in fresh bone marrow samples. CD25+/CD123-; CD25-/CD123+. CD25+/CD123+, CD25-/CD123- expression were as follow: 10/80 (12.5%); 18/80 (22.5%); 17/80; (21.25%), 35/80 (43.5%) respectively. The total CD25 expression was detected in 27/80 (33.75%), and CD123 expression was detected in 35/80 (43.75%%). CN-AML patients showed CD25+/CD123+ co-expression had the lowest induction remission rate and the shortest overall survival as compared to those lack co-expressions (P <0.01; P=0.023 respectively). Also, there is strong positive association between CD25+/CD123+ co-expression and FLT3 mutations (P<0.001) and negative one with NPM1 mutation (P<0.001). In conclusion: CD25+/CD123+ co-expression in CN-AML patients define a subgroup of patients with adverse outcome. Identification of CD25/CD123 expression in CN-AML patents at diagnosis could be included in risk stratification.

However, with extension of the follow-up period, the limitations of this therapy have gradually emerged. Patients are at a high risk of early relapse after achieving complete remission. Although there are many studies with a primary focus on the mechanisms underlying CD19(-) relapse related to immune escape, early CD19(+) relapse owing to poor in vivo persistence and impaired efficacy accounts for a larger proportion of the high relapse rate. However, the mechanisms underlying CD19(+) relapse are still poorly understood. Herein, we discuss factors that could become obstacles to improved persistence and efficacy of CAR T cells during production, preinfusion processing, and in vivo interactions in detail. Furthermore, we propose potential strategies to overcome these barriers to achieve a reduced CD19(+) relapse rate and produce prolonged survival in patients after CAR T cell therapy.","['Nie, Yuru', 'Lu, Weiqing', 'Chen, Daiyu', 'Tu, Huilin', 'Guo, Zhenling', 'Zhou, Xuan', 'Li, Meifang', 'Tu, Sanfang', 'Li, Yuhua']","['Nie Y', 'Lu W', 'Chen D', 'Tu H', 'Guo Z', 'Zhou X', 'Li M', 'Tu S', 'Li Y']","['Second Clinical Medical College, Southern Medical University, No. 253, Industrial Avenue, Guangzhou, Guangdong Province China.grid.284723.80000 0000 8877 7471', 'Second Clinical Medical College, Southern Medical University, No. 253, Industrial Avenue, Guangzhou, Guangdong Province China.grid.284723.80000 0000 8877 7471', 'Second Clinical Medical College, Southern Medical University, No. 253, Industrial Avenue, Guangzhou, Guangdong Province China.grid.284723.80000 0000 8877 7471', 'Second Clinical Medical College, Southern Medical University, No. 253, Industrial Avenue, Guangzhou, Guangdong Province China.grid.284723.80000 0000 8877 7471', 'Department of Hematology, Zhujiang Hospital, Southern Medical University, No. 253, Industrial Avenue, Guangzhou, Guangdong Province China.grid.284723.80000 0000 8877 7471', 'Department of Hematology, Zhujiang Hospital, Southern Medical University, No. 253, Industrial Avenue, Guangzhou, Guangdong Province China.grid.284723.80000 0000 8877 7471', 'Department of Hematology, Zhujiang Hospital, Southern Medical University, No. 253, Industrial Avenue, Guangzhou, Guangdong Province China.grid.284723.80000 0000 8877 7471', 'Department of Hematology, Zhujiang Hospital, Southern Medical University, No. 253, Industrial Avenue, Guangzhou, Guangdong Province China.grid.284723.80000 0000 8877 7471', 'Department of Hematology, Zhujiang Hospital, Southern Medical University, No. 253, Industrial Avenue, Guangzhou, Guangdong Province China.grid.284723.80000 0000 8877 7471']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200527,England,Biomark Res,Biomarker research,101607860,,,,PMC7254656,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL)', 'CAR T cell therapy', 'Chimeric antigen receptor', 'Mechanism', 'Positive relapse', 'Strategy']",2020/06/10 06:00,2020/06/10 06:01,['2020/06/10 06:00'],"['2020/02/11 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/06/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/10 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s40364-020-00197-1 [doi]', '197 [pii]']",epublish,Biomark Res. 2020 May 27;8:18. doi: 10.1186/s40364-020-00197-1. eCollection 2020.,['ORCID: 0000-0001-7174-0338'],['Competing interestsThe authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.'],['(c) The Author(s) 2020.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent studies demonstrated that GSK-J4 could affect the proliferation and apoptosis of a variety of cancer cells. However, the effects and underlying mechanisms of GSK-J4 on the proliferation and apoptosis of human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) KG-1a cells have not been explored thoroughly. Methods: The effect of GSK-J4 on cell proliferation was assessed with CCK8, while cell cycle distribution and apoptosis were analyzed using flow cytometry. The proteins related to cell cycle, cell apoptosis, endoplastic reticulum (ER) stress and PKC-alpha/p-Bcl2 pathway were detected by Western blotting. The expression level of PKC-alpha mRNA was measured by quantitative real-time PCR.ER stress inhibitor 4-phenyl butyric acid (4-PBA) was used to explore the role of ER stress in GSK-J4 induced cell-cycle arrest and cell apoptosis. The combination effects of Decitabine and GSK-J4 on KG-1a cells proliferation and apoptosis were also evaluated by CCK8, flow cytometry and immunoblot analysis. Results: GSK-J4 reduced cell viability and arrested cell cycle progression at the S phase by decreasing the expression of CyclinD1 and CyclinA2 and increasing that of P21. Moreover, GSK-J4 enhanced the expression of apoptosis-related proteins (cle-caspase-9 and bax) and inhibited PKC-a/p-Bcl2 pathway to promote cell apoptosis. In addition, ER stress-related proteins (caspase-12, GRP78 and ATF4) were increased markedly after exposure to GSK-J4. The effects of GSK-J4 on cell cycle, apoptosis and PKC-a/p-Bcl2 pathway were attenuated after treatment with ER stress inhibitor. Furthermore, decitabine could significantly inhibit the proliferation and induce the apoptosis of KG-1a cells after combined treatment with GSK-J4. Conclusion: Taken together, this study provided evidence that ER stress could regulate the process of GSK-J4-induced cell cycle arrest, cell apoptosis and PKC-alpha/p-bcl2 pathway inhibition and demonstrated a potential combinatory effect of decitabine and GSK-J4 on leukemic cell proliferation and apoptosis.","['Chu, Xuan', 'Zhong, Liang', 'Yu, Lihua', 'Xiong, Ling', 'Li, Jian', 'Dan, Wenran', 'Ye, Jiao', 'Liu, Chen', 'Luo, Xu', 'Liu, Beizhong']","['Chu X', 'Zhong L', 'Yu L', 'Xiong L', 'Li J', 'Dan W', 'Ye J', 'Liu C', 'Luo X', 'Liu B']","['Central Laboratory of Yongchuan Hospital, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, 402160 China.grid.203458.80000 0000 8653 0555', 'Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medical Diagnostics, Ministry of Education, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, 400016 China.grid.203458.80000 0000 8653 0555', 'Clinical Laboratory of YongChuan Hospital, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, 402160 China.grid.203458.80000 0000 8653 0555', 'Central Laboratory of Yongchuan Hospital, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, 402160 China.grid.203458.80000 0000 8653 0555', 'Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medical Diagnostics, Ministry of Education, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, 400016 China.grid.203458.80000 0000 8653 0555', 'Central Laboratory of Yongchuan Hospital, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, 402160 China.grid.203458.80000 0000 8653 0555', 'Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medical Diagnostics, Ministry of Education, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, 400016 China.grid.203458.80000 0000 8653 0555', 'Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medical Diagnostics, Ministry of Education, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, 400016 China.grid.203458.80000 0000 8653 0555', 'Central Laboratory of Yongchuan Hospital, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, 402160 China.grid.203458.80000 0000 8653 0555', 'Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medical Diagnostics, Ministry of Education, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, 400016 China.grid.203458.80000 0000 8653 0555', 'Clinical Laboratory of YongChuan Hospital, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, 402160 China.grid.203458.80000 0000 8653 0555']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200603,England,Cancer Cell Int,Cancer cell international,101139795,,,,PMC7268296,['NOTNLM'],"['Cell apoptosis', 'Cell cycle', 'Decitabine', 'ER stress', 'GSK-J4', 'KG-1a cells', 'PKC-alpha/p-bcl2 pathway']",2020/06/10 06:00,2020/06/10 06:01,['2020/06/10 06:00'],"['2020/04/02 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/06/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/10 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12935-020-01297-6 [doi]', '1297 [pii]']",epublish,Cancer Cell Int. 2020 Jun 3;20:209. doi: 10.1186/s12935-020-01297-6. eCollection 2020.,['ORCID: 0000-0001-8360-6646'],"['Competing interestsThe authors declare that that they have no competing', 'interests.']",['(c) The Author(s) 2020.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In mammals, CTCF and the cohesin complex create submegabase structures with elevated internal chromatin contact frequencies, called topologically associating domains (TADs)(8-12). Although TADs can contribute to transcriptional regulation, ablation of TAD organization by disrupting CTCF or the cohesin complex causes modest gene expression changes(13-16). In contrast, CTCF is required for cell cycle regulation(17), embryonic development and formation of various adult cell types(18). To uncouple the role of CTCF in cell-state transitions and cell proliferation, we studied the effect of CTCF depletion during the conversion of human leukemic B cells into macrophages with minimal cell division. CTCF depletion disrupts TAD organization but not cell transdifferentiation. In contrast, CTCF depletion in induced macrophages impairs the full-blown upregulation of inflammatory genes after exposure to endotoxin. Our results demonstrate that CTCF-dependent genome topology is not strictly required for a functional cell-fate conversion but facilitates a rapid and efficient response to an external stimulus.","['Stik, Gregoire', 'Vidal, Enrique', 'Barrero, Mercedes', 'Cuartero, Sergi', 'Vila-Casadesus, Maria', 'Mendieta-Esteban, Julen', 'Tian, Tian V', 'Choi, Jinmi', 'Berenguer, Clara', 'Abad, Amaya', 'Borsari, Beatrice', 'le Dily, Francois', 'Cramer, Patrick', 'Marti-Renom, Marc A', 'Stadhouders, Ralph', 'Graf, Thomas']","['Stik G', 'Vidal E', 'Barrero M', 'Cuartero S', 'Vila-Casadesus M', 'Mendieta-Esteban J', 'Tian TV', 'Choi J', 'Berenguer C', 'Abad A', 'Borsari B', 'le Dily F', 'Cramer P', 'Marti-Renom MA', 'Stadhouders R', 'Graf T']","['Centre for Genomic Regulation (CRG) and Institute of Science and Technology (BIST), Barcelona, Spain. gregoire.stik@crg.eu.', 'Centre for Genomic Regulation (CRG) and Institute of Science and Technology (BIST), Barcelona, Spain.', 'Centre for Genomic Regulation (CRG) and Institute of Science and Technology (BIST), Barcelona, Spain.', 'Centre for Genomic Regulation (CRG) and Institute of Science and Technology (BIST), Barcelona, Spain.', 'Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute (IJC), Barcelona, Spain.', 'Centre for Genomic Regulation (CRG) and Institute of Science and Technology (BIST), Barcelona, Spain.', 'CNAG-CRG, Centre for Genomic Regulation (CRG), Barcelona Institute of Science and Technology (BIST), Barcelona, Spain.', 'Centre for Genomic Regulation (CRG) and Institute of Science and Technology (BIST), Barcelona, Spain.', ""Vall d'Hebron Institute of Oncology (VHIO), Barcelona, Spain."", 'Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry, Gottingen, Germany.', 'Centre for Genomic Regulation (CRG) and Institute of Science and Technology (BIST), Barcelona, Spain.', 'Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute (IJC), Barcelona, Spain.', 'Centre for Genomic Regulation (CRG) and Institute of Science and Technology (BIST), Barcelona, Spain.', 'Centre for Genomic Regulation (CRG) and Institute of Science and Technology (BIST), Barcelona, Spain.', 'Centre for Genomic Regulation (CRG) and Institute of Science and Technology (BIST), Barcelona, Spain.', 'Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry, Gottingen, Germany.', 'Centre for Genomic Regulation (CRG) and Institute of Science and Technology (BIST), Barcelona, Spain.', 'CNAG-CRG, Centre for Genomic Regulation (CRG), Barcelona Institute of Science and Technology (BIST), Barcelona, Spain.', 'ICREA, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Department of Pulmonary Medicine, Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, the Netherlands. r.stadhouders@erasmusmc.nl.', 'Department of Cell Biology, Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, the Netherlands. r.stadhouders@erasmusmc.nl.', 'Centre for Genomic Regulation (CRG) and Institute of Science and Technology (BIST), Barcelona, Spain. thomas.graf@crg.eu.', 'Universitat Pompeu Fabra (UPF), Barcelona, Spain. thomas.graf@crg.eu.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200608,United States,Nat Genet,Nature genetics,9216904,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (CCCTC-Binding Factor)', '0 (CTCF protein, human)', '0 (Chromatin)']",IM,"['Antigens, Differentiation/metabolism', 'B-Lymphocytes/*physiology', 'CCCTC-Binding Factor/genetics/*physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/physiology', 'Chromatin/physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Macrophages/*physiology', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Myelopoiesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Protein Conformation']",,,,2020/06/10 06:00,2020/10/02 06:00,['2020/06/10 06:00'],"['2019/11/12 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/02 06:00 [medline]', '2020/06/10 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41588-020-0643-0 [doi]', '10.1038/s41588-020-0643-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Nat Genet. 2020 Jul;52(7):655-661. doi: 10.1038/s41588-020-0643-0.

The absence or defective function of XIAP leads to the development of a rare and severe primary immunodeficiency known as X-linked lymphoproliferative syndrome type 2 (XLP-2), which is characterized by a triad of clinical manifestations, including a high incidence of haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), lymphoproliferation and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), usually with very early onset. Here, we present a novel XIAP mutation identified in a patient with atypical adult-onset IBD complicated by relapsing HLH, splenomegaly and sarcoid-like disease. The c.266delA mutation in the XIAP gene creates a premature stop codon, and causes a severe reduction in XIAP protein expression. The mutation is also associated with impaired spontaneous and staurosporine- and PMA-induced apoptosis accompanied by significantly increased expression of pro-apoptotic genes. We also confirmed the negative impact of this particular XIAP mutation on NOD2-dependent NFkappaB and MAPK activation, while NOD2-independent activation was found to be unaffected. Moreover, we assume that the mutation has an impact on the overproduction of IL-12 and IFNgamma, the shift towards the Th1 immune response and increased numbers of central memory and effector memory CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. All these changes contribute to immune dysregulation and the clinical manifestation of XLP-2.","['Parackova, Zuzana', 'Milota, Tomas', 'Vrabcova, Petra', 'Smetanova, Jitka', 'Svaton, Michael', 'Freiberger, Tomas', 'Kanderova, Veronika', 'Sediva, Anna']","['Parackova Z', 'Milota T', 'Vrabcova P', 'Smetanova J', 'Svaton M', 'Freiberger T', 'Kanderova V', 'Sediva A']","['Department of Immunology, 2nd Faculty of Medicine Charles University, University Hospital in Motol, V Uvalu 84, Prague, Czech Republic. zuzana.parackova@fnmotol.cz.', 'Department of Immunology, 2nd Faculty of Medicine Charles University, University Hospital in Motol, V Uvalu 84, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Immunology, 2nd Faculty of Medicine Charles University, University Hospital in Motol, V Uvalu 84, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Immunology, 2nd Faculty of Medicine Charles University, University Hospital in Motol, V Uvalu 84, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'CLIP-Childhood Leukaemia Investigation Prague, Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, 2nd Faculty of Medicine, Charles University and University Hospital Motol, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Molecular Genetics Laboratory, Center of Cardiovascular Surgery and Transplantation, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'CLIP-Childhood Leukaemia Investigation Prague, Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, 2nd Faculty of Medicine, Charles University and University Hospital Motol, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Immunology, 2nd Faculty of Medicine Charles University, University Hospital in Motol, V Uvalu 84, Prague, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200608,England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,"['0 (NOD2 protein, human)', '0 (Nod2 Signaling Adaptor Protein)', '0 (X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein)', '0 (XIAP protein, human)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Apoptosis', 'Crohn Disease/*genetics/pathology', 'Humans', 'Mutation', 'Nod2 Signaling Adaptor Protein/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein/*metabolism']",PMC7280281,,,2020/06/10 06:00,2021/04/13 06:00,['2020/06/10 06:00'],"['2020/01/23 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/07 00:00 [revised]', '2020/06/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/06/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/13 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41419-020-2652-4 [doi]', '10.1038/s41419-020-2652-4 [pii]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2020 Jun 8;11(6):430. doi: 10.1038/s41419-020-2652-4.,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6532-7053'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, a subset of melanomas are difficult-to-treat. These melanomas include those without the genetic markers for targeted therapy, non-responsive to immunotherapy, and those who have relapsed or exhausted their therapeutic options. Therefore, it is necessary to understand and explore other biological processes that may provide new therapeutic approaches. One of most appealing is targeting the apoptotic/anti-apoptotic system that is effective against leukemia. We used genetic knockdown and pharmacologic approaches of BH3 mimetics to target anti-apoptotic BCL2 family members and identified MCL1 and BCLXL as crucial pro-survival members in melanoma. We then examined the effects of combining BH3 mimetics to target MCL1 and BCLXL in vitro and in vivo. These include clinical-trial-ready compounds such as ABT-263 (Navitoclax) and S63845/S64315 (MIK655). We used cell lines derived from patients with difficult-to-treat melanomas. In vitro, the combined inhibition of MCL1 and BCLXL resulted in significantly effective cell killing compared to single-agent treatment (p < 0.05) in multiple assays, including sphere assays. The combination-induced cell death was independent of BIM, and NOXA. Recapitulated in our mouse xenograft model, the combination inhibited tumor growth, reduced sphere-forming capacity (p < 0.01 and 0.05, respectively), and had tolerable toxicity (p > 0.40). Taken together, this study suggests that dual targeting of MCL1 and BCLXL should be considered as a treatment option for difficult-to-treat melanoma patients.","['Mukherjee, Nabanita', 'Skees, Jenette', 'Todd, Kaleb J', 'West, Drake A', 'Lambert, Karoline A', 'Robinson, William A', 'Amato, Carol M', 'Couts, Kasey L', 'Van Gulick, Robert', 'MacBeth, Morgan', 'Nassar, Kelsey', 'Tan, Aik-Choon', 'Zhai, Zili', 'Fujita, Mayumi', 'Bagby, Stacey M', 'Dart, Chiara R', 'Lambert, James R', 'Norris, David A', 'Shellman, Yiqun G']","['Mukherjee N', 'Skees J', 'Todd KJ', 'West DA', 'Lambert KA', 'Robinson WA', 'Amato CM', 'Couts KL', 'Van Gulick R', 'MacBeth M', 'Nassar K', 'Tan AC', 'Zhai Z', 'Fujita M', 'Bagby SM', 'Dart CR', 'Lambert JR', 'Norris DA', 'Shellman YG']","['Department of Dermatology, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, School of Medicine, Mail Stop 8127, Aurora, CO, 80045, US.', 'Department of Dermatology, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, School of Medicine, Mail Stop 8127, Aurora, CO, 80045, US.', 'Department of Dermatology, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, School of Medicine, Mail Stop 8127, Aurora, CO, 80045, US.', 'Department of Dermatology, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, School of Medicine, Mail Stop 8127, Aurora, CO, 80045, US.', 'Department of Dermatology, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, School of Medicine, Mail Stop 8127, Aurora, CO, 80045, US.', 'University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, School of Medicine, Division of Medical Oncology, Mail Stop 8117, Aurora, CO, 80045, US.', 'University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, School of Medicine, Division of Medical Oncology, Mail Stop 8117, Aurora, CO, 80045, US.', 'University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, School of Medicine, Division of Medical Oncology, Mail Stop 8117, Aurora, CO, 80045, US.', 'University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, School of Medicine, Division of Medical Oncology, Mail Stop 8117, Aurora, CO, 80045, US.', 'University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, School of Medicine, Division of Medical Oncology, Mail Stop 8117, Aurora, CO, 80045, US.', 'University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, School of Medicine, Division of Medical Oncology, Mail Stop 8117, Aurora, CO, 80045, US.', 'University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, School of Medicine, Division of Medical Oncology, Mail Stop 8117, Aurora, CO, 80045, US.', 'Department of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics, Moffitt Cancer Center, 12902 Magnolia Drive, Tampa, FL, 33612, US.', 'Department of Dermatology, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, School of Medicine, Mail Stop 8127, Aurora, CO, 80045, US.', 'Department of Dermatology, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, School of Medicine, Mail Stop 8127, Aurora, CO, 80045, US.', 'University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, School of Medicine, Division of Medical Oncology, Mail Stop 8117, Aurora, CO, 80045, US.', 'University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, School of Medicine, Division of Medical Oncology, Mail Stop 8117, Aurora, CO, 80045, US.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, School of Medicine, Mail Stop 8104, Aurora, CO, 80045, US.', 'Department of Dermatology, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, School of Medicine, Mail Stop 8127, Aurora, CO, 80045, US.', 'Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Dermatology Section, Denver, CO, 80220, US.', 'Department of Dermatology, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, School of Medicine, Mail Stop 8127, Aurora, CO, 80045, US.

Here we analyzed the expression of TIGIT and its ligands poliovirus receptor (PVR) and nectin-2 in the bone marrow (BM) of patients with monoclonal gammopathies and the efficacy of TIGIT blockade activating antimyeloma immunity. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Expression levels of TIGIT and its ligands were characterized by flow cytometry and ELISA. TIGIT blockade was analyzed in in vitro functional assays with peripheral T cells. BM cells were studied with NanoString technology, real-time PCR, and ex vivo patient BM cell models. RESULTS: TIGIT and its ligands are highly expressed in the BM of patients with multiple myeloma, suggesting that may play a role in restraining immune activation. TIGIT blockade depleted FoxP3(+) Tregs while increasing proliferation of IFNgamma-producing CD4(+) T cells from patients with multiple myeloma. PVR ligation inhibited CD8(+) T-cell signaling and cell proliferation which could be overcome with anti-TIGIT mAb. However, BM cells showed a remarkable heterogeneity in immune signature. Accordingly, functional ex vivo BM assays revealed that only some patients respond to checkpoint blockade. Thus, response to TIGIT blockade correlated with low frequency of TIGIT(+) cells and high nectin-2 expression on malignant plasma cells. CONCLUSIONS: TIGIT blockade efficiently reinvigorated peripheral T cells from patients with multiple myeloma. However, in the BM, the efficacy of blocking anti-TIGIT mAb to achieve tumor cell death may depend on the expression of TIGIT and nectin-2, becoming potential predictive biomarkers for identifying patients who may benefit from TIGIT blockade.","['Lozano, Ester', 'Mena, Mari-Pau', 'Diaz, Tania', 'Martin-Antonio, Beatriz', 'Leon, Sheila', 'Rodriguez-Lobato, Luis-Gerardo', 'Oliver-Caldes, Aina', 'Cibeira, Maria Teresa', 'Blade, Joan', 'Prat, Aleix', 'Rosinol, Laura', 'Fernandez de Larrea, Carlos']","['Lozano E', 'Mena MP', 'Diaz T', 'Martin-Antonio B', 'Leon S', 'Rodriguez-Lobato LG', 'Oliver-Caldes A', 'Cibeira MT', 'Blade J', 'Prat A', 'Rosinol L', 'Fernandez de Larrea C']","[""Department of Hematology, Hospital Clinic de Barcelona, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Barcelona, Spain. elozano@ub.edu cfernan1@clinic.cat."", 'Department of Cell Biology, Physiology and Immunology, Faculty of Biology, University of Barcelona, and Institute of Biomedicine of the University of Barcelona (IBUB), Barcelona, Spain.', ""Department of Hematology, Hospital Clinic de Barcelona, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Barcelona, Spain."", ""Department of Hematology, Hospital Clinic de Barcelona, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Barcelona, Spain."", ""Department of Hematology, Hospital Clinic de Barcelona, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Barcelona, Spain."", 'Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute, Barcelona, Spain.', ""Department of Hematology, Hospital Clinic de Barcelona, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Barcelona, Spain."", ""Department of Hematology, Hospital Clinic de Barcelona, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Barcelona, Spain."", ""Department of Hematology, Hospital Clinic de Barcelona, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Barcelona, Spain."", ""Department of Hematology, Hospital Clinic de Barcelona, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Barcelona, Spain."", ""Department of Hematology, Hospital Clinic de Barcelona, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Barcelona, Spain."", ""Department of Medical Oncology, Hospital Clinic de Barcelona, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Barcelona, Spain."", ""Department of Hematology, Hospital Clinic de Barcelona, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Barcelona, Spain."", ""Department of Hematology, Hospital Clinic de Barcelona, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Barcelona, Spain. elozano@ub.edu cfernan1@clinic.cat.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Observational Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200608,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (NECTIN2 protein, human)', '0 (Nectins)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (TIGIT protein, human)', '0 (poliovirus receptor)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis/*metabolism', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Clinical Decision-Making', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Nectins/analysis/*metabolism', 'Patient Selection', 'Plasma Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Receptors, Virus/analysis/metabolism', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,,2020/06/10 06:00,2021/11/26 06:00,['2020/06/10 06:00'],"['2019/11/13 00:00 [received]', '2020/04/08 00:00 [revised]', '2020/06/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/26 06:00 [medline]', '2020/06/10 06:00 [entrez]']","['1078-0432.CCR-19-3673 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-19-3673 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2020 Sep 1;26(17):4688-4698. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-19-3673.

It has been reported that RIG-I recognizes virus-specific 5'-ppp-double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and activates the type I interferons signaling pathways in innate immunity. However, the functions of RIG-I in hematopoiesis remain unclear, especially regarding its possible interaction with endogenous RNAs and the associated pathways that could contribute to the cellular differentiation and maturation. Herein, we identified a number of RIG-I-binding endogenous RNAs in APL cells following ATRA treatment, including the tripartite motif-containing protein 25 (TRIM25) messenger RNA (mRNA). TRIM25 encodes the protein known as an E3 ligase for ubiquitin/interferon (IFN)-induced 15-kDa protein (ISG15) that is involved in RIG-I-mediated antiviral signaling. We show that RIG-I could bind TRIM25 mRNA via its helicase domain and C-terminal regulatory domain, enhancing the stability of TRIM25 transcripts. RIG-I could increase the transcriptional expression of TRIM25 by caspase recruitment domain (CARD) domain through an IFN-stimulated response element. In addition, RIG-I activated other key genes in the ISGylation pathway by activating signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1), including the modifier ISG15 and several enzymes responsible for the conjugation of ISG15 to protein substrates. RIG-I cooperated with STAT1/2 and interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1) to promote the activation of the ISGylation pathway. The integrity of ISGylation in ATRA or RIG-I-induced cell differentiation was essential given that knockdown of TRIM25 or ISG15 resulted in significant inhibition of this process. Our results provide insight into the role of the RIG-I-TRIM25-ISGylation axis in myeloid differentiation.","['Wu, Song-Fang', 'Xia, Li', 'Shi, Xiao-Dong', 'Dai, Yu-Jun', 'Zhang, Wei-Na', 'Zhao, Jun-Mei', 'Zhang, Wu', 'Weng, Xiang-Qin', 'Lu, Jing', 'Le, Huang-Ying', 'Tao, Sheng-Ce', 'Zhu, Jiang', 'Chen, Zhu', 'Wang, Yue-Ying', 'Chen, Saijuan']","['Wu SF', 'Xia L', 'Shi XD', 'Dai YJ', 'Zhang WN', 'Zhao JM', 'Zhang W', 'Weng XQ', 'Lu J', 'Le HY', 'Tao SC', 'Zhu J', 'Chen Z', 'Wang YY', 'Chen S']","['State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, National Research Center for Translational Medicine at Shanghai, Rui Jin Hospital affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Systems Biomedicine (Ministry of Education), Shanghai Center for Systems Biomedicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai 200240, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, National Research Center for Translational Medicine at Shanghai, Rui Jin Hospital affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, National Research Center for Translational Medicine at Shanghai, Rui Jin Hospital affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, National Research Center for Translational Medicine at Shanghai, Rui Jin Hospital affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, National Research Center for Translational Medicine at Shanghai, Rui Jin Hospital affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, National Research Center for Translational Medicine at Shanghai, Rui Jin Hospital affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, National Research Center for Translational Medicine at Shanghai, Rui Jin Hospital affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, National Research Center for Translational Medicine at Shanghai, Rui Jin Hospital affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, National Research Center for Translational Medicine at Shanghai, Rui Jin Hospital affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Systems Biomedicine (Ministry of Education), Shanghai Center for Systems Biomedicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai 200240, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Systems Biomedicine (Ministry of Education), Shanghai Center for Systems Biomedicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai 200240, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, National Research Center for Translational Medicine at Shanghai, Rui Jin Hospital affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, National Research Center for Translational Medicine at Shanghai, Rui Jin Hospital affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, China;

Standard treatment for AML consists of induction chemotherapy with remission achieved in 50 to 75% of cases. Unfortunately, most patients will relapse and die from their disease, as 5-y survival is roughly 29%. Therefore, other treatment options are urgently needed. In recent years, immune-based therapies have led to unprecedented rates of survival among patients with some advanced cancers. Suppression of T cell function in the tumor microenvironment is commonly observed and may play a role in AML. We found that there is a significant association between T cell infiltration in the bone marrow microenvironment of newly diagnosed patients with AML and increased overall survival. Functional studies aimed at establishing the degree of T cell suppression in patients with AML revealed impaired T cell function in many patients. In most cases, T cell proliferation could be restored by blocking the immune checkpoint molecules PD-1, CTLA-4, or TIM3. Our data demonstrate that AML establishes an immune suppressive environment in the bone marrow, in part through T cell checkpoint function.","['Lamble, Adam J', 'Kosaka, Yoko', 'Laderas, Ted', 'Maffit, Allie', 'Kaempf, Andy', 'Brady, Lauren K', 'Wang, Weiwei', 'Long, Nicola', 'Saultz, Jennifer N', 'Mori, Motomi', 'Soong, David', 'LeFave, Clare V', 'Huang, Fei', 'Adams, Homer 3rd', 'Loriaux, Marc M', 'Tognon, Cristina E', 'Lo, Pierrette', 'Tyner, Jeffrey W', 'Fan, Guang', 'McWeeney, Shannon K', 'Druker, Brian J', 'Lind, Evan F']","['Lamble AJ', 'Kosaka Y', 'Laderas T', 'Maffit A', 'Kaempf A', 'Brady LK', 'Wang W', 'Long N', 'Saultz JN', 'Mori M', 'Soong D', 'LeFave CV', 'Huang F', 'Adams H 3rd', 'Loriaux MM', 'Tognon CE', 'Lo P', 'Tyner JW', 'Fan G', 'McWeeney SK', 'Druker BJ', 'Lind EF']","['Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR 97239.', 'Department of Molecular Microbiology & Immunology, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR 97239.', 'Division of Bioinformatics & Computational Biology, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR 97239.', 'Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR 97239.', 'Biostatistics Shared Resource, Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR 97239.', 'Janssen Pharmaceutical Research and Development, Spring House, PA 19477.', 'Clinical Laboratory, Xinhua Hospital, Shanghai Jiaotong University of Medicine School, 200025 Shanghai, China.', 'Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR 97239.', 'Center for Hematological Malignancies, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR 97239.', 'Biostatistics Shared Resource, Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR 97239.', 'Janssen Pharmaceutical Research and Development, Spring House, PA 19477.', 'LabConnect LLC, Seattle, WA 98104.', 'Janssen Pharmaceutical Research and Development, Spring House, PA 19477.', 'Janssen Pharmaceutical Research and Development, Spring House, PA 19477.', 'Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR 97239.', 'Center for Hematological Malignancies, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR 97239.', 'Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR 97239.', 'Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR 97239.', 'Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR 97239.', 'Department of Cell, Developmental & Cancer Biology, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR 97239.', 'Department of Pathology, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR 97239.', 'Division of Bioinformatics & Computational Biology, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR 97239.', 'Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR 97239.', 'Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR 97239;

In this study, we examine the progression of the spermatogenesis process after human spermatogonial stem cell (SSCs) transplantation in vivo and in tissue culture conditions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Human SSCs were obtained from a Testicular Sperm Extractions (TESE) sample, and characterization of these cells was confirmed by detecting the promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF) protein. These cells, after being labeled with Di-alkyl Indocarbocyanine (DiI), were transplanted to adult azoospermia mouse testes treated with Busulfan 40mg/kg. The host testicular tissue culture was then considered a test group and in vivo transplant a control group. After 8 weeks, immunohistochemical, morphometric and molecular studies were performed. RESULTS: The results of morphometric studies indicated that the mean number of spermatogonia, spermatocytes, and spermatids in the test groups was significantly lower than in the control group (P<0.05) and most of the cells responded positively to DiI tracing. Immunohistochemical study in both groups revealed expression of PLZF, Synaptonemal complex protein 3 (SCP3) and Acrosin Binding Protein (ACRBP) proteins in spermatogonial cells, spermatocyte and spermatozoa, respectively. Also, PLZF, Transition Protein 1 (TP1) and Tektin-1 (Tekt1) human-specific genes had a significant difference in the between test groups and control groups (P<0.05) in molecular studies. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the conditions of testicular tissue culture after transplantation of SSCs can support spermatogenesis resumption, as well as in an in vivo condition.","['Mohaqiq, Mahdi', 'Movahedin, Mansoureh', 'Mazaheri, Zohreh', 'Amirjannati, Naser']","['Mohaqiq M', 'Movahedin M', 'Mazaheri Z', 'Amirjannati N']","['Paraclinic Department, Medicine Faculty, Kateb University, Kabul, Afghanistan; Stem Cell Department, Medical Research Center, Kateb University, Kabul, Afghanistan.

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective Observational study. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: Paediatric Oncology Ward, Combined Military Hospital, Rawalpindi, from January 2012 to September 2019. METHODOLOGY: All registered cases of AML under 18 years of age, admitted to paediatric oncology ward in Combined Military Hospital, Rawalpindi, who had completed their treatment before 30th September 2019 were included. Their demographic and clinical data including WBC counts, immunophenotyping, cytogenetic abnormalities and impact of cytogenetics on disease outcome was assessed. Data was analysed for descriptive statistics and association of proportions. RESULTS: Data of 138 cases of de novo AML including 90 (65.2%) males and 48 (34.8%) females were analysed. The mean age was 6.37 +/-3.51 years. Initial WBC of more than 50x109/L was seen in 43 (31.2%) patients. The most common FAB subtype was M-2 in 74 (53.6%), followed by M-4 in 20 (14.5%) cases. The majority of cases 81 (58.7%) had normal cytogenetics followed by 42 (30.4%) favourable and 15 (10.8%) unfavourable abnormalities. Five-year overall survival was 82.4%, 56.5% and 55.6% for favourable, intermediate and unfavourable risk cytogenetics, respectively (p=0.039). Disease-free survival was 82.4%, 51.6% and 44.4% for favourable, intermediate and unfavourable risk cytogenetics (p=0.008). CONCLUSIONS: Identification of cytogenetic aberrations at diagnosis will help in risk stratification and predicting prognosis in AML. This will further assist in improving treatment strategies for different cytogenetic risk groups.

The risk of AML is highly related to age. In the context of population aging, a comprehensive report presenting epidemiological trends of AML is evaluable for policy-marker to allocate healthy resources. METHODS: This study was based on the Global Burden of Disease 2017 database. We analyzed the change trends of incidence rate, death rate, and disability-adjusted life year (DALY) rate by calculating the corresponding estimated annual percentage change (EAPC) values. Besides, we investigated the influence of social development degree on AML's epidemiological trends and potential risk factors for AML-related mortality. RESULTS: From 1990 to 2017, the incidence of AML gradually increased in the globe. Males and elder people had a higher possibility to develop AML. Developed countries tended to have higher age-standardized incidence rate and death rate than developing regions. Smoking, high body mass index, occupational exposure to benzene, and formaldehyde were the main risk factors for AML-related mortality. Notably, the contribution ratio of exposure to carcinogens was significantly increased in the low social-demographic index (SDI) region than in the high SDI region. CONCLUSION: Generally, the burden of AML became heavier during the past 28 years which might need more health resources to resolve this population aging-associated problem. In the present stage, developed countries with high SDI had the most AML incidences and deaths. At the same time, developing countries with middle- or low-middle SDI also need to take actions to relieve rapidly increased AML burden.","['Yi, Ming', 'Li, Anping', 'Zhou, Linghui', 'Chu, Qian', 'Song, Yongping', 'Wu, Kongming']","['Yi M', 'Li A', 'Zhou L', 'Chu Q', 'Song Y', 'Wu K']","['Department of Oncology, Tongji Hospital of Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430030, China.', 'The Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University & Henan Cancer Hospital, Zhengzhou, 450008, China.', ""Department of Oncology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, 710004, China."", 'Department of Oncology, Tongji Hospital of Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430030, China.', 'The Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University & Henan Cancer Hospital, Zhengzhou, 450008, China.', 'Department of Oncology, Tongji Hospital of Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430030, China. wukm_lab@163.com.', 'The Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University & Henan Cancer Hospital, Zhengzhou, 450008, China. wukm_lab@163.com.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200608,England,J Hematol Oncol,Journal of hematology & oncology,101468937,['0 (Carcinogens)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Distribution', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Carcinogens/toxicity', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Developed Countries', 'Developing Countries', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Female', 'Global Burden of Disease/*trends', 'Global Health/trends', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mortality/trends', 'Obesity/epidemiology', 'Population Dynamics', 'Quality-Adjusted Life Years', 'Resource Allocation', 'Risk Factors', 'Sex Distribution', 'Smoking/epidemiology', 'Social Determinants of Health', 'Young Adult']",PMC7282046,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myeloid leukemia', '*Cancer epidemiology', '*Cancer statistics', '*Global burden disease', '*Population aging']",2020/06/10 06:00,2021/05/18 06:00,['2020/06/10 06:00'],"['2020/05/06 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/06/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/18 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13045-020-00908-z [doi]', '10.1186/s13045-020-00908-z [pii]']",epublish,J Hematol Oncol. 2020 Jun 8;13(1):72. doi: 10.1186/s13045-020-00908-z.,['ORCID: 0000-0003-2499-1032'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nearly 50% of the patients who receive the most intensive treatment develop chemoresistant leukemia relapse. Although the leukemogenic events leading to relapse seem to differ between patients (i.e., regrowth from a clone detected at first diagnosis, progression from the original leukemic or preleukemic stem cells), a common characteristic of relapsed AML is increased chemoresistance. The aim of the present study was to investigate at the proteomic level whether leukemic cells from relapsed patients present overlapping molecular mechanisms that contribute to this chemoresistance. We used liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to compare the proteomic and phosphoproteomic profiles of AML cells derived from seven patients at the time of first diagnosis and at first relapse. At the time of first relapse, AML cells were characterized by increased levels of proteins important for various mitochondrial functions, such as mitochondrial ribosomal subunit proteins (MRPL21, MRPS37) and proteins for RNA processing (DHX37, RNA helicase; RPP40, ribonuclease P component), DNA repair (ERCC3, DNA repair factor IIH helicase; GTF2F1, general transcription factor), and cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) activity. The levels of several cytoskeletal proteins (MYH14/MYL6/MYL12A, myosin chains; VCL, vinculin) as well as of proteins involved in vesicular trafficking/secretion and cell adhesion (ITGAX, integrin alpha-X; CD36, platelet glycoprotein 4; SLC2A3, solute carrier family 2) were decreased in relapsed cells. Our study introduces new targetable proteins that might direct therapeutic strategies to decrease chemoresistance in relapsed AML.","['Aasebo, Elise', 'Berven, Frode S', 'Hovland, Randi', 'Doskeland, Stein Ove', 'Bruserud, Oystein', 'Selheim, Frode', 'Hernandez-Valladares, Maria']","['Aasebo E', 'Berven FS', 'Hovland R', 'Doskeland SO', 'Bruserud O', 'Selheim F', 'Hernandez-Valladares M']","['Department of Clinical Science, University of Bergen, 5021 Bergen, Norway.', 'The Department of Biomedicine, The Proteomics Unit at the University of Bergen (PROBE), University of Bergen, 5009 Bergen, Norway.', 'The Department of Biomedicine, The Proteomics Unit at the University of Bergen (PROBE), University of Bergen, 5009 Bergen, Norway.', 'The Department of Biomedicine, University of Bergen, 5009 Bergen, Norway.', 'Department for Medical Genetics, Haukeland University Hospital, 5021 Bergen, Norway.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, University of Bergen, 5006 Bergen, Norway.', 'The Department of Biomedicine, University of Bergen, 5009 Bergen, Norway.', 'Department of Clinical Science, University of Bergen, 5021 Bergen, Norway.', 'The Department of Biomedicine, The Proteomics Unit at the University of Bergen (PROBE), University of Bergen, 5009 Bergen, Norway.', 'The Department of Biomedicine, University of Bergen, 5009 Bergen, Norway.', 'Department of Clinical Science, University of Bergen, 5021 Bergen, Norway.', 'The Department of Biomedicine, The Proteomics Unit at the University of Bergen (PROBE), University of Bergen, 5009 Bergen, Norway.']",['eng'],['100933/Kreftforeningen'],['Journal Article'],20200604,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,,,PMC7352627,['NOTNLM'],"['CDK', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'degranulation', 'kinase', 'markers', 'mass spectrometry', 'minimal residual disease', 'mitochondria', 'patient relapse', 'phosphoproteome', 'proteome', 'secretion']",2020/06/10 06:00,2020/06/10 06:01,['2020/06/10 06:00'],"['2020/05/16 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/06/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/10 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers12061466 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers12061466 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2020 Jun 4;12(6). pii: cancers12061466. doi: 10.3390/cancers12061466.,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-6939-8059', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9347-7841']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After their generation in the bone marrow from hematopoietic stem cells, they maturate as granulocytes (neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils), monocytes, and lymphocytes. The abnormal accumulation and proliferation of immature blood cells (blasts) lead to severe and widespread diseases such as leukemia. We have recently shown that KCTD15, a member of the potassium channel tetramerization domain containing protein family (KCTD), is remarkably upregulated in leukemic B-cells. Here, we extend our investigation by monitoring the KCTD15 expression levels in circulating lymphocytes, monocytes, and granulocytes, as well as in leukemia cells. Significant differences in the expression level of KCTD15 were detected in normal lymphocytes, monocytes, and granulocytes. Interestingly, we also found overexpression of the protein following leukemic transformation in the case of myeloid cell lineage. Indeed, KCTD15 was found to be upregulated in K562 and NB4 cells, as well as in HL-60 cell lines. This in vitro finding was corroborated by the analysis of KCTD15 mRNA of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients reported in the Microarray Innovations in Leukemia (MILE) dataset.

Nowadays, these remarkable proteins are useful tools, not only in basic research, but also in clinical medicine. HIGHLIGHT: By taking advantage of fluorescent protein-based technologies, we identified a signaling network critical for influenza virus internalization and infection. In addition, we developed a highly sensitive biosensor for monitoring kinase activity that utilizes energy transfer between fluorescent proteins. This has led to a high-performance clinical test that enables the prediction of future therapeutic responses and the risk of acquired drug resistance for each individual patient before beginning molecular target therapy. CONCLUSION: Technologies that utilize fluorescent proteins, such as the biosensor presented here, should find increasing applications in clinical medicine.","['Ohba, Yusuke', 'Fujioka, Yoichiro']","['Ohba Y', 'Fujioka Y']","['Department of Cell Physiology, Hokkaido University Graduate School of Medicine, N15W7, Kita-ku, Sapporo 060-8638, Japan.

Distinguishing somatic from germline variants is of vital importance, in order to establish an appropriate individualized management and counsel the patients and their relatives. Since many of the genes associated with myeloid neoplasm germline predisposition (MNGP) are also affected in sporadic MN, we intended to design a strategy to identify potentially inherited variants in a tumor only NGS panel in a cohort of 299 patients with a variety of MN. We considered as indicative of potential inherited origin, variants detected in BM sample at a approximately 50% VAF classified as pathogenic, likely pathogenic or of unknown significance detected in MNGP-related genes. A total of 104 suspicious variants from 90 patients were filtered-in in tumor samples. Mutational patterns, follow-up data, and sequencing of a range of non-myeloid tissues were used for narrowing down the list of suspicious variants, and ultimately discriminate their nature. Our data supports the importance of considering variants found upon tumor-only sequencing as potentially of germline origin, and we offer a pipeline to define the nature of the variants.","['Aguilera-Diaz, Almudena', 'Larrayoz, Maria Jose', 'Palomino-Echeverria, Sara', 'Vazquez, Iria', 'Ariceta, Benat', 'Manu, Amagoia', 'Blasco-Iturri, Zurine', 'Bernal Del Castillo, Teresa', 'Olivares Salaverri, Matxalen', 'Olave Rubio, Maria Teresa', 'Rifon-Roca, Jose', 'Alfonso-Pierola, Ana', 'Prosper, Felipe', 'Fernandez-Mercado, Marta', 'Calasanz, Maria Jose']","['Aguilera-Diaz A', 'Larrayoz MJ', 'Palomino-Echeverria S', 'Vazquez I', 'Ariceta B', 'Manu A', 'Blasco-Iturri Z', 'Bernal Del Castillo T', 'Olivares Salaverri M', 'Olave Rubio MT', 'Rifon-Roca J', 'Alfonso-Pierola A', 'Prosper F', 'Fernandez-Mercado M', 'Calasanz MJ']","['Advanced Genomics Laboratory, Hemato-Oncology, Center for Applied Medical Research (CIMA), University of Navarra, Pamplona, Spain; Navarra Institute for Health Research (IdiSNA), Pamplona, Spain.', 'Navarra Institute for Health Research (IdiSNA), Pamplona, Spain; Hematological Diseases Laboratory, CIMA LAB Diagnostics, University of Navarra, Pamplona, Spain.', 'Hematological Diseases Laboratory, CIMA LAB Diagnostics, University of Navarra, Pamplona, Spain.', 'Navarra Institute for Health Research (IdiSNA), Pamplona, Spain; Hematological Diseases Laboratory, CIMA LAB Diagnostics, University of Navarra, Pamplona, Spain.', 'Hematological Diseases Laboratory, CIMA LAB Diagnostics, University of Navarra, Pamplona, Spain.', 'Hematological Diseases Laboratory, CIMA LAB Diagnostics, University of Navarra, Pamplona, Spain.', 'Hematological Diseases Laboratory, CIMA LAB Diagnostics, University of Navarra, Pamplona, Spain.', 'Hematology Department, Hospital Universitario Central de Asturias, Oviedo, Spain.', 'Hematology Department, Hospital Universitario de Galdakao, Galdakao, Spain.', 'Hematology Department, Hospital Clinico Universitario Lozano Blesa, Zaragoza, Spain.', 'Hematology Department, Clinica Universidad de Navarra (CUN), Pamplona, Spain.', 'Hematology Department, Clinica Universidad de Navarra (CUN), Pamplona, Spain.', 'Advanced Genomics Laboratory, Hemato-Oncology, Center for Applied Medical Research (CIMA), University of Navarra, Pamplona, Spain; Navarra Institute for Health Research (IdiSNA), Pamplona, Spain; Hematology Department, Clinica Universidad de Navarra (CUN), Pamplona, Spain.', 'Advanced Genomics Laboratory, Hemato-Oncology, Center for Applied Medical Research (CIMA), University of Navarra, Pamplona, Spain; Hematological Diseases Laboratory, CIMA LAB Diagnostics, University of Navarra, Pamplona, Spain.

This retrospective analysis of patients with PNH who underwent allo-HSCT in 11 Polish centers between 2002 and 2016 comprised 78 patients with PHN, including 27 with classic PNH (cPNH) and 51 with bone marrow failure-associated PNH (BMF/PNH). The cohort was 59% male, with a median age of 29 years (range, 12 to 65 years). There was a history of thrombosis in 12% and a history of hemolysis in 81%, and 92% required erythrocyte transfusions before undergoing allo-HSCT. No patient received eculizumab, and 26% received immunosuppressive treatment. The median time from diagnosis to allo-HSCT was 12 months (range, 1 to 127 months). Almost all patients (94%) received reduced-toxicity conditioning, 66% with treosulfan. The stem cell source was peripheral blood in 72% and an identical sibling donor in 24%. Engraftment occurred in 96% of the patients. With a median follow-up of 5.1 years in patients with cPNH and 3.2 years in patients with BMF/PNH, 3-year overall survival (OS) was 88.9% in the former and 85.1% in the latter (P = not significant [NS]). The 3-year OS for patients with/without thrombosis was 50%/92% (P = NS) in the cPNH group and 83.3%/85.3% (P = NS) in the BMF/PNH group. The 3-year OS for in the BMF/PNH patients with/without hemolysis was 93.9%/62.9% (hazard ratio, .13; P = .016). No other factors impacted OS. After allo-HSCT, the frequency of the PNH clone was reduced to 0%, <1%, and <2.4% in 48%, 48%, and 4% of cPNH patients and in 84%, 11%, and 5% of BMF/PNH patients, respectively. The frequency of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) grade II-IV was 23%, and the cumulative 1-year incidence of extensive chronic GVHD was 10.8% in the BMF/PNH group and 3.7% in the cPNH group. Allo-HSCT is a valid option for PNH patients, effectively eliminating the PNH clone with satisfactory overall survival and acceptable toxicity. Reduced-toxicity conditioning with treosulfan is effective and safe in patients with cPNH and BMF/PNH.","['Markiewicz, Miroslaw', 'Drozd-Sokolowska, Joanna', 'Biecek, Przemyslaw', 'Dzierzak-Mietla, Monika', 'Boguradzki, Piotr', 'Staniak, Mateusz', 'Piatkowska-Jakubas, Beata', 'Piekarska, Agnieszka', 'Tormanowska, Magdalena', 'Halaburda, Kazimierz', 'Ussowicz, Marek', 'Waszczuk-Gajda, Anna', 'Basak, Grzegorz', 'Bolkun, Lukasz', 'Rybka, Justyna', 'Sadus-Wojciechowska, Maria', 'Giebel, Sebastian', 'Szmigielska-Kaplon, Anna', 'Mendek-Czajkowska, Ewa', 'Warzybok, Katarzyna', 'Burdacki, Adrian', 'Dwilewicz-Trojaczek, Jadwiga']","['Markiewicz M', 'Drozd-Sokolowska J', 'Biecek P', 'Dzierzak-Mietla M', 'Boguradzki P', 'Staniak M', 'Piatkowska-Jakubas B', 'Piekarska A', 'Tormanowska M', 'Halaburda K', 'Ussowicz M', 'Waszczuk-Gajda A', 'Basak G', 'Bolkun L', 'Rybka J', 'Sadus-Wojciechowska M', 'Giebel S', 'Szmigielska-Kaplon A', 'Mendek-Czajkowska E', 'Warzybok K', 'Burdacki A', 'Dwilewicz-Trojaczek J']","['Department of Hematology, Institute of Medical Sciences, Medical College of Rzeszow University, Rzeszow, Poland; Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, SPSK-M Hospital, Katowice, Poland.

This study aimed to evaluate the recombinant production rate of active hLIF by different vector-host systems under various conditions. Moreover, a rabbit polyclonal antibody (pAb) against recombinant hLIF (rhLIF) was produced and its anti-fertility effects were explored in Balb/c mice. Four different constructs including pET22b/hLIF, pET28b/hLIF, pET32b/hLIF and pColdI/hLIF were designed and transformed into BL21-(DE3), Rosetta-(DE3), Origami-(DE3) and Shuffle T7-(DE3) host cells. The expression level and proliferative effect of rhLIF were measured by SDS-PAGE and MTT assays, respectively. Rabbit pAb to rhLIF was produced and characterized using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and western blot techniques. The Balb/c mice were divided into two intervention and control groups. Then, they were intraperitoneally injected by purified rabbit anti-rhLIF and non-immunized rabbit pAb, respectively. After sacrifice on day 7, the number of implantation sites was counted. The rhLIF was successfully expressed by pET32b/hLIF and pColdI/hLIF vectors in all hosts with no significant difference in the rate of their expression. The rhLIF was purified and checked for activity. The results showed that it is functionally active and the produced anti-rhLIF pAb could specifically bind to commercial rhLIF. Passive immunization results showed that anti-rhLIF antibody completely inhibited fertility in all injected Balb/c mice compared to controls. Although previous studies showed expression of rhLIF using various methods, using different vector-host systems ensures us of successful biological active expression of it.

While these kinases belong to separate signal transduction cascades, they demonstrate an uncanny propensity to regulate many of the same proteins either through direct phosphorylation or by altering transcription/translation, including: c-MYC, NF-kappaB, p53 and TAU, as well as each another. A significant number of studies centered on the GSK3 kinases have led to the identification of the GSK3 interactome and a number of substrates, which link GSK3 activity to metabolic control, translation, RNA splicing, ribosome biogenesis, cellular division, DNA repair and stress/inflammatory signaling. Interestingly, many of these same pathways and processes are controlled by PKR, but unlike the GSK3 kinases, a clear picture of proteins interacting with PKR and a complete listing of its substrates is still missing. In this review, we take a detailed look at what is known about the PKR and GSK3 kinases, how these kinases interact to influence common cellular processes (innate immunity, alternative splicing, translation, glucose metabolism) and how aberrant activation of these kinases leads to diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), diabetes mellitus (DM) and cancer.","['Piazzi, Manuela', 'Bavelloni, Alberto', 'Faenza, Irene', 'Blalock, William']","['Piazzi M', 'Bavelloni A', 'Faenza I', 'Blalock W']","['Istituto di Genetica Molecolare ""Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza"", Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (IGM-CNR), Bologna, Italy; IRCCS, Istituto Ortopedico Rizzoli, Bologna, Italy.', 'Laboratoria di Oncologia Sperimentale, IRCCS, Istituto Ortopedico Rizzoli, Bologna, Italy.', 'Dipartimento di Scienze Biomediche e Neuromotorie, Universita di Bologna, Bologna, Italy.', 'Istituto di Genetica Molecolare ""Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza"", Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (IGM-CNR), Bologna, Italy; IRCCS, Istituto Ortopedico Rizzoli, Bologna, Italy.

Although TXNIP is epigenetically silenced in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells, as in many cancer cells, its role in leukemogenesis remains elusive. Mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL) gene rearrangements in AML are associated with poor prognosis, and the development of a new treatment method is eagerly anticipated. In this study, we first reveal that lower expression of TXNIP is correlated with shortened overall survival periods in AML patients. Moreover, we demonstrated that TXNIP overexpression significantly suppresses proliferation in AML cells harboring MLL fusion genes. TXNIP promotes autophagy by increasing expression of the autophagy protein, Beclin 1, and lipidation of LC3B. We also show that TXNIP overexpression combined with ABT263, a potent inhibitor of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, is highly effective at inducing cell death in MLL-rearranged (MLL-r) AML cells. In summary, this study provides insights into the molecular mechanism of TXNIP-mediated tumor suppression and furthermore underscores the potential of TXNIP as a promising therapeutic target for MLL-r AML.","['Noura, Mina', 'Matsuo, Hidemasa', 'Koyama, Asami', 'Adachi, Souichi', 'Masutani, Hiroshi']","['Noura M', 'Matsuo H', 'Koyama A', 'Adachi S', 'Masutani H']","['Department of Human Health Sciences, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory Sciences, Tenri Health Care University, Tenri, Japan.', 'Department of Human Health Sciences, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Human Health Sciences, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Human Health Sciences, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory Sciences, Tenri Health Care University, Tenri, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200624,England,FEBS Open Bio,FEBS open bio,101580716,"['0 (Aniline Compounds)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0 (TXNIP protein, human)', 'XKJ5VVK2WD (navitoclax)']",IM,"['Aniline Compounds/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Sulfonamides/pharmacology']",PMC7396447,['NOTNLM'],"['*AML', '*MLL', '*TXNIP', '*autophagy']",2020/06/09 06:00,2021/11/05 06:00,['2020/06/09 06:00'],"['2020/02/24 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/26 00:00 [revised]', '2020/06/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/05 06:00 [medline]', '2020/06/09 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/2211-5463.12908 [doi]'],ppublish,FEBS Open Bio. 2020 Aug;10(8):1532-1541. doi: 10.1002/2211-5463.12908.

OBJECTIVES: To propose the predictive markers of such bleeding, as well as mechanisms responsible for decreased bleeding at later therapy stages. PATIENTS/METHODS: We investigate platelet functional activity in 50 CLL and 16 MCL patients on ibrutinib using flow cytometry and light transmission aggregometry. RESULTS: Prior to treatment, both patient groups had decreased platelet counts; impaired aggregation with adenosine diphosphate (ADP); and decreased binding of CD62P, PAC1, and annexin V upon stimulation. Bleeding in patients treated with ibrutinib was observed in 28 (56%) CLL patients, who had decreased aggregation with ADP and platelet count before therapy. Their platelet count on therapy did not change, platelet aggregation with ADP steadily improved, and aggregation with collagen first decreased and then increased in anticorrellation with bleeding. Bleeding in MCL was observed in 10 (62%) patients, who had decreased dense granule release before therapy. ADP and ristocetin induced platelet aggregation in ibrutinib-treated MCL patients increased on therapy, while collagen-induced aggregation evolved similarly to CLL patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that ibrutinib-dependent bleeding in CLL patients involves three mechanisms: decreased platelet count (the most important discriminator between bleeding and non-bleeding patients), impaired platelet response to ADP caused by CLL, and inhibition by ibrutinib. Initially, ibrutinib shifts the balance to bleeding, but then it is restored because of the improved response to ADP.","['Dmitrieva, Elena A', 'Nikitin, Eugene A', 'Ignatova, Anastasia A', 'Vorobyev, Vladimir I', 'Poletaev, Aleksandr V', 'Seregina, Elena A', 'Voronin, Kirill A', 'Polokhov, Dmitry M', 'Maschan, Aleksey A', 'Novichkova, Galina A', 'Panteleev, Mikhail A', 'Ptushkin, Vadim V']","['Dmitrieva EA', 'Nikitin EA', 'Ignatova AA', 'Vorobyev VI', 'Poletaev AV', 'Seregina EA', 'Voronin KA', 'Polokhov DM', 'Maschan AA', 'Novichkova GA', 'Panteleev MA', 'Ptushkin VV']","['City Clinical Hospital named after S.P.

This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of administration of ferric carboxymaltose without erythropoiesis-stimulating agents for treating anemia in cancer patients. Moreover, we identified the biomarkers of hemoglobin response to predict the need for iron therapy. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We enrolled patients with solid cancers who were treated at a single institute (Samsung Medical Center, South Korea), from April 2015 to July 2017, in this prospective single-arm Phase II clinical trial. Patients received intravenous ferric carboxymaltose (1,000 mg) infusion on the first day (visit 1) of treatment. The primary end point was the number of hemoglobin responders, defined as patients with an increase in hemoglobin level >/= 1.0 g/dL from the baseline, a hemoglobin level >/= 11.0 g/dL, or both, within an 8-week observation period (week 3, 6, or 8). Secondary end points included changes in transferrin saturation and levels of soluble transferrin receptors, hepcidin, erythropoietin, interleukin-6, and C-reactive protein (CRP) at each visit. Of the 103 recruited patients, 92 were eligible for analysis. The mean patient age was 57.3 +/- 12.5 years, and 54.3% of the patients were women. The most common diagnoses were breast cancer (n = 23, 25.1%), lung cancer (n = 21, 22.9%), gastrointestinal cancer (n = 20, 20.9%), and lymphoma (n = 16, 17.7%). A hemoglobin response was observed in 36 (39.1%), 53 (57.6%), and 61 (66.3%) patients in the third, fifth, and eighth weeks, respectively. The mean increase in hemoglobin levels from the baseline to the end of treatment was 1.77 +/- 1.30 g/dL. Baseline values of hepcidin (p = 0.008), total iron binding capacity (p = 0.014), ferritin (p = 0.048), and CRP (p = 0.044) were significantly different between the responder and nonresponder groups. Multiple logistic regression analysis for baseline anemia-related biochemical variable significantly associated with the hemoglobin response showed that only baseline hepcidin level was a significant factor for hemoglobin response (odds ratio = 0.95, 95% confidence interval 0.90-1.0, p = 0.045). Hemoglobin responders had significantly lower hepcidin levels than nonresponders (mean [+/-standard deviation], 13.45 [+/-14.71] versus 35.22 [+/-40.470 ng/ml]; p = 0.007). However, our analysis had some limitations such as the different patient characteristics in the studies that were included, institutional differences in the measurement of hepcidin level, and missing data on long-term safety. Therefore, our findings need further validation. CONCLUSIONS: Intravenous ferric carboxymaltose (1,000 mg) monotherapy increases hemoglobin levels without serious adverse events in patients with cancer. Hepcidin is a useful biomarker for predicting iron requirement in cancer patients.

Such an effect could decrease prediction accuracy and treatment efficacy. We performed a methylation-age interaction analysis using 1,230 early-stage lung adenocarcinoma patients from five cohorts. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to investigate lung adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma patients for methylation-age interactions, which were further confirmed in a validation phase. We identified one adenocarcinoma-specific CpG probe, cg14326354PRODH, with effects significantly modified by age (HRinteraction = 0.989; 95% CI: 0.986-0.994; P = 9.18x10-7). The effect of low methylation was reversed for young and elderly patients categorized by the boundary of 95% CI standard (HRyoung = 2.44; 95% CI: 1.26-4.72; P = 8.34x10-3; HRelderly = 0.58; 95% CI: 0.42-0.82; P = 1.67x10-3). Moreover, there was an antagonistic interaction between low cg14326354PRODH methylation and elderly age (HRinteraction = 0.21; 95% CI: 0.11-0.40; P = 2.20x10-6). In summary, low methylation of cg14326354PRODH might benefit survival of elderly lung adenocarcinoma patients, providing new insight to age-specific prediction and potential drug targeting.","['Chen, Chao', 'Wei, Yongyue', 'Wei, Liangmin', 'Chen, Jiajin', 'Chen, Xin', 'Dong, Xuesi', 'He, Jieyu', 'Lin, Lijuan', 'Zhu, Ying', 'Huang, Hui', 'You, Dongfang', 'Lai, Linjing', 'Shen, Sipeng', 'Duan, Weiwei', 'Su, Li', 'Shafer, Andrea', 'Fleischer, Thomas', 'Bjaanaes, Maria Moksnes', 'Karlsson, Anna', 'Planck, Maria', 'Wang, Rui', 'Staaf, Johan', 'Helland, Aslaug', 'Esteller, Manel', 'Zhang, Ruyang', 'Chen, Feng', 'Christiani, David C']","['Chen C', 'Wei Y', 'Wei L', 'Chen J', 'Chen X', 'Dong X', 'He J', 'Lin L', 'Zhu Y', 'Huang H', 'You D', 'Lai L', 'Shen S', 'Duan W', 'Su L', 'Shafer A', 'Fleischer T', 'Bjaanaes MM', 'Karlsson A', 'Planck M', 'Wang R', 'Staaf J', 'Helland A', 'Esteller M', 'Zhang R', 'Chen F', 'Christiani DC']","['Department of Biostatistics, Center for Global Health, School of Public Health, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing 211166, Jiangsu, China.', 'China International Cooperation Center for Environment and Human Health, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing 211166, Jiangsu, China.', 'Department of Biostatistics, Center for Global Health, School of Public Health, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing 211166, Jiangsu, China.', 'China International Cooperation Center for Environment and Human Health, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing 211166, Jiangsu, China.', 'Department of Environmental Health, Harvard T.H.

We highlight the key issues in diagnosis and treatment and focus on emerging technologies, current options among consolidation strategies, and biological agents. We anticipate that further development of molecular diagnostics and molecular imaging approaches that elucidate minimal residual disease in brain parenchyma, leptomeninges, intraocular compartments and even bone marrow will greatly impact the delivery and timing of cytotoxic and biological therapies. Implementation of these approaches is likely essential to clarify ongoing discrepancies in the interpretation of clinical trial results that currently are based on relatively unrefined definitions of response. While the results of early phase investigations involving ibrutinib and the IMiD agents, lenalidomide, pomalidomide, as well as avadomide, strongly support the hypothesis that the B-cell receptor (BCR) pathway, involving MYD88 and CD79B and NF-kB activation, is critical to the pathogenesis of PCNSL, much work is needed to elucidate mechanisms of resistance. Similarly, development of strategies to overcome immunosuppressive mechanisms that are upregulated in the tumor microenvironment is a high priority. Finally, ongoing evidence supports the hypothesis that the blood-brain barrier represents a significant impediment to efficient brain tumor penetration of novel therapeutic agents and innovative strategies of drug delivery remain essential to further improve outcomes.","['Tsang, Mazie', 'Cleveland, Joseph', 'Rubenstein, James L']","['Tsang M', 'Cleveland J', 'Rubenstein JL']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of California, San Francisco, California, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, California, USA.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of California, San Francisco, California, USA.', 'Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of California, San Francisco, California, USA.']",['eng'],"['T32 AG000212/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA239462/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA139-83-01A1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'Translational Research Program/Leukemia and Lymphoma Society']","['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200703,England,Hematol Oncol,Hematological oncology,8307268,,IM,"['Animals', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms/*diagnosis/etiology/*therapy', 'Combined Modality Therapy/adverse effects/methods', 'Disease Management', 'Disease Susceptibility', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma/*diagnosis/etiology/*therapy', 'Molecular Diagnostic Techniques', 'Multimodal Imaging/methods', 'Symptom Assessment', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tumor Microenvironment']",,['NOTNLM'],"['NFkB', 'high dose chemotherapy', 'immunotherapy', 'minimal residual disease', 'primary CNS lymphoma']",2020/06/09 06:00,2021/01/12 06:00,['2020/06/09 06:00'],"['2020/05/09 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/01 00:00 [revised]', '2020/06/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/12 06:00 [medline]', '2020/06/09 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/hon.2761 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematol Oncol. 2020 Dec;38(5):640-647. doi: 10.1002/hon.2761.

Given the prognostic importance of measurable residual disease (MRD), CETLAM-12 considered a pre-emptive intervention in patients with molecular failure (MF). We analyzed 110 ELNfav NPM1 AML patients achieving complete remission (CR) after induction chemotherapy. Two-year cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR), overall survival (OS) and leukaemia-free survival (LFS) were 17%, 81.5% and 82%, respectively. Forty-six patients required additional therapy for MF (n = 33) or haematological relapse (HemR; n = 13), resulting in a molecular LFS (molLFS) and a cumulative incidence of MF at two years of 61% and 38% respectively. Two-year OS for these 46 patients was 66%, with a different outcome between patients with MF (86%) and HemR (42%) (P = 0.002). Quantitative NPM1 detection at different timepoints was predictive of molLFS; an MRD ratio (NPM1mut/ABL1 x 100) cut-off of 0.05 after first consolidation identified two cohorts with a two-year molLFS of 77% and 40% for patients below and above 0.05, respectively.

Most childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) survivors develop chronic treatment-related adverse effects several years after the end of the treatment. Regular physical activity and a good cardiorespiratory fitness can decrease the risks of neurological disturbances and increase cognitive function scores. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of good cardiorespiratory fitness and physical activity levels on cognitive functions.Methods. We enrolled 219 survivors of childhood ALL. The participants underwent a cardiopulmonary exercise test, neuropsychological tests of executive functions (i.e. verbal fluency, cognitive flexibility, working memory, processing speed) and completed a physical activity questionnaire. We calculated the odds ratio to obtain the preventive fraction of physical activity and cardiorespiratory fitness levels on cognitive functions.Results. The cohort is 52% male and 48% female. A total of 182 survivors (83%) have a cardiorespiratory fitness below their predicted (<100%). Our analyses show that there is an association between good cardiorespiratory fitness and processing speed (preventive fraction of 70% for dominant hand (p < 0.01) and 65% for non-dominant hand (p < 0.01)) and with cognitive flexibility identified as the category switching measure of the D-KEFS verbal fluency (preventive fraction of 61%; p < 0.05).Conclusion. Good cardiorespiratory fitness and good levels of physical activity were associated to a preventive fraction for most cognitive function parameters measured. Good cardiorespiratory fitness levels were significantly associated with a lower prevalence of deficits in processing speed (i.e., dominant hand and non-dominant hand) and in cognitive flexibility (i.e., category switching) in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia survivors.","['Gendron, Elisabelle', 'Caru, Maxime', 'Leveille, Pauline', 'Sultan, Serge', 'Robaey, Philippe', 'Lemay, Valerie', 'Drouin, Simon', 'Bertout, Laurence', 'Andelfinger, Gregor', 'Krajinovic, Maja', 'Laverdiere, Caroline', 'Sinnett, Daniel', 'Lippe, Sarah', 'Curnier, Daniel']","['Gendron E', 'Caru M', 'Leveille P', 'Sultan S', 'Robaey P', 'Lemay V', 'Drouin S', 'Bertout L', 'Andelfinger G', 'Krajinovic M', 'Laverdiere C', 'Sinnett D', 'Lippe S', 'Curnier D']","['Laboratory of Pathophysiology of EXercise (LPEX), School of Kinesiology and Physical Activity Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, University of Montreal, Montreal, Canada.', 'Research Center, Sainte-Justine University Health Center, Montreal, Canada.', 'Laboratory of Pathophysiology of EXercise (LPEX), School of Kinesiology and Physical Activity Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, University of Montreal, Montreal, Canada.', 'Research Center, Sainte-Justine University Health Center, Montreal, Canada.', 'Laboratoire EA 4430 - Clinique Psychanalyse Developpement (CliPsyD), Department of psychology, University of Paris Nanterre, Nanterre, France.', 'Research Center, Sainte-Justine University Health Center, Montreal, Canada.', 'Research Center, Sainte-Justine University Health Center, Montreal, Canada.', 'Department of Psychology, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Canada.', 'Research Center, Sainte-Justine University Health Center, Montreal, Canada.', 'Laboratory of Pathophysiology of EXercise (LPEX), School of Kinesiology and Physical Activity Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, University of Montreal, Montreal, Canada.', 'Research Center, Sainte-Justine University Health Center, Montreal, Canada.', 'Research Center, Sainte-Justine University Health Center, Montreal, Canada.', 'Research Center, Sainte-Justine University Health Center, Montreal, Canada.', 'Research Center, Sainte-Justine University Health Center, Montreal, Canada.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Montreal, Montreal, Canada.', 'Research Center, Sainte-Justine University Health Center, Montreal, Canada.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Montreal, Montreal, Canada.', 'Research Center, Sainte-Justine University Health Center, Montreal, Canada.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Montreal, Montreal, Canada.', 'Research Center, Sainte-Justine University Health Center, Montreal, Canada.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Montreal, Montreal, Canada.', 'Research Center, Sainte-Justine University Health Center, Montreal, Canada.', 'Department of Psychology, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Canada.', 'Laboratory of Pathophysiology of EXercise (LPEX), School of Kinesiology and Physical Activity Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, University of Montreal, Montreal, Canada.', 'Research Center, Sainte-Justine University Health Center, Montreal, Canada.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200608,England,Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Pediatric hematology and oncology,8700164,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Cancer Survivors', '*Cardiorespiratory Fitness', 'Child', '*Cognition', '*Exercise', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Odds Ratio', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/epidemiology/*physiopathology', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Young Adult']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'cardiorespiratory fitness', 'cognitive function', 'physical activity', 'preventive fraction']",2020/06/09 06:00,2021/01/27 06:00,['2020/06/09 06:00'],"['2020/06/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/27 06:00 [medline]', '2020/06/09 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/08880018.2020.1767737 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2020 Oct;37(7):582-598. doi: 10.1080/08880018.2020.1767737.

Transplantation of neural stem cells (NSCs) is a potential therapy for CNS injuries due to their pluripotency and differentiation abilities. Cytokines play an important role in CNS development and repair of CNS injuries. However, the detailed cytokine signaling response in monkey neural stem cells is rarely studied. In our previous research, we isolated NSCs from the adult monkey brain and found the effects of cytokines on monkey NSCs. Now, we further analyzed the regulation mechanisms of cytokines to the proliferation of monkey NSCs such as bone morphogenic protein 4 (BMP4), BMP4/leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF), or retinoic acid (RA)/Forskolin. The data showed that BMP4 inhibited cell proliferation to arrest, but it did not affect the stemness of NSCs. BMP4/LIF promoted the astrocyte-like differentiation of monkey NSCs, and RA/forskolin induced the neuronal differentiation of monkey NSCs. BMP4/LIF and RA/forskolin induced monkey NSC differentiation by regulating Notch signaling. These results provide some theoretical evidence for NSC therapy to brain or spinal cord injury in regenerative medicine.","['Wang, Min', 'Yu, Liming', 'Zhu, Lu-Ying', 'He, Hua', 'Ren, Jie', 'Pan, Jie', 'Xie, Xiaoyun', 'Cai, Chunhui', 'Lu, Lixia', 'Tian, Haibin', 'Chen, Li', 'Zhang, Ying', 'Liu, Yuehua', 'Zhang, Ce', 'Gao, Zhengliang', 'Han, Xin-Xin']","['Wang M', 'Yu L', 'Zhu LY', 'He H', 'Ren J', 'Pan J', 'Xie X', 'Cai C', 'Lu L', 'Tian H', 'Chen L', 'Zhang Y', 'Liu Y', 'Zhang C', 'Gao Z', 'Han XX']","['National Key Disciplines, Key Laboratory for Cellular Physiology of Ministry of Education, Department of Neurobiology, Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan 030001, China.', 'College of Medicine, Jiaxing University, Jiaxing 314001, China.', 'Oral Biomedical Engineering Laboratory, Shanghai Stomatological Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai 200001, China.', 'Oral Biomedical Engineering Laboratory, Shanghai Stomatological Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai 200001, China.', 'Oral Biomedical Engineering Laboratory, Shanghai Stomatological Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai 200001, China.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, Third Affiliated Hospital of Second Military Medical University, Shanghai 200438, China.', ""Shanghai Tenth People's Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Tongji University Advanced Institute of Translational Medicine, Shanghai 200092, China."", 'Oral Biomedical Engineering Laboratory, Shanghai Stomatological Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai 200001, China.', 'College of Medicine, Jiaxing University, Jiaxing 314001, China.', ""Shanghai Tenth People's Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Tongji University Advanced Institute of Translational Medicine, Shanghai 200092, China."", ""Shanghai Tenth People's Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Tongji University Advanced Institute of Translational Medicine, Shanghai 200092, China."", ""Shanghai Tenth People's Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Tongji University Advanced Institute of Translational Medicine, Shanghai 200092, China."", 'Oral Biomedical Engineering Laboratory, Shanghai Stomatological Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai 200001, China.', 'Oral Biomedical Engineering Laboratory, Shanghai Stomatological Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai 200001, China.', 'Oral Biomedical Engineering Laboratory, Shanghai Stomatological Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai 200001, China.', 'National Key Disciplines, Key Laboratory for Cellular Physiology of Ministry of Education, Department of Neurobiology, Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan 030001, China.', ""Shanghai Tenth People's Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine and Lifeng Institute of Regenerative Medicine, Tongji University, Shanghai 200092, China."", 'Oral Biomedical Engineering Laboratory, Shanghai Stomatological Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai 200001, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200513,United States,Biomed Res Int,BioMed research international,101600173,"['0 (Bone Morphogenetic Protein 4)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Receptors, Notch)', '1F7A44V6OU (Colforsin)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Morphogenetic Protein 4/pharmacology', 'Brain/cytology', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Colforsin/pharmacology', 'Cytokines/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/pharmacology', 'Macaca fascicularis', 'Male', 'Neural Stem Cells/*drug effects', 'Neurogenesis/*drug effects', 'Receptors, Notch/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology']",PMC7244951,,,2020/06/09 06:00,2021/03/26 06:00,['2020/06/09 06:00'],"['2019/09/05 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/01 00:00 [revised]', '2020/01/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/06/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1155/2020/1308526 [doi]'],epublish,Biomed Res Int. 2020 May 13;2020:1308526. doi: 10.1155/2020/1308526. eCollection 2020.,"['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0997-4982', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6737-0207', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0268-4656', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3557-0965', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3033-8873', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4445-9572', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5788-4095', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7870-250X']","['Ce Zhang, Zhengliang Gao, and Xin-Xin Han are senior authors.

There are two main stages in this process: the first stage occurs in the head mesoderm during the embryonic stage, and the second occurs in a specialized hematopoietic organ along the dorsal vessel, the lymph gland, during the larval stage. The lymph gland consists of paired lobes, each of which has distinct regions: the cortical zone (CZ), which contains mature hemocytes; the medullary zone (MZ), which contains hematopoietic progenitors; and the posterior signaling center (PSC), which specifically expresses the early B-cell factor (EBF) transcription factor Collier (Col) and the HOX factor Antennapedia (Antp) to form a microenvironment similar to that of the mammalian bone marrow hematopoietic stem cell niche. The PSC plays a key role in regulating hematopoietic progenitor differentiation. Moreover, the PSC contributes to the cellular immune response to wasp parasitism triggered by elevated ROS levels. Two recent studies have revealed that hematopoietic progenitor maintenance is directly regulated by Col expressed in the MZ and is independent of the PSC, challenging the traditional model. In this review, we summarize the regulatory networks of PSC cell proliferation, the controversy regarding PSC-mediated regulation of hematopoietic progenitor differentiation, and the wasp egg infection response. In addition, we discuss why the PSC is an ideal model for investigating mammalian hematopoietic stem cell niches and leukemia.","['Luo, Fangzhou', 'Yu, Shichao', 'Jin, Li Hua']","['Luo F', 'Yu S', 'Jin LH']","['Department of Genetics, College of Life Sciences, Northeast Forestry University, Harbin, China.', 'Department of Genetics, College of Life Sciences, Northeast Forestry University, Harbin, China.', 'Department of Genetics, College of Life Sciences, Northeast Forestry University, Harbin, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200521,Switzerland,Front Cell Dev Biol,Frontiers in cell and developmental biology,101630250,,,,PMC7253591,['NOTNLM'],"['Drosophila', 'differentiation', 'hematopoietic stem cells niche', 'immune response', 'leukemia', 'lymph gland', 'posterior signaling center', 'signaling network']",2020/06/09 06:00,2020/06/09 06:01,['2020/06/09 06:00'],"['2020/02/19 00:00 [received]', '2020/04/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/06/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/09 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fcell.2020.00382 [doi]'],epublish,Front Cell Dev Biol. 2020 May 21;8:382. doi: 10.3389/fcell.2020.00382. eCollection 2020.,,,"['Copyright (c) 2020 Luo, Yu and Jin.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Owing to the adverse prognosis associated with an unmutated immunoglobulin heavy chain variable (IGHV) status, SHM testing is performed as a standard of care in CLL. Conventionally, SHM testing has been performed using labor intensive and primarily analog Sanger sequencing method following PCR amplification of the clonal immunoglobulin heavy chain gene rearrangements in CLL cells. In comparison, recent availability of next generation sequencing (NGS) allows more versatile detection and direct identification of clonal immunoglobulin gene rearrangements in neoplastic B-cell populations. The ability to identify specific clonal IGHV signature(s) in both baseline (diagnostic) and post-treatment settings enables unique clinical applications of NGS such as determination of SHM status, minimal residual disease (MRD) monitoring, clonal heterogeneity and B cell receptor IG stereotypy. We provide a review of current practices and recommendations for SHM determination using NGS including examples of difficult cases.","['Gupta, Sanjeev Kumar', 'Viswanatha, David S', 'Patel, Keyur P']","['Gupta SK', 'Viswanatha DS', 'Patel KP']","['Laboratory Oncology Unit, Dr. B.R.A IRCH, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, New Delhi, India.', 'Division of Hematopathology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, United States.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, United States.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200519,Switzerland,Front Cell Dev Biol,Frontiers in cell and developmental biology,101630250,,,,PMC7248390,['NOTNLM'],"['CLL', 'NGS', 'clonality', 'immunoglobulin heavy chain', 'somatic hypermutation']",2020/06/09 06:00,2020/06/09 06:01,['2020/06/09 06:00'],"['2020/02/12 00:00 [received]', '2020/04/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/06/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/09 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fcell.2020.00357 [doi]'],epublish,Front Cell Dev Biol. 2020 May 19;8:357. doi: 10.3389/fcell.2020.00357. eCollection 2020.,,,"['Copyright (c) 2020 Gupta, Viswanatha and Patel.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cellulitis is mainly a clinical diagnosis but blood counts and ESR can be done to confirm its occurrence. Risk factors for cellulitis include breaks in the skin which allows an entry point for the bacteria, other risk factors include immune deficient states such as HIV/leukemia, conditions that affect the vascular system, and skin conditions such as eczema and psoriasis. Vaccination is an extremely rare cause of cellulitis with no cases of cellulitis reported since 1998 due to complication of vaccination.

However, the molecular mechanism controlling the transformation of androgen-dependent PCa (ADPC) to castration-resistant PCa (CRPC) is largely unknown. Androgen receptor (AR) signaling has been reported to play a key role in this process; thus, searching for the novel AR co-activator is important for identifying the mechanism underlying PCa progression. In this study, we focused on the function of mixed lineage leukemia-5alpha (MLL5alpha), an epigenetic regulator that exhibits aberrant expression in PCa. MLL5alpha was the primary expressed form of MLL5 protein in PCa cells and it significantly suppressed proliferation, invasion, and migration in PCa cell lines. Upon stimulation with dihydrotestosterone (DHT), knockdown of MLL5alpha significantly suppressed N-myc downstream regulated gene 1 (NDRG1) and Kallikrein-related peptidase 3 (KLK3) expression. MLL5alpha directly bound with AR on the androgen response elements (AREs) and recruited H3K4me3 to the promoters of NDRG1 and KLK3. Downregulation of NDRG1 partially restored the cell invasion and migration suppressed by MLL5alpha. As evaluated by the proliferation of PCa cells, overexpression of MLL5alpha synergistically promoted sensitivity to enzalutamide (ENZ) treatment. In PCa patients, MLL5alpha expression was lower in the high Gleason score (GS) (GS > 7) group than in the low GS (GS < 7) group. In conclusion, suppression of AR/NDRG1 signaling via androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) may be a potential mechanism of CRPC progression. MLL5alpha significantly suppressed PCa progression by promoting AR/NDRG1 signaling, indicating that regulating MLL5alpha expression may be a potential treatment approach for patients with advanced PCa.","['Quan, Yongjun', 'Cui, Yun', 'Wahafu, Wasilijiang', 'Liu, Yuexin', 'Ping, Hao', 'Zhang, Xiaodong']","['Quan Y', 'Cui Y', 'Wahafu W', 'Liu Y', 'Ping H', 'Zhang X']","['Department of Urology, Beijing Chaoyang Hospital, Capital Medical University Beijing 100020, China.', 'Department of Urology, Beijing Tongren Hospital, Capital Medical University Beijing 100730, China.', 'Department of Urology, Beijing Chaoyang Hospital, Capital Medical University Beijing 100020, China.', 'Department of Urology, Beijing Chaoyang Hospital, Capital Medical University Beijing 100020, China.', 'Department of Urology, Beijing Tongren Hospital, Capital Medical University Beijing 100730, China.', 'Department of Urology, Beijing Tongren Hospital, Capital Medical University Beijing 100730, China.', 'Department of Urology, Beijing Chaoyang Hospital, Capital Medical University Beijing 100020, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200501,United States,Am J Cancer Res,American journal of cancer research,101549944,,,,PMC7269778,['NOTNLM'],"['AR', 'MLL5alpha', 'NDRG1', 'Prostate cancer', 'enzalutamide', 'histone methylation']",2020/06/09 06:00,2020/06/09 06:01,['2020/06/09 06:00'],"['2020/02/22 00:00 [received]', '2020/04/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/06/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/09 06:01 [medline]']",,epublish,Am J Cancer Res. 2020 May 1;10(5):1608-1629. eCollection 2020.,,['None.'],['AJCR Copyright (c) 2020.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The objective of this clinical case is to highlight the challenges of the clinical presentation and to emphasize the importance of this manifestation ensuring timely diagnosis and therapy. Here, we present a 43-year-old man who was diagnosed with acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) after being evaluated for unintentional weight loss, subcutaneous nodules, thrombocytopenia, and anemia. The patient underwent chemotherapy with complete remission and presented 4 months later with dysphagia and cranial nerve palsies. Appropriate imaging and biopsy led to a diagnosis of myeloid sarcoma, and a decision was made to begin reinduction chemotherapy for AML achieving a second complete remission although his neurological deficits did not improve. Our case illustrates the protean presentation of myeloid sarcomas; clinicians should have a high suspicion for MS and remain vigilant when unexplained signs and symptoms arise in the background of a myeloid malignancy although challenges still remain when presentation is de novo. Advancements in understanding the pathophysiology of MS have been performed but remain not completely understood. High clinical suspicion, appropriate imaging, biopsy techniques, and expertise are paramount for timely diagnosis and treatment.","['Mendez-Hernandez, A', 'Andrade, X A', 'Upadhyay, S', 'Parra-Rodriguez, L M', 'Caldeira, E', 'Paz, L H', 'Mann, H', 'Zia, M', 'Sumoza, L']","['Mendez-Hernandez A', 'Andrade XA', 'Upadhyay S', 'Parra-Rodriguez LM', 'Caldeira E', 'Paz LH', 'Mann H', 'Zia M', 'Sumoza L']","['Department of Medicine, John H.

CircRNA expression profile in bone marrow mononuclear cells from 5 AML patients and 5 healthy donor controls (HCs) was evaluated by microarray. Then, 10 candidate circRNAs (top 5 upregulated and top 5 downregulated) from microarray were validated by RT-qPCR in 130 AML patients and 50 HCs. Finally, the effects of circRNA annexin A2 (circ-ANXA2) knockdown on cell proliferation, apoptosis, chemosensitivity to cytarabine, daunorbicin and potential target microRNAs were assessed in THP-1 and KG-1 cells. By microarray, 173 upregulated and 181 downregulated circRNAs were found in AML patients than HCs, and these circRNAs were found in AML patients compared with HCs, and these circRNAs were implicated in AML-related pathways such as ErbB and EGFR pathways. By RT-qPCR, 9 of 10 candidate circRNAs (including circ-RPS6KB1, circ-CSMD2, circ-PTK2, circ-ANXA2, circ-PWP2, circ-RBM5, circ-ZZEF1, circ-GSK3B and circ-FOXP1) were dysregulated in AML patients compared with HCs. Circ-ANXA2 correlated with higher disease risk, poor risk stratification, lower complete remission level, shorter event-free survival and overall survival in AML. In cellular experiments, circ-ANXA2 was upregulated in AML cell lines, and its knockdown suppressed proliferation, enhanced apoptosis of THP-1 and KG-1 cells and increased their chemosensitivity to cytarabine and daunorbicin. Additionally, circ-ANXA2 knockdown promoted microRNA (miR)-23a-5p and miR-503-3p expression in THP-1 and KG-1 cells. In conclusion, our findings provide a macroscopic view of the circRNA expression profile in AML, and demonstrate that circ-ANXA2 may be a potential biomarker and therapeutic target for AML.","['Ding, Yi', 'Dong, Yan', 'Lu, Huina', 'Luo, Xiu', 'Fu, Jianfei', 'Xiu, Bing', 'Liang, Aibin', 'Zhang, Wenjun']","['Ding Y', 'Dong Y', 'Lu H', 'Luo X', 'Fu J', 'Xiu B', 'Liang A', 'Zhang W']","['Department of Hematology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine Shanghai 200065, P.R.

IL-15 administered by CIV at 2 mcg/kg/day yielded a 38-fold increase in 10- day number of circulating NK cells, a 358-fold increase in CD56(bright) NK cells and a 5.8-fold increase in CD8 T cells. However, IL-15 preparations administered as monotherapy were ineffective, due to actions of immunological checkpoints and due to the lack of tumor specific targeting by NK cells. To circumvent checkpoints, trials of IL-15 in combination with other anticancer agents were initiated. Tumor-bearing mice receiving IL-15 with antibodies to CTLA-4 and PD-L1 manifested marked prolongation of survival compared to mice receiving IL-15 with either agent alone. In translation, a phase I trial was initiated involving IL-15 (rhIL-15), nivolumab and ipilimumab in patients with malignancy (NCT03388632). In rhesus macaques CIV IL-15 at 20 mug/kg/day for 10 days led to an 80-fold increase in number of circulating effector memory CD8 T cells. However, administration of gammac cytokines such as IL-15 led to paralysis/depression of CD4 T-cells that was mediated through transient expression of SOCS3 that inhibited the STAT5 signaling pathway. This lost CD4 helper role could be restored alternatively by CD40 agonists. In the TRAMP-C2 prostate tumor model the combination of IL-15 with agonistic anti-CD40 produced additive effects in terms of numbers of TRAMP-C2 tumor specific Spas/SCNC/9H tetramer positive CD8 T cells expressed and tumor responses. A clinical trial is being initiated for patients with cancer using an intralesional anti-CD40 in combination with CIV rhIL-15. To translate IL-15-mediated increases in NK cells, we investigated combination therapy of IL-15 with anticancer monoclonal antibodies including rituximab in mouse models of EL-4 lymphoma transfected with human CD20 and with alemtuzumab (CAMPATH-1H) in a xenograft model of adult T cell leukemia (ATL).

Two viral genes, Tax and HTLV-1 bZIP factor (HBZ) play critical roles in viral transcription and promotion of T-cell proliferation, respectively. Tax is a potent transactivator not only for viral transcription but also for many cellular oncogenic pathways, such as the NF-kappaB pathway. HBZ is a suppressor of viral transcription and has the potential to change the immunophenotype of infected cells, conferring an effector regulatory T cell (eTreg)-like signature (CD4+ CD25+ CCR4+ TIGIT+ Foxp3+) and enhancing the proliferation of this subset. Reports that mice transgenic for either gene develop malignant tumors suggest that both Tax and HBZ are involved in leukemogenesis by HTLV-1. However, the immunogenicity of Tax is very high, and its expression is generally suppressed in vivo. Recently, it was found that Tax can be expressed transiently in a small subpopulation of adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma (ATL) cells and plays a critical role in maintenance of the overall population. HBZ is expressed in almost all infected cells except for the rare Tax-expressing cells, and activates the pathways associated with cell proliferation. These findings indicate that HTLV-1 fine-tunes the expression of viral genes to control the mode of viral propagation. The interplay between Tax and HBZ is the basis of a sophisticated strategy to evade host immune surveillance and increase transmission - and can lead to ATL as a byproduct.","['Yasunaga, Jun-Ichirou']",['Yasunaga JI'],"['Department of Hematology, Rheumatology and Infectious Disease, Faculty of Life Sciences, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200519,Switzerland,Front Microbiol,Frontiers in microbiology,101548977,,,,PMC7248384,['NOTNLM'],"['Foxp3', 'HTLV-1 bZIP factor', 'Tax', 'adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma', 'human T-cell leukemia virus type 1']",2020/06/09 06:00,2020/06/09 06:01,['2020/06/09 06:00'],"['2020/03/10 00:00 [received]', '2020/04/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/06/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/09 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fmicb.2020.00979 [doi]'],epublish,Front Microbiol. 2020 May 19;11:979. doi: 10.3389/fmicb.2020.00979. eCollection 2020.,,,['Copyright (c) 2020 Yasunaga.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the potential role of DLXs methylation in myeloid neoplasms such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) remains to be elucidated. Clinical significance of DLXs methylation/expression was analyzed in patient with AML and MDS. The functional roles of DLXs were determined in vitro. In the identification stage, we found that lower DLX5 expression was correlated with prognosis in AML among all DLXs analyzed by The Cancer Genome Atlas datasets. In the validation stage, we revealed that reduced DLX5 expression was frequently occurred, and was also correlated with promoter hypermethylation in AML evaluated by targeted bisulfite sequencing. Epigenetic studies also showed that DLX5 promoter DNA methylation was associated with its expression. By quantitative polymerase chain reaction, we also validated that DLX5 hypermethylation was frequent event in both AML and MDS, and also correlated with MDS transformation to leukemia. Moreover, DLX5 hypermethylation was associated with lower rate of complete remission and shorter time of leukemia-free/overall survival, and was also confirmed by Logistic/Cox regression analysis. Functional studies revealed the antiproliferative and pro-apoptotic effects of DLX5 in MDS-derived AML cell-line SKM-1. Finally, bioinformatics analysis demonstrated that DLX5 functioned in leukemogenesis may be through the association with PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Collectively, our findings demonstrated that DLX5 methylation, negatively correlated DLX5 expression, was a potential prognostic and predictive indicator in patients with AML and MDS, which could also act as an epigenetic driver in myeloid neoplasms.","['Zhang, Ting-Juan', 'Xu, Zi-Jun', 'Gu, Yu', 'Wen, Xiang-Mei', 'Ma, Ji-Chun', 'Zhang, Wei', 'Deng, Zhao-Qun', 'Leng, Jia-Yan', 'Qian, Jun', 'Lin, Jiang', 'Zhou, Jing-Dong']","['Zhang TJ', 'Xu ZJ', 'Gu Y', 'Wen XM', 'Ma JC', 'Zhang W', 'Deng ZQ', 'Leng JY', 'Qian J', 'Lin J', 'Zhou JD']","[""Department of Hematology, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, P.

METHODS: The authors conducted a single-site randomized trial of a video educational tool versus a verbal description of hospice in 150 hospitalized patients with advanced cancer and their caregivers. Patients without a caregiver were eligible. Intervention participants (75 patients and 18 caregivers) viewed a 6-minute video depicting hospice. Control participants (75 patients and 26 caregivers) received a verbal description identical to the video narrative. The primary outcome was patient preference for hospice. Secondary outcomes included patient and/or caregiver knowledge and perceptions of hospice, and hospice use. RESULTS: Between February 2017 and January 2019, approximately 55.7% of eligible patients (150 of 269 eligible patients) and 44 caregivers were enrolled. After the intervention, there was no difference noted with regard to patients' preferences for hospice (86.7% vs 82.7%; P = .651). Patients in the video group reported greater knowledge regarding hospice (9.0 vs 8.4; P = .049) and were less likely to endorse that hospice is only about death (6.7% vs 21.6%; P = .010). Among deceased patients, those assigned to the intervention were more likely to have used hospice (85.2% vs 63.6%; P = .01) and to have had a longer hospice length of stay (median, 12 days vs 3 days; P < .001). After the intervention, caregivers assigned to view the video were more likely to prefer hospice for their loved ones (94.4% vs 65.4%; P = .031), reported greater knowledge concerning hospice (9.7% vs 8.0%; P = .001), and were less likely to endorse that hospice is only about death (0.0% vs 23.1%; P = .066). CONCLUSIONS: A hospice video did not significantly impact patients' preferences for hospice care. Patients with advanced cancer and their caregivers who were assigned to view the video were more informed regarding hospice and reported more favorable perceptions of hospice. Patients were more likely to use hospice and to have a longer hospice length of stay.","['El-Jawahri, Areej', 'Traeger, Lara', 'Greer, Joseph A', 'Vanbenschoten, Olivia', 'Markovitz, Netana', 'Cashavelly, Barbara', 'Tata, Lee Ann', 'Nipp, Ryan D', 'Reynolds, Kerry L', 'Goyal, Lipika', 'Bhatt, Sunil', 'Fishman, Sarah', 'Horick, Nora', 'Li, Zhigang', 'Volandes, Angelo', 'Temel, Jennifer S']","['El-Jawahri A', 'Traeger L', 'Greer JA', 'Vanbenschoten O', 'Markovitz N', 'Cashavelly B', 'Tata LA', 'Nipp RD', 'Reynolds KL', 'Goyal L', 'Bhatt S', 'Fishman S', 'Horick N', 'Li Z', 'Volandes A', 'Temel JS']","['Department of Oncology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Department of Psychiatry, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Department of Psychiatry, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Department of Oncology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Department of Oncology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Department of Oncology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Department of Oncology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Department of Oncology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Department of Oncology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Department of Oncology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Department of Oncology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Department of Oncology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Department of Biostatistics, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'University of Florida at Gainesville, Gainesville, Florida, USA.', 'Department of Oncology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Department of Oncology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.']",['eng'],"['Scholar in Clinical Research/Leukemia and Lymphoma Society', 'Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation']","['Journal Article', 'Pragmatic Clinical Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200608,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Caregivers/education/*psychology', '*Hospice Care', 'Hospices', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/psychology/*therapy', 'Patient Preference', '*Terminal Care']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*advanced cancer', '*hospice', '*hospice knowledge', '*hospice preferences', '*hospice use', '*video education aid']",2020/06/09 06:00,2021/05/21 06:00,['2020/06/09 06:00'],"['2020/02/02 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/28 00:00 [revised]', '2020/04/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/21 06:00 [medline]', '2020/06/09 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.32967 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2020 Aug 1;126(15):3569-3578. doi: 10.1002/cncr.32967.

While patients who receive treatment are all at risk of side effects, about one-fifth of them have sustained responses. It is crucial to figure out the underlying mechanism of how the immune system regulates the nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) microenvironment to improve the benefit of immunotherapy. Regarding glucose metabolism, the initial step is to generate glucose-6-phosphate by phosphorylating glucose with hexokinases-3 (HK3). According to a recent study, HK3 has a functional role in the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia and colorectal cancer. RESULTS: Here, we studied the co-expression relationship between the glycolytic pathway gene and the immune checkpoint gene and found that the expression of HK3 in tumor tissues may be related to immune status. By analyzing The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data, we found that the expression of HK3 was closely related to the main clinical features as well as to molecular characteristics. We also predicted that cases with low expression of HK3 were usually malignant entities and were shown to be obvious genomic aberrations of driver oncogenes. At the same time, gene ontology analysis based on significantly related genes in HK3 expression showed that HK3 expression was linked to inflammatory activity and immune response. Additionally, HK3 showed a remarkable trend in predicting the efficacy of immunotherapy for patients receiving Keytruda (PD-1 monoclonal antibody) treatment. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first comprehensive study to characterize HK3 expression in NSCLC from molecular and clinical aspects.","['Tuo, Zhan', 'Zheng, Xin', 'Zong, Yan', 'Li, Jie', 'Zou, Chunyan', 'Lv, Yi', 'Liu, Jun']","['Tuo Z', 'Zheng X', 'Zong Y', 'Li J', 'Zou C', 'Lv Y', 'Liu J']","['Cancer Center, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Cancer Center, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Cancer Center, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Cancer Center, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', ""The People's Hospital of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Nanning, Guangxi, 530021, China."", 'Department of Pharmacy, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430022, China.', 'Cancer Center, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,Clin Transl Med,Clinical and translational medicine,101597971,,,,PMC7240846,['NOTNLM'],"['HK3', 'NSCLC', 'immune infiltrates', 'immunotherapy']",2020/06/09 06:00,2020/06/09 06:01,['2020/06/09 06:00'],"['2020/02/20 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/01 00:00 [revised]', '2020/03/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/06/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/09 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1002/ctm2.6 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Transl Med. 2020 Jan;10(1):319-330. doi: 10.1002/ctm2.6.,"['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6740-5374', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1936-5969']",,"['(c) 2020 The Authors.

Fever resolution and buttock pain alleviation were observed over the next months. We observed diffuse fibrosis in the bone marrow at day 162 and day 364 after cord blood transplantation. Moreover, the FDG accumulation was significantly reduced on PET-CT. BMN is not widely recognized despite its potential association with hematologic malignancies.

Anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR T) cell is a promising treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We studied 11 patients with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia that relapsed after allo-HSCT between September 2017 and October 2019. Patients were treated with a dose of single-infusion donor-derived anti-CD19 CAR T cells. RESULTS: Eight patients (72.7%) experienced morphologic remissions. Seven (63.6%) experienced minimal residual disease-negative remission. The ongoing complete remission (CR) duration of 2 patients reached 22 months. The median overall survival was 9 months (range, 2-22 months). Only one patient with grade 1 acute graft-versus-host disease was observed. Two patients (18.2%) developed grade 3/4 cytokine release syndrome. CONCLUSION: This prospective study showed allogeneic donor-derived anti-CD19 CAR T-cell therapy is an effective and safe salvage regimen for patients with relapsed/refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia after allo-HSCT. Further randomized and multicenter investigations are needed to evaluate their potential role in relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia therapies after allo-HSCT.","['Hua, Jingsheng', 'Zhang, Jian', 'Wu, Xiaoxia', 'Zhou, Lili', 'Bao, Xiebing', 'Han, Yue', 'Miao, Miao', 'Li, Caixia', 'Fu, Zhengzheng', 'Wu, Depei', 'Qian, Weiqing', 'Qiu, Huiying']","['Hua J', 'Zhang J', 'Wu X', 'Zhou L', 'Bao X', 'Han Y', 'Miao M', 'Li C', 'Fu Z', 'Wu D', 'Qian W', 'Qiu H']","['Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Diseases, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Institute of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, Suzhou, PR China; Department of Hematology, Taizhou Municipal Hospital, Taizhou, Zhejiang, PR China.', 'Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Diseases, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Institute of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, Suzhou, PR China.', 'Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Diseases, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Institute of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, Suzhou, PR China.', 'Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Diseases, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Institute of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, Suzhou, PR China.', 'Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Diseases, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Institute of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, Suzhou, PR China.', 'Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Diseases, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Institute of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, Suzhou, PR China.', 'Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Diseases, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Institute of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, Suzhou, PR China.', 'Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Diseases, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Institute of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, Suzhou, PR China.', 'Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Diseases, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Institute of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, Suzhou, PR China.', 'Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Diseases, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Institute of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, Suzhou, PR China.

RNA-cleaving fluorogenic DNAzymes (RFDs) are single-stranded DNA molecules with catalytic activity and can produce fluorescent signals when combined with specific targets. As K562 cells were the first established human immortalized myelogenous leukemia line, we try to screen several RFDs using the crude extracellular mixture of K562 cells through the SELEX process. We obtained an RFD probe A1-3 that is able to distinguish K562 cells from other tumor cell lines. 10 nM of A1-3 can induce an increase of detectable fluorescence signal. Moreover, the RFD assay system can work well for target detection in complex serum matrix. The optimized RFD assay system with low cost also has a desirable ability to exactly distinguish K562 cells after truncation of 20 bases in the 5'end of A1-3. This study is the first report to investigate the RFD system for detection of K562 cells using cell culture supernatants as the complex target.

New discoveries regarding protein complexes, interaction partners, interaction domains, and biological roles of players that are part of these pathways are emerging. The fourth Vancouver Autophagy Symposium showcased research that expands our understanding of the protein interaction networks and molecular mechanisms underlying autophagy and other cellular stress responses in the context of distinct stressors. In the keynote presentation, Dr. Wade Harper described his team's recent discovery of a novel reticulophagy receptor for selective autophagic degradation of the endoplasmic reticulum, and discussed molecular mechanisms involved in ribophagy and non-autophagic ribosomal turnover. In other presentations, both omic and targeted approaches were used to reveal molecular players of other cellular stress responses including amyloid body and stress granule formation, anastasis, and extracellular vesicle biogenesis. Additional topics included the roles of autophagy in disease pathogenesis, autophagy regulatory mechanisms, and crosstalk between autophagy and cellular metabolism in anti-tumor immunity. The relationship between autophagy and other cell stress responses remains a relatively unexplored area in the field, with future investigations required to understand how the various processes are coordinated and connected in cells and tissues.Abbreviations: A-bodies: amyloid bodies; ACM: amyloid-converting motif; AMFR/gp78: autocrine motility factor receptor; ATG: autophagy-related; ATG4B: autophagy related 4B cysteine peptidase; CALCOCO2/NDP52: calcium binding and coiled-coil domain 2; CAR T: chimeric antigen receptor T; CASP3: caspase 3; CCPG1: cell cycle progression 1; CAR: chimeric antigen receptor; CML: chronic myeloid leukemia; CCOCs: clear cell ovarian cancers; CVB3: coxsackievirus B3; CRISPR-Cas9: clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-CRISPR associated protein 9; DDXs: DEAD-box helicases; EIF2S1/EIF-2alpha: eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 subunit alpha; EIF2AK3: eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha kinase 3; ER: endoplasmic reticulum; EV: extracellular vesicle; FAO: fatty acid oxidation; GABARAP: GABA type A receptor-associated protein; ILK: integrin linked kinase; ISR: integrated stress response; MTOR: mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase; MPECs: memory precursory effector T cells; MAVS: mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein; NBR1: NBR1 autophagy cargo receptor; PI4KB/PI4KIIIbeta: phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase beta; PLEKHM1: pleckstrin homology and RUN domain containing M1; RB1CC1: RB1 inducible coiled-coil 1; RTN3: reticulon 3; rIGSRNAs: ribosomal intergenic noncoding RNAs; RPL29: ribosomal protein L29; RPS3: ribosomal protein S3; S. cerevisiae: Saccharomyces cerevisiae; sEV: small extracellular vesicles; S. pombe: Schizosaccharomyces pombe; SQSTM1: sequestosome 1; SF3B1: splicing factor 3b subunit 1; SILAC-MS: stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture-mass spectrometry; SNAP29: synaptosome associated protein 29; TEX264: testis expressed 264, ER-phagy receptor; TNBC: triple-negative breast cancer; ULK1: unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase 1; VAS: Vancouver Autophagy Symposium.","['Ho, Cally J', 'Samarasekera, Gayathri', 'Rothe, Katharina', 'Xu, Jing', 'Yang, Kevin C', 'Leung, Emily', 'Chan, Michelle', 'Jiang, Xiaoyan', 'Gorski, Sharon M']","['Ho CJ', 'Samarasekera G', 'Rothe K', 'Xu J', 'Yang KC', 'Leung E', 'Chan M', 'Jiang X', 'Gorski SM']","[""Canada's Michael Smith Genome Sciences Centre, BC Cancer, Vancouver, BC, Canada."", 'Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, BC, Canada.', ""Canada's Michael Smith Genome Sciences Centre, BC Cancer, Vancouver, BC, Canada."", 'Department of Medical Genetics, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada.', 'Department of Medical Genetics, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada.', 'Terry Fox Laboratory, BC Cancer, Vancouver, BC, Canada.', ""Canada's Michael Smith Genome Sciences Centre, BC Cancer, Vancouver, BC, Canada."", 'Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, BC, Canada.', ""Canada's Michael Smith Genome Sciences Centre, BC Cancer, Vancouver, BC, Canada."", 'Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, BC, Canada.', ""Canada's Michael Smith Genome Sciences Centre, BC Cancer, Vancouver, BC, Canada."", 'Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, BC, Canada.', ""Canada's Michael Smith Genome Sciences Centre, BC Cancer, Vancouver, BC, Canada."", 'Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, BC, Canada.', 'Department of Medical Genetics, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada.', 'Terry Fox Laboratory, BC Cancer, Vancouver, BC, Canada.', ""Canada's Michael Smith Genome Sciences Centre, BC Cancer, Vancouver, BC, Canada."", 'Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, BC, Canada.', 'Department of Medical Genetics, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada.']",['eng'],['MOP-78882/CIHR/Canada'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200607,United States,Autophagy,Autophagy,101265188,"['0 (Autophagy-Related Proteins)', '0 (Proteome)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Autophagy', 'Autophagy-Related Proteins/metabolism', 'Disease', 'Humans', 'Proteome/metabolism', 'Proteomics', '*Stress, Physiological']",PMC8078713,['NOTNLM'],"['*Cellular stress responses', '*Vancouver autophagy symposium', '*macroautophagy', '*proteomics', '*selective autophagy']",2020/06/09 06:00,2021/11/26 06:00,['2020/06/09 06:00'],"['2020/06/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/26 06:00 [medline]', '2020/06/09 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/15548627.2020.1775394 [doi]'],ppublish,Autophagy. 2021 Apr;17(4):1028-1033. doi: 10.1080/15548627.2020.1775394.

The objective of this study was to identify correlations between donor HLA allotypes and CMV disease incidence in patients with acute myeloid leukemia who had undergone allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Methods and materials we retrospectively analyzed the medical records of 613 donors and recipients with acute myeloid leukemia who had received an allogeneic HSCT from matched sibling (n = 260), unrelated (n = 168), or haploidentical (n = 186) donors, from 2012 to 2017. The HLA-A, -B, -C, and -DRB1 allotypes in the donors were determined using sequence-based typing. Overall, CMV disease incidence was significantly associated with three genotype alleles, HLA-A*30:04:01G, -B*51:01:01G, and -DRB1*09:01:02G. In the donor CMV IgG seropositive subgroup, CMV disease incidence was significantly associated with HLA-B*51:01:01G and -DRB1*09:01:02G. In the IgG seropositive donors in the unrelated allo-HSCT subgroup CMV disease incidence was also significantly associated with HLA-B*51:01:01G. In the CMV seropositive donors in the haploidentical allo-HSCT subgroup, the incidence of CMV disease was significantly associated with HLA-A*24:02:01G and -DRB1*09:01:02G. HLA-DRB1*13:02:01G was a protective marker among IgG seropositive donors in the unrelated allo-HSCT recipient category. Discussion and conclusions The incidence of CMV disease among HSCT recipients varies according to donor HLA alleles and the donor CMV IgG serostatus. Certain donor HLA alleles can be considered to be risk or protective markers. Donors' HLA types and CMV IgG serostatus should be considered in donor selection.","['Min, Gi-June', 'Kim, Hee-Je', 'Kim, Tai-Gyu', 'Hyun, You-Seok', 'Hyun, Seung-Joo', 'Baek, In-Cheol', 'Yoon, Seug

Our purpose was to define factors and setup cut-offs that may help better identify patients at-risk for developing AKI following HDMTX. All consecutive patients who received MTX dose >/=1 g were retrospectively reviewed. We compared patients with or without renal toxicity. We used a logistic regression model to define baseline variables associated with AKI. Overall survival (OS) was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method employing log-rank test. Between 2012 and 2017, 160 patients were included with a total of 265 courses. Indications included: primary central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma, CNS prophylaxis in other lymphoma types, acute lymphatic leukemia and others. Median age at diagnosis was 58 years (range, 18-84), 54% were males, median MTX dose was 1941 mg/m(2) (range, 743-5442) and AKI developed in 9% of drug administrations (n = 24). In univariate analysis: age > 40, LDH > 380 units/L, eGFR < 112 mL/min, albumin <3.6 mg/dL at baseline and Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) were associated with AKI. In multivariable analysis, only LDH > 380 units/L (OR = 4.1, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04-20.9, P = .04) and albumin levels <3.6 g/dL (OR = 4.17, 95% CI 1.04-6.5, P = .04) remained significant. In patients with AKI, median drug elimination was longer (8 days vs 5 days). In 80% of cases, the creatinine levels returned to normal within 1 month. Yet, the median survival of patients who developed AKI was 37 months, compared to 145 months in patients without AKI (Log rank = 0.015). In conclusion, LDH > 380 units/L and albumin <3.6 g/dL were the strongest factors associated with AKI in patients receiving HDMTX. Although the rise in creatinine levels was almost uniformly reversible, AKI was associated with increased mortality rates.","['Amitai, Irina', 'Rozovski, Uri', 'El-Saleh, Reem', 'Shimony, Shai', 'Shepshelovich, Daniel', 'Rozen-Zvi, Benaya', 'Raanani, Pia', 'Gafter-Gvili, Anat', 'Gurion, Ronit']","['Amitai I', 'Rozovski U', 'El-Saleh R', 'Shimony S', 'Shepshelovich D', 'Rozen-Zvi B', 'Raanani P', 'Gafter-Gvili A', 'Gurion R']","['Odette Cancer Center, Sunnybrook Health Sciences Center, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'Institute of Hematology, Davidoff Cancer Center, Rabin Medical Center, Petah Tikva, Israel.', 'Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'Institute of Hematology, Davidoff Cancer Center, Rabin Medical Center, Petah Tikva, Israel.', 'Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'Medicine I, Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'Department of Nephrology and Hypertension, Rabin Medical Center, Petah-Tikva, Israel.', 'Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'Institute of Hematology, Davidoff Cancer Center, Rabin Medical Center, Petah Tikva, Israel.', 'Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'Institute of Hematology, Davidoff Cancer Center, Rabin Medical Center, Petah Tikva, Israel.', 'Department of Internal Medicine A, Rabin Medical Center, Petah Tikva, Israel.', 'Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'Institute of Hematology, Davidoff Cancer Center, Rabin Medical Center, Petah Tikva, Israel.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",20200624,England,Hematol Oncol,Hematological oncology,8307268,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Acute Kidney Injury/*chemically induced/*pathology', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/*adverse effects', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate', 'Young Adult']",,['NOTNLM'],"['acute kidney injury', 'albumin', 'lactic dehydrogenase', 'methotrexate', 'survival']",2020/06/09 06:00,2020/11/03 06:00,['2020/06/08 06:00'],"['2019/10/30 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/12 00:00 [revised]', '2020/05/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/03 06:00 [medline]', '2020/06/08 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/hon.2759 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematol Oncol. 2020 Oct;38(4):584-588. doi: 10.1002/hon.2759.

In rare instances, however, it produces leukemic infiltrates showing clinical and histopathologic overlap with primary cutaneous B-cell lymphomas including primary cutaneous marginal zone lymphoma (PCMZL). Even less frequently, such findings serve as the initial disease manifestation. We present an exceptional case of a 61-year-old man with no past medical history whose clinical and histopathologic findings raised consideration for PCMZL with abnormal B-cells colonizing germinal center follicles; however, faint CD5 and CD23 co-expression raised the differential diagnosis of CLL/SLL. In light of an ambiguous clinical presentation with widely distributed papules and plaques, peripheral blood flow cytometry was also performed, revealing high count of CLL-type monoclonal B lymphocytosis. Subsequent workup revealed bone marrow involvement and mesenteric lymphadenopathy, supporting the diagnosis of SLL. Follicular colonization by SLL has not been previously reported. Our case underscores the importance of subtle immunophenotypic clues and correlations with clinical and radiologic findings in the workup of B-cell lymphomas presenting in the skin.","['LeBlanc, Robert E', 'Carter, Joi B', 'Kaur, Prabhjot', 'Lansigan, Frederick']","['LeBlanc RE', 'Carter JB', 'Kaur P', 'Lansigan F']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, Lebanon, New Hampshire, USA.', 'Audrey and Theodor Geisel School of Medicine, Dartmouth College, Hanover, New Hampshire, USA.', 'Audrey and Theodor Geisel School of Medicine, Dartmouth College, Hanover, New Hampshire, USA.', 'Section of Dermatology, Department of Surgery, Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, Lebanon, New Hampshire, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, Lebanon, New Hampshire, USA.', 'Audrey and Theodor Geisel School of Medicine, Dartmouth College, Hanover, New Hampshire, USA.', 'Audrey and Theodor Geisel School of Medicine, Dartmouth College, Hanover, New Hampshire, USA.', 'Section of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center; Lebanon, NHe, Hanover, New Hampshire, USA.']",['eng'],,['Case Reports'],20200906,United States,J Cutan Pathol,Journal of cutaneous pathology,0425124,,IM,"['Diagnosis, Differential', 'Germinal Center/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*diagnosis/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell, Marginal Zone/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Skin Neoplasms/pathology']",,['NOTNLM'],"['CLL/SLL', 'clinical correlation', 'immunohistochemistry', 'lymphoma', 'marginal zone']",2020/06/09 06:00,2021/10/02 06:00,['2020/06/08 06:00'],"['2020/05/06 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/26 00:00 [revised]', '2020/05/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/02 06:00 [medline]', '2020/06/08 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/cup.13765 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cutan Pathol. 2021 Jan;48(1):72-76. doi: 10.1111/cup.13765.

METHODS: A Markov model incorporating transition probabilities between health states was applied to simulate disease progression. The model inputs, including overall survival, progression-free survival, and utility parameters, were obtained from the INO-VATE ALL trial and literatures. The Taiwan Cancer Registry Database and the Health and Welfare Database were utilized to identify the patient cohort and medical costs from the perspective of National Health Insurance Administration. The lifetime medical costs (in 2017 US dollars), quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained, and associated incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) were the main study outcomes. RESULTS: The lifetime medical costs for INO and SOC were $176,795 and $69,496, and the QALYs gained were 2.25 and 0.84, respectively. The ICER for INO versus SOC was $76,044 per QALY gained, which is slightly more than three times Taiwan's gross domestic product per capita (i.e., $73,224). Favorable economic results for INO versus SOC were found with an increased time horizon for model simulation, less discounting for the future benefit, and higher stem cell transplantation (SCT) rate after INO treatment; and among patients aged less than 55 years, with no SCT history, or in the first salvage treatment. CONCLUSIONS: INO versus SOC has higher costs but is more effective. The use of INO is favorable for patients in the early treatment course and when more future benefit associated with INO is considered.","['Lee, Tsung-Ying', 'Chen, Hsuan-Ying', 'Chen, Tsai-Yun', 'Li, Sin-Syue', 'Fang, Wei-Tse', 'Wen, Yao-Chun', 'Lo, Yu-Wen', 'Ou, Huang-Tz']","['Lee TY', 'Chen HY', 'Chen TY', 'Li SS', 'Fang WT', 'Wen YC', 'Lo YW', 'Ou HT']","['Institute of Clinical Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, 1 University Road, Tainan, 70101, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Clinical Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, 1 University Road, Tainan, 70101, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University Hospital, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University Hospital, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.', 'Pfizer Ltd, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Pfizer Ltd, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Pfizer Ltd, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Clinical Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, 1 University Road, Tainan, 70101, Taiwan. huangtz@mail.ncku.edu.tw.', 'Department of Pharmacy, College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan. huangtz@mail.ncku.edu.tw.', 'Department of Pharmacy, National Cheng Kung University Hospital, Tainan, Taiwan. huangtz@mail.ncku.edu.tw.']",['eng'],"['MOST 107-2320-B-006-034/Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan']",['Journal Article'],20200606,Germany,Eur J Health Econ,The European journal of health economics : HEPAC : health economics in prevention and care,101134867,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological)', 'P93RUU11P7 (Inotuzumab Ozogamicin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological/adverse effects/*economics/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/economics', 'Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'Health Expenditures/statistics & numerical data', 'Health Resources/economics/statistics & numerical data', 'Health Services/economics/statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Inotuzumab Ozogamicin/adverse effects/*economics/*therapeutic use', 'Markov Chains', 'Models, Econometric', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Progression-Free Survival', 'Quality-Adjusted Life Years', 'Taiwan']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'Cost-effectiveness analysis', 'Economic modeling', 'Inotuzumab ozogamicin', 'Standard of care']",2020/06/09 06:00,2021/06/16 06:00,['2020/06/08 06:00'],"['2019/11/29 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/16 06:00 [medline]', '2020/06/08 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s10198-020-01207-7 [doi]', '10.1007/s10198-020-01207-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Eur J Health Econ. 2020 Sep;21(7):1105-1116. doi: 10.1007/s10198-020-01207-7.

Herein, newly synthesized cinnolines are evaluated for their possible anticancer activities and suggested mechanisms. In the current study, a simple and efficient synthesis of densely functionalized cinnolines has been developed that relied on multi-component reaction of ethyl 5-cyano-4-methyl-1-aryl-6-oxo-1,6-dihydropyridazine-3-carboxylates with aromatic aldehydes and nitromethane in dioxane/pipridine under controlled microwave heating. Selected cinnolines (4a-c, e, h, j-n, q-v) were tested for possible anticancer activity using in vitro one dose assay at National Cancer institute, USA. Only cinnoline 4b stood out as the most potent cinnoline derivative (mean GI%=26.33) with broad-spectrum antitumor activity against the most tested cancer cell lines from all subpanels. The target cinnoline 4b emerged as the most active derivative against both leukemia RPMI-8226 and melanoma LOX IMVI cell lines (GI% = 106.06 and 82.1) respectively, with IC50 values equal to 17.12 +/- 1.31 and 12.32 +/- 0.75 mug/mL, which are comparable to those of staurosporin; 24.97 +/- 1.47 and 8.45 +/- 0.42 mug/mL, respectively. Cinnoline 4b influenced cell cycle distribution causing pre-G1 apoptosis and cell growth arrest at G2/M phase. It also induced apoptosis in both cell lines as manifested by significant increase in the percent of annexin V-FITC positive apoptotic cells in leukemia RPMI-8226 cells (from 1.09% to 12.47%) and melanoma LOX IMVI (from 1.32% to 19.05%). In addition, it showed lower expression levels of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein, and higher expression levels of pro-apoptotic proteins; Bax, p53, cytochrome c, caspases 3 and 9. CONCLUSION: Induction of mitochondrial intrinsic pathway of apoptosis is a possible mechanism by which cinnoline 4b may confer its anticancer activity.","['Nazmy, Maiiada Hassan', 'Mekheimer, Ramadan Ahmed', 'Shoman, Mai E', 'Abo-Elsebaa, Mohamed', 'Abd-Elmonem, Mohamed', 'Sadek, Kamal Usef']","['Nazmy MH', 'Mekheimer RA', 'Shoman ME', 'Abo-Elsebaa M', 'Abd-Elmonem M', 'Sadek KU']","['Biochemistry Department, Faculty of Pharmacy, Minia University, Minia 61519, Egypt.

Despite the high survival rate, female leukemia survivors are at higher risk of ovarian failure and infertility later in life. Treatment with chemotherapeutic drugs like DOX is associated with damage in ovarian follicles, but the affectation grade of granulosa cells remains unclear. To assess and avoid the possible side-effects of DOX, early biomarkers of ovarian injury and chemotherapy-induced ovarian toxicity should be identified. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged in recent years as a promising new class of biomarkers for drug-induced tissue toxicity. In this study, the effects of DOX on cell viability, steroidogenesis, and miRNA expression were studied in primary granulosa cells (GCs) and in two cellular models (COV434 and KGN cells). We report that compared to other chemotherapeutic drugs, DOX treatment is more detrimental to granulosa cells as observed by decrease of cell viability. Treatment with DOX changes the expression of the aromatase gene (CYP19A1) and the secretion of 17beta-estradiol (E2) in a cell-specific manner. miR-132-3p is dose-dependently increased by DOX in all cellular models. In absence of DOX, miR-132-3p overexpression in COV434 cells has no effect on E2 secretion or CYP19A1 expression. Altogether, these findings contribute to understanding the hormonal disbalance caused by DOX in human ovarian cells and suggest miR-132 as a putative sensor to predict DOX-induced ovarian toxicity.","['Al-Kawlani, Boodor', 'Murrieta-Coxca, Jose Martin', 'Chaiwangyen, Wittaya', 'Frohlich, Karolin', 'Fritzsche, Andreas', 'Winkler, Simone', 'Markert, Udo R', 'Morales-Prieto, Diana M']","['Al-Kawlani B', 'Murrieta-Coxca JM', 'Chaiwangyen W', 'Frohlich K', 'Fritzsche A', 'Winkler S', 'Markert UR', 'Morales-Prieto DM']","['Placenta Lab, Department of Obstetrics, Jena University Hospital, Jena, Germany.', 'Placenta Lab, Department of Obstetrics, Jena University Hospital, Jena, Germany.', 'Placenta Lab, Department of Obstetrics, Jena University Hospital, Jena, Germany; Department of Biochemistry, School of Medical Sciences, University of Phayao, Phayao, Thailand.', 'Placenta Lab, Department of Obstetrics, Jena University Hospital, Jena, Germany.', 'Infertility Center Jena, Jena, Germany.', 'Infertility Center Jena, Jena, Germany.', 'Placenta Lab, Department of Obstetrics, Jena University Hospital, Jena, Germany.

This is currently a topic of much debate. In this review, we will discuss experimental results and basic concepts of inflammatory processes in the pathogenesis of myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN). So, which are the players involved? First, these are the clonal hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) and their normal stem cell counterparts in the bone marrow (BM), as well as their more mature progeny in the BM and the peripheral blood (PB), including neutrophils, macrophages, erythrocytes, and platelets, but also other cell lineages. Second, these cells produce a plethora of inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin 6 (IL6), interleukin 8 (IL8), TNF-alpha (TNFa), interferon-alpha (IFNa), and others. Third, these cells and cytokines act in concert with non-hematopoietic cells, including endothelial cells and mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs). The latter cells, in particular GLI1 positive or leptin receptor (LepR) positive stromal cells, may become activated by the hematopoietic clone to give rise to myofibroblasts, producing excessive fibrosis in the bone marrow (myelofibrosis). Ultimately, the inflammatory and fibrotic circuit involving these three key players may lead to progression of the disease, resulting in BM failure and transformation into acute leukemia, also termed blast crisis. Here, we review the role of these three effectors in the pathogenesis of MPN.","['Koschmieder, Steffen', 'Chatain, Nicolas']","['Koschmieder S', 'Chatain N']","['Department of Hematology, Oncology, Hemostaselogy, and Stem Cell Transplantation, Faculty of Medicine, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany.

The disorder manifested with a severe form of autoimmune hemolytic anemia in the absence of other laboratory abnormalities. The anemia was successfully treated with an intense course of corticosteroids ands witch of immunosuppressive therapy from a calcineurin inhibitor to sirolimus, a mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor.

Defining the positions of H1 on chromatin in situ, therefore, represents a challenge. Immunoprecipitation of formaldehyde-fixed and sonicated chromatin, followed by DNA sequencing (xChIP-seq), is traditionally the method for mapping histones onto DNA elements. But since sonication fragmentation precedes ChIP, there is a consequent loss of information about chromatin higher-order structure. Here, we present a new method, xxChIP-seq, employing antibody binding to fixed intact in situ chromatin, followed by extensive washing, a second fixation, sonication and immunoprecipitation. The second fixation is intended to prevent the loss of specifically bound antibody during washing and subsequent sonication and to prevent antibody shifting to epitopes revealed by the sonication process. In many respects, xxChIP-seq is comparable to immunostaining microscopy, which also involves interaction of the primary antibody with fixed and permeabilized intact cells. The only epitopes displayed after immunostaining are the ""exposed"" epitopes, not ""hidden"" by the fixation of chromatin higher-order structure. Comparison of immunoprecipitated fragments between xChIP-seq versus xxChIP-seq should indicate which epitopes become inaccessible with fixation and identify their associated DNA elements. RESULTS: We determined the genomic distribution of histone variants H1.2 and H1.5 in human myeloid leukemia cells HL-60/S4 and compared their epitope exposure by both xChIP-seq and xxChIP-seq, as well as high-resolution microscopy, illustrating the influences of preserved chromatin higher-order structure in situ. We found that xChIP and xxChIP H1 signals are in general negatively correlated, with differences being more pronounced near active regulatory regions. Among the intriguing observations, we find that transcription-related regions and histone PTMs (i.e., enhancers, promoters, CpG islands, H3K4me1, H3K4me3, H3K9ac, H3K27ac and H3K36me3) exhibit significant deficiencies (depletions) in H1.2 and H1.5 xxChIP-seq reads, compared to xChIP-seq. These observations suggest the existence of in situ transcription-related chromatin higher-order structures stabilized by formaldehyde. CONCLUSION: Comparison of H1 xxChIP-seq to H1 xChIP-seq allows the development of hypotheses on the chromosomal localization of (stabilized) higher-order structure, indicated by the generation of ""hidden"" H1 epitopes following formaldehyde crosslinking. Changes in H1 epitope exposure surrounding averaged chromosomal binding sites or epigenetic modifications can also indicate whether these sites have chromatin higher-order structure. For example, comparison between averaged active or inactive promoter regions suggests that both regions can acquire stabilized higher-order structure with hidden H1 epitopes. However, the H1 xChIP-seq comparison cannot define their differences. Application of the xxChIP-seq versus H1 xChIP-seq method is particularly relevant to chromatin-associated proteins, such as linker histones, that play dynamic roles in establishing chromatin higher-order structure.","['Teif, Vladimir B', 'Gould, Travis J', 'Clarkson, Christopher T', 'Boyd, Logan', 'Antwi, Enoch B', 'Ishaque, Naveed', 'Olins, Ada L', 'Olins, Donald E']","['Teif VB', 'Gould TJ', 'Clarkson CT', 'Boyd L', 'Antwi EB', 'Ishaque N', 'Olins AL', 'Olins DE']","['School of Life Sciences, University of Essex, Wivenhoe Park, Colchester, CO4 3SQ, UK. vteif@essex.ac.uk.', 'Department of Physics & Astronomy, Bates College, Lewiston, ME, USA.', 'School of Life Sciences, University of Essex, Wivenhoe Park, Colchester, CO4 3SQ, UK.', 'Department of Physics & Astronomy, Bates College, Lewiston, ME, USA.', 'StarBird Technologies, LLC, Brunswick, ME, USA.', 'Division of Theoretical Bioinformatics, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Im Neuenheimer Feld 280, Heidelberg, 69120, Germany.', 'Molecular and Cellular Engineering, Centre for Biological Signalling Studies, University of Freiburg, Schanzlestrasse 18, Freiburg im Breisgau, 79104 , Germany.', 'Charite - Universitatsmedizin Berlin, corporate member of Freie Universitat Berlin, Humboldt-Universitat zu Berlin, and Berlin Institute of Health, Berlin, Germany.', 'Digital Health Centre, Berlin Institute of Health (BIH), Anna-Louisa-Karsch-Str. 2, Berlin, 10178 , Germany.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, University of New England, 716 Stevens Avenue, Portland, ME, 04103, USA.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, University of New England, 716 Stevens Avenue, Portland, ME, 04103, USA. dolins@une.edu.']",['eng'],"['P20 GM103423/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', '200733/Z/16/Z/WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200606,England,Epigenetics Chromatin,Epigenetics & chromatin,101471619,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Histones)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromatin/*chemistry', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Sequencing/*methods/standards', 'CpG Islands', 'Epitopes/*chemistry/immunology', 'Histones/*chemistry/immunology', 'Humans', 'Limit of Detection', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Conformation']",PMC7276084,,,2020/06/09 06:00,2021/04/22 06:00,['2020/06/08 06:00'],"['2019/09/01 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/06/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/22 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13072-020-00345-9 [doi]', '10.1186/s13072-020-00345-9 [pii]']",epublish,Epigenetics Chromatin. 2020 Jun 6;13(1):26. doi: 10.1186/s13072-020-00345-9.,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-5931-7534', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6088-0842']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Their introduction to cells has been reported to transform cell lines or increase the colony formation of bone marrow cells, suggesting their survival-supporting ability, which prompted us to examine M-fusion-targeting drugs. To identify compounds that reduce the protein expression level of MEF2D, we developed a high-throughput screening system using 293T cells stably expressing a fusion protein of MEF2D and luciferase, in which the protein expression level of MEF2D was easily measured by a luciferase assay. We screened 3766 compounds with known pharmaceutical activities using this system and selected staurosporine as a potential inducer of the proteolysis of MEF2D. Staurosporine induced the proteolysis of M-fusion proteins in M-fusion (+) ALL cell lines. Proteolysis was inhibited by caspase inhibitors, not proteasome inhibitors, suggesting caspase dependency. Consistent with this result, the growth inhibitory effects of staurosporine were stronger in M-fusion (+) ALL cell lines than in negative cell lines, and caspase inhibitors blocked apoptosis induced by staurosporine. We identified the cleavage site of MEF2D-HNRNPUL1 by caspases and confirmed that its caspase cleavage-resistant mutant was resistant to staurosporine-induced proteolysis. Based on these results, we investigated another Food and Drug Administration-approved caspase activator, venetoclax, and found that it exerted similar effects to staurosporine, namely, the proteolysis of M-fusion proteins and strong growth inhibitory effects in M-fusion (+) ALL cell lines. The present study provides novel insights into drug screening strategies and the clinical indications of venetoclax.","['Tange, Naoyuki', 'Hayakawa, Fumihiko', 'Yasuda, Takahiko', 'Odaira, Koya', 'Yamamoto, Hideyuki', 'Hirano, Daiki', 'Sakai, Toshiyasu', 'Terakura, Seitaro', 'Tsuzuki, Shinobu', 'Kiyoi, Hitoshi']","['Tange N', 'Hayakawa F', 'Yasuda T', 'Odaira K', 'Yamamoto H', 'Hirano D', 'Sakai T', 'Terakura S', 'Tsuzuki S', 'Kiyoi H']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan; Department of Pathophysiological Laboratory Sciences, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.

Accordingly, selective inhibition of specific proteins represents an exciting therapeutic opportunity. Myeloid cell leukemia 1 (MCL1) is an anti-apoptotic protein of the BCL-2 family, which is overexpressed in many cancers. Here, we demonstrate that MCL1 can be modified by the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) at K234 and K238 sites. The SUMOylation of MCL1 can improve its stability by inhibiting the MCL1 ubiquitin-proteasome pathway mediated by the Tripartite motif-containing 11 (TRIM11, a novel MCL1 ubiquitin E3 ligase that we identify in this study). Moreover, SUMOylation of MCL1 increases the proliferation of cancer cells by inhibiting apoptosis. These results suggest that the SUMOylation of MCL1 may play a significant role in the regulation of its function.","['Li, Shujing', 'Wang, Jin', 'Hu, Gaolei', 'Aman, Sattout', 'Li, Bowen', 'Li, Yanan', 'Xia, Kangkai', 'Yang, Yuxi', 'Ahmad, Bashir', 'Wang, Miao', 'Wu, Huijian']","['Li S', 'Wang J', 'Hu G', 'Aman S', 'Li B', 'Li Y', 'Xia K', 'Yang Y', 'Ahmad B', 'Wang M', 'Wu H']","['School of Bioengineering, Key Laboratory of Protein Modification and Disease, Liaoning Province, Dalian University of Technology, China.', 'School of Bioengineering, Key Laboratory of Protein Modification and Disease, Liaoning Province, Dalian University of Technology, China.', 'School of Bioengineering, Key Laboratory of Protein Modification and Disease, Liaoning Province, Dalian University of Technology, China.', 'School of Bioengineering, Key Laboratory of Protein Modification and Disease, Liaoning Province, Dalian University of Technology, China.', 'School of Bioengineering, Key Laboratory of Protein Modification and Disease, Liaoning Province, Dalian University of Technology, China.', 'School of Bioengineering, Key Laboratory of Protein Modification and Disease, Liaoning Province, Dalian University of Technology, China.', 'School of Bioengineering, Key Laboratory of Protein Modification and Disease, Liaoning Province, Dalian University of Technology, China.', 'School of Bioengineering, Key Laboratory of Protein Modification and Disease, Liaoning Province, Dalian University of Technology, China.', 'School of Bioengineering, Key Laboratory of Protein Modification and Disease, Liaoning Province, Dalian University of Technology, China.', 'School of Bioengineering, Key Laboratory of Protein Modification and Disease, Liaoning Province, Dalian University of Technology, China.', 'School of Bioengineering, Key Laboratory of Protein Modification and Disease, Liaoning Province, Dalian University of Technology, China.

Studies have shown that various single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the binding sites of microRNAs contribute to the risk of developing SCZ. We aimed to investigate whether the variants located in the 3'-UTR region of LIF (rs929271T>G) and ATF6B (rs8283G>A) were associated with increased susceptibility to SCZ in a population from the south-east of Iran. In this case-control study, a total of 396 subjects were recruited. SNPs were genotyped via polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method. Genotyping results showed that the G allele of rs929271 significantly increased the risk of SCZ (OR = 1.58 95%CI = 1.19-2.10, p = 0.001). As for rs929271, the GG genotype of co-dominant (OR = 2.54 95%CI = 1.39-4.64, p = 0.002) and recessive (OR = 2.91 95%CI = 1.77-4.80, p < 0.001) models were strongly linked to SCZ. No significant differences were observed between rs8283 polymorphism and predisposition to SCZ. In silico analyses predicted that rs929271 might alter the binding sites of microRNAs, which was believed to have an unclear role in the development of SCZ. Moreover, rs929271 polymorphism changed the LIF-mRNA folding structure. These findings provide fine pieces of evidence regarding the possible effects of LIF polymorphism in the development of SCZ and regulation of the LIF gene targeted by microRNAs.","['Moudi, Mahdiyeh', 'Sargazi, Saman', 'Heidari Nia, Milad', 'Saravani, Ramin', 'Shirvaliloo, Milad', 'Shakiba, Mansoor']","['Moudi M', 'Sargazi S', 'Heidari Nia M', 'Saravani R', 'Shirvaliloo M', 'Shakiba M']","['Genetics of Non-Communicable Disease Research Center, Resistant Tuberculosis Institute, Zahedan University of Medical Sciences, Zahedan, Iran.', 'Cellular and Molecular Research Center, Resistant Tuberculosis Institute, Zahedan University of Medical Sciences, Zahedan, Iran. sgz.biomed@gmail.com.', 'Cellular and Molecular Research Center, Resistant Tuberculosis Institute, Zahedan University of Medical Sciences, Zahedan, Iran.', 'Cellular and Molecular Research Center, Resistant Tuberculosis Institute, Zahedan University of Medical Sciences, Zahedan, Iran. saravaniramin@yahoo.com.', 'Department of Clinical Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Zahedan University of Medical Sciences, Zahedan, Iran. saravaniramin@yahoo.com.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Student Research Committee, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Department of Psychiatry, Zahedan University of Medical Sciences, Zahedan, Iran.', 'Psychosomatic Research Center, Imam Hospital, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200605,United States,J Mol Neurosci,Journal of molecular neuroscience : MN,9002991,"[""0 (3' Untranslated Regions)"", '0 (ATF6B protein, human)', '0 (Activating Transcription Factor 6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (MicroRNAs)']",IM,"[""3' Untranslated Regions"", 'Activating Transcription Factor 6/*genetics', 'Adult', 'Binding Sites', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/chemistry/*genetics', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/metabolism', 'Middle Aged', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Schizophrenia/*genetics']",,['NOTNLM'],"['ATF6B', 'In silico', 'LIF', 'MicroRNAs', 'Schizophrenia']",2020/06/07 06:00,2021/08/20 06:00,['2020/06/07 06:00'],"['2020/03/10 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/20 06:00 [medline]', '2020/06/07 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12031-020-01616-6 [doi]', '10.1007/s12031-020-01616-6 [pii]']",ppublish,J Mol Neurosci. 2020 Dec;70(12):2093-2101. doi: 10.1007/s12031-020-01616-6.

We evaluated clinical features and outcomes associated with chromosome 17p loss or TP53 gene mutations in older, unfit DAC-treated AML patients in a phase II trial. Of 178 patients, 25 had loss of 17p in metaphase cytogenetics; 24 of these had a complex (CK+) and 21 a monosomal karyotype (MK+). In analyses in all patients and restricted to CK+ and MK+ patients, 17p loss tended to associate with higher rates of complete remission (CR), partial remission (PR), or antileukemic effect (ALE). Despite favorable response rates, there was no significant OS difference between patients with or without loss of 17p in the entire cohort or in the CK+ and MK+ cohort. TP53 mutations were identified in eight of 45 patients with material available. Five of the eight TP53-mutated patients had 17p loss. TP53-mutated patients had similar rates of CR/PR/ALE but shorter OS than those with TP53 wild type (P = 0.036). Moreover, patients with a subclone based on mutation data had shorter OS than those without (P = 0.05); only one patient with TP53-mutated AML had a subclone. In conclusion, 17p loss conferred a favorable impact on response rates, even among CK+ and MK+ patients that however could not be maintained. The effect of TP53 mutations appeared to be different; however, patient numbers were low. Future research needs to further dissect the impact of the various TP53 aberrations in HMA-based combination therapies. The limited duration of favorable responses to HMA treatment in adverse-risk genetics AML should prompt physicians to advance allografting for eligible patients in a timely fashion.","['Becker, Heiko', 'Pfeifer, Dietmar', 'Ihorst, Gabriele', 'Pantic, Milena', 'Wehrle, Julius', 'Ruter, Bjorn H', 'Bullinger, Lars', 'Hackanson, Bjorn', 'Germing, Ulrich', 'Kuendgen, Andrea', 'Platzbecker, Uwe', 'Dohner, Konstanze', 'Ganser, Arnold', 'Hagemeijer, Anne', 'Wijermans, Pierre W', 'Dohner, Hartmut', 'Duyster, Justus', 'Lubbert, Michael']","['Becker H', 'Pfeifer D', 'Ihorst G', 'Pantic M', 'Wehrle J', 'Ruter BH', 'Bullinger L', 'Hackanson B', 'Germing U', 'Kuendgen A', 'Platzbecker U', 'Dohner K', 'Ganser A', 'Hagemeijer A', 'Wijermans PW', 'Dohner H', 'Duyster J', 'Lubbert M']","['Department of Medicine I, Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Hugstetter Strasse 55, 79106, Freiburg, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK) partner site, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine I, Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Hugstetter Strasse 55, 79106, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine I, Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Hugstetter Strasse 55, 79106, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Clinical Trials Unit, Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine I, Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Hugstetter Strasse 55, 79106, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine I, Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Hugstetter Strasse 55, 79106, Freiburg, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK) partner site, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine I, Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Hugstetter Strasse 55, 79106, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Charite University Medicine, Berlin, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine I, Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Hugstetter Strasse 55, 79106, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Interdisciplinary Cancer Center Augsburg, Augsburg, Germany.', 'Dept. of Hematology, Oncology and Clincal Immunology, University Clinic Dusseldorf, Heinrich-Heine University Dusseldorf, Dusseldorf, Germany.', 'Dept. of Hematology, Oncology and Clincal Immunology, University Clinic Dusseldorf, Heinrich-Heine University Dusseldorf, Dusseldorf, Germany.', 'University Hospital Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'University Hospital Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Human Genetics, University of Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Haga Ziekenhuis, The Hague, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine I, Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Hugstetter Strasse 55, 79106, Freiburg, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK) partner site, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine I, Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Hugstetter Strasse 55, 79106, Freiburg, Germany. michael.luebbert@uniklinik-freiburg.de.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK) partner site, Freiburg, Germany. michael.luebbert@uniklinik-freiburg.de.']",['eng'],"['SPP 1463 ML 429/8-1;

Here, we demonstrate a systemic reduction in natural killer (NK) cell numbers in SRalpha-tTA/Tet-O-MYC(ON) mice bearing MYC-driven T-lymphomas. Residual mNK cells in spleens of MYC(ON) T-lymphoma-bearing mice exhibit perturbations in the terminal NK effector differentiation pathway. Lymphoma-intrinsic MYC arrests NK maturation by transcriptionally repressing STAT1/2 and secretion of Type I Interferons (IFNs). Treating T-lymphoma-bearing mice with Type I IFN improves survival by rescuing NK cell maturation. Adoptive transfer of mature NK cells is sufficient to delay both T-lymphoma growth and recurrence post MYC inactivation.

Therefore, overexpression P-glycoprotein excluded a large number of anticancer agents from cancer cells, and multidrug resistance happened. Several kinds of bisbenzylisoqunoline alkaloids were reported to modulate P-glycoprotein function and reverse drug resistance. In order to provide more information for their structure activity relationship on P-glycoprotein function, the effects of tetrandrine, isotetrandrine, fangchinoline, berbamine, dauricine, cepharanthine and armepavine on the P-glycoprotein function were compared by using daunorubicin-resistant leukemia MOLT-4 cells in the present study. Among them, tetrandrine exhibited the strongest P-glycoprotein inhibitory effect, followed with fangchinoline and cepharanthine, and subsequently with berbamine or isotetrandrine. However, dauricine and armepavine showed little influence on the P-glycoprotein function. These data revealed that the 18-membered ring of the bisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloids maintained the P-glycoprotein inhibitory activity, suggesting that double isoquinoline units connected by two oxygen bridges were indispensable. Moreover, stereo-configuration of bisbenzylisoquinoline 3D structures determined their inhibitory activities, which provided a new viewpoint to recognize the specificity of binding pocket in P-glycoprotein. Our data also indicated that 3D chemical structure was more sensitive than 2D to predict the P-glycoprotein inhibitory-potencies of bisbenzylisoqunoline alkaloids.","['Xu, Wencheng', 'Chen, Shuhe', 'Wang, Xiaoqin', 'Wu, Hongguang', 'Yamada, Haruki', 'Hirano, Toshihiko']","['Xu W', 'Chen S', 'Wang X', 'Wu H', 'Yamada H', 'Hirano T']","['Department of Pharmacy, Hubei Provincial Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Wuhan, PR China; Institute of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Hubei Province Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Wuhan, PR China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Hubei Provincial Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Wuhan, PR China; Institute of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Hubei Province Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Wuhan, PR China.', 'Institute of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Hubei Province Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Wuhan, PR China; Department of Nephrology, Hubei Provincial Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Wuhan, PR China.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacology, School of Pharmacy, Tokyo University of Pharmacy and Life Sciences, 1432-1 Horinouchi, Hachioji, Tokyo 192-0392, Japan.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacology, School of Pharmacy, Tokyo University of Pharmacy and Life Sciences, 1432-1 Horinouchi, Hachioji, Tokyo 192-0392, Japan.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacology, School of Pharmacy, Tokyo University of Pharmacy and Life Sciences, 1432-1 Horinouchi, Hachioji, Tokyo 192-0392, Japan.

Ibrutinib is often used to treat patients who are younger than the patients originally included in theclinical trials have additional unfavorable prognostic factors and suffer from additional comorbidities excluded from the original phase III trials. Our objective was to examine current clinical practices and their impact in this expanded population of CLL patients who often require adjustments in the standard prescribed dose and schedule of therapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An extensive review of the medical literature was conducted to establish the consensus on ibrutinib dose modifications in patients with CLL. Twenty-nine studies were reviewed including fourteen clinical trials and fifteen ""real-world practice"" studies. RESULTS: The average discontinuation rate was similar between clinical trials and ""real-world practice"" studies though the reasons for discontinuation differed. CLL progression was a more common reason for discontinuation in clinical trial studies while toxicity was a more common reason for discontinuation in ""real-world practice"" studies. Some studies have suggested worse outcomes in patients requiring dose reductions in ibrutinib while others have shown no change in treatment efficacy in patients requiring dose reductions due to concomitant CYP medications or increased immunosuppression post-transplant. CONCLUSION: The impact of ibrutinib dose modifications on clinical outcome remains unclear. Patients on concomitant CYP3A inhibitors should be prescribed a lower dose than the standard 420 mg daily, in order to maintain comparable pharmacologic properties. Further research is required to establish definitive clinical practice guidelines.","['Hardy-Abeloos, Camille', 'Pinotti, Rachel', 'Gabrilove, Janice']","['Hardy-Abeloos C', 'Pinotti R', 'Gabrilove J']","['Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Tisch Cancer Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.', 'Library Education and Research Services, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Tisch Cancer Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA. janice.gabrilove@mssm.edu.']",['eng'],['UL1 TR001433/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200605,England,J Hematol Oncol,Journal of hematology & oncology,101468937,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '1X70OSD4VX (ibrutinib)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (CYP3A protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (BTK protein, human)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",IM,"['Adenine/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Biotransformation', 'Clinical Studies as Topic', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A/metabolism', 'Disease Susceptibility', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Early Termination of Clinical Trials', 'Hematologic Diseases/chemically induced', 'Humans', 'Infections/etiology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/enzymology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pilot Projects', 'Piperidines/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', ""Practice Patterns, Physicians'/statistics & numerical data"", 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use']",PMC7275592,['NOTNLM'],"['*CLL', '*Ibrutinib', '*discontinuation', '*dosage']",2020/06/07 06:00,2021/05/18 06:00,['2020/06/07 06:00'],"['2019/12/15 00:00 [received]', '2020/04/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/06/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/18 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13045-020-00870-w [doi]', '10.1186/s13045-020-00870-w [pii]']",epublish,J Hematol Oncol. 2020 Jun 5;13(1):66. doi: 10.1186/s13045-020-00870-w.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Generally, leukemia patients differ in their sensitivity to L-asparaginase; however, the mechanism underlying their inter-individual differences is still not fully understood. We have previously shown that L-asparaginase rewires the biosynthetic and bioenergetic pathways of leukemia cells to activate both anti-leukemic and pro-survival processes. Herein, we investigated the relationship between the metabolic profile of leukemia cells and their sensitivity to currently used cytostatic drugs. METHODS: Altogether, 19 leukemia cell lines, primary leukemia cells from 26 patients and 2 healthy controls were used. Glycolytic function and mitochondrial respiration were measured using Seahorse Bioanalyzer. Sensitivity to cytostatics was measured using MTS assay and/or absolute count and flow cytometry. Mitochondrial membrane potential was determined as TMRE fluorescence. RESULTS: Using cell lines and primary patient samples we characterized the basal metabolic state of cells derived from different leukemia subtypes and assessed their sensitivity to cytostatic drugs. We found that leukemia cells cluster into distinct groups according to their metabolic profile. Lymphoid leukemia cell lines and patients sensitive to L-asparaginase clustered into the low glycolytic cluster. While lymphoid leukemia cells with lower sensitivity to L-asparaginase together with resistant normal mononuclear blood cells gathered into the high glycolytic cluster. Furthermore, we observed a correlation of specific metabolic parameters with the sensitivity to L-asparaginase. Greater ATP-linked respiration and lower basal mitochondrial membrane potential in cells significantly correlated with higher sensitivity to L-asparaginase. No such correlation was found in the other cytostatic drugs tested by us. CONCLUSIONS: These data support that cell metabolism plays a prominent role in the treatment effect of L-asparaginase. Based on these findings, leukemia patients with lower sensitivity to L-asparaginase with no specific genetic characterization could be identified by their metabolic profile.","['Hlozkova, Katerina', 'Pecinova, Alena', 'Alquezar-Artieda, Natividad', 'Pajuelo-Reguera, David', 'Simcikova, Marketa', 'Hovorkova, Lenka', 'Rejlova, Katerina', 'Zaliova, Marketa', 'Mracek, Tomas', 'Kolenova, Alexandra', 'Stary, Jan', 'Trka, Jan', 'Starkova, Julia']","['Hlozkova K', 'Pecinova A', 'Alquezar-Artieda N', 'Pajuelo-Reguera D', 'Simcikova M', 'Hovorkova L', 'Rejlova K', 'Zaliova M', 'Mracek T', 'Kolenova A', 'Stary J', 'Trka J', 'Starkova J']","['CLIP - Childhood Leukaemia Investigation Prague, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Second Faculty of Medicine, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Bioenergetics, Institute of Physiology of the Czech Academy of Sciences, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'CLIP - Childhood Leukaemia Investigation Prague, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Second Faculty of Medicine, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'CLIP - Childhood Leukaemia Investigation Prague, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Second Faculty of Medicine, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'CLIP - Childhood Leukaemia Investigation Prague, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Second Faculty of Medicine, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'CLIP - Childhood Leukaemia Investigation Prague, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Second Faculty of Medicine, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'CLIP - Childhood Leukaemia Investigation Prague, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Second Faculty of Medicine, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'CLIP - Childhood Leukaemia Investigation Prague, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Second Faculty of Medicine, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'University Hospital Motol, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Bioenergetics, Institute of Physiology of the Czech Academy of Sciences, Prague, Czech Republic.', ""Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, National Institute of Children's Diseases and Medical Faculty, Comenius University, Bratislava, Slovakia."", 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Second Faculty of Medicine, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'University Hospital Motol, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'CLIP - Childhood Leukaemia Investigation Prague, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Second Faculty of Medicine, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'University Hospital Motol, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'CLIP - Childhood Leukaemia Investigation Prague, Prague, Czech Republic. julia.starkova@lfmotol.cuni.cz.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Second Faculty of Medicine, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic. julia.starkova@lfmotol.cuni.cz.']",['eng'],"['NV18-07-00129/Ministerstvo Zdravotnictvi Ceske Republiky', '16-12726S/Grantova Agentura Ceske Republiky']",['Journal Article'],20200605,England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Biosynthetic Pathways/drug effects', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Glycolysis/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Metabolome/drug effects', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/metabolism', 'Oxidative Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",PMC7275298,['NOTNLM'],"['L-asparaginase', 'cancer metabolism', 'fatty acid oxidation', 'glycolysis', 'leukemia', 'mitochondrial membrane potential', 'mitochondrial respiration', 'resistance']",2020/06/07 06:00,2021/01/20 06:00,['2020/06/07 06:00'],"['2020/04/27 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/06/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/20 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12885-020-07020-y [doi]', '10.1186/s12885-020-07020-y [pii]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2020 Jun 5;20(1):526. doi: 10.1186/s12885-020-07020-y.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the most common acute leukemia in adults and the role of MRD in AML is still emerging. Prognostic markers are complex, largely based upon genetic and cytogenetic aberrations. MRD is now being incorporated into prognostic models and is a powerful predictor of relapse. While PCR-based MRD methods are sensitive and specific, many patients do not have an identifiable molecular marker. Immunophenotypic MRD methods using multiparametric flow cytometry (MFC) are widely applicable, and are based on the identification of surface marker combinations that are present on leukemic cells but not normal hematopoietic cells. Current techniques include a ""different from normal"" and/or a ""leukemia-associated immunophenotype"" approach. Limitations of MFC-based MRD analyses include the lack of standardization, the reliance on a high-quality marrow aspirate, and variable sensitivity. Emerging techniques that look to improve the detection of leukemic cells use dimensional reduction analysis, incorporating more leukemia specific markers and identifying leukemic stem cells. This review will discuss current methods together with new and emerging techniques to determine the role of MFC MRD analysis.","['Dix, Caroline', 'Lo, Tsun-Ho', 'Clark, Georgina', 'Abadir, Edward']","['Dix C', 'Lo TH', 'Clark G', 'Abadir E']","['Institute of Haematology, Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Camperdown, NSW 2050, Australia.', 'Dendritic Cell Research, ANZAC Research Institute, Concord, NSW 2139, Australia.', ""Immunology, Sydpath, St Vincent's Hospital, Darlinghurst, NSW 2010, Australia."", 'Dendritic Cell Research, ANZAC Research Institute, Concord, NSW 2139, Australia.', 'Faculty of Medicine and Health, The University of Sydney, Camperdown, NSW 2039, Australia.', 'Institute of Haematology, Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Camperdown, NSW 2050, Australia.', 'Dendritic Cell Research, ANZAC Research Institute, Concord, NSW 2139, Australia.', 'Faculty of Medicine and Health, The University of Sydney, Camperdown, NSW 2039, Australia.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200603,Switzerland,J Clin Med,Journal of clinical medicine,101606588,,,,PMC7357042,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'immunophenotype', 'measurable residual disease (MRD)']",2020/06/07 06:00,2020/06/07 06:01,['2020/06/07 06:00'],"['2020/05/11 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/26 00:00 [revised]', '2020/05/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/06/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/07 06:01 [medline]']","['jcm9061714 [pii]', '10.3390/jcm9061714 [doi]']",epublish,J Clin Med. 2020 Jun 3;9(6). pii: jcm9061714. doi: 10.3390/jcm9061714.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One crucial cause of relapse is the existence of leukemia stem cells (LSCs) with self-renewal ability, which contribute to repeated treatment resistance and recurrence. Treatments targeting LSCs, especially in combination with existing chemotherapy regimens or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation might help achieve a higher complete remission rate and improve overall survival. Many novel agents of different therapeutic strategies that aim to modulate LSCs self-renewal, proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation are under investigation. In this review, we summarize the latest advances of different therapies in development based on the biological characteristics of LSCs, with particular attention on natural products, synthetic compounds, antibody therapies, and adoptive cell therapies that promote the LSC eradication. We also explore the causes of AML recurrence and proposed potential strategies with new dimensions for targeting LSCs in the future.","['Tan, Yuxin', 'Wu, Qiuji', 'Zhou, Fuling']","['Tan Y', 'Wu Q', 'Zhou F']","[""Department of Hematology, Zhongnan Hospital, Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, 430071, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Radiation and Medical Oncology, Zhongnan Hospital, Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, 430071, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Zhongnan Hospital, Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, 430071, People's Republic of China.

A wide range of tropism, plus to the ability to integrate genes into target cells, made LVs an armamentarium in gene therapy. The third and fourth generations of self-inactivating LVs are being used to achieve safe gene therapy. Not only advanced methods enabled the clinical-grade LV production on a large scale, but also considerably heightened transduction efficiency. One of which is microfluidic systems that revolutionized gene delivery approaches. Since gene therapy using LVs attracted lots of attention to itself, we provided a brief review of LV structure and life-cycle along with methods for improving both LV production and transduction.

How the timing of acquisition of these mutations and their impact on transformation and the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment occurs has only recently begun to be investigated. We show that constitutive and early loss of the epigenetic regulator, TET2, when combined with constitutive activation of FLT3, results in transformation of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia-like or myeloproliferative neoplasm-like phenotype to AML, which is more pronounced in double-mutant mice relative to mice carrying mutations in single genes. Furthermore, we show that in preleukemic and leukemic mice there are alterations in the BM niche and secreted cytokines, which creates a permissive environment for the growth of mutation-bearing cells relative to normal cells.","['Ramdas, Baskar', 'Mali, Raghuveer Singh', 'Palam, Lakshmi Reddy', 'Pandey, Ruchi', 'Cai, Zhigang', 'Pasupuleti, Santhosh Kumar', 'Burns, Sarah S', 'Kapur, Reuben']","['Ramdas B', 'Mali RS', 'Palam LR', 'Pandey R', 'Cai Z', 'Pasupuleti SK', 'Burns SS', 'Kapur R']","['Department of Pediatrics, Herman B.

Here, we studied the expression levels of the immunogenic antigens PRAME (preferentially expressed antigen of melanoma), WT1 (Wilms' tumor gene), and PR3 (proteinase 3) on myeloid blasts by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and correlated these data to the state and course of disease and to the defined subgroups of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). At first diagnoses, 41 of 47 patients tested showed overexpression of PRAME (87%), 38 of WT1 (81%), and 26 of PR3 (55%), with the highest expression levels for PRAME (2048-fold), followed by WT1 (486-fold) and PR3 (196-fold). Thereby, with 70%, the most frequent combination at first diagnoses was detected to be PRAME and WT1 (33/47 patients). Overall, 21 patients (45%) revealed overexpression for all 3 TAAs. Moreover, the highest expression levels of PRAME were found to be correlated with the FAB subtype M5, cytogenetic unfavorable risk groups, and AMLs arising from myelodysplasia (secondary AML; P=0.02). To compare TAA expression levels in the course of disease, expression data were calculatory adjusted to 100% blasts, revealing a relative increase in the PRAME expression levels during the course of persistent disease (3/4 cases). Independent of stage of disease, by trend, higher TAA expression levels were found on blasts derived from peripheral blood than those derived from the bone marrow. In conclusion, it is suggested that vaccine strategies for cancer immunotherapy should comprise different TAA peptides anticipating the diverse TAA expression levels on blasts evolving during the course of disease or treatment.","['Steger, Brigitte', 'Floro, Lajos', 'Amberger, Daniel C', 'Kroell, Tanja', 'Tischer, Johanna', 'Kolb, Hans-Jochem', 'Schmetzer, Helga Maria']","['Steger B', 'Floro L', 'Amberger DC', 'Kroell T', 'Tischer J', 'Kolb HJ', 'Schmetzer HM']","['Helmholtz Center Munich, German Research Center for Environmental Health.', 'Med III, Department for Haematopoietic Transplantations, Grosshadern Clinic, University of Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'Helmholtz Center Munich, German Research Center for Environmental Health.', 'Med III, Department for Haematopoietic Transplantations, Grosshadern Clinic, University of Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'Med III, Department for Haematopoietic Transplantations, Grosshadern Clinic, University of Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'Med III, Department for Haematopoietic Transplantations, Grosshadern Clinic, University of Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'Med III, Department for Haematopoietic Transplantations, Grosshadern Clinic, University of Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'Helmholtz Center Munich, German Research Center for Environmental Health.', 'Med III, Department for Haematopoietic Transplantations, Grosshadern Clinic, University of Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'Helmholtz Center Munich, German Research Center for Environmental Health.', 'Med III, Department for Haematopoietic Transplantations, Grosshadern Clinic, University of Munich, Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Immunother,"Journal of immunotherapy (Hagerstown, Md. : 1997)",9706083,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (PRAME protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)', '0 (WT1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.- (Peptide Hydrolases)']",IM,"['Antigens, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Disease Management', 'Female', '*Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*genetics/therapy', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Peptide Hydrolases/*genetics', 'Prognosis', '*RNA, Messenger', 'Retrospective Studies', 'WT1 Proteins/*genetics']",,,,2020/06/06 06:00,2021/07/23 06:00,['2020/06/06 06:00'],"['2020/06/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/23 06:00 [medline]', '2020/06/06 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/CJI.0000000000000322 [doi]', '00002371-202007000-00004 [pii]']",ppublish,J Immunother. 2020 Jul/Aug;43(6):204-215. doi: 10.1097/CJI.0000000000000322.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, prognostic models and comorbidity indices are important tools to estimate survival and to guide clinicians in individualising treatment. In this nationwide population-based study, we assess comorbidities and for the first time validate comorbidity indices in CMML. We also compare the prognostic power of: the revised International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS-R), CMML-specific prognostic scoring system (CPSS), MD Anderson Prognostic Scoring System (MDAPS) and Mayo score. In this cohort of 337 patients with CMML, diagnosed between 2009 and 2015, the median overall survival was 21.3 months. Autoimmune conditions were present in 25% of the patients, with polymyalgia rheumatica and Hashimoto's thyroiditis being most common. Of the tested comorbidity indices: the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), Haematopoietic cell transplantation-specific Comorbidity Index (HCT-CI) and Myelodysplastic Syndrome-Specific Comorbidity Index (MDS-CI), CCI had the highest C-index (0.62) and was the only comorbidity index independently associated with survival in multivariable analyses. When comparing the prognostic power of the scoring systems, the CPSS had the highest C-index (0.69). In conclusion, using 'real-world' data we found that the CCI and CPSS have the best prognostic power and that autoimmune conditions are overrepresented in CMML.","['Moreno Berggren, Daniel', 'Kjellander, Matilda', 'Backlund, Ellen', 'Engvall, Marie', 'Garelius, Hege', 'Lorenz, Fryderyk', 'Nilsson, Lars', 'Rasmussen, Bengt', 'Lehmann, Soren', 'Hellstrom-Lindberg, Eva', 'Jadersten, Martin', 'Ungerstedt, Johanna', 'Ejerblad, Elisabeth']","['Moreno Berggren D', 'Kjellander M', 'Backlund E', 'Engvall M', 'Garelius H', 'Lorenz F', 'Nilsson L', 'Rasmussen B', 'Lehmann S', 'Hellstrom-Lindberg E', 'Jadersten M', 'Ungerstedt J', 'Ejerblad E']","['Department of Medical Science, Section of Hematology, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.', 'Center for Hematology and Regenerative Medicine, Department of Medicine Huddinge, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital and PO Hematology, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Medical Science, Section of Hematology, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.', 'Department of Immunology, Genetics and Pathology, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.', 'Section for Haematology and Coagulation, Department of Medicine, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Department of Radiation Sciences, Oncology, Umea University, Umea, Sweden.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Radiation Physics, Skane University Hospital, Lund, Sweden.', 'School of Medical Sciences, Orebro University Hospital, Orebro, Sweden.', 'Department of Medical Science, Section of Hematology, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.', 'Center for Hematology and Regenerative Medicine, Department of Medicine Huddinge, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital and PO Hematology, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Center for Hematology and Regenerative Medicine, Department of Medicine Huddinge, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital and PO Hematology, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Center for Hematology and Regenerative Medicine, Department of Medicine Huddinge, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital and PO Hematology, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Medical Science, Section of Hematology, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200605,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Comorbidity', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/*diagnosis/epidemiology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Analysis']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*CMML-specific prognostic scoring system (CPSS)', '*chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML)', '*comorbidity index', '*population-based study', '*prognostic scores']",2020/06/06 06:00,2021/06/23 06:00,['2020/06/06 06:00'],"['2020/03/06 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/23 06:00 [medline]', '2020/06/06 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/bjh.16790 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2021 Feb;192(3):474-483. doi: 10.1111/bjh.16790.

These compounds have dramatically changed the natural history of the disease. RECENT FINDINGS: However, with the array of effective therapies commercially available, the challenge is to define tailored treatment strategies able to realize a balance between treatment efficacy and toxicity or tolerance. New algorithms of treatment are being developed, and it appears that minimal residual disease (MRD) directed therapy will become the norm in the future. Clinical trials are looking at various combinations of novel therapies given with a defined, fixed-period of treatment based on MRD analysis. This approach enables patients to have a period of treatment-free remission instead of continuous therapy. In this review, we summarize this evolution of targeted therapies in CLL.","['Gianfelici, Valentina', 'Levato, Luciano', 'Molica, Stefano']","['Gianfelici V', 'Levato L', 'Molica S']","['Department Hematology-Oncology, Azienda Ospedaliera Pugliese-Ciaccio, 88100, Catanzaro, Italy.', 'Department Hematology-Oncology, Azienda Ospedaliera Pugliese-Ciaccio, 88100, Catanzaro, Italy.', 'Department Hematology-Oncology, Azienda Ospedaliera Pugliese-Ciaccio, 88100, Catanzaro, Italy. smolica@libero.it.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Curr Hematol Malig Rep,Current hematologic malignancy reports,101262565,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '1X70OSD4VX (ibrutinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (BTK protein, human)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",IM,"['Adenine/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/genetics/immunology/mortality', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy/adverse effects/mortality/*trends', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Piperidines/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Treatment Outcome']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*B cell receptor inhibitors', '*Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia', '*Combination strategies', '*Indefinite treatment', '*Time-fixed therapy', '*Venetoclax']",2020/06/06 06:00,2020/12/22 06:00,['2020/06/06 06:00'],"['2020/06/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/22 06:00 [medline]', '2020/06/06 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s11899-020-00586-1 [doi]', '10.1007/s11899-020-00586-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Hematol Malig Rep. 2020 Aug;15(4):343-349. doi: 10.1007/s11899-020-00586-1.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Peak expansion and persistence are correlated with response rates and severity of side effects. However, no standardized method or commercially assay for CD19-CAR measurement is established yet. In this study, two primer-probe assays for digital-droplet PCR (ddPCR) were designed and subsequently explored on 54 samples collected from seven patients after CD19-CAR treatment with axi-cel over time. Detection and quantification of CAR-T-cells were feasible and reliable for all patients included. Peak expansion measured with our assay significantly correlated with the grade of neurologic adverse events but not with cytokine release syndrome. All patients with loss of CAR-signal eventually had disease progression.

In addition, circHIPK3 may also serve as a potential biomarker, to help us know more about the rules of occurrence and development of cancers. In recent studies, many circHIPK3-related cancers have been identified, including nasopharyngeal carcinoma, gallbladder cancer, lung cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, osteosarcoma, glioma, colorectal cancer, ovarian cancer, bladder cancer, prostate cancer, gastric cancer, oral squamous cell carcinoma, and chronic myeloid leukemia. This review summarizes recent studies on the biological mechanisms of circHIPK3 and expounds the molecular mechanisms of circHIPK3 in these malignant tumors.","['Wen, Jingyuan', 'Liao, Jingyu', 'Liang, Junnan', 'Chen, Xiao-Ping', 'Zhang, Bixiang', 'Chu, Liang']","['Wen J', 'Liao J', 'Liang J', 'Chen XP', 'Zhang B', 'Chu L']","['Hepatic Surgery Center, Tongji Medical College, Tongji Hospital, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Hepatic Surgery Center, Tongji Medical College, Tongji Hospital, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Hepatic Surgery Center, Tongji Medical College, Tongji Hospital, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Hepatic Surgery Center, Tongji Medical College, Tongji Hospital, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Hepatic Surgery Center, Tongji Medical College, Tongji Hospital, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Hepatic Surgery Center, Tongji Medical College, Tongji Hospital, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200515,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,,PMC7242753,['NOTNLM'],"['biomarker', 'cancer', 'circHIPK3', 'circular RNA', 'mRNA splicing', 'miRNA sponge']",2020/06/06 06:00,2020/06/06 06:01,['2020/06/06 06:00'],"['2020/01/31 00:00 [received]', '2020/04/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/06/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/06 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2020.00773 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2020 May 15;10:773. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2020.00773. eCollection 2020.,,,"['Copyright (c) 2020 Wen, Liao, Liang, Chen, Zhang and Chu.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Human genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs) were reconstructed within systems biology to study the biochemistry occurring in human cells. However, the complexity of these networks hinders a consistent and concise physiological representation. We present here redHUMAN, a workflow for reconstructing reduced models that focus on parts of the metabolism relevant to a specific physiology using the recently established methods redGEM and lumpGEM. The reductions include the thermodynamic properties of compounds and reactions guaranteeing the consistency of predictions with the bioenergetics of the cell. We introduce a method (redGEMX) to incorporate the pathways used by cells to adapt to the medium. We provide the thermodynamic curation of the human GEMs Recon2 and Recon3D and we apply the redHUMAN workflow to derive leukemia-specific reduced models. The reduced models are powerful platforms for studying metabolic differences between phenotypes, such as diseased and healthy cells.","['Masid, Maria', 'Ataman, Meric', 'Hatzimanikatis, Vassily']","['Masid M', 'Ataman M', 'Hatzimanikatis V']","['Laboratory of Computational Systems Biotechnology, Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne (EPFL), Lausanne, Switzerland.', 'Computational and Systems Biology, Biozentrum, University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Laboratory of Computational Systems Biotechnology, Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne (EPFL), Lausanne, Switzerland. vassily.hatzimanikatis@epfl.ch.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200604,England,Nat Commun,Nature communications,101528555,['0 (Culture Media)'],IM,"['Biomass', 'Biosynthetic Pathways', 'Culture Media', '*Genome, Human', 'Humans', 'Metabolic Networks and Pathways/genetics', 'Metabolism/*genetics', '*Models, Biological', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Statistics as Topic', 'Thermodynamics']",PMC7272419,,,2020/06/06 06:00,2020/08/19 06:00,['2020/06/06 06:00'],"['2019/09/23 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/06/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/19 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41467-020-16549-2 [doi]', '10.1038/s41467-020-16549-2 [pii]']",epublish,Nat Commun. 2020 Jun 4;11(1):2821. doi: 10.1038/s41467-020-16549-2.,"['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6470-5083', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7942-9226', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6432-4694']",,,['Nat Commun. 2020 Jul 23;11(1):3757.

This approach, as a simple method for the exfoliation and fragmentation of graphite in a nanocluster solution, enabled us to produce stable aqueous graphene dispersions at low cost and without the need for hazardous chemicals or tedious experimental procedures. In this method, Hb@AuNCs were used not only as stabilizing agent of graphene through non-covalent bonding, but also as dispersing agent of few-layer graphene nanosheets. The Hb@AuNCs stabilized graphene (Hb@AuNCs-G) was characterized by high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), zeta-sizer and Raman spectroscopy. Then, the graphene nanosheets were applied as a novel versatile electrochemical platform for ultrasensitive biosensing of short DNA species of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) based on the ""signal off"" and ""signal on"" strategies. For this purpose, a single strand DNA (ssDNA) was immobilized on the Hb@AuNCs-G/AuNPs modified electrode surface and acted as the biorecognition element. Methylene blue (MB), as the signaling probe, was then intercalated into the ssDNA. The intercalated MB was liberated upon interaction with the synthetic complementary DNA (cDNA, target), thereby resulting in the apparent reduction of MB redox signal. This designed ""signal off"" sensing system enabled the voltammetric determination of the target cDNA over a dynamic linear range (DLR) of 0.1 fM to 10 pM with a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.037 fM. In the ""signal on"" strategy, the response to the cDNA was detected by monitoring the change in the electron transfer resistance (Rct) using the ferro/ferricyanide system as a redox probe. The charge transfer resistance of the probe was found to increase linearly with increasing concentration of target cDNA in the range of 0.1 fM-10 pM with a limit of detection of 0.030 fM. Finally, the selectivity and feasibility of genosensor was evaluated by the analysis of derived nucleotides from mismatched sequences and the clinical samples of patients with leukemia as real samples, respectively.","['Shamsipur, Mojtaba', 'Samandari, Leila', 'Farzin, Leila', 'Molaabasi, Fatemeh', 'Mousazadeh, Mohammad Hasan']","['Shamsipur M', 'Samandari L', 'Farzin L', 'Molaabasi F', 'Mousazadeh MH']","['Department of Chemistry, Razi University, Kermanshah, Iran.

It usually manifests as a perianal mass, with redness/swelling, heat, and pain, and can affect physical and mental health in severe cases. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of matrine sitz bath (MSB) in treating perianal infection after chemotherapy for acute leukemia. METHODS: A total of 216 acute leukemia patients with perianal infection that developed during chemotherapy were enrolled in this study and equally randomized into an MSB group and control group. The control group was treated with the conventional potassium permanganate sitz bath. After 14 days of treatment, the clinical efficacy and symptom/sign scores were compared between these 2 groups. The serum levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-10(IL-10), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) were detected by using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RESULTS: The clinical efficacy of MSB group was significantly superior to that of the control group (P<0.05). The scores of anal pain, systemic symptoms, mass size, and mass texture were significantly decreased after treatment in both groups (P<0.05), and they were significantly lower in the MSB group than in the control group (P<0.05). After treatment, the serum levels of hs-CRP, TNF-alpha, ESR, and PGE2 in these 2 groups significantly dropped (P<0.05), and they were significantly lower in the MSB group than in the control group (P<0.05); IL-10 level significantly rose in both groups (P<0.05), and it was significantly higher in the MSB group than in the control group (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: MSB is effective in treating perianal infection after chemotherapy for acute leukemia as it can effectively improve symptoms and signs and alleviate inflammatory reactions.","['Zhou, Ye', 'Gao, Huaqiang', 'Hua, Haiying', 'Zhu, Wenyan', 'Wang, Zhiqing', 'Zhang, Ye', 'Wu, Shuang', 'Li, Jin', 'Zhao, Ying', 'Xue, Lili']","['Zhou Y', 'Gao H', 'Hua H', 'Zhu W', 'Wang Z', 'Zhang Y', 'Wu S', 'Li J', 'Zhao Y', 'Xue L']","['Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hospital of Jiangnan University, Wuxi 214041, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hospital of Jiangnan University, Wuxi 214041, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hospital of Jiangnan University, Wuxi 214041, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hospital of Jiangnan University, Wuxi 214041, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hospital of Jiangnan University, Wuxi 214041, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hospital of Jiangnan University, Wuxi 214041, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hospital of Jiangnan University, Wuxi 214041, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hospital of Jiangnan University, Wuxi 214041, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hospital of Jiangnan University, Wuxi 214041, China.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Wuxi Maternity and Child Health Hospital, Wuxi 214002, China. 706512989@qq.com.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",,China,Ann Palliat Med,Annals of palliative medicine,101585484,"['0 (Alkaloids)', '0 (Quinolizines)', 'N390W430AC (matrine)']",IM,"['*Alkaloids/therapeutic use', 'Humans', '*Leukemia/drug therapy', 'Quinolizines/therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Matrine', 'acute leukemia', 'perianal infection', 'sitz bath']",2020/06/06 06:00,2021/05/15 06:00,['2020/06/06 06:00'],"['2020/02/29 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/06/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.21037/apm-20-912 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Palliat Med. 2020 May;9(3):1109-1116. doi: 10.21037/apm-20-912.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The diagnosis may be delayed owing to non-specific symptoms and the need for special diagnostic modalities. CASE: A 70-year-old man in his sixth year of remission from acute myeloid leukemia was referred to the pain clinic for shooting and radiating pain in the left posterior leg. A lumbar spine magnetic resonance imaging showed mild disc bulging of the L2-3, which was insufficient to explain the patient's symptoms. With insufficient pain response to lumbar epidural block and piriformis injection, we examined both sciatic nerves using an ultrasound and identified an enlarged hypoechoic mass on the left sciatic nerve at mid-thigh level. After that, we biopsied the mass under general anesthesia, and histology confirmed it to be neuroleukemiosis. CONCLUSIONS: Ultrasound is an inexpensive, non-invasive, simple, and quick diagnostic modality that can be used as a screening tool in the diagnosis of neuroleukemiosis.","['Baek, Soon Ju', 'Lee, Jung Woong', 'Chung, Sukyung', 'Choi, Shu Chung', 'Chon, Jin Young']","['Baek SJ', 'Lee JW', 'Chung S', 'Choi SC', 'Chon JY']","['Department of Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],,['Case Reports'],20200605,Korea (South),Korean J Anesthesiol,Korean journal of anesthesiology,101502451,"['0 (Contrast Media)', 'AU0V1LM3JT (Gadolinium)']",IM,"['Aged', '*Contrast Media', 'Gadolinium', 'Humans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', '*Positron Emission Tomography Computed Tomography', 'Ultrasonography']",PMC7862943,['NOTNLM'],"['*Complications', '*Diagnosis', '*Extramedullary myeloid cell tumor', '*Leukemia', '*Neoplastic', '*Ultrasonography']",2020/06/06 06:00,2021/11/10 06:00,['2020/06/06 06:00'],"['2020/03/22 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/10 06:00 [medline]', '2020/06/06 06:00 [entrez]']","['kja.20128 [pii]', '10.4097/kja.20128 [doi]']",ppublish,Korean J Anesthesiol. 2021 Feb;74(1):65-69. doi: 10.4097/kja.20128.

This programmed course is closely related to the translocation t(9;22)(q22;q11) and the resulting BCR-ABL1 fusion protein (p210) that drives the leukemic transformation of hematopoietic stem cells. Therefore, the cure of CML can only pass through the abrogation of the Ph+ clone. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) and interferon-alpha (IFNalpha) have been proven to reduce the Ph+ clone in a limited proportion of CML population and this translated in a lower rate of progression to BP and in a significant prolongation of survival. Tyrosine-kinase inhibitors (TKIs), lastly introduced in 2000, by preventing the disease blastic transformation and significantly prolonging the survival in up to 90% of the patient population, radically changed the fate of CML. The current therapy with TKIs induces a chronicization of the disease but several criticisms still persist, and the most relevant one is the sustainability of long-term therapy with TKIs in terms of compliance, toxicity and costs. The perspectives concern the optimization of therapy according to the age, the risk of disease, the potency and the safety profiles of the TKIs. The prolongation of survival is the most important end point which should be guaranteed to all patients. The treatment free remission (TFR) is the new goal that we would like to give to an increasing number of patients. The cure remains the main objective of CML therapy.","['Russo, Domenico', 'Garcia-Gutierrez, Jose Valentin', 'Soverini, Simona', 'Baccarani, Michele']","['Russo D', 'Garcia-Gutierrez JV', 'Soverini S', 'Baccarani M']","['Chair of Hematology, Unit of Blood Diseases and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Department of Clinical and Experimental Sciences, University of Brescia, ASST-Spedali Civili, 25100 Brescia, Italy.', 'Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital Universitario Ramon y Cajal, IRYCIS, 28034 Madrid, Spain.', 'Institute of Hematology ""Lorenzo e Ariosto Seragnoli"", University of Bologna, 40138 Bologna, Italy.', 'Institute of Hematology ""Lorenzo e Ariosto Seragnoli"", University of Bologna, 40138 Bologna, Italy.']",['eng'],,['Editorial'],20200602,Switzerland,J Clin Med,Journal of clinical medicine,101606588,,,,PMC7357035,['NOTNLM'],"['MRD monitoring', 'NGS mutation', 'digital PCR', 'prognosis', 'quantitative PCR', 'therapy guidelines', 'treatment de-escalation', 'treatment free remission', 'tyrosine kinase inhibitor']",2020/06/06 06:00,2020/06/06 06:01,['2020/06/06 06:00'],"['2020/05/22 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/06/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/06 06:01 [medline]']","['jcm9061709 [pii]', '10.3390/jcm9061709 [doi]']",epublish,J Clin Med. 2020 Jun 2;9(6). pii: jcm9061709. doi: 10.3390/jcm9061709.,,"['DR: MSD, Novartis, Gilead: Speaker Honoraria; MSD, Janssen, Gilead: advisory', 'committees VGG: Novartis, BMS, Pfizer, Incyte Biosciences: Speaker Honoraria,', 'advisory committees SS: Incyte Biosciences: consultancy and Speaker Honoraria MB:', 'Novartis, Incyte, Fusion Pharma, Takeda: Consultant receiving honoraria.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To optimize further the utility of our developed peptides for targeted therapy in cancer cells using the redox condition, we designed a new generation of peptides and evaluated their cytotoxicity as well as uptake behavior against different cancer cell lines. Thus, cyclic [C(WR)xC] and linear counterparts (C(WR)xC), where x = 4-5, were synthesized using Fmoc/tBu solid-phase peptide synthesis, purified, and characterized. The compounds did not show any significant cytotoxicity (at 25 microM) against ovarian (SK-OV-3), leukemia (CCRF-CEM), gastric adenocarcinoma (CRL-1739), breast carcinoma (MDA-MB-231), and normal kidney (LLCPK) cells after 24 and 72 h incubation. Both cyclic [C(WR)5C] and linear (C(WR)5C) demonstrated comparable molecular transporter properties versus [WR]5 in the delivery of a phosphopeptide (F'-GpYEEI) in CCRF-CEM cells. The uptake of F'-GpYEEI in the presence of 1,4-dithiothreitol (DTT) as the reducing agent was significantly improved in case of l(C(WR)5C), while it was not changed by [C(WR)5C]. Fluorescence microscopy also demonstrated a significant uptake of F'-GpYEEI in the presence of l(C(WR)5C). Cyclic [C(WR)5C] improved the uptake of the fluorescent-labeled anti-HIV drugs F'-d4T, F'-3TC, and F'-FTC by 3.0-4.9-fold.

A comprehensive search was performed to identify controlled and observational studies conducted through August 2017. Eighteen unique studies were included: breast cancer (n = 2), gastric cancer (n = 1), exocrine pancreatic cancer (n = 1), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (n = 1), prostate cancer (n = 7) and colorectal cancer (n = 6). An additional 13 studies that focused on fish intake or at-risk populations were summarized to increase readers' understanding of the topic based on this review, DHA and EPA interact with certain genetic variants to decrease breast, colorectal and prostate cancer risk, although data was limited and identified polymorphisms were heterogeneous. The evidence to date demonstrates that omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 LC-PUFA) may decrease cancer risk by affecting genetic variants of inflammatory pathways, oxidative stress and tumor apoptosis. Collectively, data supports the notion that once a genetic variant is identified, the benefits of a targeted, personalized therapeutic regimen that includes DHA and/or EPA should be considered.","['Yurko-Mauro, Karin', 'Van Elswyk, Mary', 'Teo, Lynn']","['Yurko-Mauro K', 'Van Elswyk M', 'Teo L']","['Pharma Segment, DSM Nutritional Products, Columbia, MD 21045, USA.', 'Van Elswyk Consulting, Inc., Clark, CO 80428, USA.', 'Teo Research Consulting, Silver Spring, MD 20910, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200602,Switzerland,Nutrients,Nutrients,101521595,"['25167-62-8 (Docosahexaenoic Acids)', 'AAN7QOV9EA (Eicosapentaenoic Acid)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/genetics', 'Docosahexaenoic Acids/*administration & dosage', 'Eicosapentaenoic Acid/*administration & dosage', '*Genetic Variation', 'Humans', 'Inflammation/genetics', 'Neoplasms/*genetics/*prevention & control/therapy', 'Oxidative Stress/genetics', 'Precision Medicine', 'Risk']",PMC7352171,['NOTNLM'],"['cancer', 'docosahexaenoic acid', 'eicosapentaenoic acid', 'genes', 'genetic variation', 'genotype', 'omega-3', 'polyunsaturated fatty acids', 'scoping review']",2020/06/06 06:00,2021/02/25 06:00,['2020/06/06 06:00'],"['2020/04/03 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/26 00:00 [revised]', '2020/05/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/06/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/25 06:00 [medline]']","['nu12061647 [pii]', '10.3390/nu12061647 [doi]']",epublish,Nutrients. 2020 Jun 2;12(6). pii: nu12061647. doi: 10.3390/nu12061647.,,"['K.Y.M. was an employee of DSM Nutritional Products.

Biochemical and biophysical tests showed that compounds 23a,b and 37 are nanomolar inhibitors of both target proteins. Detailed structure-activity relationships were deduced for the synthesized inhibitors which were supported by extensive docking and molecular dynamics studies. Cellular testing in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells showed only a weak effect, most probably because of the poor permeability of the inhibitors.

An increasing amount of reports have linked implants to the rare anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL). Other implant-related lymphomas, such as those of B-cell lineage, are much rarer. PRESENTATION OF CASE: A 62-year-old female presented with pain and Baker grade III capsular contraction of the right breast. Subpectorally placed textured anatomical implants had been in situ for 26 years after cosmetic augmentation. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) showed bilateral implant leakage. Explantation of both implants confirmed bilateral leakage after which symptoms went into remission. Three months later our patient noticed an erythematous area, scar swelling and serous fluid leakage on the lateral side of the inframammary fold of the right breast. Siliconomas were excised bilaterally together with a partial capsulectomy on the left. Histopathology and immunohistochemical analysis showed monotonous small cell B-lymphocytic infiltration (CD20+, CD5+, CD23+, ALK-) in both capsules, highly suggestive for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL). DISCUSSION: CLL/SLL are classified as nearly the same disease. The primary difference is the localization; CLL is found the bone marrow and blood whereas SLL is predominantly in the lymph nodes and spleen. There are no previous descriptions of bilateral CLL/SLL found in periprosthetic capsules. CONCLUSION: Breast implants are increasingly linked to various malignancies. In most cases, including our patient, implant explantation together with long-term follow-up suffices. MRI yields additional value in early stage diagnosis. More research is required to further optimize multidisciplinary care and improve patient outcomes.","['Bletsis, Patrick P', 'Janssen, Laura E', 'Visser, Otto', 'Offerman, Saskia R', 'Tellier, Michiel A', 'Laterveer, Laurens', 'Houpt, Peter']","['Bletsis PP', 'Janssen LE', 'Visser O', 'Offerman SR', 'Tellier MA', 'Laterveer L', 'Houpt P']","['Faculty of Medical Sciences, University of Groningen, Groningen, the Netherlands; Department of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, Isala Clinics, Zwolle, the Netherlands.

The temperature limit defining fever used clinically varies. A higher limit can avoid unnecessary diagnoses in patients spontaneously recovering from fever. This trial primarily aimed to determine if a limit of 39.0 degrees C ear temperature is non-inferior to 38.5 degrees C regarding safety. METHODS: This cluster-randomised, multiple crossover, non-blinded, non-inferiority trial was done in six Swiss Paediatric Oncology Group centres (clusters) in Switzerland. Patients (aged 1 to <18 years) with any malignancy and treated with myelosuppressive chemotherapy expected to last 2 months or more were repeatedly randomly assigned (1:1), at the cluster level, to either monthly 39.0 degrees C or 38.5 degrees C ear temperature limits for diagnosis of fever in neutropenia. Diagnosis below the randomised limit was allowed for clinical reasons. Such a diagnosis implied emergency hospitalisation, examinations (including blood culture), as-needed antipyretics, and empirical intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotics. The primary outcome was the rate of fever in neutropenia with safety relevant events (SRE) per chemotherapy year; we also assessed efficacy in terms of rate of fever in neutropenia. The non-inferiority margin was 1.33 for safety, and for effiacy, the superiority margin was 1.00. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02324231. FINDINGS: 269 patients were recruited between April 28, 2016, to Aug 27, 2018, until the trial was stopped for success after the second interim analysis. Patients were repeatedly randomly assigned, with 1210 (48%) of 2547 randomisation periods and 92 (47%) of 195 chemotherapy years randomised to 39.0 degrees C. SREs were diagnosed in 72 (20%) of 360 fever in neutropenia episodes (zero deaths, 16 intensive care unit admissions, 22 cases of severe sepsis, and 56 cases of bacteraemia). In 92 chemotherapy years randomised to the 39.0 degrees C fever limit, 151 episodes of fever with neutropenia were diagnosed (1.64 per year), including 22 (15%) with SRE (0.24 per year). In 103 chemotherapy years randomised to 38.5 degrees C, 209 episodes were diagnosed (2.03 per year), including 50 (24%) with SRE (0.49 per year). The mixed Poisson regression rate ratio (RR) of fever in neutropenia with SRE in 39.0 degrees C versus 38.5 degrees C was 0.56 (95% upper confidence bound 0.72). The corresponding RR of fever in neutropenia was 0.83 (95% upper confidence bound 0.98). INTERPRETATION: In children with neutropenia and chemotherapy for cancer, 39.0 degrees C ear temperature was safe and seemed efficacious. For Switzerland and comparable settings, 39.0 degrees C can be recommended as new evidence-based standard fever limit except for patients with acute myeloid leukaemia or haematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

An adaptive segmentation procedure is performed on peripheral blood smear images to extract the main features (10 geometric features) from the segmented images of white blood cell (WBC), nucleus, and cytoplasm. To show the importance of the different extracted features for the diagnostic accuracy, a comprehensive study is made on all the possible permutation cases of the features using powerful classifiers which are K-nearest neighbor (KNN) at different metric functions, support vector machine (SVM) with different kernels, and artificial neural network (ANN). This procedure enables us to construct a feature map depending only on least number of features which lead to the highest diagnostic accuracy. It is found that the features map regarding the vacuoles in the cytoplasm and the regularity of the nucleus membrane gives the highest accurate results. The automatic classification for ALL subtypes based only on these two effective features is assessed using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and F1 -score measures. It is confirmed that the present technique is highly accurate, and saves the effort and time of training.","['Al-Tahhan, F E', 'Fares, M E', 'Sakr, Ali A', 'Aladle, Doaa A']","['Al-Tahhan FE', 'Fares ME', 'Sakr AA', 'Aladle DA']","['Mathematics Department, Faculty of Science, Mansoura University, Mansoura, Egypt.', 'Mathematics Department, Faculty of Science, Mansoura University, Mansoura, Egypt.', 'Computers and Automatic Control Engineering Department, Faculty of Engineering, KFS University, Kafr Elsheikh, Egypt.', 'Clinical Pathology Department, Faculty of Medicine, Mansoura University, Mansoura, Egypt.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200604,United States,Microsc Res Tech,Microscopy research and technique,9203012,,IM,"['*Algorithms', 'Humans', '*Leukemia', 'Neural Networks, Computer', 'Support Vector Machine']",,['NOTNLM'],"['K-nearest neighbor (KNN)', 'acute lymphatic leukemia (ALL)', 'artificial neural network (ANN)', 'feature selection', 'machine learning (ML)', 'simple feature map', 'support vector machine (SVM)']",2020/06/05 06:00,2021/08/19 06:00,['2020/06/05 06:00'],"['2019/12/11 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/16 00:00 [revised]', '2020/04/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/19 06:00 [medline]', '2020/06/05 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jemt.23509 [doi]'],ppublish,Microsc Res Tech. 2020 Oct;83(10):1178-1189. doi: 10.1002/jemt.23509.

According to guidelines published by the American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, allogeneic HCT should be offered to all intermediate- and high-risk patients with acute leukemia. While matched-related donor (MRD) grafts continue to be the preferred stem cell source for allogeneic HCT, studies comparing MRD grafts to matched-unrelated donor (MUD) grafts showed comparable outcomes in patients with acute leukemia. Unfortunately, for those without a suitable matched-related graft, the probability of finding a suitable matched-unrelated donor varies significantly depending on racial and ethnic background. With allogeneic HCT procedures increasing year after year due to the increased availability of suitable donors, each of these alternative donor sources merits special clinical considerations, specifically with regard to infections. Infections remain a significant cause of morbidity and mortality after allogeneic transplant, especially in those receiving alternative donor grafts. Due to the high-risk nature associated with these donor grafts, it is important to understand the true risk of developing infectious complications. While there are a multitude of infections that have been described in patients post-allogeneic HCT, this review seeks to focus on the incidence of cytomegalovirus (CMV) and invasive fungal infections (IFI) in adult patients receiving alternative donor source transplantation for hematologic malignancies.","['Whited, Laura K', 'Handy, Victoria W', 'Hosing, Chitra', 'Chow, Eric']","['Whited LK', 'Handy VW', 'Hosing C', 'Chow E']","['The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Janssen Scientific Affairs, LLC, Horsham, Pennsylvania, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200721,United States,Pharmacotherapy,Pharmacotherapy,8111305,,IM,"['Adult', 'Cytomegalovirus Infections/epidemiology', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/therapy', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects/methods', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Invasive Fungal Infections/epidemiology', '*Tissue Donors', 'Unrelated Donors']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*alternative donor sources', '*cytomegalovirus', '*fungal', '*haploidentical', '*infections', '*mismatched', '*outcomes', '*transplantation', '*umbilical cord', '*viral']",2020/06/05 06:00,2021/06/04 06:00,['2020/06/05 06:00'],"['2020/06/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/04 06:00 [medline]', '2020/06/05 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/phar.2433 [doi]'],ppublish,Pharmacotherapy. 2020 Aug;40(8):773-787. doi: 10.1002/phar.2433.

Recent reports indicate that ARC also occurs in haematologic malignancies. However, the risk factors for ARC in haematologic malignancies remain unknown, and there is no established method to predict ARC in haematologic malignancies. Our objective was to explore the risk factors for ARC retrospectively and develop a scoring method to predict ARC. METHODS: A single-centre, retrospective, observational cohort study was conducted at the Sendai Medical Center (Sendai, Japan); 133 patients (April 2017-March 2019) and 41 patients (April-November 2019) with haematopoietic tumours who were administered vancomycin were enrolled in the analysis and validation cohorts, respectively. To define ARC, we calculated the vancomycin serum concentration when CLcr = 130 mL/min/1.73 m(2) using a one-compartment model. Patients with ARC were defined as those whose actual concentration of vancomycin remained lower than the calculated concentration. Using the analysis cohort, we explored risk factors of ARC and developed a scoring method to predict ARC in haematologic malignancies. The reproducibility of the scoring system was demonstrated using the validation cohort. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Through multivariate analysis, young age (P < .001), leukaemia (P = .001) and low serum creatinine (P < .001) were identified as risk factors. According to this result, we established the ARC detection method: age </= 50 years = 3 points, 50 years < age </=65 years = 1 point, leukaemia = 2 points, low SCr = 2 points; patients scoring >/= 5 points represent the ARC high-risk group. Using this scoring system, we could detect ARC with a sensitivity and specificity of 60.0% and 89.7% in the analysis cohort and 90.0% and 90.9% in the validation cohort, respectively. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: Our scoring method could predict ARC in haematologic malignancies and is useful as a simple screening tool for ARC.","['Saito, Kazuki', 'Kamio, Satomi', 'Ito, Kanako', 'Suzuki, Norifumi', 'Abe, Kensuke', 'Goto, Tatsuya']","['Saito K', 'Kamio S', 'Ito K', 'Suzuki N', 'Abe K', 'Goto T']","['Department of Pharmacy, National Hospital Organization Sendai Medical Center, Sendai, Japan.', 'Department of Pharmacy, National Hospital Organization Sendai Medical Center, Sendai, Japan.', 'Department of Pharmacy, National Hospital Organization Sendai Medical Center, Sendai, Japan.', 'Department of Pharmacy, National Hospital Organization Sendai Medical Center, Sendai, Japan.', 'Department of Pharmacy, National Hospital Organization Sendai Medical Center, Sendai, Japan.', 'Department of Pharmacy, National Hospital Organization Sendai Medical Center, Sendai, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Observational Study', 'Validation Study']",20200604,England,J Clin Pharm Ther,Journal of clinical pharmacy and therapeutics,8704308,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '6Q205EH1VU (Vancomycin)', 'AYI8EX34EU (Creatinine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/*pharmacokinetics', 'Cohort Studies', 'Creatinine/*blood', 'Critical Illness', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*complications', 'Humans', 'Japan', 'Kidney Function Tests', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Vancomycin/*pharmacokinetics']",,['NOTNLM'],"['augmented renal clearance', 'haematologic malignancies', 'risk factors', 'scoring method']",2020/06/05 06:00,2021/08/11 06:00,['2020/06/05 06:00'],"['2020/03/14 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/02 00:00 [revised]', '2020/05/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/11 06:00 [medline]', '2020/06/05 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/jcpt.13193 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Pharm Ther. 2020 Oct;45(5):1120-1126. doi: 10.1111/jcpt.13193.

This study was aimed to determine the trend of SPBC incidence over time and the risk of developing SPBC in site-specific primary cancer survivors in the United States. The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) 13 registry (1992-2015) was used to identify SPBC patients with previous malignancies. Standardized incidence ratio (SIR) was computed to compare the incidence rates of the observed cases of SPBC in cancer survivors over the expected cases in the general population. Elevated risk of SPBC was observed in women with previous BC (SIR = 1.74) or thyroid cancer (SIR = 1.17). Women with initial skin melanoma in older age (>/=50 years) (SIR = 1.11), or White race (SIR = 1.11) presented an elevated incidence of SPBC than the general female population. Besides, Asian/Pacific Islander (API) women with cancer of corpus uteri, ovary, bladder, or kidney were prone to developing SPBC when compared with the general population, with SIRs of 1.61, 1.35, 1.48, and 1.70, respectively. Male BC patients showed profound risk of developing SPBC (SIR = 34.86). Male leukemia patients also presented elevated risk of developing SPBC (SIR = 2.06). Our study suggests significant increase of SPBC in both sexes in the United States. Elevated risk of SPBC exists in survivors with primary BC, female thyroid cancer, male leukemia, and API female cancer patients with primary genitourinary cancer. Our study is helpful in developing strategies for BC control and prevention on specific first primary cancer survivors with an elevated risk of SPBC.","['Cheng, Yao', 'Huang, Ziming', 'Liao, Qing', 'Yu, Xingchen', 'Jiang, Hongyu', 'He, Yangting', 'Yao, Shuang', 'Nie, Shaofa', 'Liu, Li']","['Cheng Y', 'Huang Z', 'Liao Q', 'Yu X', 'Jiang H', 'He Y', 'Yao S', 'Nie S', 'Liu L']","['Maternal and Child Health Hospital of Hubei Province, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Maternal and Child Health Hospital of Hubei Province, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Ministry of Education Key Lab of Environment and Health, School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Ministry of Education Key Lab of Environment and Health, School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Ministry of Education Key Lab of Environment and Health, School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Ministry of Education Key Lab of Environment and Health, School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Ministry of Education Key Lab of Environment and Health, School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Ministry of Education Key Lab of Environment and Health, School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Ministry of Education Key Lab of Environment and Health, School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200604,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,,IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Breast Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Breast Neoplasms, Male/*epidemiology', '*Cancer Survivors', 'Female', 'Health Services Needs and Demand', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Melanoma/epidemiology', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Hormone-Dependent/epidemiology', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*epidemiology', 'Organ Specificity', 'Racial Groups/statistics & numerical data', 'SEER Program', 'Skin Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Thyroid Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'United States/epidemiology', 'Urogenital Neoplasms/epidemiology']",PMC7272050,,,2020/06/05 06:00,2020/08/15 06:00,['2020/06/05 06:00'],"['2020/01/12 00:00 [received]', '2020/04/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/06/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0232800 [doi]', 'PONE-D-20-00988 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2020 Jun 4;15(6):e0232800. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0232800. eCollection 2020.,,['The authors declare no conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Children with newly diagnosed National Cancer Institute (NCI) high-risk B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (HR B-ALL) or NCI standard-risk B-ALL with defined minimal residual disease thresholds during induction were randomly assigned to receive postinduction IT MTX or ITT. Patients with CNS3-status disease were not eligible. Postinduction IT therapy was given for a total of 21 to 26 doses. Neurocognitive assessments were performed during therapy and during 1 year off therapy. RESULTS: Random assignment was closed to accrual in March 2018 after a futility boundary had been crossed, concluding that ITT could not be shown to be superior to IT MTX. The 5-year postinduction DFS and overall survival rates (+/- SE) of children randomly assigned to IT MTX versus ITT were 93.2% +/- 2.1% v 90.6% +/- 2.3% (P = .85), and 96.3% +/- 1.5% v 96.7% +/- 1.4% (P = .77), respectively. There were no differences in the cumulative incidence of isolated bone marrow relapse, isolated CNS relapse, or combined bone marrow and CNS relapse rates, or in toxicities observed for patients receiving IT MTX compared with ITT. There were no significant differences in neurocognitive outcomes for patients receiving IT MTX compared with ITT. CONCLUSION: Postinduction CNS prophylaxis with ITT did not improve 5-year DFS for children with HR B-ALL. The standard of care for CNS prophylaxis for children with B-ALL and no overt CNS involvement remains IT MTX.","['Salzer, Wanda L', 'Burke, Michael J', 'Devidas, Meenakshi', 'Dai, Yunfeng', 'Hardy, Kristina K', 'Kairalla, John A', 'Gore, Lia', 'Hilden, Joanne M', 'Larsen, Eric', 'Rabin, Karen R', 'Zweidler-McKay, Patrick A', 'Borowitz, Michael J', 'Wood, Brent', 'Heerema, Nyla A', 'Carroll, Andrew J', 'Winick, Naomi', 'Carroll, William L', 'Raetz, Elizabeth A', 'Loh, Mignon L', 'Hunger, Stephen P']","['Salzer WL', 'Burke MJ', 'Devidas M', 'Dai Y', 'Hardy KK', 'Kairalla JA', 'Gore L', 'Hilden JM', 'Larsen E', 'Rabin KR', 'Zweidler-McKay PA', 'Borowitz MJ', 'Wood B', 'Heerema NA', 'Carroll AJ', 'Winick N', 'Carroll WL', 'Raetz EA', 'Loh ML', 'Hunger SP']","['Uniformed Services University, Bethesda, MD.', ""Department of Pediatrics, Children's Hospital of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI."", ""Department of Global Pediatric Medicine, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN."", 'Department of Biostatistics, Colleges of Medicine and Public Health & Health Professions, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL.', ""Children's National Medical Center, Washington, DC."", 'Department of Biostatistics, Colleges of Medicine and Public Health & Health Professions, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL.', ""Department of Pediatrics, Center for Cancer and Blood Disorders, Children's Hospital Colorado, Aurora, CO."", 'University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, CO.', ""Department of Pediatrics, Center for Cancer and Blood Disorders, Children's Hospital Colorado, Aurora, CO."", 'University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, CO.', ""Department of Pediatrics, Maine Children's Cancer Program, Scarborough, ME."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX.', 'ImmunoGen, Inc, Waltham, MA.', 'Department of Pathology, Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, Baltimore, MD.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA.', 'Department of Pathology, The Ohio State University School of Medicine, Columbus, OH.', 'Department of Genetics, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Perlmutter Cancer Center, New York University Langone Medical Center, New York, NY.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Perlmutter Cancer Center, New York University Langone Medical Center, New York, NY.', ""Department of Pediatrics, Benioff Children's Hospital and the Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA."", ""Department of Pediatrics and the Center for Childhood Cancer Research, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA."", 'Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA.']",['eng'],"['U24 CA196173/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA098543/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180899/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180886/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UG1 CA233324/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA098413/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Clinical Trial, Phase III', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200604,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'WI4X0X7BPJ (Hydrocortisone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage', 'Child', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Dexamethasone/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hydrocortisone/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Injections, Spinal', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Nervous System Neoplasms/*prevention & control', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage/adverse effects']",PMC7402996,,,2020/06/05 06:00,2021/02/23 06:00,['2020/06/05 06:00'],"['2020/06/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/23 06:00 [medline]', '2020/06/05 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.19.02892 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2020 Aug 10;38(23):2628-2638. doi: 10.1200/JCO.19.02892.

However, it is not yet clear what happens to this subpopulation of B cells in the early period of infection of animals. PURPOSE: Quantitative characterization of IgM+ and CD5+ B cells during the immune response, which can provide important information on the mechanisms of lymphocyte priming in BLV infection. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The experiment used BLV-negative calves of black-motley breed at the age of 8 months (n = 11). Animals (n = 8) were intravenously injected with blood of a BLV-positive cow. Control calves (n = 3) were injected with saline. Studies were performed before and after infection on days 5, 7, 14, 21, 28 and 65 of the immune response. The determination of the number of B-lymphocytes in the blood was carried out by the method of immunoperoxidase staining based on monoclonal antibodies to IgM, CD5. RESULTS: As a result of the studies, it was found that the level of CD5+ B cells increases on the 14th day of the primary immune response, characterized by polyclonal proliferation of CD5+ B cells, which are the primary target for BLV. Our research data confirm that in the lymphocytes of experimentally infected cattle, surface aggregation of IgM and CD5 molecules on B-lymphocytes is absent. DISCUSSION: It is known that the wave-like nature of IgM synthesis, which was shown in previous studies, depends on a subpopulation of B1 cells. After 7 days of the immune response, IgM+ and CD5+ cells do not correlate, which shows their functional difference. The increase in CD5+ cells is probably not associated with B cells, but with T cells differentiating under the influence of the virus. CONCLUSIONS: A subset of B1 cells is the primary target of cattle leukemia virus. The 65th day of the immune response is characterized by the expansion of IgM+ B cells, a decrease in the number of CD5+ cells and a uniform distribution of receptors around the perimeter of the cells.","['Ezdakova, I Y', 'Kapustina, O V', 'Gulyukin, M I', 'Stepanova, T V']","['Ezdakova IY', 'Kapustina OV', 'Gulyukin MI', 'Stepanova TV']","['All-Russian Scientific and Research Institute of Experimental Veterinary Medicine named after K.I.

We explored the relationship between time from diagnosis to treatment start (TDT) and prognosis in a large real-world data set from the German Study Alliance Leukemia-Acute Myeloid Leukemia (SAL-AML) registry. All registered non-acute promyelocytic leukemia patients with intensive induction treatment and a minimum 12 months of follow-up were selected (n = 2263). We analyzed influence of TDT on remission, early death, and overall survival (OS) in univariable analyses for each day of treatment delay, in groups of 0 to 5, 6 to 10, 11 to 15, and >15 days of TDT, adjusted for influence of established prognostic variables on outcomes. Median TDT was 3 days (interquartile range, 2-7). Unadjusted 2-year OS rates, stratified by TDT of 0 to 5, 6 to 10, 11 to 15, and >15 days, were 51%, 48%, 44%, and 50% (P = .211). In multivariable Cox regression analysis accounting for established prognostic variables, the TDT hazard ratio as a continuous variable was 1.00 (P = .617). In OS analyses, separately stratified for age </=60 and >60 years and for high vs lower initial white blood cell count, no significant differences between TDT groups were observed. Our study suggests that TDT is not related to survival. As stratification in intensive first-line AML treatment evolves, TDT data suggest that it may be a feasible approach to wait for genetic and other laboratory test results so that clinically stable patients are assigned the best available treatment option.

The 2 major subtypes of CBF-AML include t(8;21) and inversion of chromosome 16, accounting for approximately 25% of patients. Because of expensive and toxic treatment, which may require hospitalization during the entire course of induction chemotherapy, most of the centers in Pakistan neither workup for this low-risk entity nor offer curative treatment. Therefore, we adopted an approach of screening AML cases for the presence of CBF with the rationale of offering curative treatment to this subgroup. Data of 244 cases were reviewed, and translocations were found in 72 (34%) patients among them, 59 (82%) had t(8;21) and 13 (18%) showed inversion of chromosome 16. The event-free survival with and without abandonment was 36% and 40%, respectively. Among 44 patients who completed treatment, 26 (59%) are leukemia-free, while 18 (41%) relapsed. None of the relapsed patients received salvage chemotherapy or hematopoietic stem cell transplant. Treatment-related mortality and abandonment was found in 24% and 10% of patients, respectively. The frequency of CBF-AML is higher in our study; however, poor outcome demands holistic measures in supportive care to improve the survival.","['Mansoor, Neelum', 'Jabbar, Naeem', 'Arshad, Uzma', 'Maqsood, Sidra', 'Habib, Muhammad A', 'Raza, Muhammad R']","['Mansoor N', 'Jabbar N', 'Arshad U', 'Maqsood S', 'Habib MA', 'Raza MR']","['The Indus Hospital.', 'The Indus Hospital.', 'Jinnah Medical College Hospital, Karachi, Pakistan.', 'The Indus Hospital.', 'The Indus Hospital.', 'The Indus Hospital.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",,United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Core Binding Factors)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Chromosome Inversion', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8/genetics', 'Core Binding Factors/*genetics', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/genetics/*pathology', 'Male', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', '*Translocation, Genetic']",,,,2020/06/05 06:00,2021/01/01 06:00,['2020/06/05 06:00'],"['2020/06/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/01 06:00 [medline]', '2020/06/05 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/MPH.0000000000001853 [doi]', '00043426-202008000-00015 [pii]']",ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2020 Aug;42(6):e423-e427. doi: 10.1097/MPH.0000000000001853.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we report the use of tisagenlecleucel in an infant with chemotherapy-refractory KMT2A-rearranged ALL. While CAR T-cell therapy was not curative for this patient, collection and expansion of T-cells proved feasible despite prior chemotherapy, he achieved minimal residual disease negative remission with excellent quality of life, and it facilitated a delay in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.","['Breese, Erin H', 'Krupski, Christa', 'Nelson, Adam S', 'Perentesis, John P', 'Phillips, Christine L']","['Breese EH', 'Krupski C', 'Nelson AS', 'Perentesis JP', 'Phillips CL']","['Division of Oncology.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH.', ""Division of Bone Marrow Transplantation & Immune Deficiency, Cancer and Blood Diseases Institute, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center."", 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH.', ""Division of Bone Marrow Transplantation & Immune Deficiency, Cancer and Blood Diseases Institute, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center."", 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH.', 'Division of Oncology.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH.', 'Division of Oncology.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,"['0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'Q6C9WHR03O (tisagenlecleucel)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD19/*immunology', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/*methods', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/immunology/*therapy', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*therapeutic use']",,,,2020/06/05 06:00,2021/05/15 06:00,['2020/06/05 06:00'],"['2020/01/21 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/15 06:00 [medline]', '2020/06/05 06:00 [entrez]']","['00043426-202105000-00005 [pii]', '10.1097/MPH.0000000000001857 [doi]']",ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2021 May 1;43(4):152-154. doi: 10.1097/MPH.0000000000001857.,,"['C.L.P. has served on an advisory board for Novartis.

Bioassay-guided fractionation of the cytotoxic extract from Dimerostemma aspilioides led to the isolation of the germacranolide tomenphantin A (1), along with three new analogues (2-4). These efficiently inhibited the proliferation of the leukemia cell lines K562 and CCRF-CEM and their resistant variants, Lucena 1 and CEM/ADR5000, respectively, with IC50 values ranging from 0.40 to 7.7 muM. The structures and relative configurations of compounds 1-4 were elucidated by analysis of the spectroscopic data, in particular NMR spectroscopy. The most active among these was compound 1 (IC50 = 0.40-5.1 muM), and, therefore, this was selected as a model for a mechanistic study, which revealed that its antiproliferative effect was mediated by cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase followed by apoptosis. The activity of compound 1 was selective, given the absence of cytotoxicity toward peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The results show the potential of these compounds, and in particular of compound 1, as leads for the development of drug candidates to fight sensitive and resistant leukemia cells.","['Garcia Manzano, Maria F', 'Joray, Mariana B', 'Laiolo, Jeronimo', 'Palacios, Sara M', 'Carpinella, Maria C']","['Garcia Manzano MF', 'Joray MB', 'Laiolo J', 'Palacios SM', 'Carpinella MC']","['Fine Chemical and Natural Products Laboratory, Research Institute of Natural Resources and Sustainability Jose Sanchez Labrador S.J.

We analyzed data from 536 AZA-treated patients with higher-risk MDS, Myelodysplastic/Myeloproliferative neoplasms and low blast count Acute Myeloid Leukemia enrolled to the Hellenic National Registry of Myelodysplastic and Hypoplastic Syndromes. Multivariate analysis adjusted also for the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS), its revised version (IPSS-R) and the French Prognostic Scoring System (FPSS), demonstrated independent associations of overall and leukemia-free survival with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <45 mL min(-1) /1.73 m(2) (P = .039, P = .023, respectively), ECOG performance status <2 (P = .015, P = .006), and presence of peripheral blood blasts (P = .008, P = .034), while secondary MDS also correlated with significantly shorter leukemia-free survival (P = .039). Addition of eGFR <45 mL min(-1) /1.73 m(2) , in IPSS-R and FPSS increased the predictive power of both models. Only FPSS </=2 and eGFR <45 mL min(-1) /1.73 m(2) predicted worse response to AZA in multivariate analysis, whereas eGFR <45 mL min(-1) /1.73 m(2) correlated significantly with death from hemorrhage (P = .003) and cardiovascular complications (P = .006). In conclusion, in the second largest real-world series of AZA-treated MDS patients, we show that an eGFR <45 mL min(-1) /1.73 m(2) is an independent predictor of worse response and survival. This higher cut-off, instead of the commonly used serum creatinine >2 mg/dL, can be utilized as a more precise indicator of renal comorbidity during AZA therapy. Incorporation of eGFR in the prognostic assessment of AZA-treated MDS patients may prove useful not only in routine practice, but also for the appropriate patient stratification in clinical trials with AZA combinations.","['Papadopoulos, Vasileios', 'Diamantopoulos, Panagiotis T', 'Papageorgiou, Sotirios G', 'Papoutselis, Menelaos', 'Vrachiolias, George', 'Pappa, Vassiliki', 'Galanopoulos, Athanasios G', 'Vassilakopoulos, Theodoros P', 'Hatzimichael, Eleftheria', 'Zikos, Panagiotis', 'Papadaki, Helen A', 'Bouchla, Anthi', 'Panayiotidis, Panayiotis', 'Megalakaki, Aekaterini', 'Papaioannou, Maria', 'Liapis, Konstantinos', 'Dryllis, George', 'Tsokanas, Dimitris', 'Kourakli, Alexandra', 'Symeonidis, Argiris', 'Viniou, Nora-Athina', 'Kotsianidis, Ioannis']","['Papadopoulos V', 'Diamantopoulos PT', 'Papageorgiou SG', 'Papoutselis M', 'Vrachiolias G', 'Pappa V', 'Galanopoulos AG', 'Vassilakopoulos TP', 'Hatzimichael E', 'Zikos P', 'Papadaki HA', 'Bouchla A', 'Panayiotidis P', 'Megalakaki A', 'Papaioannou M', 'Liapis K', 'Dryllis G', 'Tsokanas D', 'Kourakli A', 'Symeonidis A', 'Viniou NA', 'Kotsianidis I']","['Department of Hematology, Democritus University of Thrace Medical School, Alexandroupolis, Greece.', 'First Department of Internal Medicine, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Athens, Greece.', 'Second Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology Unit, Attikon University General Hospital, Athens, Greece.', 'Department of Hematology, Democritus University of Thrace Medical School, Alexandroupolis, Greece.', 'Department of Hematology, Democritus University of Thrace Medical School, Alexandroupolis, Greece.', 'Second Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology Unit, Attikon University General Hospital, Athens, Greece.', 'Department of Clinical Hematology, G.

The etiology and predisposing factors of ALL are unknown. The suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1) and SOCS2 are inhibitors of cytokine signal transduction. Gene polymorphisms of SOCS1 and SOCS2 and their expressions may be related to ALL. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 200 ALL patients in our hospital and 200 healthy people were enrolled in ALL group and control group, respectively. Genomic deoxyribonucleic acids (DNAs) and total RNAs were extracted from the peripheral blood of each subject. Gene polymorphisms of SOCS1 at rs33977706, rs243327, and rs33932899 and those of SOCS2 at rs3816997 were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequenced. Besides, the expression levels of SOCS1 and SOCS2 in ALL patients were detected by real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR. RESULTS: The frequency of the allele C of SOCS1 rs33977706 in ALL group was lower than that in the control group, displaying a significant difference between the two groups (p=0.015). The frequency of allele A of SOCS2 rs3816997 was notably higher in ALL group than that of the control group (p=0.000). In addition, the frequency of CA genotype of SOCS1 rs33977706 in ALL group was markedly lower than that in the control group, showing a significant difference (p=0.000). ALL group had remarkably higher frequencies of AA genotype of SOCS2 rs3816997 (p=0.000) and ACC haplotype of SOCS gene (p=0.000), and lower frequencies of ATG (p=0.026) and CCC (p=0.006) haplotypes. The two loci, SOCS1 rs33932899 and SOCS1 rs243327, were linked to each other (D'=0.781). Moreover, the expression level of SOCS1 in ALL group was lower than that in the control group, in which the expression of the CT genotype of SOCS1 rs243327 was relatively higher (p=0.021). SOCS2 level was lower in ALL group. Particularly, SOCS2 level in ALL patients carrying AC genotype was lower than those carrying AA and CC genotypes (p=0.000). ALL patients carrying CT genotype of SOCS1 rs243327 had shorter period of agranulocytosis (p=0.000), a lower ratio of bone marrow primitive/immature cells (p=0.001), and a higher hemoglobin (Hb) level in blood (p=0.000). The ratio of bone marrow primordial/immature cells was lower in ALL patients with AC genotype of SOCS2 rs3816997 (p=0.038). CONCLUSIONS: The expression levels of SOCS1 and SOCS2 are prominently related to ALL, and their polymorphisms are associated with the susceptibility to ALL.","['Chen, S-S', 'Wu, W-Z', 'Zhang, Y-P', 'Huang, W-J']","['Chen SS', 'Wu WZ', 'Zhang YP', 'Huang WJ']","[""Department of Hematology, Yixing People's Hospital, Yixing, China. staff151yxph.com.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Italy,Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,9717360,"['0 (SOCS1 protein, human)', '0 (SOCS2 protein, human)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 1 Protein)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Polymorphism, Genetic/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 1 Protein/blood/*genetics', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins/blood/*genetics']",,,,2020/06/05 06:00,2021/03/26 06:00,['2020/06/05 06:00'],"['2020/06/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/06/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.26355/eurrev_202005_21342 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci. 2020 May;24(10):5564-5572. doi: 10.26355/eurrev_202005_21342.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A novel cancer-related lncRNA, leukemia inhibitory factor receptor antisense RNA 1 (LIFR-AS1), has been reported to be under-expressed in breast cancer and associated with poor prognosis, but its significance in gastric cancer (GC) remains to be determined. Therefore, we assessed the prognostic and diagnostic value of LIFR-AS1 in GC. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Quantitative RT-PCR assay was used to detect the expression levels of LIFR-AS1 in GC tissues and adjacent normal tissues. The correlation between LIFR-AS1 expression and clinicopathological features was analyzed by Pearson's chi2-test. The disease-free survival and overall survival rates of GC patients were calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Cox regression analysis was used to assess factors related to survival. RESULTS: In this study, levels of LIFR-AS1 were significantly higher in GC tumor samples relative to adjacent normal tissue samples. A ROC analysis suggested LIFR-AS1 expression could be reliably used to differentiate between normal and GC tumor tissue. In addition, elevated LIFR-AS1 expression was positively correlated with more advanced and aggressive GC features, such as larger tumor size, lymphatic metastasis, and more advanced TNM stage. Survival analyses revealed that elevated LIFR-AS1 expression was correlated with worse overall survival and disease-free survival. Multivariate analysis further confirmed the relevance of LIFR-AS1 as an independent predictor of GC patient outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, these results indicate that the lncRNA LIFR-AS1 is a promising prognostic indicator in GC patients.","['Wang, H-F', 'Lv, J-Q', 'Li, H-H', 'Wang, W', 'Lin, F-Q']","['Wang HF', 'Lv JQ', 'Li HH', 'Wang W', 'Lin FQ']","[""Department of Gastrointestinal Surgery, Shaoxing People's Hospital, Shaoxing, Zhejiang Province, China. q904wa@163.com.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Italy,Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,9717360,"['0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Long Noncoding/*genetics/metabolism', 'Stomach Neoplasms/diagnosis/*genetics/metabolism', 'Survival Rate']",,,,2020/06/05 06:00,2021/03/31 06:00,['2020/06/05 06:00'],"['2020/06/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/06/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.26355/eurrev_202005_21321 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci. 2020 May;24(10):5378-5384. doi: 10.26355/eurrev_202005_21321.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients aged 16-65 years diagnosed with cytogenetically intermediate-risk AML, and who achieved CR1 were included. We retrospectively analyzed FLT3-ITD, NPM1 mutations and CEBPa using samples obtained at diagnosis, which therefore did not affect the therapeutic decisions. Among 235 patients who had achieved CR1, 152 relapsed, and 52% of them achieved second CR. The rate of achieving second CR was significantly higher (85%) in those with dmCEBPa. Patients with FLT3-ITD had significantly worse OS after relapse than those without (19% vs 41%, p = 0.002), while OS was comparable between patients with and without NPM1 mutations (37% vs 34%, p = 0.309).

This review summarizes features of mutant NPM1-related disease, with a particular emphasis on recent discoveries relevant to disease monitoring, prognostication, and therapeutic intervention. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent studies have shown that HOX/MEIS gene overexpression is central to the survival of NPM1-mutated cells. Two distinct classes of small molecule drugs, BH3 mimetics and menin-MLL interaction inhibitors, have demonstrated exquisite leukemic cell toxicity in preclinical AML models associated with HOX/MEIS overexpression, and the former of these has shown efficacy in older treatment-naive NPM1-mutated AML patients. The results of ongoing clinical trials further investigating these compounds will be of particular importance and may alter the clinical management of patients with NPM1-mutated myeloid neoplasms. Significant scientific advancements over the last decade, including improved sequencing and disease monitoring techniques, have fostered a much deeper understanding of mutant NPM1 disease biology, prognostication, and opportunities for therapeutic intervention. These discoveries have led to the development of clinical assays that permit the detection and monitoring of mutant NPM1 and have paved the way for future investigation of targeted therapeutics using emerging cutting-edge techniques.","['Patel, Sanjay S', 'Kluk, Michael J', 'Weinberg, Olga K']","['Patel SS', 'Kluk MJ', 'Weinberg OK']","['Division of Hematopathology, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, USA.', 'Division of Hematopathology, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, USA.', ""Department of Pathology, Boston Children's Hospital, 300 Longwood Avenue, Bader 126.2, Boston, MA, 02115, USA. olga.weinberg@childrens.harvard.edu.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Curr Hematol Malig Rep,Current hematologic malignancy reports,101262565,"['0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/pathology/therapy', '*Mutation', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics/pathology/therapy', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Phenotype', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Factors']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myeloid leukemia', '*Minimal residual disease', '*Myelodysplastic syndrome', '*NPM1', '*Nucleophosmin']",2020/06/05 06:00,2020/12/22 06:00,['2020/06/05 06:00'],"['2020/06/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/22 06:00 [medline]', '2020/06/05 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s11899-020-00592-3 [doi]', '10.1007/s11899-020-00592-3 [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Hematol Malig Rep. 2020 Aug;15(4):350-359. doi: 10.1007/s11899-020-00592-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The current study aims to investigate the effects of berberine on acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and the mechanism beyond apoptosis. Methods: Cell viability was determined in ALL cell lines EU-6 and SKW-3 using trypan blue staining. Cell autophagy was determined by immunofluorescence and Western blot. ALL xenograft mice were established to investigate the anti-tumor effects of BBR. The molecular mechanism was explored in ALL cell lines using siRNA and signaling inhibitors. Results: Herein, we show that berberine treatment significantly inhibits ALL cell viability and promotes cell death by inducing autophagy in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, berberine significantly alleviates the aggressive pathological condition in ALL xenograft mice. Mechanistic studies exhibit that berberine induces autophagic death in ALL cells by inactivating AKT/mTORC1 signaling. Chemically targeting AKT/mTORC1 signaling controls berberine-induced cell autophagy in vitro, and blockade of autophagic process blunts berberine-alleviated pathological condition in vivo. Discussion: In conclusion, our study reveals that berberine could induce ALL cell autophagic death by inactivating AKT/mTORC1 signaling that could be used to develop small molecule drug for ALL treatment.","['Liu, Jian', 'Liu, Peng', 'Xu, Tiantian', 'Chen, Zhiwei', 'Kong, Huimin', 'Chu, Weihong', 'Wang, Yingchao', 'Liu, Yufeng']","['Liu J', 'Liu P', 'Xu T', 'Chen Z', 'Kong H', 'Chu W', 'Wang Y', 'Liu Y']","[""Department of Pediatrics, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450052, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Pediatric Intensive Care Unit, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450052, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Pediatrics, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450052, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Pediatrics, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450052, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Pediatrics, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450052, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Pediatrics, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450052, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Pediatrics, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450052, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Pediatrics, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450052, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200512,New Zealand,Drug Des Devel Ther,"Drug design, development and therapy",101475745,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0I8Y3P32UF (Berberine)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Autophagic Cell Death/drug effects', 'Berberine/*pharmacology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Humans', 'Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Young Adult']",PMC7229801,['NOTNLM'],"['AKT/mTORC1', 'acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'autophagy', 'berberine']",2020/06/05 06:00,2021/03/30 06:00,['2020/06/05 06:00'],"['2019/11/19 00:00 [received]', '2020/04/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/06/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/30 06:00 [medline]']","['10.2147/DDDT.S239247 [doi]', '239247 [pii]']",epublish,Drug Des Devel Ther. 2020 May 12;14:1813-1823. doi: 10.2147/DDDT.S239247. eCollection 2020.,['ORCID: 0000-0002-8738-9105'],['The authors declare no conflicts of interest in this work.'],['(c) 2020 Liu et al.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to investigate the methylation degree of a distinct phospholipase A2 receptor 1 (PLA2R1) promoter region in paediatric ALL patients and to evaluate its relevance as new biomarker for monitoring treatment response and burden of residual disease. The impact of PLA2R1 re-expression on proliferative parameters was assessed in vitro in Jurkat cells with PLA2R1 naturally silenced by DNA methylation. Genomic DNA was isolated from bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood (PB) of 44 paediatric ALL patients. PLA2R1 methylation was analysed using digital PCR and compared to 20 healthy controls. Transfected Jurkat cells were investigated using cell growth curve analysis and flow cytometry. PLA2R1 was found hypermethylated in BM and PB from pre-B and common ALL patients, and in patients with the disease relapse. PLA2R1 methylation decreased along with leukaemic blast cell reduction during ALL induction treatment. In vitro analysis revealed an anti-proliferative phenotype associated with PLA2R1 re-expression, suggesting a tumour-suppressive function of PLA2R1. Collected data indicates that PLA2R1 promoter methylation quantitation can be used as biomarker for ALL induction treatment control, risk stratification, and early detection of ALL relapse.","['Friedemann, Markus', 'Gutewort, Katharina', 'Thiem, Dana', 'Nacke, Brit', 'Jandeck, Carsten', 'Lange, Bjorn Sonke', 'Sukocheva, Olga', 'Suttorp, Meinolf', 'Menschikowski, Mario']","['Friedemann M', 'Gutewort K', 'Thiem D', 'Nacke B', 'Jandeck C', 'Lange BS', 'Sukocheva O', 'Suttorp M', 'Menschikowski M']","['Institute of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine, University Hospital Carl Gustav Carus, Technical University of Dresden, 01307, Dresden, Germany.', 'Institute of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine, University Hospital Carl Gustav Carus, Technical University of Dresden, 01307, Dresden, Germany.', 'Institute of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine, University Hospital Carl Gustav Carus, Technical University of Dresden, 01307, Dresden, Germany.', 'Institute of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine, University Hospital Carl Gustav Carus, Technical University of Dresden, 01307, Dresden, Germany.', 'Institute of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine, University Hospital Carl Gustav Carus, Technical University of Dresden, 01307, Dresden, Germany.', 'Department of Paediatrics, University Hospital Carl Gustav Carus, Technical University of Dresden, 01307, Dresden, Germany.', 'School of Health Sciences, Flinders University of South Australia, Bedford Park, 5042, Australia.', 'Medical Faculty, Paediatric Haemato-Oncology, Technical University, 01307, Dresden, Germany.', 'Institute of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine, University Hospital Carl Gustav Carus, Technical University of Dresden, 01307, Dresden, Germany.

Here, we investigated the role of T cells overexpressing Pbx1d in low-density lipoprotein receptor-deficient (Ldlr-/-) mice fed with a high-fat diet, an experimental model for atherosclerosis. Pbx1d-transgenic T cells exacerbated some phenotypes of atherosclerosis, which were associated with higher autoantibody production, increased Tfh cell frequency, and impaired Treg cell regulation, in Ldlr-/- mice as compared with control T cells. In addition, we showed that dyslipidemia and Pbx1d-transgenic expression independently impaired the differentiation and function of Treg cells in vitro, suggesting a gene/environment additive effect. Thus, our results suggest that the combination of Pbx1d expression in T cells and dyslipidemia exacerbates both atherosclerosis and autoimmunity, at least in part through a dysregulation of Treg cell homeostasis.","['Li, Wei', 'Elshikha, Ahmed S', 'Cornaby, Caleb', 'Teng, Xiangyu', 'Abboud, Georges', 'Brown, Josephine', 'Zou, Xueyang', 'Zeumer-Spataro, Leilani', 'Robusto, Brian', 'Choi, Seung-Chul', 'Fredenburg, Kristianna', 'Major, Amy', 'Morel, Laurence']","['Li W', 'Elshikha AS', 'Cornaby C', 'Teng X', 'Abboud G', 'Brown J', 'Zou X', 'Zeumer-Spataro L', 'Robusto B', 'Choi SC', 'Fredenburg K', 'Major A', 'Morel L']","['Department of Pathology, Immunology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Immunology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, USA.', 'Department of Pharmaceutics, Zagazig University, Zagazig, Sharkia, Egypt.', 'Department of Pathology, Immunology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Immunology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Immunology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Immunology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Immunology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, USA.', 'Department of Immunology, College of Basic Medical Sciences, Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'Department of Pathology, Immunology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Immunology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Immunology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Immunology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Rheumatology and Immunology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.', 'U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, Tennessee Valley Healthcare System, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Immunology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, USA.']",['eng'],"['I01 BX002968/BX/BLRD VA/United States', 'R01 AI045050/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20200604,United States,JCI Insight,JCI insight,101676073,"['0 (Pbx1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1)']",IM,"['*Alleles', 'Animals', '*Atherosclerosis/genetics/immunology/pathology', '*Dyslipidemias/genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*immunology', 'Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic/genetics/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1/genetics/*immunology', '*T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/immunology/pathology']",PMC7308052,['NOTNLM'],"['*Autoimmunity', '*Cardiology', '*T cells']",2020/06/05 06:00,2021/05/19 06:00,['2020/06/05 06:00'],"['2020/03/18 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/06/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/19 06:00 [medline]']","['138274 [pii]', '10.1172/jci.insight.138274 [doi]']",epublish,JCI Insight. 2020 Jun 4;5(11). pii: 138274. doi: 10.1172/jci.insight.138274.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although immunotherapy may be an attractive modality to exploit in patients with AML, the ability to predict the groups of patients and the types of cancer that will respond to immune targeting remains limited. This study dissected the complexity of the immune architecture of AML at high resolution and assessed its influence on therapeutic response. Using 442 primary bone marrow samples from three independent cohorts of children and adults with AML, we defined immune-infiltrated and immune-depleted disease classes and revealed critical differences in immune gene expression across age groups and molecular disease subtypes. Interferon (IFN)-gamma-related mRNA profiles were predictive for both chemotherapy resistance and response of primary refractory/relapsed AML to flotetuzumab immunotherapy. Our compendium of microenvironmental gene and protein profiles provides insights into the immuno-biology of AML and could inform the delivery of personalized immunotherapies to IFN-gamma-dominant AML subtypes.","['Vadakekolathu, Jayakumar', 'Minden, Mark D', 'Hood, Tressa', 'Church, Sarah E', 'Reeder, Stephen', 'Altmann, Heidi', 'Sullivan, Amy H', 'Viboch, Elena J', 'Patel, Tasleema', 'Ibrahimova,

These MCSCs are CD90-CD13-CD44+ and differ from MSCs in isolation, expansion, differentiation, immunophenotype, and cytokine release profile. Furthermore, blocking CD44 inhibited the proliferation and cluster formation of early MCSCs with lower ICAM-1 protein levels. Similar CD90-CD44+ cancer stem cells have been reported in both gastric and breast cancers, which grew in floating spheres in vitro and exhibited mesenchymal features and high metastatic/tumorigenic capabilities in vivo. Our novel discovery provides the first evidence that certain AMLs may be comprised of both hematopoietic and stromal malignant cells. Targeting MCSCs and their cytokine release has potential as a novel therapeutic approach in AML.","['Cao, Huynh', 'Xiao, Jeffrey', 'Reeves, Mark E', 'Payne, Kimberly', 'Chen, Chien Shing', 'Baylink, David J', 'Marcucci, Guido', 'Xu, Yi']","['Cao H', 'Xiao J', 'Reeves ME', 'Payne K', 'Chen CS', 'Baylink DJ', 'Marcucci G', 'Xu Y']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, Loma Linda University Medical Center, Loma Linda, CA, USA.', 'Regenerative Medicine, Department of Medicine, Loma Linda University, Loma Linda, CA, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Loma Linda University Medical Center, Loma Linda, CA, USA.', 'Division of Anatomy, Department of Basic Sciences, Loma Linda University, Loma Linda, CA, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Loma Linda University Medical Center, Loma Linda, CA, USA.', 'Regenerative Medicine, Department of Medicine, Loma Linda University, Loma Linda, CA, USA.', 'Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, Hematology Malignancies and Stem Cell Transplantation Institute, City of Hope Medical Center, Duarte, CA, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Loma Linda University Medical Center, Loma Linda, CA, USA. dyxu@llu.edu.', 'Regenerative Medicine, Department of Medicine, Loma Linda University, Loma Linda, CA, USA. dyxu@llu.edu.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Comparative Study', 'Letter', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200603,England,J Hematol Oncol,Journal of hematology & oncology,101468937,"['0 (Angiogenic Proteins)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (CD44 protein, human)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Hyaluronan Receptors)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)']",IM,"['Angiogenic Proteins/metabolism', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Separation', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hyaluronan Receptors/*analysis', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/metabolism/*pathology', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/chemistry/metabolism/*pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/chemistry/classification/metabolism/*pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",PMC7268388,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myeloid leukemia', '*Angiogenesis', '*CD44', '*Mesenchymal cancer stem cells', '*Mesenchymal stem cells', '*Microenvironment']",2020/06/05 06:00,2021/05/18 06:00,['2020/06/05 06:00'],"['2020/03/16 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/06/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/18 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13045-020-00899-x [doi]', '10.1186/s13045-020-00899-x [pii]']",epublish,J Hematol Oncol. 2020 Jun 3;13(1):63. doi: 10.1186/s13045-020-00899-x.,['ORCID: 0000-0002-6917-184X'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, the clinical significance of other important prognostic factors was evaluated with multivariate analyses. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Newly diagnosed acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) patients were registered with the study. Induction was composed of ATRA and chemotherapy. Patients who achieved molecular remission after consolidation were randomly assigned to maintenance with tamibarotene or ATRA. RESULTS: Of the 344 eligible patients, 319 (93%) achieved complete remission (CR). After completing consolidation, 269 patients underwent maintenance random assignment-135 to ATRA, and 134 to tamibarotene. By multivariate analysis, overexpression of CD56 in blast was an independent unfavorable prognostic factor for relapse-free survival (RFS) (p = 0.006) together with more than 10.0 x 10(9)/L WBC counts (p = 0.001) and the ATRA arm in maintenance (p = 0.028). Of all phenotypes, CD56 was related most clearly to an unfavorable prognosis.

Further, there is evidence that uremic endothelial cells are both involved in and victims of the activation of the innate immunity. Uremic endothelial cells produce danger associated molecular patterns (DAMPS), which by binding to specific pattern recognition receptors expressed in multiple cells, including endothelial cells, induce the expression of adhesion molecules, the production of proinflammatory cytokines and an enhanced production of reactive oxygen species in endothelial cells, which constitute a link between immunity and inflammation.

To treat the disease successfully, new therapeutic strategies are urgently needed. One of these strategies can be the use of neurokinin-1 receptor (NK-1R) antagonists (e.g., aprepitant), because the substance P (SP)/NK-1R system is involved in cancer progression, including AML. AML patients show an up-regulation of the NK-1R mRNA expression; human AML cell lines show immunoreactivity for both SP and the NK-1R (it is overexpressed: the truncated isoform is more expressed than the full-length form) and, via this receptor, SP and NK-1R antagonists (aprepitant, in a concentration-dependent manner) respectively exert a proliferative action or an antileukemic effect (apoptotic mechanisms are triggered by promoting oxidative stress via mitochondrial Ca(++) overload). Aprepitant inhibits the formation of AML cell colonies and, in combination with chemotherapeutic drugs, is more effective in inducing cytotoxic effects and AML cell growth blockade. NK-1R antagonists also exert an antinociceptive effect in myeloid leukemia-induced bone pain. The antitumor effect of aprepitant is diminished when the NF-kappaB pathway is overactivated and the damage induced by aprepitant in cancer cells is higher than that exerted in non-cancer cells. Thus, the SP/NK-1R system is involved in AML, and aprepitant is a promising antitumor strategy against this hematological malignancy. In this review, the involvement of this system in solid and non-solid tumors (in particular in AML) is updated and the use of aprepitant as an anti-leukemic strategy for the treatment of AML is also mentioned (a dose of aprepitant (>20 mg/kg/day) for a period of time according to the response to treatment is suggested). Aprepitant is currently used in clinical practice as an anti-nausea medication.","['Munoz, Miguel', 'Covenas, Rafael']","['Munoz M', 'Covenas R']","['Research Laboratory on Neuropeptides (IBIS), Virgen del Rocio University Hospital, 41013 Sevilla, Spain.', 'Institute of Neurosciences of Castilla y Leon (INCYL), Laboratory of Neuroanatomy of the Peptidergic Systems, University of Salamanca, 37007 Salamanca, Spain.']",['eng'],['Programa XI/Universidad de Salamanca'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200601,Switzerland,J Clin Med,Journal of clinical medicine,101606588,,,,PMC7355887,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'NK-1R', 'anti-leukemic', 'apoptosis', 'aprepitant', 'non-solid tumor', 'substance P']",2020/06/05 06:00,2020/06/05 06:01,['2020/06/05 06:00'],"['2020/04/13 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/09 00:00 [revised]', '2020/05/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/06/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/05 06:01 [medline]']","['jcm9061659 [pii]', '10.3390/jcm9061659 [doi]']",epublish,J Clin Med. 2020 Jun 1;9(6). pii: jcm9061659. doi: 10.3390/jcm9061659.,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-2853-8481', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5677-8266']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Necroptosis is a proinflammatory form of cell death instigated by pore-forming toxins such as S. pneumoniae pneumolysin. Necroptosis-inhibiting drugs may lessen organ damage during invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD). METHODS: In vitro experiments were carried out with human and mouse cardiomyocytes. Long-term cardiac damage was assessed using high-resolution echocardiography in ampicillin-rescued mice 3 months after challenge with S. pneumoniae. Ponatinib, a necroptosis-inhibiting and Food and Drug Administration-approved drug for lymphocytic leukemia treatment, was administered intraperitoneally alongside ampicillin to test its therapeutic efficacy. Histology of heart sections included hematoxylin-eosin staining for overt damage, immunofluorescence for necroptosis, and Sirius red/fast green staining for collagen deposition. RESULTS: Cardiomyocyte death and heart damage was due to pneumolysin-mediated necroptosis. IPD leads to long-term cardiac damage, as evidenced by de novo collagen deposition in mouse hearts and a decrease in fractional shortening. Adjunct necroptosis inhibition reduced the number of S. pneumoniae foci observed in hearts of acutely infected mice and serum levels of troponin I. Ponatinib reduced collagen deposition and protected heart function in convalescence. CONCLUSIONS: Acute and long-term cardiac damage incurred during IPD is due in part to cardiomyocyte necroptosis. Necroptosis inhibitors may be a viable adjunct therapy.","['Beno, Sarah M', 'Riegler, Ashleigh N', 'Gilley, Ryan P', 'Brissac, Terry', 'Wang, Yong', 'Kruckow, Katherine L', 'Jadapalli, Jeevan K', 'Wright, Griffin M', 'Shenoy, Anukul T', 'Stoner, Sara N', 'Restrepo, Marcos I', 'Deshane, Jessy S', 'Halade, Ganesh V', 'Gonzalez-Juarbe, Norberto', 'Orihuela, Carlos J']","['Beno SM', 'Riegler AN', 'Gilley RP', 'Brissac T', 'Wang Y', 'Kruckow KL', 'Jadapalli JK', 'Wright GM', 'Shenoy AT', 'Stoner SN', 'Restrepo MI', 'Deshane JS', 'Halade GV', 'Gonzalez-Juarbe N', 'Orihuela CJ']","['Department of Microbiology, The University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology, The University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Molecular Genetics, University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, San Antonio, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology, The University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Pulmonary, Allergy, and Critical Care Medicine, The University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology, The University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Cardiovascular Disease, The University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Cardiovascular Disease, The University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology, The University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology, The University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama, USA.', 'South Texas Veterans Health Care System, San Antonio, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Pulmonary, Allergy, and Critical Care Medicine, The University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Cardiovascular Disease, The University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology, The University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology, The University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 AI114800/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 AI007051/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Infect Dis,The Journal of infectious diseases,0413675,"['0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Pyridazines)', '4340891KFS (ponatinib)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Receptor-Interacting Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ripk3 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bacteremia', 'Cell Death', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', '*Heart', 'Imidazoles', 'Leukemia/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', '*Necroptosis', 'Pneumococcal Infections', 'Pneumonia, Pneumococcal/*complications', 'Protein Kinases', 'Pyridazines', 'Receptor-Interacting Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/genetics', 'Streptococcus pneumoniae']",PMC7896277,['NOTNLM'],"['* Streptococcus pneumoniae', '*Ponatinib', '*cell death', '*echocardiograph', '*heart']",2020/06/04 06:00,2021/03/26 06:00,['2020/06/04 06:00'],"['2020/01/10 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/26 06:00 [medline]', '2020/06/04 06:00 [entrez]']","['5850973 [pii]', '10.1093/infdis/jiaa295 [doi]']",ppublish,J Infect Dis. 2020 Nov 9;222(11):1882-1893. doi: 10.1093/infdis/jiaa295.,,,"['(c) The Author(s) 2020.

Recent analyses of mutant ASXL1 conditional knockin (ASXL1-MT-KI) mice suggested that ASXL1-MT alone is insufficient for myeloid transformation. In our previous study, we used retrovirus-mediated insertional mutagenesis, which exhibited the susceptibility of ASXL1-MT-KI hematopoietic cells to transform into myeloid leukemia cells. In this screening, we identified the hematopoietically expressed homeobox (HHEX) gene as one of the common retrovirus integration sites. In this study, we investigated the potential cooperation between ASXL1-MT and HHEX in myeloid leukemogenesis. Expression of HHEX enhanced proliferation of ASXL1-MT-expressing HSPCs by inhibiting apoptosis and blocking differentiation, whereas it showed only modest effect in normal HSPCs. Moreover, ASXL1-MT and HHEX accelerated the development of RUNX1-ETO9a and FLT3-ITD leukemia. Conversely, HHEX depletion profoundly attenuated the colony-forming activity and leukemogenicity of ASXL1-MT-expressing leukemia cells. Mechanistically, we identified MYB and ETV5 as downstream targets for ASXL1-MT and HHEX by using transcriptome and chromatin immunoprecipitation-next-generation sequencing analyses. Moreover, we found that expression of ASXL1-MT enhanced the binding of HHEX to the promoter loci of MYB or ETV5 via reducing H2AK119ub. Depletion of MYB or ETV5 induced apoptosis or differentiation in ASXL1-MT-expressing leukemia cells, respectively. In addition, ectopic expression of MYB or ETV5 reversed the reduced colony-forming activity of HHEX-depleted ASXL1-MT-expressing leukemia cells. These findings indicate that the HHEX-MYB/ETV5 axis promotes myeloid transformation in ASXL1-mutated preleukemia cells.","['Takeda, Reina', 'Asada, Shuhei', 'Park, Sung-Joon', 'Yokoyama, Akihiko', 'Becker, Hans Jiro', 'Kanai, Akinori', 'Visconte, Valeria', 'Hershberger, Courtney', 'Hayashi, Yasutaka', 'Yonezawa, Taishi', 'Tamura, Moe', 'Fukushima, Tsuyoshi', 'Tanaka, Yosuke', 'Fukuyama, Tomofusa', 'Matsumoto, Akiko', 'Yamasaki, Satoshi', 'Nakai, Kenta', 'Yamazaki, Satoshi', 'Inaba, Toshiya', 'Shibata, Tatsuhiro', 'Inoue, Daichi', 'Honda, Hiroaki', 'Goyama, Susumu', 'Maciejewski, Jaroslaw P', 'Kitamura, Toshio']","['Takeda R', 'Asada S', 'Park SJ', 'Yokoyama A', 'Becker HJ', 'Kanai A', 'Visconte V', 'Hershberger C', 'Hayashi Y', 'Yonezawa T', 'Tamura M', 'Fukushima T', 'Tanaka Y', 'Fukuyama T', 'Matsumoto A', 'Yamasaki S', 'Nakai K', 'Yamazaki S', 'Inaba T', 'Shibata T', 'Inoue D', 'Honda H', 'Goyama S', 'Maciejewski JP', 'Kitamura T']","['Division of Cellular Therapy, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Cellular Therapy, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', ""The Institute of Laboratory Animals, Tokyo Women's Medical University, Tokyo, Japan."", 'Human Genome Center, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'National Cancer Center Tsuruoka Metabolomics Laboratory, Yamagata, Japan.', 'Division of Stem Cell Biology, Center for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular Oncology and Leukemia Program Project, Research Institute for Radiation Biology and Medicine, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima, Japan.', 'Department of Translational Hematology and Oncology Research, Taussig Cancer Institute, and.', 'Department of Cardiovascular and Metabolic Sciences, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH.', 'Division of Cellular Therapy, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology-Oncology, Institute of Biomedical Research and Innovation, Foundation for Biomedical Research and Innovation at Kobe, Kobe, Japan.', 'Division of Cellular Therapy, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Cellular Therapy, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Cellular Therapy, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Cellular Therapy, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Cellular Therapy, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Medicine, Human Genome Center, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan;

This incidence is due to the complexity in which the AML cells interact with other healthy human cells. These phenomena create an environment that favors the expansion of leukemic cells, which will affect the patient's prognosis. An important aspect is the ability of AML cells to evade immune responses via targeting and signaling immune cells to suppress anti-tumor responses. Many studies have reported that associations among components in the peripheral bloodstream might modulate leukemic progression because AML survival is a fundamental step for recolonizing bone marrow after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation or chemotherapy. Therefore, we collected the most important data about components that circulate with leukemic blasts and contribute to their survival and proliferation. We also discuss clinical approaches that could be conducted to more effectively treat the disease.","['Miyamoto, Kendi Nishino', 'Bonatto, Diego']","['Miyamoto KN', 'Bonatto D']","['Centro de Biotecnologia, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, Brazil..

We report that genetically clonal induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from an AML patient and characterized by exceptionally high engraftment potential give rise, upon hematopoietic differentiation, to a phenotypic hierarchy. Through fate-tracking experiments, xenotransplantation, and single-cell transcriptomics, we identify a cell fraction (iLSC) that can be isolated prospectively by means of adherent in vitro growth that resides on the apex of this hierarchy and fulfills the hallmark features of LSCs. Through integrative genomic studies of the iLSC transcriptome and chromatin landscape, we derive an LSC gene signature that predicts patient survival and uncovers a dependency of LSCs, across AML genotypes, on the RUNX1 transcription factor. These findings can empower efforts to therapeutically target AML LSCs.","['Wesely, Josephine', 'Kotini, Andriana G', 'Izzo, Franco', 'Luo, Hanzhi', 'Yuan, Han', 'Sun, Jun', 'Georgomanoli, Maria', 'Zviran, Asaf', 'Deslauriers, Andre G', 'Dusaj, Neville', 'Nimer, Stephen D', 'Leslie, Christina', 'Landau, Dan A', 'Kharas, Michael G', 'Papapetrou, Eirini P']","['Wesely J', 'Kotini AG', 'Izzo F', 'Luo H', 'Yuan H', 'Sun J', 'Georgomanoli M', 'Zviran A', 'Deslauriers AG', 'Dusaj N', 'Nimer SD', 'Leslie C', 'Landau DA', 'Kharas MG', 'Papapetrou EP']","['Department of Oncological Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA; Tisch Cancer Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA; Black Family Stem Cell Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA; Department of Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Oncological Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA; Tisch Cancer Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA; Black Family Stem Cell Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA; Department of Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.', 'Meyer Cancer Center, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA; New York Genome Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Molecular Pharmacology Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA; Center for Cell Engineering, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA; Center for Stem Cell Biology, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA; Center for Experimental Therapeutics, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Computational Biology Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL, USA.', 'Department of Oncological Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA; Tisch Cancer Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA; Black Family Stem Cell Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA; Department of Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.', 'Meyer Cancer Center, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA; New York Genome Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Oncological Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA; Tisch Cancer Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA; Black Family Stem Cell Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA; Department of Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA; Biotech Research and Innovation Center, University of Copenhagen, Denmark; Center for Hematologic Malignancies, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Meyer Cancer Center, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA; New York Genome Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL, USA.', 'Computational Biology Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Meyer Cancer Center, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA; New York Genome Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Molecular Pharmacology Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA; Center for Cell Engineering, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA; Center for Stem Cell Biology, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA; Center for Experimental Therapeutics, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.

Data on its efficacy and safety in children with high-grade, mature B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma are limited. METHODS: We conducted an open-label, international, randomized, phase 3 trial involving patients younger than 18 years of age with high-risk, mature B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (stage III with an elevated lactate dehydrogenase level or stage IV) or acute leukemia to compare the addition of six doses of rituximab to standard lymphomes malins B (LMB) chemotherapy with standard LMB chemotherapy alone. The primary end point was event-free survival. Overall survival and toxic effects were also assessed. RESULTS: Analyses were based on 328 patients who underwent randomization (164 patients per group); 85.7% of the patients had Burkitt's lymphoma. The median follow-up was 39.9 months. Events were observed in 10 patients in the rituximab-chemotherapy group and in 28 in the chemotherapy group. Event-free survival at 3 years was 93.9% (95% confidence interval [CI], 89.1 to 96.7) in the rituximab-chemotherapy group and 82.3% (95% CI, 75.7 to 87.5) in the chemotherapy group (hazard ratio for primary refractory disease or first occurrence of progression, relapse after response, death from any cause, or second cancer, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.15 to 0.66; one-sided P = 0.00096, which reached the significance level required for this analysis). Eight patients in the rituximab-chemotherapy group died (4 deaths were disease-related, 3 were treatment-related, and 1 was from a second cancer), as did 20 in the chemotherapy group (17 deaths were disease-related, and 3 were treatment-related) (hazard ratio, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.16 to 0.82). The incidence of acute adverse events of grade 4 or higher after prephase treatment was 33.3% in the rituximab-chemotherapy group and 24.2% in the chemotherapy group (P = 0.07); events were related mainly to febrile neutropenia and infection. Approximately twice as many patients in the rituximab-chemotherapy group as in the chemotherapy group had a low IgG level 1 year after trial inclusion. CONCLUSIONS: Rituximab added to standard LMB chemotherapy markedly prolonged event-free survival and overall survival among children and adolescents with high-grade, high-risk, mature B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and was associated with a higher incidence of hypogammaglobulinemia and, potentially, more episodes of infection.

Finding an optimal salvage regimen to bridge transplantation is a priority. The CAG (cytarabine, aclarubicin, and G-CSF) regimen was initially used by one group in China, showing unexpectedly promising results in 11 R/R-T-ALL patients. Here, we report the multicenter results of 41 patients who received the CAG regimen as salvage therapy. After one cycle of the CAG regimen, complete remission and partial remission were achieved in 33 (80.5%) and two (4.9%) patients, respectively. Failure to respond was observed in six patients (14.6%). Early T-cell precursor (ETP) (n = 26) and non-ETP (n = 15) patients had a similar CR rate (80.8% vs 80.0%, P = .95). Among 41 patients, allo-HSCT was successfully performed in 27 (66%) patients (22 in CR and 5 in non-CR). With a median follow-up time of 12 months, the estimated 2-year overall survival and event-free survival were 68.8% (95% CI, 47.3%-83.0%) and 56.5% (95% CI, 37.1%-71.9%), respectively. The CAG regimen was well-tolerated, and no early death occurred. Our multicenter results show that the CAG regimen is highly effective and safe, representing a novel choice for adult patients with R/R-T-ALL and providing a better bridge to transplantation.","['Qian, Jie-Jing', 'Hu, Xiaoxia', 'Wang, Ying', 'Zhang, Yi', 'Du, Juan', 'Yang, Min', 'Tong, Hongyan', 'Qian, Wen-Bin', 'Wei, Juying', 'Yu, Wenjun', 'Lou, Yin-Jun', 'Mao, Liping',

The development of new targeted drugs (Hylteritinib, Venetoclax) significantly improved the survival of patients, but resistance, as well as cytotoxic anti-leukemia drugs, often occurs. The search for new molecular targets for the development of effective approaches for the treatment of AML is very urgent. In blast cells of patients with AML, mutations, chromosomal rearrangements, and increased expression of a number of non-mutant genes, including transcription factor genes, are detected. The transcription factor Sp 1 binds to GC-rich regions of regulatory regions of various genes and thus controls their expression. Sp1 targets include genes responsible for proliferation, cell cycle regulation, and differentiation. In many malignant diseases, a high level of Sp1 gene expression is associated with an unfavorable prognosis, therefore, Sp1 is considered as a promising therapeutic target for cancer. In this paper, we estimated the expression levels of Sp1 in various malignant tissues. Increased Sp1 expression was detected in samples obtained from patients with AML, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, Ewing sarcoma, ovarian and kidney cancer. It is also shown that Sp1 expression correlates with the expression of genes encoding cytokine receptors and growth factors (CSF1R and IL6R), intracellular kinases (CSK, SYK, PAK1, ILK, JAK2), and transcription factor LMO2. The correlation between expression levels of Sp1 and CSF1R, SYK, Jak2 and LMO2 is also characteristic of transplanted human leukemia cells. We measured expression levels of Sp1, CSF1R, ILK, PAK1 in the cells of three transplantable lines of human leukemia and found increased levels of expression of these genes in Kasumi-1 cells. In addition, we showed that Kasumi-1 cells are most sensitive to Mitramycin, a drug that displaces Sp1 from its targets with DNA. Our data indicate the need to identify AML cells that are most sensitive to inhibition of Sp1 activity in order to assess the possibility of suppressing its activity in vivo.","['Vagapova, E R', 'Lebedev, T D', 'Tikhonova, A D', 'Goikhman, B V', 'Ivanenko, K A', 'Spirin, P V', 'Prassolov, V S']","['Vagapova ER', 'Lebedev TD', 'Tikhonova AD', 'Goikhman BV', 'Ivanenko KA', 'Spirin PV', 'Prassolov VS']","['Engelhardt Institute of Molecular Biology Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow, 119991 Russia.', 'Engelhardt Institute of Molecular Biology Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow, 119991 Russia.', 'Engelhardt Institute of Molecular Biology Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow, 119991 Russia.', 'Engelhardt Institute of Molecular Biology Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow, 119991 Russia.', 'Engelhardt Institute of Molecular Biology Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow, 119991 Russia.', 'Engelhardt Institute of Molecular Biology Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow, 119991 Russia.', 'Engelhardt Institute of Molecular Biology Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow, 119991 Russia.', 'prassolov45@mail.ru.']",['rus'],,['Journal Article'],,Russia (Federation),Mol Biol (Mosk),Molekuliarnaia biologiia,0105454,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (CSF1R protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '0 (Sp1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Sp1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (PAK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (p21-Activated Kinases)', 'NIJ123W41V (Plicamycin)']",IM,"['Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Plicamycin/*pharmacology', 'Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*metabolism', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sp1 Transcription Factor/*metabolism', 'p21-Activated Kinases/*metabolism']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Mitramycin', 'Sp1', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'malignant diseases', 'transcription factors']",2020/06/04 06:00,2020/12/15 06:00,['2020/06/04 06:00'],"['2020/01/17 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/06/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.31857/S0026898420030192 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Biol (Mosk). 2020 May-Jun;54(3):522-528. doi: 10.31857/S0026898420030192.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the role of mutation events in malignant cell transformation processes remains obscure. We searched for driver mutation events in leukemic cells containing the chimeric CBFB-MYH11 gene, which results from inversion of chromosome 16. Using target enrichment, the coding regions of 84 genes in genomes of 12 children with acute myeloid leukemia with inv(16) were investigated.

They can be a mixture of immunoglobulin (Ig) and complement components or immunoglobulins alone.[1] These cryoglobulins deposit in medium and large-sized blood vessels throughout the body, causing endothelial injury and end-organ damage known as cryoglobulinemia. Diagnosis of this entity should be suspected in patients presenting with skin ulcers, arthralgia, glomerulonephritis, neuropathy, and purpura. Brouet criteria classify cryoglobulinemia into three subgroups based on their immunoglobulin (Ig) composition.[2] Type I Cryoglobulinemia It has monoclonal Igs, typically IgG or IgM, and develops in the setting of lymphoproliferative or hematologic disorders of B cell lineage (e.g., multiple myeloma, Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, or protein-secreting monoclonal gammopathies like monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). Type II Cryoglobulinemia Type I and II are mixed cryoglobulinemia and have polyclonal Igs associated with autoimmune diseases, malignancy, or infections, particularly hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection.[3] Their constituent Ig is not a single monoclonal Ig. Cryoglobulins are composed of a mixture of a monoclonal IgM (or IgG or IgA) with rheumatoid factor (RF) activity and polyclonal Ig in type II cryoglobulinemia. These are often associated with: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Mixed cryoglobulinemia syndrome. Hepatitis B virus (HBV). HIV. Autoimmune diseases (mainly systemic lupus erythematosus [SLE], and Sjogren's syndrome). Lymphoproliferative disorders. About 10 percent of cases have no identifiable disease association, and hence the cryoglobulinemia is called ""essential."" Type III Cryoglobulinemia Cryoglobulins are composed of a mixture of polyclonal IgG (all isotypes) and polyclonal IgM in type III cryoglobulinemia. These cases are often secondary to autoimmune disorders. Sometimes, they can also be associated with infections (HCV most of the time).","['Bhandari, Jenish', 'Awais, Mashal', 'Aeddula, Narothama R.']","['Bhandari J', 'Awais M', 'Aeddula NR']",,['eng'],,"['Review', 'Book Chapter']",,Treasure Island (FL),,,,,,,,,,2020/06/04 06:01,2020/06/04 06:01,,,['NBK557606 [bookaccession]'],,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2022, StatPearls Publishing LLC.']",,,,,,,,,,,20200604,['20210607'],['StatPearls Publishing'],['StatPearls'],['2020/06/04 06:01'],

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate changes in nutritional status, food intake and appetite-regulating hormones among children and adolescents with acute lymphoblastic leukemia in the first phase of chemotherapy. DESIGN AND SETTING: Cohort study developed in the pediatric oncology departments of two hospitals in the city of Natal, Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil. METHODS: Fourteen children/adolescents (mean age of 7 years; 50% female) with acute lymphoblastic leukemia were monitored over the 28 days of an induction chemotherapy cycle. Anthropometric measurements, 24-hours food weight records and appetite-regulating hormone levels (ghrelin, leptin, insulin and cortisol) were obtained at three different times (before, in the middle and at the end of the induction phase). RESULTS: Most of the patients (85.7%) had normal weight at the beginning of the treatment, and this did not change significantly during the 28 days.

This makes the application of nanomedicines in neuro-oncology often considered unfeasible, with efficacy limited to regions of significant disease progression and compromised BBB. However, little is understood about how the evolving tumor-brain physiology during disease progression affects the permeability and retention of designer nanomedicines. We report here the development of a modular nanomedicine platform that, when used in conjunction with a unique model of how tumorigenesis affects BBB integrity, allows investigation of how nanomaterial properties affect uptake and retention in brain tissue. By combining different in vivo longitudinal imaging techniques (including positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance imaging), we have evaluated the retention of nanomedicines with predefined physicochemical properties (size and surface functionality) and established a relationship between structure and tissue accumulation as a function of a new parameter that measures BBB leakiness; this offers significant advancements in our ability to relate tumor accumulation of nanomedicines to more physiologically relevant parameters. Our data show that accumulation of nanomedicines in brain tumor tissue is better correlated with the leakiness of the BBB than actual tumor volume. This was evaluated by establishing brain tumors using a spontaneous and endogenously derived glioblastoma model providing a unique opportunity to assess these parameters individually and compare the results across multiple mice. We also quantitatively demonstrate that smaller nanomedicines (20 nm) can indeed cross the BBB and accumulate in tumors at earlier stages of the disease than larger analogues, therefore opening the possibility of developing patient-specific nanoparticle treatment interventions in earlier stages of the disease. Importantly, these results provide a more predictive approach for designing efficacious personalized nanomedicines based on a particular patient's condition.","['Houston, Zachary H', 'Bunt, Jens',

Newcastle disease virus (NDV) is a member of Paramyxoviridae that elicits considerable interest as an anticancer agent because it can replicate up to 10 000 times faster in human cancer cells than in most normal cancer cells. Several NDV strains reportedly induce the cytolysis of cancerous cell lines. The attenuated Iraqi strain (AMHA1) of NDV is a novel oncolytic agent with promising antitumor characteristics, including apoptosis induction. This study aimed to evaluate the ability of the AMHA1 NDV strain to induce apoptotic cell death in hematological tumors through caspase-dependent or independent apoptotic pathways. The cytolytic effects of AMHA1 NDV strains of different multiplicity of infection (MOIs) (20, 15,10, 5, 3, 1, 0.5, and 0.1 )and exposure for all hematological malignancy cell lines (human non-Hodgkin lymphoma SR and human multiple myeloma (COLO 677) and human monocytic leukemia THP1) have been determined through a microtetrazolium (MTT) assay. Propidium iodide and acridine orange (AO/PI) double staining were used to examine the ability of attenuated NDV strain to induce apoptosis in infected cells under a fluorescence microscope and to quantify the percentage of apoptosis induction. Quantitative immunocytochemistry assay was further used to study the caspase-dependent and independent protein expression levels in infected and control cells. Cells treated with NDV strains showed a higher cell-death percentage than untreated cells as quantified by the MTT assay. AO/PI results revealed that NDV exerted a powerful and significant effect on apoptosis induction (P<0.0001) in the human cancer cell lines tested in comparison with control cells. Immunocytochemistry in AMHA1 NDV- infected human hematological cell lines revealed a remarkable increase in the expression of caspase 8, 9 (dependent pathway), apoptosis-inducing factor, and endonuclease G (independent pathway) in comparison with untreated cells. This study demonstrated the role of the Iraqi NDV strain in inducing apoptosis through dependent and independent pathways in cancer cells and thus its high potential as an antitumor agent.","['Mohammed, Mohammed S', 'Al-Taee, Maha F', 'Al-Shammari, Ahmed Majeed']","['Mohammed MS', 'Al-Taee MF', 'Al-Shammari AM']","['Kufa Institute, Al-Furat Al-Awsat University, Iraq.', 'Biotechnology Department, college of Science, University of Baghdad, Baghdad, Iraq.', 'Biotechnology Department, college of Science, University of Baghdad, Baghdad, Iraq.', 'Experimental Therapy Department, Iraqi Center for cancer and medical genetics research, Mustansiriyah University, Baghdad, Iraq.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Iran,Int J Mol Cell Med,International journal of molecular and cellular medicine,101598104,,,,PMC7241843,['NOTNLM'],"['Hematologic neoplasms', 'attenuated NDV', 'oncolytic virotherapy']",2020/06/04 06:00,2020/06/04 06:01,['2020/06/04 06:00'],"['2020/06/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/06/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/04 06:01 [medline]']",['10.22088/IJMCM.BUMS.8.3.211 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Mol Cell Med. 2019 Summer;8(3):211-223. doi: 10.22088/IJMCM.BUMS.8.3.211.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Spinster homolog (SPNS) is a widely distributed transmembrane transporter, which assists sphingolipids in playing their roles through the cell membrane. However, the expression and clinical implication of the SPNS family has not been investigated in AML. From the Cancer Genome Atlas database, a total of 155 AML patients with complete clinical characteristics and SPNS1-3 expression data were contained in our study. In patients who received chemotherapy only, high expressions of SPNS2 and SPNS3 had adverse effects on event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) (all P<0.05). However, in the allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) group, we only found a significant difference in OS between the high and low SPNS3 expression groups (P=0.001), while other SPNS members showed no effect on survival. Multivariate analysis indicated that high SPNS2 expression was an independent risk factor for both EFS and OS in chemotherapy patients. The results confirmed that high expression of SPNS2 and SPNS3 were poor prognostic factors, and the effect of SPNS2 can be neutralized by allo-HSCT.","['Huang, Wenhui', 'Qian, Tingting', 'Cheng, Zhiheng', 'Zeng, Tiansheng', 'Si, Chaozeng', 'Liu, Chaojun', 'Deng, Cong', 'Ye, Xu', 'Liu, Yan', 'Cui, Longzhen', 'Fu, Lin']","['Huang W', 'Qian T', 'Cheng Z', 'Zeng T', 'Si C', 'Liu C', 'Deng C', 'Ye X', 'Liu Y', 'Cui L', 'Fu L']","['Department of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, 510260, China.', 'Translational Medicine Center, State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease, The Second Affiliated Hospital, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou 510260, China.', 'Guangdong Provincial Education Department Key Laboratory of Nano-Immunoregulation Tumor Microenvironment, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, 510260, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, 510260, China.', 'Translational Medicine Center, State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease, The Second Affiliated Hospital, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou 510260, China.', 'Guangdong Provincial Education Department Key Laboratory of Nano-Immunoregulation Tumor Microenvironment, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, 510260, China.', 'Department of Pathology and Medical Biology, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, 510260, China.', 'Translational Medicine Center, State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease, The Second Affiliated Hospital, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou 510260, China.', 'Guangdong Provincial Education Department Key Laboratory of Nano-Immunoregulation Tumor Microenvironment, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, 510260, China.', 'Information Center, China-Japan Friendship Hospital, Beijing, 100029, China.', 'Yinfeng Gene Technology Co., Ltd.; No.1109, Gangxing 3 Rd,New and High-tech Zone, Jinan City, Shandong Province, 250102, China.', 'Department of Clinical laboratory, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, 510260, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, 510260, China.', 'Translational Medicine Center, Huaihe Hospital of Henan University, Kaifeng, 475000, China.', 'Translational Medicine Center, Huaihe Hospital of Henan University, Kaifeng, 475000, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Huaihe Hospital of Henan University, Kaifeng, 475000, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, 510260, China.', 'Translational Medicine Center, State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease, The Second Affiliated Hospital, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou 510260, China.', 'Guangdong Provincial Education Department Key Laboratory of Nano-Immunoregulation Tumor Microenvironment, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, 510260, China.', 'Translational Medicine Center, Huaihe Hospital of Henan University, Kaifeng, 475000, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Huaihe Hospital of Henan University, Kaifeng, 475000, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200518,Australia,J Cancer,Journal of Cancer,101535920,,,,PMC7255376,['NOTNLM'],"['SPNS2', 'Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Prognosis', 'SPNS1', 'SPNS3']",2020/06/04 06:00,2020/06/04 06:01,['2020/06/04 06:00'],"['2020/02/10 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/06/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/04 06:01 [medline]']","['10.7150/jca.44766 [doi]', 'jcav11p4581 [pii]']",epublish,J Cancer. 2020 May 18;11(15):4581-4588. doi: 10.7150/jca.44766. eCollection 2020.,,['Competing Interests: The authors have declared that no competing interest exists.'],['(c) The author(s).'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although TX toxicity to APL cells is mediated by oxidative stress, DNA damage, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis, its mode of action in the transgenic mice model of APL is poorly understood. We hypothesized that TX regulates cell cycle and apoptosis in APL mice by p53 activation, DNA damage, and reduced expression of MDM2-DAXX-HAUSP complex. To test hypothesis, we treated APL mice with different doses (0, 1.25.2.5.5.0 & 7.5 mg/kg body wt) of TX and collected the liver and bone marrow cells. We applied several techniques to check the expression of PML-RARalpha, complex molecules, and DNA damage in APL mice bone marrow cells and liver. Our findings indicate that TX reduced the expression of PML-RARalpha and complex molecules, induced DNA damage and activated p53 leading to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in APL mice liver. We found that TX promoted more promyelocytes formation with dense granules in bone marrow cells. It also transmitted the DNA damage signal through protein kinase (ATM & ATR) leading to disruption of complex and activation of p53 in APL mice liver. TX induced cell cycle arrest through activation of p53, p21, and reduced expression of cyclin D1 and cyclin dependent kinases (CDK 2, 4 & 6) in mice liver. It also caused apoptosis through upregulation of caspase 3 and Bax expression, and down-regulation of Bcl2 expression. Taken together, these molecular targets provide new insights into TX mode of action in APL mice.","['Kumar, Sanjay', 'Tchounwou, Paul B']","['Kumar S', 'Tchounwou PB']","['Cellomics and Toxicogenomics Research Laboratory, NIH/NIMHD-RCMI Center for Environmental Health, College of Science, Engineering and Technology, Jackson State University, 1400 Lynch Street, Box18750, Jackson, Mississippi, MS 39217, USA.', 'Cellomics and Toxicogenomics Research Laboratory, NIH/NIMHD-RCMI Center for Environmental Health, College of Science, Engineering and Technology, Jackson State University, 1400 Lynch Street, Box18750, Jackson, Mississippi, MS 39217, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200512,Australia,J Cancer,Journal of Cancer,101535920,,,,PMC7255370,['NOTNLM'],"['DAXX', 'HAUSP', 'MDM2.', 'Trisenox', 'p53']",2020/06/04 06:00,2020/06/04 06:01,['2020/06/04 06:00'],"['2019/09/04 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/06/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/04 06:01 [medline]']","['10.7150/jca.39996 [doi]', 'jcav11p4373 [pii]']",epublish,J Cancer. 2020 May 12;11(15):4373-4383. doi: 10.7150/jca.39996. eCollection 2020.,,['Competing Interests: The authors have declared that no competing interest exists.'],['(c) The author(s).'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At the meeting, results from key studies in treatment-naive chronic lymphocytic leukemia (cll) were presented. Of those studies, phase iii oral presentations focused on the efficacy and safety of therapy with inhibitors of Bruton tyrosine kinase (btk) and Bcl-2. One presentation reported updated results of the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 1912 trial comparing the efficacy and safety of ibrutinib-rituximab with that of fludarabine-cyclophosphamide-rituximab in patients less than 70 years of age with cll. A second presentation reported interim results of the elevate tn trial, which is investigating the efficacy and safety of acalabrutinib-obinutuzumab or acalabrutinib monotherapy compared with chlorambucil-obinutuzumab. A third presentation reported on the single-agent zanubrutinib arm of the sequoia trial in patients with del(17p). The final presentation constituted a data update from the cll14 trial, which is evaluating fixed-duration venetoclax-obinutuzumab compared with chlorambucil-obinutuzumab, including the association of minimal residual disease status with progression-free survival. Our meeting report describes the foregoing studies and presents interviews with investigators and commentaries by Canadian hematologists about potential effects on Canadian practice.","['Banerji, V', 'Anglin, P', 'Christofides, A', 'Doucette, S', 'Laneuville, P']","['Banerji V', 'Anglin P', 'Christofides A', 'Doucette S', 'Laneuville P']","['University of Manitoba and CancerCare Manitoba, Winnipeg, MB.', 'Stronach Regional Cancer Centre, Southlake Regional Health Centre, Newmarket, ON.', 'impact Medicom Inc., Toronto, ON.', 'impact Medicom Inc., Toronto, ON.', 'McGill University Health Centre, Montreal, QC.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Conference', 'Historical Article', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200501,Switzerland,Curr Oncol,"Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",9502503,,IM,"['Aged', 'Female', 'Hematology/*organization & administration', 'History, 21st Century', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'United States']",PMC7253738,['NOTNLM'],"['*Chronic lymphocytic leukemia', '*treatment-naive disease', '*untreated disease']",2020/06/04 06:00,2021/03/26 06:00,['2020/06/04 06:00'],"['2020/06/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/06/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/26 06:00 [medline]']","['10.3747/co.27.6291 [doi]', 'conc-27-e231 [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Oncol. 2020 Apr;27(2):e231-e245. doi: 10.3747/co.27.6291.

Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in some genes, such as ARID5B and CDKN2B, are associated with the risk of childhood ALL. T-cell leukemia homeobox 1 (TLX1), a member of the HOX gene family, was identified based on its abnormal expression in T-lineage leukemia. This study aimed to determine whether TLX1 is associated with B-ALL and which SNP plays a significant role in ALL. METHODS: A total of 217 cases of ALL and 241 controls were included in this study. Six tag SNPs (rs75329544, rs946328, rs12415670, rs2075879, rs17113735, and rs1051723) were selected, and genotyping was carried out on Sequenom MassARRAY platform. RESULTS: Rs17113735 was possibly the risk locus associated with increased risk for ALL, whereas rs946328 was possibly associated with decreased risk for ALL. Moreover, rs17113735 was likely to be the risk locus for B-cell ALL (B-ALL), and rs2075879 was associated with decreased risk for B-ALL (P < .05). All SNPs in the two sample types (ALL and B-ALL samples) demonstrated linkage disequilibrium except between rs75329544 and rs2075879. Haplotype analysis showed no significant difference between the cases and controls in the two sample types. CONCLUSION: TLX1 gene polymorphisms are associated with ALL (rs17113735 and rs946328) and possibly play a significant role in B-ALL (rs17113735 and rs2075879). This work provides a reference for the diagnosis and therapy of this disease.","['Mei, Endian', 'Wei, Xubin', 'Gao, Jiadong', 'Tian, Xiaolong', 'Li, Wei', 'Liu, Li', 'Qian, Cheng']","['Mei E', 'Wei X', 'Gao J', 'Tian X', 'Li W', 'Liu L', 'Qian C']","['School of Life Sciences and Medicine, Zhejiang Sci-Tech University.

Fifty-one patients developed treatment-emergent AF; the risk of treatment-emergent AF at 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years was 9%, 12%, and 16%, respectively. The following were associated with an increased risk of treatment-emergent AF on multivariable analyses: past history of AF (hazard ratio [HR] 3.5, p = 0.0072) and heart failure (HR 3.4, p = 0.0028). Most patients are able to continue ibrutinib therapy (dose reduced in 43%). Development of treatment-emergent AF was associated with shorter event-free survival (EFS; HR 2.0, p = 0.02) and shorter overall survival (OS; HR 3.2, p = 0.001), after adjusting for age, prior treatment status, TP53 disruption, heart failure, valvular disease, and past history of AF. CONCLUSIONS: Patient comorbidities, rather than CLL-related factors, predict risk of treatment-emergent AF in patients treated with ibrutinib. Although the vast majority of patients with treatment-emergent AF are able to continue ibrutinib (with dose reduction in 43%), treatment-emergent AF appears to be associated with worse outcomes, independent of other adverse prognostic factors.","['Archibald, William J', 'Rabe, Kari G', 'Kabat, Brian F', 'Herrmann, Joerg', 'Ding, Wei', 'Kay, Neil E', 'Kenderian, Saad S', 'Muchtar, Eli', 'Leis, Jose F', 'Wang, Yucai', 'Chanan-Khan, Asher A', 'Schwager, Susan M', 'Koehler, Amber B', 'Fonder, Amie L', 'Slager, Susan L', 'Shanafelt, Tait D', 'Call, Timothy G', 'Parikh, Sameer A']","['Archibald WJ', 'Rabe KG', 'Kabat BF', 'Herrmann J', 'Ding W', 'Kay NE', 'Kenderian SS', 'Muchtar E', 'Leis JF', 'Wang Y', 'Chanan-Khan AA', 'Schwager SM', 'Koehler AB', 'Fonder AL', 'Slager SL', 'Shanafelt TD', 'Call TG', 'Parikh SA']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, 200 First St SW, Rochester, MN, 55905, USA. archibald.william@mayo.edu.', 'Division of Biomedical Statistics & Informatics, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Biomedical Statistics & Informatics, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Cardiology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, 200 First St SW, Rochester, MN, 55905, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, 200 First St SW, Rochester, MN, 55905, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, 200 First St SW, Rochester, MN, 55905, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, 200 First St SW, Rochester, MN, 55905, USA.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Mayo Clinic, Phoenix, AZ, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, 200 First St SW, Rochester, MN, 55905, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, FL, USA.', 'Division of Biomedical Statistics & Informatics, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, 200 First St SW, Rochester, MN, 55905, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, 200 First St SW, Rochester, MN, 55905, USA.', 'Division of Biomedical Statistics & Informatics, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Palo Alto, CA, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, 200 First St SW, Rochester, MN, 55905, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, 200 First St SW, Rochester, MN, 55905, USA.']",['eng'],['R01 CA233610/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['Journal Article'],20200601,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '1X70OSD4VX (ibrutinib)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",IM,"['Adenine/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Atrial Fibrillation/diagnosis/*drug therapy/*epidemiology', 'Disease Management', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/*drug therapy/*epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperidines/*therapeutic use', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Progression-Free Survival', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Atrial fibrillation', 'Chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'Ibrutinib', 'Small lymphocytic lymphoma']",2020/06/04 06:00,2021/01/14 06:00,['2020/06/04 06:00'],"['2019/12/01 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/14 06:00 [medline]', '2020/06/04 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00277-020-04094-3 [doi]', '10.1007/s00277-020-04094-3 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2021 Jan;100(1):143-155. doi: 10.1007/s00277-020-04094-3.

METHODS: Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients using nilotinib were followed for 12 months. Adherence was measured by Medication Event Monitoring System (MEMS), pill count, and Medication Adherence Report Scale (MARS-5). Nilotinib Cmin and patient-reported outcomes (i.e., quality of life, side effects, beliefs, satisfaction) were measured at baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months. RESULTS: Sixty-eight patients (57.5 +/- 15.0 years, 49% female) participated. Median adherence to nilotinib (MEMS and pill count) was >/= 99% and adherence < 90% was rare. Self-reported nonadherence (MARS-5) increased in the first year of treatment to a third of patients. In line with the strong beliefs in the necessity of taking nilotinib, forgetting to take a dose was more prevalent than intentionally adjusting/skipping doses. Nilotinib Cmin were generally above the therapeutic target in 95% of patients. Patients reported a variety of side effects, of which fatigue was most frequent. The mean Cmin was higher in patients who reported severe itching and fatigue. The overall 1-year MMR rate ranged from 47 to 71%. CONCLUSION: Substantial nonadherence (< 90%) to nilotinib was rare and nilotinib Cmin were generally above the therapeutic target. Lack of response in our group of patients was not related to nonadherence or inadequate Cmin. Nevertheless, a considerable number of patients experienced difficulties in adhering to the twice daily fasted dosing regimen, emphasizing the importance of continuous support of medication adherence in CML.

Here, we have assessed the feasibility of a tailored treatment strategy (TTS) guided by systematic parallel ex vivo DSRP and tNGS for patients with relapsed/refractory AML (number NCT02619071). A TTS issued by an institutional personalized committee could be achieved for 47/55 included patients (85%), 5 based on tNGS only, 6 on DSRP only, while 36 could be proposed on the basis of both, yielding more options and a better rationale. The TSS was available in <21 days for 28 patients (58.3%). On average, 3 to 4 potentially active drugs were selected per patient with only five patient samples being resistant to the entire drug panel. Seventeen patients received a TTS-guided treatment, resulting in four complete remissions, one partial remission, and five decreased peripheral blast counts. Our results show that chemogenomic combining tNGS with DSRP to determine a TTS is a promising approach to propose patient-specific treatment options within 21 days.","['Collignon, A', 'Hospital, M A', 'Montersino, C', 'Courtier, F', 'Charbonnier, A', 'Saillard, C', ""D'Incan, E"", 'Mohty, B', 'Guille, A', 'Adelaide, J', 'Carbuccia, N', 'Garnier, S', 'Mozziconacci, M J', 'Zemmour, C', 'Pakradouni, J', 'Restouin, A', 'Castellano, R', 'Chaffanet, M', 'Birnbaum, D', 'Collette, Y', 'Vey, N']","['Collignon A', 'Hospital MA', 'Montersino C', 'Courtier F', 'Charbonnier A', 'Saillard C', ""D'Incan E"", 'Mohty B', 'Guille A', 'Adelaide J', 'Carbuccia N', 'Garnier S', 'Mozziconacci MJ', 'Zemmour C', 'Pakradouni J', 'Restouin A', 'Castellano R', 'Chaffanet M', 'Birnbaum D', 'Collette Y', 'Vey N']","['Haematology Department, Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Aix-Marseille Universite, Marseille, France.', 'Haematology Department, Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Aix-Marseille Universite, Marseille, France.', 'Inserm, CNRS, Institut Paoli-Calmettes, CRCM, TrGET Preclinical Platform, Aix-Marseille Universite, Marseille, France.', 'Inserm, CNRS, Institut Paoli-Calmettes, CRCM, Predictive Oncology, Aix-Marseille Universite, Marseille, France.', 'Haematology Department, Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Aix-Marseille Universite, Marseille, France.', 'Haematology Department, Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Aix-Marseille Universite, Marseille, France.', 'Haematology Department, Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Aix-Marseille Universite, Marseille, France.', 'Haematology Department, Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Aix-Marseille Universite, Marseille, France.', 'Inserm, CNRS, Institut Paoli-Calmettes, CRCM, Predictive Oncology, Aix-Marseille Universite, Marseille, France.', 'Inserm, CNRS, Institut Paoli-Calmettes, CRCM, Predictive Oncology, Aix-Marseille Universite, Marseille, France.', 'Inserm, CNRS, Institut Paoli-Calmettes, CRCM, Predictive Oncology, Aix-Marseille Universite, Marseille, France.', 'Inserm, CNRS, Institut Paoli-Calmettes, CRCM, Predictive Oncology, Aix-Marseille Universite, Marseille, France.', 'Department of Biopathology, Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Marseille, France.', 'Department of Clinical Research & Innovation, Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Biostatistics & Methodology Unit, Aix Marseille Universite, INSERM, IRD, SESSTIM, Marseille, France.', 'Department of Clinical Research & Innovation, Sponsor Unit, Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Marseille, France.', 'Inserm, CNRS, Institut Paoli-Calmettes, CRCM, TrGET Preclinical Platform, Aix-Marseille Universite, Marseille, France.', 'Inserm, CNRS, Institut Paoli-Calmettes, CRCM, TrGET Preclinical Platform, Aix-Marseille Universite, Marseille, France.', 'Inserm, CNRS, Institut Paoli-Calmettes, CRCM, Predictive Oncology, Aix-Marseille Universite, Marseille, France.', 'Inserm, CNRS, Institut Paoli-Calmettes, CRCM, Predictive Oncology, Aix-Marseille Universite, Marseille, France. daniel.birnbaum@inserm.fr.', 'Inserm, CNRS, Institut Paoli-Calmettes, CRCM, TrGET Preclinical Platform, Aix-Marseille Universite, Marseille, France. yves.collette@inserm.fr.', 'Haematology Department, Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Aix-Marseille Universite, Marseille, France.

However, few studies have evaluated TRIO in children with leukemia and no guidelines for screening exist. This retrospective, observational cohort study in children with acute leukemia evaluates the prevalence of TRIO and its impact on end-organ function. RESULTS: The study included 139 patients; 60% standard-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), 32% high-risk (HR) ALL, and 9% acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The mean age at diagnosis was 6 years (range: 5 mo to 18 y). Patients with HR-ALL and AML were more likely to be transfused with >/=10 RBC units (59% and 92%, respectively) compared with those with standard-risk ALL (18%) (P<0.0001). Ferritin levels were measured in 68% patients and elevated (>1000 mcg/L) in 23%. Endocrinopathies were the most common end-organ abnormality. Hepatic dysfunction was significantly higher in patients with >/=10 RBC units transfused compared with those with <10 units (P=0.008). CONCLUSIONS: Although the RBC transfusion burden is highest in patients with AML and HR-ALL, TRIO screening was not commonly performed. Patients who receive >/=10 RBC units are at risk for hepatic and endocrine dysfunction. We recommend routine screening for TRIO in children with leukemia, who are at risk for a higher transfusion burden.","['Cacciotti, Chantel', 'Athale, Uma']","['Cacciotti C', 'Athale U']","[""Department of Pediatrics, McMaster Children's Hospital, Hamilton, ON, Canada."", ""Department of Pediatric Neuro-Oncology, Dana-Farber/Boston Children's Cancer and Blood Center, Boston, MA."", ""Department of Pediatrics, McMaster Children's Hospital, Hamilton, ON, Canada.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Observational Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Erythrocyte Transfusion/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Iron Overload/diagnosis/*etiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/pathology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/pathology/*therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies']",,,,2020/06/04 06:00,2021/04/07 06:00,['2020/06/04 06:00'],"['2020/06/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/07 06:00 [medline]', '2020/06/04 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/MPH.0000000000001849 [doi]', '00043426-202101000-00003 [pii]']",ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2021 Jan;43(1):18-23. doi: 10.1097/MPH.0000000000001849.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We also discuss how these new insights may help improve clinical management of germline mutations associated with leukemia. RECENT FINDINGS: Germline mutations may represent important initial mutations in the development of leukemia where interaction with somatic mutations provide further hits in leukemic progression. In addition, germline mutations may also contribute to leukemogenesis by impacting bone marrow stem-cell microenvironment and immune cell development and function. SUMMARY: Leukemia is characterized by the clonal expansion of malignant cells secondary to somatic or germline mutations in a variety of genes. Understanding somatic mutations that drive leukemogenesis has drastically improved our knowledge of leukemia biology and led to novel therapeutic strategies. Advances have also been made in identifying germline mutations that may affect leukemic development and progression. This review will discuss the biological and clinical relationship of germline mutations with clonal hematopoiesis, bone marrow microenvironment, and immunity in the progression of leukemia.","['Chen, Kevin Z', 'Kazi, Rafi', 'Porter, Christopher C', 'Qu, Cheng-Kui']","['Chen KZ', 'Kazi R', 'Porter CC', 'Qu CK']","['Laney Graduate School.', ""Department of Pediatrics, Division of Hematology and Oncology, Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia, USA."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Division of Hematology and Oncology, Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia, USA."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Division of Hematology and Oncology, Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia, USA.""]",['eng'],['R01 HL130995/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,,IM,"['*Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism/pathology', '*Carcinogenesis/genetics/metabolism/pathology', '*Germ-Line Mutation', 'Humans', '*Leukemia/genetics/metabolism/pathology', '*Neoplastic Stem Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Stem Cell Niche/*genetics', 'Tumor Microenvironment/*genetics']",PMC7362903,,,2020/06/04 06:00,2021/01/08 06:00,['2020/06/04 06:00'],"['2020/06/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/08 06:00 [medline]', '2020/06/04 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/MOH.0000000000000596 [doi]', '00062752-202007000-00011 [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2020 Jul;27(4):288-293. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0000000000000596.,,,,,,,,,,['NIHMS1602411'],,,,,,,,,

While the reason(s) for this requirement remains unclear, it is known that unintegrated proviral DNA is epigenetically silenced. Here, we demonstrate that human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) mutants lacking a functional integrase (IN) can mount a robust, spreading infection in cells expressing the Tax transcription factor encoded by human T-cell leukemia virus 1 (HTLV-1). In these cells, HIV-1 forms episomal DNA circles, analogous to hepatitis B virus (HBV) covalently closed circular DNAs (cccDNAs), that are transcriptionally active and fully capable of supporting viral replication. In the presence of Tax, induced NF-kappaB proteins are recruited to the long terminal repeat (LTR) promoters present on unintegrated HIV-1 DNA, and this recruitment in turn correlates with the loss of inhibitory epigenetic marks and the acquisition of activating marks on histones bound to viral DNA. Therefore, HIV-1 is capable of replication in the absence of integrase function if the epigenetic silencing of unintegrated viral DNA can be prevented or reversed.IMPORTANCE While retroviral DNA is synthesized normally after infection by integrase-deficient viruses, the resultant episomal DNA is then epigenetically silenced. Here, we show that expression of the Tax transcription factor encoded by a second human retrovirus, HTLV-1, prevents or reverses the epigenetic silencing of unintegrated HIV-1 DNA and instead induces the addition of activating epigenetic marks and the recruitment of NF-kappaB/Rel proteins to the HIV-1 LTR promoter. Moreover, in the presence of Tax, the HIV-1 DNA circles that form in the absence of integrase function are not only efficiently transcribed but also support a spreading, pathogenic integrase-deficient (IN(-)) HIV-1 infection. Thus, retroviruses have the potential to replicate without integration, as is indeed seen with HBV. Moreover, these data suggest that integrase inhibitors may be less effective in the treatment of HIV-1 infections in individuals who are also coinfected with HTLV-1.","['Irwan, Ishak D', 'Karnowski, Heather L', 'Bogerd, Hal P', 'Tsai, Kevin', 'Cullen, Bryan R']","['Irwan ID', 'Karnowski HL', 'Bogerd HP', 'Tsai K', 'Cullen BR']","['Department of Molecular Genetics and Microbiology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina, USA.', 'Department of Molecular Genetics and Microbiology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina, USA.', 'Department of Molecular Genetics and Microbiology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina, USA.', 'Department of Molecular Genetics and Microbiology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina, USA.', 'Department of Molecular Genetics and Microbiology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina, USA bryan.cullen@duke.edu.']",['eng'],['P30 AI064518/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20200602,United States,mBio,mBio,101519231,['EC 2.7.7.- (HIV Integrase)'],IM,"['A549 Cells', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Genes, pX/genetics', 'HEK293 Cells', 'HIV Integrase/*genetics', 'HIV-1/*genetics/physiology', 'HeLa Cells', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics', 'Humans', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'THP-1 Cells', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Virus Integration/*genetics', 'Virus Replication/*genetics']",PMC7267885,['NOTNLM'],"['*HIV-1', '*HTLV-1', '*NF-kappaB', '*Tax', '*cccDNA', '*epigenetic gene regulation', '*human T-cell leukemia virus', '*human immunodeficiency virus', '*integrase', '*integrase inhibitors']",2020/06/04 06:00,2021/04/13 06:00,['2020/06/04 06:00'],"['2020/06/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/06/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/13 06:00 [medline]']","['mBio.01038-20 [pii]', '10.1128/mBio.01038-20 [doi]']",epublish,mBio. 2020 Jun 2;11(3). pii: mBio.01038-20. doi: 10.1128/mBio.01038-20.,,,['Copyright (c) 2020 Irwan et al.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to clarify the activity of SIRT1 in leukemia cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The effects of SIRT1 inhibition or activation and SIRT1 knockdown or overexpression were examined in two T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) cell lines carrying NOTCH1 mutations and three acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines. RESULTS: The growth of T-ALL cells was promoted by SIRT1 inhibition and SIRT1 knockdown but was reduced by SIRT1 activation and overexpression; however, no effects were observed in AML cells. SIRT1 activation decreased NOTCH, NF-kappaB, and mTOR signaling and inhibited p53, suggesting that the possible mechanisms of T-ALL growth suppression by SIRT1 are independent of p53. CONCLUSION: SIRT1 activators acting through the down-regulation of NOTCH, NF-kappaB, and mTOR pathways can be novel targeted drugs for NOTCH1-mutated T-ALLs.","['Okasha, Salwa M', 'Itoh, Mai', 'Tohda, Shuji']","['Okasha SM', 'Itoh M', 'Tohda S']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan tohda.mlab@tmd.ac.jp.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (6-chloro-2,3,4,9-tetrahydro-1H-carbazole-1-carboxamide)', '0 (Carbazoles)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (NOTCH1 protein, human)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', '0 (Receptors, Notch)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 3.5.1.- (SIRT1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.1.- (Sirtuin 1)']",IM,"['Carbazoles/pharmacology', 'Cell Growth Processes/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Humans', 'Mutation', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Receptor, Notch1/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Notch/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Sirtuin 1/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/genetics/*metabolism', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism', 'Transfection']",,['NOTNLM'],"['NF-kappaB', 'NOTCH', 'Sirtuin1', 'leukemia', 'p53']",2020/06/04 06:00,2020/06/13 06:00,['2020/06/04 06:00'],"['2020/04/07 00:00 [received]', '2020/04/18 00:00 [revised]', '2020/04/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/06/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/13 06:00 [medline]']","['40/6/3155 [pii]', '10.21873/anticanres.14297 [doi]']",ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2020 Jun;40(6):3155-3161. doi: 10.21873/anticanres.14297.,,,"['Copyright(c) 2020, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.', 'Delinasios), All rights reserved.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we evaluated miRNAs associated with pediatric B-ALL early relapse in two independent sample sets. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed global miRNA profiling on diagnostic bone marrow specimens from six early relapse (</=3 years after diagnosis) and six age- and cytogenetics-matched prolonged remission (>/=4 years) patients (first set) and an independent set of 14 early relapse and 14 matched prolonged remission specimens (second set). RESULTS: Twelve and 39 top differentially expressed miRNAs were observed in the first and second sets, respectively; however, there was no overlap between the top candidates. In post-hoc analyses six miRNAs (miR-101-3p, miR-4774-5p, miR-1324, miR-631, miR-4699-5p and miR-922) among the top candidates in the second, but not the first set, were consistently upregulated in early relapse compared to remission specimens in both first (fold change=1.13-2.19, q<0.38) and second (fold change=1.48-4.78, all q<0.05) sets. Four (miR-631, mir-101-3p, miR-922 and miR-1324) of these miRNAs have been previously implicated in key functional oncogenic pathways in adult cancers. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that six candidate miRNAs, not previously implicated in pediatric ALL, are associated with early relapse in pediatric B-ALL. Validation and investigation of mechanistic roles of these miRNAs in a larger cohort are warranted, so that they may be used as prognostic markers for early relapse of pediatric B-ALL.","['Amankwah, Ernest K', 'Devidas, Meenakshi', 'Teachey, David T', 'Rabin, Karen R', 'Brown, Patrick A']","['Amankwah EK', 'Devidas M', 'Teachey DT', 'Rabin KR', 'Brown PA']","['Department of Oncology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, U.S.A. ernest.amankwah@jhmi.edu.', ""Cancer and Blood Disorders Institute, Johns Hopkins All Children's Hospital, St. Petersburg, FL, U.S.A."", ""Children's Oncology Group Data Center, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, U.S.A."", ""Pediatrics, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA, U.S.A."", ""Texas Children's Cancer and Hematology Centers, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, U.S.A."", 'Department of Oncology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, U.S.A.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, U.S.A.']",['eng'],"['U10 CA180886/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180899/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U24 CA196173/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['Journal Article'],,Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,['0 (MicroRNAs)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'B-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Recurrence']",PMC7722248,['NOTNLM'],"['ALL', 'Pediatric', 'epigenetic', 'miRNA', 'relapse']",2020/06/04 06:00,2020/06/13 06:00,['2020/06/04 06:00'],"['2020/04/06 00:00 [received]', '2020/04/14 00:00 [revised]', '2020/04/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/06/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/13 06:00 [medline]']","['40/6/3147 [pii]', '10.21873/anticanres.14296 [doi]']",ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2020 Jun;40(6):3147-3153. doi: 10.21873/anticanres.14296.,,,"['Copyright(c) 2020, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.', 'Delinasios), All rights reserved.']",,,,,,,['NIHMS1650697'],,,,,,,,,

Methods: Sixty-one patients with mediastinal T-LBL/ALL diagnosed at First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University from August 1, 2011 to December 31, 2018 were enrolled. Their clinical, pathological, imaging features and prognosis were retrospectively analyzed. Results: Of the 61 patients with mediastinal T-LBL/ALL, 46 were male and 15 were female, with a male to female ratio of approximately 3ratio1, aged 5 to 71 years (median 24 years, average of 24.5 years). Radiological findings were mediastinal soft tissue masses (58 cases) or mediastinal multiple enlarged lymph nodes (1 case). The tumor had a diameter of 4.9 to 18.3 cm in size, and data of 2 cases was unavailable. The patient's main symptoms were superior vena cava syndrome (cough, dyspnea, facial or neck edema), shortness of breath and chest pain, while about 1/3 of patients developed B symptoms (high fever, night sweats or significant weight loss). All 61 cases were biopsy specimens, and 2 of the tumors were later resected. Histopathologic examination showed that the thymic tissue epithelial network structure was destroyed or completely disappeared. A large number of lymphocytoid tumor cells were diffusely infiltrative, with infiltration into adipose tissue, starry sky phenomenon, linear-like arrangement, interstitial collagen hyperplasia and tumor cell extrusion. Focal tumor necrosis was present in some cases. Tumor cells were overall small to medium in size. They had little cytoplasm, slightly distorted, round or oval-shaped nuclei, fine chromatin, and innocuous/small nucleoli. Immunohistochemical studies showed that the tumor cells expressed CD7 (100%, 33/33), TDT (93.4%, 57/61), CD99 (83.3%, 25/30), CD1a (4/7), CD10 (8/18), CD34 (13.2%, 5/38), but did not express B cell markers (CD20 and PAX5) or granulocyte monocyte marker (MPO). The Ki-67 proliferation index was usually greater than 50%. One case was tested for TCR clonal rearrangement, which was positive. Several hemotherapy regiments were used. Hyper-CVAD (cyclophosphamide, vindesine, dexamethasone, and epirubicin) were most frequently administrated (60.4%, 32/53), followed by BFM-90 (50.9%, 27/53). Some patients were treated with the above two and other treatment options. Follow-up data were available in 55 of the 61 patients, and 26 patients (47.3%) survived. The average five-year survival rate was 50.6%. The patient's prognosis was not significantly related to the International Prognostic Index, age of onset, gender, or tumor size. Conclusions: The mediastinal T-LBL/ALL is rare, and most of its specimens are needle biopsies. The histological morphology is often difficult to interpret, while the addition of clinical features and immunohistochemistry may help. The combination of CKpan, TDT, CD99, CD7, CD3, PAX5, CD34, CD10, and Ki-67 immunohistochemicl studies may assist in diagnosis of the most cases.","['Gao, X Z', 'Wei, J G', 'Li, S L', 'Han, J', 'Wang, G N', 'Li, W C']","['Gao XZ', 'Wei JG', 'Li SL', 'Han J', 'Wang GN', 'Li WC']","['Department of Pathology, First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450052, China.', ""Department of Pathology, Shaoxing People's Hospital, Shaoxing 312000, China."", 'Department of Pathology, First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450052, China.', 'Department of Pathology, First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450052, China.', 'Department of Pathology, First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450052, China.', 'Department of Pathology, First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450052, China.']",['chi'],"['81372677/National Science Foundation of China', '132300410073/Henan Province Foundation and Front Engineering Research Project', '161100311400/Henan Province Major Science and Technology Project']",['Journal Article'],,China,Zhonghua Bing Li Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua bing li xue za zhi = Chinese journal of pathology,0005331,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', '*Mediastinal Neoplasms', 'Middle Aged', '*Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Young Adult']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Immunohistochemistry', 'Mediastinal neoplasms', 'Precursor cell lymphoblastic leukemia-lymphoma', 'Prognosis']",2020/06/04 06:00,2020/06/06 06:00,['2020/06/04 06:00'],"['2020/06/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/06/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3760/cma.j.cn112151-20190929-00538 [doi]'],ppublish,Zhonghua Bing Li Xue Za Zhi. 2020 Jun 8;49(6):601-606. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.cn112151-20190929-00538.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Their number, shape, and dynamism are controlled by the cell's type and current behavior. The perturbation of the mitochondrial inward system via stress response and/or oncogenic insults could activate several trafficking molecular mechanisms with the intention to solve the problem. In this review, we aimed to clarify the crucial pathways in the mitochondrial system, dissecting the different metabolic defects, with a special emphasis on hematological malignancies. We investigated the pivotal role of mitochondria in the maintenance of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and their main alterations that could induce malignant transformation, culminating in the generation of leukemic stem cells (LSCs). In addition, we presented an overview of LSCs mitochondrial dysregulated mechanisms in terms of (1) increasing in oxidative phosphorylation program (OXPHOS), as a crucial process for survival and self-renewal of LSCs,(2) low levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and (3) aberrant expression of B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) with sustained mitophagy. Furthermore, these peculiarities may represent attractive new ""hot spots"" for mitochondrial-targeted therapy. Finally, we remark the potential of the LCS metabolic effectors to be exploited as novel therapeutic targets.","['Panuzzo, Cristina', 'Jovanovski, Aleksandar', 'Pergolizzi, Barbara', 'Pironi, Lucrezia', 'Stanga, Serena', 'Fava, Carmen', 'Cilloni, Daniela']","['Panuzzo C', 'Jovanovski A', 'Pergolizzi B', 'Pironi L', 'Stanga S', 'Fava C', 'Cilloni D']","['Department of Clinical and Biological Sciences, University of Turin, Orbassano, 10043, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical and Biological Sciences, University of Turin, Orbassano, 10043, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical and Biological Sciences, University of Turin, Orbassano, 10043, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical and Biological Sciences, University of Turin, Orbassano, 10043, Italy.', 'Department of Neuroscience Rita Levi Montalcini, Turin 10124, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical and Biological Sciences, University of Turin, Orbassano, 10043, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical and Biological Sciences, University of Turin, Orbassano, 10043, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200530,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,"['0 (BCL2 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cell Survival', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mitochondria/*metabolism', 'Mitophagy', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Oxidative Phosphorylation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction']",PMC7312164,['NOTNLM'],"['apoptosis', 'hematopoietic stem cell', 'leukemia', 'leukemic stem cell', 'mitochondria', 'mitochondrial dysfunction', 'mitochondrial targeted therapy', 'mitophagy', 'oxidative phosphorylation program', 'reactive oxygen species (ROS)']",2020/06/04 06:00,2021/04/01 06:00,['2020/06/04 06:00'],"['2020/04/29 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/24 00:00 [revised]', '2020/05/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/06/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/01 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms21113928 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms21113928 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2020 May 30;21(11). pii: ijms21113928. doi: 10.3390/ijms21113928.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Albendazole (ABZ), a benzimidazole anthelmintic, shows microtubule-destabilizing activity and has been repositioned for cancer therapies. To clarify the role of MCL1 in ABZ-induced apoptosis, we investigated the cytotoxicity of ABZ on human leukemia K562 cells. Treatment with ABZ for 24 h did not appreciably induce apoptosis or mitochondrial depolarization in K562 cells, though it caused the mitotic arrest of K562 cells. ABZ-evoked p38 MAPK activation concurrently suppressed Sp1-mediated MCL1 expression and increased SIRT3 mRNA stability and protein expression. ABZ and A-1210477 (an MCL1 inhibitor) enhanced the cytotoxicity of ABT-263 (a BCL2/BCL2L1 inhibitor) to their effect on MCL1 suppression. Unlike ABZ, A-1210477 did not affect SIRT3 expression and reduced the survival of K562 cells. Overexpression of SIRT3 attenuated the A-1210477 cytotoxicity on K562 cells. ABZ treatment elicited marked apoptosis and DeltaPsim loss in ABT-263-resistant K562 (K562/R) cells, but did not alter SIRT3 expression. Ectopic expression of SIRT3 alleviated the cytotoxicity of ABZ on K562/R cells. Collectively, our data demonstrate that ABZ-induced SIRT3 upregulation delays the apoptosis-inducing effect of MCL1 suppression on apoptosis induction in K562 cells.","['Wang, Liang-Jun', 'Liou, Li-Ren', 'Shi, Yi-Jun', 'Chiou, Jing-Ting', 'Lee, Yuan-Chin', 'Huang, Chia-Hui', 'Huang, Po-Wei', 'Chang, Long-Sen']","['Wang LJ', 'Liou LR', 'Shi YJ', 'Chiou JT', 'Lee YC', 'Huang CH', 'Huang PW', 'Chang LS']","['Institute of Biomedical Sciences, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung 804, Taiwan.', 'Department of Surgery, Zuoying Branch of Kaohsiung Armed Forces General Hospital, Kaohsiung 813, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Biomedical Sciences, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung 804, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Biomedical Sciences, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung 804, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Biomedical Sciences, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung 804, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Biomedical Sciences, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung 804, Taiwan.', 'Department of Surgery, Zuoying Branch of Kaohsiung Armed Forces General Hospital, Kaohsiung 813, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Biomedical Sciences, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung 804, Taiwan.', 'Department of Biotechnology, Kaohsiung Medical University, Kaohsiung 807, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['MOST106-2320-B110-002-MY3/Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan', 'ZBH 107-14/Zuoying Branch of Kaohsiung Armed Forces General Hospital']",['Journal Article'],20200530,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,"['0 (A-1210477)', '0 (Aniline Compounds)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0 (Tubulin Modulators)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.5.1.- (SIRT3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.1.- (Sirtuin 3)', 'F4216019LN (Albendazole)', 'XKJ5VVK2WD (navitoclax)']",IM,"['Albendazole/*pharmacology', 'Aniline Compounds/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Cycle', 'Humans', 'Indoles/pharmacology', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Sirtuin 3/*metabolism', 'Sulfonamides/pharmacology', 'Tubulin Modulators/pharmacology', 'Up-Regulation', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism']",PMC7312678,['NOTNLM'],"['MCL1', 'SIRT3', 'albendazole', 'apoptosis', 'leukemia']",2020/06/04 06:00,2021/03/31 06:00,['2020/06/04 06:00'],"['2020/04/24 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/20 00:00 [revised]', '2020/05/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/06/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/31 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms21113907 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms21113907 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2020 May 30;21(11). pii: ijms21113907. doi: 10.3390/ijms21113907.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Currently, two CAR-T-cell-based therapies, Tisagenlecleucel and Axicabtagene ciloleucel, are approved by FDA for the treatment of hematological malignancies, acute lymphoblastic leukemia and large B-cell lymphomas. Their approval has been a culmination of several phase I and II clinical studies, which are the subject of discussion in this review article. Over the years, CAR-T cells have evolved to be significantly more persistent in patients' blood, resulting in a much-improved clinical response and disease remission. This is particularly significant given that the target patient populations of these therapies are those with relapsed and refractory disease who have often progressed on multiple therapies. Despite the promising clinical results, there are still several challenges that need to be addressed. Of particular note are the associated toxicities exemplified by cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and the neurotoxicity. CRS has been addressed by an FDA-approved therapy of its own-tocilizumab. This article focuses on the progress related to CAR-T therapy: the pertinent clinical studies and their major findings, their associated adverse effects, and future perspective.","['Ahmad, Aamir', 'Uddin, Shahab', 'Steinhoff, Martin']","['Ahmad A', 'Uddin S', 'Steinhoff M']","['School of Medicine, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL 35233, USA.', 'Translational Research Institute, Academic Health System, Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha 3050, Qatar.', 'Department of Dermatology and Venereology and Dermatology Institute, Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha 3050, Qatar.', 'Translational Research Institute, Academic Health System, Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha 3050, Qatar.', 'Department of Dermatology and Venereology and Dermatology Institute, Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha 3050, Qatar.', 'Department of Dermatology, Weill Cornell Medicine-Qatar, Qatar Foundation-Education City, Doha 24144, Qatar.', 'College of Medicine, Qatar University, Doha 2713, Qatar.', 'Department of Dermatology, Weill Cornell Medicine, 1300 York Avenue, New York, NY 10065, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200530,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Biological Products)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', 'I031V2H011 (tocilizumab)', 'Q6C9WHR03O (tisagenlecleucel)', 'U2I8T43Y7R (axicabtagene ciloleucel)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/therapeutic use', 'Antigens, CD19/therapeutic use', 'Biological Products', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Cytokines/metabolism', '*Drug Approval', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/*methods', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*therapy', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/therapeutic use', 'Remission Induction']",PMC7312930,['NOTNLM'],"['CAR-T cell therapy', 'axicabtagene ciloleucel', 'cytokine release syndrome', 'tisagenlecleucel', 'tocilizumab']",2020/06/04 06:00,2021/03/31 06:00,['2020/06/04 06:00'],"['2020/05/22 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/06/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/31 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms21113906 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms21113906 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2020 May 30;21(11). pii: ijms21113906. doi: 10.3390/ijms21113906.,"['ORCID: 0000-0003-1784-5723', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1886-6710']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the ABL kinase inhibitor (imatinib) has proven to be very effective in achieving high remission rates and improving prognosis, up to 33% of CML patients still cannot achieve an optimal response. Here, we used CRISPR/Cas9 to specifically target the BCR-ABL junction region in K562 cells, resulting in the inhibition of cancer cell growth and oncogenesis. Due to the variety of BCR-ABL junctions in CML patients, we utilized gene editing of the human ABL gene for clinical applications. Using the ABL gene-edited virus in K562 cells, we detected 41.2% indels in ABL sgRNA_2-infected cells. The ABL-edited cells reveled significant suppression of BCR-ABL protein expression and downstream signals, inhibiting cell growth and increasing cell apoptosis. Next, we introduced the ABL gene-edited virus into a systemic K562 leukemia xenograft mouse model, and bioluminescence imaging of the mice showed a significant reduction in the leukemia cell population in ABL-targeted mice, compared to the scramble sgRNA virus-injected mice. In CML cells from clinical samples, infection with the ABL gene-edited virus resulted in more than 30.9% indels and significant cancer cell death.

However, the association between AIHA and chronic myelogenous leukemia is extremely unusual. SUMMARY: We reviewed case reports and series of 54 patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) who developed autoimmune hemolysis between 1952 and 2018. Almost all the patients were in the chronic phase and were classified into transplant and non-transplant groups. The onset of autoimmune hemolysis was earlier in the transplant group and required second- and third-line therapy to control it. The etiology of hemolysis is poorly understood but attributed in the transplant group to immune reconstitution, viral infections, or CML relapse. On the other hand, it is thought to be related in the non-transplant group to CML medications, especially interferon. Key Messages: Although AIHA is uncommon in chronic myelogenous leukemia patients, it should be in the differential diagnosis list for those who develop a sudden drop in hemoglobin without a bleeding source.","['Hamamyh, Tahseen', 'Yassin, Mohamed A']","['Hamamyh T', 'Yassin MA']","['Department of Medical Education, Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar, tahseenth88@gmail.com.', 'Department of Medical Oncology/Hematology Section, National Center for Cancer Care and Research, Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200602,Switzerland,Pharmacology,Pharmacology,0152016,['9008-11-1 (Interferons)'],IM,"['Anemia, Hemolytic, Autoimmune/*etiology/*therapy', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Immune Reconstitution/immunology', 'Interferons/adverse effects', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*complications/*therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Virus Diseases/complications']",PMC7845422,['NOTNLM'],"['Autoimmune hemolytic anemia', 'Chronic myeloid leukemia', 'Imatinib', 'Interferon', 'Tyrosine kinase inhibitors']",2020/06/03 06:00,2021/03/18 06:00,['2020/06/03 06:00'],"['2020/01/16 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/18 06:00 [medline]', '2020/06/03 06:00 [entrez]']","['000507295 [pii]', '10.1159/000507295 [doi]']",ppublish,Pharmacology. 2020;105(11-12):630-638. doi: 10.1159/000507295.

Various cancer therapies, such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy and phototherapy, kill solid tumors through non-inflammatory apoptosis or ablation, rather than making solid tumors immunogenic. As a highly-inflammatory programmed cell death (PCD), pyroptosis provides a great opportunity to alleviate immunosuppression and promote a systemic immune response in treating solid tumors. Herein, by fusing breast cancer membrane onto the poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) polymeric core, we design a biomimetic nanoparticle (BNP) loaded with indocyanine green (ICG) and decitabine (DCT) for photo-activated cancer cell pyroptosis and solid tumor immunotherapy. The tumor-homing BNP effectively accumulate in tumor with low immunogenicity. ICG in BNP puncture cancer cell membranes induces a sharp cytoplasm Ca2+ concentration increase by low-dose NIR photo-activation, which promotes cytochrome c release followed by caspase-3 activation. DCT up-regulates GSDME expression synergistically via inhibiting DNA methylation, which enhances caspase-3 cleavage to GSDME and causes cancer cell pyroptosis. Finally, photo-activated pyroptosis mediated by BNP induces an impressive systemic antitumor immunity for inhibition of both primary tumor and distant tumors. Overall, pyroptosis-associated BNP shows a novel strategy for solid tumor immunotherapy with high compatibility and wide clinical applicability.","['Zhao, Pengfei', 'Wang, Meng', 'Chen, Mian', 'Chen, Ze', 'Peng, Xiao', 'Zhou, Feifan', 'Song, Jun', 'Qu, Junle']","['Zhao P', 'Wang M', 'Chen M', 'Chen Z', 'Peng X', 'Zhou F', 'Song J', 'Qu J']","['Key Laboratory of Optoelectronic Devices and Systems of Ministry of Education and Guangdong Province, College of Physics and Optoelectronic Engineering, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, 518060, PR China.', 'Key Laboratory of Optoelectronic Devices and Systems of Ministry of Education and Guangdong Province, College of Physics and Optoelectronic Engineering, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, 518060, PR China.', 'Department of Biomedical Engineering, School of Medicine, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, 518060, PR China.', 'Guangdong Key Laboratory of Nanomedicine, CAS Key Lab for Health Informatics, CAS-HK Joint Lab of Biomaterials, Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology (SIAT), Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenzhen, 518055, PR China.', 'Key Laboratory of Optoelectronic Devices and Systems of Ministry of Education and Guangdong Province, College of Physics and Optoelectronic Engineering, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, 518060, PR China.', 'Key Laboratory of Optoelectronic Devices and Systems of Ministry of Education and Guangdong Province, College of Physics and Optoelectronic Engineering, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, 518060, PR China.

Artemisinin (ARS)-type compounds exhibit excellent antimalarial effects with few side effects and drug-resistance. ARS and its derivatives were also reported to act against various tumor types in vitro and in vivo, including acute leukemia. Therefore, ARS-type compounds may be exquisitely suitable for repurposing in leukemia treatment. To provide comprehensive clues of ARS and its derivatives for acute leukemia treatment, their molecular mechanisms are discussed in this review. Five monomeric molecules and 72 dimers, trimers and hybrids based on the ARS scaffold have been described against acute leukemia. The modes of action involve anti-angiogenic, anti-metastatic and growth inhibitory effects. These properties make ARS-type compounds as potential candidates for the treatment of acute leukemia. Still, more potent and target-selective ARS-type compounds need to be developed.","['Lu, Xiaohua', 'Efferth, Thomas']","['Lu X', 'Efferth T']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Biology, Institute of Pharmacy and Biomedical Sciences, Johannes Gutenberg University, Staudinger Weg 5, 55128 Mainz, Germany.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Biology, Institute of Pharmacy and Biomedical Sciences, Johannes Gutenberg University, Staudinger Weg 5, 55128 Mainz, Germany.

We have recently demonstrated the in vivo generation of CD19-CAR T cells using the CD8-targeted lentiviral vector (CD8-LV). In this study, we investigated the in vivo generation of CD4(+) CAR T cells using CD4-targeted LV (CD4-LV). Administration of CD4-LV into NSG mice transplanted with human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) led to 40%-60% of human CD4(+) lymphocytes being CAR positive while CD8(+) cells remained CAR negative. CAR(+) T cells displayed a T helper 1 (Th1)/Th2 phenotype, which was accompanied by CD19(+) B cell elimination. Intravenous administration of CD4-LV into NSG mice reconstituted with human CD34(+) cells induced CAR expression and B cell elimination within 2-3 weeks post-injection. Preclinical analysis in a tumor mouse model revealed that mice administered CD4-LV exhibited faster and superior tumor cell killing compared to mice injected with CD8-LV alone or as a mixture with CD4-LV. Further analysis suggests that CD4(+)CAR(+) cells may outperform CD8(+)CAR(+) cells, especially at a high burden of target antigen, mainly since CD8 cells are more prone to exhaustion. This first description of in vivo-generated CD4(+) CAR T cells supports their importance for cellular therapy.","['Agarwal, Shiwani', 'Hanauer, Julia D S', 'Frank, Annika M', 'Riechert, Vanessa', 'Thalheimer, Frederic B', 'Buchholz, Christian J']","['Agarwal S', 'Hanauer JDS', 'Frank AM', 'Riechert V', 'Thalheimer FB', 'Buchholz CJ']","['Molecular Biotechnology and Gene Therapy, Paul-Ehrlich-Institut, 63225 Langen, Germany.', 'Molecular Biotechnology and Gene Therapy, Paul-Ehrlich-Institut, 63225 Langen, Germany.', 'Division for Medical Biotechnology, Paul-Ehrlich-Institut, Langen, Germany; Frankfurt Cancer Institute, Goethe University, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Molecular Biotechnology and Gene Therapy, Paul-Ehrlich-Institut, 63225 Langen, Germany.', 'Molecular Biotechnology and Gene Therapy, Paul-Ehrlich-Institut, 63225 Langen, Germany.', 'Molecular Biotechnology and Gene Therapy, Paul-Ehrlich-Institut, 63225 Langen, Germany; Division for Medical Biotechnology, Paul-Ehrlich-Institut, Langen, Germany; Frankfurt Cancer Institute, Goethe University, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.

This study aims to evaluate the prognostic value of PLR in patients with MDS. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Clinical-laboratory findings and the results of bone marrow biopsies of MDS patients before treatment were recorded. p value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. SPSS version 20.0 was used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: The study included 62 patients with median follow-up time of 62.8+/-4.5 months and median age of 68.5 years. In 13 patients, acute leukemia was transformed. In these subjects, a PLR cut-off level of 46 was established for mortality (p=0.015). We found a significant relationship between PLR and multilineage series with the presence of dysplasia (p=0.017). The survival analysis showed a decreased survival in cases with dysplasia in two and/or more series, transformation into acute leukemia, and thrombocytopenia. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated that there was a relationship between PLR and MDS with multilineage dysplasia (mld-MDS). PLR is investigated as an inflammatory finding in various hematologic malignancies. Further studies investigating the value of PLR in MDS are needed to determine whether PLR may be a marker of bone marrow dysplasia grading (Tab. 2, Fig. 4, Ref. 32).","['Yikilmaz, A S', 'Akinci, S', 'Bakanay, S M', 'Dilek, I']","['Yikilmaz AS', 'Akinci S', 'Bakanay SM', 'Dilek I']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Slovakia,Bratisl Lek Listy,Bratislavske lekarske listy,0065324,,IM,"['Aged', 'Bone Marrow', 'Humans', 'Leukemia', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Lymphocytes', '*Myelodysplastic Syndromes/diagnosis', '*Platelet Count', 'Prognosis']",,['NOTNLM'],"['acute leukemia thrombocytopenia.', 'cellular differentiation', 'chronic cytopenia', 'hematologic abnormalities', 'marrow biopsy', 'myelodysplastic syndromes']",2020/06/03 06:00,2020/09/15 06:00,['2020/06/03 06:00'],"['2020/06/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/06/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.4149/BLL_2020_068 [doi]'],ppublish,Bratisl Lek Listy. 2020;121(6):422-427. doi: 10.4149/BLL_2020_068.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We show here in prostate cancer cells that increased NOXA, mediated by kinase inhibitor activation of an integrated stress response, drives the degradation of MCL1, and identify the mitochondria-associated ubiquitin ligase MARCH5 as the primary mediator of this NOXA-dependent MCL1 degradation. Therapies that enhance MARCH5-mediated MCL1 degradation markedly enhance apoptosis in response to a BH3 mimetic agent targeting BCLXL, which may provide for a broadly effective therapy in solid tumors. Conversely, increased MCL1 in response to MARCH5 loss does not strongly sensitize to BH3 mimetic drugs targeting MCL1, but instead also sensitizes to BCLXL inhibition, revealing a codependence between MARCH5 and MCL1 that may also be exploited in tumors with MARCH5 genomic loss.","['Arai, Seiji', 'Varkaris, Andreas', 'Nouri, Mannan', 'Chen, Sen', 'Xie, Lisha', 'Balk, Steven P']","['Arai S', 'Varkaris A', 'Nouri M', 'Chen S', 'Xie L', 'Balk SP']","['Hematology-Oncology Division, Department of Medicine, and Cancer Center, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Harvard Medical School, Boston, United States.', 'Department of Urology, Gunma University Hospital, Maebashi, Japan.', 'Hematology-Oncology Division, Department of Medicine, and Cancer Center, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Harvard Medical School, Boston, United States.', 'Hematology-Oncology Division, Department of Medicine, and Cancer Center, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Harvard Medical School, Boston, United States.', 'Hematology-Oncology Division, Department of Medicine, and Cancer Center, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Harvard Medical School, Boston, United States.', 'Hematology-Oncology Division, Department of Medicine, and Cancer Center, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Harvard Medical School, Boston, United States.', 'Hematology-Oncology Division, Department of Medicine, and Cancer Center, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Harvard Medical School, Boston, United States.']",['eng'],"['P01 CA163227/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'W81XWH-16-1-0431/Congressionally Directed Medical Research Programs/International', '20K09518/JSPS/International', 'W81XWH-18-1-0379/Congressionally Directed Medical Research Programs/International', 'P50 CA090381/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20200602,England,Elife,eLife,101579614,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (PMAIP1 protein, human)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (MARCHF5 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mitochondria/metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Proteolysis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/*metabolism', 'Stress, Physiological', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Ubiquitination', 'Up-Regulation']",PMC7297531,['NOTNLM'],"['*BCLXL', '*MARCH5', '*MCL1', '*NOXA', '*apoptosis', '*cancer biology', '*human', '*integrated stress response']",2020/06/03 06:00,2021/03/24 06:00,['2020/06/03 06:00'],"['2020/01/07 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/24 06:00 [medline]', '2020/06/03 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.7554/eLife.54954 [doi]', '54954 [pii]']",epublish,Elife. 2020 Jun 2;9. pii: 54954. doi: 10.7554/eLife.54954.,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-9514-735X', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5776-8844', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4546-7371']","['SA, AV, MN, SC, LX, SB No competing interests declared']","['(c) 2020, Arai et al.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Formulation with nano-size may be an alternative therapy for women with ovulatory disorders. In this study, we investigated sustained-release clomiphene citrate by using Phosal-based formulation (PBF) and evaluate its decreased side effect on the endometrial receptivity. METHODS: In the in-vitro study, CC loaded PBF was analyzed using Zetasizer, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and Transmission electron microscopy (TEM). In the in-vivo study, 24 female mice were randomly divided into three groups: CC (5 mg/kg), CC/PBF (5 mg/kg) and SS (1 ml) daily administered and injected with 5 IU HCG and mated after two days. At day 4.5, pregnant mice were euthanized and endometrial tissue was extracted for quantitative polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR) analysis. RESULTS: The optimized PBF contained Phosal 50PG/glycerol in a 2:8 ratios (w/w) and the particle size of optimum formulation was 67 +/- 0.30551 nm and the release of CC from CC-containing PBF was slightly faster in the first 24 h; wherein, 29% of CC was released, and 76% of CC was released up to 120 h. The mRNA levels of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), leukemia inhibitory factor receptor alpha (LIFR), HOXA10, Heparin-binding epidermal growth factor (HB-EGF), and epidermal growth factor (EGF) were significantly upregulated and MUC1 and PGR mRNA levels were significantly downregulated in the CC-containing PBF-treated animals compared with only CC group (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Sustained release formulation of clomiphene citrate increased its targeting efficiency and improved the impact of the CC on implantation. Graphical abstract A new Phosal Based Formulation (PBF) was designed to decrease the side effects of Clomiphene citrate (CC) on endometrium. This drug formulation could react better during implantation by increasing the expression of genes involved in implantation. The in vivo study demonstrated that the CC-containing PBF in mice has a significantly higher endometrial receptivity, compared with the suspension.","['Ajdary, Marziyeh', 'Keyhanfar, Fariborz', 'Aflatoonian, Reza', 'Amani, Amir', 'Amjadi, FatemehSadat', 'Zandieh, Zahra', 'Mehdizadeh, Mehdi']","['Ajdary M', 'Keyhanfar F', 'Aflatoonian R', 'Amani A', 'Amjadi F', 'Zandieh Z', 'Mehdizadeh M']","['Cellular and Molecular Research Center, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Pharmacology, School of Medicine, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Endocrinology and Female Infertility, Reproductive Biomedicine Research Center, Royan Institute for Reproductive Biomedicine, ACECR, Tehran, Iran.', 'Natural Products and Medicinal Plants Research Center, North Khorasan University of Medical Sciences, Bojnurd, Iran.', 'Department of Medical Nanotechnology, School of Advanced Technologies in Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Anatomical Science, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Anatomical Science, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Cellular and Molecular Research Center, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran. mehdizadeh.m@iums.ac.ir.', 'Department of Anatomical Science, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran. mehdizadeh.m@iums.ac.ir.']",['eng'],['94-05-117-27524/Iran University of Science and Technology'],['Journal Article'],20200602,Switzerland,Daru,"Daru : journal of Faculty of Pharmacy, Tehran University of Medical Sciences",101125969,"['0 (Delayed-Action Preparations)', '0 (Fertility Agents, Female)', '0 (Genetic Markers)', '1HRS458QU2 (Clomiphene)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Clomiphene/*adverse effects/chemistry', 'Delayed-Action Preparations', 'Drug Compounding', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Endometrium/chemistry/*drug effects', 'Female', 'Fertility Agents, Female/*adverse effects', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Genetic Markers/*drug effects', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Models, Animal', 'Nanoparticles', 'Particle Size', 'Pregnancy']",PMC7704853,['NOTNLM'],"['Clomiphene citrate', 'Endometrial receptivity', 'Phosal-based formulation', 'Sustained release']",2020/06/03 06:00,2021/08/28 06:00,['2020/06/03 06:00'],"['2019/03/20 00:00 [received]', '2019/10/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/28 06:00 [medline]', '2020/06/03 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s40199-019-00310-2 [doi]', '10.1007/s40199-019-00310-2 [pii]']",ppublish,Daru. 2020 Dec;28(2):423-432. doi: 10.1007/s40199-019-00310-2.

Real-life data suggest a large part of discontinuations are due to toxicities, impairing ibrutinib efficacy. We aimed to assess the impact of a pharmaceutical care program on the efficacy and safety of ibrutinib. This single-center, cohort, observational study enrolled patients with B cell malignancies. Patients were either assigned to the program or to receive usual care, based on physician decision. The program was conducted by clinical pharmacists specializing in oncology and included patient education for management of toxicities, adherence monitoring, interventions to reduce drug-drug interactions, and follow-up of transition from hospital to community. Between February 2014 and May 2017, we enrolled 155 patients, including 42 (27%) who were allocated to the program group and 113 (73%) to the usual care group. The effect of the program was beneficial in terms of time to treatment failure (p = 0.0005). The 30-month progression-free and overall survivals were significantly superior in the program group (respectively p = 0.002 and p = 0.004). Grade 3 or higher adverse events occurred more frequently for patients in the usual care group (15%) than program group (8%). A pharmaceutical care program provides a personalized environment for outpatient monitoring and control of the key risks associated with oral anticancer agents. This study shows evidence that management of ibrutinib treatment by clinical pharmacists results in significant improvement in survival and better tolerance than usual care.","['Zerbit, Jeremie', 'Chevret, Sylvie', 'Bernard, Sophie', 'Kroemer, Marie', 'Ablard, Charlotte', 'Harel, Stephanie', 'Brice, Pauline', 'Madelaine, Isabelle', 'Thieblemont, Catherine']","['Zerbit J', 'Chevret S', 'Bernard S', 'Kroemer M', 'Ablard C', 'Harel S', 'Brice P', 'Madelaine I', 'Thieblemont C']","['Pharmacy Department, APHP, Saint-Louis Hospital, Paris, France.', 'Department of Biostatistics and Medical Information, APHP, Saint-Louis Hospital, Paris, France.', 'Paris Diderot University, Sorbonne Paris-Cite, Paris, France.', 'Hemato-Oncology Department, APHP, Saint-Louis Hospital, 1, Avenue Claude Vellefaux, 75010, Paris, France.', 'Pharmacy Department, University Hospital Center of Besancon, Besancon, France.', 'Pharmacy Department, APHP, Saint-Louis Hospital, Paris, France.', 'Immuno-Hematology Department, APHP, Saint-Louis Hospital, Paris, France.', 'Hemato-Oncology Department, APHP, Saint-Louis Hospital, 1, Avenue Claude Vellefaux, 75010, Paris, France.', 'Pharmacy Department, APHP, Saint-Louis Hospital, Paris, France.', 'Paris Diderot University, Sorbonne Paris-Cite, Paris, France. catherine.thieblemont@aphp.fr.', 'Hemato-Oncology Department, APHP, Saint-Louis Hospital, 1, Avenue Claude Vellefaux, 75010, Paris, France. catherine.thieblemont@aphp.fr.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Observational Study']",20200601,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '1X70OSD4VX (ibrutinib)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",IM,"['Adenine/analogs & derivatives', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cohort Studies', 'Efficiency, Organizational', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/*mortality', 'Pharmaceutical Services/organization & administration/*standards/trends', 'Pharmacists/organization & administration/standards', 'Piperidines', 'Pyrazoles/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', '*Quality Improvement', 'Survival Analysis', 'Time Factors', 'Time-to-Treatment/organization & administration/*standards/trends', 'Treatment Failure']",PMC7316844,['NOTNLM'],"['Education', 'Ibrutinib', 'Leukemia', 'Lymphoma', 'Pharmacist', 'Survival']",2020/06/03 06:00,2020/07/24 06:00,['2020/06/03 06:00'],"['2020/01/31 00:00 [received]', '2020/04/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/24 06:00 [medline]', '2020/06/03 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00277-020-04045-y [doi]', '10.1007/s00277-020-04045-y [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2020 Jul;99(7):1615-1625. doi: 10.1007/s00277-020-04045-y.

Allogeneic, HLA-mismatched off-the-shelf third-party donors may offer ideal fitness of the effector cells, but carry the risk of graft-versus-host disease. Knockout (KO) of the endogenous T-cell receptor (TCR) in CD19-CAR-T cells may be a promising solution. Here, we induced a CRISPR/Cas9-mediated KO of the TCRbeta chain in combination with a second-generation retroviral CAR transduction including a 4-1BB costimulatory domain in primary T cells. This tandem engineering led to a highly functional population of TCR-KO-CAR-T cells with strong activation (CD25, interferon gamma), proliferation, and specific killing upon CD19 target recognition. TCR-KO-CAR-T cells had a balanced phenotype of central memory and effector memory T cells. KO of the endogenous TCR in T cells strongly ablated alloreactivity in comparison with TCR-expressing T cells. In a patient-derived xenograft model of childhood ALL, TCR-KO-CAR-T cells clearly controlled CD19+ leukemia burden and improved survival in vivo. However, coexpression of endogenous TCR plus CAR led to superior persistence of T cells and significantly prolonged leukemia control in vivo, confirmed by a second in vivo model using the leukemia cell line NALM6. These results point toward an essential role of the endogenous TCR for longevity of the response at the price of alloreactivity. In conclusion, anti-CD19 CAR T cells with a CRISPR/Cas9-mediated TCR-KO are promising candidates for nonmatched third-party adoptive T-cell transfer with high antileukemic functionality in the absence of alloreactivity, but long-term persistence in vivo is better in the presence of the endogenous TCR.","['Stenger, Dana', 'Stief, Tanja A', 'Kaeuferle, Theresa', 'Willier, Semjon', 'Rataj, Felicitas', 'Schober, Kilian', 'Vick, Binje', 'Lotfi, Ramin', 'Wagner, Beate', 'Grunewald, Thomas G P', 'Kobold, Sebastian', 'Busch, Dirk H', 'Jeremias, Irmela', 'Blaeschke, Franziska', 'Feuchtinger, Tobias']","['Stenger D', 'Stief TA', 'Kaeuferle T', 'Willier S', 'Rataj F', 'Schober K', 'Vick B', 'Lotfi R', 'Wagner B', 'Grunewald TGP', 'Kobold S', 'Busch DH', 'Jeremias I', 'Blaeschke F', 'Feuchtinger T']","[""Department of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology, Hemostaseology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Dr. von Hauner Children's Hospital, University Hospital, Ludwig Maximilians University Munich, Munich, Germany."", 'German Cancer Consortium, partner site, Munich, Germany.', ""Department of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology, Hemostaseology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Dr. von Hauner Children's Hospital, University Hospital, Ludwig Maximilians University Munich, Munich, Germany."", 'National Center for Infection Research, Munich, Germany.', ""Department of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology, Hemostaseology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Dr. von Hauner Children's Hospital, University Hospital, Ludwig Maximilians University Munich, Munich, Germany."", ""Department of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology, Hemostaseology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Dr. von Hauner Children's Hospital, University Hospital, Ludwig Maximilians University Munich, Munich, Germany."", 'Center for Integrated Protein Science Munich and Division of Clinical Pharmacology, Department of Medicine IV, Klinikum der Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany.', 'National Center for Infection Research, Munich, Germany.', 'Institute for Medical Microbiology, Immunology and Hygiene, Technische Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany.', ""Department of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology, Hemostaseology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Dr. von Hauner Children's Hospital, University Hospital, Ludwig Maximilians University Munich, Munich, Germany."", 'German Cancer Consortium, partner site, Munich, Germany.', 'Research Unit Apoptosis in Hematopoietic Stem Cells, Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, German Research Center for Environmental Health, Munich, Germany.', 'Institute for Transfusion Medicine, University Hospital Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'German Red Cross Blood Services Baden-Wurttemberg-Hessen, Institute for Clinical Transfusion Medicine and Immunogenetics Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department for Transfusion Medicine, Cell Therapeutics and Hemostaseology, Klinikum der Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium, partner site, Munich, Germany.', 'Max-Eder Research Group for Pediatric Sarcoma Biology, Institute of Pathology, Ludwig Maximilians University Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany;

However, the heterogeneity of clinical data raises new methodological challenges in feature selection, choosing a distance metric that captures biological meaning, and visualization. We hypothesized that clustering could discover prognostic groups from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, a disease that provides biological validation through well-understood outcomes. METHODS: To address this challenge, we applied k-medoids clustering with 10 distance metrics to 2 experiments (""A"" and ""B"") with mixed clinical features collapsed to binary vectors and visualized with both multidimensional scaling and t-stochastic neighbor embedding. To assess prognostic utility, we performed survival analysis using a Cox proportional hazard model, log-rank test, and Kaplan-Meier curves. RESULTS: In both experiments, survival analysis revealed a statistically significant association between clusters and survival outcomes (A: overall survival, P = .0164; B: time from diagnosis to treatment, P = .0039). Multidimensional scaling separated clusters along a gradient mirroring the order of overall survival. Longer survival was associated with mutated immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable region gene (IGHV) status, absent Zap 70 expression, female sex, and younger age. CONCLUSIONS: This approach to mixed-type data handling and selection of distance metric captured well-understood, binary, prognostic markers in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (sex, IGHV mutation status, ZAP70 expression status) with high fidelity.","['Coombes, Caitlin E', 'Abrams, Zachary B', 'Li, Suli', 'Abruzzo, Lynne V', 'Coombes, Kevin R']","['Coombes CE', 'Abrams ZB', 'Li S', 'Abruzzo LV', 'Coombes KR']","['The Ohio State University College of Medicine, Columbus, Ohio, USA.', 'Department of Biomedical Informatics, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA.', 'Department of Biomedical Informatics, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA.', 'Department of Statistics and Data Science, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA.', 'Department of Biomedical Informatics, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA.']",['eng'],['R03 CA235101/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,J Am Med Inform Assoc,Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,9430800,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP70 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/immunology/metabolism/*mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', '*Unsupervised Machine Learning', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase/*metabolism']",PMC7647286,['NOTNLM'],"['*chronic lymphocytic leukemia', '*clinical informatics, mixed-type data', '*clustering', '*unsupervised machine learning']",2020/06/03 06:00,2021/04/07 06:00,['2020/06/03 06:00'],"['2020/01/25 00:00 [received]', '2020/04/08 00:00 [revised]', '2020/04/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/07 06:00 [medline]', '2020/06/03 06:00 [entrez]']","['5850088 [pii]', '10.1093/jamia/ocaa060 [doi]']",ppublish,J Am Med Inform Assoc. 2020 Jul 1;27(7):1019-1027. doi: 10.1093/jamia/ocaa060.,,,"['(c) The Author(s) 2020.

However, the mechanism of action still remains unclear. Therefore, this study explored the effects of 6-gingerol on anti-leukemic mechanisms in NB4, MOLT4, and Raji leukemic cell. Results indicated that 6-gingerol inhibited cell proliferation and induced cell apoptosis in these 3 cell lines. Moreover, 6-gingerol was shown to increase the mRNA expression of the caspase family thereby suggesting that 6-gingerol induced apoptosis through the caspase-dependent pathway. To explore the signaling pathway regulating 6-gingerol induced apoptosis, we utilized and integrated the network pharmacology approach together with experimental investigations. Targets of 6-gingerol were identified from ChEMBL and STITCH databases, which were used for constructing the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. Results from the PPI network indicated that p53 was a key regulator. Moreover, it was found that 6-gingerol could increase the levels of p53 mRNA in all leukemic cell lines. Thus, 6-gingerol has shown to have anti-cancer activity. In addition, p53, BAX and BCL2 could be involved in the apoptosis pathway of these leukemic cells. This study is anticipated to be useful for the development of 6-gingerol as an anti-leukemic drug in the future.","['Chatupheeraphat, Chawalit', 'Nantasenamat, Chanin', 'Deesrisak, Kamolchanok', 'Roytrakul, Sittiruk', 'Anurathapan, Usanarat', 'Tanyong, Dalina']","['Chatupheeraphat C', 'Nantasenamat C', 'Deesrisak K', 'Roytrakul S', 'Anurathapan U', 'Tanyong D']","['Department of Clinical Microscopy, Faculty of Medical Technology, Mahidol University, Nakhon Pathom 73170, Thailand.', 'Center of Data Mining and Biomedical Informatics, Faculty of Medical Technology, Mahidol University, Bangkok 10700, Thailand.', 'Department of Clinical Microscopy, Faculty of Medical Technology, Mahidol University, Nakhon Pathom 73170, Thailand.', 'Proteomics Research Laboratory, National Center for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, 113 Thailand Science Park, Klongluang, Pathumthani 12120, Thailand.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Ramathibodi Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok 10400, Thailand.', 'Department of Clinical Microscopy, Faculty of Medical Technology, Mahidol University, Nakhon Pathom 73170, Thailand.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200506,Germany,EXCLI J,EXCLI journal,101299402,,,,PMC7257249,['NOTNLM'],"['6-gingerol', 'apoptosis', 'bioinformatics', 'leukemia', 'network pharmacology', 'p53']",2020/06/03 06:00,2020/06/03 06:01,['2020/06/03 06:00'],"['2019/11/26 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/06/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/03 06:01 [medline]']","['10.17179/excli2019-2008 [doi]', '2019-2008 [pii]', 'Doc582 [pii]']",epublish,EXCLI J. 2020 May 6;19:582-595. doi: 10.17179/excli2019-2008. eCollection 2020.,,,['Copyright (c) 2020 Chatupheeraphat et al.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nine H3K4me enzymes are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders to date, indicating their important roles in the brain. However, interplay among H3K4me enzymes during brain development remains largely unknown. Here, we show functional interactions of a writer-eraser duo, KMT2A and KDM5C, which are responsible for Wiedemann-Steiner Syndrome (WDSTS), and mental retardation X-linked syndromic Claes-Jensen type (MRXSCJ), respectively. Despite opposite enzymatic activities, the two mouse models deficient for either Kmt2a or Kdm5c shared reduced dendritic spines and increased aggression. Double mutation of Kmt2a and Kdm5c clearly reversed dendritic morphology, key behavioral traits including aggression, and partially corrected altered transcriptomes and H3K4me landscapes. Thus, our study uncovers common yet mutually suppressive aspects of the WDSTS and MRXSCJ models and provides a proof of principle for balancing a single writer-eraser pair to ameliorate their associated disorders.","['Vallianatos, Christina N', 'Raines, Brynne', 'Porter, Robert S', 'Bonefas, Katherine M', 'Wu, Michael C', 'Garay, Patricia M', 'Collette, Katie M', 'Seo, Young Ah', 'Dou, Yali', 'Keegan, Catherine E', 'Tronson, Natalie C', 'Iwase, Shigeki']","['Vallianatos CN', 'Raines B', 'Porter RS', 'Bonefas KM', 'Wu MC', 'Garay PM', 'Collette KM', 'Seo YA', 'Dou Y', 'Keegan CE', 'Tronson NC', 'Iwase S']","['Department of Human Genetics, Michigan Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, USA.', 'Genetics and Genomics Graduate Program, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, USA.', 'Department of Psychology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, USA.', 'Department of Human Genetics, Michigan Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, USA.', 'Genetics and Genomics Graduate Program, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, USA.', 'Department of Human Genetics, Michigan Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, USA.', 'The University of Michigan Neuroscience Graduate Program, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.', 'Neurodigitech, LLC, San Diego, CA, 92126, USA.', 'Department of Human Genetics, Michigan Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, USA.', 'The University of Michigan Neuroscience Graduate Program, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.', 'Department of Psychology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, USA.', 'Department of Nutritional Sciences, School of Public Health, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Michigan Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, USA.', 'Department of Human Genetics, Michigan Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Michigan Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, USA.', 'Department of Psychology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, USA. ntronson@umich.edu.', 'Department of Human Genetics, Michigan Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, USA. siwase@umich.edu.']",['eng'],"['UL1 TR000433/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 NS116008/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 NS089896/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'R21NS104774/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM007863/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'F31 NS103377/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 TR002240/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM007544/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 HD079342/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 NS104774/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200601,England,Commun Biol,Communications biology,101719179,"['0 (Histones)', '0 (histone H3 trimethyl Lys4)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 1.14.11.- (Histone Demethylases)', 'EC 1.14.11.- (Kdm5c protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Kmt2a protein, mouse)', 'Mental Retardation, X-Linked, Syndromic, Jarid1c-Related', 'Wiedemann Grosse Dibbern syndrome']",IM,"['Abnormalities, Multiple/*genetics', '*Aggression', 'Animals', 'Craniofacial Abnormalities/*genetics', 'Dendritic Spines/*metabolism', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Growth Disorders/*genetics', 'Histone Demethylases/deficiency/*genetics', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/deficiency/*genetics', 'Histones/*metabolism', 'Hypertrichosis/*genetics', 'Intellectual Disability/*genetics', 'Male', 'Mental Retardation, X-Linked/*genetics', 'Methylation', 'Mice', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/deficiency/*genetics']",PMC7264178,,,2020/06/03 06:00,2021/06/16 06:00,['2020/06/03 06:00'],"['2020/04/21 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/06/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/16 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s42003-020-1001-6 [doi]', '10.1038/s42003-020-1001-6 [pii]']",epublish,Commun Biol. 2020 Jun 1;3(1):278. doi: 10.1038/s42003-020-1001-6.,"['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3159-3200', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0877-8266', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1627-4877', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3829-8039', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1659-8126', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7780-6542', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5676-1579', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2280-7422']",,,['Commun Biol. 2020 Jun 22;3(1):331.

However, the immunosuppressive nature of the tumor microenvironment potentially poses a significant hurdle to T cell therapies. In hematological malignancies, the bone marrow (BM) niche is protective to leukemic stem cells and has minimized the efficacy of several anti-cancer drugs. In this study, we investigated the impact of the BM microenvironment on T cell redirection. Using bispecific antibodies targeting specific tumor antigens (CD123 and BCMA) and CD3, we observed that co-culture of acute myeloid leukemia or multiple myeloma cells with BM stromal cells protected tumor cells from bispecific antibody-T cell-mediated lysis in vitro and in vivo. Impaired CD3 redirection cytotoxicity was correlated with reduced T cell effector responses and cell-cell contact with stromal cells was implicated in reducing T cell activation and conferring protection of cancer cells. Finally, blocking the VLA4 adhesion pathway in combination with CD3 redirection reduced the stromal-mediated inhibition of cytotoxicity and T cell activation. Our results lend support to inhibiting VLA4 interactions along with administering CD3 redirection therapeutics as a novel combinatorial regimen for robust anti-cancer responses.","['Nair-Gupta, Priyanka', 'Rudnick, Stephen I', 'Luistro, Leopoldo', 'Smith, Melissa', 'McDaid, Ronan', 'Li, Yingzhe', 'Pillarisetti, Kodandaram', 'Joseph, Jocelin', 'Heidrich, Bradley', 'Packman, Kathryn', 'Attar, Ricardo', 'Gaudet, Francois']","['Nair-Gupta P', 'Rudnick SI', 'Luistro L', 'Smith M', 'McDaid R', 'Li Y', 'Pillarisetti K', 'Joseph J', 'Heidrich B', 'Packman K', 'Attar R', 'Gaudet F']","['Janssen Research & Development LLC, Spring House, PA, USA.', 'Janssen Research & Development LLC, Spring House, PA, USA.', 'Janssen Research & Development LLC, Spring House, PA, USA.', 'Janssen Research & Development LLC, Spring House, PA, USA.', 'Janssen Research & Development LLC, Spring House, PA, USA.', 'Janssen Research & Development LLC, Spring House, PA, USA.', 'Janssen Research & Development LLC, Spring House, PA, USA.', 'Janssen Research & Development LLC, Spring House, PA, USA.', 'Janssen Research & Development LLC, Spring House, PA, USA.', 'Janssen Research & Development LLC, Spring House, PA, USA.', 'Janssen Research & Development LLC, Spring House, PA, USA.', 'Janssen Research & Development LLC, Spring House, PA, USA. fgaudet@its.jnj.com.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200601,United States,Blood Cancer J,Blood cancer journal,101568469,"['0 (Antibodies, Bispecific)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological)', '0 (B-Cell Maturation Antigen)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (IL3RA protein, human)', '0 (Integrin alpha4beta1)', '0 (Interleukin-3 Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (TNFRSF17 protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Bispecific/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'B-Cell Maturation Antigen/antagonists & inhibitors/immunology', 'Bone Marrow/*drug effects/immunology/pathology', 'CD3 Complex/antagonists & inhibitors/*immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Integrin alpha4beta1/*antagonists & inhibitors/immunology', 'Interleukin-3 Receptor alpha Subunit/antagonists & inhibitors/immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/immunology/pathology', 'Mice', 'Multiple Myeloma/*drug therapy/immunology/pathology', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/immunology/pathology', 'Tumor Microenvironment/drug effects']",PMC7264144,,,2020/06/03 06:00,2021/05/11 06:00,['2020/06/03 06:00'],"['2019/03/28 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/11 00:00 [revised]', '2020/06/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/06/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/11 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41408-020-0331-4 [doi]', '10.1038/s41408-020-0331-4 [pii]']",epublish,Blood Cancer J. 2020 Jun 1;10(6):65. doi: 10.1038/s41408-020-0331-4.,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6942-8019'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, CD20 expression is highly variable between different B-cell malignancies, patients with the same malignancy, and even between intraclonal subpopulations in an individual patient. Several epigenetic (EZH2, HDAC1/2, HDAC1/4, HDAC6, complex Sin3A-HDAC1) and transcription factors (USF, OCT1/2, PU.1, PiP, ELK1, ETS1, SP1, NFkappaB, FOXO1, CREM, SMAD2/3) regulating CD20 expression (encoded by MS4A1) have been characterized. CD20 is induced in the context of microenvironmental interactions by CXCR4/SDF1 (CXCL12) chemokine signaling and the molecular function of CD20 has been linked to the signaling propensity of B-cell receptor (BCR). CD20 has also been shown to interact with multiple other surface proteins on B cells (such as CD40, MHCII, CD53, CD81, CD82, and CBP). Current efforts to combine anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies with BCR signaling inhibitors targeting BTK or PI3K (ibrutinib, acalabrutinib, idelalisib, duvelisib) or BH3-mimetics (venetoclax) lead to the necessity to better understand both the mechanisms of regulation and the biological functions of CD20. This is underscored by the observation that CD20 is decreased in response to the ""BCR inhibitor"" ibrutinib which largely prevents its successful combination with rituximab. Several small molecules (such as histone deacetylase inhibitors, DNA methyl-transferase inhibitors, aurora kinase A/B inhibitors, farnesyltransferase inhibitors, FOXO1 inhibitors, and bryostatin-1) are being tested to upregulate cell-surface CD20 levels and increase the efficacy of anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies. Herein, we review the current understanding of CD20 function, and the mechanisms of its regulation in normal and malignant B cells, highlighting the therapeutic implications.","['Pavlasova, Gabriela', 'Mraz, Marek']","['Pavlasova G', 'Mraz M']","['Central European Institute of Technology, Masaryk University, Brno.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Brno and Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Central European Institute of Technology, Masaryk University, Brno marek.mraz@email.cz.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Brno and Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD20)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal', '*Antigens, CD20', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell', 'Pyrimidines', 'Rituximab']",PMC7271567,,,2020/06/03 06:00,2021/04/28 06:00,['2020/06/03 06:00'],"['2019/11/22 00:00 [received]', '2020/04/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/06/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/28 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2019.243543 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2019.243543 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2020 Jun;105(6):1494-1506. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2019.243543.,,,['Copyright(c) 2020 Ferrata Storti Foundation.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a retrospective analysis of the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results database for patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia, up to 20 years of age, diagnosed between 1976 and 2016 and actively followed. Patients were stratified based on their period of diagnosis (1976-1989, 1990-1999, 2000-2009, 2010-2016) to assess the temporal trends in overall survival and early mortality. RESULTS: A total of 553 patients with a median age of 15 years (range, 0-20 years) were included. The 5-year overall survival increased significantly over time (by 22.6% from 1976 to 1989; by 59.2% from 1990 to 1999; by 77.7% from 2000 to 2009; and by 88.9% from 2010 to 2016; P < .001). Early mortality showed an improvement over time in the most recent cohort (by 14% from 1976 to 1989; by 13.5% from1990 to 1999; by 13.3% 2000 to 2009; and by 7.2% from 2010 to 2016) after adjusting for other demographic characteristics in a logistic regression model. On multivariate analysis of overall survival, diagnosis in the earlier time periods was associated with higher mortality as compared with the 2010-2016 period. Age, sex, and race/ethnicity were not significant predictors of overall survival.

Experimental data has revealed that DNA repair deficiencies similar to those found in BRCA mutant solid tumors function in malignant hematopoietic cells to enhance cell survival and promote therapy resistance. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that inhibition of PARP with a variety of agents can dramatically enhance the efficacy of other therapeutic approaches including cytotoxic and epigenetic chemotherapy, small molecule inhibitors (IDH and FLT3 inhibitors) and antibody drug conjugates. This has led to early stage clinical trials of multiple PARP inhibitors (PARPi) for AML patients. Despite small patient numbers, evidence of modest clinical efficacy and tolerability in combinatorial regimens support the further development of PARP inhibition as a novel therapeutic strategy for AML, particularly in select molecular subsets (MLL rearranged, FLT3 and IDH1 mutant disease.","['Fritz, Claire', 'Portwood, Scott M', 'Przespolewski, Amanda', 'Wang, Eunice S']","['Fritz C', 'Portwood SM', 'Przespolewski A', 'Wang ES']","['Leukemia Service, Department of Medicine, Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center, Elm and Carlton Streets, Buffalo, NY 14263, USA; Case Western Reserve University, 10900 Euclid Ave, Cleveland, OH 44106, USA.', 'Leukemia Service, Department of Medicine, Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center, Elm and Carlton Streets, Buffalo, NY 14263, USA.', 'Leukemia Service, Department of Medicine, Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center, Elm and Carlton Streets, Buffalo, NY 14263, USA.', 'Leukemia Service, Department of Medicine, Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center, Elm and Carlton Streets, Buffalo, NY 14263, USA.

The benefit and cost of AT supplementation in adults is unclear. We aimed to characterize VTE incidence and risk factors following AT and determine the characteristics and costs of supplementation. Fifty-three adults received PEG and AT. VTE occurred in 21% (grade >/=3 8%). T cell ALL and patients receiving prednisone during induction were at highest risk. Repeat AT levels post supplementation were subtherapeutic forty-four percent of the time. A median of 18 days elapsed between PEG and two sequential therapeutic AT levels despite supplementation. Patients received a median of 2 AT doses per PEG dose at a median cost of $11,145. VTE remains common in adults despite AT supplementation. More aggressive AT supplementation may reduce VTE but warrant prospective evaluation given the significant cost.","['Freyer, Craig W', 'Carulli, Alison', 'Ganetsky, Alex', 'Hughes, Mitchell E', 'Krause, Tracy M', 'Timlin, Colleen', 'Frey, Noelle V', 'Gill, Saar I', 'Hexner, Elizabeth O', 'Loren, Alison W', 'Mangan, James K', 'Martin, Mary Ellen', 'McCurdy, Shannon R', 'Perl, Alexander E', 'Pratz, Keith', 'Porter, David L', 'Luger, Selina M']","['Freyer CW', 'Carulli A', 'Ganetsky A', 'Hughes ME', 'Krause TM', 'Timlin C', 'Frey NV', 'Gill SI', 'Hexner EO', 'Loren AW', 'Mangan JK', 'Martin ME', 'McCurdy SR', 'Perl AE', 'Pratz K', 'Porter DL', 'Luger SM']","['Department of Pharmacy, Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Hematology-Oncology Section, Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Hematology-Oncology Section, Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Hematology-Oncology Section, Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Hematology-Oncology Section, Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Hematology-Oncology Section, Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Hematology-Oncology Section, Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Hematology-Oncology Section, Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Hematology-Oncology Section, Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Hematology-Oncology Section, Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Hematology-Oncology Section, Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Hematology-Oncology Section, Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200601,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Antithrombins)', '3WJQ0SDW1A (Polyethylene Glycols)', '7D96IR0PPM (pegaspargase)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antithrombins/adverse effects', 'Asparaginase/adverse effects', 'Dietary Supplements', 'Humans', 'Polyethylene Glycols', 'Prospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', '*Venous Thromboembolism/drug therapy/epidemiology/etiology']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Pegaspargase', '*acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*antithrombin', '*asparaginase', '*venous thromboembolism']",2020/06/03 06:00,2021/04/28 06:00,['2020/06/03 06:00'],"['2020/06/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/28 06:00 [medline]', '2020/06/03 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10428194.2020.1765239 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2020 Sep;61(9):2200-2207. doi: 10.1080/10428194.2020.1765239.

This finding has resulted in the development of numerous drugs that target this pathway, including various inhibitors of the kinases BTK, PI3K, and SYK. Several of these drugs have been approved in recent years for clinical use, resulting in a profound change in the way these diseases are currently being treated. However, the response rates and durability of responses vary largely across the different disease entities, suggesting a different proportion of patients with an activated BCR pathway and different mechanisms of BCR pathway activation. Indeed, several antigen-dependent and antigen-independent mechanisms have recently been described and shown to result in the activation of distinct downstream signaling pathways. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of the mechanisms responsible for the activation of the BCR pathway in different B cell malignancies and to correlate these mechanisms with clinical responses to treatment with BCR inhibitors.","['Efremov, Dimitar G', 'Turkalj, Sven', 'Laurenti, Luca']","['Efremov DG', 'Turkalj S', 'Laurenti L']","['Molecular Hematology, International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, 34149 Trieste, Italy.', 'Molecular Hematology, International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, 34149 Trieste, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology, Fondazione Policlinico Universitario A Gemelli IRCCS, 00168 Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],['IG2016 Id.19236/Associazione Italiana per la Ricerca sul Cancro'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200528,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,,,PMC7352865,['NOTNLM'],"['B-cell receptor', 'BTK', 'PI3K', 'SYK', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'lymphoma']",2020/06/03 06:00,2020/06/03 06:01,['2020/06/03 06:00'],"['2020/05/04 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/22 00:00 [revised]', '2020/05/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/06/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/03 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers12061396 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers12061396 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2020 May 28;12(6). pii: cancers12061396. doi: 10.3390/cancers12061396.,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-9081-5462', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8327-1396']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

During industrial activities in the last 100 years, pollutants have been emitted in large amounts, some of which are toxic and carcinogenic. The current study aims to analyse time trends in cancer incidence in the oil shale industry-affected areas and compare them with overall cancer incidence rates and trends in Estonia. We analysed Estonian Cancer Registry data on selected cancer sites that have been previously indicated to have relationships with industrial activities like oil shale extraction. We included lung cancer, kidney cancer, urinary bladder cancer, leukaemia, breast cancer, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. A statistically significantly higher lung cancer age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR) was found during the study period (1992-2015) only in males in the oil shale areas as compared to males in Estonia overall: 133.6 and 95.5 per 100,000, respectively. However, there appeared to be a statistically significant (p < 0.05) decrease in the lung cancer ASIR in males in the oil shale areas (overall decrease 28.9%), whereas at the same time, there was a significant increase (p < 0.05) in non-oil shale areas (13.3%) and in Estonia overall (1.5%). Other cancer sites did not show higher ASIRs in the oil shale industrial areas compared to other areas in Estonia. Possible explanations could be improved environmental quality, socio-economic factors, and other morbidities.","['Idavain, Jane', 'Lang, Katrin', 'Tomasova, Jelena', 'Lang, Aavo', 'Orru, Hans']","['Idavain J', 'Lang K', 'Tomasova J', 'Lang A', 'Orru H']","['Institute of Family Medicine and Public Health, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tartu, Ravila 19, 50411 Tartu, Estonia.', 'Department of Health Statistics, National Institute for Health Development, Hiiu 42, 11619 Tallinn, Estonia.', 'Institute of Family Medicine and Public Health, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tartu, Ravila 19, 50411 Tartu, Estonia.', 'Estonian Health Board, Paldiski mnt 81, 10617 Tallinn, Estonia.', 'Institute of Biomedicine and Translational Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tartu, Ravila 19, 50411 Tartu, Estonia.', 'Institute of Family Medicine and Public Health, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tartu, Ravila 19, 50411 Tartu, Estonia.', 'Department of Public Health and Clinical Medicine, Umea University, SE-901 87 Umea, Sweden.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200528,Switzerland,Int J Environ Res Public Health,International journal of environmental research and public health,101238455,['0 (Minerals)'],IM,"['Estonia/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Minerals', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology', '*Oil and Gas Industry']",PMC7312168,['NOTNLM'],"['*air pollution', '*lung cancer', '*occupational health', '*oil shale']",2020/06/03 06:00,2020/11/06 06:00,['2020/06/03 06:00'],"['2020/04/01 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/15 00:00 [revised]', '2020/05/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/06/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/06 06:00 [medline]']","['ijerph17113833 [pii]', '10.3390/ijerph17113833 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Environ Res Public Health. 2020 May 28;17(11). pii: ijerph17113833. doi: 10.3390/ijerph17113833.,,['The authors declare no conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fourteen variants in the following candidate genes were genotyped using allele discrimination assay by real-time PCR: ABCB1, DHFR, GGH, FPGS, MTHFR, RFC1, SLCO1B1, TPMT, and NUDT15. Methotrexate polyglutamate (MTXPG3-5) levels in red blood cells were measured by LC-MS/MS. Early hematological TRT (grade 3-4) was seen in 54.9% of patients. The NUDT15*3 allele was associated with early TRT occurrence [HR: 3.04 (95% CI: 1.5-6.1); p = 0.007].

Specifically, we focus on the development of dual hybrids to exploit multitargeting of key epigenetic molecules deregulated in cancer; the study of epigenetic-synthetic lethality interactions as a mechanism to address loss-of-function mutations, and the combination of epidrugs with other therapies such as immunotherapy to avoid acquired chemoresistance and increase therapy sensitivity. By exploring these challenges, among others, the field of epigenetic chemical biology will increase its potential for clinical benefit, and more effective strategies targeting the aberrant epigenome in cancer are likely to be developed both in haematological and solid tumours.","['Cossio, Fernando P', 'Esteller, Manel', 'Berdasco, Maria']","['Cossio FP', 'Esteller M', 'Berdasco M']","['Kimika Fakultatea, Kimika Organikoa I Saila, Universidad del Pais Vasco - Euskal Herriko Unibertsitaea, and Donostia International Physics Center (DIPC), San Sebastian-Donostia, Spain; Centro de Innovacion en Quimica Avanzada (ORFEO-CINQA), Spain.', 'Cancer Epigenetics Group, Cancer and Leukemia Epigenetics and Biology Program (PEBCL), Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute (IJC), Badalona, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain; Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red Cancer (CIBERONC), Madrid, Spain; Institucio Catalana de Recerca i Estudis Avancats (ICREA), Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain; Physiological Sciences Department, School of Medicine and Health Sciences, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain.', 'Bellvitge Biomedical Research Institute (IDIBELL), Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain; Epigenetic Therapies Group, Experimental and Clinical Hematology Program (PHEC), Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute (IJC), Badalona, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain.

Identification of the factors that influence Treg cell function is extremely important. Our current study aimed to evaluate the frequency of Treg cells, cytokine secretion and the expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients. The frequency of CD3(+), CD4(+) and CD4(+)CD25(+)FOXP3(+) Treg was assessed by flow cytometry in 43 ALL patients versus 42 controls. Plasma levels of IL-10, transcription factor beta (TGF-beta), IL-6, IL-17, IL-23 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha) were measured by Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). miR-21, miR-24, miR-26a, miR133b, miR-148a and miR-155 expression were analyzed using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). A slight insignificant increase in Treg cells in ALL patients compared to controls was observed. There was a significant elevation in IL-10 (p < 0.05), IL-6 (p < 0.01), IL-23 (p < 0.05) and TNF-alpha (p < 0.01) in ALL patients compared with controls. Meanwhile, a significant reduction in TGF-beta (p < 0.001) was recorded. A slight insignificant decrease in IL-17 in ALL patients was observed.ALL patients showed a significant increase in miR-21 (p < 0.05), miR-148a (p < 0.01), miR-24 (p < 0.05) and a significant reduction in miR-155 (p < 0.01). In conclusion, the slight change in Treg cells frequency and alteration in related cytokines could possibly involve in the pathogenesis of ALL. Dysregulated miRNAs, as a regulatory mechanism of epigenetics, might contribute to these observed results. Further researches are required to confirm our interesting findings.","['El-Maadawy, Eman A', 'Elshal, Mohamed F', 'Bakry, Rania M', 'Moussa, Mohamed M', 'El-Naby, SobhyHasab', 'Talaat, Roba M']","['El-Maadawy EA', 'Elshal MF', 'Bakry RM', 'Moussa MM', 'El-Naby S', 'Talaat RM']","['Molecular Biology Department, Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology Research Institute (GEBRI), University of Sadat City, Sadat, Egypt.

These neoplasms are uncommon and usually diagnostically challenging. The focus of this article is to suggest an immunohistochemistry-based, practical approach to assist in the diagnosis of nodal T-cell lymphomas. These neoplasms fall into two major groups: those with many CD30+ tumor cells (group A) and neoplasms that are negative or show only partial expression of CD30 (group B). The differential diagnosis of group A neoplasms mainly includes ALK+ anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (ALCL), ALK-negative ALCL, mycosis fungoides with CD30+ large-cell transformation, adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma, extranodal T-cell lymphomas involving lymph nodes (usually regional), and peripheral T-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified (PTCL-NOS). Group B neoplasms also include two groups based on the presence or absence of T follicular helper (TFH) markers. Those neoplasms expressing at least 2 TFH markers include angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma, nodal PTCL with a TFH phenotype, and follicular T-cell lymphoma. Neoplasms expressing </=1 TFH marker can be further subdivided based on the expression of CD8 and cytotoxic markers and mainly include PTCL-NOS and a series of unusual subsets including primary Epstein-Barr virus-positive nodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma, PTCL-NOS with a cytotoxic immunophenotype, and gamma/delta T-cell lymphomas. Using this algorithmic approach, we suggest that the pathologist can establish a diagnosis for most nodal T-cell lymphomas encountered in daily practice.","['Vega, Francisco', 'Medeiros, L Jeffrey']","['Vega F', 'Medeiros LJ']","['Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.

With the discovery of different RNA species, the mechanism of RNA-RNA interaction has caught more and more attention. ""Competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) hypothesis"" is one of the fascinating products of recent researches. CeRNAs are endogenous RNA transcripts that share mutual microRNA response elements (MREs) and regulate expression of each other by competing for the same microRNAs pools. The hypothesis links different RNA species together and enriches our understanding of the human genome.

Although loss-of-function of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) is a common event in pediatric T-ALLs, the exact role of this tumor suppressor in T-ALL development has yet to be defined. METHODS: Here, we report an optimized cytometric method for accurate proteomic profiling of T-ALL leukemic blasts at single-cell level. We determined the expression of PI3K and JAK-STAT signaling components in both primary and immortalized T-ALL cells as well as in normal T cells. RESULTS: We observed that PTEN exon 7 mutated T-ALL cells retain a distinct PI3K activation; in particular, these cells show higher pAkt levels and a lower pS6 expression. Interestingly, we demonstrated for the first time that PTEN exon 7 mutated T-ALL are nonresponsive to IL7 in vitro as assessed by lack of pSTAT5 activation, although they do express IL7R. CONCLUSIONS: Phosphoflow analysis represents a fast, reliable, and accurate method to study the signaling profile of T-ALL. PTEN exon 7 mutated T-ALL cells are nonresponsive to IL7 in vitro suggesting that they may activate other mechanisms to support their viability and proliferation such as a higher constitutive PI3K/Akt signaling. Further investigations are necessary to elucidate the significance of this peculiar signaling behavior. Our observations should be taken into account in future studies aiming at molecular targeting of PI3K and/or JAK/STAT pathways for pharmacological intervention in T-ALL.","['Bonaccorso, Paola', 'Bugarin, Cristina', 'Buracchi, Chiara', 'Fazio, Grazia', 'Biondi, Andrea', 'Lo Nigro, Luca', 'Gaipa, Giuseppe']","['Bonaccorso P', 'Bugarin C', 'Buracchi C', 'Fazio G', 'Biondi A', 'Lo Nigro L', 'Gaipa G']","['M.

Here we examine front-line treatments and quality of life (QoL) in patients with newly diagnosed mycosis fungoides (MF). OBJECTIVES: To identify (i) differences in first-line approaches according to tumour-nodes-metastasis-blood (TNMB) staging; (ii) parameters related to a first-line systemic approach and (iii) response rates and QoL measures. METHODS: In total, 395 newly diagnosed patients with early-stage MF (stage IA-IIA) were recruited from 41 centres in 17 countries between 1 January 2015 and 31 December 2018 following central clinicopathological review. RESULTS: The most common first-line therapy was skin-directed therapy (SDT) (322 cases, 81.5%), while a smaller percentage (44 cases, 11.1%) received systemic therapy. Expectant observation was used in 7.3%. In univariate analysis, the use of systemic therapy was significantly associated with higher clinical stage (IA, 6%; IB, 14%; IIA, 20%; IA-IB vs. IIA, P < 0.001), presence of plaques (T1a/T2a, 5%; T1b/T2b, 17%; P < 0.001), higher modified Severity Weighted Assessment Tool (> 10, 15%; </= 10, 7%; P = 0.01) and folliculotropic MF (FMF) (24% vs. 12%, P = 0.001). Multivariate analysis demonstrated significant associations with the presence of plaques (T1b/T2b vs. T1a/T2a, odds ratio 3.07) and FMF (odds ratio 2.83). The overall response rate (ORR) to first-line SDT was 73%, while the ORR to first-line systemic treatments was lower (57%) (P = 0.027). Health-related QoL improved significantly both in patients with responsive disease and in those with stable disease. CONCLUSIONS: Disease characteristics such as presence of plaques and FMF influence physician treatment choices, and SDT was superior to systemic therapy even in patients with such disease characteristics. Consequently, future treatment guidelines for early-stage MF need to address these issues.","['Quaglino, P', 'Prince, H M', 'Cowan, R', 'Vermeer, M', 'Papadavid, E', 'Bagot, M', 'Servitjie, O',

There are limited therapeutic options available for patients, including hypomethylating agents (azacitidine/decitabine), growth factor support, lenalidomide, and allogeneic stem cell transplant. AREAS COVERED: This review provides an overview of the progress made over the past decade for emerging therapies for lower- and higher-risk MDS (MDS-HR). We also cover advances in prognostication, supportive care, and use of allogeneic SCT in MDS. EXPERT OPINION: While there have been no FDA-approved therapies for MDS in the past decade, we anticipate the approval of luspatercept based on results from the MEDALIST trial for patients with lower-risk MDS (MDS-LR) and ringed sideroblasts who have failed or are ineligible for erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs). With growing knowledge of the biologic and molecular mechanisms underlying MDS, it is anticipated that new therapies will be approved in the coming years.","['Feld, Jonathan', 'Belasen, Abigail', 'Navada, Shyamala C']","['Feld J', 'Belasen A', 'Navada SC']","['Tisch Cancer Institute, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Icahn School of Medicine , New York, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine , New York, USA.', 'Tisch Cancer Institute, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Icahn School of Medicine , New York, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20200601,England,Expert Rev Anticancer Ther,Expert review of anticancer therapy,101123358,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Disease Progression', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/etiology/pathology', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/pathology/*therapy', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Myelodysplastic syndromes', '*erythropoiesis stimulating agents', '*hypomethylating agents', '*lenalidomide', '*targeted therapies']",2020/06/02 06:00,2021/04/07 06:00,['2020/06/02 06:00'],"['2020/06/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/07 06:00 [medline]', '2020/06/02 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/14737140.2020.1770088 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Rev Anticancer Ther. 2020 Jun;20(6):465-482. doi: 10.1080/14737140.2020.1770088.

To resolve this issue, p53+/+ and p53-/- ESCs derived by two different methods were used to quantify time-dependent changes in nuclear DNA content; annexin-V binding; cell permeabilization; and protein expression, modification, and localization. The results revealed that doxorubicin (Adriamycin [ADR]) concentrations 10 to 40 times less than commonly used in previous studies induced the DNA damage-dependent G2-checkpoint and completed apoptosis within the same time frame, regardless of the presence or absence of p53, p21, and PUMA. Increased ADR concentrations delayed initiation of apoptosis in p53-/- ESCs, but the rates of apoptosis remained equivalent. Similar results were obtained by inducing apoptosis with either staurosporine inhibition of kinase activities or WX8 disruption of lysosome homeostasis. Differentiation of ESCs by LIF deprivation revealed p53-dependent formation of haploid cells, increased genomic stability, and suppression of the G2-checkpoint. Minimal induction of DNA damage now resulted in p53-facilitated apoptosis, but regulation of pluripotent gene expression remained p53-independent. Primary embryonic fibroblasts underwent p53-dependent total cell cycle arrest (a prelude to cell senescence), and p53-independent apoptosis occurred in the presence of 10-fold higher levels of ADR, consistent with previous studies. Taken together, these results reveal that the multiple roles of p53 in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis are first acquired during pluripotent stem cell differentiation.","['Jaiswal, Sushil K', 'Oh, John J', 'DePamphilis, Melvin L']","['Jaiswal SK', 'Oh JJ', 'DePamphilis ML']","['National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.']",['eng'],"['ZIA HD000506/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States', 'ZIA HD000507/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",20200601,United States,Stem Cells,"Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)",9304532,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (PUMA protein, mouse)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/metabolism', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Count', '*Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', '*Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Membrane Permeability/drug effects', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/metabolism', 'DNA Damage', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/*cytology/drug effects/*metabolism', 'G2 Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Haploidy', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/metabolism']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Adriamycin', '*WX8', '*differentiation', '*doxorubicin', '*haploid', '*pluripotency', '*staurosporine']",2020/06/02 06:00,2021/07/02 06:00,['2020/06/02 06:00'],"['2020/01/17 00:00 [received]', '2020/04/11 00:00 [revised]', '2020/04/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/02 06:00 [medline]', '2020/06/02 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/stem.3199 [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cells. 2020 Sep;38(9):1091-1106. doi: 10.1002/stem.3199.

This large case-control study aimed to assess the associations between HBV infection status and multiple cancers. Cases (n = 50 392) and controls (n = 11 361) were consecutively recruited from 2008 to 2016 at the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University. Multivariable adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were estimated using logistic regression by adjusting age and gender. A meta-analysis based on published studies was also performed to verify the associations. Of these, 12.1% of cases and 5.5% of controls were hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) seropositive. We observed significant associations between HBsAg seropositivity and esophagus cancer (aOR [95% CI] = 1.32 [1.13-1.54]), stomach cancer (1.46 [1.30-1.65]), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC; 39.11 [35.08-43.59]), intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile duct carcinoma (ICC and ECC; 3.83 [2.58-5.67] and 1.72 [1.28-2.31]), pancreatic cancer (PaC; 1.37 [1.13-1.65]), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL; 1.88 [1.61-2.20]) and leukemia (11.48 [4.05-32.56]). Additionally, compared to participants with HBsAg-/anti-HBs-/anti-HBc-, participants with HBsAg-/anti-HBs-/anti-HBc+, indicating past HBV-infected, had an increased risk of esophagus cancer (aOR [95% CI] = 1.46 [1.24-1.73]), stomach cancer (1.20 [1.04-1.39]), HCC (4.80 [3.95-5.84]) and leukemia (15.62 [2.05-119.17]). Then the overall meta-analysis also verified that HBsAg seropositivity was significantly associated with stomach cancer (OR [95% CI] = 1.23 [1.14-1.33]), ICC (4.05 [2.78-5.90]), ECC (1.73 [1.30-2.30]), PaC (1.26 [1.09-1.46]), NHL (1.95 [1.55-2.44]) and leukemia (1.54 [1.26-1.88]). In conclusion, both our case-control study and meta-analysis confirmed the significant association of HBsAg seropositivity with stomach cancer, ICC, ECC, PaC, NHL and leukemia. Of note, our findings also suggested that the risk of stomach cancer elevated for people whoever exposed to HBV.","['Tian, Ting', 'Song, Ci', 'Jiang, Longfeng', 'Dai, Jingjing', 'Lin, Yuan', 'Xu,

Over the last few decades, the field of antibody-drug conjugates, bispecific antibodies, chimeric antigen receptors (CAR) and cancer immunotherapy has emerged as the most promising area of basic and therapeutic investigations. With numerous successful human trials targeting immune checkpoint receptors and CAR-T cells in leukemia and melanoma at a breakthrough pace, it is highly exciting times for oncologic therapeutics derived from variations of antibody engineering. Regrettably, a significantly large numbers of antibody and CAR based therapeutics have also proven disappointing in human trials of solid cancers because of the limited availability of immune effector cells in the tumor bed. Importantly, nonspecific distribution of therapeutic antibodies in tissues other than tumors also contribute to the lack of clinical efficacy, associated toxicity and clinical failure. As faithful translation of preclinical studies into human clinical trails are highly relied on mice tumor xenograft efficacy and safety studies, here we highlight a method to test the tumor and general tissue distribution of therapeutic antibodies. This is achieved by labeling the protein-A purified antibody with near Infrared fluorescent dye followed by live imaging of tumor bearing mice.","['Shivange, Gururaj', 'Mondal, Tanmoy', 'Lyerly, Evan', 'Gatesman, Jeremy', 'Tushir-Singh, Jogender']","['Shivange G', 'Mondal T', 'Lyerly E', 'Gatesman J', 'Tushir-Singh J']","['Laboratory of Novel Biologics, University of Virginia School of Medicine; Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, UVA Cancer Center, University of Virginia School of Medicine.', 'Laboratory of Novel Biologics, University of Virginia School of Medicine; Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, UVA Cancer Center, University of Virginia School of Medicine.', 'Laboratory of Novel Biologics, University of Virginia School of Medicine; Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, UVA Cancer Center, University of Virginia School of Medicine.', 'Center for Comparative Medicine, University of Virginia.', 'Laboratory of Novel Biologics, University of Virginia School of Medicine; Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, UVA Cancer Center, University of Virginia School of Medicine; jogi@virginia.edu.']",['eng'],['R01 CA233752/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", 'Video-Audio Media']",20200516,United States,J Vis Exp,Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,101313252,"['0 (Antibodies, Bispecific)', '0 (Staphylococcal Protein A)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Bispecific/*therapeutic use', 'CHO Cells', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cricetulus', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms/*therapy', 'Staphylococcal Protein A', 'Tissue Distribution']",,,,2020/06/02 06:00,2020/10/21 06:00,['2020/06/02 06:00'],"['2020/06/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/06/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3791/60727 [doi]'],epublish,J Vis Exp. 2020 May 16;(159). doi: 10.3791/60727.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SUMMARY ANSWER: There were similar CLBRs between the GnRH antagonist, depot GnRHa and long GnRHa protocols. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: There is no consensus on which COS protocol is the most optimal in women with normal ovarian response. The CLBR provides the final success rate after one complete ART cycle, including the fresh and all subsequent frozen-thawed embryo transfer (ET) cycles. We suggest that the CLBR measure would allow for better comparisons between the different treatment protocols. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: A prospective controlled, randomized, open label trial was performed between May 2016 and May 2017. A total of 819 patients were allocated to the GnRH antagonist, depot GnRHa or long GnRHa protocol in a 1:1:1 ratio. The minimum follow-up time from the first IVF cycle was 2 years. To further investigate the potential effect of COS with the GnRH antagonist, depot GnRHa or long GnRHa protocol on endometrial receptivity, the expression of homeobox A10 (HOXA10), myeloid ecotropic viral integration site 1 (MEIS1) and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) endometrial receptivity markers was evaluated in endometrial tissue from patients treated with the different COS protocols. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Infertile women with normal ovarian response (n = 819) undergoing IVF/ICSI treatment were randomized to the GnRH antagonist, depot GnRHa or long GnRHa protocol. Both IVF and ICSI cycles were included, and the sperm samples used were either fresh or frozen partner ejaculates or frozen donor ejaculates. The primary outcome was the live birth rate (LBR) per fresh ET cycle, and the CLBR after one complete ART cycle, until the birth of a first child (after 28 weeks) or until all frozen embryos were used, whichever occurred first. Pipelle endometrial biopsies from 34 female patients were obtained on Days 7-8 after oocyte retrieval or spontaneous ovulation in natural cycles, respectively, and HOXA10, MEIS1 and LIF mRNA and protein expression levels in the human endometrium was determined by quantitative real-time PCR and western blot, respectively. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: There were no significant differences in CLBRs between the GnRH antagonist, depot GnRHa or long GnRHa protocol (71.4 versus 75.5 versus 72.2%, respectively). However, there was a significantly higher LBR per fresh ET cycle in the depot GnRHa protocol than in the long GnRHa and GnRH antagonist protocols (62.6 versus 52.1% versus 45.6%, P < 0.05). Furthermore, HOXA10, MEIS1 and LIF mRNA and protein expression in endometrium all showed significantly higher in the depot GnRHa protocol than in the long GnRHa and GnRH antagonist protocols (P < 0.05). LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: A limitation of our study was that both our clinicians and patients were not blinded to the randomization for the randomized controlled trial (RCT). An inclusion criterion for the current retrospective cohort study was based on the 'actual ovarian response' during COS treatment, while the included population for the RCT was 'expected normal responders' based on maternal age and ovarian reserve test. In addition, the analysis was restricted to patients under 40 years of age undergoing their first IVF cycle. Furthermore, the endometrial tissue was collected from patients who cancelled the fresh ET, which may include some patients at risk for ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, however only patients with 4-19 oocytes retrieved were included in the molecular study. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: The depot GnRH agonist protocol improves the live birth rate per fresh ET cycle, but not the cumulative live birth rate in normal responders. A possible explanation for the improved LBR after fresh ET in the depot GnRHa protocol could be molecular signalling at the level of endometrial receptivity.

The results of increased venous pressure in the upper body may cause edema of the head and neck associated with cyanosis, plethora and distended subcutaneous vessels. Vena cava superior syndrome is rare in childhood. Therefore, we planned this retrospective study. METHODS: The retrospective study was carried out on the children with mediastinal tumors in the Department of Pediatric Hematology-oncology, Erciyes University Faculty of Medicine, Kayseri, Turkey , from January 2010 to December 2017. Diagnostic procedures included hematological investigations, chestradiography, thoracic computed tomography, echocardiography and lymph node or mediastinal biopsy. RESULTS: In this study, 19 (five were female) of 41 patients with mediastinal tumors had Vena cava superior syndrome. Diagnosis included Hodgkin's lymphoma in seven (37%), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in six (32%), acute T- lymphoblastic leukemia in four (21%), neuroblastoma and anaplastic round cell sarcoma in one each respectively. All of the 19 patients' facial swelling, venous distention and mediastinal widening. All patients received intravenous corticosteroids (0.6 mg/kg dexamethasone). Furthermore, the patient with anaplastic round cell sarcoma received emergency radiotherapy. No patients died because of Vena cava superior syndrome. CONCLUSION: Vena cava superior syndrome is a medical emergency that requiresurgent treatment. Vena cava superior syndrome studies in children are rare. In this retrospective study, we found that the most common cause of Vena cava superior syndrome was Hodgkin's lymphoma different from literature.","['Ozcan, Alper', 'Unal, Ekrem', 'Karakukcu, Musa', 'Coskun, Abdulhakim', 'Ozdemir, Mehmet Akif', 'Patiroglu, Turkan']","['Ozcan A', 'Unal E', 'Karakukcu M', 'Coskun A', 'Ozdemir MA', 'Patiroglu T']","['Division of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Erciyes University Faculty of Medicine, Kayseri, Turkey.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Erciyes University Faculty of Medicine, Kayseri, Turkey.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Erciyes University Faculty of Medicine, Kayseri, Turkey.', 'Division of Pediatric Radiology, Department of Radiology, Erciyes University Faculty of Medicine, Kayseri, Turkey.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Erciyes University Faculty of Medicine, Kayseri, Turkey.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Erciyes University Faculty of Medicine, Kayseri, Turkey.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200409,Turkey,North Clin Istanb,Northern clinics of Istanbul,101684520,,,,PMC7251265,['NOTNLM'],"['Child', 'emergency treatment', 'mediastinal tumor', 'vena cava superior syndrome']",2020/06/02 06:00,2020/06/02 06:01,['2020/06/02 06:00'],"['2019/01/07 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/06/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/02 06:01 [medline]']","['10.14744/nci.2019.46354 [doi]', 'NCI-7-255 [pii]']",epublish,North Clin Istanb. 2020 Apr 9;7(3):255-259. doi: 10.14744/nci.2019.46354. eCollection 2020.,,['Conflict of Interest: No conflict of interest was declared by the authors.'],"['Copyright: (c) 2020 by Istanbul Northern Anatolian Association of Public', 'Hospitals.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: In this study, 225 patients who were diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and undergoing intensive treatment for remission induction were enrolled in a retrospective manner. RESULTS: Within the whole group, which consisted of 225 patients, 90 patients received prophylactic antifungal treatment (PAT) (40%), while 135 patients did not (60%) receive. The mean cost of hospitalization was 9.151,6 (2.872,6-20.483,3) US dollars. Gender distribution and mean ages of groups were similar. One hundred fourteen patients not on PAT (84.4%) and five patients on PAT (5.5%) received intravenous antifungal treatment. Thirty-two of the patients who were not on PAT (23.7%) and 11 of the patients on PAT died during remission induction (12.22%). The mean day of the hospitalization was 22.61 days for the patients on PAT and 33.89 days for the patients who were not on PAT. In patients on PAT, the mean number of transfused platelet units was six (0-9), while 12.51 (4-43) units for patients who were not on PAT.

Observations: We present the case of a 20-year-old patient, diagnosed with a high-risk phy-negative, pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), with a positive MLL gene rearrangement. After a Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster-like regimen chemotherapy protocol and a first complete remission, ALL relapse was diagnosed, so he was commenced on a FlaG-Ida protocol (fludarabine, idarubicin, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, and high-dose cytarabine). He achieved a second complete remission with positive minimal residual disease and was scheduled for urgent allogeneic bone marrow transplant.Five days before the conditioning regimen was initiated, the patient complained of visual loss in the left eye and then in the right eye. Ophthalmological evaluation showed a best corrected visual acuity of the right eye (OD) of 20/100 and of the left eye (OS) of 20/400. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) showed a bilateral serous sub-foveal detachment. The sub-foveal choroidal thickness was measured by enhanced depth imaging (EDI-OCT) and showed a significant increase (OD 836 mum and OS 1036 mum) compared with normal (average 310 mum). This choroidal thickness increase, associated with the serous macular detachment, was interpreted as a choroidal leukemic infiltration.A lumbar puncture with cytologic studies and flow cytometry was performed, showing no evidence of central nervous system (CNS) involvement of leukemia. CNS and orbital magnetic nuclear resonance imaging showed no pathology. No extramedullary involvement could be confirmed.Retinal fluorescein angiography showed multiple and diffuse leakage points (pinpoint pattern) within the macular area. This pattern reinforced our presumptive diagnosis, even though the lumbar puncture and flow cytometry were negative.The hematologist decided to proceed with the bone marrow transplant. A myeloablative conditioning regimen was delivered, based on total body irradiation (TBI) with a total dose of 12 Gy plus fludarabine 30 mg/m(2) for five days. No ocular protection was used during TBI.Only 2 h after TBI commenced, the patient reported a significant improvement in his visual acuity. We confirmed 20/20 in both eyes. The OCT showed a dramatic decrease in the choroidal thickness measurement (OD 387 mum and OS 408 mum compared with 836 mum and 1036 mum measured before radiotherapy). Conclusions and importance: Complete ophthalmological evaluation and EDI-OCT choroidal thickness measurement could be fundamental tools necessary to determine CNS involvement of ALL, even in cases with negative cerebrospinal fluid and brain imaging.","['Adaniya, Agustina', 'Bazterrechea, Pablo', 'Trucco, Jose Ignacio', 'Schlaen, Bernardo Ariel', 'Kusminsky, Gustavo', 'Saravia, Mario Joaquin']","['Adaniya A', 'Bazterrechea P', 'Trucco JI', 'Schlaen BA', 'Kusminsky G', 'Saravia MJ']","['Hospital Universitario Austral, Pilar, Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Hospital Universitario Austral, Pilar, Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Hospital Universitario Austral, Pilar, Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Hospital Universitario Austral, Pilar, Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Hospital Universitario Austral, Pilar, Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Buenos Aires Macula, Buenos Aires, Argentina.']",['eng'],,['Case Reports'],20200513,United States,Am J Ophthalmol Case Rep,American journal of ophthalmology case reports,101679941,,,,PMC7251383,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'Bilateral macular detachment', 'Choroid', 'Leukemic relapse', 'Sanctuary', 'Total body irradiation (TBI)']",2020/06/02 06:00,2020/06/02 06:01,['2020/06/02 06:00'],"['2020/02/09 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/06 00:00 [revised]', '2020/05/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/06/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/02 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1016/j.ajoc.2020.100746 [doi]', 'S2451-9936(20)30097-9 [pii]', '100746 [pii]']",epublish,Am J Ophthalmol Case Rep. 2020 May 13;19:100746. doi: 10.1016/j.ajoc.2020.100746. eCollection 2020 Sep.,,['No conflict of interest.'],['(c) 2020 Published by Elsevier Inc.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The heterogeneity and invasiveness of pediatric brain tumors have historically made them difficult to treat. Although surgical intervention and standard of care therapies such as radiation and chemotherapy have improved the outlook for those affected, results are often transient and lend themselves to tumor recurrence or resistance. There also still exists a subset of brain tumors which remain unresponsive to treatment altogether. Therefore, there is great need for new therapeutic approaches. With the recent advent of molecularly-driven technologies, many of these complex tumors can now be classified by integrating molecular profiling data with clinical information such as demographics and outcomes. This new knowledge has allowed for the molecular stratification of pediatric brain tumors into distinct subgroups and the identification of molecular targets, which is changing how these children are treated, namely in the setting of clinical trials. Notable examples include reduced doses of radiation and chemotherapy in the wingless-activated subgroup of medulloblastoma, which has a favorable prognosis, and novel experimental drugs targeting BRAF alterations in low-grade gliomas and dopamine receptors in high-grade gliomas. In this review, we highlight several key previous and ongoing clinical trials that utilize molecular stratifications and targets for the treatment of pediatric brain tumors.","['Hanz, Samuel Z', 'Adeuyan, Oluwaseyi', 'Lieberman, Grace', 'Hennika, Tammy']","['Hanz SZ', 'Adeuyan O', 'Lieberman G', 'Hennika T']","['Department of Neurological Surgery, Division of Child Neurology, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Neurological Surgery, Division of Child Neurology, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Division of Child Neurology, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Division of Child Neurology, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,China,Transl Pediatr,Translational pediatrics,101649179,,,,PMC7237976,['NOTNLM'],"['Brain tumor', 'clinical trials', 'molecular', 'pediatric']",2020/06/02 06:00,2020/06/02 06:01,['2020/06/02 06:00'],"['2020/06/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/06/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/02 06:01 [medline]']","['10.21037/tp.2020.03.04 [doi]', 'tp-09-02-144 [pii]']",ppublish,Transl Pediatr. 2020 Apr;9(2):144-156. doi: 10.21037/tp.2020.03.04.,,"['Conflicts of Interest: All authors have completed the ICMJE uniform disclosure', 'form (available at http://dx.doi.org/10.21037/tp.2020.03.04).

In the T-ALL context, LMO2 drives oncogenic progression through binding to erythroid-specific transcription factor SCL/TAL1 and sequestration of E-protein transcription factors, normally required for T-cell differentiation. A key requirement for the formation of this oncogenic protein-protein interaction (PPI) is the conformational flexibility of LMO2. Here we identify a small molecule inhibitor of the SCL-LMO2 PPI, which hinders the interaction in vitro through direct binding to LMO2. Biophysical analysis demonstrates that this inhibitor acts through a mechanism of conformational modulation of LMO2. Importantly, this work has led to the identification of a small molecule inhibitor of the SCL-LMO2 PPI, which can provide a starting point for the development of new agents for the treatment of T-ALL. These results suggest that similar approaches, based on the modulation of protein conformation by small molecules, might be used for therapeutic targeting of other oncogenic PPIs.","['Milton-Harris, Leanne', 'Jeeves, Mark', 'Walker, Sarah A', 'Ward, Simon E', 'Mancini, Erika J']","['Milton-Harris L', 'Jeeves M', 'Walker SA', 'Ward SE', 'Mancini EJ']","['School of Life Sciences, Biochemistry Department, University of Sussex, Falmer, Brighton, BN1 9QG, United Kingdom.', 'Institute of Cancer and Genomic Sciences, College of Medical and Dental Sciences, University of Birmingham, Edgbaston, Birmingham, B15 2TT, United Kingdom.', 'Sussex Drug Discovery Centre, University of Sussex, Brighton, BN1 9QJ, United Kingdom.', 'Medicines Discovery Institute, Cardiff University, Park Place, Cardiff, CF10 3AT, United Kingdom.', 'School of Life Sciences, Biochemistry Department, University of Sussex, Falmer, Brighton, BN1 9QG, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200512,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,,,,PMC7233811,['NOTNLM'],"['LMO2', 'T-ALL', 'drug discovery', 'leukaemia', 'protein-protein interaction']",2020/06/02 06:00,2020/06/02 06:01,['2020/06/02 06:00'],"['2019/12/24 00:00 [received]', '2020/04/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/06/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/02 06:01 [medline]']","['10.18632/oncotarget.27580 [doi]', '27580 [pii]']",epublish,Oncotarget. 2020 May 12;11(19):1737-1748. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.27580. eCollection 2020 May 12.,,['CONFLICTS OF INTEREST The authors declare no competing interests.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After the impressive results obtained in relapsed and refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and aggressive B-cell lymphomas, two constructs, tisagenlecleucel and axicabtagene ciloleucel, were approved by FDA. The role of CAR T cells in the treatment of B-cell disorders, however, is rapidly evolving. Ongoing clinical trials aim at comparing CAR T cells with standard treatment options and at evaluating their efficacy earlier in the disease course. The use of CAR T cells is still limited by the risk of relevant toxicities, most commonly cytokine release syndrome and neurotoxicity, whose management has nonetheless significantly improved. Some patients do not respond or relapse after treatment, either because of poor CAR T-cell expansion, lack of anti-tumor effects or after the loss of the target antigen on tumor cells. Investigators are trying to overcome these hurdles in many ways: by testing constructs which target different and/or multiple antigens or by improving CAR T-cell structure with additional functions and synergistic molecules. Alternative cell sources including allogeneic products (off-the-shelf CAR T cells), NK cells, and T cells obtained from induced pluripotent stem cells are also considered. Several trials are exploring the curative potential of CAR T cells in other malignancies, and recent data on multiple myeloma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia are encouraging. Given the likely expansion of CAR T-cell indications and their wider availability over time, more and more highly specialized clinical centers, with dedicated clinical units, will be required. Overall, the costs of these cell therapies will also play a role in the sustainability of many health care systems. This review will focus on the major clinical trials of CAR T cells in B-cell malignancies, including those leading to the first FDA approvals, and on the new settings in which these constructs are being tested. Besides, the most promising approaches to improve CAR T-cell efficacy and early data on alternative cell sources will be reviewed. Finally, we will discuss the challenges and the opportunities that are emerging with the advent of CAR T cells into clinical routine.","['Cerrano, Marco', 'Ruella, Marco', 'Perales, Miguel-Angel', 'Vitale, Candida', 'Faraci, Danilo Giuseppe', 'Giaccone, Luisa', 'Coscia, Marta', 'Maloy, Molly', 'Sanchez-Escamilla, Miriam', 'Elsabah, Hesham', 'Fadul, Afraa', 'Maffini, Enrico', 'Pittari, Gianfranco', 'Bruno, Benedetto']","['Cerrano M', 'Ruella M', 'Perales MA', 'Vitale C', 'Faraci DG', 'Giaccone L', 'Coscia M', 'Maloy M', 'Sanchez-Escamilla M', 'Elsabah H', 'Fadul A', 'Maffini E', 'Pittari G', 'Bruno B']","['Department of Oncology/Hematology, A.O.U.

The use of zoledronic acid to enhance TcRgammadelta+ lymphocyte function after TcRalphabeta/CD19-cell depleted haplo-HSCT was tested in an open-label, feasibility, proof-of-principle study. Forty-six children affected by high-risk acute leukemia underwent haplo-HSCT after removal of TcRalphabeta+ and CD19+ B lymphocytes. No post-transplant pharmacological graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) prophylaxis was given. Zoledronic acid was administered monthly at a dose of 0.05 mg/kg/dose (maximum dose 4 mg), starting from day +20 after transplantation. A total of 139 infusions were administered, with a mean of 3 infusions per patient. No severe adverse event was observed. Common side effects were represented by asymptomatic hypocalcemia and acute phase reactions (including fever, chills, malaise, and/or arthralgia) within 24-48 h from zoledronic acid infusion. The cumulative incidence of acute and chronic GvHD was 17.3% (all grade I-II) and 4.8% (all limited), respectively. Patients given 3 or more infusions of zoledronic acid had a lower incidence of both acute GvHD (8.8 vs. 41.6%, p = 0.015) and chronic GvHD (0 vs. 22.2%, p = 0.006). Transplant-related mortality (TRM) and relapse incidence at 3 years were 4.3 and 30.4%, respectively. Patients receiving repeated infusions of zoledronic acid had a lower TRM as compared to those receiving 1 or 2 administration of the drug (0 vs. 16.7%, p = 0.01). Five-year overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) for the whole cohort were 67.2 and 65.2%, respectively, with a trend toward a better OS for patients receiving 3 or more infusions (73.1 vs. 50.0%, p = 0.05). The probability of GvHD/relapse-free survival was significantly worse in patients receiving 1-2 infusions of zoledonic acid than in those given >/=3 infusions (33.3 vs. 70.6%, respectively, p = 0.006). Multivariable analysis showed an independent positive effect on outcome given by repeated infusions of zoledronic acid (HR 0.27, p = 0.03). These data indicate that the use of zoledronic acid after TcRalphabeta/CD19-cell depleted haploHSCT is safe and may result in a lower incidence of acute GvHD, chronic GvHD, and TRM.","['Merli,

In December 2019, an outbreak of atypical pneumonia known as COVID-19 was identified in Wuhan, China. The newly identified zoonotic coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARSCoV-2), is characterized by rapid human-to-human transmission. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients are often in need for intensive chemotherapy to induce remission that will be complicated with prolonged period of cytopenias. They are often recalled to the hospital for treatment and disease surveillance. These patients may be immunocompromised due to the underlying malignancy or anti-cancer therapy. ALL patients are at higher risk of developing life-threatening infections. Several factors increase the risk of infection and the presence of multiple risk factors in the same patient is common. Cancer patients had an estimated 2-fold increased risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2 than the general population. With the World Health Organization declaring the novel coronavirus outbreak a pandemic, there is an urgent need to address the impact of such pandemic on ALL patients. This include changes to resource allocation, clinical care, and the consent process during a pandemic. Currently and due to limited data, there are no international guidelines to address the optimal management of ALL patients in any infectious pandemic. In this review, we will address the potential challenges associated with managing ALL patients during the COVID-19 infection pandemic with suggestions of some practical approaches, focusing on screening asymptomatic ALL patients, diagnostic and response evaluation and choice of chemotherapy in different scenarios and setting and use of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).","['Alhuraiji, Ahmad', 'Eldadah, Saleem', 'Alfraih, Feras', 'Pandita, Ramesh', 'Absi, Ahmad', 'Hanbali, Amr', 'Aljurf, Mahmoud', 'El Fakih, Riad']","['Alhuraiji A', 'Eldadah S', 'Alfraih F', 'Pandita R', 'Absi A', 'Hanbali A', 'Aljurf M', 'El Fakih R']","['Department of hematology, Kuwait Cancer Control Center, Shuwaikh, Kuwait.', 'Adult Hematology/BMT, Princess Noorah Oncology Center, Ministry of the National Guard - Health Affairs, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.', 'Adult Hematology and HSCT, Oncology Center, King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', 'Department of hematology, Kuwait Cancer Control Center, Shuwaikh, Kuwait.', 'Adult Hematology/BMT, Princess Noorah Oncology Center, Ministry of the National Guard - Health Affairs, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.', 'Adult Hematology and HSCT, Oncology Center, King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', 'Adult Hematology and HSCT, Oncology Center, King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', 'Adult Hematology and HSCT, Oncology Center, King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Kuwait,Gulf J Oncolog,The Gulf journal of oncology,101500911,,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects', 'Betacoronavirus/immunology/*pathogenicity', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 Testing', 'Clinical Decision-Making', 'Clinical Laboratory Techniques', 'Coronavirus Infections/diagnosis/immunology/transmission/*virology', 'Critical Pathways', 'Decision Support Techniques', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Humans', '*Immunocompromised Host', 'Opportunistic Infections/diagnosis/immunology/transmission/*virology', 'Pandemics', 'Pneumonia, Viral/diagnosis/immunology/transmission/*virology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/immunology/*therapy', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'SARS-CoV-2']",,,,2020/06/02 06:00,2020/06/04 06:00,['2020/06/02 06:00'],"['2020/04/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/06/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/04 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Gulf J Oncolog. 2020 May;1(33):7-18.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the clinical and laboratory characteristics of the myeloid malignancies may be in fl uenced by the presence of more concomitant mutations. The aim of this study is to provide a further understanding of mutational landscape in the context of RUNX1 mutation in AML/MDS.Methods: The present study screened for 49 mutations using next-generation sequencing (NGS). FLT3-ITD, NPM1, and CEBPA mutations were detected by PCR Sanger sequencing.Results: One or more co-mutations were detected in all AML and 92.3% MDS patients in the context of RUNX1 mutation. The most common co-mutation was DNMT3A, followed by NRAS, IDH1, and FLT3-ITD in AML. The four more frequently co-mutated genes were U2AF1, TET2, PTPN11, and ASXL1 in MDS. We also identified a significantly difference in co-mutational spectrums between RUNX1-mutatedAML and MDS patients, as reflected in incidence of DNMT3A (35.1% vs 7.7%), FLT3-ITD (16.2% vs 0%) and U2AF1 (10.8% vs 30.7%) mutations. RUNX1-mutated AML patients with 3, or >/=4 co-mutations showed much lower CR rate than that with 2 additional mutations (p = 0.0247, 0.00919).Conclusion: RUNX1-mutated AML and MDS are associated with a different complex co-mutation cluster. Some co-mutations have certain influence on the clinical feature and CR rate in the context of RUNX1 mutation.","['Wang, Kai', 'Zhou, Feng', 'Cai, Xiaohui', 'Chao, Hongying', 'Zhang, Ri', 'Chen, Suning']","['Wang K', 'Zhou F', 'Cai X', 'Chao H', 'Zhang R', 'Chen S']","[""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Suzhou University, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Hemostasis of Ministry of Health, Suzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Affiliated Changzhou Second People's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Changzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Affiliated Changzhou Second People's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Changzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Affiliated Changzhou Second People's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Changzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Suzhou University, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Hemostasis of Ministry of Health, Suzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Suzhou University, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Hemostasis of Ministry of Health, Suzhou, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Young Adult']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'RUNX1', 'RUNX1-mutated AML', 'myelodysplastic syndromes', 'next-generation sequencing', 'Sanger sequencing', 'mutations', 'prognosis']",2020/06/02 06:00,2020/12/15 06:00,['2020/06/02 06:00'],"['2020/06/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/06/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/16078454.2020.1765561 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematology. 2020 Dec;25(1):211-218. doi: 10.1080/16078454.2020.1765561.,['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1544-6692'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Only a few case reports have been published regarding the use of topical chlorhexidine disinfectant outside surgery and only a minority of these within the pediatric population. CASE REPORT: We present a case-report of a teenager, treated for acute lymphoblastic leukemia who developed an anaphylactic shock after repeated chlorhexidine use for skin disinfection at the insertion of a central venous catheter during his chemotherapy treatment. Preceding minor symptoms such as local swelling and pruritus were not recognized as possible allergy to chlorhexidine.Management and outcome: He was treated with two doses of intramuscular adrenaline and transferred to the pediatric intensive care unit where he fully recovered. Specific IgE testing was positive for chlorhexidine. A total avoidance of chlorhexidine was instructed. DISCUSSION: A similar case was published regarding an anaphylaxis after use of chlorhexidine disinfectant for a dialysis catheter. Almost all other case reports of anaphylactic shock were found within surgical settings or after insertion of an impregnated central venous catheter/urine catheter. We suggest that some of the disinfectant might have been flushed in the catheter and then caused an anaphylactic reaction. The link between symptoms and chlorhexidine was not made until an anaphylactic reaction occurred. Literature data show that chlorhexidine often causes mild preceding symptoms before an anaphylaxis occurs. So let awareness arise around this 'hidden allergen' of which warning reactions often are being missed.","['Devinck, Astrid', 'Bauters, Tiene', 'Lapeere, Hilde', 'Willems, Leen']","['Devinck A', 'Bauters T', 'Lapeere H', 'Willems L']","['Division of Pediatric Haemato-Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Department of Pediatrics, Ghent University Hospital, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Division of Pediatric Haemato-Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Department of Pediatrics, Ghent University Hospital, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Pharmacy Department, Ghent University Hospital, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Department of Dermatology, Ghent University Hospital, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Division of Pediatric Haemato-Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Department of Pediatrics, Ghent University Hospital, Ghent, Belgium.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20200531,England,J Oncol Pharm Pract,Journal of oncology pharmacy practice : official publication of the International Society of Oncology Pharmacy Practitioners,9511372,"['0 (Anti-Infective Agents, Local)', '0 (Disinfectants)', 'R4KO0DY52L (Chlorhexidine)', 'YKH834O4BH (Epinephrine)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Anaphylaxis/*diagnosis', 'Anti-Infective Agents, Local/adverse effects', 'Chlorhexidine/*adverse effects', 'Disinfectants/adverse effects', 'Disinfection', 'Drug Hypersensitivity/*etiology', 'Epinephrine/administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Chlorhexidine allergy', 'pediatric', 'topical use']",2020/06/02 06:00,2021/01/27 06:00,['2020/06/02 06:00'],"['2020/06/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/27 06:00 [medline]', '2020/06/02 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/1078155220925531 [doi]'],ppublish,J Oncol Pharm Pract. 2021 Jan;27(1):227-231. doi: 10.1177/1078155220925531.

PrE0901 was a phase I multi-center trial evaluating the safety/toxicity of eltrombopag in AML patients receiving HiDAC consolidation. We used a standard 3 + 3 design employing a unique dose-escalation/de-escalation strategy. One hundred four patients were screened, 54 declined participation, 35 were deemed medically ineligible, and 14 were treated on study. Three patients were treated in cohorts 1-4 and two were treated in cohort 5. Eltrombopag + HiDAC was well-tolerated and no dose-limiting toxicities were observed. Median time to platelet recovery of all patients treated was 22.5 (range 16-43) days.

METHODS: A 28-year-old male patient presented complaining painless acute visual impairment in his right eye (RE). He reported moderate asthenia and episodes of night sweats during the previous month. His past medical history was unremarkable. BCVA at presentation was 20/80 in RE and 20/32 in left eye (LE). Fundus examination revealed venous congestion, diffuse Roth spots, and whitish macular infiltrates in both eyes. OCT showed hyperreflective foveal infiltrates, in both eyes. Blood test showed markedly elevated white blood cells (WBCs) count (430 x 10(3)/mm(3)). Clinical-instrumental examination revealed hepatosplenomegaly. These features were consistent with CML. The patient was treated with leukapheresis and nilotinib. RESULTS: After 2 weeks of treatment, the WBCs count dropped (71 x 10(3)/mm(3)), and the patient reported subjective improvement of symptoms. At 1-month follow-up, BCVA and retinopathy signs were improved in both eyes. OCT showed the almost complete resolution of foveal infiltrates with ellipsoid zone focal defects. At 4-months follow-up, we observed complete resolution of retinopathy. BCVA was 20/32 in RE and 20/25 in LE. OCT showed the persistence of ellipsoid zone focal defects in RE and complete anatomical restoration in LE. At 6-months follow-up, the patient was clinically well and his WBCs count was normal. CONCLUSION: In our case, the CML-related retinopathy represented the onset sign of the underlying systemic pathology, leading to proper management and treatment, with hematological normalization and resolution of the retinopathy.","['Vicini, Giulio', 'Nicolosi, Cristina', 'Malandrino, Danilo', 'Tozzetti, Camilla', 'Rizzo, Stanislao', 'Sodi, Andrea']","['Vicini G', 'Nicolosi C', 'Malandrino D', 'Tozzetti C', 'Rizzo S', 'Sodi A']","['Eye Clinic, Neuromuscular and Sense Organs Department, Careggi University Hospital, University of Florence, Florence, Italy.', 'Eye Clinic, Neuromuscular and Sense Organs Department, Careggi University Hospital, University of Florence, Florence, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, Careggi University Hospital, University of Florence, Florence, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, Careggi University Hospital, University of Florence, Florence, Italy.', 'Ophthalmology Unit, Catholic University of the Sacred Heart, Fondazione Policlinico Universitario A.

Exosomes have been identified as new players in the pathogenesis of retroviruses. The different functions of exosomes depend on their cargo components. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate the function of co-regulation differentially expressed proteins in exosomes on coinfection of ALV-J and REV. METHODS: Here, viral replication in CEF cells infected with ALV-J, REV or both was detected by immunofluorescence microscopy. Then, we analyzed the exosomes isolated from supernatants of chicken embryo fibroblast (CEF) cells single infected and coinfected with ALV-J and REV by mass spectrometry. KEGG pathway enrichment analyzed the co-regulation differentially expressed proteins in exosomes. Next, we silenced and overexpressed tripartite motif containing 62 (TRIM62) to evaluate the effects of TRIM62 on viral replication and the expression levels of NCK-association proteins 1 (NCKAP1) and actin-related 2/3 complex subunit 5 (ARPC5) determined by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: The results showed that coinfection of ALV-J and REV promoted the replication of each other. Thirty proteins, including TRIM62, NCK-association proteins 1 (NCKAP1, also known as Nap125), and Arp2/3-5, ARPC5, were identified. NCKAP1 and ARPC5 were involved in the actin cytoskeleton pathway. TRIM62 negatively regulated viral replication and that the inhibition of REV was more significant than that on ALV-J in CEF cells coinfected with TRIM62. In addition, TRIM62 decreased the expression of NCKAP1 and increased the expression of ARPC5 in coinfected CEF cells. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, our results indicated that coinfection with ALV-J and REV competitively promoted each other's replication, the actin cytoskeleton played an important role in the coinfection mechanism, and TRIM62 regulated the actin cytoskeleton.","['Li, Ling', 'Zhuang, Pingping', 'Cheng, Ziqiang', 'Yang, Jie', 'Bi, Jianmin', 'Wang, Guihua']","['Li L', 'Zhuang P', 'Cheng Z', 'Yang J', 'Bi J', 'Wang G']","[""Department of Fundamental Veterinary, College of Veterinary Medicine, Shandong Agricultural University, Tai'an 271018, China."", ""Department of Fundamental Veterinary, College of Veterinary Medicine, Shandong Agricultural University, Tai'an 271018, China."", ""Department of Fundamental Veterinary, College of Veterinary Medicine, Shandong Agricultural University, Tai'an 271018, China."", ""Department of Fundamental Veterinary, College of Veterinary Medicine, Shandong Agricultural University, Tai'an 271018, China."", 'China Animal Husbandry Industry Co.

The present study explores the methylation status of the GGH promoter in peripheral blood and its association with MTX levels and toxicities in Chinese children with ALL. METHODS: Serum MTX concentrations were determined by fluorescence polarization immunoassay. Methylation quantification and genotyping for GGH rs3758149 and rs11545078 was performed by Sequenom MassARRAY in 50 pediatric patients with ALL. RESULTS: Overall, the investigated region of the GGH promoter was in hypomethylated status. The methylation levels of cytosine phosphate guanine (CpG)_7, CpG_12, CpG_17, and CpG_20 were significantly higher in patients with B-cell ALL than other immunotypes (p<0.05). The methylation levels of CpG_13.14, CpG_17, and CpG_19 showed a significant negative correlation with MTX C24 hr (p<0.05). The methylation level of CpG_8.9 correlated significantly with MTX C42 hrs (p<0.05). The methylation level of CpG_19 was significantly lower in patients with MTX toxicities (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The methylation levels of the GGH promoter might affect MTX exposure and toxicities. These findings provided reasonable explanations for the variability of MTX responses in patients with childhood ALL.","['Wang, Shu-Mei', 'Kong, Xiao-Yan', 'Li, Miao', 'Sun, Lu-Lu', 'Yan, Dan']","['Wang SM', 'Kong XY', 'Li M', 'Sun LL', 'Yan D']","['Department of Pharmacy, Beijing Shijitan Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.', 'Beijing Key Laboratory of Bio-characteristic Profiling for Evaluation of Rational Drug Use, Beijing, China.', 'International Cooperation & Joint Laboratory of Bio-characteristic Profiling for Evaluation of Rational Drug Use, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Armed Police Beijing Corps Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Beijing Shijitan Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Beijing Shijitan Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Beijing Shijitan Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.', 'Beijing Key Laboratory of Bio-characteristic Profiling for Evaluation of Rational Drug Use, Beijing, China.', 'International Cooperation & Joint Laboratory of Bio-characteristic Profiling for Evaluation of Rational Drug Use, Beijing, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200616,United States,Pharmacotherapy,Pharmacotherapy,8111305,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'EC 3.4.19.9 (gamma-Glutamyl Hydrolase)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Asians', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'China', 'DNA Methylation/drug effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/*drug therapy', 'gamma-Glutamyl Hydrolase/*blood/drug effects/genetics']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*genetic polymorphisms', '*methotrexate', '*methylation', '*gamma-glutamyl hydrolase']",2020/06/02 06:00,2021/05/19 06:00,['2020/06/02 06:00'],"['2020/06/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/19 06:00 [medline]', '2020/06/02 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/phar.2430 [doi]'],ppublish,Pharmacotherapy. 2020 Jul;40(7):614-622. doi: 10.1002/phar.2430.

METHODS: A total of 55 patients with leukemia (42.09 +/- 16.57 years, 27.3% females) answered the Oral Health Impact Profile, short version (OHIP-14) and underwent a periodontal examination. Associations between periodontal status and total mean OHIP-14 scores were analysed, and the prevalence of high scores was identified for each group. RESULTS: A total mean OHIP-14 score of 13.18 was observed for the entire sample. The corresponding total mean OHIP-14 scores for patients with moderate (n = 18), absent/mild (n = 24), and severe periodontitis (n = 13) were 17.11, 12.50, and 9.00 (P = 0.061), respectively. A higher prevalence of high scores was found for the 'feeling ill-at-ease' question (psychological discomfort domain) for absent/mild and moderate periodontitis patients, whereas those with severe periodontitis had higher prevalence on the 'feeling embarrassed' question (psychosocial disability domain). In the adjusted analysis, hospitalisation was associated with higher OHIP-14 scores (beta = 8.49; 95% CI 1.89-15.08; P = 0.013). Higher OHIP-14 scores were not significantly associated with either patients presenting >15% sites with gingival bleeding or those with moderate/severe periodontitis. CONCLUSION: Leukemia was associated with a negative influence on OHRQoL. However, this association was better explained by the patient's systemic condition than by an impact of its periodontal condition. Nonetheless, patients with leukemia presented with gingivitis and/or periodontitis, pointing to the need for oral health care for these individuals.","['Angst, Patricia Daniela Melchiors', 'Dutra, Danilo Antonio Milbradt', 'Manso, Isabella Schonhofen', 'Moreira, Carlos Heitor Cunha', 'Kantorski, Karla Zanini']","['Angst PDM', 'Dutra DAM', 'Manso IS', 'Moreira CHC', 'Kantorski KZ']","['Periodontics Unit, Department of Conservative Dentistry, Dental School, Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil.', 'Private Practice Dentist, Bage, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil.', 'Graduate Program in Dentistry, Emphasis in Periodontics, Dental School, Federal University of Pelotas, Pelotas, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil.', 'Periodontics Unit, Department of Stomatology, Dental School, Federal University of Santa Maria, Santa Maria, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil.', 'Periodontics Unit, Department of Stomatology, Dental School, Federal University of Santa Maria, Santa Maria, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil.']",['eng'],['Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior'],['Journal Article'],20200531,England,Int Dent J,International dental journal,0374714,,IM,"['Female', '*Gingivitis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*complications', 'Male', 'Oral Health', 'Quality of Life', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Cross-sectional study', 'gingivitis', 'leukemia', 'periodontitis', 'quality of life']",2020/06/02 06:00,2020/09/30 06:00,['2020/06/02 06:00'],"['2020/06/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/30 06:00 [medline]', '2020/06/02 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/idj.12576 [doi]'],ppublish,Int Dent J. 2020 Oct;70(5):381-387. doi: 10.1111/idj.12576.

In this review, we will discuss some of the recently identified mutations that have defined a new molecular landscape in this disease, as well as their prognostic, predictive, and therapeutic implications. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent studies have shown how many cases of AML evolve from a premalignant period of latency characterized by the accumulation of several mutations and the emergence of one or multiple dominant clones. The pattern of co-occurring mutations and cytogenetic abnormalities at diagnosis defines risk and can determine therapeutic approaches to induce remission. Besides the genetic landscape at diagnosis, the continued presence of particular gene mutations during or after treatment carries prognostic information that should further influence strategies to maintain remission in the long term. The recent progress made in AML research is a seminal example of how basic science can translate into improving clinical practice. Our ability to characterize the genomic landscape of individual patients has not only improved our ability to diagnose and prognosticate but is also bringing the promise of precision medicine to fruition in the field.","['Marando, Ludovica', 'Huntly, Brian J P']","['Marando L', 'Huntly BJP']","['Wellcome Trust-MRC Cambridge Stem Cell Institute, Cambridge Biomedical Campus, Cambridge, UK.', 'Department of Haematology, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.', 'Wellcome Trust-MRC Cambridge Stem Cell Institute, Cambridge Biomedical Campus, Cambridge, UK. bjph2@cam.ac.uk.', 'Department of Haematology, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK. bjph2@cam.ac.uk.']",['eng'],"['MC_PC_12009/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'MC_PC_17230/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'MR/R009708/1/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom']","['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200601,United States,Curr Oncol Rep,Current oncology reports,100888967,"['0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Chromosome Aberrations', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/mortality/therapy', 'Mutation', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Prognosis', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics']",PMC7261725,['NOTNLM'],"['*Clonal evolution', '*Genomics', '*Mutations', '*Preleukemia', '*Prognosis', '*Targeted therapy']",2020/06/02 06:00,2021/08/24 06:00,['2020/06/02 06:00'],"['2020/06/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/06/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/24 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s11912-020-00918-7 [doi]', '10.1007/s11912-020-00918-7 [pii]']",epublish,Curr Oncol Rep. 2020 Jun 1;22(6):61. doi: 10.1007/s11912-020-00918-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are detectable in peripheral blood (PB) of virtually all MM cases and are prognostic, but their applicability for noninvasive screening has been poorly investigated. Here, we used next-generation flow (NGF) cytometry to isolate matched CTCs and BM tumor cells from 53 patients and compared their genetic profile. In eight cases, tumor cells from extramedullary (EM) plasmacytomas were also sorted and whole-exome sequencing was performed in the three spatially distributed tumor samples. CTCs were detectable by NGF in the PB of all patients with MM. Based on the cancer cell fraction of clonal and subclonal mutations, we found that ~22% of CTCs egressed from a BM (or EM) site distant from the matched BM aspirate. Concordance between BM tumor cells and CTCs was high for chromosome arm-level copy number alterations (>/=95%) though not for translocations (39%). All high-risk genetic abnormalities except one t(4;14) were detected in CTCs whenever present in BM tumor cells. Noteworthy, >/=82% mutations present in BM and EM clones were detectable in CTCs. Altogether, these results support CTCs for noninvasive risk-stratification of MM patients based on their numbers and genetic profile.","['Garces, Juan-Jose', 'Bretones, Gabriel', 'Burgos, Leire',

The prevalence of BLV in three provinces in the Red River Delta Region in the North of Vietnam, Hanoi, Vinhphuc and Bacninh was studied from April 2017 to June 2018. A total of 275 blood samples collected from cattle were used for serum isolation and DNA extraction. Of these samples, 266 sera were subjected to ELISA test for detecting antibody against BLV gp51 protein and 152 DNA samples were used to detect the 444 bp fragment corresponding to a part of the gp51 region of the env by nested PCR. The results showed that 16.5% (n=44) and 21.1% (n=32) of samples were positive for BLV gp51 antibody and BLV proviral DNA, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis of the partial (423 bp) and complete (913 bp) BLV env-gp51 gene indicated that Vietnamese strains were clustered into genotypes 1, 6 and 10 (G1, G6 and G10). Of those genotypes, G1 genotype was dominant; G6 strains were designated as G6e and G6f subgenotypes; the existence of genotype 10 was confirmed for the first time in Vietnam. The present study provides important information regarding the prevalence of BLV infection and genetic characteristics of BLV strains identified in Vietnam, contributing to promote the establishment of disease control and eradication strategies in Vietnam.","['LE, Dung Thi', 'Yamashita-Kawanishi, Nanako', 'Okamoto, Mari', 'Nguyen, Son Vu', 'Nguyen, Nam Huu', 'Sugiura, Katsuaki', 'Miura, Tomoyuki', 'Haga, Takeshi']","['LE DT', 'Yamashita-Kawanishi N', 'Okamoto M', 'Nguyen SV', 'Nguyen NH', 'Sugiura K', 'Miura T', 'Haga T']","['Division of Infection Control and Disease Prevention, Department of Veterinary Medical Science, Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, The University of Tokyo, 1-1-1 Yayoi, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8657, Japan.', 'Division of Infection Control and Disease Prevention, Department of Veterinary Medical Science, Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, The University of Tokyo, 1-1-1 Yayoi, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8657, Japan.', 'Division of Infection Control and Disease Prevention, Department of Veterinary Medical Science, Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, The University of Tokyo, 1-1-1 Yayoi, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8657, Japan.', 'Department of Veterinary Pathology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Vietnam National University of Agriculture, Hanoi100000, Vietnam.', 'Department of Veterinary Pathology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Vietnam National University of Agriculture, Hanoi100000, Vietnam.', 'Department of Global Agricultural Sciences, Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, The University of Tokyo, 1-1-1 Yayoi, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8657, Japan.', 'Research Center for Infectious Diseases, Institute for Frontier Life and Medical Science, Kyoto University, 53 Shogoin kawahara-cho, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto 606-8507, Japan.', 'Division of Infection Control and Disease Prevention, Department of Veterinary Medical Science, Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, The University of Tokyo, 1-1-1 Yayoi, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8657, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200601,Japan,J Vet Med Sci,The Journal of veterinary medical science,9105360,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral', 'Cattle', 'Enzootic Bovine Leukosis/epidemiology/*virology', 'Female', 'Genes, env/genetics', 'Genome, Viral', 'Genotype', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/*genetics/*isolation & purification', 'Male', 'Phylogeny', 'Vietnam/epidemiology', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/immunology']",PMC7399327,['NOTNLM'],"['Vietnam', 'bovine leukemia virus (BLV)', 'cattle', 'detection', 'genotype']",2020/06/02 06:00,2021/04/02 06:00,['2020/06/02 06:00'],"['2020/06/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/02 06:00 [medline]', '2020/06/02 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1292/jvms.20-0094 [doi]'],ppublish,J Vet Med Sci. 2020 Jul 31;82(7):1042-1050. doi: 10.1292/jvms.20-0094.

With conventional anticancer drugs, including alkylating drugs, anti-metabolite drugs, topoisomerase inhibitors, and microtubule inhibitors-which have been available for half a century-drug resistance often develops because of decreased expression of target enzymes, in conjunction with increased expression of drug export pumps. Alterations of target gene expression and increased export pump function might be caused by epigenetic changes, such as alterations in methylation status, as well as by changes in histone acetylation status. In addition, newly developed anticancer drugs, including small-molecule drugs, such as kinase inhibitors, antibody drugs, and immune modulatory drugs, also resulted in development of drug resistance within 1 year, although these drugs showed significant effectiveness for patients resistant to conventional anticancer drugs. The resistant cells exhibited increased expression of bypass pathways, activation of downstream cascades, decreased expression of antigens of tumor cells, increased DNA repair activity, and increased expression of drug export pumps, which also suggests the presence of epigenetic changes.

In Brazil, information from the Sistema Unico de Saude (SUS) Outpatient Information System indicates that 12,531 patients had the Autorizacao de Procedimento Ambulatorial (APAC) approved for the CML treatment in 2017. Disease monitoring through molecular response evaluation is critical to the care of CML patients. The quantitative PCR test (real-time polymerase chain reaction) provides adequate evaluation parameters that allow the health professional to intervene at the right moments in order to reduce the chance of progression of the disease, providing the best outcome to the patient, including the possibility of treatment discontinuation for eligible patients. Although the test is included in the Clinical Protocol and Therapeutic Guidelines (PCDT) of CML, it is not possible to monitor the molecular response within SUS since there is no reimbursement for this test. OBJECTIVE: Obtain expert recommendations on the importance, financing, and reimbursement of molecular monitoring in SUS. METHODS: Six CML experts with different perspectives participated in the panel. The discussion was based in the main publications about the quantitative PCR test in CML monitoring. RESULTS: Experts' recommendations: CONCLUSION: A solution for the molecular test (BCR-ABL1) funding is urgent to ensure the monitoring of CML patients in SUS. The savings that might be generated with patients that stop taking the medication when adequately monitored may finance the test.","['Boquimpani, Carla Maria', 'Abdo, Andre Neder Ramires', 'Martins, Denise Pires', 'Lima, Luciana Britto de Abreu', 'Torriani, Mayde Seadi', 'Bendit, Israel']","['Boquimpani CM', 'Abdo ANR', 'Martins DP', 'Lima LBA', 'Torriani MS', 'Bendit I']","['HEMORIO, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.', 'Hospital Alemao Oswaldo Cruz (HAOC), Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.', 'Associacao Brasileira de Linfoma e Leucemia (ABRALE), Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.', 'Instituto Nacional de Cancer (INCA), Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.', 'Sociedade Brasileira de Farmaceuticos em Oncologia (SOBRAFO), Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.', 'Departamento de Hematologia, Hospital das Clinicas, Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.

Previous studies have shown that neutrophil elastase (NE) can cleave PML-RARalpha and is important for the development of APL. Here, we demonstrate that one of the cleavage products of PML-RARalpha, NLS-RARalpha, can block cell differentiation by repressing the expression of the target genes within the retinoic acid signalling pathway. The results of reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blot analysis showed that NLS-RARalpha depressed the expression of the cell differentiation marker protein, CD11b and CEBPbeta, as well as the retinoic acid signalling pathway target genes, RARbeta and CEBPepsilon. Studies have shown that NLS-RARalpha forms heterodimers with retinoid X receptor alpha(RXRalpha) and interacts with SMRT. When treated with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), NLS-RARalpha exhibits diminished transcriptional activity compared to RARalpha. Moreover, in the presence of high doses of ATRA, NLS-RARalpha could be degraded along with the consequent transactivation of retinoic acid signalling pathway target genes and cell differentiation induction in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Together, these results indicate that NLS-RARalpha blocks cell differentiation by inhibiting the retinoic acid signalling pathway.","['Li, Jian', 'Zhong, Liang', 'Ye, Jiao', 'Xiong, Ling', 'Yu, Lihua', 'Dan, Wenran', 'Zhong, Pengqiang', 'Yuan, Zhen', 'Liu, Dongdong', 'Yao, Juanjuan', 'Liu, Junmei', 'Liu, Beizhong']","['Li J', 'Zhong L', 'Ye J', 'Xiong L', 'Yu L', 'Dan W', 'Zhong P', 'Yuan Z', 'Liu D', 'Yao J', 'Liu J', 'Liu B']","['Central Laboratory of Yong-Chuan Hospital, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, 402160, China; Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medical Diagnostics, Ministry of Education, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, 400016, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medical Diagnostics, Ministry of Education, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, 400016, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medical Diagnostics, Ministry of Education, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, 400016, China.', 'Central Laboratory of Yong-Chuan Hospital, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, 402160, China.', 'Central Laboratory of Yong-Chuan Hospital, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, 402160, China.', 'Central Laboratory of Yong-Chuan Hospital, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, 402160, China.', 'Central Laboratory of Yong-Chuan Hospital, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, 402160, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medical Diagnostics, Ministry of Education, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, 400016, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medical Diagnostics, Ministry of Education, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, 400016, China.', 'Central Laboratory of Yong-Chuan Hospital, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, 402160, China.', 'Central Laboratory of Yong-Chuan Hospital, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, 402160, China.', 'Central Laboratory of Yong-Chuan Hospital, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, 402160, China; Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medical Diagnostics, Ministry of Education, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, 400016, China.

It is urgent to find a non-toxic natural drug to treat AML. Herein, the selenium nanoparticles (SeNPs) embedded in nanotubes consisted of triple helix beta-(1, 3)-d-glucan (BFP) from the black fungus that were wrapped to form stable inclusion complex BFP-Se, which was self-assembled and exhibited high stability in water. In vitro, the BFP-Se significantly inhibited the proliferation of AML cells and increased the cytotoxicity on AML cells. On single-cell levels, the U937 cells were gradually swelled and lysed with BFP-Se treatment on optofluidics chips. Further, the blood and bone marrow analysis indicated the anti-leukemia effects of BFP-Se in vivo. Moreover, BFP-Se increased the total antioxidant capacity of AML cells and decreased the expression of c-Jun activation domain-binding protein 1 and thioredoxin 1. Our results suggest that this biocompatible polysaccharide nanotube containing Se nanoparticles would provide a novel strategy for AML therapy.","['Jin, Yanxia', 'Cai, Liqin', 'Yang, Qian', 'Luo, Ziyi', 'Liang, Li', 'Liang, Yuxing', 'Wu, Balu', 'Ding, Lu', 'Zhang, Dongdong', 'Xu, Xiaojuan', 'Zhang, Lina', 'Zhou, Fuling']","['Jin Y', 'Cai L', 'Yang Q', 'Luo Z', 'Liang L', 'Liang Y', 'Wu B', 'Ding L', 'Zhang D', 'Xu X', 'Zhang L', 'Zhou F']","['Department of Hematology, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, 430071, China; Hubei Key Laboratory of Edible Wild Plants Conservation and Utilization, College of Life Sciences, Hubei Normal University, Huangshi, 435002, China.', 'College of Chemistry and Molecular Sciences, Hubei Engineering Center of Natural Polymer-Based Medical Materials, Wuhan University, Wuhan, 430072, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, 430071, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, 430071, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Artificial Micro- and Nano-Structures of Ministry of Education, School of Physics and Technology, Wuhan University, Wuhan, 430072, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, 430071, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, 430071, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, 430071, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, 430071, China.', 'College of Chemistry and Molecular Sciences, Hubei Engineering Center of Natural Polymer-Based Medical Materials, Wuhan University, Wuhan, 430072, China.', 'College of Chemistry and Molecular Sciences, Hubei Engineering Center of Natural Polymer-Based Medical Materials, Wuhan University, Wuhan, 430072, China.

We hypothesized similar deficits would be observed in auditory attention relative to previous literature indicating weakness with aspect of visual attention in this population. Survivors (n = 107, 53 females, M = 12.80 years) completed the Conners Continuous Auditory Test of Attention (CATA). Parents completed the Behavior Assessment System for Children, Second Edition and reported educational performance and services via structured questionnaire. Results indicated several CATA indices associated with sustained auditory attention were significantly worse than normative data, though group means were average. Reflecting individual variability in performance, 50% of the sample performed worse than one standard deviation from the mean on at least one CATA variable. Parent report of attention did not differ from normative means for the sample. Parent-report data indicated that 60% of the sample utilized academic support services, with a large proportion of survivors having utilized special education services. Poorer performance with sustained auditory attention was associated with poor academic outcomes. Greater methotrexate exposure and younger age at diagnosis were risk factors for inattentiveness. No gender differences were identified on direct assessment of auditory attention or parent report of attention, though male gender was associated with poorer educational performance. Findings suggest that auditory attention is an at-risk cognitive domain following treatment for pediatric ALL, and that an association exists between auditory attention and school performance in this population.","['Holland, Alice Ann', 'Clem, Matthew A', 'Lampson, Erin', 'Stavinoha, Peter L']","['Holland AA', 'Clem MA', 'Lampson E', 'Stavinoha PL']","['Department of Psychiatry, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center , Dallas, TX, USA.', ""Department of Psychiatry, Children's Medical Center Dallas , Dallas, TX, USA."", 'Department of Psychiatry, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center , Dallas, TX, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics (EL), University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center , USA.', 'Department of Psychiatry, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center , Dallas, TX, USA.', ""Department of Psychiatry, Children's Medical Center Dallas , Dallas, TX, USA.""]",['eng'],['UL1 TR001105/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200601,England,Child Neuropsychol,Child neuropsychology : a journal on normal and abnormal development in childhood and adolescence,9512515,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Attention/*physiology', 'Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity/*etiology', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications/psychology', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Survivors/*psychology']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Pediatric', '*attention', '*late effects', '*leukemia', '*neuropsychology']",2020/06/02 06:00,2021/02/02 06:00,['2020/06/02 06:00'],"['2020/06/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/02 06:00 [medline]', '2020/06/02 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/09297049.2020.1772738 [doi]'],ppublish,Child Neuropsychol. 2020 Oct;26(7):865-880. doi: 10.1080/09297049.2020.1772738.

METHODS: In a case-cohort study with follow-up of 110 631 Chinese workers during 1972-1999, we evaluated benzene exposure-response for non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), lymphoid leukemias (LL), acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), and total lymphoid neoplasms (LN). We estimated benzene exposures using state-of-the-art hierarchical modeling of occupational factors calibrated with historical routine measurements and evaluated cumulative exposure-response using Cox regression. RESULTS: NHL and other specified LN were increased in exposed vs unexposed workers. However, there was no evidence of exposure-response for NHL or other specified LN. Based on a linear exposure-response, relative risks at 100 parts per million-years (RR at 100 ppm-years) for cumulative benzene exposure using a 2-year lag (exposure at least 2 years before the time at risk) were 1.05 for NHL (95 percent confidence interval (CI) = 0.97, 1.27; 32 cases), 1.11 for LL (95% CI < 0, 1.66; 12 cases), 1.21 for ALL (95% CI < 0, 3.53; 10 cases), and 1.02 for total LN (95% CI < 0, 1.16; 49 cases). No statistically significant exposure-response trends were apparent for these LN for 2 to <10-year or >/=10-year lags. NHL risks were not significantly modified by sex, age, or year at first exposure, attained age, or time since exposure. CONCLUSION: Given the study strengths and limitations, we found little evidence of exposure-response for benzene and NHL, LL, ALL, or total LN, although NHL and other specified LN were increased in exposed vs unexposed individuals.","['Linet, Martha S', 'Gilbert, Ethel S', 'Vermeulen, Rudolf', 'Dores, Graca M', 'Yin, Song-Nian', 'Portengen, Lutzen', 'Hayes, Richard B', 'Ji, Bu-Tian', 'Lan, Qing', 'Li, Gui-Lan', 'Rothman, Nathaniel']","['Linet MS', 'Gilbert ES', 'Vermeulen R', 'Dores GM', 'Yin SN', 'Portengen L', 'Hayes RB', 'Ji BT', 'Lan Q', 'Li GL', 'Rothman N']","['Radiation Epidemiology Branch, Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, NIH, DHHS, Rockville, Maryland.', 'Radiation Epidemiology Branch, Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, NIH, DHHS, Rockville, Maryland.', 'Division of Environmental Epidemiology, Institute for Risk Assessment Sciences, Utrecht University, Utrecht, the Netherlands.', 'Radiation Epidemiology Branch, Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, NIH, DHHS, Rockville, Maryland.', 'Analytic Epidemiology Branch, Division of Epidemiology, Office of Biostatistics and Epidemiology, Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, US Food and Drug Administration, Silver Spring, Maryland.', ""National Institute of Occupational Health and Poison Control, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Beijing, People's Republic of China."", 'Institute for Risk Assessment Sciences, Utrecht University, Utrecht, the Netherlands.', 'Division of Epidemiology, Department of Population Health, New York University School of Medicine, New York, New York.', 'Occupational and Environmental Epidemiology Branch, Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, NIH, DHHS, Rockville, Maryland.', 'Occupational and Environmental Epidemiology Branch, Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, NIH, DHHS, Rockville, Maryland.', ""National Institute of Occupational Health and Poison Control, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Beijing, People's Republic of China."", 'Occupational and Environmental Epidemiology Branch, Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, NIH, DHHS, Rockville, Maryland.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",20200531,United States,Am J Ind Med,American journal of industrial medicine,8101110,['J64922108F (Benzene)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Benzene/*analysis/toxicity', 'China/epidemiology', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/chemically induced/*epidemiology', 'Lymphoma/chemically induced/*epidemiology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Occupational Diseases/chemically induced/*epidemiology', 'Occupational Exposure/adverse effects/*analysis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Regression Analysis', 'Risk', 'Young Adult']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*benzene', '*case-cohort study', '*leukemia', '*lymphoid', '*non-Hodgkin lymphoma', '*occupational exposure']",2020/06/01 06:00,2021/07/10 06:00,['2020/06/01 06:00'],"['2020/03/07 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/15 00:00 [revised]', '2020/05/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/10 06:00 [medline]', '2020/06/01 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajim.23142 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Ind Med. 2020 Sep;63(9):741-754. doi: 10.1002/ajim.23142.

PD-1 expression on T-cell subsets was measured using flow cytometric analysis. PD-1 expression levels on CD8+ T-cells were significantly lower in complete hematologic response (CHR) than in controls, chronic phase, and blast phase (BP). In CML patients receiving imatinib and dasatinib, PD-1 expression levels on CD8+ T-cells were lower than that at diagnosis.

PD-1 expression levels on CD4+ T-cells did not differ significantly according to different medications or quantitative BCR/ABL1 fusion gene levels. Low PD-1 expression on CD8+ T-cells might play a role in maintaining CHR in CML patients. Immune monitoring of PD-1 expression on CD8+ T-cells may predict the disease course.

The renin angiotensin system (RAS) contributes to hypertension genesis and plays an important role in atherosclerosis development, proliferation, and differentiation of myeloid hematopoietic cells. We analyzed a cohort of 192 patients with hypertension at CML diagnosis, who were treated with 2nd- or 3rd-generation TKIs, and evaluated the efficacy of RAS inhibitors (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin-II receptor blockers (ARBs)) in the prevention of arterial occlusive events (AOEs), as compared with other drug classes. The 5-year cumulative incidence of AOEs was 32.7 +/- 4.2%. Patients with SCORE >/= 5% (high-very-high) showed a significantly higher incidence of AOEs (33.7 +/- 7.6% vs 13.6 +/- 4.8%, p = 0.006). The AOE incidence was significantly lower in patients treated with RAS inhibitors (14.8 +/- 4.2% vs 44 +/- 1%, p < 0.001, HR = 0.283). The difference in the low and intermediate Sokal risk group was confirmed but not in the high-risk group, where a lower RAS expression has been reported. Our data suggest that RAS inhibitors may represent an optimal treatment in patients with hypertension and CML, treated with 2nd or 3rd(G) TKIs.","['Mulas, Olga', 'Caocci, Giovanni', 'Stagno, Fabio', 'Bonifacio, Massimiliano', 'Annunziata, Mario', 'Luciano, Luigiana', 'Orlandi, Ester Maria', 'Abruzzese, Elisabetta', 'Sgherza, Nicola', 'Martino, Bruno', 'Albano, Francesco', 'Galimberti, Sara', 'Pregno, Patrizia', 'Bocchia, Monica', 'Castagnetti, Fausto', 'Tiribelli, Mario', 'Binotto, Gianni', 'Gozzini, Antonella', 'Capodanno, Isabella', 'Fozza, Claudio', 'Luzi, Debora', 'Efficace, Fabio', 'Simula, Maria Pina', 'Scaffidi, Luigi', 'De Gregorio, Fiorenza', 'Elena, Chiara', 'Trawinska, Malgorzata Monika', 'Cattaneo, Daniele', 'Attolico, Imma', 'Barate, Claudia', 'Pirillo, Francesca', 'Sicuranza, Anna', 'Gugliotta, Gabriele', 'Stella, Rossella', 'Scalzulli, Emilia', 'Iurlo, Alessandra', 'Foa, Robin', 'Breccia, Massimo', 'La Nasa, Giorgio']","['Mulas O', 'Caocci G', 'Stagno F', 'Bonifacio M', 'Annunziata M', 'Luciano L', 'Orlandi EM', 'Abruzzese E', 'Sgherza N', 'Martino B', 'Albano F', 'Galimberti S', 'Pregno P', 'Bocchia M', 'Castagnetti F', 'Tiribelli M', 'Binotto G', 'Gozzini A', 'Capodanno I', 'Fozza C', 'Luzi D', 'Efficace F', 'Simula MP', 'Scaffidi L', 'De Gregorio F', 'Elena C', 'Trawinska MM', 'Cattaneo D', 'Attolico I', 'Barate C', 'Pirillo F', 'Sicuranza A', 'Gugliotta G', 'Stella R', 'Scalzulli E', 'Iurlo A', 'Foa R', 'Breccia M', 'La Nasa G']","['Department of Medical Sciences and Public Health, University of Cagliari, Hematology Businco Hospital, Cagliari, Italy.', 'Department of Medical Sciences and Public Health, University of Cagliari, Hematology Businco Hospital, Cagliari, Italy. giovanni.caocci@unica.it.', 'SC Ematologia e CTMO, Ospedale Businco, Dipartimento di Scienze Mediche e Sanita Pubblica, Universita di Cagliari, Via Jenner, sn, 09124, Cagliari, Italy. giovanni.caocci@unica.it.', 'Hematology, Section and BMT Unit, Rodolico Hospital, AOU Policlinico - V.

Marrow adipose tissue (MAT) is a unique and versatile component of the bone marrow niche. While the importance of MAT for bone health has long been recognized, its complex role in hematopoiesis has only recently gained attention. In this review article we summarize recent conceptual advances in the field of MAT research and how these developments impact our understanding of MAT regulation of hematopoiesis. Elucidating routes of interaction and regulation between MAT and cells of the hematopoietic system are essential to pinpoint vulnerable processes resulting in malignant transformation. The concept of white adipose tissue contributing to cancer development and progression on the cellular, metabolic, and systemic level is generally accepted. The role of MAT in malignant hematopoiesis, however, is controversial. MAT is very sensitive to changes in the patient's metabolic status hampering a clear definition of its role in different clinical situations. Here, we discuss future directions for leukemia research in the context of metabolism-induced modifications of MAT and other adipose tissues and how this might impact on leukemia cell survival, proliferation, and antileukemic therapy.","['Zinngrebe, Julia', 'Debatin, Klaus-Michael', 'Fischer-Posovszky, Pamela']","['Zinngrebe J', 'Debatin KM', 'Fischer-Posovszky P']","['Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Ulm University Medical Centre, D-89075, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Ulm University Medical Centre, D-89075, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Ulm University Medical Centre, D-89075, Ulm, Germany. pamela.fischer@uniklinik-ulm.de.']",['eng'],"['CRC 1074/Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (German Research', 'Foundation)/International', 'FI 1700/7-1/Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (German Research', 'Foundation)/International', 'Margarete-von-Wrangell scholarship/Ministerium fur Wissenschaft, Forschung und', 'Kunst Baden-Wurttemberg (Ministry of Science, Research and Art', 'Baden-Wurttemberg)/International']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20200530,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adipocytes/*pathology', 'Animals', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Tumor Microenvironment']",PMC7449871,,,2020/06/01 06:00,2020/11/20 06:00,['2020/06/01 06:00'],"['2020/04/15 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/15 00:00 [revised]', '2020/06/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/20 06:00 [medline]', '2020/06/01 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-020-0886-x [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-020-0886-x [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2020 Sep;34(9):2305-2316. doi: 10.1038/s41375-020-0886-x.

Its presence places the patient into a high-risk group. We aimed to describe the outcome of pediatric AML with FLT3-ITD mutation. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of cases of AML from July 2007 till July 2017 at Children's Cancer Hospital Egypt. RESULTS: Seventy-one patients had FLT3 gene mutation out of 687 patients with AML. Sixty-five patients had FLT3 gene mutation with allelic ratio > 0.4; 43 (66.1%) of 65 patients experienced complete remission (CR). Of the 43 patients, 16 patients maintained CR, 18 patients relapsed after first CR, 8 patients died, and 1 patient was lost to follow-up. Patients with relapsing disease died after salvage chemotherapy, except for one patient, who was alive after second CR. Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (allo-BMT) was performed for 9 (13.8%) of 65 patients in first CR, of whom 8 were alive and in CR, and 1 patient experienced disease relapse and died. Seven patients (10.7%) were alive without allo-BMT. Three years' overall and event-free survival for patients with FLT3-ITD mutation with high allelic ratio was 26.9% and 22.8%, respectively. Three years' overall and event-free survival for patients treated with allo-BMT was 77.8% and 78.8%, respectively, versus patients treated without allo-BMT, 16.3% and 12.8%, respectively. CONCLUSION: FLT3-ITD mutation in pediatric AML was associated with poor treatment outcomes, and the survival of relapsing patients was extremely poor. Allo-BMT in first remission was the best treatment option. Alternative donor transplants and FLT3 inhibitors are needed to improve outcome in developing countries.","['Semary, Samah Fathy', 'Hammad, Mahmoud', 'Soliman, Sonya', 'Yassen, Dina', 'Gamal, Marwa', 'Albeltagy, Doaa', 'Hamdy, Nayera', 'Mahmoud, Sonia']","['Semary SF', 'Hammad M', 'Soliman S', 'Yassen D', 'Gamal M', 'Albeltagy D', 'Hamdy N', 'Mahmoud S']","[""Department of Clinical Oncology, Faculty of Medicine, Beni-Suef University, Beni-Suef, Egypt; Department of Pediatric Oncology, Children's Cancer Hospital Egypt, Cairo, Egypt.

Human lung pericytes (HuL-P) examined in this study expressed two representative pericyte markers; platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta (PDGFRB) and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan 4 (CSPG4), and were able to migrate and cover endothelial tubes in 3D conditions, indicating that they retain characteristics of pericytes. Moreover HuL-P cells transitioned to myofibroblast-like cells in the presence of transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta signaling or to pericyte-like cells in the absence of TGF-beta signaling (pericyte-myofibroblast transition). On the other hand, the FF detected in this study were invariably localized between peripheral lung epithelia and capillary endothelia, the basement membranes of which are physiologically fused. The localization is highly specific in that the only cells that exist between the gap are pericytes. As expected, FF were immunohistochemically positive for PDGFRB and CSPG4, suggesting that pericytes are activated to form FF. We also found that HuL-P cells were difficult to eradicate by dual silencing of Bcl-xL plus MCL1. It would be more sensible to suppress pericyte-myofibroblast transition than to kill activated myofibroblasts for the treatment of IPF.","['Yamaguchi, Miki', 'Hirai, Sachie', 'Tanaka, Yusuke', 'Sumi, Toshiyuki', 'Tada, Makoto', 'Takahashi, Hiroki', 'Watanabe, Atsushi', 'Sakuma, Yuji']","['Yamaguchi M', 'Hirai S', 'Tanaka Y', 'Sumi T', 'Tada M', 'Takahashi H', 'Watanabe A', 'Sakuma Y']","['Department of Molecular Medicine, Research Institute for Frontier Medicine, Sapporo Medical University School of Medicine, Sapporo, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, Research Institute for Frontier Medicine, Sapporo Medical University School of Medicine, Sapporo, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, Research Institute for Frontier Medicine, Sapporo Medical University School of Medicine, Sapporo, Japan; Department of Respiratory Medicine and Allergology, Sapporo Medical University School of Medicine, Sapporo, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, Research Institute for Frontier Medicine, Sapporo Medical University School of Medicine, Sapporo, Japan; Department of Respiratory Medicine and Allergology, Sapporo Medical University School of Medicine, Sapporo, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, Research Institute for Frontier Medicine, Sapporo Medical University School of Medicine, Sapporo, Japan; Department of Thoracic Surgery, Sapporo Medical University School of Medicine, Sapporo, Japan.', 'Department of Respiratory Medicine and Allergology, Sapporo Medical University School of Medicine, Sapporo, Japan.', 'Department of Thoracic Surgery, Sapporo Medical University School of Medicine, Sapporo, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, Research Institute for Frontier Medicine, Sapporo Medical University School of Medicine, Sapporo, Japan.

However, in select circumstances, these simple diagnoses can be quite complex. In part, diagnostic difficulty may be due to uncertainty in the evaluation of morphologic and immunophenotypic features along a biologic continuum, or alternatively arise from uncertainty in predicting the behavior and outcomes of patients. Here, we systematically discuss and review areas of diagnostic difficulty in the diagnosis of large B-cell lymphomas (LBCL), classic Hodgkin lymphomas (CHL) and peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCL). We provide careful data-driven analyses and evidence-based approaches to help guide pathologists and clinicians. We discuss: 1) marginal zone lymphomas with increased large cells versus diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), 2) chronic lymphocytic leukemia with expanded proliferation centers versus diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), 3) chronic lymphocytic leukemia with Hodgkin/Reed-Sternberg-like cells versus CHL arising from chronic lymphocytic leukemia, 4) complex cases of follicular lymphoma versus DLBCL, 5) PTCL with large B-cell proliferations versus PTCL with LBCL, 6) PTCL with Hodgkin/Reed-Sternberg-like cells versus CHL, and finally 7) blastoid/pleomorphic mantle cell lymphoma versus DLBCL.

Among these, abnormally elevated kinase activity of PIM-1 contributes to the progression of gastric cancer and predicts poor prognosis and a low survival rate in gastric cancer patients. In the present study, we found that resveratrol, one of the representative chemopreventive and anticarcinogenic phytochemicals, directly binds to PIM-1 and thereby inhibits its catalytic activity in human gastric cancer SNU-601 cells. This resulted in suppression of phosphorylation of the proapoptotic Bad, a known substrate of PIM-1. Resveratrol, by inactivating PIM-1, also inhibited anchorage-independent growth and proliferation of SNU-601 cells. To understand the molecular interaction between resveratrol and PIM-1, we conducted docking simulation and found that resveratrol directly binds to the PIM-1 at the ATP-binding pocket. In conclusion, the proapototic and anti-proliferative effects of resveratrol in gastric cancer cells are likely to be mediated through suppression of PIM-1 kinase activity, which may represent a novel mechanism underlying its chemopreventive and anticarcinogenic actions.","['Kim, Sujin', 'Kim, Wonki', 'Kim, Do-Hee', 'Jang, Jeong-Hoon', 'Kim, Su-Jung', 'Park, Sin-Aye', 'Hahn, Hyunggu', 'Han, Byung Woo', 'Na, Hye-Kyung', 'Chun, Kyung-Soo', 'Choi, Bu Young', 'Surh, Young-Joon']","['Kim S', 'Kim W', 'Kim DH', 'Jang JH', 'Kim SJ', 'Park SA', 'Hahn H', 'Han BW', 'Na HK', 'Chun KS', 'Choi BY', 'Surh YJ']","['Department of Molecular Medicine and Biopharmaceutical Sciences, Graduate School of Convergence Science and Technology, Seoul National University, Seoul 08826, South Korea; Tumor Microenvironment Global Core Research Center, College of Pharmacy, Seoul National University, Seoul 08826, South Korea.', 'Tumor Microenvironment Global Core Research Center, College of Pharmacy, Seoul National University, Seoul 08826, South Korea.', 'Department of Chemistry, College of Convergence and Integrated Science, Kyonggi University, Suwon, Gyeonggi-do 16227, South Korea.', 'Tumor Microenvironment Global Core Research Center, College of Pharmacy, Seoul National University, Seoul 08826, South Korea.', 'Tumor Microenvironment Global Core Research Center, College of Pharmacy, Seoul National University, Seoul 08826, South Korea.', 'Department of Biomedical Laboratory Science, College of Medical Sciences, Soonchunhyang University, Asan 31538, South Korea.', 'Tumor Microenvironment Global Core Research Center, College of Pharmacy, Seoul National University, Seoul 08826, South Korea.', 'Tumor Microenvironment Global Core Research Center, College of Pharmacy, Seoul National University, Seoul 08826, South Korea.', ""Department of Food Science and Biotechnology, College of Knowledge-based Services Engineering, Sungshin Women's University, Seoul 01133, South Korea."", 'Department of Pharmacy, College of Pharmacy, Keimyung University, Daegu 42601, South Korea.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Science and Engineering, Seowon University, Cheongju, Chungbuk 28674, South Korea.

Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) is commonly offered as a consolidative treatment option in RS. To our knowledge, there are no randomized controlled studies that have compared allo-HCT against other therapies in RS; available allo-HCT data are limited to small case series from single-institution or registry studies. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the totality of evidence regarding the efficacy (or lack thereof) of allo-HCT for RS. We extracted data on post-allograft outcomes related to benefits (overall response rate [ORR], complete remission [CR], OS, and progression-free survival [PFS]). For harms, data were extracted on non-relapse mortality (NRM) and relapse post-allografting. Our search strategy identified 240 studies, but only four studies (n = 72 patients) met our inclusion criteria. Pooled ORR, CR, OS, and PFS rates were 79%, 33%, 49%, and 30%, respectively. Pooled NRM and relapse rates were 24% and 28%, respectively. Results of this systematic review and meta-analysis indicate that allo-HCT yields encouraging OS in RS, thus remaining a reasonable treatment option in fit patients whose disease demonstrates a chemosensitive response to pre-transplant salvage therapies. Novel strategies are certainly needed to reduce the risk of relapse to further improve outcomes in these patients.","['Aulakh, Sonikpreet', 'Reljic, Tea', 'Yassine, Farah', 'Ayala, Ernesto', 'Chavez, Julio C', 'Chanan-Khan, Asher', 'Pinilla-Ibarz, Javier', 'Kumar, Ambuj', 'Kharfan-Dabaja, Mohamed A']","['Aulakh S', 'Reljic T', 'Yassine F', 'Ayala E', 'Chavez JC', 'Chanan-Khan A', 'Pinilla-Ibarz J', 'Kumar A', 'Kharfan-Dabaja MA']","['Division of Hematology-Oncology, West Virginia University, Morgantown, WV, USA.', 'Program for Comparative Effectiveness Research, Morsani College of Medicine, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL, USA.', 'Faculty of Medicine, American University of Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology and Blood and Marrow Transplantation Program, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, FL, USA.', 'Department of Malignant Hematology, Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, FL, USA.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology and Blood and Marrow Transplantation Program, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, FL, USA.', 'Department of Malignant Hematology, Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, FL, USA.', 'Program for Comparative Effectiveness Research, Morsani College of Medicine, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL, USA.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology and Blood and Marrow Transplantation Program, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, FL, USA.

An objective screening test to identify patients at risk for symptomatic, extensive joint involvement will help manage osteonecrosis. METHODS: We performed a prospective, longitudinal pilot study with whole-joint magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of shoulders, elbows, hips, knees, ankles, and hindfeet to evaluate the incidence and timing of osteonecrosis involving multiple joints in 15 patients with LLy aged 9-21 years at diagnosis. RESULTS: Osteonecrosis affecting >/=30% of the epiphysis occurred in eight of 15 patients, with a high prevalence in hips (12 of 26 examined [46%]) and knees (10 of 26 [38%]) post reinduction I and in shoulders (seven of 20 [35%]) post reinduction II. Most osteonecrotic hips and knees with >/=30% epiphyseal involvement became symptomatic and/or underwent surgery (100% and 82%, respectively). All eight patients with >/=30% epiphyseal involvement had multijoint involvement. Seven of these patients had hip or knee osteonecrosis by the end of remission induction, and only these patients developed osteonecrosis that became symptomatic and/or underwent surgery in their hips, knees, shoulders, ankles, and/or feet; all of these joints were associated with epiphyseal abnormalities on post reinduction I imaging. CONCLUSIONS: MRI screening in adolescent patients with LLy revealed osteonecrosis in multiple joints. Initial screening with hip and knee MRI at the end of induction may identify susceptible patients who could benefit from referrals to subspecialties, more extensive follow-up imaging of other joints, and early medical and surgical interventions.","['Inaba, Hiroto', 'Varechtchouk, Olga', 'Neel, Michael D', 'Ehrhardt, Matthew J', 'Metzger, Monika L', 'Karol, Seth E', 'Ness, Kirsten K', 'Ribeiro, Raul C', 'Pui, Ching-Hon', 'Relling, Mary V', 'Sandlund, John T', 'Kaste, Sue C']","['Inaba H', 'Varechtchouk O', 'Neel MD', 'Ehrhardt MJ', 'Metzger ML', 'Karol SE', 'Ness KK', 'Ribeiro RC', 'Pui CH', 'Relling MV', 'Sandlund JT', 'Kaste SC']","[""Department of Oncology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, Tennessee.', ""Department of Oncology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Surgery, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Oncology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, Tennessee.', ""Department of Epidemiology and Cancer Control, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Oncology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, Tennessee.', ""Department of Global Pediatric Medicine, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Oncology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, Tennessee.', ""Department of Epidemiology and Cancer Control, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Oncology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, Tennessee.', ""Department of Oncology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, Tennessee.', ""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", 'Department of Clinical Pharmacy, University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, Tennessee.', ""Department of Oncology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, Tennessee.', ""Department of Oncology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Diagnostic Imaging, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", 'Department of Radiology, University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, Tennessee.']",['eng'],"['P30 CA021765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200530,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Joints/*diagnostic imaging', '*Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', '*Osteonecrosis/diagnosis/epidemiology/surgery', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnostic imaging/epidemiology/therapy', 'Risk Factors']",PMC7391358,['NOTNLM'],"['*acute lymphoblastic lymphoma', '*magnetic resonance imaging', '*osteonecrosis', '*pediatrics', '*whole joints']",2020/05/31 06:00,2020/09/08 06:00,['2020/05/31 06:00'],"['2019/12/19 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/04 00:00 [revised]', '2020/03/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/08 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/31 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.28336 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2020 Aug;67(8):e28336. doi: 10.1002/pbc.28336.

A lack of reliable tools for in vivo imaging has hampered the development of H2 O2 mediated therapeutics. By combining a specific tandem Payne/Dakin reaction with a chemiluminescent scaffold, H2 O2 -CL-510 was developed as a highly selective and sensitive probe for detection of H2 O2 both in vitro and in vivo. A rapid 430-fold enhancement of chemiluminescence was triggered directly by H2 O2 without any laser excitation. Arsenic trioxide induced oxidative damage in leukemia was successfully detected. In particular, cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury-induced H2 O2 fluxes were visualized in rat brains using H2 O2 -CL-510, providing a new chemical tool for real-time monitoring of H2 O2 dynamics in living animals.","['Ye, Sen', 'Hananya, Nir', 'Green, Ori', 'Chen, Hansen', 'Zhao, Angela Qian', 'Shen, Jiangang', 'Shabat, Doron', 'Yang, Dan']","['Ye S', 'Hananya N', 'Green O', 'Chen H', 'Zhao AQ', 'Shen J', 'Shabat D', 'Yang D']","['Morningside Laboratory for Chemical Biology and Department of Chemistry, The University of Hong Kong Shenzhen Institute of Research and Innovation (HKU-SIRI), The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam Road, Hong Kong, P.

METHODS: Clinical data and the cytogenetic results of 99 patients with hematopathies and aberrations of chromosome 6 were analyzed. RESULTS: The patients mainly had acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), lymphoma, multiple myeloma, and myelodysplastic syndrome. ALL was the most common among the selected disorders. Based on their main abnormalities, ALL patients were divided into +6/-6, 6p and 6q groups. No significant difference was found in the gender, hemoglobin and platelet count between the three groups (P> 0.05). The age and white cell count in those with 6q aberrations were significantly higher compared with the +6/-6 group (P< 0.05). Multivariate COX analysis suggested that the 6p/6q aberrations and age are risk factors for the prognosis. The 1-year overall survival rate of the 6p and 6q groups were lower than that of the +6/-6 group (P< 0.05). CONCLUSION: Aberrations of chromosome 6 are common in B-cell disease, and patients with ALL and 6q aberration have a poorer prognosis. Analysis of chromosome 6 aberration has a significance for the prognosis.","['Luo, Qingwen', 'Chen, Wanzi']","['Luo Q', 'Chen W']","['Fujian Institute of Hematology, Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory of Hematology, Union Hospital, Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, Fujian 350001, China. cwz19830219@126.com.']",['chi'],,['Journal Article'],,China,Zhonghua Yi Xue Yi Chuan Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua yi xue yi chuan xue za zhi = Zhonghua yixue yichuanxue zazhi = Chinese journal of medical genetics,9425197,,IM,"['Chromosome Aberrations', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 6', 'Humans', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Rate']",,,,2020/05/31 06:00,2020/10/24 06:00,['2020/05/31 06:00'],"['2020/05/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/05/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/24 06:00 [medline]']","['940637137 [pii]', '10.3760/cma.j.issn.1003-9406.2020.06.017 [doi]']",ppublish,Zhonghua Yi Xue Yi Chuan Xue Za Zhi. 2020 Jun 10;37(6):665-668. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.issn.1003-9406.2020.06.017.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To clarify the underlying pathogenesis of AML and provide new therapeutic targets for clinical treatment, we explore the role of circRNA in leukemia. METHODS: High-throughput circRNA sequencing analysis was performed in patients with leukemia and healthy donors. RT-qPCR and western blot analysis were used to determine expression of GSK3beta. RNA pull-down assay was used to detect miRNAs pulled down by hsa_circ_0121582. RNA immunoprecipitation assay was performed to evaluate the binding capacity between TET1 and hsa_circ_0121582. RESULTS: A new and highly stable circRNA was found, which was derived from the reverse splicing of GSK3beta exon 1 to exon 7, and hsa_circ_0121582 was down-regulated in leukemia cells. In gain-of-function experiments, the up-regulated hsa_circ_0121582 inhibited the proliferation of leukemia cells in vitro and in vivo. In the cytoplasm, hsa_circ_0121582 could act as a sponge for miR-224, attenuate the inhibiting effect of miR-224 on GSK3beta, and thus up-regulate the expression level of GSK3beta. In addition, hsa_circ_0121582 could bind to GSK3beta promoter in the nucleus, and recruit DNA demethylase TET1 to ensuring the transcription of GSK3beta. The upregulated GSK3beta inhibited the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway, and reduced the aggregation of beta-catenin in the nucleus, thus inhibited the proliferation of leukemia cells. CONCLUSIONS: This study found that hsa_circ_0121582 was involved in the inhibition of tumor proliferation, and the restoration of hsa_circ_0121582 could be an effective treatment strategy for patients with leukemia.","['Chen, J-J', 'Lei, P', 'Zhou, M']","['Chen JJ', 'Lei P', 'Zhou M']","[""Department of Hematology, Hunan Provincial People's Hospital, The First-Affiliated Hospital of Hunan Normal University, Jiefang West Road 61, Changsha, 410002, Hunan, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Hunan Provincial People's Hospital, The First-Affiliated Hospital of Hunan Normal University, Jiefang West Road 61, Changsha, 410002, Hunan, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Hunan Provincial People's Hospital, The First-Affiliated Hospital of Hunan Normal University, Jiefang West Road 61, Changsha, 410002, Hunan, China. hnchouming@163.com.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200529,Italy,Clin Transl Oncol,Clinical & translational oncology : official publication of the Federation of Spanish Oncology Societies and of the National Cancer Institute of Mexico,101247119,"['0 (MIRN224 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (RNA, Circular)', '0 (beta Catenin)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Proliferation/genetics', 'Down-Regulation', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta/genetics/*metabolism', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'MicroRNAs/*metabolism', 'RNA Splicing', 'RNA, Circular/*genetics/isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Transfection/methods', 'Up-Regulation', '*Wnt Signaling Pathway', 'beta Catenin/*metabolism']",,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'GSK3beta', 'TET1', 'hsa_circ_0121582', 'miR-224']",2020/05/31 06:00,2021/07/13 06:00,['2020/05/31 06:00'],"['2020/03/05 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/13 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/31 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12094-020-02377-9 [doi]', '10.1007/s12094-020-02377-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Clin Transl Oncol. 2020 Dec;22(12):2293-2302. doi: 10.1007/s12094-020-02377-9.

Previous studies have shown that AML is associated with cytogenetic heterogeneity, complex subtypes, and different therapeutic approaches. In this study, we found that miR-486 was upregulated in AML using both The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database and patient tissues. After knockdown of miR-486 by short hairpin RNA (shRNA), we discovered that miR-486 was required for cell proliferation. Through miRNA profile analysis and a dual-luciferase reporter assay, suppressor of cytokine signaling 2 (SOCS2) was identified as a direct target of miR-486. Therefore, by silencing SOCS2, a negative regulator of the Janus kinase (JAK)-signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway, miR-486 enhanced JAK-STAT3 activity and promoted cell proliferation. The miR-486-SOCS2-STAT3 proliferation axis is therefore involved in the pathogenesis of AML, providing a novel molecular mechanism and diagnostic and therapeutic clues for AML.","['Sha, Cao', 'Jia, Gao', 'Jingjing, Zhao', 'Yapeng, Hu', 'Zhi, Lou', 'Guanghui, Xu']","['Sha C', 'Jia G', 'Jingjing Z', 'Yapeng H', 'Zhi L', 'Guanghui X']","[""Department of Oncology, The First People's Hospital of Lianyungang, No. 6 Zhenhua Earth Road, Lianyungang City, 222061, Jiangsu Province, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Oncology, The First People's Hospital of Lianyungang, No. 6 Zhenhua Earth Road, Lianyungang City, 222061, Jiangsu Province, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Oncology, The First People's Hospital of Lianyungang, No. 6 Zhenhua Earth Road, Lianyungang City, 222061, Jiangsu Province, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Oncology, The First People's Hospital of Lianyungang, No. 6 Zhenhua Earth Road, Lianyungang City, 222061, Jiangsu Province, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Oncology, The First People's Hospital of Lianyungang, No. 6 Zhenhua Earth Road, Lianyungang City, 222061, Jiangsu Province, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Oncology, The First People's Hospital of Lianyungang, No. 6 Zhenhua Earth Road, Lianyungang City, 222061, Jiangsu Province, People's Republic of China. ddueveryday@163.com.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200529,Germany,Naunyn Schmiedebergs Arch Pharmacol,Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's archives of pharmacology,0326264,"['0 (MIRN486 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (SOCS2 protein, human)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinases)']",IM,"['Cell Proliferation', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinases/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', '*MicroRNAs', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/*genetics', 'Signal Transduction', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins/*genetics', 'Up-Regulation']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myeloid leukemia', '*JAK-STAT', '*Proliferation', '*SOCS2', '*miR-486']",2020/05/31 06:00,2021/10/21 06:00,['2020/05/31 06:00'],"['2019/12/13 00:00 [received]', '2020/04/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/21 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/31 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00210-020-01892-4 [doi]', '10.1007/s00210-020-01892-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Naunyn Schmiedebergs Arch Pharmacol. 2021 Jan;394(1):177-187. doi: 10.1007/s00210-020-01892-4.

BM fibrosis was previously thought to be a reactive phenomenon induced by mesenchymal stromal cells that are stimulated by the overproduction of cytokines such as transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1. However, the involvement of neoplastic fibrocytes in BM fibrosis was recently reported. In this study, we showed that the vast majority of collagen- and fibronectin-producing cells in the BM and spleens of Jak2V617F-induced myelofibrosis (MF) mice were fibrocytes derived from neoplastic hematopoietic cells. Neoplastic monocyte depletion eliminated collagen- and fibronectin-producing fibrocytes in BM and spleen, and ameliorated most characteristic MF features in Jak2V617F transgenic mice, including BM fibrosis, anemia, and splenomegaly, while had little effect on the elevated numbers of megakaryocytes and stem cells in BM, and leukothrombocytosis in peripheral blood. TGF-beta1, which was produced by hematopoietic cells including fibrocytes, promoted the differentiation of neoplastic monocytes to fibrocytes, and elevated plasma TGF-beta1 levels were normalized by monocyte depletion. Collectively, our data suggest that neoplastic fibrocytes are the major contributor to BM fibrosis in PMF, and TGF-beta1 is required for their differentiation.","['Ozono, Yoshinori', 'Shide, Kotaro', 'Kameda, Takuro', 'Kamiunten, Ayako', 'Tahira, Yuki', 'Sekine, Masaaki', 'Akizuki, Keiichi', 'Nakamura, Kenichi', 'Iwakiri, Hisayoshi', 'Sueta, Mitsue', 'Hidaka, Tomonori', 'Kubuki, Yoko', 'Yamamoto, Shojiro', 'Hasuike, Satoru', 'Sawaguchi, Akira', 'Nagata, Kenji', 'Shimoda, Kazuya']","['Ozono Y', 'Shide K', 'Kameda T', 'Kamiunten A', 'Tahira Y', 'Sekine M', 'Akizuki K', 'Nakamura K', 'Iwakiri H', 'Sueta M', 'Hidaka T', 'Kubuki Y', 'Yamamoto S', 'Hasuike S', 'Sawaguchi A', 'Nagata K', 'Shimoda K']","['Department of Gastroenterology and Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan.', 'Department of Gastroenterology and Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan.', 'Department of Gastroenterology and Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan.', 'Department of Gastroenterology and Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan.', 'Department of Gastroenterology and Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan.', 'Department of Gastroenterology and Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan.', 'Department of Gastroenterology and Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan.', 'Department of Gastroenterology and Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan.', 'Department of Gastroenterology and Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan.', 'Department of Gastroenterology and Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan.', 'Department of Gastroenterology and Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan.', 'Department of Gastroenterology and Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan.', 'Department of Gastroenterology and Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan.', 'Department of Gastroenterology and Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan.', 'Department of Anatomy, Ultrastructural Cell Biology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan.', 'Department of Gastroenterology and Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan.', 'Department of Gastroenterology and Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan. kshimoda@med.miyazaki-u.ac.jp.']",['eng'],"['19K17404/MEXT | Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)', '19K08819/MEXT | Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)', '19K17834/MEXT | Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)', '17H04210/MEXT | Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200529,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Tgfb1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta1)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Jak2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Fibroblasts/metabolism/*pathology', 'Janus Kinase 2/genetics/*metabolism', 'Megakaryocytes/metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', '*Mutation', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Splenomegaly', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta1/genetics/metabolism']",PMC7862060,,,2020/05/31 06:00,2021/02/26 06:00,['2020/05/31 06:00'],"['2020/01/30 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/07 00:00 [revised]', '2020/05/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/26 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/31 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-020-0880-3 [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-020-0880-3 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2021 Feb;35(2):454-467. doi: 10.1038/s41375-020-0880-3.

A high correlation was found at levels of disease above MR4, but there was a poor correlation for samples during DMR. A combination of DNA and RNA MRD measurements resulted in a better prediction of molecular relapse-free survival (MRFS) after TKI stop (n = 17) or scheduled interruption (n = 25). At 18 months after treatment cessation, patients with stopped or interrupted TKI therapy who were DNA negative/RNA negative during DMR maintenance (green group) had an MRFS of 80% and 100%, respectively, compared with those who were DNA positive/RNA negative (MRFS = 57% and 67%, respectively; yellow group) or DNA positive/RNA positive (MRFS = 20% for both cohorts; red group). Thus, we propose a ""traffic light"" stratification as a TFR predictor based on DNA and mRNA BCR-ABL1 measurements during DMR maintenance before TKI cessation.","['Machova Polakova, Katerina', 'Zizkova, Hana', 'Zuna, Jan', 'Motlova, Eliska', 'Hovorkova, Lenka', 'Gottschalk, Andrea', 'Glauche, Ingmar', 'Koblihova, Jitka', 'Pecherkova, Pavla', 'Klamova, Hana', 'Stastna Markova, Marketa', 'Srbova, Dana', 'Benesova, Adela', 'Polivkova, Vaclava', 'Jurcek, Tomas', 'Zackova, Daniela', 'Mayer, Jiri', 'Ernst, Thomas', 'Mahon, Francois X', 'Saussele, Susanne', 'Roeder, Ingo', 'Cross, Nicholas C P', 'Hochhaus, Andreas']","['Machova Polakova K', 'Zizkova H', 'Zuna J', 'Motlova E', 'Hovorkova L', 'Gottschalk A', 'Glauche I', 'Koblihova J', 'Pecherkova P', 'Klamova H', 'Stastna Markova M', 'Srbova D', 'Benesova A', 'Polivkova V', 'Jurcek T', 'Zackova D', 'Mayer J', 'Ernst T', 'Mahon FX', 'Saussele S', 'Roeder I', 'Cross NCP', 'Hochhaus A']","['Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, Prague, Czech Republic. katerina.machova@uhkt.cz.', 'Institute of Pathological Physiology, First Faculty of Medicine, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic. katerina.machova@uhkt.cz.', 'Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'CLIP, Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, Second Faculty of Medicine, Charles University and University Hospital Motol, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'CLIP, Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, Second Faculty of Medicine, Charles University and University Hospital Motol, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Institute for Medical Informatics and Biometry (IMB), Carl Gustav Carus Faculty of Medicine, TU Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'Institute for Medical Informatics and Biometry (IMB), Carl Gustav Carus Faculty of Medicine, TU Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Clinical and Experimental Hematology, First Faculty of Medicine, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Clinical and Experimental Hematology, First Faculty of Medicine, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Center of Molecular Biology and Gene Therapy, Internal Hematology and Oncology Clinic, Faculty Hospital Brno and Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Internal Hematology and Oncology Clinic, Faculty Hospital Brno and Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Internal Hematology and Oncology Clinic, Faculty Hospital Brno and Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Abteilung Hamatologie/Onkologie, Klinik fur Innere Medizin II, University of Jena, Jena, Germany.', 'BERGONIE Institute BORDEAUX, INSERM U1218 University of Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France.', 'Department of Haematology and Oncology, University Hospital Mannheim, Heidelberg University, Mannheim, Germany.', 'Institute for Medical Informatics and Biometry (IMB), Carl Gustav Carus Faculty of Medicine, TU Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'National Center for Tumor Diseases (NCT), Partner Site Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'Wessex Regional Genetics Laboratory, Salisbury NHS Foundation Trust, Salisbury and Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK.', 'Abteilung Hamatologie/Onkologie, Klinik fur Innere Medizin II, University of Jena, Jena, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200529,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (BCR-ABL1 fusion protein, human)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Remission Induction', 'Withholding Treatment']",,,,2020/05/31 06:00,2020/11/04 06:00,['2020/05/31 06:00'],"['2020/01/06 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/14 00:00 [revised]', '2020/05/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/04 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/31 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-020-0882-1 [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-020-0882-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2020 Aug;34(8):2113-2124. doi: 10.1038/s41375-020-0882-1.

Even among individuals with favorable-risk disease, approximately half will relapse with conventional therapy. In this clinical circumstance, the determinants of relapse are unclear, and there are no therapeutic interventions that can prevent recurrent disease. Mutations in the transcription factor CEBPA are associated with favorable risk in AML. However, mutations in the growth factor receptor CSF3R are commonly co-occurrent in CEBPA mutant AML and are associated with an increased risk of relapse. To develop therapeutic strategies for this disease subset, we performed medium-throughput drug screening on CEBPA/CSF3R mutant leukemia cells and identified sensitivity to inhibitors of lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1). Treatment of CSF3R/CEBPA mutant leukemia cells with LSD1 inhibitors reactivates differentiation-associated enhancers driving immunophenotypic and morphologic differentiation. LSD1 inhibition is ineffective as monotherapy but demonstrates synergy with inhibitors of JAK/STAT signaling, doubling median survival in vivo. These results demonstrate that combined inhibition of JAK/STAT signaling and LSD1 is a promising therapeutic strategy for CEBPA/CSF3R mutant AML.","['Braun, Theodore P', 'Coblentz, Cody', 'Smith, Brittany M', 'Coleman, Daniel J', 'Schonrock, Zachary', 'Carratt, Sarah A', 'Callahan, Rowan L', 'Maniaci, Breanna', 'Druker, Brian J', 'Maxson, Julia E']","['Braun TP', 'Coblentz C', 'Smith BM', 'Coleman DJ', 'Schonrock Z', 'Carratt SA', 'Callahan RL', 'Maniaci B', 'Druker BJ', 'Maxson JE']","['Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR 97239.', 'Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR 97239.', 'Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR 97239.', 'Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR 97239.', 'Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR 97239.', 'Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR 97239.', 'Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR 97239.', 'Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR 97239.', 'Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR 97239.', 'Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR 97239; drukerb@ohsu.edu maxsonj@ohsu.edu.', 'Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR 97239.', 'Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR 97239; drukerb@ohsu.edu maxsonj@ohsu.edu.', 'Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR 97239.']",['eng'],"['K08 CA245224/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'KL2 TR002370/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'U54 CA224019/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HHMI/Howard Hughes Medical Institute/United States', 'U01 CA217862/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R00 CA190605/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200529,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins)', '0 (CEBPA protein, mouse)', '0 (Csf3r protein, mouse)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Receptors, Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '0 (STAT Transcription Factors)', 'EC 1.14.11.- (Histone Demethylases)', 'EC 1.14.11.- (KDM1a protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Histone Demethylases/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Receptors, Colony-Stimulating Factor/*genetics/metabolism', 'STAT Transcription Factors/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects']",PMC7306806,['NOTNLM'],"['*CSF3R', '*LSD1', '*acute myeloid leukemia', '*epigenetics', '*targeted']",2020/05/31 06:00,2020/09/15 06:00,['2020/05/31 06:00'],"['2020/05/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/15 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/31 06:00 [entrez]']","['1918307117 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1918307117 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2020 Jun 16;117(24):13670-13679. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1918307117.

A viral gene, HTLV-1 bZIP factor (HBZ), induces pathogenic Foxp3-expressing T cells and triggers systemic inflammation and T cell lymphoma in transgenic mice, indicating its significance in HTLV-1-associated diseases. Here we show that, unexpectedly, a proinflammatory cytokine, IL-6, counteracts HBZ-mediated pathogenesis. Loss of IL-6 accelerates inflammation and lymphomagenesis in HBZ transgenic mice. IL-6 innately inhibits regulatory T cell differentiation, suggesting that IL-6 functions as a suppressor against HBZ-associated complications. HBZ up-regulates expression of the immunosuppressive cytokine IL-10. IL-10 promotes T cell proliferation only in the presence of HBZ. As a mechanism of growth promotion by IL-10, HBZ interacts with STAT1 and STAT3 and modulates the IL-10/JAK/STAT signaling pathway. These findings suggest that HTLV-1 promotes the proliferation of infected T cells by hijacking the machinery of regulatory T cell differentiation. IL-10 induced by HBZ likely suppresses the host immune response and concurrently promotes the proliferation of HTLV-1 infected T cells.","['Higuchi, Yusuke', 'Yasunaga, Jun-Ichirou', 'Mitagami, Yu', 'Tsukamoto, Hirotake', 'Nakashima, Kazutaka', 'Ohshima, Koichi', 'Matsuoka, Masao']","['Higuchi Y', 'Yasunaga JI', 'Mitagami Y', 'Tsukamoto H', 'Nakashima K', 'Ohshima K', 'Matsuoka M']","['Laboratory of Virus Control, Institute for Frontier Life and Medical Sciences, Kyoto University, Kyoto 606-8501, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Rheumatology, and Infectious Disease, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Faculty of Life Sciences, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto 860-8555, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Virus Control, Institute for Frontier Life and Medical Sciences, Kyoto University, Kyoto 606-8501, Japan; jyasunag@kumamoto-u.ac.jp.', 'Department of Hematology, Rheumatology, and Infectious Disease, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Faculty of Life Sciences, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto 860-8555, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Virus Control, Institute for Frontier Life and Medical Sciences, Kyoto University, Kyoto 606-8501, Japan.', 'Department of Immunology, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Faculty of Life Sciences, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto 860-8555, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, Kurume University, Kurume, Fukuoka 830-0011, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, Kurume University, Kurume, Fukuoka 830-0011, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Virus Control, Institute for Frontier Life and Medical Sciences, Kyoto University, Kyoto 606-8501, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Rheumatology, and Infectious Disease, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Faculty of Life Sciences, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto 860-8555, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200529,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (HBZ protein, human T-cell leukemia virus type I)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors/genetics/*immunology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Proliferation', 'HTLV-I Infections/genetics/*immunology/pathology/virology', 'Host-Pathogen Interactions', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/*immunology/physiology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-10/genetics/immunology', 'Interleukin-6/genetics/*immunology', 'Lymphoma/genetics/immunology/pathology/*virology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Retroviridae Proteins/genetics/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/immunology']",PMC7306771,['NOTNLM'],"['*HBZ', '*HTLV-1', '*IL-10', '*IL-6', '*JAK/STAT signaling pathway']",2020/05/31 06:00,2020/09/15 06:00,['2020/05/31 06:00'],"['2020/05/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/15 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/31 06:00 [entrez]']","['1922884117 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1922884117 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2020 Jun 16;117(24):13740-13749. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1922884117.

METHODS: Cumulative styrene exposure was estimated from work assignments and air-sampling data. Exposure-response relationships between styrene and select cancers were examined in Cox proportional hazards models matched on attained age, sex, race, birth cohort and employment duration. Models adjusted for socioeconomic status (SES). Exposures were lagged 10 years or by a period maximising the likelihood. HRs included 95% profile-likelihood CIs. Actuarial methods were used to estimate the styrene exposure corresponding to 10(-4) extra lifetime risk. RESULTS: The cohort (n= 5163) contributed 201 951 person-years. Exposures were right-skewed, with mean and median of 31 and 5.7 ppm-years, respectively. Positive, monotonic exposure-response associations were evident for leukaemia (HR at 50 ppm-years styrene = 1.46; 95% CI 1.04 to 1.97) and bladder cancer (HR at 50 ppm-years styrene =1.64; 95% CI 1.14 to 2.33). There was no evidence of confounding by SES. A working lifetime exposure to 0.05 ppm styrene corresponded to one extra leukaemia death per 10 000 workers. CONCLUSIONS: The study contributes evidence of exposure-response associations between cumulative styrene exposure and cancer. Simple risk projections at current exposure levels indicate a need for formal risk assessment. Future recommendations on worker protection would benefit from additional research clarifying cancer risks from styrene exposure.","['Daniels, Robert Douglas', 'Bertke, Stephen J']","['Daniels RD', 'Bertke SJ']","['Division of Science Integration, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, Cincinnati, Ohio, USA rtd2@cdc.gov.', 'Division of Field Studies and Engineering, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, Cincinnati, Ohio, USA.']",['eng'],['CC999999/ImCDC/Intramural CDC HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200529,England,Occup Environ Med,Occupational and environmental medicine,9422759,['44LJ2U959V (Styrene)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Cohort Studies', 'Construction Materials/adverse effects/statistics & numerical data', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/epidemiology/*mortality', 'Occupational Exposure/*adverse effects/statistics & numerical data', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Risk Factors', 'Ships/*statistics & numerical data', 'Social Class', 'Styrene/*adverse effects', 'Washington/epidemiology', 'Workplace/standards/statistics & numerical data']",PMC7494518,['NOTNLM'],"['*cancer', '*epidemiology', '*occupational health practice', '*retrospective exposure assessment', '*risk assessment']",2020/05/31 06:00,2020/11/25 06:00,['2020/05/31 06:00'],"['2020/01/24 00:00 [received]', '2020/04/29 00:00 [revised]', '2020/05/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/25 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/31 06:00 [entrez]']","['oemed-2020-106445 [pii]', '10.1136/oemed-2020-106445 [doi]']",ppublish,Occup Environ Med. 2020 Oct;77(10):706-712. doi: 10.1136/oemed-2020-106445.

Moreover, even successful cases often face long-term treatment-associated toxicities. Targeted therapeutics may overcome these limitations. We have previously demonstrated that casein kinase 2 (CK2)-mediated phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) posttranslational inactivation, and consequent phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling hyperactivation, leads to increased T-ALL cell survival and proliferation. We also revealed the existence of a crosstalk between CK2 activity and the signaling mediated by interleukin 7 (IL-7), a critical leukemia-supportive cytokine. Here, we evaluated the impact of CIGB-300, a the clinical-grade peptide-based CK2 inhibitor CIGB-300 on T-ALL biology. We demonstrate that CIGB-300 decreases the viability and proliferation of T-ALL cell lines and diagnostic patient samples. Moreover, CIGB-300 overcomes IL-7-mediated T-ALL cell growth and viability, while preventing the positive effects of OP9-delta-like 1 (DL1) stromal support on leukemia cells. Signaling and pull-down experiments indicate that the CK2 substrate nucleophosmin 1 (B23/NPM1) and CK2 itself are the molecular targets for CIGB-300 in T-ALL cells. However, B23/NPM1 silencing only partially recapitulates the anti-leukemia effects of the peptide, suggesting that CIGB-300-mediated direct binding to CK2, and consequent CK2 inactivation, is the mechanism by which CIGB-300 downregulates PTEN S380 phosphorylation and inhibits PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. In the context of IL-7 stimulation, CIGB-300 blocks janus kinase / signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) signaling pathway in T-ALL cells. Altogether, our results strengthen the case for anti-CK2 therapeutic intervention in T-ALL, demonstrating that CIGB-300 (given its ability to circumvent the effects of pro-leukemic microenvironmental cues) may be a valid tool for clinical intervention in this aggressive malignancy.","['Perera, Yasser', 'Melao, Alice', 'Ramon, Ailyn C', 'Vazquez, Dania', 'Ribeiro, Daniel', 'Perea, Silvio E', 'Barata, Joao T']","['Perera Y', 'Melao A', 'Ramon AC', 'Vazquez D', 'Ribeiro D', 'Perea SE', 'Barata JT']","['Laboratory of Molecular Oncology, Center for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, Havana 10600, Cuba.', 'Instituto de Medicina Molecular Joao Lobo Antunes, Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade de Lisboa, 1649-028 Lisbon, Portugal.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Oncology, Center for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, Havana 10600, Cuba.', 'Pharmacogenomics Department, Center for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, Havana 10600, Cuba.', 'Instituto de Medicina Molecular Joao Lobo Antunes, Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade de Lisboa, 1649-028 Lisbon, Portugal.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Oncology, Center for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, Havana 10600, Cuba.', 'Instituto de Medicina Molecular Joao Lobo Antunes, Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade de Lisboa, 1649-028 Lisbon, Portugal.']",['eng'],"['CoG-648455/H2020 European Research Council', 'FAPESP/20015/2014/Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia', 'PTDC/MEC-HEM/31588/2017/Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia']",['Journal Article'],20200527,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,,,PMC7352628,['NOTNLM'],"['CIGB-300', 'Casein kinase 2 (CK2)', 'IL-7 receptor (IL-7R)', 'IL-7-mediated signaling', 'Signaling therapies.', 'Stromal support', 'T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL)']",2020/05/31 06:00,2020/05/31 06:01,['2020/05/31 06:00'],"['2020/04/28 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/18 00:00 [revised]', '2020/05/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/05/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/31 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers12061377 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers12061377 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2020 May 27;12(6). pii: cancers12061377. doi: 10.3390/cancers12061377.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because of the rare onset of SCN, its epidemiology, prognosis, and clinical manifestations have not yet been fully understood. In particular, large-cohort studies in Asian countries are still insufficient. Therefore, in this study, national health insurance data was used to investigate the epidemiologic features and prognosis of SCN in South Korea. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The data from the Health Insurance Review and Assessment database recorded between 1 January 2011 and 31 December 2015 were explored. SCN was defined based on the ICD-10 code, registry of benefit extension policy, and inclusion criteria of the study. After identifying patients with SCN, annual incidence and their co-morbidities were analyzed. RESULTS: Among the initially identified patients with severe neutropenia (N = 2145), a total of 367 patients had SCN and were enrolled. The annual incidence rate of SCN ranged from 0.12 to 0.17 per 100,000 person-year (PY) during the study period. The highest incidence was observed in pediatric patients aged between 0 to 9 years (N = 156), followed by women in their fifties (N = 43). The total incidence rate was 0.17 in females and 0.12 in males (Relative risk (RR): 1.43, 95%, CI: 1.16-1.76). The most common accompanying condition was mild respiratory infection, but about 3.2% of patients progressed to hematologic malignancy after an average of 2.4 years. CONCLUSIONS: This nationwide population-based epidemiological study showed that incidence of SCN is higher in pediatrics and middle-aged women. As progression to hematologic malignancy was significantly higher in the age of in 45-49 year olds, careful follow-up is necessary in this group. However, since this study lacks the molecular information, these finding need to be interpreted with great caution.","['Lee, Nuri', 'Lee, Boung Chul']","['Lee N', 'Lee BC']","['Department of Laboratory of Medicine, Kangnam Sacred Heart Hospital, Hallym University, College of Medicine, Seoul 07441, Korea.', 'Department of Psychiatry, Hangang Sacred Heart Hospital, Hallym University College of Medicine, Seoul 07247, Korea.', 'Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service, Seoul 07247, Korea.']",['eng'],['HURF-2015-51/Hallym University Research Fund'],['Journal Article'],20200527,Switzerland,Medicina (Kaunas),"Medicina (Kaunas, Lithuania)",9425208,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Chi-Square Distribution', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Incidence', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/blood/complications/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'National Health Programs/statistics & numerical data', 'Neutropenia/epidemiology/*etiology/physiopathology', 'Republic of Korea/epidemiology', 'Respiratory Tract Infections/complications/epidemiology/physiopathology']",PMC7353846,['NOTNLM'],"['epidemiology', 'incidence', 'leukemia', 'myelodysplastic syndromes', 'neutropenia', 'severe chronic']",2020/05/31 06:00,2021/02/04 06:00,['2020/05/31 06:00'],"['2020/04/29 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/20 00:00 [revised]', '2020/05/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/05/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/04 06:00 [medline]']","['medicina56060262 [pii]', '10.3390/medicina56060262 [doi]']",epublish,Medicina (Kaunas). 2020 May 27;56(6). pii: medicina56060262. doi: 10.3390/medicina56060262.,,"['The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.

Here we will discuss the state of the art of the transposon-based gene transfer and its application in CAR T immunotherapy, specifically focusing on the Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposon system, as a valid cost-effective and safe option as compared to the viral vector-based systems. A general overview of SB transposon system applications will be provided, with an update of major developments, current clinical trials achievements and future perspectives exploiting SB for CAR T-cell engineering. After the first clinical successes achieved in the context of B-cell neoplasms, we are now facing a new era and it is paramount to advance gene transfer technology to fully exploit the potential of CAR T-cells towards next-generation immunotherapy.","['Magnani, Chiara F', 'Tettamanti, Sarah', 'Alberti, Gaia', 'Pisani, Ilaria', 'Biondi, Andrea', 'Serafini, Marta', 'Gaipa, Giuseppe']","['Magnani CF', 'Tettamanti S', 'Alberti G', 'Pisani I', 'Biondi A', 'Serafini M', 'Gaipa G']","['Centro Ricerca M.

It is also known as a cluster of differentiation 274 (CD274) or B7 homolog 1 (B7-H1). Suppressing the adaptive arm of the immune system is the critical role of PD-L1.so it prohibits the proliferation of activated T cells and reduces apoptosis in regulatory T cells. When PD-L1 binds to PD-1, it prevents T cells from killing other cells such as cancer cells. Viruses have various strategies to evade from the immune system such as modifying host gene expression or deregulating proteins function. So they can directly or indirectly change the expression of PD-L1. This study proposed to evaluate the effect of viruses on the expression of PD-L1 which leading to uncontrolled cell growth and tumor formation. We have studied serious tumorigenic viruses, including Human Papillomaviruses (HPV), Epstein-Barr viruses (EBV), Human T-cell leukemia viruses type 1 (HTLV-1), Hepatitis B viruses (HBV) and Hepatitis C viruses (HCV). So we surveyed the correlation between the presence of viruses and expression of PD-L1. Most studies showed the PD-L1 overexpression due to viral functions; however, further studies are needed to better understand the role of the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway in virus-associated cancers as a candidate of anti- PD-L1 therapy.","['Golrokh Mofrad, Morvarid', 'Taghizadeh Maleki, Donya', 'Faghihloo, Ebrahim']","['Golrokh Mofrad M', 'Taghizadeh Maleki D', 'Faghihloo E']","['Human Viral Vaccine Department, Razi Vaccine & Serum Research Institute, Agricultural Research, Education & Extension Organization (AREEO), Karaj, Iran.', 'Department of Microbiology, School of Medicine, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Microbiology, School of Medicine, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.

However, cardiotoxicity associated with these targeted therapies puts the cancer survivors at higher risk. Ponatinib is a third-generation TKI for the treatment of CML patients having gatekeeper mutation T315I, which is resistant to the first and second generation of TKIs, namely, imatinib, nilotinib, dasatinib, and bosutinib. Multiple unbiased screening from our lab and others have identified ponatinib as most cardiotoxic FDA approved TKI among the entire FDA approved TKI family (total 50+). Indeed, ponatinib is the only treatment option for CML patients with T315I mutation. This review focusses on the cardiovascular risks and mechanism/s associated with CML TKIs with a particular focus on ponatinib cardiotoxicity. We have summarized our recent findings with transgenic zebrafish line harboring BNP luciferase activity to demonstrate the cardiotoxic potential of ponatinib. Additionally, we will review the recent discoveries reported by our and other laboratories that ponatinib primarily exerts its cardiotoxicity via an off-target effect on cardiomyocyte prosurvival signaling pathways, AKT and ERK.

However, alloSCT using NMA conditioning had been rarely applied to beta-thalassemia major (beta-TM) patients. METHODS: To avoid prolonged immunosuppression, we developed a two-stage strategy. Mixed donor chimerism was initially achieved using the protocol developed by the NIH protocol. Thereafter, we facilitated donor chimerism using the optional reinforced stem cell (SC) infusion in cases requiring protracted immunosuppression or experiencing impending graft failure. RESULTS: In this study, beta-TM (n = 9) and SCD (n = 4) patients were equally effectively treated with eradicating the abnormal hemoglobin phenotype. Five patients, including four beta-TM, achieved stable mixed chimerism without receiving optional reinforced SC infusion. All patients that received optional reinforced infusion achieved complete (n = 4) or mixed chimerism (n = 1). The overall survival rate and event-free survival at 4 years were 91.7% (95% CI; 53.9-98.8) in both groups, with a thalassemia-free survival rate in beta-TM patients of 87.5% (95% CI; 38.7-98.1). CONCLUSION: This study is the first to report successful NMA conditioning alloSCT to achieve stable mixed chimerism correcting the abnormal hemoglobin phenotype in adult beta-TM patients.","['Shin, Seung-Hwan', 'Park, Sung-Soo', 'Park, Silvia', 'Jeon, Young-Woo', 'Yoon, Jae-Ho', 'Yahng, Seung-Ah', 'Cho, Byung-Sik', 'Kim, Yoo-Jin', 'Lee, Seok', 'Kim, Hee-Je', 'Min, Chang-Ki', 'Cho, Seok-Goo', 'Kim, Dong-Wook', 'Lee, Jong-Wook', 'Eom, Ki-Seong']","['Shin SH', 'Park SS', 'Park S', 'Jeon YW', 'Yoon JH', 'Yahng SA', 'Cho BS', 'Kim YJ', 'Lee S', 'Kim HJ', 'Min CK', 'Cho SG', 'Kim DW', 'Lee JW', 'Eom KS']","[""Department of Hematology, Hematology Institute, Eunpyeong St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea."", ""Leukemia Research Institute, Catholic Hematology Hospital, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea."", ""Leukemia Research Institute, Catholic Hematology Hospital, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea."", ""Department of Hematology, Yeouido St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea."", ""Leukemia Research Institute, Catholic Hematology Hospital, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea."", ""Department of Hematology, Incheon St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea."", ""Leukemia Research Institute, Catholic Hematology Hospital, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea."", ""Leukemia Research Institute, Catholic Hematology Hospital, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea."", ""Leukemia Research Institute, Catholic Hematology Hospital, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea."", ""Leukemia Research Institute, Catholic Hematology Hospital, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea."", ""Leukemia Research Institute, Catholic Hematology Hospital, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea."", ""Leukemia Research Institute, Catholic Hematology Hospital, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea."", ""Leukemia Research Institute, Catholic Hematology Hospital, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea."", ""Leukemia Research Institute, Catholic Hematology Hospital, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea."", ""Leukemia Research Institute, Catholic Hematology Hospital, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200710,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,,IM,"['*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/methods', 'Hemoglobinopathies/diagnosis/mortality/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Prognosis', '*Siblings', 'Transplantation Chimera', '*Transplantation Conditioning/adverse effects/methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'beta-Thalassemia/mortality/therapy']",,['NOTNLM'],"['non-myeloablative conditioning', 'sickle cell disease', 'beta-thalassemia major']",2020/05/30 06:00,2021/07/30 06:00,['2020/05/30 06:00'],"['2020/02/09 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/19 00:00 [revised]', '2020/05/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/30 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/30 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ejh.13455 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2020 Oct;105(4):387-398. doi: 10.1111/ejh.13455.

In both settings, cancer cures crucially depended on CD8(+) T cells and the AH1 peptide (derived from the gp70 protein of the murine leukemia virus) acted as the main tumor-rejection antigen, with approximately 50% of CD8(+) T cells in the neoplastic mass being AH1-specific after therapy. In order to characterize the clonality of the T cell response, its phenotype, and activation status, we isolated CD8(+) T cells from tumors and secondary lymphoid organs and submitted them to T cell receptor (TCR) and total mRNA sequencing. We found an extremely diverse repertoire of more than 40 000 unique TCR sequences, but the ten most abundant TCRs accounted for >60% of CD8(+) T-cell clones in the tumor. AH1-specific TCRs were consistently found among the most abundant sequences. AH1-specific T cells in the tumor had a tissue-resident memory phenotype. Treatment with L19-mIL12 led to overexpression of IL-12 receptor and of markers of cell activation and proliferation. These data suggest that the antitumor response driven by antibody-cytokine fusions proceeds through an oligoclonal expansion and activation of tumor-infiltrating CD8(+) T cells.","['Stringhini, Marco', 'Probst, Philipp', 'Neri, Dario']","['Stringhini M', 'Probst P', 'Neri D']","['Department of Chemistry and Applied Biosciences, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH Zurich), Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Department of Chemistry and Applied Biosciences, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH Zurich), Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Department of Chemistry and Applied Biosciences, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH Zurich), Zurich, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['670603/H2020 European Research Council/International', '310030_182003/1/Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Forderung der', 'Wissenschaftlichen Forschung/International']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200609,Germany,Eur J Immunol,European journal of immunology,1273201,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '187348-17-0 (Interleukin-12)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/immunology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Colon/*pathology', 'Colonic Neoplasms/immunology/*therapy', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Memory', 'Immunotherapy/*methods', 'Interleukin-12/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Peptides/genetics/immunology', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/genetics', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/genetics/immunology', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/genetics/immunology']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*T-cell receptor sequencing', '*immunotherapy', '*retroviral antigens', '*tumor immunology', '*tumor targeting']",2020/05/30 06:00,2021/01/12 06:00,['2020/05/30 06:00'],"['2019/10/08 00:00 [received]', '2020/04/19 00:00 [revised]', '2020/05/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/12 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/30 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/eji.201948433 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Immunol. 2020 Oct;50(10):1591-1597. doi: 10.1002/eji.201948433.

This research aimed to explore the regulatory effect of nicotinamide on glycolysis metabolism of leukemia cells and to clarify the associated mechanisms. MATERIAL AND METHODS HL-60 cells were treated with nicotinamide and divided into 0.1, 1, and 10 mumol/l groups. HL-60 cells without any administration were assigned as negative control (CT group). Glucolytic activity was evaluated by detecting lactic acid production, and glucose level was measured using glucose consumption assay. Apoptosis of HL-60 was examined using flow cytometry assay, when cells were cultured for 24 h. Expressions of sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1alpha (PGC-1alpha), and hypoxia-inducible factor-2alpha (HIF2alpha) were evaluated using a reverse transcription PCR assay and Western blotting assay, respectively. RESULTS Nicotinamide remarkably decreased lactic acid production and glucose levels in leukemia cells compared with that of the CT group (p<0.05). Nicotinamide significantly induced the apoptosis of HL-60 cells compared to that of the negative control group (p<0.05). Nicotinamide significantly inhibited the SIRT1/PGC-1alpha/HIF2alpha signaling pathway mRNAs compared to that of the CT group (p<0.05). Nicotinamide remarkably reduced mitochondrial regulatory factors SIRT1/PGC-1alpha expression compared to that in the CT group (p<0.05). Nicotinamide obviously downregulated HIF2alpha compared with that of the CT group (p<0.05). Moreover, all of the above nicotinamide-induced effects, including glycolytic activity, apoptosis, and expression of SIRT1/PGC-1alpha/HIF2alpha, were changed in a dose-dependent manner. CONCLUSIONS Nicotinamide can inhibit glycolysis of HL-60 cells by inhibiting the mitochondrial regulatory factor SIRT1/PGC-1alpha and suppressing transcription factor HIF2alpha.","['Liu, Miao', 'Zhou, Pan', 'Li, Jiaojiao', 'Jiang, Yi']","['Liu M', 'Zhou P', 'Li J', 'Jiang Y']","['Department of Pediatrics, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, China (mainland).', 'Hubei Medical Devices, Quality Supervision and Test Institute, Wuhan, Hubei, China (mainland).', 'Department of Pediatrics, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, China (mainland).', 'Department of Pediatrics, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, China (mainland).']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200529,United States,Med Sci Monit,Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research,9609063,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (PPAR gamma)', '0 (PPARGC1A protein, human)', '0 (Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor Gamma Coactivator 1-alpha)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '1B37H0967P (endothelial PAS domain-containing protein 1)', '25X51I8RD4 (Niacinamide)', 'EC 3.5.1.- (SIRT1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.1.- (Sirtuin 1)', 'EC 3.5.1.- (Sirtuins)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation/genetics', 'HL-60 Cells/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Hypoxia/metabolism', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Niacinamide/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'PPAR gamma/metabolism', 'Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor Gamma Coactivator 1-alpha/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Sirtuin 1/metabolism', 'Sirtuins/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism']",PMC7282349,,,2020/05/30 06:00,2021/02/17 06:00,['2020/05/30 06:00'],"['2020/05/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/05/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/17 06:00 [medline]']","['920810 [pii]', '10.12659/MSM.920810 [doi]']",epublish,Med Sci Monit. 2020 May 29;26:e920810. doi: 10.12659/MSM.920810.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our previous single-center study of decitabine followed by low dose idarubicin and cytarabine (D-IA) in patients with myeloid neoplasms showed promising primary results. We therefore conducted a multicenter study of D-IA regimen in AML evolving from MDS and higher-risk MDS. Patients with AML evolving from MDS or refractory anemia with excess blasts type 2 (RAEB-2) (based on the 2008 WHO classification) were included. The D-IA regimen (decitabine, 20 mg/m(2) daily, days 1 to 3; idarubicin, 6 mg/m(2) daily, days 4 to 6; cytarabine 25 mg/m(2) every 12 hours, days 4 to 8; granulocyte colony stimulating factor [G-CSF], 5 mug/kg, from day 4 until neutrophil count increased to 1.0 x 10(9) /L) was administered as induction chemotherapy. Seventy-one patients were enrolled and treated, among whom 44 (62.0%) had AML evolving from MDS and 27 (38.0%) had RAEB-2. Twenty-eight (63.6%) AML patients achieved complete remission (CR) or complete remission with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi): 14 (31.8%) patients had CR and 14 (31.8%) had CRi.

Our previous study has identified six novel changes in Nrf2/Keap1 pathway in pediatric ALL, which were described for the first time. These changes in the pathway are likely to alter the evolutionary process of amino acids and cause structural changes in the final products of genes. In this study, we aimed to compare the pathogenicity of eight determined mutations reported in our previous study by utilizing different programs with different algorithms and molecular dynamics simulation. Since it is too difficult to handle each existing mutation in a wet laboratory, in silico methods may give suggestion to choose the important mutations for further analysis and to establish the appropriate patient population and conduct wet laboratory studies. For this purpose, four different algorithms were used to evaluate the effects of single amino acid mutation. In addition, root-mean-square deviation, root-mean-square fluctuation and free-energy landscape analyses were performed to observe stability, flexibility and energetically favorable conformations, respectively, for each amino acid mutation. As a result, our study emphasizes the importance of Keap1 mutations in pediatric ALL Nrf2/Keap1 pathway, a total of eight mutations, two of which were shown for the first time in our study. Especially the mutations in the Keap1 Broad-Complex, Tramtrack and Bric-a-brac domain are worthy of attention.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

Our knowledge of genetic determinants of individual sensitivity to sucrose-driven metabolic effects is limited. In this study, we have tested the hypothesis that a variation of metabolic syndrome-related gene, Zbtb16 (Zinc Finger and BTB Domain Containing 16 will affect the reaction to high-sucrose diet (HSD) content in ""matched"" nutritional exposition settings, i.e. maternal HSD with re-exposition to HSD in adulthood vs. standard diet. We compared metabolic profiles of adult males of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and a single-gene, minimal congenic strain SHR-Zbtb16 fed either standard diet or exposed to HSD prenatally throughout gestation and nursing and again at the age of 6 months for the period of 14 days. HSD exposition led to increased adiposity in both strains and decrease of glucose tolerance and cholesterol (Ch) concentrations in majority of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particle classes and in very large and large high-density lipoprotein (HDL) in SHR-Zbtb16 male offspring. There was a similar pattern of HSD-induced increase of triacylglycerols in chylomicrons and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) of both strains, though the increase of (triacylglycerol) TAG content was clearly more pronounced in SHR. We observed significant STRAIN*DIET interactions for the smallest LDL particles as their TAG content decreased in SHR-Zbtb16 and did not change in SHR in response to HSD. In summary, we provide evidence of nutrigenetic interaction between Zbtb16 and HSD in context of pathogenesis of metabolic syndrome.","['Skolnikova, E', 'Sedova, L', 'Liska, F', 'Seda, O']","['Skolnikova E', 'Sedova L', 'Liska F', 'Seda O']","['Institute of Biology and Medical Genetics, First Faculty of Medicine, Charles University and General University Hospital, Prague, Czech Republic. oseda@lf1.cuni.cz.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200529,Czech Republic,Physiol Res,Physiological research,9112413,"['0 (Dietary Sucrose)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '0 (Sweetening Agents)', '0 (Triglycerides)', '0 (ZBTB16 protein, rat)', '97C5T2UQ7J (Cholesterol)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Congenic', 'Cholesterol/metabolism', 'Dietary Sucrose/*metabolism', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', 'Hypertension/genetics/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Metabolic Syndrome/etiology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Nutrigenomics/methods', 'Pregnancy', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred SHR', 'Sweetening Agents/metabolism', 'Triglycerides/*metabolism']",,,,2020/05/30 06:00,2021/06/04 06:00,['2020/05/30 06:00'],"['2020/05/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/04 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/30 06:00 [entrez]']","['934423 [pii]', '10.33549/physiolres.934423 [doi]']",ppublish,Physiol Res. 2020 Jul 16;69(3):521-527. doi: 10.33549/physiolres.934423.

The aim of this study was to identify the mechanism by which ethanol affects uric acid-induced NLR family pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activation by regulation of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Human myeloid leukemia cells (U937 cells) were used to assess the role of ethanol in NLRP3 inflammasome activation induced by monosodium urate (MSU) crystals. Expression of target molecules, such as NLRP3 inflammasome components, AhR, and TXNIP, were measured using quantitative real-time PCR and Western blot analyses. The effect of ethanol-induced TXNIP on the NLRP3 inflammasome was assessed in human macrophages transfected with TXNIP siRNA. RESULTS: U937 cells treated with 100 mM ethanol for 24 h induced NLRP3 and interleukin (IL)-1beta expression. Ethanol increased reactive oxygen species generation in a time- and dose-dependent manner. AhR mRNA expression was downregulated in U937 cells treated with 100 mM ethanol, whereas CYP1A1 mRNA expression increased. Treatment with ethanol increased NLRP3 and IL-1beta mRNA and protein expression in U937 cells exposed to 1.0 mg/mL of MSU crystals for 24 h. TXNIP expression in U937 cells incubated with both 100 mM ethanol and 1.0 mg/mL of MSU crystals was significantly higher than in cells incubated with MSU crystals alone. Treatment with 100mM ethanol for 24 h downregulated NLRP3 and IL-1beta expression in MSU crystal-activated U937 cells transfected with TXNIP siRNA, compared to those with scramble siRNA. CONCLUSION: Ethanol stimulates uric acid-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation through regression of AhR and upregulation of TXNIP.","['Kim, Seong Kyu', 'Choe, Jung Yoon', 'Park, Ki Yeun']","['Kim SK', 'Choe JY', 'Park KY']","['Division of Rheumatology, Department of Internal Medicine, Catholic University of Daegu School of Medicine, Daegu, Korea.', 'Arthritis and Autoimmunity Research Center, Catholic University of Daegu, Daegu, Korea. kimsk714@cu.ac.kr.', 'Division of Rheumatology, Department of Internal Medicine, Catholic University of Daegu School of Medicine, Daegu, Korea.', 'Arthritis and Autoimmunity Research Center, Catholic University of Daegu, Daegu, Korea.', 'Arthritis and Autoimmunity Research Center, Catholic University of Daegu, Daegu, Korea.']",['eng'],['YUHAN/Korea'],['Journal Article'],,Korea (South),Yonsei Med J,Yonsei medical journal,0414003,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (IL1B protein, human)', '0 (Inflammasomes)', '0 (Interleukin-1beta)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (NLR Family, Pyrin Domain-Containing 3 Protein)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon)', '0 (TXNIP protein, human)', '268B43MJ25 (Uric Acid)', '3K9958V90M (Ethanol)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Carrier Proteins/*metabolism', 'Ethanol/*toxicity', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Inflammasomes/*metabolism', 'Interleukin-1beta/genetics/metabolism', 'Lipopolysaccharides/pharmacology', 'Macrophages/drug effects/*metabolism', 'NLR Family, Pyrin Domain-Containing 3 Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon/*metabolism', 'U937 Cells', 'Uric Acid/*toxicity']",PMC7255999,['NOTNLM'],"['AhR', 'Ethanol', 'NLRP3', 'TXNIP', 'inflammasome', 'uric acid']",2020/05/30 06:00,2020/07/28 06:00,['2020/05/30 06:00'],"['2020/03/16 00:00 [received]', '2020/04/13 00:00 [revised]', '2020/04/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/05/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/28 06:00 [medline]']","['61.533 [pii]', '10.3349/ymj.2020.61.6.533 [doi]']",ppublish,Yonsei Med J. 2020 Jun;61(6):533-541. doi: 10.3349/ymj.2020.61.6.533.,"['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7780-0167', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0957-0395', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0837-3595']",['The authors have no potential conflicts of interest to disclose.'],['(c) Copyright: Yonsei University College of Medicine 2020.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Records of 78 patients who underwent HSCT with RIC consisting of 3.2 mg/kg/day of busulfan for 2 or 3 days and 30 mg/m(2)/day of fludarabine for 5 or 6 days were analyzed. RESULTS: The median age at diagnosis was 49 years. Over a median follow-up of 22 months, 2-year estimates of relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival were 57.4% and 68.7%, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed a trend of improved RFS in patients with chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) (hazard ratio, 0.53; 95% confidence interval, 0.26-1.08; p=0.080). The cumulative incidences of relapse and non-relapse mortality were 42.9% and 19.6%, respectively and one case of central nervous system relapse was noted. No hepatic veno-occlusive disease was reported. Grade II-IV acute GVHD and any grade chronic GVHD occurred in 21.1% and 41.7%, respectively.

Focused qualitative studies on a wider range of psychological distress in HSCT patients are lacking. However, understanding the subtleties of psychological distress (e.g. fear, guilt, loss of control) in HSCT patients is imperative to optimising the psychological well-being of this vulnerable population. To explore psychological distress after transplantation, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 25 HSCT patients. METHODS: Interviews were completed in the first 100 days after transplantation. Interview modules explored psychological distress symptoms in the hospital and during the first 100 days after HSCT, along with the perceived impact of these symptoms on their recovery. RESULTS: Of the negative emotional experiences reported, feeling trapped, fear, guilt, discouragement and powerlessness were frequently expressed. Patients reported that negative emotional states interfered with their motivation to participate in health behaviours important to the transplant recovery. CONCLUSION: As one of the few qualitative studies broadly characterising the nature of negative emotional experiences after HSCT, these findings add to our understanding of the specific psychological challenges in this growing patient population and can inform development of targeted interventions and overall management of psychological distress during HSCT recovery.","['Amonoo, Hermioni L', 'Brown, Lydia A', 'Scheu, Carlyn F', 'Harnedy, Lauren E', 'Pirl, William F', 'El-Jawahri, Areej', 'Huffman, Jeff C']","['Amonoo HL', 'Brown LA', 'Scheu CF', 'Harnedy LE', 'Pirl WF', 'El-Jawahri A', 'Huffman JC']","['Department of Psychosocial Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', ""Department of Psychiatry, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA."", 'Melbourne School of Psychological Sciences, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.', 'Department of Psychiatry, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Department of Psychiatry, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Department of Psychosocial Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Department of Psychiatry, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.']",['eng'],"['1-17-ICTS-099/American Diabetes Association', 'R21DK109313/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'Harvard Medical School', 'R21DK109313/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",['Journal Article'],20200529,England,Eur J Cancer Care (Engl),European journal of cancer care,9301979,,,"['Adult', 'Anxiety/*psychology', 'Depression/*psychology', '*Emotions', 'Fear/psychology', 'Female', 'Guilt', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*psychology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Motivation', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*therapy', '*Psychological Distress', 'Qualitative Research', 'Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic/*psychology']",,['NOTNLM'],"['cancer', 'hematopoietic stem cell transplant', 'negative emotional states', 'psychological', 'psychosocial oncology', 'quality of life']",2020/05/30 06:00,2021/08/26 06:00,['2020/05/30 06:00'],"['2019/08/06 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/09 00:00 [revised]', '2020/04/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/26 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/30 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ecc.13263 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Cancer Care (Engl). 2020 Sep;29(5):e13263. doi: 10.1111/ecc.13263.

However, the precise role of inflammation and whether local or systemic factors drive the neurogenic decline during aging is poorly understood. Here, we identify CXCR5/5/CXCL13 signaling as a novel regulator of neurogenesis in the aged brain. The chemokine Cxcl13 was found to be upregulated in the brain during aging. Loss of its receptor, Cxcr5, led to increased proliferation and decreased numbers of neuroblasts in the aged subventricular zone (SVZ), together with accumulation of neuroblasts in the rostral migratory stream and olfactory bulb (OB), without increasing the amount of new mature neurons in the OB. The effect on proliferation and migration was specific to neuroblasts and likely mediated through increased levels of systemic IL-6 and local Cxcl12 expression in the SVZ. Our study raises the possibility of a new mechanism by which interplay between systemic and local alterations in inflammation regulates neurogenesis during aging.","['Fritze, Jonas', 'Ginisty, Aurelie', 'McDonald, Rebecca', 'Quist, Ella', 'Stamp, Eleanor', 'Monni, Emanuela', 'Dhapola, Parashar', 'Lang, Stefan', 'Ahlenius, Henrik']","['Fritze J', 'Ginisty A', 'McDonald R', 'Quist E', 'Stamp E', 'Monni E', 'Dhapola P', 'Lang S', 'Ahlenius H']","['Faculty of Medicine, Department of Clinical Sciences and Neurology, Stem Cells, Aging and Neurodegeneration Group, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Lund Stem Cell Center, Lund, Sweden.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Department of Clinical Sciences and Neurology, Stem Cells, Aging and Neurodegeneration Group, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Lund Stem Cell Center, Lund, Sweden.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Department of Clinical Sciences and Neurology, Stem Cells, Aging and Neurodegeneration Group, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Lund Stem Cell Center, Lund, Sweden.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Department of Clinical Sciences and Neurology, Stem Cells, Aging and Neurodegeneration Group, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Lund Stem Cell Center, Lund, Sweden.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Department of Clinical Sciences and Neurology, Stem Cells, Aging and Neurodegeneration Group, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Lund Stem Cell Center, Lund, Sweden.', 'Lund Stem Cell Center, Lund, Sweden.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Department of Clinical Sciences and Neurology, Laboratory of Stem Cells and Restorative Neurology, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Lund Stem Cell Center, Lund, Sweden.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Division of Molecular Hematology, Stem Cells and Leukemia Group, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Lund Stem Cell Center, Lund, Sweden.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Division of Molecular Hematology, Computational Genomics Group, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Department of Clinical Sciences and Neurology, Stem Cells, Aging and Neurodegeneration Group, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Lund Stem Cell Center, Lund, Sweden.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200529,United States,Stem Cells,"Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)",9304532,"['0 (CXCR5 protein, mouse)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR5)']",IM,"['Aging/*physiology', 'Animals', 'Brain/*physiology', 'Cell Count', '*Cell Movement', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Female', 'Germ-Line Mutation/genetics', 'Lateral Ventricles/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Microglia/metabolism', 'Neurogenesis', 'Neurons/*cytology/metabolism', 'Olfactory Bulb/metabolism', 'Receptors, CXCR5/*metabolism']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Cxcl13', '*Cxcr5', '*aging', '*neuroblast', '*neurogenesis']",2020/05/30 06:00,2021/07/02 06:00,['2020/05/30 06:00'],"['2019/01/03 00:00 [received]', '2020/04/06 00:00 [revised]', '2020/04/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/02 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/30 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/stem.3207 [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cells. 2020 Sep;38(9):1175-1187. doi: 10.1002/stem.3207.

Nonetheless, cancer epidemiology in children with birth defects is not well characterized. METHODS: Using data from population-based registries in 4 US states, this study compared children with cancer but no birth defects (n = 13,111) with children with cancer and 1 or more nonsyndromic birth defects (n = 1616). The objective was to evaluate cancer diagnostic characteristics, including tumor type, age at diagnosis, and stage at diagnosis. RESULTS: Compared with the general population of children with cancer, children with birth defects were diagnosed with more embryonal tumors (26.6% vs 18.7%; q < 0.001), including neuroblastoma (12.5% vs 8.2%; q < 0.001) and hepatoblastoma (5.0% vs 1.3%; q < 0.001), but fewer hematologic malignancies, including acute lymphoblastic leukemia (12.4% vs 24.4%; q < 0.001). In age-stratified analyses, differences in tumor type were evident among children younger than 1 year and children 1 to 4 years old, but they were attenuated among children 5 years of age or older. The age at diagnosis was younger in children with birth defects for most cancers, including leukemia, lymphoma, astrocytoma, medulloblastoma, ependymoma, embryonal tumors, and germ cell tumors (all q < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate possible etiologic heterogeneity in children with birth defects, have implications for future surveillance efforts, and raise the possibility of differential cancer ascertainment in children with birth defects. LAY SUMMARY: Scientific studies suggest that children with birth defects are at increased risk for cancer. However, these studies have not been able to determine whether important tumor characteristics, such as the type of tumor diagnosed, the age at which the tumor is diagnosed, and the degree to which the tumor has spread at the time of diagnosis, are different for children with birth defects and children without birth defects. This study attempts to answer these important questions. By doing so, it may help scientists and physicians to understand the causes of cancer in children with birth defects and diagnose cancer at earlier stages when it is more treatable.","['Schraw, Jeremy M', 'Desrosiers, Tania A', 'Nembhard, Wendy N', 'Langlois, Peter H', 'Meyer, Robert E', 'Canfield, Mark A', 'Rasmussen, Sonja A', 'Chambers, Tiffany M', 'Spector, Logan G', 'Plon, Sharon E', 'Lupo, Philip J']","['Schraw JM', 'Desrosiers TA', 'Nembhard WN', 'Langlois PH', 'Meyer RE', 'Canfield MA', 'Rasmussen SA', 'Chambers TM', 'Spector LG', 'Plon SE', 'Lupo PJ']","['Department of Medicine, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas.', 'Center for Epidemiology and Population Health, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Epidemiology, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, North Carolina.', 'Department of Epidemiology, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, Arkansas.', 'Birth Defects Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch, Department of State Health Services, Austin, Texas.', 'Department of Maternal and Child Health, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, North Carolina.', 'State Center for Health Statistics, North Carolina Division of Public Health, Raleigh, North Carolina.', 'Birth Defects Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch, Department of State Health Services, Austin, Texas.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Florida College of Medicine, Gainesville, Florida.', 'Department of Epidemiology, University of Florida College of Medicine and College of Public Health and Health Professions, Gainesville, Florida.', 'Center for Epidemiology and Population Health, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Medicine, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas.', 'Center for Epidemiology and Population Health, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas.']",['eng'],"['P30 ES010126/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA125123/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'RP160097/Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas', ""Epidemiology Award/Alex's Lemonade Stand Foundation for Childhood Cancer"", 'RP170071/Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas', '3P30CA125123-0851/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'RP140258/Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200529,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Congenital Abnormalities/*diagnosis/epidemiology/pathology', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/complications/diagnosis/epidemiology/pathology', 'Hepatoblastoma/complications/diagnosis/epidemiology/pathology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Liver Neoplasms/complications/diagnosis/epidemiology/pathology', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/complications/*diagnosis/*epidemiology/pathology', 'Neuroblastoma/complications/diagnosis/epidemiology/pathology', 'Registries', 'Risk Factors', 'United States/epidemiology']",PMC8485389,['NOTNLM'],"['*birth defects', '*cancer predisposition', '*childhood cancer', '*epidemiology']",2020/05/30 06:00,2021/05/21 06:00,['2020/05/30 06:00'],"['2019/10/18 00:00 [received]', '2020/04/27 00:00 [revised]', '2020/05/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/21 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/30 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.32982 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2020 Aug 1;126(15):3483-3492. doi: 10.1002/cncr.32982.

Heart rate variability analysis can evaluate autonomic nervous function interactions with cardiac function. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to characterise heart rate variability differences between patients undergoing chemotherapy and controls, and the effects of haematopoietic stem cell transplantation on the autonomic nervous system in patients with haematological malignancies. METHODS: Nineteen patients (11 male, median age: 11.6 years) who received conventional chemotherapy followed by transplantation and 19 non-transplant patients (10 male, median age: 11.5 years) receiving chemotherapy only between 2006 and 2018 for haematological malignancies were retrospectively enrolled. Data from 24-hour Holter monitoring were recorded after chemotherapy and before and after transplantation. Heart rate variability was analysed in patients and 32 matched normal controls. RESULTS: There were significant differences between patients and normal controls in all heart rate variability analysis parameters apart from coefficient of variation of RR interval and standard deviation of the average normal RR interval for all 5-minute segments during sleeping. There was a significant difference in the cumulative anthracycline dose and heart rate variability during sleep between the non-transplant and pre-transplant groups. We observed no remarkable differences in time-domain analysis parameters between before and after transplantation, although the low-frequency component of power-spectrum analysis during awake hours was significantly decreased after transplantation. CONCLUSION: Conventional chemotherapy for paediatric haematologic diseases may be a risk factor for autonomic dysfunction. Further declines in heart rate variability after transplantation appear minor.","['Kobayashi, Honami', 'Motoki, Noriko', 'Yokota, Saori', 'Kanai, Ayako', 'Yamazaki, Shoko', 'Utsumi, Masafumi', 'Nakazawa, Yozo']","['Kobayashi H', 'Motoki N', 'Yokota S', 'Kanai A', 'Yamazaki S', 'Utsumi M', 'Nakazawa Y']","['Department of Pediatrics, Shinshu University School of Medicine, Asahi 3-1-1, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Shinshu University School of Medicine, Asahi 3-1-1, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Shinshu University School of Medicine, Asahi 3-1-1, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Shinshu University School of Medicine, Asahi 3-1-1, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Shinshu University School of Medicine, Asahi 3-1-1, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Shinshu University School of Medicine, Asahi 3-1-1, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Shinshu University School of Medicine, Asahi 3-1-1, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200529,England,Cardiol Young,Cardiology in the young,9200019,,IM,"['Autonomic Nervous System', 'Child', 'Heart Rate', '*Hematologic Neoplasms/therapy', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Retrospective Studies']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Heart rate variability', 'autonomic nervous system', 'haematopoietic stem cell transplantation', 'leukemia', 'lymphoma']",2020/05/30 06:00,2021/11/06 06:00,['2020/05/30 06:00'],"['2020/05/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/06 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/30 06:00 [entrez]']","['S1047951120001298 [pii]', '10.1017/S1047951120001298 [doi]']",ppublish,Cardiol Young. 2020 Jul;30(7):967-974. doi: 10.1017/S1047951120001298.

The aim of current study is to identify the common cytogenetic abnormalities in AML patients presenting at a tertiary care hospital of Pakistan. METHODS: It was a cross-sectional study conducted at the department of Medical oncology of the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Center, Karachi from Jun 2017- Jan 2019. The non-probability consecutive sampling technique was used to select patients. Total 92 cases of AML of age 15-55 years of either gender were included in the study. The detection of cytogenetic abnormality was done on the bone marrow biopsy. The cytogenetic abnormalities were classified into the three cytogenetic risk groups as favourable, intermediate and unfavourable. For analysis of data SPSS 23 version was used. RESULTS: The cytogenetic abnormalities were detected in 34 (37%) of the AML patients while 58 (63%) patients had normal cytogenetic. Thirty-two females (34.8%) had a normal cytogenetic (46; XX), and 15 females (16.3%) had various cytogenetic abnormalities. Twenty-six males (28.3%) had normal cytogenetic (46; XY) and 19 males (20.7%) had various cytogenetic abnormalities. Most of the patients were in intermediate risk group (67.4%), followed by favourable (17.4%) and unfavourable risk group (15.2%). The most frequent chromosomal abnormalities observed were complex cytogenetic which was detected in 5 AML patients. CONCLUSIONS: In the present study cytogenetic abnormalities were found in 37% of AML patients. Sixty-seven of the AML patients were in intermediate risk group and five patients had complex cytogenetic. Hence the cytogenetic analysis provides significant information regarding prognosis of AML patients and the cytogenetic abnormalities are less than international literature.","['Shaikh, Mehwish Roshan', 'Haider, Ghulam', 'Memon, Paras', 'Rahool, Raja', 'Nouman, Maryum', 'Beg, Shumaila', 'Meher, Khalil', 'Zahoor, Saima', 'Sami, Abdus', 'Pavan, Bhunisha']","['Shaikh MR', 'Haider G', 'Memon P', 'Rahool R', 'Nouman M', 'Beg S', 'Meher K', 'Zahoor S', 'Sami A', 'Pavan B']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Center, Karachi, Pakistan.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Center, Karachi, Pakistan.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Center, Karachi, Pakistan.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Center, Karachi, Pakistan.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Center, Karachi, Pakistan.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Center, Karachi, Pakistan.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Center, Karachi, Pakistan.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Center, Karachi, Pakistan.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Center, Karachi, Pakistan.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Center, Karachi, Pakistan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Pakistan,J Ayub Med Coll Abbottabad,"Journal of Ayub Medical College, Abbottabad : JAMC",8910750,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pakistan', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Factors', 'Young Adult']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukaemia', 'Cytogenetic abnormalities', 'Normal cytogenetic; Complex cytogenetic']",2020/05/30 06:00,2020/11/18 06:00,['2020/05/30 06:00'],"['2020/05/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/05/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/18 06:00 [medline]']",['7155/2856 [pii]'],ppublish,J Ayub Med Coll Abbottabad. 2020 Jan- Mar;32(1):33-37.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Haplo had improved overall survival (OS) when compared to MUD, HR 2.03 (P = 0.01) but not SIB, HR 1.17 (P = 0.61). There were no differences in relapse rates or treatment-related mortality (TRM). Haplo had higher rates of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) grade II-IV at day 180 than MUD (44% vs. 25%, P = 0.03) and SIB (44% vs. 13% P < 0.01). Rates of acute GVHD III-IV and chronic GVHD were similar among the groups.

Although patients receiving haplo had higher acute GVHD II-IV and slower engraftment, they did not have increased TRM. These data may suggest that patients receiving haplo have improved OS compared to MUD for AML patients receiving RIC transplants. This should be confirmed using a larger cohort.","['Rashid, Nahid', 'Slade, Michael', 'Abboud, Ramzi', 'Gao, Feng', 'DiPersio, John F', 'Westervelt, Peter', 'Uy, Geoffrey', 'Stockerl-Goldstein, Keith', 'Romee, Rizwan', 'Schroeder, Mark A']","['Rashid N', 'Slade M', 'Abboud R', 'Gao F', 'DiPersio JF', 'Westervelt P', 'Uy G', 'Stockerl-Goldstein K', 'Romee R', 'Schroeder MA']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Barnes Jewish Hospital/Washington University, Saint Louis, MO, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Barnes Jewish Hospital/Washington University, Saint Louis, MO, USA.', 'Division of Oncology, Washington University School of Medicine, Saint Louis, MO, USA.', 'Division of Public Health Sciences, Department of Surgery, Washington University, Saint Louis, MO, USA.', 'Division of Oncology, Washington University School of Medicine, Saint Louis, MO, USA.', 'Division of Oncology, Washington University School of Medicine, Saint Louis, MO, USA.', 'Division of Oncology, Washington University School of Medicine, Saint Louis, MO, USA.', 'Division of Oncology, Washington University School of Medicine, Saint Louis, MO, USA.', 'Department of Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Division of Oncology, Washington University School of Medicine, Saint Louis, MO, USA.']",['eng'],"['L30 CA153393/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5R01CA194552-03/National Institute of Health (NIH)', 'TL1 TR002344/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA171963/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'TL1TR002344/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'L30 HL124526/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA091842/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5R35CA210084-02/National Institute of Health (NIH)', 'R01 CA194552/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'National Cancer Institute (NCI)', 'R35 CA210084/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['Journal Article'],20200619,England,Transpl Int,Transplant international : official journal of the European Society for Organ Transplantation,8908516,,IM,"['Adult', '*Graft vs Host Disease', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Unrelated Donors']",PMC7704657,['NOTNLM'],"['*bone marrow transplantation', '*haploidentical', '*mobilized peripheral blood', '*reduced intensity conditioning']",2020/05/30 06:00,2021/06/25 06:00,['2020/05/30 06:00'],"['2020/03/20 00:00 [received]', '2020/04/15 00:00 [revised]', '2020/05/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/25 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/30 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/tri.13659 [doi]'],ppublish,Transpl Int. 2020 Sep;33(9):1089-1098. doi: 10.1111/tri.13659.

We investigated whether nilotinib is safe, and detectable in cerebrospinal fluid, and alters biomarkers and clinical decline in Alzheimer's disease. METHODS: This single-center, phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study investigated the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of nilotinib, and measured biomarkers in participants with mild to moderate dementia due to Alzheimer's disease. The diagnosis was supported by cerebrospinal fluid or amyloid positron emission tomography biomarkers. Nilotinib 150 mg versus matching placebo was taken orally once daily for 26 weeks followed by nilotinib 300 mg versus placebo for another 26 weeks. RESULTS: Of the 37 individuals enrolled, 27 were women and the mean (SD) age was 70.7 (6.48) years. Nilotinib was well-tolerated, although more adverse events, particularly mood swings, were noted with the 300 mg dose. In the nilotinib group, central nervous system (CNS) amyloid burden was significantly reduced in the frontal lobe compared to the placebo group. Cerebrospinal fluid Abeta40 was reduced at 6 months and Abeta42 was reduced at 12 months in the nilotinib group compared to the placebo. Hippocampal volume loss was attenuated (-27%) at 12 months and phospho-tau-181 was reduced at 6 months and 12 months in the nilotinib group. INTERPRETATION: Nilotinib is safe and achieves pharmacologically relevant cerebrospinal fluid concentrations. Biomarkers of disease were altered in response to nilotinib treatment. These data support a larger, longer, multicenter study to determine the safety and efficacy of nilotinib in Alzheimer's disease.

Moreover, some bisindole alkaloids such as the tubulin inhibitors, vinorelbine and vinblastine, have already been approved for cancer therapy, suggesting that bisindole alkaloids are a significant source of anticancer agents and lead hits. Bisindole hybrids have the potential to overcome drug resistance, enhance efficiency, and reduce severe side effects.

Historically, B cell ALL (B-ALL) and T-ALL have been treated in the same fashion despite differences in the biology of disease. Outcomes in the adolescent/young adult (AYA) population have improved significantly with the utilization of pediatric-based regimens. In addition, there may now be a role for the addition of nelarabine to frontline treatment in the AYA population. In older adults, choices in which regimen to pursue should account for the potential toxicities associated with pediatric-based regimens. Measurable residual disease (MRD) has taken on increasing prognostic value in T-ALL and may help to identify which patients should receive an allogeneic stem cell transplant. T cell lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-LBL) has traditionally been treated similarly to T-ALL, but additional management questions must be considered. Mediastinal irradiation does not seem to clearly improve outcomes, and there is considerable heterogeneity in the central nervous system (CNS) prophylaxis strategy used in prospective trials. CNS prophylaxis in AYA patients with T-ALL, on the other hand, can be safely achieved with intrathecal chemotherapy alone. Prospective data regarding CNS prophylaxis strategies in older adults are currently not available. Nelarabine-based regimens currently remain the standard in relapsed/refractory T-ALL; however, novel therapies targeting molecular aberrations in T-ALL are actively being investigated.","['Patel, Anand A', 'Thomas, Joseph', 'Rojek, Alexandra E', 'Stock, Wendy']","['Patel AA', 'Thomas J', 'Rojek AE', 'Stock W']","['Department of Medicine, Section of Hematology-Oncology, The University of Chicago Medicine, 5841 S.

They are new players in transcriptional regulation and cancer research. LincRNA-p21 is a p53-regulated lncRNA involved in the p53 transcriptional network. It has an important role in regulating cellular proliferation and apoptosis. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia is derived by a typical defect in apoptosis and characterized by clonal proliferation and accumulation of mature B cells. The aim of the present study was to assess the expression pattern of the lincRNA-p21 and investigate its potential role as a new prognostic marker in CLL. METHODS: The study was conducted on 80 newly diagnosed CLL patients and 80 age- and sex-matched controls. The analysis of LincRNA-p21 and the p53 downstream proapoptotic target genes (MDM2, PUMA, BAX, and NOXA) was performed by real-time PCR. The cytogenetic abrasions and expression of ZAP70 and CD38 were detected by FISH and Flow cytometry, respectively. RESULTS: LincRNA-p21 was significantly downregulated in CLL patients compared to controls. The downstream proapoptotic targets were significantly downregulated in CLL patients and positively correlated with lincRNA-p21. Low expression of lincRNA-p21 was associated with poor prognostic markers (advanced stages of CLL, del 17p13, ZAP70, and CD38 expression), failure of complete remission, shorter progression free survival, and overall survival. Low lincRNA-p21 expression was independently prognostic for shorter time to treatment. CONCLUSION: Low expression of lincRNA-p21 demarcates a more aggressive form of CLL with poor prognosis. Therefore, it could be considered as a new prognostic marker to predict disease outcome in CLL.","['Abo Elwafa, R', 'Abd Elrahman, A', 'Ghallab, O']","['Abo Elwafa R', 'Abd Elrahman A', 'Ghallab O']","['Clinical Pathology Department, Faculty of Medicine, Alexandria University, Alexandria, Egypt. rehamhalem@hotmail.com.', 'Internal Medicine Department (Hematology Unit), Faculty of Medicine, Alexandria University, Alexandria, Egypt.', 'Internal Medicine Department (Hematology Unit), Faculty of Medicine, Alexandria University, Alexandria, Egypt.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200528,Italy,Clin Transl Oncol,Clinical & translational oncology : official publication of the Federation of Spanish Oncology Societies and of the National Cancer Institute of Mexico,101247119,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BBC3 protein, human)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (PMAIP1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (MDM2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP70 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (CD38 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/genetics/metabolism', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/metabolism', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Proliferation/genetics', 'Down-Regulation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Progression-Free Survival', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Long Noncoding/*genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*genetics', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase/genetics/metabolism', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/genetics/metabolism']",,['NOTNLM'],"['CLL', 'LincRNA-p21', 'LncRNAs', 'Prognosis', 'TTT', 'p53']",2020/05/30 06:00,2021/08/28 06:00,['2020/05/30 06:00'],"['2020/03/11 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/28 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/30 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12094-020-02398-4 [doi]', '10.1007/s12094-020-02398-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Clin Transl Oncol. 2021 Jan;23(1):92-99. doi: 10.1007/s12094-020-02398-4.

Patient data were derived from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database and data from AML cells treated with chidamide, a novel benzamide chemical class of histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi), in vitro were derived from ChIPseq. Patients and AML cell data were analysed using GEO2R, GOseq, KOBAS, the STRING database and Cytoscape 3.5.1. We identified several genes related to the upregulation or downregulation of H3K9me3 in AML patients; some of these genes were related to apoptosis, autophagy, and the pathway of cell longevity. AML cells treated with chidamide in vitro showed the same gene changes. The protein interactions in the network did not have significantly more interactions than expected, suggesting the need for more research to identify these interactions. One compelling result from the protein interaction study was that sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) may have an indirect interaction with lysinespecific demethylase 4A (KDM4A). These results help explain alterations of H3K9me3 in AML that may direct further studies aimed at improving patient prognosis. These results may also provide a basis for chidamide as a treatment strategy for AML patients in the future.","['Dong, Aishu', 'Yang, Wenbin', 'Huang, He', 'Zhou, Xiaohai', 'He, Zhewei', 'Yao, Rongxing', 'Guo, Wenjian']","['Dong A', 'Yang W', 'Huang H', 'Zhou X', 'He Z', 'Yao R', 'Guo W']","[""Department of Emergency, The Second Affiliated Hospital and Yuying Children's Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, Zhejiang 325027, P.R.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the anticancer effects and molecular mechanisms of oridonin in mucoepidermoid carcinoma (MEC). Treatment with oridonin induced the apoptosis of MC3 and YD15 cell and inhibited the expression of myeloid cell leukemia1 (MCL1) through the regulation of the protein level through posttranslational regulation in these cell lines. Oridonin significantly increased the expression level of truncated Bid (tBid) as a downstream target of MCL1 and subsequently decreased the mitochondrial membrane potential. The ectopic expression of MCL1 protein was sufficient to reverse the induction of apoptosis and the increased tBid expression induced by oridonin in both cell lines. Taken together, these results suggest that oridonin exerts an apoptotic effect through the modulation of MCL1 and tBid in human MEC cell lines and may thus be a potential anticancer drug candidate for the treatment of human MEC.","['Han, Jung-Min', 'Hong, Kyoung-Ok', 'Yang, In-Hyoung', 'Ahn, Chi-Hyun', 'Jin, Bohwan', 'Lee, Wonwoo', 'Jung, Yun Chan', 'Kim, Kyung-A', 'Shin, Ji-Ae', 'Cho, Sung-Dae', 'Hong, Seong-Doo']","['Han JM', 'Hong KO', 'Yang IH', 'Ahn CH', 'Jin B', 'Lee W', 'Jung YC', 'Kim KA', 'Shin JA', 'Cho SD', 'Hong SD']","['Department of Oral Pathology, School of Dentistry and Dental Research Institute, Seoul National University, Seoul 03080, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Oral Pathology, School of Dentistry and Dental Research Institute, Seoul National University, Seoul 03080, Republic of Korea.', 'Cancer Center, School of Medicine, Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, Lubbock, TX 79430, USA.', 'Department of Oral Pathology, School of Dentistry and Dental Research Institute, Seoul National University, Seoul 03080, Republic of Korea.', 'Laboratory Animal Center, CHA University, CHA Biocomplex, Seongnam, Gyeonggi 13488, Republic of Korea.', 'Laboratory Animal Center, CHA University, CHA Biocomplex, Seongnam, Gyeonggi 13488, Republic of Korea.', 'Chaon, Seongnam, Gyeonggi 13488, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Dentistry, School of Medicine, Eulji University, Daejeon 34824, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Oral Pathology, School of Dentistry and Dental Research Institute, Seoul National University, Seoul 03080, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Oral Pathology, School of Dentistry and Dental Research Institute, Seoul National University, Seoul 03080, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Oral Pathology, School of Dentistry and Dental Research Institute, Seoul National University, Seoul 03080, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200507,Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein)', '0 (BID protein, human)', '0 (Diterpenes, Kaurane)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0APJ98UCLQ (oridonin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein/metabolism', 'Carcinoma, Mucoepidermoid/metabolism/*pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Diterpenes, Kaurane/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational/drug effects', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*mucoepidermoid carcinoma', '*oridonin', '*apoptosis', '*myeloid cell leukemia1', '*truncatedBid']",2020/05/30 06:00,2021/02/09 06:00,['2020/05/30 06:00'],"['2019/12/10 00:00 [received]', '2020/04/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/09 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/30 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.3892/ijo.2020.5061 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2020 Jul;57(1):377-385. doi: 10.3892/ijo.2020.5061.

The involvement of the central nervous system (CNS) or the optic nerve in CLL, however, is rare. We report a case of a previously untreated patient with CLL whose first manifestation of the disease was a progressive visual loss caused by optic neuropathy. Observations: Clinical manifestations, optical coherence tomography (OCT), and automated visual fields pointed to the diagnosis of neuropathy. Leukemic involvement of the CNS was confirmed after cells suggestive of CLL were found by cerebrospinal fluid analysis. Optic nerve infiltration is thought to be the cause of this optic neuropathy, and the clinical course and treatment are described herein. Conclusions: When readily diagnosed, optic nerve infiltration is a rare, yet manageable complication of CLL.","['Maleita, Diogo', 'Serras Pereira, Rita', 'Hipolito-Fernandes, Diogo', 'Moura-Coelho, Nuno', 'Cunha, Joao Paulo', 'Tavares Ferreira, Joana']","['Maleita D', 'Serras Pereira R', 'Hipolito-Fernandes D', 'Moura-Coelho N', 'Cunha JP', 'Tavares Ferreira J']","['Ophthalmology Department, Centro Hospitalar Universitario de Lisboa Central, Alameda Santo Antonio dos Capuchos, 1169-050, Lisboa, Portugal.', 'Ophthalmology Department, Centro Hospitalar Universitario de Lisboa Central, Alameda Santo Antonio dos Capuchos, 1169-050, Lisboa, Portugal.', 'Ophthalmology Department, Centro Hospitalar Universitario de Lisboa Central, Alameda Santo Antonio dos Capuchos, 1169-050, Lisboa, Portugal.', 'Ophthalmology Department, Centro Hospitalar Universitario de Lisboa Central, Alameda Santo Antonio dos Capuchos, 1169-050, Lisboa, Portugal.', 'Nova Medical School, Faculdade de Ciencias Medicas, Campo Martires da Patria 130, 1169-056, Lisboa, Portugal.', 'Ophthalmology Department, Centro Hospitalar Universitario de Lisboa Central, Alameda Santo Antonio dos Capuchos, 1169-050, Lisboa, Portugal.', 'Nova Medical School, Faculdade de Ciencias Medicas, Campo Martires da Patria 130, 1169-056, Lisboa, Portugal.', 'Ophthalmology Department, Centro Hospitalar Universitario de Lisboa Central, Alameda Santo Antonio dos Capuchos, 1169-050, Lisboa, Portugal.', 'Nova Medical School, Faculdade de Ciencias Medicas, Campo Martires da Patria 130, 1169-056, Lisboa, Portugal.']",['eng'],,['Case Reports'],20200128,United States,Am J Ophthalmol Case Rep,American journal of ophthalmology case reports,101679941,,,,PMC7244917,['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'Optic nerve infiltration', 'Optic neuropathy']",2020/05/30 06:00,2020/05/30 06:01,['2020/05/30 06:00'],"['2019/06/14 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/20 00:00 [revised]', '2020/01/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/05/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/30 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1016/j.ajoc.2020.100603 [doi]', 'S2451-9936(20)30007-4 [pii]', '100603 [pii]']",epublish,Am J Ophthalmol Case Rep. 2020 Jan 28;18:100603. doi: 10.1016/j.ajoc.2020.100603. eCollection 2020 Jun.,,['No conflict of interest exists.'],['(c) 2020 The Author(s).'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The first tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) imatinib is claimed to have superior efficacy and side effect profile as compared to traditional treatment options. This study was conducted to see our patients' molecular response to imatinib treatment. The objective of this study was to determine the frequency of complete molecular response in patients after six months of imatinib therapy. METHODS: A descriptive case series was designed and conducted in Oncology department, Jinnah hospital Lahore (May-November 2016). Newly diagnosed patients of CML aged between 20 and 65 years were enrolled. They were prescribed 400 mg imatinib daily and complete molecular response was assessed after six months of treatment. RESULTS: Mean age was 39.76 +/- 9.072 years. Some 66 of them were males while 69 were females. Some 40 patients (29.6%) were found to be in complete molecular response after six months of imatinib therapy.

In this study, three di-brominated N-alkylisatins were assessed for their ability to retain potency in vincristine (VCR) and 2-methoxyestradiol (2ME2) resistant ALL cell lines. For the first time, in vitro neurotoxicity was also investigated in order to establish their suitability as candidate drugs for future use in ALL treatment. Methods: Vincristine resistant (CEM-VCR R) and 2-methoxyestradiol resistant (CEM/2ME2-28.8R) ALL cell lines were used to investigate the ability of N-alkylisatins to overcome chemoresistance. Interaction of N-alkylisatins with tubulin at the the colchicine-binding site was studied by competitive assay using the fluorescent colchicine analogue MTC. Human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells differentiated into a morphological and functional dopaminergic-like neurotransmitter phenotype were used for neurotoxicity and neurofunctional assays. Two-way ANOVA followed by a Tukey's post hoc test or a two-tailed paired t test was used to determine statistical significance. Results: CEM-VCR R and CEM/2ME2-28.8R cells displayed resistance indices of > 100 to VCR and 2-ME2, respectively. CEM-VCR R cells additionally displayed a multi-drug resistant phenotype with significant cross resistance to vinblastine, 2ME2, colchicine and paclitaxel consistent with P-gp overexpression. Despite differences in resistance mechanisms observed between the two cell lines, the N-alkylisatins displayed bioequivalent dose-dependent cytotoxicity to that of the parental control cell line. The N-alkylisatins proved to be significantly less neurotoxic towards differentiated SH-SY5Y cells than VCR and vinblastine, evidenced by increased neurite length and number of neurite branch points. Neuronal cells treated with 5,7-dibromo-N-(p-hydroxymethylbenzyl)isatin showed significantly higher voltage-gated sodium channel function than those treated with Vinca alkaloids, strongly supportive of continued action potential firing. Conclusions: The N-alkylisatins are able to retain cytotoxicity towards ALL cell lines with functionally distinct drug resistance mechanisms and show potential for reduced neurotoxicity. As such they pose as promising candidates for future implementation into anticancer regimes for ALL. Further in vivo studies are therefore warranted.","['Keenan, Bryce', 'Finol-Urdaneta, Rocio K', 'Hope, Ashleigh', 'Bremner, John B', 'Kavallaris, Maria', 'Lucena-Agell, Daniel', 'Oliva, Maria Angela', 'Diaz, Jose Fernando', 'Vine, Kara L']","['Keenan B', 'Finol-Urdaneta RK', 'Hope A', 'Bremner JB', 'Kavallaris M', 'Lucena-Agell D', 'Oliva MA', 'Diaz JF', 'Vine KL']","['1School of Chemistry and Molecular Bioscience, Molecular Horizons, Faculty of Science, Medicine and Health, University of Wollongong, Northfields Ave, Wollongong, NSW Australia.grid.1007.60000 0004 0486 528X', 'Illawarra Health and Medical Research Institute, Northfields Ave, Wollongong, NSW 2522 Australia.', 'Illawarra Health and Medical Research Institute, Northfields Ave, Wollongong, NSW 2522 Australia.', 'Electrophysiology Facility for Cell Phenotyping and Drug Discovery, Wollongong, NSW Australia.', '1School of Chemistry and Molecular Bioscience, Molecular Horizons, Faculty of Science, Medicine and Health, University of Wollongong, Northfields Ave, Wollongong, NSW Australia.grid.1007.60000 0004 0486 528X', '1School of Chemistry and Molecular Bioscience, Molecular Horizons, Faculty of Science, Medicine and Health, University of Wollongong, Northfields Ave, Wollongong, NSW Australia.grid.1007.60000 0004 0486 528X', 'Illawarra Health and Medical Research Institute, Northfields Ave, Wollongong, NSW 2522 Australia.', ""4Children's Cancer Institute, Lowy Cancer Research Centre, UNSW, Sydney, NSW Australia.grid.1005.40000 0004 4902 0432"", '5ARC Centre of Excellence in Convergent Bio-Nano Science and Technology, UNSW, Sydney, NSW Australia.grid.1005.40000 0004 4902 0432', ""6School of Women's and Children's Health, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW Sydney, Sydney, NSW Australia.grid.1005.40000 0004 4902 0432"", '7Centro de Investigaciones Biologicas, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas, Madrid, Spain.grid.418281.60000 0004 1794 0752', '7Centro de Investigaciones Biologicas, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas, Madrid, Spain.grid.418281.60000 0004 1794 0752', '7Centro de Investigaciones Biologicas, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas, Madrid, Spain.grid.418281.60000 0004 1794 0752', '1School of Chemistry and Molecular Bioscience, Molecular Horizons, Faculty of Science, Medicine and Health, University of Wollongong, Northfields Ave, Wollongong, NSW Australia.grid.1007.60000 0004 0486 528X', 'Illawarra Health and Medical Research Institute, Northfields Ave, Wollongong, NSW 2522 Australia.', 'Centre for Oncology Education and Research Translation (CONCERT), Cancer Institute NSW Translational Cancer Research Centre, NSW, Sydney, Australia.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200515,England,Cancer Cell Int,Cancer cell international,101139795,,,,PMC7229617,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'Chemotherapy', 'Multi-drug resistance', 'N-alkylisatin', 'Neurotoxicity', 'P-glycoprotein']",2020/05/30 06:00,2020/05/30 06:01,['2020/05/30 06:00'],"['2020/03/25 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/05/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/30 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12935-020-01251-6 [doi]', '1251 [pii]']",epublish,Cancer Cell Int. 2020 May 15;20:170. doi: 10.1186/s12935-020-01251-6. eCollection 2020.,['ORCID: 0000-0001-6871-1149'],['Competing interestsThe authors declare there are no competing interests.'],['(c) The Author(s) 2020.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We describe a hybrid GWAS and phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) approach to uncover genotype-phenotype relationships and candidate risk loci, applying it to acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). METHODS: PheWAS was performed for 12 ALL SNPs identified by prior GWAS and two control SNP-sets using UK Biobank data. PheWAS-traits significantly associated with ALL SNPs compared with control SNPs were assessed for association with ALL risk (959 cases, 2,624 controls) using polygenic score and Mendelian randomization analyses. Trait-associated SNPs were tested for association with ALL risk in single-SNP analyses, with replication in an independent case-control dataset (1,618 cases, 9,409 controls). RESULTS: Platelet count was the trait most enriched for association with known ALL risk loci. A polygenic score for platelet count (223 SNPs) was not associated with ALL risk (P = 0.82) and Mendelian randomization did not suggest a causal relationship. However, twelve platelet count-associated SNPs were nominally associated with ALL risk in COG data and three were replicated in UK data (rs10058074, rs210142, rs2836441). CONCLUSIONS: In our hybrid GWAS-PheWAS approach, we identify pleiotropic genetic variation contributing to ALL risk and platelet count. Three SNPs known to influence platelet count were reproducibly associated with ALL risk, implicating genomic regions containing IRF1, proapoptotic protein BAK1, and ERG in platelet production and leukemogenesis. IMPACT: Incorporating PheWAS data into association studies can leverage genetic pleiotropy to identify cancer risk loci, highlighting the utility of our novel approach.","['Semmes, Eleanor C', 'Vijayakrishnan, Jayaram', 'Zhang, Chenan', 'Hurst, Jillian H', 'Houlston, Richard S', 'Walsh, Kyle M']","['Semmes EC', 'Vijayakrishnan J', 'Zhang C', 'Hurst JH', 'Houlston RS', 'Walsh KM']","['Medical Scientist Training Program, Duke University, Durham, North Carolina.', ""Children's Health and Discovery Initiative, Department of Pediatrics, Duke University, Durham, North Carolina."", 'Division of Genetics and Epidemiology, The Institute of Cancer Research, Sutton, Surrey, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, California.', ""Children's Health and Discovery Initiative, Department of Pediatrics, Duke University, Durham, North Carolina."", 'Division of Genetics and Epidemiology, The Institute of Cancer Research, Sutton, Surrey, United Kingdom.', ""Children's Health and Discovery Initiative, Department of Pediatrics, Duke University, Durham, North Carolina. kyle.walsh@duke.edu."", 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, California.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, Duke University, Durham, North Carolina.', 'Duke Cancer Institute, Duke University, Durham, North Carolina.']",['eng'],"['R21 CA158568/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA151022/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA142665/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA036401/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U24 CA114766/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'RC4 CA156449/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '085475/WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', '076113/WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', 'R01 CA140729/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA021765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA242439/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA098543/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM007171/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 GM092666/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA036401/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200528,United States,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev,"Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology",9200608,,IM,"['Case-Control Studies', 'Genome-Wide Association Study/*methods', 'Genomics/*methods', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Phenomics/*methods', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/pathology']",PMC7415687,,,2020/05/30 06:00,2021/11/25 06:00,['2020/05/30 06:00'],"['2020/01/21 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/23 00:00 [revised]', '2020/05/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/25 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/30 06:00 [entrez]']","['1055-9965.EPI-20-0113 [pii]', '10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-20-0113 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev. 2020 Aug;29(8):1606-1614. doi: 10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-20-0113.

The target genes for these regulators include fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) and Ariadne RBR E3 ubiquitin ligase 2 (ARIH2). FGF2 induces leukemia stem cell expansion in MLL1-rearranged AML. ARIH2 encodes TRIAD1, an E3 ubiquitin ligase required for termination of emergency granulopoiesis and leukemia suppressor function in MLL1-rearranged AML. Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), including the FGF receptor, are TRIAD1 substrates that are possibly relevant to these activities. Using transcriptome analysis, we found increased activity of innate immune response pathways and RTK signaling in bone marrow progenitors from mice with MLL1-rearranged AML. We hypothesized that sustained RTK signaling, because of decreased TRIAD1 activity, impairs termination of emergency granulopoiesis during the innate immune response and contributes to leukemogenesis in this AML subtype. Consistent with this, we found aberrantly sustained emergency granulopoiesis in a murine model of MLL1-rearranged AML, associated with accelerated leukemogenesis. Treating these mice with an inhibitor of TRIAD1-substrate RTKs terminated emergency granulopoiesis, delayed leukemogenesis during emergency granulopoiesis, and normalized innate immune responses when combined with chemotherapy. Emergency granulopoiesis also hastened postchemotherapy relapse in mice with MLL1-rearranged AML, but remission was sustained by ongoing RTK inhibition. Our findings suggest that the physiological stress of infectious challenges may drive AML progression in molecularly defined subsets and identify RTK inhibition as a potential therapeutic approach to counteract this process.","['Wang, Hao', 'Shah, Chirag A', 'Hu, Liping', 'Huang, Weiqi', 'Platanias, Leonidas C', 'Eklund, Elizabeth A']","['Wang H', 'Shah CA', 'Hu L', 'Huang W', 'Platanias LC', 'Eklund EA']","['Department of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, Illinois, USA.', 'Jesse Brown Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, Illinois, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, Illinois, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, Illinois, USA.', 'Jesse Brown Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, Illinois, USA.', 'Jesse Brown Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, Illinois, USA e-eklund@northwestern.edu.', 'Jesse Brown Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois, USA.']",['eng'],"['I01 BX004635/BX/BLRD VA/United States', 'R01 CA195642/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK121354/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20200528,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Kmt2a protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Arih2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ErbB Receptors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'ErbB Receptors/genetics/metabolism', '*Gene Rearrangement', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*enzymology/genetics/pathology', '*Leukopoiesis', 'Mice', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/pathology', 'Recurrence', 'Signal Transduction/genetics', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/genetics/metabolism']",PMC7363149,['NOTNLM'],"['*E3 ubiquitin ligase', '*TRIAD1', '*cancer chemotherapy', '*emergency granulopoiesis', '*gene regulation', '*innate immunity', '*kinase signaling', '*leukemia', '*mixed lineage leukemia (MLL)', '*receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)', '*ubiquitin ligase']",2020/05/30 06:00,2021/01/14 06:00,['2020/05/30 06:00'],"['2020/02/25 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/21 00:00 [revised]', '2020/05/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/14 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/30 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(17)48982-4 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.RA120.013206 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2020 Jul 10;295(28):9663-9675. doi: 10.1074/jbc.RA120.013206.

First report of the minimal residual disease-oriented GIMEMA LAL1913.,1559-1568,10.3324/haematol.2020.247973 [doi],"Early recognition of Ph-like acute lymphoblastic leukemia cases could impact on the management and outcome of this subset of B-lineage ALL. To assess the prognostic value of the Ph-like status in a pediatric-inspired, minimal residual disease (MRD)-driven trial, we screened 88 B-lineage ALL cases negative for the major fusion genes (BCR-ABL1, ETV6-RUNX1, TCF3-PBX1 and KTM2Ar) enrolled in the GIMEMA LAL1913 front-line protocol for adult BCR/ABL1-negative ALL. The screening - performed using the BCR/ABL1-like predictor - identified 28 Ph-like cases (31.8%), characterized by CRLF2 overexpression (35.7%), JAK/STAT pathway mutations (33.3%), IKZF1 (63.6%), BTG1 (50%) and EBF1 (27.3%) deletions, and rearrangements targeting tyrosine kinases or CRLF2 (40%). The correlation with outcome highlighted that: i) the complete remission (CR) rate was significantly lower in Ph-like compared to non-Ph-like cases (74.1% vs 91.5%, p=0.044); ii) at time point 2 (TP2), decisional for transplant allocation, 52.9% of Ph-like cases vs 20% of non-Ph-like were MRD-positive (p=0.025); iii) the Ph-like profile was the only parameter associated with a higher risk of being MRD-positive at TP2 (p=0.014); iv) at 24 months, Ph-like patients had a significantly inferior event-free and disease-free survival compared to non-Ph-like patients (33.5% vs 66.2%, p=0.005 and 45.5% vs 72.3%, p=0.062, respectively). This study documents that Ph-like patients have a lower CR rate, EFS and DFS, as well as a greater MRD persistence also in a pediatric-oriented and MRD-driven adult ALL protocol, thus reinforcing that the early recognition of Ph-like ALL patients at diagnosis is crucial to refine risk-stratification and to optimize therapeutic strategies.","['Chiaretti, Sabina', 'Messina, Monica', 'Della Starza, Irene', 'Piciocchi, Alfonso', 'Cafforio, Luciana', 'Cavalli, Marzia', 'Taherinasab, Akram', 'Ansuinelli, Michela', 'Elia, Loredana', 'Albertini Petroni, Guglielmo', 'La Starza, Roberta', 'Canichella, Martina', 'Lauretti, Alessia', 'Puzzolo, Maria Cristina', 'Pierini, Valentina', 'Santoro, Alessandra', 'Spinelli, Orietta', 'Apicella, Valerio', 'Capria, Saveria', 'Di Raimondo, Francesco', 'De Fabritiis, Paolo', 'Papayannidis, Cristina', 'Candoni, Anna', 'Cairoli, Roberto', 'Cerrano, Marco', 'Fracchiolla, Nicola', 'Mattei, Daniele', 'Cattaneo, Chiara', 'Vitale, Antonella', 'Crea, Enrico', 'Fazi, Paola', 'Mecucci, Cristina', 'Rambaldi, Alessandro', 'Guarini, Anna', 'Bassan, Renato', 'Foa, Robin']","['Chiaretti S', 'Messina M', 'Della Starza I', 'Piciocchi A', 'Cafforio L', 'Cavalli M', 'Taherinasab A', 'Ansuinelli M', 'Elia L', 'Albertini Petroni G', 'La Starza R', 'Canichella M', 'Lauretti A', 'Puzzolo MC', 'Pierini V', 'Santoro A', 'Spinelli O', 'Apicella V', 'Capria S', 'Di Raimondo F', 'De Fabritiis P', 'Papayannidis C', 'Candoni A', 'Cairoli R', 'Cerrano M', 'Fracchiolla N', 'Mattei D', 'Cattaneo C', 'Vitale A', 'Crea E', 'Fazi P', 'Mecucci C', 'Rambaldi A', 'Guarini A', 'Bassan R', 'Foa R']","['Hematology, Dept of Translational and Precision Medicine, Sapienza University, Rome, Italy.', 'Dept of Translational and Precision Medicine, Sapienza University and GIMEMA Data Center, Rome, Italy.', 'Dept of Translational and Precision Medicine, Sapienza University and GIMEMA Data Center, Rome, Italy.', 'GIMEMA Data Center, Fondazione GIMEMA Franco Mandelli Onlus, Rome, Italy.', 'Hematology, Department of Translational and Precision Medicine, Sapienza University, Rome, Italy.', 'Hematology, Department of Translational and Precision Medicine, Sapienza University, Rome, Italy.', 'Hematology, Department of Translational and Precision Medicine, Sapienza University, Rome, Italy.', 'Hematology, Department of Translational and Precision Medicine, Sapienza University, Rome, Italy.', 'Hematology, Department of Translational and Precision Medicine, Sapienza University, Rome, Italy.', 'Hematology, Department of Translational and Precision Medicine, Sapienza University, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine, Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, University of Perugia, Italy.', 'Hematology, Department of Translational and Precision Medicine, Sapienza University, Rome, Italy.', 'Hematology, Department of Translational and Precision Medicine, Sapienza University, Rome, Italy.', 'Hematology, Department of Translational and Precision Medicine, Sapienza University, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine, Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, University of Perugia, Italy.', 'Div of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation,Ospedali Riuniti Villa Sofia-Cervello, Palermo,Italy.', 'Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplant Unit, Ospedale Papa Giovanni XXIII, Bergamo, Italy.', 'Hematology, Department of Translational and Precision Medicine, Sapienza University, Rome.', 'Hematology, Department of Translational and Precision Medicine, Sapienza University, Rome.', 'Dept. of General Surgery and Medical-Surgical Specialties, University of Catania, Italy.', 'Hematology Division, S.

Based on our finding that MYSM1 colocalizes with gammaH2AX foci in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, leukemia cells, and melanoma cells upon induction of DNA double-strand breaks with topoisomerase inhibitor etoposide, we applied a mass spectrometry-based proteomics approach to identify novel 2A-DUB/MYSM1 interaction partners in DNA-damage responses. Differential display of MYSM1 binding proteins significantly enriched after exposure of 293T cells to etoposide revealed an interacting network of proteins involved in DNA damage and replication, including factors associated with poor melanoma outcome. In the context of increased DNA-damage in a variety of cell types in Mysm1-deficient mice, in bone marrow cells upon aging and in UV-exposed Mysm1-deficient skin, our current mass spectrometry data provide additional evidence for an interaction between MYSM1 and key DNA replication and repair factors, and indicate a potential function of 2A-DUB/MYSM1 in DNA repair processes.","['Kroeger, Carsten', 'Roesler, Reinhild', 'Wiese, Sebastian', 'Hainzl, Adelheid', 'Gatzka, Martina Vanessa']","['Kroeger C', 'Roesler R', 'Wiese S', 'Hainzl A', 'Gatzka MV']","['Faculty of Medicine, University of Ulm, 89081 Ulm, Germany.', 'Mass Spectrometry Core Facility, University of Ulm, 89081 Ulm, Germany.', 'Mass Spectrometry Core Facility, University of Ulm, 89081 Ulm, Germany.', 'Faculty of Medicine, University of Ulm, 89081 Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Dermatology and Allergic Diseases, Ulm University, 89081 Ulm, Germany.', 'Faculty of Medicine, University of Ulm, 89081 Ulm, Germany.']",['eng'],"['GA-2052/Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft', 'GA-2052/German Research Foundation']",['Journal Article'],20200526,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,"['0 (MYSM1 protein, human)', '0 (Proteome)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'EC 3.4.19.12 (Ubiquitin-Specific Proteases)', 'EC 3.6.4.- (Replication Protein C)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*DNA Damage', '*DNA Replication', 'Etoposide/toxicity', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', '*Protein Interaction Maps', 'Proteome/metabolism', 'Replication Protein C/metabolism', 'Skin/metabolism/radiation effects', 'Trans-Activators/genetics/*metabolism', 'Ubiquitin-Specific Proteases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Ultraviolet Rays']",PMC7312997,['NOTNLM'],"['DNA damage', 'HELLS', 'MYSM1', 'apoptosis', 'cancer', 'histone deubiquitinase', 'homologous recombination (HR)', 'melanoma', 'p53', 'gammaH2AX']",2020/05/30 06:00,2021/02/17 06:00,['2020/05/30 06:00'],"['2020/04/11 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/07 00:00 [revised]', '2020/05/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/05/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/17 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms21113762 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms21113762 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2020 May 26;21(11). pii: ijms21113762. doi: 10.3390/ijms21113762.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One important model system in this context are patient-derived xenografts (PDX). In the current study, we examined 20 acute leukaemia PDX models for growth behaviour, infiltration in haemopoietic organs and sensitivity towards cytarabine. PDX were injected intratibially (i.t.), intrasplenicaly (i.s.) or subcutaneously (s.c.) into immune compromised mice. For 18/20 models the engraftment capacity was independent of the implantation site. Two models could exclusively be propagated in one or two specific settings. The implantation site did influence tumour growth kinetics as median overall survival differed within one model depending on the injection route. The infiltration pattern was similar in i.t. and i.s. models. In contrast to the s.c. implantation, only one model displayed circulating leukaemic cells outside of the locally growing tumour mass. Cytarabine was active in all four tested models. Nevertheless, the degree of sensitivity was specific for an individual model and implantation site. In summary, all three application routes turned out to be feasible for the propagation of PDX. Nevertheless, the distinct differences between the settings highlight the need for well characterized platforms to ensure the meaningful interpretation of data generated using those powerful tools.","['Schueler, Julia', 'Greve, Gabriele', 'Lenhard, Dorothee', 'Pantic, Milena', 'Edinger, Anna', 'Oswald, Eva', 'Lubbert, Michael']","['Schueler J', 'Greve G', 'Lenhard D', 'Pantic M', 'Edinger A', 'Oswald E', 'Lubbert M']","['Charles River Discovery Research Services Germany GmbH, Am Flughafen 12-14, 79108 Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine I, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, 79106 Freiburg, Germany.', 'Charles River Discovery Research Services Germany GmbH, Am Flughafen 12-14, 79108 Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine I, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, 79106 Freiburg, Germany.', 'Charles River Discovery Research Services Germany GmbH, Am Flughafen 12-14, 79108 Freiburg, Germany.', 'Charles River Discovery Research Services Germany GmbH, Am Flughafen 12-14, 79108 Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine I, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, 79106 Freiburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['CRC 992 MEDEP C04, FOR 2674, LU 429/16-1), JCLS (R14/25)/Deutsche', 'Forschungsgemeinschaft']",['Journal Article'],20200525,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,,,PMC7281503,['NOTNLM'],"['*acute leukaemia', '*cytarabine', '*flow cytometry', '*patient-derived xenografts', '*tumour microenvironment']",2020/05/30 06:00,2020/05/30 06:01,['2020/05/30 06:00'],"['2020/04/28 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/22 00:00 [revised]', '2020/05/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/05/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/30 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers12051349 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers12051349 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2020 May 25;12(5). pii: cancers12051349. doi: 10.3390/cancers12051349.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The protein kinase C (PKC) is essential to confer MSC support to leukemic cells and may be responsible for the intrinsic leukemic cell growth. Here we have evaluated the capacity of a chimeric peptide (HKPS), directed against classical PKC isoforms, to inhibit leukemic cell growth. HKPS was able to strongly inhibit viability of different leukemic cell lines, while control HK and PS peptides had no effect. Further testing showed that 30% of primary samples from paediatric B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (B-ALL) were also strongly affected by HKPS. We showed that HKPS disrupted the supportive effect of MSC that promote leukemic cell survival. Interestingly, ICAM-1 and VLA-5 expression increased in MSC during the co-cultures with B-ALL cells, and we found that HKPS inhibited the interaction between MSC and B-ALL cells due to a reduction in the expression of these adhesion molecules. Of note, the susceptibility of B-ALL cells to dexamethasone increased when MSC were treated with HKPS. These results show the relevance of these molecular interactions in the leukemic niche. The use of HKPS may be a new strategy to disrupt intercellular communications, increasing susceptibility to therapy, and at the same time, directly affecting the growth of PKC-dependent leukemic cells.","['Ruiz-Aparicio, Paola Fernanda', 'Vanegas, Natalia-Del Pilar', 'Uribe, Gloria Ines', 'Ortiz-Montero, Paola', 'Cadavid-Cortes, Camila', 'Lagos, Jimmy', 'Flechas-Afanador, Jessica', 'Linares-Ballesteros, Adriana', 'Vernot, Jean-Paul']","['Ruiz-Aparicio PF', 'Vanegas NP', 'Uribe GI', 'Ortiz-Montero P', 'Cadavid-Cortes C', 'Lagos J', 'Flechas-Afanador J', 'Linares-Ballesteros A', 'Vernot JP']","['Grupo de Investigacion Fisiologia Celular y Molecular, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Nacional de Colombia, Bogota D.

To date, no multicenter comparative cost analyses have specifically evaluated alloHCT in children with acute leukemia. In this retrospective cohort study, we examined the relationship between survival and HCU while investigating the hypothesis that matched sibling donor (MSD) alloHCT has significantly lower inpatient HCU with unrelated donor (URD) alloHCT, and that among URDs, umbilical cord blood (UCB) alloHCT will have higher initial utilization but lower long-term utilization. Clinical and transplantation outcomes data from the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) were merged with inpatient cost data from the Pediatric Health Information System (PHIS) database using a probabilistic merge methodology. The merged dataset comprised US patients age 1 to 21 years who underwent alloHCT for acute leukemia between 2004 and 2011 with comprehensive CIBMTR data at a PHIS hospital. AlloHCT was analyzed by donor type, with specific analysis of utilization and costs using PHIS claims data. The primary outcomes of overall survival (OS), leukemia-free survival (LFS), and inpatient costs were evaluated using Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox and Poisson models. A total of 632 patients were identified in both the CIBMTR and PHIS data. The 5-year LFS was 60% for MSD alloHCT, 47% for well-matched matched unrelated donor bone marrow (MUD) alloHCT, 48% for mismatched unrelated donor alloHCT, and 45% for UCB alloHCT (P = .09). Total adjusted costs were significantly lower for MSD alloHCT versus MUD alloHCT by day 100 (adjusted cost ratio [ACR], .73; 95% confidence interval [CI], .62 to .86; P < .001), and higher for UCB alloHCT versus MUD alloHCT (ACR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.11 to 1.45; P < .001). By 2 years, total adjusted costs remained significantly lower for MSD alloHCT compared with MUD alloHCT (ACR, .67; 95% CI, .56 to .81; P < .001) and higher for UCB alloHCT compared with MUD alloHCT (ACR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.02 to 1.52; P = .0280). Our data show that UCB and MUD alloHCT provide similar survival outcomes; however, MUD alloHCT has a significant advantage in cost by day 100 and 2 years. More research is needed to determine whether the cost difference among URD alloHCT approaches remains significant with a larger sample size and/or beyond 2 years post-alloHCT.","['Arnold, Staci D', 'Brazauskas, Ruta', 'He, Naya', 'Li, Yimei', 'Hall, Matt', 'Atsuta, Yoshiko', 'Dalal, Jignesh', 'Hahn, Theresa', 'Khera, Nandita', 'Bonfim, Carmem', 'Hashmi, Shahrukh', 'Parsons, Susan', 'Wood, William A', 'Steinberg, Amir', 'Freytes, Cesar O', 'Dandoy, Christopher E', 'Marks, David I', 'Lazarus, Hillard M', 'Abdel-Azim, Hisham', 'Bitan, Menachem', 'Diaz, Miguel Angel', 'Olsson, Richard F', 'Gergis, Usama', 'Seber, Adriana', 'Wirk, Baldeep', 'LeMaistre, C Fred', 'Ustun, Celalettin', 'Duncan, Christine', 'Rizzieri, David', 'Szwajcer, David', 'Fagioli, Franca', 'Frangoul, Haydar', 'Knight, Jennifer M', 'Kamble, Rammurti T', 'Mehta, Paulette', 'Schears, Raquel', 'Satwani, Prakash', 'Pulsipher, Michael A', 'Aplenc, Richard', 'Saber, Wael']","['Arnold SD', 'Brazauskas R', 'He N', 'Li Y', 'Hall M', 'Atsuta Y', 'Dalal J', 'Hahn T', 'Khera N', 'Bonfim C', 'Hashmi S', 'Parsons S', 'Wood WA', 'Steinberg A', 'Freytes CO', 'Dandoy CE', 'Marks DI', 'Lazarus HM', 'Abdel-Azim H', 'Bitan M', 'Diaz MA', 'Olsson RF', 'Gergis U', 'Seber A', 'Wirk B', 'LeMaistre CF', 'Ustun C', 'Duncan C', 'Rizzieri D', 'Szwajcer D', 'Fagioli F', 'Frangoul H', 'Knight JM', 'Kamble RT', 'Mehta P', 'Schears R', 'Satwani P', 'Pulsipher MA', 'Aplenc R', 'Saber W']","[""Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorder Center Children's Healthcare of Atlanta Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia.

Baseline risk stratification proformas are presented for oncology patients prior to receiving the following cancer therapies: anthracycline chemotherapy, HER2-targeted therapies such as trastuzumab, vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitors, second and third generation multi-targeted kinase inhibitors for chronic myeloid leukaemia targeting BCR-ABL, multiple myeloma therapies (proteasome inhibitors and immunomodulatory drugs), RAF and MEK inhibitors or androgen deprivation therapies. Applying these risk stratification proformas will allow clinicians to stratify cancer patients into low, medium, high and very high risk of cardiovascular complications prior to starting treatment, with the aim of improving personalised approaches to minimise the risk of cardiovascular toxicity from cancer therapies.","['Lyon, Alexander R', 'Dent, Susan', 'Stanway, Susannah', 'Earl, Helena', 'Brezden-Masley, Christine', 'Cohen-Solal, Alain', 'Tocchetti, Carlo G', 'Moslehi, Javid J', 'Groarke, John D', 'Bergler-Klein, Jutta', 'Khoo, Vincent', 'Tan, Li Ling', 'Anker, Markus S', 'von Haehling, Stephan', 'Maack, Christoph', 'Pudil, Radek', 'Barac, Ana', 'Thavendiranathan, Paaladinesh', 'Ky, Bonnie', 'Neilan, Tomas G', 'Belenkov, Yury', 'Rosen, Stuart D', 'Iakobishvili, Zaza', 'Sverdlov, Aaron L', 'Hajjar, Ludhmila A', 'Macedo, Ariane V S', 'Manisty, Charlotte', 'Ciardiello, Fortunato', 'Farmakis, Dimitrios', 'de Boer, Rudolf A', 'Skouri, Hadi', 'Suter, Thomas M', 'Cardinale, Daniela', 'Witteles, Ronald M', 'Fradley, Michael G', 'Herrmann, Joerg', 'Cornell, Robert F', 'Wechelaker, Ashutosh', 'Mauro, Michael J', 'Milojkovic, Dragana', 'de Lavallade, Hugues', 'Ruschitzka, Frank', 'Coats, Andrew J S', 'Seferovic, Petar M', 'Chioncel, Ovidiu', 'Thum, Thomas', 'Bauersachs, Johann', 'Andres, M Sol', 'Wright, David J', 'Lopez-Fernandez, Teresa', 'Plummer, Chris', 'Lenihan, Daniel']","['Lyon AR', 'Dent S', 'Stanway S', 'Earl H', 'Brezden-Masley C', 'Cohen-Solal A', 'Tocchetti CG', 'Moslehi JJ', 'Groarke JD', 'Bergler-Klein J', 'Khoo V', 'Tan LL', 'Anker MS', 'von Haehling S', 'Maack C', 'Pudil R', 'Barac A', 'Thavendiranathan P', 'Ky B', 'Neilan TG', 'Belenkov Y', 'Rosen SD', 'Iakobishvili Z', 'Sverdlov AL', 'Hajjar LA', 'Macedo AVS', 'Manisty C', 'Ciardiello F', 'Farmakis D', 'de Boer RA', 'Skouri H', 'Suter TM', 'Cardinale D', 'Witteles RM', 'Fradley MG', 'Herrmann J', 'Cornell RF', 'Wechelaker A', 'Mauro MJ', 'Milojkovic D', 'de Lavallade H', 'Ruschitzka F', 'Coats AJS', 'Seferovic PM', 'Chioncel O', 'Thum T', 'Bauersachs J', 'Andres MS', 'Wright DJ', 'Lopez-Fernandez T', 'Plummer C', 'Lenihan D']","['Cardio-Oncology Service, Royal Brompton Hospital and Imperial College, London, UK.', 'Duke Cancer Institute, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA.', 'Breast Unit, Royal Marsden Hospital, Surrey, UK.', 'Department of Oncology, University of Cambridge and NIHR Cambridge Biomedical Research Centre, Cambridge, UK.', 'Division of Medical Oncology, Sinai Health System, Mount Sinai Hospital, Toronto, Canada.', 'UMR-S 942, Paris University, Cardiology Department, Lariboisiere Hospital, AP-HP, Paris, France.', 'Department of Translational Medical Sciences and Interdepartmental Center for Clinical and Translational Research (CIRCET), Federico II University, Naples, Italy.', 'Cardio-Oncology Program, Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA.', ""Cardio-Oncology Program, Brigham & Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA."", 'Department of Cardiology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Clinical Oncology, Royal Marsden Hospital and Institute of Cancer Research, London, UK.', 'Department of Medical Imaging and Radiation Sciences, Monash University and Department of Medicine, Melbourne University, Melbourne, Australia.', 'Department of Cardiology, National University Heart Centre, Singapore, National University Health System, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Division of Cardiology and Metabolism, Department of Cardiology, Charite and Berlin Institute of Health Center for Regenerative Therapies (BCRT) and DZHK (German Centre for Cardiovascular Research), partner site Berlin and Department of Cardiology, Charite Campus Benjamin Franklin, Berlin, Germany.', 'Department of Cardiology and Pneumology, University of Goettingen Medical Center, Goettingen, Germany.', 'German Center for Cardiovascular Research (DZHK), partner site Goettingen, Goettingen, Germany.', 'Comprehensive Heart Failure Center, University Clinic Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany.', 'First Department of Medicine -

METHODS: A sample of 317 patients with AML who were not eligible for intensive chemotherapy completed the FACT-Leu and EuroQol 5-Dimension (EQ-5D) measures (Utility Index and Visual Analogue Scale) every 28 days until the end of treatment. Internal consistency reliability was estimated with Cronbach's alpha. Concurrent validity was examined with correlations between FACT-Leu and EQ-5D scales, and known-groups validity was examined by determining whether FACT-Leu scales distinguished between Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ratings (PSRs) and between maximum adverse event toxicities at the baseline. This study examined responsiveness to change by anchoring change in the FACT-Leu scales to a 0.10 change in the EQ-5D Health Utility Index. RESULTS: Cronbach's alpha usually exceeded the threshold for good (>/=0.80) or excellent reliability (>/=0.90). Correlations between FACT-Leu and EQ-5D scales were moderate (r > 0.50) or high (r > 0.70). FACT-Leu scales distinguished between ECOG PSR groups with large effect sizes for an ECOG PSR of 0 versus an ECOG PSR of 2 (0.50 </= d < 0.80). In addition, Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General, Additional Concerns, FACT-Leu Total, and Trial Outcomes Index scales distinguished between patients with grade 3 or lower maximum adverse event toxicities and those with maximum adverse event toxicities higher than grade 3, but effect sizes were small (d < 0.50). Finally, FACT-Leu scale coefficients for a 0.10 change in the 5-level version of the EQ-5D HUI ranged between -0.01 and 4.30. CONCLUSIONS: The FACT-Leu is a suitable outcome measure for AML clinical trials among patients not eligible for intensive therapy, and it may have value for clinical monitoring.","['Peipert, John Devin', 'Yount, Susan E', 'Efficace, Fabio', 'Loefgren, Christina', 'Pierson, Renee', 'He, Jianming', 'Cella, David']","['Peipert JD', 'Yount SE', 'Efficace F', 'Loefgren C', 'Pierson R', 'He J', 'Cella D']","['Department of Medical Social Sciences, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, Illinois, USA.', 'Department of Medical Social Sciences, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, Illinois, USA.', 'Department of Medical Social Sciences, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, Illinois, USA.', 'Health Outcomes Research Unit, Italian Group for Adult Hematologic Disease, Rome, Italy.', 'Janssen Global Services, LLC, Raritan, New Jersey, USA.', 'Janssen Global Services, LLC, Raritan, New Jersey, USA.', 'Janssen Global Services, LLC, Raritan, New Jersey, USA.', 'Department of Medical Social Sciences, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, Illinois, USA.']",['eng'],['Janssen Pharmaceuticals'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Clinical Trial, Phase III', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200528,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', '*Drug Therapy', 'Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions/diagnosis/epidemiology/pathology/*therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/epidemiology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Outcome Assessment, Health Care', 'Psychometrics', 'Quality of Life', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Leukemia (FACT-Leu)', '*acute myeloid leukemia', '*health-related quality of life', '*leukemia']",2020/05/29 06:00,2021/05/21 06:00,['2020/05/29 06:00'],"['2019/11/03 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/27 00:00 [revised]', '2020/04/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/21 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/29 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.32977 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2020 Aug 1;126(15):3542-3551. doi: 10.1002/cncr.32977.

We have previously identified several differentially expressed lncRNAs in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) by microarray analysis. In the present study, we explored the regulatory circuitry, potential functions, clinical and prognostic relevance of these lncRNAs in MDS by developing a lncRNA regulation network. We identified a novel lncRNA, LOC101928834, which was significantly up-regulated in the bone marrow of patients with MDS and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We further evaluated the clinical relevance of LOC101928834 in 89 MDS and 110 AML patients and found that higher level of LOC101928834 expression was associated with higher white blood cell count, higher blast percentage, the subtype of refractory cytopenia with excess blasts (RAEB) and shorter overall survival in MDS patients. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis showed that LOC101928834 expression could discriminate MDS-RAEB patients from control with an area under the receiver-operating curve (AUC) of 0.9048. Moreover, functional analysis showed that LOC101928834 promoted cell proliferation and cell cycle progression, and activated Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway in vitro. In conclusion, LOC101928834 expression is correlated with clinical and biological features of MDS and may serve as a novel diagnostic and prognostic biomarker.","['Li, Nianyi', 'Ma, Yan', 'Wang, Wei', 'Yin, C Cameron', 'Wu, Wanling', 'Sun, Ruichen', 'Zhao, Guangjie', 'Li, Shuang', 'Wang, Xiaoqin']","['Li N', 'Ma Y', 'Wang W', 'Yin CC', 'Wu W', 'Sun R', 'Zhao G', 'Li S', 'Wang X']","['Department of Hematology, Huashan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Hematopathology, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, U.S.A.', 'Department of Hematology, Huashan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Huashan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Hematopathology, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, U.S.A.', 'Department of Hematology, Huashan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Computational and Applied Mathematics, Rice University, Houston, Texas, U.S.A.', 'Department of Hematology, Huashan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Huashan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Huashan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Clin Sci (Lond),"Clinical science (London, England : 1979)",7905731,"['0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cell Cycle/genetics', 'Cell Proliferation/genetics', 'Down-Regulation/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Regulatory Networks', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics', 'RNA, Long Noncoding/genetics/*metabolism', 'THP-1 Cells', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Up-Regulation/genetics', 'Wnt Signaling Pathway/*genetics']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Myelodysplastic Syndrome', '*biomarkers', '*large intervening non-coding RNA']",2020/05/29 06:00,2020/10/08 06:00,['2020/05/29 06:00'],"['2020/04/16 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/17 00:00 [revised]', '2020/05/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/08 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/29 06:00 [entrez]']","['225045 [pii]', '10.1042/CS20200439 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Sci (Lond). 2020 Jun 12;134(11):1279-1293. doi: 10.1042/CS20200439.,,,"['(c) 2020 The Author(s).

However, temporal variations in IPD risks following a cancer diagnosis remain poorly characterized. To inform vaccine guidelines and patient management, we assessed the IPD incidence among patients with HM and other malignancies. METHODS: The study population included all individuals aged >/=15 years during 2000-2016 in Denmark. Variations in incidences of IPD over time and between different types of hematological malignancies and diagnoses were assessed by Poisson regression. RESULTS: During 85 002 224 person-years of observation, 13 332 episodes of a first IPD were observed, of which 765 (5.7%) occurred among individuals with HM. Among HM patients, the IPD incidence rate decreased continuously during the study period (rate ratio per year, 0.91; 95% confidence interval, .90-.92). The risk of IPD in patients with HM was up to 39 times higher when compared to the background population and was highest for multiple myeloma, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Unlike other malignancies, the increased IPD risk did not wane with the time since HM diagnosis. We found a vaccination uptake of only </=2% in patients with HM and </=1% for those with other types of malignancies. CONCLUSIONS: Adults with HM in general and patients with lymphoid malignancies in particular have an increased risk for IPD, compared with patients with other types of cancer and with individuals free of cancer. The pneumococcal vaccination uptake is extremely low in this at risk-population. Efforts to prevent IPD in HM patients are continuously warranted.","['Andersen, Michael Asger', 'Niemann, Carsten Utoft', 'Rostgaard, Klaus', 'Dalby, Tine', 'Sorrig, Rasmus', 'Weinberger, Daniel M', 'Hjalgrim, Henrik', 'Harboe, Zitta Barrella']","['Andersen MA', 'Niemann CU', 'Rostgaard K', 'Dalby T', 'Sorrig R', 'Weinberger DM', 'Hjalgrim H', 'Harboe ZB']","['Department of Hematology, Rigshospitalet, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Epidemiology Research, Statens Serum Institut, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Hematology, Rigshospitalet, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Epidemiology Research, Statens Serum Institut, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Bacteria, Parasites and Fungi, Statens Serum Institut, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Hematology, Rigshospitalet, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Epidemiology of Microbial Diseases, Yale School of Public Health, New Haven, Connecticut, USA.', 'Department of Hematology, Rigshospitalet, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Epidemiology Research, Statens Serum Institut, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Bacteria, Parasites and Fungi, Statens Serum Institut, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Pulmonary and Infectious Diseases, Hospital of Nordsjaelland, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['R01 AI123208/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 TR001863/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Clin Infect Dis,Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America,9203213,['0 (Pneumococcal Vaccines)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Cohort Studies', '*Hematologic Neoplasms/complications/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', '*Pneumococcal Infections/epidemiology', 'Pneumococcal Vaccines', 'Streptococcus pneumoniae']",PMC7850540,['NOTNLM'],"['*hematological malignancies', '*invasive pneumococcal disease', '*mortality', '*pneumococcal serotypes', '*risk factors']",2020/05/29 06:00,2021/04/29 06:00,['2020/05/29 06:00'],"['2019/10/07 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/29 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/29 06:00 [entrez]']","['5848218 [pii]', '10.1093/cid/ciaa090 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Infect Dis. 2021 Feb 1;72(3):463-471. doi: 10.1093/cid/ciaa090.,,,"['(c) The Author(s) 2020.

Lack of vaccine or antiviral drug with clinical efficacy suggested that drug repurposing approach may provide a quick therapeutic solution to COVID-19. Nonstructural protein-15 (NSP15) encodes for an uridylate-specific endoribonuclease (EndoU) enzyme, essential for virus life cycle and an attractive target for drug development. We have performed in silico based virtual screening of FDA approved compounds targeting EndoU in search of COVID-19 drugs from commercially available approved molecules. Two drugs Glisoxepide and Idarubicin used for treatment for diabetes and leukemia, respectively, were selected as stronger binder of EndoU. Both the drugs bound to the active site of the viral endonuclease by forming attractive intermolecular interactions with catalytically essential amino acid residues, His235, His250, and Lys290. Molecular dynamics simulation studies showed stable conformation dynamics upon drugs binding to endoU. The binding free energies for Glisoxepide and Idarubicin were calculated to be -141 +/- 11 and -136 +/- 16 kJ/mol, respectively. The IC50 were predicted to be 9.2 microM and 30 microM for Glisoxepide and Idarubicin, respectively. Comparative structural analysis showed the stronger binding of EndoU to Glisoxepide and Idarubicin than to uridine monophosphate (UMP). Surface area calculations showed buried are of 361.8A(2) by Glisoxepide which is almost double of the area occupied by UMP suggesting stronger binding of the drug than the ribonucleotide. However, further studies on these drugs for evaluation of their clinical efficacy and dose formulations may be required, which may provide a quick therapeutic option to treat COVID-19.

In patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), recurrent somatic mutations in the calreticulin (CALR) gene, which encodes a molecular chaperone that resides in the endoplasmic reticulum, have been reported. Studies have defined mutant CALR as an oncogene promoting the development of MPN, and deciphered a novel molecular mechanism by which mutant CALR constitutively activates thrombopoietin receptor MPL and its downstream molecules to induce cellular transformation. The mechanism of interaction and activation of MPL by mutant CALR is unique, not only due to the latter forming a homomultimeric complex through a novel mutant-specific sequence generated by frameshift mutation, but also for its ability to interact with immature asparagine-linked glycan for eventual engagement with immature MPL in the endoplasmic reticulum. The complex formed between mutant CALR and MPL is then transported to the cell surface, where it induces constitutive activation of downstream kinase JAK2 bound to MPL. Refined structural and cell biological studies can provide an in-depth understanding of this unusual mechanism of receptor activation by a mutant molecular chaperone. Mutant CALR is also involved in modulation of the immune response, transcription, and intracellular homeostasis, which could contribute to the development of MPN. In the present article, we comprehensively review the current understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms for mutant molecular chaperone-induced cellular transformation.","['Edahiro, Yoko', 'Araki, Marito', 'Komatsu, Norio']","['Edahiro Y', 'Araki M', 'Komatsu N']","['Department of Hematology, Juntendo University Graduate School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Transfusion Medicine and Stem Cell Regulation, Juntendo University Graduate School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Juntendo University Graduate School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Takeda Science Foundation', '#19K08848/Japan Society for the Promotion of Science', '#19K17871/Japan Society for the Promotion of Science', 'Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology-Supported Program', 'for the Strategic Research Foundation at Private Universities Japan', 'the Japan Leukemia Research Fund', 'SENSHIN Medical Research Foundation']","['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200627,England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,"['0 (Calreticulin)', '0 (Receptors, Thrombopoietin)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Calreticulin/*genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum/immunology/pathology', 'Frameshift Mutation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/pathology', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2/metabolism', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogenes/*genetics', 'Receptors, Thrombopoietin/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/genetics/immunology', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Microenvironment/genetics/immunology']",PMC7419020,['NOTNLM'],"['JAK2 V617F', 'calreticulin', 'chaperone protein', 'myeloproliferative neoplasm', 'thrombopoietin receptor']",2020/05/29 06:00,2020/12/15 06:00,['2020/05/29 06:00'],"['2019/12/13 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/12 00:00 [revised]', '2020/05/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/15 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/29 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/cas.14503 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2020 Aug;111(8):2682-2688. doi: 10.1111/cas.14503.

The current study utilizes a publicly accessible, nationally representative cohort to explore relationships between fine particulate matter (PM2.5) exposure, smoking, and cancer mortality. METHODS: National Health Interview Survey and mortality follow-up data were combined to create a study population of 635,539 individuals surveyed from 1987 to 2014. A sub-cohort of 341,665 never-smokers from the full cohort was also created. Individuals were assigned modeled PM2.5 exposure based on average exposure from 1999 to 2015 at residential census tract. Cox Proportional Hazard models were utilized to estimate hazard ratios for cancer-specific mortality controlling for age, sex, race, smoking status, body mass, income, education, marital status, rural versus urban, region, and survey year. RESULTS: The risk of all cancer mortality was adversely associated with PM2.5 (per 10 microg/m(3) increase) in the full cohort (hazard ratio [HR] 1.15, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.08-1.22) and the never-smokers' cohort (HR 1.19, 95% CI 1.06-1.33). PM2.5-morality associations were observed specifically for lung, stomach, colorectal, liver, breast, cervix, and bladder, as well as Hodgkin lymphoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and leukemia. The PM2.5-morality association with lung cancer in never-smokers was statistically significant adjusting for multiple comparisons. Cigarette smoking was statistically associated with mortality for many cancer types. CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to PM2.5 air pollution contributes to lung cancer mortality and may be a risk factor for other cancer types. Cigarette smoking has a larger impact on cancer mortality than PM2.5 , but is associated with similar cancer types.","['Coleman, Nathan C', 'Burnett, Richard T', 'Higbee, Joshua D', 'Lefler, Jacob S', 'Merrill, Ray M', 'Ezzati, Majid', 'Marshall, Julian D', 'Kim, Sun-Young', 'Bechle, Matthew', 'Robinson, Allen L', 'Pope, C Arden 3rd']","['Coleman NC', 'Burnett RT', 'Higbee JD', 'Lefler JS', 'Merrill RM', 'Ezzati M', 'Marshall JD', 'Kim SY', 'Bechle M', 'Robinson AL', 'Pope CA 3rd']","['Department of Economics, Brigham Young University, 142 FOB, Provo, UT, 84602, USA.', 'Health Canada, Ottawa, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Economics, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Department of Agricultural and Resource Economics, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA.', 'Department of Public Health, Brigham Young University, Provo, UT, USA.', 'MRC-PHE Centre for Environment and Health, School of Public Health, Imperial College, London, London, UK.', 'Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Control and Population Health, Graduate School of Cancer Science and Policy, National Cancer Center, Goyang-si, Gyeonggi-do, Korea.', 'Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Engineering and Public Policy, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.', 'Department of Economics, Brigham Young University, 142 FOB, Provo, UT, 84602, USA. cap3@byu.edu.']",['eng'],"['MR/S019669/1/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'R835873/EPA/EPA/United States']",['Journal Article'],20200527,Netherlands,Cancer Causes Control,Cancer causes & control : CCC,9100846,"['0 (Air Pollutants)', '0 (Particulate Matter)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Air Pollutants/*adverse effects', 'Air Pollution/*adverse effects', 'Cigarette Smoking/*adverse effects/*mortality', 'Cohort Studies', 'Environmental Exposure/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*etiology/*mortality', 'Particulate Matter/*adverse effects', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Risk Factors', 'United States/epidemiology', 'Young Adult']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Air pollution', 'Cancer', 'Mortality', 'PM2.5', 'Smoking']",2020/05/29 06:00,2020/09/01 06:00,['2020/05/29 06:00'],"['2020/01/10 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/01 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/29 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s10552-020-01317-w [doi]', '10.1007/s10552-020-01317-w [pii]']",ppublish,Cancer Causes Control. 2020 Aug;31(8):767-776. doi: 10.1007/s10552-020-01317-w.

We analyzed 168 chronic phase CML patients treated with branded imatinib for a median of 12 years (range 1-16) at a single institution who switched to a single generic formulation in order to assess the safety and impact on molecular response. The Sokal risk was low/intermediate/high in 63%, 33%, and 4% of patients, respectively. The median duration of generic imatinib treatment was 19 months (range 4-22). Twenty-seven percent of patients were in MMR and 73% were in deep molecular responses (MR4-4.5) at the time of the switch. After 12 months of treatment with generic imatinib, 140 patients were evaluable for response: 23.6% and 76.4% were respectively in MMR and in deep molecular response. When the degree of response was compared with the best molecular response observed with branded imatinib, it was found that 84% of patients maintained the response previously achieved, 6% improved it, and 10% of patients had a molecular fluctuation from the previous deep molecular response to MMR. Only 1 patient lost the MMR and no patient switched to another TKI for inefficacy. In terms of safety, 20% of patients reported new or worsening side effects, but only 2 patients returned to branded imatinib for toxicity. Our data show that the switch to generic imatinib in patients who have been previously treated with branded imatinib appears to maintain efficacy, although a proportion of patients experience new or worsening side effects.","['Scalzulli, Emilia', 'Colafigli, Gioia', 'Latagliata, Roberto', 'Pepe, Sara', 'Diverio, Daniela', 'Stocchi, Francesca', 'Di Prima, Alessio', 'Efficace, Fabio', 'Martelli, Maurizio', 'Foa, Robin', 'Breccia, Massimo']","['Scalzulli E', 'Colafigli G', 'Latagliata R', 'Pepe S', 'Diverio D', 'Stocchi F', 'Di Prima A', 'Efficace F', 'Martelli M', 'Foa R', 'Breccia M']","['Hematology, Department of Precision and Translational Medicine, Policlinico Umberto 1, Sapienza University, Via Benevento 6, 00161, Rome, Italy.', 'Hematology, Department of Precision and Translational Medicine, Policlinico Umberto 1, Sapienza University, Via Benevento 6, 00161, Rome, Italy.', 'Hematology, Department of Precision and Translational Medicine, Policlinico Umberto 1, Sapienza University, Via Benevento 6, 00161, Rome, Italy.', 'Hematology, Department of Precision and Translational Medicine, Policlinico Umberto 1, Sapienza University, Via Benevento 6, 00161, Rome, Italy.', 'Hematology, Department of Precision and Translational Medicine, Policlinico Umberto 1, Sapienza University, Via Benevento 6, 00161, Rome, Italy.', 'Hematology, Department of Precision and Translational Medicine, Policlinico Umberto 1, Sapienza University, Via Benevento 6, 00161, Rome, Italy.', 'Hematology, Department of Precision and Translational Medicine, Policlinico Umberto 1, Sapienza University, Via Benevento 6, 00161, Rome, Italy.', 'Hematology, Department of Precision and Translational Medicine, Policlinico Umberto 1, Sapienza University, Via Benevento 6, 00161, Rome, Italy.', 'Hematology, Department of Precision and Translational Medicine, Policlinico Umberto 1, Sapienza University, Via Benevento 6, 00161, Rome, Italy.', 'Hematology, Department of Precision and Translational Medicine, Policlinico Umberto 1, Sapienza University, Via Benevento 6, 00161, Rome, Italy.', 'Hematology, Department of Precision and Translational Medicine, Policlinico Umberto 1, Sapienza University, Via Benevento 6, 00161, Rome, Italy. breccia@bce.uniroma1.it.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200528,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Drugs, Generic)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Drug Substitution/adverse effects/*methods', 'Drugs, Generic/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Dyspepsia/chemically induced', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/*diagnosis/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Adverse events', 'Chronic myeloid leukemia', 'Generic imatinib', 'Molecular response', 'Tyrosine-kinase inhibitor']",2020/05/29 06:00,2020/12/15 06:00,['2020/05/29 06:00'],"['2020/04/18 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/15 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/29 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00277-020-04096-1 [doi]', '10.1007/s00277-020-04096-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2020 Dec;99(12):2773-2777. doi: 10.1007/s00277-020-04096-1.

However, application of CAR-T to less differentially expressed targets remains a challenge due to lack of tumor-specific antigens and CAR-T controllability. CD123, a highly promising leukemia target, is expressed not only by leukemic and leukemia-initiating cells, but also by myeloid, hematopoietic progenitor, and certain endothelial cells. Thus, CAR-T lacking fine-tuned control mechanisms pose a high toxicity risk. To extend the CAR-T target landscape and widen the therapeutic window, we adapted our rapidly switchable universal CAR-T platform (UniCAR) to target CD123. UniCAR-T efficiently eradicated CD123(+) leukemia in vitro and in vivo. Activation, cytolytic response, and cytokine release were strictly dependent on the presence of the CD123-specific targeting module (TM123) with comparable efficacy to CD123-specific CAR-T in vitro. We further demonstrated a pre-clinical proof of concept for the safety-switch mechanism using a hematotoxicity mouse model wherein TM123-redirected UniCAR-T showed reversible toxicity toward hematopoietic cells compared to CD123 CAR-T. In conclusion, UniCAR-T maintain full anti-leukemic efficacy, while ensuring rapid controllability to improve safety and versatility of CD123-directed immunotherapy. The safety and efficacy of UniCAR-T in combination with TM123 will now be assessed in a phase I clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04230265).","['Loff, Simon', 'Dietrich, Josephine', 'Meyer, Jan-Erik', 'Riewaldt, Julia', 'Spehr, Johannes', 'von Bonin, Malte', 'Grunder, Cordula', 'Swayampakula, Mridula', 'Franke, Kristin', 'Feldmann, Anja', 'Bachmann, Michael', 'Ehninger, Gerhard', 'Ehninger, Armin', 'Cartellieri, Marc']","['Loff S', 'Dietrich J', 'Meyer JE', 'Riewaldt J', 'Spehr J', 'von Bonin M', 'Grunder C', 'Swayampakula M', 'Franke K', 'Feldmann A', 'Bachmann M', 'Ehninger G', 'Ehninger A', 'Cartellieri M']","['GEMoaB Monoclonals GmbH, 01307 Dresden, Germany.', 'Cellex Patient Treatment GmbH, 01307 Dresden, Germany.', 'Cellex Patient Treatment GmbH, 01307 Dresden, Germany.', 'Cellex Patient Treatment GmbH, 01307 Dresden, Germany.', 'Cellex Patient Treatment GmbH, 01307 Dresden, Germany.', 'Medical Clinic and Policlinic I, University Hospital ""Carl Gustav Carus,"" TU Dresden, 01307 Dresden, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium ""Carl Gustav Carus,"" TU Dresden, 01307 Dresden, Germany.', 'GEMoaB Monoclonals GmbH, 01307 Dresden, Germany.', 'GEMoaB Monoclonals GmbH, 01307 Dresden, Germany.', 'GEMoaB Monoclonals GmbH, 01307 Dresden, Germany.', 'Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf, Institute of Radiopharmaceutical Cancer Research, 01328 Dresden, Germany.', 'University Cancer Center ""Carl Gustav Carus,"" TU Dresden, Tumor Immunology, 01307 Dresden, Germany.', 'Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf, Institute of Radiopharmaceutical Cancer Research, 01328 Dresden, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium ""Carl Gustav Carus,"" TU Dresden, 01307 Dresden, Germany.', 'National Center for Tumor Diseases, ""Carl Gustav Carus,"" TU Dresden, 01307 Dresden, Germany.', 'GEMoaB Monoclonals GmbH, 01307 Dresden, Germany.', 'Cellex Patient Treatment GmbH, 01307 Dresden, Germany.', 'GEMoaB Monoclonals GmbH, 01307 Dresden, Germany.', 'Cellex Patient Treatment GmbH, 01307 Dresden, Germany.', 'GEMoaB Monoclonals GmbH, 01307 Dresden, Germany.', 'Cellex Patient Treatment GmbH, 01307 Dresden, Germany.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200429,United States,Mol Ther Oncolytics,Molecular therapy oncolytics,101666776,,,,PMC7240059,['NOTNLM'],"['ALL', 'AML', 'CAR-T', 'CD123', 'UniCAR', 'adoptive cell therapy', 'immunotherapy']",2020/05/29 06:00,2020/05/29 06:01,['2020/05/29 06:00'],"['2020/03/28 00:00 [received]', '2020/04/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/05/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/29 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1016/j.omto.2020.04.009 [doi]', 'S2372-7705(20)30059-0 [pii]']",epublish,Mol Ther Oncolytics. 2020 Apr 29;17:408-420. doi: 10.1016/j.omto.2020.04.009. eCollection 2020 Jun 26.,,,['(c) 2020 The Author(s).'],,,['ClinicalTrials.gov/NCT04230265'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: The 2004 and 2015 mortality statistics in China were accessed. The standardized mortality rates of the two periods were used to calculate the ratio of change (RC) value to assess the risk of death associated with time (social development with time) for cancers. The role of age in mortality with time was evaluated by the interaction between time and age using a Poisson regression. Results: In ascending order of RC, the factors were uterus; other malignant neoplasms; esophagus; stomach; skin; liver; leukemia; ""lip, oral cavity, and pharynx""; bladder; ""colon and rectum""; breast; prostate; lung; ovary; pancreas; ""lymphoid, hematopoietic, and related tissue""; and cervix cancers. According to their location on the scatter diagram, the 17 neoplasms could be divided into three groups, comprising undeveloped cancers (including four cancers), developed cancers (including three cancers), and cancers insensitive to social development. Unexpectedly, about 60% (as assessed by type of cancer) and two-thirds (as assessed by constituent ratio of death from all cancers) of cancers did not change with time. Conclusions: Most cancers may be insensitive to social development. Internal factors, including aging, may be a key factor for the occurrence of cancer.","['Hui, Liu']",['Hui L'],"['Department of Clinical Immunology, Dalian Medical University, Dalian 116044, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200506,United States,Biomed Res Int,BioMed research international,101600173,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'China/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Middle Aged', '*Neoplasms/epidemiology/mortality', 'Risk Factors', 'Young Adult']",PMC7229547,,,2020/05/29 06:00,2021/03/09 06:00,['2020/05/29 06:00'],"['2019/09/16 00:00 [received]', '2020/04/17 00:00 [revised]', '2020/04/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/05/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1155/2020/9043012 [doi]'],epublish,Biomed Res Int. 2020 May 6;2020:9043012. doi: 10.1155/2020/9043012. eCollection 2020.,['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3974-0930'],['The author declares that he has no conflicts of interest.'],['Copyright (c) 2020 Liu Hui.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Chemotherapy resistance is one of the most important challenges in T-ALL treatment. Alterations in cellular signaling pathways such as Notch1 and PI3K/AKT/mTOR play a role in cell proliferation, survival, and resistance to chemotherapy. Combination of Notch1 and PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibitors is an interesting and rational strategy in treatment of T-ALL. Interaction of AZD5363 as an inhibitor of PI3k/AKT/mTOR and Compound E as an inhibitor of Notch1 signaling pathway was investigated in a T-ALL pre-clinical model. Materials and Methods: T-ALL cell lines included Jurkat, Molt-4, and HPB- ALL cells were treated with AZD5363 and Compound E alone and in combination. Cell viability was determined by MTT assay. Flow cytometry was used to measure apoptosis. Interaction between AZD5363 and Compound E was assessed by Chou-Talalay method. Results: Combination treatment with AZD5363 and Compound E decreased cell viability with synergistic effect in all cell lines at 72 hours. Drug combination increased apoptosis even in Jurkat and HPB-ALL cells resistant to Compound E and AZD5363, respectively. Conclusion: Combination of AZD5363 with Compound E in T-ALL cell lines exhibited a synergistic effect. Cytotoxicity of drug combination increased in all T-ALL cell lines compared to each as a single drug. Simultaneous inhibition of Notch1 and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways as a possible treatment of T-ALL, provides a basis for future investigations.","['Khoshamooz, Halimeh', 'Kaviani, Saeid', 'Atashi, Amir', 'Mirpour Hassankiadeh, Seyed Hossein']","['Khoshamooz H', 'Kaviani S', 'Atashi A', 'Mirpour Hassankiadeh SH']","['Department of Hematology and Blood Banking, Faculty of Medicine, Tarbiat Modares University, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, Tarbiat Modares University, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Basic Sciences, School of Medicine, Shahroud University of Medical Sciences, Shahroud, Iran.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, School of Medicine, Guilan University of Medical Sciences, Rasht, Iran.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Iran,Int J Hematol Oncol Stem Cell Res,International journal of hematology-oncology and stem cell research,101511150,,,,PMC7231796,['NOTNLM'],"['AZD5363', 'Acute T-lymphoblastic leukemia', 'Compound E', 'Synergistic interaction']",2020/05/29 06:00,2020/05/29 06:01,['2020/05/29 06:00'],"['2020/05/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/05/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/29 06:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Int J Hematol Oncol Stem Cell Res. 2020 Apr 1;14(2):99-109.,,,"['Copyright : (c) International Journal of Hematology-Oncology and Stem Cell', 'Research & Tehran University of Medical Sciences.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bone marrow angiogenesis is crucial for pathogenesis of leukemia, and increasing bone marrow Mean Vascular Density (MVD) and level of angiogenesis factors are seen in patients with AML. Higher level of bone marrow MVD is associated with poor prognosis of AML according to previous studies. The present study aimed to compare bone marrow MVD in AML patients and controls and evaluate the relation between bone marrow MVD and number of residual blast cells after AML treatment. Materials and Methods: This study is a longitudinal study on AML patients who were admitted to Omid hospital. The bone marrow biopsies of patients with AML and patients with normal diagnosis -as control group- were taken from archives of pathology laboratory. Immunohistochemistry staining was used for all specimens by using thrombomodulin markers for calculating MVD. Flow cytometry findings of AML patients were assessed for percent of minimal residual disease (MRD) after AML treatment in AML patients group. Results: In this study, 27 AML patients and 24 healthy individuals with mean age of 40.92+/-15.13 years were evaluated, of whom 56.86% were male. The mean bone marrow MVD was significantly higher in AML patients than controls. The mean bone marrow MVD was significantly higher in males and there was insignificant reverse correlation between bone marrow MVD and MRD. About 59.3% of AML patients had response to treatment and there was no significant relationship between MVD and response to treatment. Conclusion: Bone marrow MVD was higher in AML patients than controls and there was no remarkable relationship between bone marrow MVD and MRD and response to treatment.","['Nematollahi, Pardis', 'Baradaran, Azar', 'Kasaei Koopaei, Zahra', 'Sajjadieh, Hamidreza']","['Nematollahi P', 'Baradaran A', 'Kasaei Koopaei Z', 'Sajjadieh H']","['Department of Pathology, Cancer Prevention Research Center, Isfahan University of Medical Science, Isfahan, Iran.', 'Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.', 'Department of Pathology, Isfahan University of Medical Science, Isfahan, Iran.', 'Department of Pathology, Isfahan University of Medical Science, Isfahan, Iran.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Isfahan University of Medical Science, Isfahan, Iran.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Iran,Int J Hematol Oncol Stem Cell Res,International journal of hematology-oncology and stem cell research,101511150,,,,PMC7231790,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Blood vessels', 'Minimal residual disease']",2020/05/29 06:00,2020/05/29 06:01,['2020/05/29 06:00'],"['2020/05/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/05/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/29 06:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Int J Hematol Oncol Stem Cell Res. 2020 Apr 1;14(2):93-98.,,,"['Copyright : (c) International Journal of Hematology-Oncology and Stem Cell', 'Research & Tehran University of Medical Sciences.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The direct delivery of drug into the cerebral spinal fluid requires that no preservative be used. Preserved drugs administered in error can result in significant neurotoxicity. A case series is described where preservative-containing methotrexate was incidentally administered intrathecally. All patients were treated at Children's Hospitals and Clinics of Minnesota. Medical records of the patients affected were reviewed and abstracted for this report. Four children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia received 1 dose of intrathecal methotrexate that contained 0.07% benzyl alcohol in January 2019. Overall, minimal to no symptoms were seen after dosing. The error was traced to a drug shortage in which benzyl alcohol-containing methotrexate was obtained and incorrectly stocked. A novel replacement drug procurement process was developed within our institution. The process includes sequestered queues where a drug awaits evaluation and independent double check of entry accuracy in the electronic health record and pharmacy parenteral dose preparation software prior to release and use. In contrast to IV administration, intrathecal benzyl alcohol at concentrations >/= 0.9% can cause significant neurotoxicity. Although minimal, if any, neurotoxicity was seen in patients who received a 10-fold lower concentration of benzyl alcohol than previously associated with complications, all institutions should recognize the potential for this error and implement similar safety precautions to ensure that this type of error will not occur.","['Messinger, Yoav H', 'Maxa, Kim L', 'Hennen, Emma M', 'Gossai, Nathan P', 'Hoff, David S']","['Messinger YH', 'Maxa KL', 'Hennen EM', 'Gossai NP', 'Hoff DS']",,['eng'],,['Case Reports'],,United States,J Pediatr Pharmacol Ther,The journal of pediatric pharmacology and therapeutics : JPPT : the official journal of PPAG,101089851,,,,PMC7243895,['NOTNLM'],"['acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'benzyl alcohol', 'drug shortage', 'drug-procurement', 'intrathecal', 'medication safety', 'methotrexate', 'pediatric', 'preservative']",2020/05/29 06:00,2020/05/29 06:01,['2020/05/29 06:00'],"['2020/05/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/05/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/29 06:01 [medline]']",['10.5863/1551-6776-25.4.328 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pediatr Pharmacol Ther. 2020;25(4):328-331. doi: 10.5863/1551-6776-25.4.328.,,"['Disclosure The authors declare no conflicts or financial interest in any product', 'or service mentioned in the manuscript, including grants, equipment, medications,', 'employment, gifts, and honoraria.

We assessed the role of etoposide in induction chemotherapy in pediatric AML. METHODS: This analysis retrospectively compared 2 induction chemotherapy regimens consisting of daunorubicin and cytarabine with etoposide (ADE) and without etoposide (AD). All newly diagnosed cases of AML younger than 18 years from January 1, 2012, onwards who completed their treatment before January 31, 2019, were included. Data of 186 cases, including 117 males (62.9%) and 69 females (37.1%), were analyzed. Demographic, initial presentation blood counts, and AML subtypes were almost identical in both groups. RESULTS: Complete remission rates were almost identical for the ADE versus the AD group (78.8% vs 80.0%, p = 0.980). Treatment-related mortality was higher, albeit not significantly, in the ADE (25 of 105; 23.8%) versus the AD (16 of 81; 19.8%) group (p = 0.508). Overall survival was 32 of 105 (30.5%) in the ADE and 43 of 81 (53.1%) in the AD group (p = 0.079), and disease-free survival was 29 of 105 (27.6%) and 39 of 81 (48.1%) in ADE and AD groups (p = 0.056), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Etoposide in induction treatment of pediatric AML is associated with increased episodes of bacterial and fungal infections and high treatment-related mortality. Moreover, it does not offer any survival benefit. In low- and middle-income countries like Pakistan, it should not be used in the induction treatment protocol.","['Ghafoor, Tariq', 'Ahmed, Shakeel', 'Khalil, Sumaira', 'Farah, Tanzeela']","['Ghafoor T', 'Ahmed S', 'Khalil S', 'Farah T']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,J Pediatr Pharmacol Ther,The journal of pediatric pharmacology and therapeutics : JPPT : the official journal of PPAG,101089851,,,,PMC7243905,['NOTNLM'],"['Pakistan', 'chemotherapy', 'developing country', 'etoposide', 'pediatric acute myeloid leukemia']",2020/05/29 06:00,2020/05/29 06:01,['2020/05/29 06:00'],"['2020/05/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/05/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/29 06:01 [medline]']",['10.5863/1551-6776-25.4.288 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pediatr Pharmacol Ther. 2020;25(4):288-294. doi: 10.5863/1551-6776-25.4.288.,,"['Disclosure The authors declare no conflicts or financial interest in any product', 'or service mentioned in the manuscript, including grants, equipment, medications,', 'employment, gifts, and honoraria.

We tested the prognostic impact of the 2017 ELN classification in a large cohort of 863 AML patients aged <60 years similarly treated on Cancer and Leukemia Group B/Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology studies. Based on multivariable models within each ELN genetic-risk group, we identified additional gene mutations that may refine the 2017 ELN risk classification. BCOR- or SETBP1-mutated favorable-risk patients with non-core-binding factor AML and IDH-mutated adverse-risk patients had intermediate-risk outcomes. Outcomes of NPM1/WT1 co-mutated patients and those of ZRSR2-mutated patients resembled outcome of adverse-risk patients. Moreover, FLT3-ITD(high) allelic ratio conferred adverse rather than intermediate-risk irrespective of the NPM1 mutation status, and DNMT3A mutations associated with very poor survival.

The aim of this nationwide population-based study is to assess trends in primary therapy and relative survival (RS) during 1989-2017. We included 9,985 patients with cHL. Radiotherapy alone was virtually not applied as from 2000 among patients aged 18-69 years with stage I/II disease, following the broader application of chemotherapy combined with radiotherapy. Chemotherapy only was the preferred treatment for patients with stage III/IV disease. Throughout the entire study period, around 20% of patients aged >/=70 years across all disease stages received no anti-neoplastic therapy. The most considerable improvements in 5-year RS were confined to patients aged 18-59 years. Five-year RS for patients with stage I/II disease diagnosed during 2010-2017 was 99%, 98%, 100%, 93%, 84%, and 61% for patients aged 18-29, 30-39, 40-49, 50-59, 60-69, and >/=70 years, respectively. The corresponding estimates for stage III/IV disease were 96%, 92%, 90%, 80%, 58%, and 46%. Collectively, the improvements in survival likely relate to advances in cHL management. These achievements, however, do not seem to translate into significant benefits for patients >/=60 years. Therefore, novel therapies are urgently needed to reduce excess mortality in elderly cHL patients.","['Driessen, Julia', 'Visser, Otto', 'Zijlstra, Josee M', 'Lugtenburg, Pieternella J', 'Plattel, Wouter J', 'Kersten, Marie Jose', 'Dinmohamed, Avinash G']","['Driessen J', 'Visser O', 'Zijlstra JM', 'Lugtenburg PJ', 'Plattel WJ', 'Kersten MJ', 'Dinmohamed AG']","['Department of Hematology, Amsterdam UMC, University of Amsterdam, LYMMCARE (Lymphoma and Myeloma Center Amsterdam), Cancer Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands. j.driessen@amsterdamumc.nl.', 'Department of Registration, Netherlands Comprehensive Cancer Organisation (IKNL), Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Amsterdam UMC, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Cancer Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Erasmus MC Cancer Institute, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Amsterdam UMC, University of Amsterdam, LYMMCARE (Lymphoma and Myeloma Center Amsterdam), Cancer Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Amsterdam UMC, University of Amsterdam, LYMMCARE (Lymphoma and Myeloma Center Amsterdam), Cancer Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Amsterdam UMC, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Cancer Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Research and Development, Netherlands Comprehensive Cancer Organisation (IKNL), Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Public Health, Erasmus MC, Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200528,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Chemoradiotherapy/*mortality', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hodgkin Disease/epidemiology/*mortality/pathology/therapy', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Netherlands/epidemiology', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Time Factors', 'Young Adult']",,,,2020/05/29 06:00,2021/02/26 06:00,['2020/05/29 06:00'],"['2020/02/19 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/07 00:00 [revised]', '2020/05/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/26 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/29 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-020-0875-0 [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-020-0875-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2021 Feb;35(2):494-505. doi: 10.1038/s41375-020-0875-0.

Rare soft tissue sarcomas containing KMT2A fusions have recently been reported, characterized by a predilection for young adults, sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma-like morphology, and an often aggressive course. Nonetheless, clinicopathologic and molecular descriptions of KMT2A-rearranged sarcomas remain limited. In this study, we identified by targeted next-generation RNA sequencing an index patient with KMT2A fusion-positive soft tissue sarcoma. In addition, we systematically searched for KMT2A structural variants in a comprehensive genomic profiling database of 14,680 sarcomas interrogated by targeted next-generation DNA and/or RNA sequencing. We characterized the clinicopathologic and molecular features of KMT2A fusion-positive sarcomas, including KMT2A breakpoints, rearrangement partners, and concurrent genetic alterations. Collectively, we identified a cohort of 34 sarcomas with KMT2A fusions (0.2%), and YAP1 was the predominant partner (n = 16 [47%]). Notably, a complex rearrangement with YAP1 consistent with YAP1-KMT2A-YAP1 fusion was detected in most cases, with preservation of KMT2A CxxC-binding domain in the YAP1-KMT2A-YAP1 fusion and concurrent deletions of corresponding exons in KMT2A. The tumors often affected younger adults (age 20-66 [median 40] years) and histologically showed variably monomorphic epithelioid-to-spindle shaped cells embedded in a dense collagenous stroma. Ultrastructural evidence of fibroblastic differentiation was noted in one tumor examined. Our cohort also included two sarcomas with VIM-KMT2A fusions, each harboring concurrent mutations in CTNNB1, SMARCB1, and ARID1A and characterized histologically by sheets of spindle-to-round blue cells. The remaining 16 KMT2A-rearranged sarcomas in our cohort exhibited diverse histologic subtypes, each with unique novel fusion partners. In summary, KMT2A-fusion-positive sarcomas most commonly exhibit sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma-like morphology and complex YAP1-KMT2A-YAP1 fusions. Cases also include rare spindle-to-round cell sarcomas with VIM-KMT2A fusions and tumors of diverse histologic subtypes with unique KMT2A fusions to non-YAP1 non-VIM partners.","['Massoth, Lucas R', 'Hung, Yin P', 'Nardi, Valentina', 'Nielsen, G Petur', 'Hasserjian, Robert P', 'Louissaint, Abner Jr', 'Fisch, Adam S', 'Deshpande, Vikram', 'Zukerberg, Lawrence R', 'Lennerz, Jochen K', 'Selig, Martin', 'Glomski, Krzysztof', 'Patel, Parth J', 'Williams, Kevin Jon', 'Sokol, Ethan S', 'Alexander, Brian M', 'Vergilio, Jo-Anne', 'Ross, Jeffrey S', 'Pavlick, Dean C', 'Chebib, Ivan', 'Williams, Erik A']","['Massoth LR', 'Hung YP', 'Nardi V', 'Nielsen GP', 'Hasserjian RP', 'Louissaint A Jr', 'Fisch AS', 'Deshpande V', 'Zukerberg LR', 'Lennerz JK', 'Selig M', 'Glomski K', 'Patel PJ', 'Williams KJ', 'Sokol ES', 'Alexander BM', 'Vergilio JA', 'Ross JS', 'Pavlick DC', 'Chebib I', 'Williams EA']","['Department of Pathology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, 02114, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, 02114, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, 02114, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, 02114, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, 02114, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, 02114, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, 02114, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, 02114, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, 02114, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, 02114, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, 02114, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Hartford Hospital, 80 Seymour Street, Hartford, CT, 06102, USA.', 'Department of Surgery, Lewis Katz School of Medicine at Temple University, Philadelphia, PA, 19140, USA.', 'Department of Surgery, Lewis Katz School of Medicine at Temple University, Philadelphia, PA, 19140, USA.', 'Department of Physiology and Medicine, Lewis Katz School of Medicine at Temple University, Philadelphia, PA, 19140, USA.', 'Foundation Medicine, Inc., 150 Second Street, Cambridge, MA, 02141, USA.', 'Foundation Medicine, Inc., 150 Second Street, Cambridge, MA, 02141, USA.', 'Foundation Medicine, Inc., 150 Second Street, Cambridge, MA, 02141, USA.', 'Foundation Medicine, Inc., 150 Second Street, Cambridge, MA, 02141, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, State University of New York Upstate Medical University, 766 Irving Avenue, Syracuse, NY, 13210, USA.', 'Foundation Medicine, Inc., 150 Second Street, Cambridge, MA, 02141, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, 02114, USA.', 'Foundation Medicine, Inc., 150 Second Street, Cambridge, MA, 02141, USA. erwilliams@foundationmedicine.com.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200527,United States,Mod Pathol,"Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc",8806605,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Epithelioid Cells/pathology', 'Female', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*genetics', 'Oncogene Fusion/*genetics', 'Sarcoma/*genetics/pathology', 'Soft Tissue Neoplasms/*genetics/pathology', 'Young Adult']",PMC7581494,,,2020/05/29 06:00,2021/08/27 06:00,['2020/05/29 06:00'],"['2020/04/04 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/12 00:00 [revised]', '2020/05/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/27 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/29 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41379-020-0582-4 [doi]', '10.1038/s41379-020-0582-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Mod Pathol. 2020 Nov;33(11):2307-2317. doi: 10.1038/s41379-020-0582-4.

Data were collected up to June 2018. We analyzed responses to treatment, relapses, survival, and the occurrence of second malignancies during follow-up. The median age was 59 years. In total, 208 patients (75%) were treated with purine analogs (PNAs), either cladribine (159) or pentosatin (49), as the first-line therapy. After a median follow-up of 127 months, the median overall survival was 27 years, and the median relapse-free survival (RFS) was 11 years. The cumulative 10-year relapse incidence was 39%. In patients receiving second-line therapy, the median RFS was 7 years. For the second-line therapy, using the same or another PNA was equivalent. We identified 68 second malignancies in 59 patients: 49 solid cancers and 19 hematological malignancies. The 10-year cumulative incidences of cancers, solid tumors, and hematological malignancies were 15%, 11%, and 5.0%, respectively, and the standardized incidence ratios were 2.22, 1.81, and 6.67, respectively. In multivariate analysis, PNA was not a risk factor for second malignancies. HCL patients have a good long-term prognosis. PNAs are the first-line treatment. HCL patients require long-term follow-up because of their relatively increased risk of second malignancies.","['Paillassa, Jerome', 'Cornet, Edouard', 'Noel, Stephanie', 'Tomowiak, Cecile', 'Lepretre,

We report that PML structures on nLDs in oleate-treated U2OS cells, referred to as lipid-associated PML structures (LAPS), differ from canonical PML nuclear bodies by the relative absence of SUMO1, SP100, and DAXX. These nLDs were also enriched in CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase alpha (CCTalpha), the phosphatidic acid phosphatase Lipin1, and DAG. Translocation of CCTalpha onto nLDs was mediated by its alpha-helical M-domain but was not correlated with its activator DAG. High-resolution imaging revealed that CCTalpha and LAPS occupied distinct polarized regions on nLDs. PML knockout U2OS (PML KO) cells lacking LAPS had a 40-50% reduction in nLDs with associated CCTalpha, and residual nLDs were almost devoid of Lipin1 and DAG. As a result, phosphatidylcholine and triacylglycerol synthesis was inhibited in PML KO cells. We conclude that in response to excess exogenous fatty acids, LAPS are required to assemble nLDs that are competent to recruit CCTalpha and Lipin1.","['Lee, Jonghwa', 'Salsman, Jayme', 'Foster, Jason', 'Dellaire, Graham', 'Ridgway, Neale D']","['Lee J', 'Salsman J', 'Foster J', 'Dellaire G', 'Ridgway ND']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Dalhousie University, Halifax, Canada.', 'Department of Pathology, Dalhousie University, Halifax, Canada.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Dalhousie University, Halifax, Canada.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Dalhousie University, Halifax, Canada dellaire@dal.ca.', 'Department of Pathology, Dalhousie University, Halifax, Canada.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Dalhousie University, Halifax, Canada nridgway@dal.ca.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Dalhousie University, Halifax, Canada.']",['eng'],['PJT62390/CIHR/Canada'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200527,United States,Life Sci Alliance,Life science alliance,101728869,"['0 (Fatty Acids)', '0 (Phosphatidylcholines)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', '2UMI9U37CP (Oleic Acid)', 'EC 2.7.7.15 (Choline-Phosphate Cytidylyltransferase)', 'EC 2.7.7.15 (PCYT1A protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.4 (LPIN1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.4 (Phosphatidate Phosphatase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CHO Cells', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Choline-Phosphate Cytidylyltransferase/*metabolism/physiology', 'Cricetulus', 'Fatty Acids/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lipid Droplets/*metabolism/physiology', 'Nuclear Envelope/metabolism', 'Oleic Acid/metabolism', 'Phosphatidate Phosphatase/*metabolism/physiology', 'Phosphatidylcholines/chemistry', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein/metabolism/physiology']",PMC7266991,,,2020/05/29 06:00,2021/07/15 06:00,['2020/05/29 06:00'],"['2020/04/22 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/13 00:00 [revised]', '2020/05/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/05/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/15 06:00 [medline]']","['3/8/e202000751 [pii]', '10.26508/lsa.202000751 [doi]']",epublish,Life Sci Alliance. 2020 May 27;3(8). pii: 3/8/e202000751. doi: 10.26508/lsa.202000751.

In this paper, we review the evidence supporting a causative link between these two entities as well as the direction of this relationship. We argue that the data favors CMML as the antecedent and causative disease state with a few notable exceptions. Better understanding of this relationship aids clinicians in the education of their patients and in determining the optimal management approach at the bedside. It is important to recognize opportunities to harmonize the treatments of these disease processes, which may enhance the effectiveness of treatment while reducing the burden of adverse effects from redundant therapies.","['Ambinder, Alexander J', 'Miller, John', 'DeZern, Amy E']","['Ambinder AJ', 'Miller J', 'DeZern AE']","['Department of Oncology, Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, 1650 Orleans Street, CRBI Room 186, 21287, Baltimore, MD, USA.

Flow recognition of CMML was initially based on an increase in the fraction of peripheral blood, CD14(+),CD16(-) classical monocytes >/=94% of total monocytes. An associated inflammatory disease can preclude the detection of classical monocyte fraction increase by inducing accumulation of CD14(+),CD16(+) intermediate monocytes. In such a situation, decrease in the Slan(+),CD14(low),CD16(+) non-classical monocyte fraction below 1.7% still supports CMML diagnosis. This robust, two-step flow cytometry assay identifies CMML with a very high sensitivity. Otherwise, detection of one or several acquired gene mutations with high variant allele frequency supports the diagnosis of CMML, oligomonocytic CMML or clonal monocytosis of clinical significance. Together, recent investigations support integration of flow cytometry analysis of peripheral blood monocyte subsets and new generation sequencing of a panel of 20-30 recurrently mutated genes in the diagnostic work-up of CMML.","['Solary, Eric', 'Wagner-Ballon, Orianne', 'Selimoglu-Buet, Dorothee']","['Solary E', 'Wagner-Ballon O', 'Selimoglu-Buet D']","[""INSERM U1170, Gustave Roussy Cancer Center, Villejuif, France; Faculte de Medicine, Universite Paris-Saclay, Le Kremlin-Bicetre, France; Departement D'Hematologie, Gustave Roussy Cancer Center, Villejuif, France.

A better understanding of cytogenetics and the genomic landscape of CMML have resulted in integrated risk models such as CMML Prognostic Scoring System (CPSS)-Mol and Mayo Molecular that may provide better prognostic accuracy for an individual patient. For example, frameshift/nonsense ASXL1 mutations have been consistently shown to confer inferior outcomes leading to its incorporation into some of the major risk classification systems.

We will also review how the current evidence supports its recognition as an independent disorder.","['Montalban-Bravo, Guillermo', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo']","['Montalban-Bravo G', 'Garcia-Manero G']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Blvd, Unit 428, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.

However, the optimal duration of EAT is unknown. In 2011, we have introduced a protocol, promoting discontinuation of carbapenems as EAT after 3 days in most patients and discouraging the standard use of vancomycin. This study assesses the effect of introducing this protocol on carbapenem and vancomycin use in high-risk haematological patients and its safety. METHODS: A retrospective before-after study was performed comparing a cohort from 2007 to 2011 (period I, before restrictive EAT use) with a cohort from 2011 to 2014 (period II, restrictive EAT use). Neutropenic episodes related to chemotherapy or stem cell transplantation (SCT) in patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) or high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) were analysed. The primary outcome was the use of carbapenems and vancomycin as EAT during neutropenia, expressed as days of therapy (DOT)/100 neutropenic days and analysed with interrupted time series (ITS). Also the use of other antibiotics was analysed. Safety measurements included 30-day mortality, ICU admittance within 30 days after start of EAT and positive blood cultures with carbapenem-susceptible microorganisms. RESULTS: Three hundred sixty-two neutropenic episodes with a median duration of 18 days were analysed, involving 201 patients. ITS analysis showed decreased carbapenem use with a step change of - 16.1 DOT/100 neutropenic days (95% CI - 26.77 to - 1.39) and an overall reduction of 21.6% (8.7 DOT/100 neutropenic days). Vancomycin use decreased with a step change of - 13.7 DOT/100 neutropenic days (95% CI - 23.75 to - 3.0) and an overall reduction of 54.7% (14.6 DOT/100 neutropenic days). The use of all antibiotics combined decreased from 155.6 to 138 DOT/100 neutropenic days, a reduction of 11.3%. No deaths directly related to early discontinuation of EAT were identified, also no notable difference in ICU-admission (9/116 in period I, 9/152 in period II) and positive blood cultures (4/116 in period I, 2/152 in period II) was detected. CONCLUSION: The introduction of a protocol promoting restrictive use of EAT resulted in reduction of carbapenem and vancomycin use and appears to be safe in AML or high-risk MDS patients with febrile neutropenia during chemotherapy or SCT.","['Niessen, F A', 'van Mourik, M S M', 'Bruns, A H W', 'Raijmakers, R A P', 'de Groot, M C H', 'van der Bruggen, T']","['Niessen FA', 'van Mourik MSM', 'Bruns AHW', 'Raijmakers RAP', 'de Groot MCH', 'van der Bruggen T']","['Department of Medical Microbiology and Infection Control, University Medical Centre Utrecht, Room G04.614, Heidelberglaan 100, Postbus 85500, 3508, GA, Utrecht, The Netherlands. f.a.niessen@umcutrecht.nl.', 'Department of Medical Microbiology and Infection Control, University Medical Centre Utrecht, Room G04.614, Heidelberglaan 100, Postbus 85500, 3508, GA, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Medical Microbiology and Infection Control, University Medical Centre Utrecht, Room G04.614, Heidelberglaan 100, Postbus 85500, 3508, GA, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Haematology, University Medical Centre Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Haematology, University Medical Centre Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Clinical Chemistry and Haematology, Division Laboratories, Pharmacy and Biomedical Genetics, University Medical Centre Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Medical Microbiology and Infection Control, University Medical Centre Utrecht, Room G04.614, Heidelberglaan 100, Postbus 85500, 3508, GA, Utrecht, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200527,England,Antimicrob Resist Infect Control,Antimicrobial resistance and infection control,101585411,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Carbapenems)', '6Q205EH1VU (Vancomycin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects', 'Bacteremia/*prevention & control', 'Carbapenems/*therapeutic use', 'Controlled Before-After Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interrupted Time Series Analysis', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*therapy', 'Neutropenia/*chemically induced', 'Practice Guidelines as Topic', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Vancomycin/*therapeutic use']",PMC7251665,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myeloid leukaemia', '*Antibiotic stewardship', '*Carbapenems', '*Febrile neutropenia', '*Interrupted time series', '*Myelodysplastic syndrome', '*Vancomycin']",2020/05/29 06:00,2021/04/02 06:00,['2020/05/29 06:00'],"['2019/11/05 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/05/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/02 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13756-020-00729-2 [doi]', '10.1186/s13756-020-00729-2 [pii]']",epublish,Antimicrob Resist Infect Control. 2020 May 27;9(1):74. doi: 10.1186/s13756-020-00729-2.,['ORCID: 0000-0001-6586-9776'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In recent years, a number of new treatment strategies and compounds were developed for the treatment of AML. There were several randomized controlled clinical trials with the objective to improve patients' management and patients' outcome in AML. Unfortunately, these trials are not always directly comparable since they do not measure the same outcomes, and currently there are no core outcome sets that can be used to guide outcome selection and harmonization in this disease area. The HARMONY (Healthcare Alliance for Resourceful Medicine Offensive against Neoplasms in Hematology) Alliance is a public-private European network established in 2017 and currently includes 53 partners and 32 associated members from 22 countries. Amongst many other goals of the HARMONY Alliance, Work Package 2 focuses on defining outcomes that are relevant to each hematological malignancy. Accordingly, this pilot study will be performed to define a core outcome set in AML. METHODS: The pilot study will use a three-round Delphi survey and a final consensus meeting to define a core outcome set. Participants will be recruited from different stakeholder groups, including patients, clinicians, regulators and members of the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations. At the pre-Delphi stage, a literature research was conducted followed by several semi-structured interviews of clinical public and private key opinion leaders. Subsequently, the preliminary outcome list was discussed in several multi-stakeholder face-to-face meetings. The Delphi survey will reduce the preliminary outcome list to essential core outcomes. After completion of the last Delphi round, a final face-to-face meeting is planned to achieve consensus about the core outcome set in AML. DISCUSSION: As part of the HARMONY Alliance, the pilot Delphi aims to define a core outcome set in AML on the basis of a multi-stakeholder consensus. Such a core outcome set will help to allow consistent comparison of future clinical trials and real-world evidence research and ensures that appropriate outcomes valued by a range of stakeholders are measured within future trials.","['Lang, Katharina M', 'Harrison, Kathryn L', 'Williamson, Paula R', 'Huntly, Brian J P', 'Ossenkoppele, Gert', 'Geissler, Jan', 'Bereczky, Tamas', 'Hernandez-Rivas, Jesus M', 'Chevrou-Severac, Helene', 'Goodbody, Rory', 'Schulze-Rath, Renate', 'Bullinger, Lars']","['Lang KM', 'Harrison KL', 'Williamson PR', 'Huntly BJP', 'Ossenkoppele G', 'Geissler J', 'Bereczky T', 'Hernandez-Rivas JM', 'Chevrou-Severac H', 'Goodbody R', 'Schulze-Rath R', 'Bullinger L']","['Charite University Medicine, Chariteplatz 1, Berlin, 10117, Germany. katy.harrison@nice.org.uk.', 'NICE, National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, 10 Spring Gardens, London, SW1A 2BU, UK.', 'MRC North West Hub for Trials Methodology Research, University of Liverpool, Brownlow Hill, Liverpool, L69 7ZX, UK.', 'University of Cambridge, Trinity Lane, Cambridge, CB2 1TN, UK.', 'VU University Medical Center, De Boelelaan 1105, Amsterdam, 1081 HV, Netherlands.', 'Patvocates, Am Rothenanger 1b, Riemerling, 85521, Germany.', 'Patvocates, Am Rothenanger 1b, Riemerling, 85521, Germany.', 'Universidad de Salamanca, Patio de Escuelas, 1, Salamanca, 37008, Spain.', 'Celgene International, Route de Perreux 1, Boudry, CH-2017, Switzerland.', 'AbbVie, 14 Riverwalk, Dublin, D24 XN32, Ireland.', 'Bayer AG, Mullerstrasse 178, Berlin, 13353, Germany.', 'Charite University Medicine, Chariteplatz 1, Berlin, 10117, Germany.']",['eng'],"['MC_PC_12009/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'MC_PC_17230/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', '116026/Innovative Medicine Initiative (IMI) 2', 'Cash Grant - HARMONY project/Bayer AG']",['Journal Article'],20200527,England,Trials,Trials,101263253,,IM,"['Biomedical Research/methods/standards/statistics & numerical data', 'Consensus', '*Delphi Technique', 'Endpoint Determination/*methods/standards', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*therapy', 'Outcome Assessment, Health Care/*methods/standards/statistics & numerical data', 'Pilot Projects', 'Research Design']",PMC7251906,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Core outcome set', 'Delphi process']",2020/05/29 06:00,2021/02/20 06:00,['2020/05/29 06:00'],"['2019/07/24 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/05/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/20 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13063-020-04384-1 [doi]', '10.1186/s13063-020-04384-1 [pii]']",epublish,Trials. 2020 May 27;21(1):437. doi: 10.1186/s13063-020-04384-1.,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8855-884X'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PICC-related thrombi are not uncommon and may result in pulmonary embolism and the formation of thrombi in the right atrium. The latter are associated with an increased risk of subsequent morbidity or mortality because of their potential for embolization in the pulmonary vasculature. CASE PRESENTATION: A 16-year-old male with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) was admitted to our hospital after an echocardiographic examination revealed a ring-like structure in the right atrium that was still present after 6 months' anticoagulation treatment with aspirin. The boy had had a PICC inserted 2 years previously for chemotherapy; the PICC was intact and successfully removed 18 months after insertion when chemotherapy is finished. Subsequent computer tomography and radiography differentiated right atrial ring-shaped mass with a diameter of approximately 15 mm. Cardiac surgery was performed to remove the mass which was found to be a calcified thrombus. CONCLUSION: Although this is a rare occurrence, recognition of the possibility of a calcified thrombus may minimize the misdiagnosis of PICC-related thrombus and allow surgical retrieval if the thrombus is sufficiently large.","['Luo, Yu Lan', 'Zhang, Jinmei', 'Tang, Menglin']","['Luo YL', 'Zhang J', 'Tang M']","['Department of Pediatric Intensive Care Unit, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Guoxuexiang 37th, 610041, Chengdu, Sichuan, P.R.

CD123 (interleukin-3 receptor alpha unit) is highly expressed in many hematologic malignancies, including BPDCN. Tagraxofusp-ezrs (tagraxofusp from herein) is an agent that consists of interleukin-3 fused to a truncated diphtheria toxin, targeting CD123. The Food and Drug Administration recently approved tagraxofusp as therapy for BPDCN for adults and children aged 2 years and older. AREAS COVERED: We discuss the history and clinical background of BPDCN along with tagraxofusp as its first-line therapy. We review the clinical efficacy and safety profile of tagraxofusp in adults including proposed sensitivity and resistance. Finally, we summarize tagraxofusp use in the pediatric population. EXPERT OPINION: Tagraxofusp is a newly approved therapy for BPDCN, a hematologic malignancy that has overall historically poor outcomes. With its significant efficacy, many patients were successfully bridged to stem cell transplantation in the clinical trial leading to its ultimate approval. Clinical awareness for major toxicities, including capillary leak syndrome will be a critical aspect of using this novel agent. In the future, investigation of its use in other hematologic malignancies and expansion of clinical trials in pediatric populations with BPDCN are warranted.","['Lee, Sophia S', 'McCue, Deborah', 'Pemmaraju, Naveen']","['Lee SS', 'McCue D', 'Pemmaraju N']","['Department of Internal Medicine, The University of Texas School of Health Sciences at Houston , Houston, TX, USA.', 'Division of Pharmacy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center , Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center , Houston, TX, USA.']",['eng'],['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",20200624,England,Expert Rev Anticancer Ther,Expert review of anticancer therapy,101123358,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (IL3RA protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-3 Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '8ZHS5657EH (tagraxofusp)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacology', 'Child', 'Dendritic Cells/pathology', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3 Receptor alpha Subunit/metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacology']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*BPDCN', '*Blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm', '*CD123', '*SL-401', '*leukemia', '*tagraxofusp']",2020/05/29 06:00,2021/03/19 06:00,['2020/05/29 06:00'],"['2020/05/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/19 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/29 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/14737140.2020.1776120 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Rev Anticancer Ther. 2020 Jul;20(7):543-550. doi: 10.1080/14737140.2020.1776120.

The clinical features and effective treatment options for this condition are still unclear.Case description: A 10-year-old boy with leukaemia and receiving immunosuppressive regimen presented with decreasing visual acuity to counting fingers in his left eye for 2 weeks. Fundus examination revealed disc swelling, retinitis, retinal exudates and haemorrhages. Aqueous polymerase chain reaction was positive for Epstein-Barr virus DNA but negative for cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus and varicella zoster virus DNA. Systemic acyclovir and intravitreal ganciclovir injection were administered. Seven months later, retinitis resolved with remnant retinal fibrosis, and visual acuity improved to 20/500. CONCLUSION: Epstein-Barr virus is rarely identified as a sole pathogen in retinitis. Peripapillary predilection might be another type of presenting feature apart from the more-commonly reported peripheral acute retinal necrosis.","['Chou, Hung-Da', 'Teh, Wee Min', 'Sun, Ming-Hui', 'Chen, Kuan-Jen']","['Chou HD', 'Teh WM', 'Sun MH', 'Chen KJ']","['Department of Ophthalmology, Linkou Medical Center, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taoyuan, Taiwan.', 'College of Medicine, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan, Taiwan.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, Linkou Medical Center, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taoyuan, Taiwan.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, Hospital Selayang, Batu Caves, Malaysia.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, Linkou Medical Center, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taoyuan, Taiwan.', 'College of Medicine, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan, Taiwan.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, Linkou Medical Center, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taoyuan, Taiwan.', 'College of Medicine, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan, Taiwan.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20200527,United States,Eur J Ophthalmol,European journal of ophthalmology,9110772,['0 (Antiviral Agents)'],IM,"['Antiviral Agents/therapeutic use', 'Child', '*Epstein-Barr Virus Infections/diagnosis/drug therapy', '*Eye Infections, Viral/diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/genetics', 'Humans', 'Male', '*Retinal Necrosis Syndrome, Acute/diagnosis/drug therapy', '*Retinitis/diagnosis/drug therapy']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Epstein-Barr virus', 'acute retinal necrosis', 'optical coherence tomography', 'retinitis']",2020/05/29 06:00,2021/12/15 06:00,['2020/05/29 06:00'],"['2020/05/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/15 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/29 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/1120672120926855 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Ophthalmol. 2021 Sep;31(5):NP83-NP87. doi: 10.1177/1120672120926855.

Previous reports have shown that FLT3-ITD induces a specific phenotype in leukemic blasts, which is characterized by high levels of CD33 and CD123, and that expression of CD33 and CD123 is directly influenced by the DNA FLT3-ITD/wild-type FLT3 allelic ratio (AR). METHODS: A total of 42 FLT3-ITD and 104 FLT3-ITD-negative AML patients were analysed. Immunophenotyping data were used to calculate antigen expression levels as the ratio between the geometric mean fluorescence intensities (MFIs) of leukemic blasts and MFIs of negative lymphocyte populations. FLT3-ITD-DNA and RNA analysis was performed, under the same conditions, by capillary electrophoresis. RESULTS: Compared with the control group, the FLT3-ITD cohort presented significantly higher CD7, CD33 and CD123 levels. In order to assess the impact of FLT3-ITD abundance on antigen expression, the patients were grouped for each parameter into two cohorts using the following threshold values: (a) 0.5 for the AR, according to current AML guidelines; (b) 0.7 for the FLT3-ITD/FLT3-WT mRNA ratio (RR); and (c) 1.3 for the FLT3-ITD RR/AR ratio. We found higher values of CD33 for RR/AR >/=1.3, and no other statistical differences between CD7, CD33 and CD123 levels of the other FLT3-ITD groups. In terms of correlations between MFI values and FLT3-ITD parameters, we only observed a moderate interdependence between CD33 MFI and the RR/AR ratio, and a weak negative correlation between CD123 MFI and AR. CONCLUSION: FLT3-ITD mutations induce a specific antigen profile in AML blasts, and our data do not onfirm previous reports of FLT3-ITD AR influencing both CD33 and CD123 expression.","['Soare, Dan-Sebastian', 'Radu, Eugen', 'Dumitru, Ion', 'Popov, Viola Maria', 'Bumbea, Horia', 'Vladareanu, Ana Maria']","['Soare DS', 'Radu E', 'Dumitru I', 'Popov VM', 'Bumbea H', 'Vladareanu AM']","['University Emergency Hospital Bucharest, Bucharest, Romania.', 'Carol Davila University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Bucharest, Romania.', 'University Emergency Hospital Bucharest, Bucharest, Romania.', 'Carol Davila University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Bucharest, Romania.', 'University Emergency Hospital Bucharest, Bucharest, Romania.', 'Carol Davila University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Bucharest, Romania.', 'Department of Hematology, Colentina Clinical Hospital, Bucharest, Romania.', 'University Emergency Hospital Bucharest, Bucharest, Romania.', 'Carol Davila University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Bucharest, Romania.', 'University Emergency Hospital Bucharest, Bucharest, Romania.', 'Carol Davila University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Bucharest, Romania.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200527,England,J Cell Mol Med,Journal of cellular and molecular medicine,101083777,"['0 (Antigens, CD7)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (CD33 protein, human)', '0 (IL3RA protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-3 Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD7/*metabolism', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'DNA/*genetics', 'Fluorescence', '*Gene Duplication', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3 Receptor alpha Subunit/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3/*metabolism', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*genetics/metabolism']",PMC7339186,['NOTNLM'],"['*AML', '*FLT3-ITD', '*MFI', '*RNA', '*allelic ratio']",2020/05/28 06:00,2021/04/29 06:00,['2020/05/28 06:00'],"['2019/11/30 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/11 00:00 [revised]', '2020/03/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/29 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/28 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/jcmm.15255 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Mol Med. 2020 Jul;24(13):7675-7679. doi: 10.1111/jcmm.15255.

In this study, we examined the effects of metformin on the activity of receptor tyrosine kinases of the TAM (TYRO3, AXL, and MERTK) family, which have important roles in leukemia cell growth. The results indicated that metformin suppressed the in vitro growth of four leukemia cell lines, OCI/AML2, OCI/AML3, THP-1, and K562, in a dose-dependent manner, which corresponded to the downregulation of the expression and phosphorylation of AXL and inhibition of its downstream targets such as phosphorylation of STAT3. Furthermore, metformin augmented the suppressive effects of a small-molecule AXL inhibitor TP-0903 on the growth of OCI/AML3 and K562 cells and prevented doxorubicin-induced AXL activation in K562 cells, which induces chemoresistance in leukemia cells, thus potentiating doxorubicin anti-proliferative effects. Given that metformin also downregulated expression of TYRO3 and phosphorylation of MERTK, these findings indicate that anti-leukemic effects exerted by metformin could be partly due to the inhibition of TAM kinases. Thus, metformin has a clinical potential for patients with leukemia cells positive for AXL and the other TAM proteins as well as activated mTOR.","['Saito, Tatsuya', 'Itoh, Mai', 'Tohda, Shuji']","['Saito T', 'Itoh M', 'Tohda S']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Yushima 1-5-45, Bunkyo-Ku, Tokyo 113-8519, Japan.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Yushima 1-5-45, Bunkyo-Ku, Tokyo 113-8519, Japan.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Yushima 1-5-45, Bunkyo-Ku, Tokyo 113-8519, Japan.

To identify key dependencies of AML stem cells in vivo, here we use a CRISPR-Cas9 screen targeting cell surface genes in a syngeneic MLL-AF9 AML mouse model and show that CXCR4 is a top cell surface regulator of AML cell growth and survival. Deletion of Cxcr4 in AML cells eradicates leukemia cells in vivo without impairing their homing to the bone marrow. In contrast, the CXCR4 ligand CXCL12 is dispensable for leukemia development in recipient mice. Moreover, expression of mutated Cxcr4 variants reveals that CXCR4 signaling is essential for leukemia cells. Notably, loss of CXCR4 signaling in leukemia cells leads to oxidative stress and differentiation in vivo. Taken together, our results identify CXCR4 signaling as essential for AML stem cells by protecting them from differentiation independent of CXCL12 stimulation.","['Ramakrishnan, Ramprasad', 'Pena-Martinez, Pablo', 'Agarwal, Puneet', 'Rodriguez-Zabala, Maria', 'Chapellier, Marion', 'Hogberg, Carl', 'Eriksson, Mia', 'Yudovich, David', 'Shah, Mansi', 'Ehinger, Mats', 'Nilsson, Bjorn', 'Larsson, Jonas', 'Hagstrom-Andersson, Anna', 'Ebert, Benjamin L', 'Bhatia, Ravi', 'Jaras, Marcus']","['Ramakrishnan R', 'Pena-Martinez P', 'Agarwal P', 'Rodriguez-Zabala M', 'Chapellier M', 'Hogberg C', 'Eriksson M', 'Yudovich D', 'Shah M', 'Ehinger M', 'Nilsson B', 'Larsson J', 'Hagstrom-Andersson A', 'Ebert BL', 'Bhatia R', 'Jaras M']","['Division of Clinical Genetics, Lund University, Lund 22184, Sweden.', 'Division of Clinical Genetics, Lund University, Lund 22184, Sweden.', 'Division of Hematology & Oncology, University of Alabama Birmingham, Birmingham, AL 35233, USA.', 'Division of Clinical Genetics, Lund University, Lund 22184, Sweden.', 'Division of Clinical Genetics, Lund University, Lund 22184, Sweden.', 'Division of Clinical Genetics, Lund University, Lund 22184, Sweden.', 'Division of Clinical Genetics, Lund University, Lund 22184, Sweden.', 'Division of Molecular Medicine and Gene Therapy, Lund University, Lund 22184, Sweden.', 'Division of Hematology & Oncology, University of Alabama Birmingham, Birmingham, AL 35233, USA.', 'Division of Pathology, Department of Clinical Sciences, Skane University Hospital, Lund University, Lund 22184, Sweden.', 'Division of Hematology and Transfusion Medicine, Lund University, Lund 22184, Sweden.', 'Division of Molecular Medicine and Gene Therapy, Lund University, Lund 22184, Sweden.', 'Division of Clinical Genetics, Lund University, Lund 22184, Sweden.', ""Division of Hematology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA 02115, USA."", 'Division of Hematology & Oncology, University of Alabama Birmingham, Birmingham, AL 35233, USA.', 'Division of Clinical Genetics, Lund University, Lund 22184, Sweden.

The t(8;21) translocation generates the aberrant transcription factor RUNX1-ETO (RUNX1-RUNX1T1), which by itself is insufficient to cause disease. t(8;21) AML patients show extensive chromatin reprogramming and have acquired additional mutations. Therefore, the genomic and developmental effects directly and solely attributable to RUNX1-ETO expression are unclear. To address this, we employ a human embryonic stem cell differentiation system capable of forming definitive myeloid progenitor cells to express RUNX1-ETO in an inducible fashion. Induction of RUNX1-ETO causes extensive chromatin reprogramming by interfering with RUNX1 binding, blocks differentiation, and arrests cellular growth, whereby growth arrest is reversible following RUNX1-ETO removal. Single-cell gene expression analyses show that RUNX1-ETO induction alters the differentiation of early myeloid progenitors, but not of other progenitor types, indicating that oncoprotein-mediated transcriptional reprogramming is highly target cell specific.","['Nafria, Monica', 'Keane, Peter', 'Ng, Elizabeth S', 'Stanley, Edouard G', 'Elefanty, Andrew G', 'Bonifer, Constanze']","['Nafria M', 'Keane P', 'Ng ES', 'Stanley EG', 'Elefanty AG', 'Bonifer C']","[""Institute for Cancer and Genomic Sciences, College of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Birmingham, Birmingham B15 2TT, UK; Murdoch Children's Research Institute, The Royal Children's Hospital, Flemington Road, Parkville, VIC 3052, Australia; Department of Paediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Dentistry and Health Sciences, University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC 3052, Australia."", 'Institute for Cancer and Genomic Sciences, College of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Birmingham, Birmingham B15 2TT, UK.', ""Murdoch Children's Research Institute, The Royal Children's Hospital, Flemington Road, Parkville, VIC 3052, Australia."", ""Murdoch Children's Research Institute, The Royal Children's Hospital, Flemington Road, Parkville, VIC 3052, Australia; Department of Paediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Dentistry and Health Sciences, University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC 3052, Australia; Department of Anatomy and Developmental Biology, Monash University, Clayton, VIC 3800, Australia."", ""Murdoch Children's Research Institute, The Royal Children's Hospital, Flemington Road, Parkville, VIC 3052, Australia; Department of Paediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Dentistry and Health Sciences, University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC 3052, Australia; Department of Anatomy and Developmental Biology, Monash University, Clayton, VIC 3800, Australia.

Interferon-gamma release assays rely on the fact that T-lymphocytes release this cytokine when exposed to tuberculosis-specific antigens and are useful in testing for latent tuberculosis infection before initiating biologic therapy, such as anti-tumor necrosis factor agents. However, the reliability of interferon-gamma release assays in detecting tuberculosis infection among HTLV-1-positive patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) remains unclear. The present study aimed to evaluate the use of the T-SPOT.TB assay in HTLV-1-positive RA patients. METHODS: Overall, 29 HTLV-1-positive RA patients and 87 age- and sex-matched HTLV-1-negative RA patients (controls) were included from the HTLV-1 RA Miyazaki Cohort Study. Results of the T-SPOT.TB assay for latent tuberculosis infection screening were collected from medical records of patients. RESULTS: Approximately 55% of the HTLV-1-positive RA patients showed invalid T-SPOT.TB assay results (odds ratio: 108, 95% confidence interval: 13.1-890, p < 0.0001) owing to a spot count of >10 in the negative controls.

METHODS: Eligible patients, aged >/= 18 years with R/R CLL, were randomly assigned 1:1 centrally and stratified by del(17p) status, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status score, and number of prior lines of therapy. Patients received acalabrutinib monotherapy or investigator's choice (idelalisib plus rituximab [I-R] or bendamustine plus rituximab [B-R]). The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS) assessed by an independent review committee (IRC) in the intent-to-treat population. Key secondary end points included IRC-assessed overall response rate, overall survival, and safety. RESULTS: From February 21, 2017, to January 17, 2018, a total of 398 patients were assessed for eligibility; 310 patients were randomly assigned to acalabrutinib monotherapy (n = 155) or investigator's choice (n = 155; I-R, n = 119; B-R, n = 36). Patients had received a median of two prior therapies (range, 1-10). After a median follow-up of 16.1 months (range, 0.03-22.4 months), median PFS was significantly longer with acalabrutinib monotherapy (PFS not reached) compared with investigator's choice (16.5 months [95% CI, 14.0 to 17.1 months]; hazard ratio, 0.31 [95% CI, 0.20 to 0.49]; P < .0001). Estimated 12-month PFS was 88% (95% CI, 81% to 92%) for acalabrutinib and 68% (95% CI, 59% to 75%) for investigator's choice. Serious adverse events occurred in 29% of patients (n = 44 of 154) treated with acalabrutinib monotherapy, 56% (n = 66 of 118) with I-R, and 26% (n = 9 of 35) with B-R. Deaths occurred in 10% (n = 15 of 154), 11% (n = 13 of 118), and 14% (n = 5 of 35) of patients receiving acalabrutinib monotherapy, I-R, and B-R, respectively. CONCLUSION: Acalabrutinib significantly improved PFS compared with I-R or B-R and has an acceptable safety profile in patients with R/R CLL.","['Ghia, Paolo', 'Pluta, Andrzej', 'Wach, Malgorzata', 'Lysak, Daniel', 'Kozak, Tomas', 'Simkovic, Martin', 'Kaplan, Polina', 'Kraychok, Iryna', 'Illes, Arpad', 'de la Serna, Javier', 'Dolan, Sean', 'Campbell, Phillip', 'Musuraca, Gerardo', 'Jacob, Abraham', 'Avery, Eric', 'Lee, Jae Hoon', 'Liang, Wei', 'Patel, Priti', 'Quah, Cheng', 'Jurczak, Wojciech']","['Ghia P', 'Pluta A', 'Wach M', 'Lysak D', 'Kozak T', 'Simkovic M', 'Kaplan P', 'Kraychok I', 'Illes A', 'de la Serna J', 'Dolan S', 'Campbell P', 'Musuraca G', 'Jacob A', 'Avery E', 'Lee JH', 'Liang W', 'Patel P', 'Quah C', 'Jurczak W']","['Universita Vita-Salute San Raffaele, Milano, Italy.', 'Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico Ospedale San Raffaele, Milano, Italy.', 'Szpital Specjalistyczny w Brzozowie im.

METHODS: Recommendations were developed by an international multidisciplinary panel that included a patient advocate. We conducted a systematic review of systemic antifungal prophylaxis in children and adults with cancer and HSCT recipients. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach was used to make strong or weak recommendations and to classify level of evidence as high, moderate, low, or very low. The panel considered directness of the data to pediatric patients. RESULTS: There were 68 randomized trials included in the systematic review, of which 6 (9%) were conducted in a solely pediatric population. Strong recommendations were made to administer systemic antifungal prophylaxis to children and adolescents receiving treatment of acute myeloid leukemia, to those undergoing allogeneic HSCT pre-engraftment, and to those receiving systemic immunosuppression for graft-versus-host disease treatment. A strong recommendation was made to administer a mold-active agent with an echinocandin or a mold-active azole when systemic antifungal prophylaxis is warranted. For children younger than 13 years of age, an echinocandin, voriconazole, or itraconazole is suggested. Posaconazole may also be used in those age 13 years or older. A strong recommendation against routine administration of amphotericin as systemic antifungal prophylaxis was made. CONCLUSION: We developed a clinical practice guideline for systemic antifungal prophylaxis administration in pediatric patients with cancer and HSCT recipients. Implementation and assessment of guideline-concordant rates and impacts are important future steps.","['Lehrnbecher, Thomas', 'Fisher, Brian T', 'Phillips, Bob', 'Beauchemin, Melissa', 'Carlesse, Fabianne', 'Castagnola, Elio', 'Duong, Nathan', 'Dupuis, L Lee', 'Fioravantti, Vicky', 'Groll, Andreas H', 'Haeusler, Gabrielle M', 'Roilides, Emmanuel', 'Science, Michelle', 'Steinbach, William J', 'Tissing, Wim', 'Warris, Adilia', 'Patel, Priya', 'Robinson, Paula D', 'Sung, Lillian']","['Lehrnbecher T', 'Fisher BT', 'Phillips B', 'Beauchemin M', 'Carlesse F', 'Castagnola E', 'Duong N', 'Dupuis LL', 'Fioravantti V', 'Groll AH', 'Haeusler GM', 'Roilides E', 'Science M', 'Steinbach WJ', 'Tissing W', 'Warris A', 'Patel P', 'Robinson PD', 'Sung L']","['Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Hospital for Children and Adolescents, University Hospital, Johann Wolfgang Goethe University, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', ""Division of Infectious Diseases, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA."", 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Leeds Teaching Hospital, National Health Service Trust, Leeds, United Kingdom.', 'Centre for Reviews and Dissemination, University of York, Leeds, United Kingdom.', 'Columbia University/Herbert Irving Cancer Center, Pediatric Oncology, New York, NY.', 'Pediatric Oncology Institute, GRAACC/Federal University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Infectious Diseases Unit, Department of Pediatrics, Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico, Istituto Giannina Gaslini, Genova, Italy.', 'Medical Oncology and Hematology, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Child Health Evaluative Sciences, Research Institute, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Pharmacy, The Hospital for Sick Children, and Leslie Dan Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', ""Infectious Disease Research Program, Center for Bone Marrow Transplantation, Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, University Children's Hospital, Muenster, Germany."", ""Department of Infectious Diseases, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre and Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne, and National Health and Medical Research Council, National Centre for Infections in Cancer, Sir Peter MacCallum Department of Oncology, University of Melbourne, Parkville, Victoria, Australia."", 'Infectious Diseases Unit, Third Department of Pediatrics, Aristotle, University School of Health Sciences, Hippokration General Hospital, Thessaloniki, Greece.', 'Division of Infectious Diseases, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Division of Pediatric Infectious Diseases, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Princess Maxima Centre, Utrecht, and Department of Pediatric Oncology, University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, the Netherlands.', 'Medical Research Council Center for Medical Mycology, University of Exeter, Exeter, and Great Ormond Street Hospital, London, United Kingdom.', 'Pediatric Oncology Group of Ontario, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Pediatric Oncology Group of Ontario, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Child Health Evaluative Sciences, Research Institute, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', 'G0800472/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'MR/N006364/2/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'PDF-2014-07-072/DH_/Department of Health/United Kingdom', '097377/WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom']","['Journal Article', 'Practice Guideline', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200527,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,['0 (Antifungal Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', '*Antibiotic Prophylaxis', 'Antifungal Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppression Therapy', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Invasive Fungal Infections/*prevention & control', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Patient Selection', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'Systematic Reviews as Topic', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",PMC7499615,,,2020/05/28 06:00,2021/03/03 06:00,['2020/05/28 06:00'],"['2020/05/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/03 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/28 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.20.00158 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2020 Sep 20;38(27):3205-3216. doi: 10.1200/JCO.20.00158.

Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) is the only curative treatment for JMML. Pre-transplant therapy is a matter of controversy, and there are no firm recommendations. Whether chemotherapy is effective in achieving durable remission is questionable. Patients diagnosed as JMML at our center from January-2014 to December-2019 were retrospectively analyzed. All patients treated with at least one cycle of sequential therapy with subcutaneous cytarabine and oral 6-mercaptopurine were further assessed. The total number of patients diagnosed during the study period was 33. Patients were divided into two groups: patients who did not get any chemotherapy (n = 13) and ones who received at least one cycle of chemotherapy(n = 20). Age, total leukocyte count (TLC), monocyte percent, platelet count and spleen size were comparable between the two groups. There was no difference in the overall survival between the two groups, but 6 out of 20 patients showed a response to chemotherapy (2 complete remission, 4 partial remission). Two patients out of 20 underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). The patients who achieved complete remission received 12 cycles of chemotherapy and have been in follow up for 28 months and 50 months respectively. Our results showed that sequential therapy with 6-mercaptopurine and cytarabine may be offered to patients in whom HSCT is not feasible or as a bridge therapy in those awaiting HSCT. The advantages of this approach include low cost, out-patient management and decreased requirement of blood components. In a subset of patients it may achieve remission.","['Wajid M, Abdul', 'Gupta, Aditya Kumar', 'Das, Gargi', 'Sahoo, Debasish', 'Meena, Jagdish Prasad', 'Seth, Rachna']","['Wajid M A', 'Gupta AK', 'Das G', 'Sahoo D', 'Meena JP', 'Seth R']","['Division of Pediatric Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi.', 'Division of Pediatric Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi.', 'Division of Pediatric Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi.', 'Division of Pediatric Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi.', 'Division of Pediatric Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi.', 'Division of Pediatric Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200527,England,Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Pediatric hematology and oncology,8700164,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytarabine/*administration & dosage', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/methods', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Juvenile/*drug therapy', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Mercaptopurine/*administration & dosage', 'Platelet Count', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Spleen', 'Treatment Outcome']",,['NOTNLM'],"['6-mercaptopurine', 'Cytarabine', 'Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia']",2020/05/28 06:00,2021/01/27 06:00,['2020/05/28 06:00'],"['2020/05/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/27 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/28 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/08880018.2020.1767244 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2020 Oct;37(7):573-581. doi: 10.1080/08880018.2020.1767244.

However, leukemia relapse after allograft restricts the improvement of transplant outcomes. Measurable residual disease (MRD) has been the strongest predictor for relapse after allo-HSCT, allowing MRD-directed preemptive therapy. AREAS COVERED: This manuscript summarizes the detection of MRD in patients with ALL who undergo allo-HSCT, focusing the effects of positive pre-HSCT MRD and post-HSCT MRD on outcomes as well as MRD-directed interventions. EXPERT OPINION: Except for MFC and RQ-PCR, other strategies, such as next-generation sequencing and RNAseq, have been developed for MRD determination. Negative effects of positive MRD peri-transplantation on outcomes of ALL patients were observed both in human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched sibling donor transplantation and in alternative donor transplantation. Advances have been made in determining the need for transplant according to MRD evaluation after induction or consolidation therapy. A number of approaches, including CAR-T-cell therapy, antibodies (blinatumomab, etc), targeted therapy (imatinib, etc), transplant donor selection, as well as donor lymphocyte infusion and interferon-alpha, have been successfully used or are promising for peri-transplantation MRD interventions. This progress could lead to the significant improvement of transplant outcomes for ALL patients.","['Sun, Yu-Qian', 'Li, Si-Qi', 'Zhao, Xiao-Su', 'Chang, Ying-Jun']","['Sun YQ', 'Li SQ', 'Zhao XS', 'Chang YJ']","[""National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Disease, Peking University People's Hospital & Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation , Beijing, P.R.C."", ""National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Disease, Peking University People's Hospital & Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation , Beijing, P.R.C."", ""National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Disease, Peking University People's Hospital & Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation , Beijing, P.R.C."", ""National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Disease, Peking University People's Hospital & Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation , Beijing, P.R.C.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20200527,England,Expert Rev Anticancer Ther,Expert review of anticancer therapy,101123358,,IM,"['Adult', 'Allografts', 'Donor Selection', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', '*Neoplasm, Residual', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/pathology/*therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Measurable/minimal residual disease', '*acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*allogeneic stem cell transplantation', '*flow cytometry', '*haploidentical transplantation', '*intervention', '*next-generation sequencing', '*real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction']",2020/05/28 06:00,2021/04/07 06:00,['2020/05/28 06:00'],"['2020/05/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/07 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/28 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/14737140.2020.1766973 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Rev Anticancer Ther. 2020 Jun;20(6):453-464. doi: 10.1080/14737140.2020.1766973.

In clinical practice, tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) dose reductions can be considered a means of preventing adverse effects and improving quality of life. We hypothesized that administration of low-dose TKIs before treatment discontinuation does not impair TFR in patients with CML who have a deep molecular response (DMR, >/=MR(4) ). METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of 77 patients with CML who discontinued treatment with TKIs. Twenty-six patients had been managed with low-dose TKIs before stopping treatment. Patients were to be exposed to TKIs for >/=5 years and to low-dose TKIs for >/=1 year and in DMR for >/=2 years. The loss of major molecular response (MMR) was considered a trigger for restarting therapy. RESULTS: In the low-dose group, 61.5% of patients received second-generation TKIs, and dose reduction was >/=50% for 65.4% of patients. With a median follow-up of 61.5 months, TFR at 12 months was 56.8% in the full-dose TKI group and 80.8% in the low-dose group, and TFR at 60 months was 47.5% and 58.8%, respectively. The median time to molecular recurrence (>/=MMR) from TKI discontinuation in the entire cohort was 6.2 months. All patients quickly achieved MMR after resuming TKI therapy. Results appear independent of both dose reduction and potential pretreatment with interferon-alpha. CONCLUSION: This retrospective study shows that TFR was not impaired by low-dose TKI regimens before TKI cessation in Patients with CML. Nevertheless, prospective randomized clinical trials must be undertaken to analyze the probability of successful TFR in patients managed with TKI dose de-escalation strategies before TKI discontinuation.","['Cayssials, Emilie', 'Torregrosa-Diaz, Jose', 'Gallego-Hernanz, Pilar', 'Tartarin, Florence', 'Systchenko, Thomas', 'Maillard, Natacha', 'Desmier, Deborah', 'Machet, Antoine', 'Fleck, Emmanuel', 'Corby, Anne', 'Motard, Carine', 'Denis, Guillaume', 'Herbelin, Andre', 'Gombert, Jean-Marc', 'Roy, Lydia', 'Ragot, Stephanie', 'Leleu, Xavier', 'Guilhot, Francois', 'Chomel, Jean-Claude']","['Cayssials E', 'Torregrosa-Diaz J', 'Gallego-Hernanz P', 'Tartarin F', 'Systchenko T', 'Maillard N', 'Desmier D', 'Machet A', 'Fleck E', 'Corby A', 'Motard C', 'Denis G', 'Herbelin A', 'Gombert JM', 'Roy L', 'Ragot S', 'Leleu X', 'Guilhot F', 'Chomel JC']","[""Service d'Oncologie Hematologique et Therapie Cellulaire, CHU Poitiers, Poitiers, France."", 'INSERM CIC 1402, CHU Poitiers, Poitiers, France.', 'INSERM 1082, Poitiers, France.', ""Service d'Oncologie Hematologique et Therapie Cellulaire, CHU Poitiers, Poitiers, France."", 'INSERM CIC 1402, CHU Poitiers, Poitiers, France.', ""Service d'Oncologie Hematologique et Therapie Cellulaire, CHU Poitiers, Poitiers, France."", 'INSERM CIC 1402, CHU Poitiers, Poitiers, France.', ""Service d'Oncologie Hematologique et Therapie Cellulaire, CHU Poitiers, Poitiers, France."", ""Service d'Oncologie Hematologique et Therapie Cellulaire, CHU Poitiers, Poitiers, France."", ""Service d'Oncologie Hematologique et Therapie Cellulaire, CHU Poitiers, Poitiers, France."", ""Service d'Oncologie Hematologique et Therapie Cellulaire, CHU Poitiers, Poitiers, France."", ""Service d'Oncologie Hematologique, CH La Rochelle, La Rochelle, France."", ""Service d'Oncologie Hematologique, CH La Rochelle, La Rochelle, France."", ""Service d'Hematologie, CH Niort, Niort, France."", ""Service d'Hematologie, CH Rochefort, Rochefort, France."", 'INSERM 1082, Poitiers, France.', 'INSERM 1082, Poitiers, France.', ""Service Clinique d'Hematologie, Hopital Henri-Mondor, Creteil, France."", 'INSERM CIC 1402, CHU Poitiers, Poitiers, France.', ""Service d'Oncologie Hematologique et Therapie Cellulaire, CHU Poitiers, Poitiers, France."", 'INSERM CIC 1402, CHU Poitiers, Poitiers, France.', 'INSERM CIC 1402, CHU Poitiers, Poitiers, France.', 'Service de Cancerologie Biologique, CHU Poitiers, Poitiers, France.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200527,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/epidemiology/genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', '*Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*TKI de-escalation', '*chronic myeloid leukemia', '*treatment discontinuation', '*treatment-free remission', '*tyrosine kinase inhibitors']",2020/05/28 06:00,2021/05/21 06:00,['2020/05/28 06:00'],"['2020/01/13 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/17 00:00 [revised]', '2020/04/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/21 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/28 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.32940 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2020 Aug 1;126(15):3438-3447. doi: 10.1002/cncr.32940.

Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) has recently emerged as a common, potent, age-associated, independent risk factor for myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure events, and survival following percutaneous aortic valve intervention. The presence of CHIP results from the acquisition of somatic mutations in a small number of leukemia driver genes found in bone marrow stem cells, leading to the expansion of leukocytes clones in peripheral blood. The association between CHIP and cardiovascular disease likely involves activation of the inflammasome pathway. More common DNA sequencing identifies individuals with CHIP who then seek advice regarding management of their cardiovascular risk. Observations: Using clinical vignettes based on real encounters, we highlight some of the diverse presentations of CHIP, ranging from incidental identification to that detected during cancer care, that have brought patients to the attention of cardiovascular practitioners. We illustrate how we have applied a consensus-based approach to the evaluation and management of cardiovascular risk in specific patients with CHIP. Since we currently lack evidence to guide the management of these individuals, we must rely on expert opinion while awaiting data to furnish a firmer foundation for our recommendations. Conclusions and Relevance: These vignettes illustrate that the management of CHIP should involve an individualized plan based on features such as comorbidities, life expectancy, and other traditional cardiovascular risk factors. Because individuals with CHIP will increasingly seek advice from cardiovascular specialists regarding management, these examples provide a template for approaches based on a multidisciplinary perspective. The current need for reliance on expert opinion illustrates a great need for further investigation into the management of this newly recognized contributor to residual cardiovascular risk, both in patients who are apparently well and those with established cardiovascular or malignant disease.","['Sidlow, Robert', 'Lin, Amy E', 'Gupta, Dipti', 'Bolton, Kelly L', 'Steensma, David P', 'Levine, Ross L', 'Ebert, Benjamin L', 'Libby, Peter']","['Sidlow R', 'Lin AE', 'Gupta D', 'Bolton KL', 'Steensma DP', 'Levine RL', 'Ebert BL', 'Libby P']","['Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, New York.', ""Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts."", 'Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, New York.', 'Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, New York.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, New York.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.', ""Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts.""]",['eng'],"['R01 HL080472/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,JAMA Cardiol,JAMA cardiology,101676033,,IM,"['Cardiovascular Diseases/*etiology/prevention & control', '*Clonal Hematopoiesis', '*Heart Disease Risk Factors', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Risk Factors']",,,,2020/05/28 06:00,2022/01/05 06:00,['2020/05/28 06:00'],"['2020/05/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/05 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/28 06:00 [entrez]']","['2766533 [pii]', '10.1001/jamacardio.2020.1271 [doi]']",ppublish,JAMA Cardiol. 2020 Aug 1;5(8):958-961. doi: 10.1001/jamacardio.2020.1271.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We aimed to investigate the potential mechanisms of drug resistance in adults with T-LBL. METHODS: Gene expression microarray was used to identify differential mRNA expression profiles between chemotherapy-resistant and chemotherapy-sensitive adult T-LBL tissues. Real-time PCR and immunohistochemistry were performed to detect the expression of bromodomain-containing protein 2 (BRD2) and c-Myc in fresh-frozen T-LBL tissues from 85 adult patients. The Ras pull-down assay was performed to monitor Ras activation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were used to analyze the binding of E2F transcription factor 1 (E2F1)/BRD2 to the RAS guanyl releasing protein 1 (RasGRP1) promoter region. The drug resistance effect and mechanism of BRD2 were determined by both in vivo and in vitro studies. RESULTS: A total of 86 chemotherapy resistance-related genes in adult T-LBL were identified by gene expression microarray. Among them, BRD2 was upregulated in chemotherapy-resistant adult T-LBL tissues and associated with worse progression-free survival and overall survival of 85 adult T-LBL patients. Furthermore, BRD2 suppressed doxorubicin (Dox)-induced cell apoptosis both in vitro and in vivo. The activation of RasGRP1/Ras/ERK signaling might contribute to the Dox resistance effect of BRD2. Besides, OTX015, a bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) inhibitor, reversed the Dox resistance effect of BRD2. Patient-derived tumor xenograft demonstrated that the sequential use of OTX015 after Dox showed superior therapeutic effects. CONCLUSIONS: Our data showed that BRD2 promotes drug resistance in adult T-LBL through the RasGRP1/Ras/ERK signaling pathway. Targeting BRD2 may be a novel strategy to improve the therapeutic efficacy and prolong survival of adults with T-LBL.","['Tian, Xiao-Peng', 'Cai, Jun', 'Ma, Shu-Yun', 'Fang, Yu', 'Huang, Hui-Qiang', 'Lin, Tong-Yu', 'Rao, Hui-Lan', 'Li, Mei', 'Xia, Zhong-Jun', 'Kang, Tie-Bang', 'Xie, Dan', 'Cai, Qing-Qing']","['Tian XP', 'Cai J', 'Ma SY', 'Fang Y', 'Huang HQ', 'Lin TY', 'Rao HL', 'Li M', 'Xia ZJ', 'Kang TB', 'Xie D', 'Cai QQ']","['State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 510060, P.

METHODS: We collected the data of 686 acute leukemia patients who received only one allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in our center from 2008 to 2017. Patients were divided into four groups (underweight, normal weight, overweight and obesity) according to their body mass index pre-hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. RESULTS: 56.4% of patients had normal body mass indices, 17.3% were underweight, 20.4% were overweight and 5.8% were with obesity. Concerning long-term follow-up, the probability of overall survival was significantly lower in overweight (P = 0.010) and patients with obesity (P = 0.065) as compared with normal weight patients, and no statistically significant difference between underweight and normal weight individuals (P = 0.810). The results demonstrated that higher body mass index was associated with poorer overall survival (hazard ratio: 1.79; 95% confidence interval: 1.33-2.40, P < 0.001) and shorter leukemia-free survival (hazard ratio: 1.78; 95% confidence interval: 1.35-2.34, P < 0.001). Additionally, patients exhibiting a higher body mass index were more likely to face the problem of relapse (30.6 vs 20.9%, P < 0.001). Furthermore, non-relapse mortality of patients with obesity was statistically higher than normal weight patients (22.5 vs 9.6%, P = 0.027). Besides, individuals with a higher abdominal girth had shorter survival (hazard ratio: 1.73; 95% confidence interval: 1.29-2.31, P < 0.001) and higher relapse rate (hazard ratio: 1.78; 95% confidence interval: 1.29-2.45, P = 0.001) as compared with those with a lower abdominal girth. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that obesity at pre-hematopoietic stem cell transplantation stage, whether characterized by higher body mass index or abdominal girth, is correlated with poorer outcome.","['Yu, Jian', 'Lin, Shangnao', 'Luo, Yi', 'Shi, Jimin', 'Tan, Yamin', 'Lai, Xiaoyu', 'Zhao, Yanmin', 'Ye, Yishan', 'Zhu, Yuanyuan', 'Zheng, Weiyan', 'Huang, He']","['Yu J', 'Lin S', 'Luo Y', 'Shi J', 'Tan Y', 'Lai X', 'Zhao Y', 'Ye Y', 'Zhu Y', 'Zheng W', 'Huang H']","[""Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Institute of Hematology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, People's Republic of China."", ""Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Institute of Hematology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, People's Republic of China."", ""Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Institute of Hematology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, People's Republic of China."", ""Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Institute of Hematology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, People's Republic of China."", ""Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Institute of Hematology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, People's Republic of China."", ""Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Institute of Hematology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, People's Republic of China."", ""Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Institute of Hematology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, People's Republic of China."", ""Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Institute of Hematology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, People's Republic of China."", ""Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Institute of Hematology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, People's Republic of China."", ""Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Institute of Hematology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, People's Republic of China."", ""Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Institute of Hematology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,England,Jpn J Clin Oncol,Japanese journal of clinical oncology,0313225,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/mortality', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*complications/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/pathology', 'Obesity/*complications', 'Overweight/complications', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Thinness/complications', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",,['NOTNLM'],"['abdominal girth', 'acute leukemia', 'allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', 'body mass index']",2020/05/28 06:00,2020/09/18 06:00,['2020/05/28 06:00'],"['2020/03/02 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/18 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/28 06:00 [entrez]']","['5847610 [pii]', '10.1093/jjco/hyaa053 [doi]']",ppublish,Jpn J Clin Oncol. 2020 Aug 4;50(8):889-896. doi: 10.1093/jjco/hyaa053.,,,"['(c) The Author(s) 2020.

The aim of the present study is to investigate the incidence and mortality of leukemia in children aged 0-14 years and its relationship with Human Development Index (HDI in different countries of the world. Methods: Incidence and mortality rates were obtained from GLOBOCAN and Country's income from World Bank. The data analysis was conducted using correlation analysis. The association of incidence and mortality rates with HDI was investigated using linear regression models. RESULTS: The results revealed a significant positive correlation between the incidence rate and Gross National Income per capita (r = 0.464, P <0.0001), mean years of schooling (r = 0.566, P <0.0001), life expectancy at birth (r = 0.712, P <0.0001) and expected years of schooling (r = 0.604, P <0.0001). The results also demonstrated a positive and significant correlation between mortality rate and life expectancy at birth (r = 0.199, P <0.0001). An improvement in HDI [Beta = 7.7, CI95% (0.1, 15.3)] and life Expectancy at birth [Beta = 0.1, CI95% (0.03, 0.1)] caused a significantly rise in the incidence of leukemia. Moreover, the improved HDI [Beta = 6.2, CI95% (1.9, 10.5)] was associated with increased mean years of schooling [Beta = -0.1, CI95% (-0.2, -0.01)] and expected years of schooling [Beta = -0.1, CI95% (-0.3, -0.08).

We herein, evaluate the prevalence and the prognostic significance of neurogenic locus notch homolog protein-1 (NOTCH1) mutations in B- cell lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL). METHODS: A cohort of 105 Egyptian B-CLL patients aging from 43 to 86 years. PCR products including NOTCH1 exon 26, 27, and distal part of exon 34 expanding the sequences encoding transcription activation domain (TAD) and a peptide sequence rich in proline (P), glutamic acid (E), serine (S), threonine (T) (PEST domains) were sequenced by direct DNA Sanger sequencing. RESULTS: NOTCH1 mutations were detected in 48/105 of patients (45.7%). Mutations in B-CLL patients are insertions (n=21), point mutations (n=18) and deletions (n=12). NOTCH1 mutations showed significant impact on prognosis of B-CLL patients as they were associated with increased bone marrow lymphocytes, more relapse and high incidence of mortality, shortened overall survival and progression free survival, and lymphocytes doubling time, when compared with NOTCH1 wild type B-CLL patients (P= 0.001; 0,005; 0.042; 0.049; 0.008; 0.049 respectively). CONCLUSION: NOTCH1 mutations were considered as bad prognostic marker in B-CLL and suggested to be included in risk stratification of B-CLL patients at diagnosis.","['Aref, Salah', 'El-Agder, Mohamed', 'Salama, Osama', 'Abouzeid, Tarek', 'Sabry, Mohamed']","['Aref S', 'El-Agder M', 'Salama O', 'Abouzeid T', 'Sabry M']","['Hematology Unit, Clinical Pathology Department, Mansoura Faculty of Medicine, Mansoura University, Egypt.', 'Hematology Unit, Clinical Pathology Department, Mansoura Faculty of Medicine, Mansoura University, Egypt.', 'Hematology Unit, Clinical Pathology Department, Mansoura Faculty of Medicine, Mansoura University, Egypt.', 'Hematology Unit, Internal Medicine Department, Mansoura University Oncology Center, Mansoura Faculty of Medicine, Mansoura, Egypt..', 'Hematology Unit, Clinical Pathology Department, Mansoura Faculty of Medicine, Mansoura University, Egypt.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200501,Thailand,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,101130625,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (NOTCH1 protein, human)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'Cohort Studies', 'Egypt', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*diagnosis/drug therapy/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Prognosis', 'Receptor, Notch1/*genetics', 'Survival Rate']",PMC7541881,['NOTNLM'],"['CLL, NOTCH1', 'Prognosis', 'mutations']",2020/05/28 06:00,2021/02/07 06:00,['2020/05/28 06:00'],"['2019/10/18 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/05/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.31557/APJCP.2020.21.5.1295 [doi]'],epublish,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev. 2020 May 1;21(5):1295-1301. doi: 10.31557/APJCP.2020.21.5.1295.,['ORCID: 0000-0002-4822-5204'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A total of 94 AML patients were enrolled in the study, of whom 46 were treated with HCAG chemotherapy, while 48 were treated with CAG chemotherapy. RESULT: The complete remission (CR) was 39.6% in the patients with HCAG, while the CR was 33.3% in the CAG group. The overall remission (ORR) was 63.0% and 43.5% in patients of the HCAG and CAG groups, respectively (P = 0.038). The median survival time of progression free survival (PFS) was 8.0 (95% CI 3.843-10.157) months in the HCAG group and 7.0 (95% CI 2.682-13.318) months in the CAG group (P = 0.032). A total of 31 patients in the HCAG group suffered from grade 4 hematological toxicity, whereas 29 patients were treated with CAG (P = 0.622). A total of 27 (58.7%) cases indicated apparent pulmonary infection in the HCAG group, while 25 (52.1%) were noted with this complication in the CAG group (P = 0.519). Oral cavity toxicity was evident for 13 (28.3%) and 11 (23.0%) cases in the HCAG and CAG groups, respectively (P = 0.216). CONCLUSION: The HCAG regimen was more effective than the CAG regimen in elderly low- and intermediate-risk group patients diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia although the HCAG regimen exhibited similar toxicity with that of the CAG group.","['Zhang, J Y', 'Li, L', 'Liu, W', 'Jin, Y', 'Zhao, M', 'Zhou, Y', 'Fan, Z']","['Zhang JY', 'Li L', 'Liu W', 'Jin Y', 'Zhao M', 'Zhou Y', 'Fan Z']","['Lishui Municipal Central Hospital, Lishui, Zhejiang, China.', 'Lishui Municipal Central Hospital, Lishui, Zhejiang, China. lilinjie0394@163.com.', 'Lishui Municipal Central Hospital, Lishui, Zhejiang, China.', 'Lishui Municipal Central Hospital, Lishui, Zhejiang, China.', 'Lishui Municipal Central Hospital, Lishui, Zhejiang, China.', 'Lishui Municipal Central Hospital, Lishui, Zhejiang, China.', 'Lishui Municipal Central Hospital, Lishui, Zhejiang, China.']",['eng'],"['2020376298/Medical Health Science and Technology Project of Zhejiang Provincial', 'Health Commission']","['Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",20200526,Italy,Clin Transl Oncol,Clinical & translational oncology : official publication of the Federation of Spanish Oncology Societies and of the National Cancer Institute of Mexico,101247119,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '6FG8041S5B (Homoharringtonine)', '74KXF8I502 (Aclarubicin)', 'CAG protocol']",IM,"['Aclarubicin/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Homoharringtonine/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Induction Chemotherapy/adverse effects/*methods', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Progression-Free Survival', 'Remission Induction', 'Retreatment/methods', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Salvage Therapy', 'Single-Blind Method', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Failure']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'CAG', 'HCAG', 'Overall remission', 'Progression-free survival', 'Re-induction chemotherapy']",2020/05/28 06:00,2021/08/28 06:00,['2020/05/28 06:00'],"['2020/03/28 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/28 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/28 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12094-020-02383-x [doi]', '10.1007/s12094-020-02383-x [pii]']",ppublish,Clin Transl Oncol. 2021 Jan;23(1):48-57. doi: 10.1007/s12094-020-02383-x.

Forty eight cases:HCL(n = 34), SMZL(n = 11) and HCL-v(n = 3) were included. Of these, 32 were retrospective and 16 were prospective. DNA was extracted, in retrospective cases from cells obtained by smears from bone marrow aspirate/trephine imprint (BMA/BMTx) slides, and in prospective cases from peripheral blood (PB)/BMA samples. BRAF V600E mutation testing was done using ARMS-PCR. BRAF V600E mutation was positive in all HCL and negative in all SMZL and HCL-v cases. DNA extracted from BMA/BMTx slides gave results comparable to DNA extracted from PB/BMA samples. Median age of presentation for HCL (53 years) and SMZL (56 years) were quite similar, however, HCL-v (71 years) cases presented at an older age.

Herein, we describe a patient that presented with back pain and bilateral sciatica secondary to root compression due to epidural deposition of leukemic cells. The magnetic resonance imaging showed epidural masses, causing a slight restriction of the spinal canal with bilateral L5 root compression. Laboratory examinations showed hyperleukocytosis (white blood cell count: 83 x 109/L, absolute neutrophil count: 60 x 109/L). The bone marrow cytology and immunophenotypic findings confirmed the diagnosis of myeloid leukemia. The diagnosis of spinal myeloid sarcoma revealing chronic myeloid leukemia during the blast phase was established. The patient underwent induction chemotherapy. Then, bone marrow cytology revealed less than 3% of blasts, which correspond to cytological remission. Three months later, MRI showed complete disappearance of the epidural masses. A literature review was conducted by searching PubMed using these terms: ""Leukemia, Myeloid"" AND ""Spine"" AND ""Sarcoma, Myeloid"". We emphasize clinical and radiological findings of spinal myeloid sarcoma. This diagnosis should be considered when the MRI reveals epidural mass lesion. The early management of this disease is necessary, and the treatment of myeloid sarcoma is not codified. Our case highlighted that chemotherapy treatment could be sufficient to lead to the disappearance of myeloid sarcoma and the remission of leukemia.","['Slouma, Maroua', 'Rahmouni, Safa', 'Dhahri, Rim', 'Khayati, Yasmine', 'Zriba, Samy', 'Amorri, Wajdi', 'Gharsallah, Imen', 'Metoui, Leila', 'Louzir, Bassem']","['Slouma M', 'Rahmouni S', 'Dhahri R', 'Khayati Y', 'Zriba S', 'Amorri W', 'Gharsallah I', 'Metoui L', 'Louzir B']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Military Hospital, Tunis El Manar University, Tunis, Tunisia. maroua.slouma@gmail.com.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Military Hospital, Tunis El Manar University, Tunis, Tunisia.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Military Hospital, Tunis El Manar University, Tunis, Tunisia.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Military Hospital, Tunis El Manar University, Tunis, Tunisia.', 'Department of Hematology, Military Hospital, Tunis El Manar University, Tunis, Tunisia.', 'Department of Radiology, Military Hospital, Tunis El Manar University, Tunis, Tunisia.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Military Hospital, Tunis El Manar University, Tunis, Tunisia.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Military Hospital, Tunis El Manar University, Tunis, Tunisia.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Military Hospital, Tunis El Manar University, Tunis, Tunisia.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",20200526,Germany,Clin Rheumatol,Clinical rheumatology,8211469,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Back Pain/etiology', 'Blast Crisis/*diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Remission Induction', 'Sarcoma, Myeloid/*diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Sciatica/etiology', 'Spinal Neoplasms/*diagnosis/drug therapy']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Leukemia', 'Myeloid sarcoma', 'Spine']",2020/05/28 06:00,2021/04/10 06:00,['2020/05/28 06:00'],"['2020/04/09 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/05 00:00 [revised]', '2020/05/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/10 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/28 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s10067-020-05167-4 [doi]', '10.1007/s10067-020-05167-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Clin Rheumatol. 2020 Aug;39(8):2453-2459. doi: 10.1007/s10067-020-05167-4.

We performed a retrospective nested case-control study on patients with CNS relapse after allo-HSCT. The cumulative incidence of CNS relapse was 4.06% after allo-HSCT in ALL, with a significantly poor prognosis. The incidence was 3.91% and 5.36% in HID-HSCT and ISD-HSCT, respectively (p = .227). Among the patients with CNS relapse, the overall survival (OS) at 3 years was 56.2 +/- 6.8% in the HID-HSCT subgroup and 76.9 +/- 10.2% in the ISD-HSCT subgroup (p = .176). The 3-year cumulative incidence of systemic relapse was also comparable between the two subgroups (HID-HSCT, 40.6 +/- 7.4%; ISD-HSCT, 13.3 +/- 8.7%, respectively, p = .085). Younger age (p = .045), T-ALL (p = .035), hyperleukocytosis at diagnosis (p < .001), advanced disease stage at transplant (p < .001), pre-HSCT CNS involvement (p < .001), and absence of chronic graft vs host disease (cGVHD) (p < .001) were independent risk factors for CNS relapse after allo-HSCT. In conclusion, CNS relapse was a significant complication after allo-HSCT in ALL and was associated with poor prognosis.

Its dysregulation is associated with pathological outcomes like cancer. We previously demonstrated that downregulation of WNT7A correlates with higher proliferation rates in acute lymphoblastic leukemia. However, the regulation of this gene in pathological and normal conditions remains unexplored. In this work, we aimed to analyze the transcriptional regulation of WNT7A in leukemic cells and in normal T lymphocytes after a proliferative stimulus. WNT7A expression was measured in blood cells and in T lymphocytes after phytohemagglutinin-L (PHA-L) treatment or T-cell receptor (TCR) activation by qPCR and Western blot. Promoter methylation was assessed using methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes, and histone modifications were determined by chromatin immunoprecipitation and qPCR. In T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), WNT7A expression is silenced through DNA methylation of CpG island in the promoter region. In normal peripheral blood cells, WNT7A is mainly expressed by monocytes and T lymphocytes. TCR activation induces the downregulation of WNT7A in normal T lymphocytes by changes in histone methylation marks (H3K4me2/3) and histone deacetylases. A proliferative stimulus mediated by IL-2 keeps WNT7A expression at low levels but in the absence of IL-2, the expression of this gene tends to be restored. Furthermore, after TCR activation and WNT7A downregulation, target genes associated with the WNT canonical pathway were upregulated indicating an independent activity of WNT7A from the WNT canonical pathway. WNT7A expression is silenced by long-term DNA methylation in T-ALL-derived cells and downregulated by histone modifications after TCR activation in normal T lymphocytes.","['Barreto-Vargas, Christian', 'Alvarez-Zavala, Monserrat', 'Garcia-Chagollan, Mariel', 'Hernandez-Flores, Georgina', 'Aguilar-Lemarroy, Adriana', 'Jave-Suarez, Luis F']","['Barreto-Vargas C', 'Alvarez-Zavala M', 'Garcia-Chagollan M', 'Hernandez-Flores G', 'Aguilar-Lemarroy A', 'Jave-Suarez LF']","['Division de Inmunologia, Centro de Investigacion Biomedica de Occidente (CIBO), Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (IMSS), Sierra Mojada #800, Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico.', 'Doctorado en Ciencias Biomedicas, Centro Universitario en Ciencias de la Salud (CUCS), Universidad de Guadalajara, Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico.', 'Instituto de Investigacion en Inmunodeficiencias y VIH, Departamento de Clinicas Medicas, Universidad de Guadalajara, Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico.', 'Instituto de Investigacion en Ciencias Biomedicas (IICB), CUCS, Universidad de Guadalajara, Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico.', 'Division de Inmunologia, Centro de Investigacion Biomedica de Occidente (CIBO), Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (IMSS), Sierra Mojada #800, Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico.', 'Division de Inmunologia, Centro de Investigacion Biomedica de Occidente (CIBO), Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (IMSS), Sierra Mojada #800, Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico.', 'Division de Inmunologia, Centro de Investigacion Biomedica de Occidente (CIBO), Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (IMSS), Sierra Mojada #800, Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico. lfjave@yahoo.com.']",['eng'],"['FIS/IMSS/PROT/G13/1243/Fondo de Investigacion en Salud, IMSS', 'FIS/IMSS/PROT/G14/1316/Fondo de Investigacion en Salud, IMSS']",['Journal Article'],20200526,Switzerland,Arch Immunol Ther Exp (Warsz),Archivum immunologiae et therapiae experimentalis,0114365,"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (WNT7A protein, human)', '0 (Wnt Proteins)']",IM,"['Cell Proliferation', 'DNA Methylation', 'Down-Regulation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Histone Code', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/metabolism', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Wnt Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Wnt Signaling Pathway']",,['NOTNLM'],"['DNA methylation', 'Epigenetics', 'Histone modification', 'Leukemia', 'T lymphocytes', 'Transcription regulation', 'WNT signaling']",2020/05/28 06:00,2021/01/20 06:00,['2020/05/28 06:00'],"['2019/10/08 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/05/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/20 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s00005-020-00583-5 [doi]', '10.1007/s00005-020-00583-5 [pii]']",epublish,Arch Immunol Ther Exp (Warsz). 2020 May 26;68(3):18. doi: 10.1007/s00005-020-00583-5.,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6209-5031'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We hypothesized that a metabolism-restricted genetic screen, comparing normal primary mouse hematopoietic cells and their malignant counterparts in an ex vivo system mimicking the bone marrow microenvironment, would define distinctive vulnerabilities in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Leukemic cells, but not their normal myeloid counterparts, depended on the aldehyde dehydrogenase 3a2 (Aldh3a2) enzyme that oxidizes long-chain aliphatic aldehydes to prevent cellular oxidative damage. Aldehydes are by-products of increased oxidative phosphorylation and nucleotide synthesis in cancer and are generated from lipid peroxides underlying the non-caspase-dependent form of cell death, ferroptosis. Leukemic cell dependence on Aldh3a2 was seen across multiple mouse and human myeloid leukemias. Aldh3a2 inhibition was synthetically lethal with glutathione peroxidase-4 (GPX4) inhibition; GPX4 inhibition is a known trigger of ferroptosis that by itself minimally affects AML cells.

Traditional treatments include chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and surgery. Patients with relapsed, refractory or advanced stage lymphoma have a dismal prognosis. In recent years, chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) have been recognized as powerful tools that redirect antigen-specific T cells independent of human lymphocyte antigen (HLA) restriction and specifically kill tumor cells. Satisfactory results with CAR-based treatments have been achieved in relapsed/refractory B cell leukemia/lymphoma. Our center explored the strategy of subcutaneous injections combined with intravenous drip to overcome certain issues. Case presentation: A patient with stage IV refractory and relapsed diffuse large B cell lymphoma was treated with regional and intravenous CAR-T cells. During the observation period, the temperature of the skin at the abdominal wall mass was slightly elevated, and tolerable pain in the injection area was reported. Imaging showed regional liquefactive necrosis. After the sequential administration of ibrutinib and venetoclax, the abdominal wall mass significantly decreased in size. Conclusion: The regional injection of CAR-T cells might be safe and feasible for the treatment of regional lesions in patients with refractory and relapsed advanced lymphoma.","['Wei, Yan-Hui', 'He, Yu-Zhuo', 'Lin, Xiao-Yan', 'Ren, Fu-Xian', 'Zhu, Hong-Bin', 'Cheng, Ying', 'Nan, Zhen', 'Liu, Zheng-Biao', 'Yu, Jing-Ya', 'Guo, Xue-Jun']","['Wei YH', 'He YZ', 'Lin XY', 'Ren FX', 'Zhu HB', 'Cheng Y', 'Nan Z', 'Liu ZB', 'Yu JY', 'Guo XJ']","['Department of Graduate School, Xinxiang Medical University, Henan, China.', 'Puyang Oilfield General Hospital, Puyang, China.', 'Puyang Oilfield General Hospital, Puyang, China.', 'Puyang Oilfield General Hospital, Puyang, China.', 'Puyang Oilfield General Hospital, Puyang, China.', 'Puyang Oilfield General Hospital, Puyang, China.', 'Puyang Oilfield General Hospital, Puyang, China.', 'Puyang Oilfield General Hospital, Puyang, China.', 'Puyang Oilfield General Hospital, Puyang, China.', 'Puyang Oilfield General Hospital, Puyang, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200508,Switzerland,Front Cell Dev Biol,Frontiers in cell and developmental biology,101630250,,,,PMC7225683,['NOTNLM'],"['case report', 'chimeric antigen receptor T cells', 'diffuse large B cell lymphoma', 'refractory recurrence', 'regional injection']",2020/05/28 06:00,2020/05/28 06:01,['2020/05/28 06:00'],"['2020/01/13 00:00 [received]', '2020/04/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/05/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/28 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fcell.2020.00333 [doi]'],epublish,Front Cell Dev Biol. 2020 May 8;8:333. doi: 10.3389/fcell.2020.00333. eCollection 2020.,,,"['Copyright (c) 2020 Wei, He, Lin, Ren, Zhu, Cheng, Nan, Liu, Yu and Guo.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous studies demonstrated that stenodactylin induces apoptosis and necroptosis in treated cells, involving the production of reactive oxygen species. We analyzed the effect of stenodactylin on Raji and Ramos (Human Burkitt's lymphoma cells) and MOLM-13 (acute myeloid leukemia cells). Moreover, we focused on the early events in MOLM-13 cells that characterize the cellular response to the toxin by whole-genome microarray analysis of gene expression. Treatment with stenodactylin induced the depurination of 28S rRNA within 4 h and increased the phosphorylation of p38 and JNK. A time-dependent activation of caspase 1, 2, 8, 9, 3/7 was also observed. Genome-wide gene expression microarray analysis revealed early changes in the expression of genes involved in the regulation of cell death, inflammation and stress response. After 4 h, a significant increase of transcript level was detectable for ATF3, BTG2, DUSP1, EGR1, and JUN. Increased upstream JUN signaling was also confirmed at protein level. The early response to stenodactylin treatment involves inflammatory and apoptotic signaling compatible with the activation of multiple cell death pathways. Because of the above described properties toward acute myeloid leukemia cells, stenodactylin may be a promising candidate for the design of new immunoconjugates for experimental cancer treatment.","['Mercatelli, Daniele', 'Bortolotti, Massimo', 'Andresen, Vibeke', 'Sulen, Andre', 'Polito, Letizia', 'Gjertsen, Bjorn Tore', 'Bolognesi, Andrea']","['Mercatelli D', 'Bortolotti M', 'Andresen V', 'Sulen A', 'Polito L', 'Gjertsen BT', 'Bolognesi A']","['Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine-DIMES, Alma Mater Studiorum, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.', 'Department of Pharmacy and Biotechnology-FaBiT, Alma Mater Studiorum, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine-DIMES, Alma Mater Studiorum, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.', 'Centre of Cancer Biomarkers CCBIO, Department of Clinical Science, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway.', 'Hematology Section, Department of Internal Medicine, Haukeland University Hospital, Bergen, Norway.', 'Centre of Cancer Biomarkers CCBIO, Department of Clinical Science, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway.', 'Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine-DIMES, Alma Mater Studiorum, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.', 'Centre of Cancer Biomarkers CCBIO, Department of Clinical Science, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway.', 'Hematology Section, Department of Internal Medicine, Haukeland University Hospital, Bergen, Norway.', 'Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine-DIMES, Alma Mater Studiorum, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200508,Switzerland,Front Pharmacol,Frontiers in pharmacology,101548923,,,,PMC7226368,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'apoptosis', 'plant toxins', 'ribosome-inactivating protein', 'stenodactylin', 'toxic lectins', 'type 2 ribosome inactivating protein']",2020/05/28 06:00,2020/05/28 06:01,['2020/05/28 06:00'],"['2020/03/06 00:00 [received]', '2020/04/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/05/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/28 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fphar.2020.00630 [doi]'],epublish,Front Pharmacol. 2020 May 8;11:630. doi: 10.3389/fphar.2020.00630. eCollection 2020.,,,"['Copyright (c) 2020 Mercatelli, Bortolotti, Andresen, Sulen, Polito, Gjertsen and', 'Bolognesi.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the factors modulating this process and the systemic pathophysiological effects of necroptosis are yet to be understood. Here, we identified that Beclin 1 functions as an anti-necroptosis factor by being recruited into the necrosome complex upon treatment with TNFalpha, Smac mimetic, and pan-caspase inhibitor and by repressing MLKL oligomerisation, thus preventing the disruption of the plasma membrane. Cells ablated or knocked-out for Beclin 1 become sensitised to necroptosis in an autophagy-independent manner without affecting the necrosome formation itself. Interestingly, the recruitment of Beclin 1 into the necrosome complex is dependent on the activation and phosphorylation of MLKL. Biochemically, the coiled-coil domain (CCD) of Beclin 1 binds to the CCD of MLKL, which restrains the oligomerisation of phosphorylated MLKL. Finally, Beclin 1 depletion was found to promote necroptosis in leukaemia cells and enhance regression of xenografted-tumour upon treatment with Smac mimetics and caspase inhibitors. These results suggest that Beclin 1 functions as a negative regulator in the execution of necroptosis by suppressing MLKL oligomerisation.","['Seo, Jinho', 'Seong, Daehyeon', 'Nam, Young Woo', 'Hwang, Chi Hyun', 'Lee, Seung Ri', 'Lee, Choong-Sil', 'Jin, Young', 'Lee, Han-Woong', 'Oh, Doo-Byoung', 'Vandenabeele, Peter', 'Song, Jaewhan']","['Seo J', 'Seong D', 'Nam YW', 'Hwang CH', 'Lee SR', 'Lee CS', 'Jin Y', 'Lee HW', 'Oh DB', 'Vandenabeele P', 'Song J']","['Department of Biochemistry, College of Life science and Biotechnology, Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea.', 'Environmental Disease Research Center, Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology (KRIBB), Daejeon, Korea.', 'Department of Biochemistry, College of Life science and Biotechnology, Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Biochemistry, College of Life science and Biotechnology, Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Biochemistry, College of Life science and Biotechnology, Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Biochemistry, College of Life science and Biotechnology, Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Biochemistry, College of Life science and Biotechnology, Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Biochemistry, College of Life science and Biotechnology, Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Biochemistry, College of Life science and Biotechnology, Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea.', 'Environmental Disease Research Center, Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology (KRIBB), Daejeon, Korea.', 'Department of Biosystems and Bioengineering, KRIBB School of Biotechnology, University of Science and Technology (UST), Daejeon, Korea.', 'VIB-UGent Center for Inflammation Research, VIB, B-9052, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Department of Biomedical Molecular Biology, Ghent University, B-9052, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Department of Biochemistry, College of Life science and Biotechnology, Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea. jso678@yonsei.ac.kr.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200526,England,Cell Death Differ,Cell death and differentiation,9437445,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Beclin-1)', '0 (Becn1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Diablo protein, mouse)', '0 (Mitochondrial Proteins)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (TNF protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', 'EC 2.7.- (MLKL protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/metabolism', 'Beclin-1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Caspase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Female', 'HEK293 Cells', 'HT29 Cells', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, Nude', 'Mitochondrial Proteins/metabolism', 'Necroptosis/*drug effects', 'Necrosis', 'Oligopeptides/*pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Kinases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/metabolism', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",PMC7560833,,,2020/05/28 06:00,2021/11/20 06:00,['2020/05/28 06:00'],"['2019/09/02 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/01 00:00 [revised]', '2020/05/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/20 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/28 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41418-020-0561-9 [doi]', '10.1038/s41418-020-0561-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Cell Death Differ. 2020 Nov;27(11):3065-3081. doi: 10.1038/s41418-020-0561-9.

These patients have an extremely poor survival rate and studies show these tumors preferentially undergo senescence instead of apoptosis. These senescent cells persist after chemotherapy and secrete cytokines and chemokines comprising the senescence associated secretory phenotype, which promotes survival, proliferation, and metastasis. We hypothesized that eliminating senescent tumor cells would improve chemotherapy response and extend survival. Previous studies have shown ""senolytic"" agents selectively kill senescent normal cells, but their efficacy in killing chemotherapy-induced senescent cancer cells is unknown. We show that ABT-263, a BH3 mimetic that targets antiapoptotic proteins BCL2/BCL-XL/BCL-W, had no effect on proliferating cells, but rapidly and selectively induced apoptosis in a subset of chemotherapy-treated cancer cells, though sensitivity required days to develop. Low NOXA expression conferred resistance to ABT-263 in some cells, necessitating additional MCL1 inhibition. Gene editing confirmed breast cancer cells relied on BCL-XL or BCL-XL/MCL1 for survival in senescence. In a mouse model of breast cancer, ABT-263 treatment following chemotherapy led to apoptosis, greater tumor regression, and longer survival. Our results reveal cancer cells that have survived chemotherapy by entering senescence can be eliminated using BH3 mimetic drugs that target BCL-XL or BCL-XL/MCL1. These drugs could help minimize residual disease and extend survival in breast cancer patients that otherwise have a poor prognosis and are most in need of improved therapies.","['Shahbandi, Ashkan', 'Rao, Sonia G', 'Anderson, Ashlyn Y', 'Frey, Wesley D', 'Olayiwola, Joy O', 'Ungerleider, Nathan A', 'Jackson, James G']","['Shahbandi A', 'Rao SG', 'Anderson AY', 'Frey WD', 'Olayiwola JO', 'Ungerleider NA', 'Jackson JG']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Tulane Medical School, New Orleans, LA, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Tulane Medical School, New Orleans, LA, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Tulane Medical School, New Orleans, LA, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Tulane Medical School, New Orleans, LA, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Tulane Medical School, New Orleans, LA, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Tulane Medical School, New Orleans, LA, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Tulane Medical School, New Orleans, LA, USA. jjacks8@tulane.edu.']",['eng'],"['P30 GM114732/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'TL1 TR003106/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20200526,England,Cell Death Differ,Cell death and differentiation,9437445,"['0 (Aniline Compounds)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Mitochondrial Membrane Transport Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (PMAIP1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RTL10 protein, human)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', 'XKJ5VVK2WD (navitoclax)']",IM,"['Aniline Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Breast Neoplasms', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cellular Senescence/drug effects', 'Female', 'Gene Editing', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mitochondrial Membrane Transport Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'Sulfonamides/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/*metabolism', 'bcl-X Protein/antagonists & inhibitors']",PMC7560696,,,2020/05/28 06:00,2021/11/20 06:00,['2020/05/28 06:00'],"['2020/01/08 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/20 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/28 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41418-020-0564-6 [doi]', '10.1038/s41418-020-0564-6 [pii]']",ppublish,Cell Death Differ. 2020 Nov;27(11):3097-3116. doi: 10.1038/s41418-020-0564-6.

Phase 1/2 studies GEN501/SIRIUS revealed a novel immunomodulatory mechanism of action (MOA) of daratumumab that enhanced the immune response, reducing natural killer (NK) cells without affecting efficacy or safety. We further evaluated daratumumab's effects on immune cells in whole blood samples of relapsed/refractory MM patients from both treatment arms of the phase 3 POLLUX study (lenalidomide/dexamethasone [Rd] or daratumumab plus Rd [D-Rd]) at baseline (D-Rd, 40; Rd, 45) and after 2 months on treatment (D-Rd, 31; Rd, 33) using cytometry by time-of-flight. We confirmed previous reports of NK cell reduction with D-Rd. Persisting NK cells were phenotypically distinct, with increased expression of HLA-DR, CD69, CD127, and CD27. The proportion of T cells increased preferentially in deep responders to D-Rd, with a higher proportion of CD8(+) versus CD4(+) T cells. The expansion of CD8(+) T cells correlated with clonality, indicating generation of adaptive immune response with D-Rd. D-Rd resulted in a higher proportion of effector memory T cells versus Rd. D-Rd reduced immunosuppressive CD38(+) regulatory T cells. This study confirms daratumumab's immunomodulatory MOA in combination with immunomodulatory drugs and provides further insight into immune cell changes and activation status following daratumumab-based therapy.","['Casneuf, Tineke', 'Adams, Homer C 3rd', 'van de Donk, Niels W C J', 'Abraham, Yann', 'Bald, Jaime', 'Vanhoof, Greet', 'Van der Borght, Koen', 'Smets, Tina', 'Foulk, Brad', 'Nielsen, Karl C', 'Rusbuldt, Joshua', 'Axel, Amy', 'Lysaght, Andrew', 'Ceulemans, Hugo', 'Stevenaert, Frederik', 'Usmani, Saad Z', 'Plesner, Torben', 'Avet-Loiseau, Herve', 'Nijhof, Inger', 'Mutis, Tuna', 'Schecter, Jordan M', 'Chiu, Christopher', 'Bahlis, Nizar J']","['Casneuf T', 'Adams HC 3rd', 'van de Donk NWCJ', 'Abraham Y', 'Bald J', 'Vanhoof G', 'Van der Borght K', 'Smets T', 'Foulk B', 'Nielsen KC', 'Rusbuldt J', 'Axel A', 'Lysaght A', 'Ceulemans H', 'Stevenaert F', 'Usmani SZ', 'Plesner T', 'Avet-Loiseau H', 'Nijhof I', 'Mutis T', 'Schecter JM', 'Chiu C', 'Bahlis NJ']","['Janssen Research & Development, Beerse, Belgium. tcasneu1@its.jnj.com.', 'Janssen Research & Development, LLC, Spring House, PA, USA.', 'Department of Hematology, Amsterdam University Medical Center, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Janssen Research & Development, Beerse, Belgium.', 'Janssen Research & Development, LLC, Spring House, PA, USA.', 'Janssen Research & Development, Beerse, Belgium.', 'Janssen Research & Development, Beerse, Belgium.', 'Janssen Research & Development, Beerse, Belgium.', 'Janssen Research & Development, LLC, Spring House, PA, USA.', 'Janssen Research & Development, LLC, Spring House, PA, USA.', 'Janssen Research & Development, LLC, Spring House, PA, USA.', 'Janssen Research & Development, LLC, Spring House, PA, USA.', 'Immuneering Corp, Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'Janssen Research & Development, Beerse, Belgium.', 'Janssen Research & Development, Beerse, Belgium.', 'Levine Cancer Institute/Carolinas Healthcare System, Charlotte, NC, USA.', 'Vejle Hospital and University of Southern Denmark, Vejle, Denmark.', 'Unite de Genomique du Myelome, CHU Rangueil, Toulouse, France.', 'Department of Hematology, Amsterdam University Medical Center, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Amsterdam University Medical Center, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Janssen Research & Development, LLC, Raritan, NJ, USA.', 'Janssen Research & Development, LLC, Spring House, PA, USA.', 'Arnie Charbonneau Cancer Research Institute, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200526,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '4Z63YK6E0E (daratumumab)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'F0P408N6V4 (Lenalidomide)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers/*analysis', 'Dexamethasone/administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/drug effects/*immunology', 'Lenalidomide/administration & dosage', 'Multiple Myeloma/drug therapy/*immunology/pathology', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/drug effects/*immunology']",PMC7862054,,,2020/05/28 06:00,2021/02/26 06:00,['2020/05/28 06:00'],"['2019/11/19 00:00 [received]', '2020/04/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/04/23 00:00 [revised]', '2020/05/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/26 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/28 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-020-0855-4 [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-020-0855-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2021 Feb;35(2):573-584. doi: 10.1038/s41375-020-0855-4.

To investigate the prevalence and dynamics of genetic alterations among healthy elderly individuals, a cohort of 50 people >80 years was genotyped for commonly mutated leukemia-associated genes by targeted deep next-generation sequencing. A total of 16 somatic mutations were identified in 13/50 (26%) individuals. Mutations occurred at low variant allele frequencies (median 11.7%) and remained virtually stable over 3 years without development of hematologic malignancies in affected individuals. With DNMT3A mutations most frequently detected, another cohort of 160 healthy people spanning all age groups was sequenced specifically for DNMT3A revealing an overall mutation rate of 6.2% (13/210) and an age-dependent increase of mutation prevalence. A significant difference (p = 0.017) in the DNMT3A expression pattern was detected between younger and healthy elderly people as determined by qRT-PCR. To evaluate the selection of clonal hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), bone marrow of two healthy individuals with mutant DNMT3A was transplanted in a humanized mouse model. Xenografts displayed stable kinetics of DNMT3A mutations over 8 months. These findings indicate that the appearance of low-level clones with leukemia-associated mutations is a common age-associated phenomenon, but insufficient to initiate clonal selection and expansion without the additional influence of other factors.","['Midic, Danica', 'Rinke, Jenny', 'Perner, Florian', 'Muller, Violetta', 'Hinze, Anna', 'Pester, Frank', 'Landschulze, Jurgen', 'Ernst, Jana', 'Gruhn, Bernd', 'Matziolis, Georg', 'Heidel, Florian H', 'Hochhaus, Andreas', 'Ernst, Thomas']","['Midic D', 'Rinke J', 'Perner F', 'Muller V', 'Hinze A', 'Pester F', 'Landschulze J', 'Ernst J', 'Gruhn B', 'Matziolis G', 'Heidel FH', 'Hochhaus A', 'Ernst T']","['Abteilung Hamatologie und Internistische Onkologie, Klinik fur Innere Medizin II, Universitatsklinikum Jena, Jena, Germany.', 'Abteilung Hamatologie und Internistische Onkologie, Klinik fur Innere Medizin II, Universitatsklinikum Jena, Jena, Germany.', 'Abteilung Hamatologie und Internistische Onkologie, Klinik fur Innere Medizin II, Universitatsklinikum Jena, Jena, Germany.', 'Abteilung Hamatologie und Internistische Onkologie, Klinik fur Innere Medizin II, Universitatsklinikum Jena, Jena, Germany.', 'Abteilung Hamatologie und Internistische Onkologie, Klinik fur Innere Medizin II, Universitatsklinikum Jena, Jena, Germany.', 'HausArztZentrum, Kahla, Germany.', 'HausArztZentrum, Kahla, Germany.', 'Klinik fur Kinder- und Jugendmedizin, Universitatsklinikum Jena, Jena, Germany.', 'Klinik fur Kinder- und Jugendmedizin, Universitatsklinikum Jena, Jena, Germany.', 'Orthopadische Klinik der Waldkliniken Eisenberg, Eisenberg, Germany.', 'Abteilung Hamatologie und Internistische Onkologie, Klinik fur Innere Medizin II, Universitatsklinikum Jena, Jena, Germany.', 'Leibniz Institute on Aging, Fritz-Lipmann-Institute, Jena, Germany.', 'Abteilung Hamatologie und Internistische Onkologie, Klinik fur Innere Medizin II, Universitatsklinikum Jena, Jena, Germany.', 'Abteilung Hamatologie und Internistische Onkologie, Klinik fur Innere Medizin II, Universitatsklinikum Jena, Jena, Germany. thomas.ernst@med.uni-jena.de.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200526,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNMT3A protein, human)', '0 (Dnmt3a protein, mouse)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA Methyltransferase 3A)']",IM,"['Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Animals', 'Clone Cells', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases/*genetics', 'DNA Methyltransferase 3A', 'Female', 'Hematopoiesis/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Male', 'Mice', '*Mutation', 'Prevalence', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis']",PMC7387320,,,2020/05/28 06:00,2020/11/04 06:00,['2020/05/28 06:00'],"['2020/04/15 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/04/29 00:00 [revised]', '2020/05/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/04 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/28 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-020-0869-y [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-020-0869-y [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2020 Aug;34(8):2198-2205. doi: 10.1038/s41375-020-0869-y.

An abnormal T-cell compartment in the blood of CLL patients was already reported 40 years ago. Since then, our knowledge of T-cell characteristics in CLL has grown steadily, but the question of whether T-cells act as pro-tumoral bystander cells or possess anti-tumoral activity is still under debate. Increased numbers of CD4(+) T-helper cell subsets are present in the blood of CLL patients, and T-helper cell cytokines have been shown to stimulate CLL cell survival and proliferation in vitro. In line with this, survival and growth of CLL cells in murine xenograft models have been shown to rely on activated CD4(+) T-cells. This led to the hypothesis that T-cells are tumor-supportive in CLL. In recent years, evidence for an enrichment of antigen-experienced CD8(+) T-cells in CLL has accumulated, and these cells have been shown to control leukemia in a CLL mouse model. Based on this, it was suggested that CD8(+) T-cells recognize CLL-specific antigens and exert an anti-leukemia function. As described for other cancer entities, T-cells in CLL express multiple inhibitory receptors, such as PD-1, and lose their functional capacity, leading to an exhaustion phenotype which has been shown to be more severe in T-cells from secondary lymphoid organs compared with peripheral blood. This exhausted phenotype has been suggested to be causative for the poor response of CLL patients to CAR T-cell therapies. In addition, T-cells have been shown to be affected by drugs that are used to treat CLL, which likely impacts therapy response. This review provides an overview of the current knowledge about alterations of T-cells in CLL, including their distribution, function, and exhaustion state in blood and lymphoid organs, and touches also on the topic of how CLL drugs impact on the T-cell compartment and recent results of T-cell-based immunotherapy. We will discuss potential pathological roles of T-cell subsets in CLL and address the question of whether they foster progression or control of disease.","['Roessner, Philipp M', 'Seiffert, Martina']","['Roessner PM', 'Seiffert M']","['Molecular Genetics, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Molecular Genetics, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany. m.seiffert@dkfz.de.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200526,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Animals', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/etiology/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/*physiology']",PMC8318881,,,2020/05/28 06:00,2020/11/04 06:00,['2020/05/28 06:00'],"['2019/12/20 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/12 00:00 [revised]', '2020/05/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/04 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/28 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-020-0873-2 [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-020-0873-2 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2020 Aug;34(8):2012-2024. doi: 10.1038/s41375-020-0873-2.

In relapse samples harboring a TKI-resistant ABL1 mutation, the corresponding mutation could not be detected pretreatment, despite validated sequencing sensitivity of Duplex Sequencing down to 0.005%. In samples under the selective pressure of ongoing TKI therapy, we detected low-level, emerging resistance mutations up to 5 months prior to relapse. These findings suggest that pretreatment ABL1 mutation assessment should not guide upfront TKI selection in Ph + ALL, although serial testing while on TKI therapy may allow for early detection of clinically actionable resistant clones.","['Short, Nicholas J', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Kanagal-Shamanna, Rashmi', 'Sasaki, Koji', 'Ravandi, Farhad', 'Cortes, Jorge', 'Konopleva, Marina', 'Issa, Ghayas C', 'Kornblau, Steven M', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Garris, Rebecca', 'Higgins, Jake', 'Pratt, Gabriel', 'Williams, Lindsey N', 'Valentine, Charles C 3rd', 'Rivera, Victor M', 'Pritchard, Justin', 'Salk, Jesse J', 'Radich, Jerald', 'Jabbour, Elias']","['Short NJ', 'Kantarjian H', 'Kanagal-Shamanna R', 'Sasaki K', 'Ravandi F', 'Cortes J', 'Konopleva M', 'Issa GC', 'Kornblau SM', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Garris R', 'Higgins J', 'Pratt G', 'Williams LN', 'Valentine CC 3rd', 'Rivera VM', 'Pritchard J', 'Salk JJ', 'Radich J', 'Jabbour E']","['The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'TwinStrand Biosciences Inc., Seattle, WA, USA.', 'TwinStrand Biosciences Inc., Seattle, WA, USA.', 'TwinStrand Biosciences Inc., Seattle, WA, USA.', 'TwinStrand Biosciences Inc., Seattle, WA, USA.', 'ARIAD Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA.', 'TwinStrand Biosciences Inc., Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA. ejabbour@mdanderson.org.']",['eng'],"['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R44 CA233381/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200526,United States,Blood Cancer J,Blood cancer journal,101568469,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ABL1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation/drug effects', '*Philadelphia Chromosome/drug effects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl/chemistry/*genetics', 'Young Adult']",PMC7250857,,,2020/05/28 06:00,2021/05/05 06:00,['2020/05/28 06:00'],"['2020/03/25 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/04/29 00:00 [revised]', '2020/05/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/05/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/05 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41408-020-0329-y [doi]', '10.1038/s41408-020-0329-y [pii]']",epublish,Blood Cancer J. 2020 May 26;10(5):61. doi: 10.1038/s41408-020-0329-y.,"['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7829-5249', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4339-8683', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5990-9548']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) is used to confirm NGT insertion, especially in adults or prehospital patients, but reports of its use in the pediatric emergency department (ED) are still scarce. We report a case of successful POCUS-guided NGT placement in a pediatric ED. CASE REPORT: A 3-year-old male undergoing remission therapy for acute lymphocytic leukemia presented to our ED with fever and decreased appetite. Tumor lysis syndrome was diagnosed, and endotracheal intubation was required because of the need for emergency hemodialysis for hypercalcemia. Because of difficulty in guiding the tube through the nose, ultrasound-guided placement was attempted. In the transverse view over the neck below the level of the cricoid cartilage, the 10-Fr NGT was visualized under ultrasound guidance as it passed through the esophagus. Subsequently, the entry of the NGT tip into the gastric cardia was confirmed on the subxiphoid longitudinal view. A chest radiograph confirmed the presence of the NGT in the stomach. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: Although the utility of POCUS for NGT placement was reported in adult patients, reports of its use in pediatric cases are still few. POCUS is a real-time, noninvasive, time-saving procedure that can be a useful alternative to radiography for confirming correct NGT placement.","['Mori, Takaaki', 'Takei, Hirokazu', 'Nomura, Osamu', 'Ihara, Takateru', 'Hagiwara, Yusuke']","['Mori T', 'Takei H', 'Nomura O', 'Ihara T', 'Hagiwara Y']","[""Division of Pediatric Emergency Medicine, Department of Pediatric Emergency and Critical Care Medicine, Tokyo Metropolitan Children's Medical Center, Tokyo, Japan."", ""Division of Pediatric Emergency Medicine, Department of Pediatric Emergency and Critical Care Medicine, Tokyo Metropolitan Children's Medical Center, Tokyo, Japan."", 'Department of Emergency and Disaster Medicine, Hirosaki University, Hirosaki City, Japan.', ""Division of Pediatric Emergency Medicine, Department of Pediatric Emergency and Critical Care Medicine, Tokyo Metropolitan Children's Medical Center, Tokyo, Japan."", ""Division of Pediatric Emergency Medicine, Department of Pediatric Emergency and Critical Care Medicine, Tokyo Metropolitan Children's Medical Center, Tokyo, Japan.""]",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20200523,United States,J Emerg Med,The Journal of emergency medicine,8412174,,IM,"['Child, Preschool', 'Humans', '*Intubation, Gastrointestinal', 'Male', '*Point-of-Care Systems', 'Point-of-Care Testing', 'Ultrasonography', 'Ultrasonography, Interventional']",,['NOTNLM'],"['children', 'nasogastric tube placement', 'ultrasound-guided procedure']",2020/05/28 06:00,2021/06/24 06:00,['2020/05/28 06:00'],"['2020/02/10 00:00 [received]', '2020/04/05 00:00 [revised]', '2020/04/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/24 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/28 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0736-4679(20)30361-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jemermed.2020.04.029 [doi]']",ppublish,J Emerg Med. 2020 Aug;59(2):e57-e60. doi: 10.1016/j.jemermed.2020.04.029.

The aim of this study was to clarify the role of Tregs in the immune escape of acute myeloid leukemia. METHODS: The frequencies of Tregs and the expression of PD-1, CXCR4 and CXCR7 were examined by flow cytometry. The expression of CTLA-4 and GITR was tested by MFI. Chemotaxis assays were performed to evaluate Treg migration. The concentrations of SDF-1alpha, IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha were examined by ELISA. Coculture and crisscross coculture experiments were performed to examine Treg proliferation and apoptosis and the effect of regulatory B cells (Breg) conversion. RESULTS: The frequencies of Tregs in peripheral blood and bone marrow in AML patients were increased compared with those in healthy participants. AML Tregs had robust migration towards bone marrow due to increased expression of CXCR4. AML Treg-mediated immunosuppression of T cells was achieved through proliferation inhibition, apoptosis promotion and suppression of IFN-gamma production in CD4(+)CD25(-) T cells. AML Bregs induced the conversion of CD4(+)CD25(-)T cells to Tregs. CONCLUSION: In AML patients, the Breg conversion effect and robust CXCR4-induced migration led to Treg enrichment in bone marrow. AML Tregs downregulated the function of CD4(+)CD25(-) T cells, contributing to immune escape.","['Wan, Yuling', 'Zhang, Congxiao', 'Xu, Yingxi', 'Wang, Min', 'Rao, Qing', 'Xing, Haiyan', 'Tian,

S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) is the universal methyl donor in human cells and is synthesized by methionine adenosyltransferase 2A (MAT2A), which is deregulated in different cancer types. Here, we used our human CRISPR/Cas9-MLL-rearranged (CRISPR/Cas9-MLLr) leukemia model, faithfully mimicking MLLr patients' pathology with indefinite growth potential in vitro, to evaluate the unknown role of MAT2A. Comparable to publicly available patient data, we detected MAT2A to be significantly overexpressed in our CRISPR/Cas9-MLLr model compared to healthy controls. By using non-MLLr and MLLr cell lines and our model, we detected an MLLr-specific enhanced response to PF-9366, a new MAT2A inhibitor, and small interfering (si) RNA-mediated knockdown of MAT2A, by alteration of the proliferation, viability, differentiation, apoptosis, cell cycling, and histone methylation. Moreover, the combinational treatment of PF-9366 with chemotherapy or targeted therapies against the SAM-dependent methyltransferases, disruptor of telomeric silencing 1 like (DOT1L) and protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5), revealed even more pronounced effects. In summary, we uncovered MAT2A as a key regulator in MLL leukemogenesis and its inhibition led to significant anti-leukemic effects. Therefore, our study paves the avenue for clinical application of PF-9366 to improve the treatment of poor prognosis MLLr leukemia.","['Secker, Kathy-Ann', 'Bloechl, Bianca', 'Keppeler, Hildegard', 'Duerr-Stoerzer, Silke', 'Schmid, Hannes', 'Schneidawind, Dominik', 'Jeong, Johan', 'Hentrich, Thomas', 'Schulze-Hentrich, Julia M', 'Schneidawind, Corina']","['Secker KA', 'Bloechl B', 'Keppeler H', 'Duerr-Stoerzer S', 'Schmid H', 'Schneidawind D', 'Jeong J', 'Hentrich T', 'Schulze-Hentrich JM', 'Schneidawind C']","['Department of Hematology, Oncology, Clinical Immunology and Rheumatology, University Hospital Tuebingen, 72076 Tuebingen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology, Clinical Immunology and Rheumatology, University Hospital Tuebingen, 72076 Tuebingen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology, Clinical Immunology and Rheumatology, University Hospital Tuebingen, 72076 Tuebingen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology, Clinical Immunology and Rheumatology, University Hospital Tuebingen, 72076 Tuebingen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology, Clinical Immunology and Rheumatology, University Hospital Tuebingen, 72076 Tuebingen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology, Clinical Immunology and Rheumatology, University Hospital Tuebingen, 72076 Tuebingen, Germany.', 'Synthego Corporation, Menlo Park, CA 94025, USA.', 'Institute of Medical Genetics and Applied Genomics, University of Tuebingen, 72076 Tuebingen, Germany.', 'Institute of Medical Genetics and Applied Genomics, University of Tuebingen, 72076 Tuebingen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology, Clinical Immunology and Rheumatology, University Hospital Tuebingen, 72076 Tuebingen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['70112548/Deutsche Krebshilfe', '01KU1503/Bundesministerium fur Bildung, Wissenschaft und Forschung', 'IZKF, 2383-0-0/Junior Research Group Grant of the Interdisciplinary Centre for', 'Clinical Research', '.../Wuerttembergischer Krebspreis', '390-0-0/Clinician Scientist Program of the Faculty of Medicine Tuebingen', '.../Margarete-von-Wrangell fellowship through the Ministry of Science, Research', 'and the Arts Baden-Wuerttemberg', 'IZKF, 2386-0-0/Junior Research Group Grant of the Interdisciplinary Centre for', 'Clinical Research']",['Journal Article'],20200524,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,,,PMC7281730,['NOTNLM'],"['CRISPR/Cas9', 'MAT2A', 'MLL-rearranged leukemia', 'pharmacological study']",2020/05/28 06:00,2020/05/28 06:01,['2020/05/28 06:00'],"['2020/03/24 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/15 00:00 [revised]', '2020/05/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/05/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/28 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers12051342 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers12051342 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2020 May 24;12(5). pii: cancers12051342. doi: 10.3390/cancers12051342.,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-8230-4670', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1488-9096', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9242-2096', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7333-8980']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study aimed to examine changes in leukemia patients' comfort level during chemotherapy in isolation wards. Methods: A longitudinal survey was conducted with measures which were repeated four times. Data were collected before chemotherapy, on the first and second week after receiving chemotherapy in positive pressure isolation rooms, and on the third week in the non-isolated hematology ward. Each patient received six questionnaires measuring demographic data, comfort status, functional status, fatigue related to cancer therapy, anxiety level, and distress symptoms. A mixed model with repeated measure analysis was used to examine the changing trajectories in physical and psychological health. Results: Twenty-one patients completed the study. During the process, the highest score for comfort level was shown before chemotherapy, and this decreased from the second week under isolation. Anxiety and uncertainty (p < 0.05) declined over time, and emotional states improved during the recovery period in the third and fourth weeks outside isolation. Physical well-being (p < 0.01), cancer-related fatigue (p < 0.05), hemoglobin (p < 0.01) and white blood cell count (p < 0.05) began to rise two weeks after chemotherapy. Conclusion: Comfort levels declined after chemotherapy until the third week of treatment. Anxiety, fatigue and distress symptoms varied across the four time points of chemotherapy from isolation to return to the non-isolated ward. Health care professionals should be aware of psychological symptoms when patients are in isolation rooms, and interventions for promoting a humanized environment, quality of life, and comfort should be considered and provided along with the treatment stages of chemotherapy.","['You, Wun-Yu', 'Yeh, Tzu-Pei', 'Lee, Kwo-Chen', 'Ma, Wei-Fen']","['You WY', 'Yeh TP', 'Lee KC', 'Ma WF']","['Department of Nursing, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung 40402, Taiwan.', 'Department of Nursing, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung 40402, Taiwan.', 'School of Nursing, China Medical University, Taichung 40402, Taiwan.', 'Department of Nursing, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung 40402, Taiwan.', 'School of Nursing, China Medical University, Taichung 40402, Taiwan.', 'Department of Nursing, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung 40402, Taiwan.', 'School of Nursing, China Medical University, Taichung 40402, Taiwan.', 'Brain Disease Research Center, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung 40402, Taiwan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200522,Switzerland,Int J Environ Res Public Health,International journal of environmental research and public health,101238455,,IM,"['Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Fatigue', 'Humans', '*Leukemia/therapy', '*Patient Isolation', '*Positive-Pressure Respiration', '*Quality of Life']",PMC7277353,['NOTNLM'],"['*anxiety', '*comfort', '*distress symptom', '*fatigue', '*isolation', '*leukemia', '*oncology', '*positive pressure isolation room']",2020/05/28 06:00,2020/10/06 06:00,['2020/05/28 06:00'],"['2020/04/09 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/18 00:00 [revised]', '2020/05/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/05/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/06 06:00 [medline]']","['ijerph17103655 [pii]', '10.3390/ijerph17103655 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Environ Res Public Health. 2020 May 22;17(10). pii: ijerph17103655. doi: 10.3390/ijerph17103655.,['ORCID: 0000-0001-8203-5909'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The inhibitory effects on cell degranulation, proinflammatory cytokine secretion, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production were studied in compound 48/80-treated RBL-2H3 cells. The bioactive compounds in AF-343 were also identified by HPLC-UV. AF-343 was found to effectively suppress compound 48/80-induced b-hexosaminidase release, and interleukin (IL)-4 and tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) production in RBL-2H3 cells. In addition, AF-343 exhibited DPPH free radical scavenging effects in vitro (half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) = 105 mug/mL) and potently inhibited compound 48/80-induced cellular ROS generation in a 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) assay. Specifically, treatment with AF-343 exerted stronger antioxidant effects in vitro and antiallergic effects in cells than treatment with three single natural plant extracts. Furthermore, AF-343 was observed to contain bioactive compounds, including catechin, aurantio-obtusin, and chicoric acid, which have been reported to elicit antiallergic responses. This study reveals that AF-343 attenuates allergic responses via suppression of b-hexosaminidase release, IL-4 and TNF-a secretion, and ROS generation, perhaps through mechanisms related to catechin, aurantio-obtusin, and chicoric acid. The results indicate that AF-343 can be considered a treatment for various allergic diseases.","['Lee, Eun Kyeong', 'Song, Jeongah', 'Seo, Youjin', 'Koh, Eun Mi', 'Kim, Seon-Hee', 'Jung, Kyung Jin']","['Lee EK', 'Song J', 'Seo Y', 'Koh EM', 'Kim SH', 'Jung KJ']","['Bioanalytical and Immunoanalytical Research Group, Korea Institute of Toxicology, 141 Gajungro, Yuseong-gu, Daejeon 34114, Korea.', 'Animal Model Research Group, Korea Institute of Toxicology, Jeongeup, Jeonbuk 580-185, Korea.', 'Jeonbuk Analytical Research Group, Korea Institute of Toxicology, Jeongeup, Jeonbuk 580-185, Korea.', 'Bioanalytical and Immunoanalytical Research Group, Korea Institute of Toxicology, 141 Gajungro, Yuseong-gu, Daejeon 34114, Korea.', 'Sungkyun Biotech Co., Ltd., SungKyunKwan University, #2066, Seobu-ro, Jangan-gu, Suwon-si, Gyeonggi-do 61256, Korea.', 'Bioanalytical and Immunoanalytical Research Group, Korea Institute of Toxicology, 141 Gajungro, Yuseong-gu, Daejeon 34114, Korea.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200522,Switzerland,Molecules,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",100964009,"['0 (Anti-Allergic Agents)', '0 (Drug Combinations)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '4091-50-3 (p-Methoxy-N-methylphenethylamine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anti-Allergic Agents/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Cell Degranulation/drug effects', 'Cinnamomum aromaticum/*chemistry', 'Drug Combinations', 'Humans', 'Hypersensitivity/*drug therapy', 'Mast Cells/drug effects', 'Plant Extracts/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Rats', 'Taraxacum/*chemistry', 'Ulmus/*chemistry', 'p-Methoxy-N-methylphenethylamine']",PMC7288106,['NOTNLM'],"['Cassia tora L., Ulmus pumila L., Taraxacum officinale', 'Keywords: AF-343', 'RBL-2H3 cells', 'antiallergic responses', 'compound 48/80']",2020/05/28 06:00,2021/02/17 06:00,['2020/05/28 06:00'],"['2020/04/10 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/14 00:00 [revised]', '2020/05/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/05/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/17 06:00 [medline]']","['molecules25102434 [pii]', '10.3390/molecules25102434 [doi]']",epublish,Molecules. 2020 May 22;25(10). pii: molecules25102434. doi: 10.3390/molecules25102434.,['ORCID: 0000-0002-1079-2182'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated natural killer (NK) cell reconstitution and cytotoxic/cytokine production in controlling CMV infection, especially severe CMV disease in HSCT patients. Fifty-eight patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who received allo-HSCT were included. We monitored NK reconstitution and NK function at baseline, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, and 180 days after HSCT, and compared the results in recipients stratified on post-HSCT CMV reactivation (n = 23), non-reactivation (n = 24) versus CMV disease (n = 11) groups. The CMV disease group had a significantly delayed recovery of CD56dim NK cells and expansion of FcRgamma-CD3zeta+NK cells started post-HSCT 150 days. Sequential results of NK cytotoxicity, NK cell-mediated antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (NK-ADCC), and NK-Interferon-gamma (NK-IFNgamma) production for 180 days demonstrated delayed recovery and decreased levels in the CMV disease group compared with the other groups. The results within 1 month after CMV viremia also showed a significant decrease in NK function in the CMV disease group compared to the CMV reactivation group. It suggests that NK cells' maturation and cytotoxic/IFNgamma production contributes to CMV protection, thereby revealing the NK phenotype and functional NK monitoring as a biomarker for CMV risk prediction, especially CMV disease.","['Park, Ki Hyun', 'Ryu, Ji Hyeong', 'Bae, Hyunjoo', 'Yun, Sojeong', 'Jang, Joo Hee', 'Han, Kyungja', 'Cho, Byung Sik', 'Kim, Hee-Je', 'Lee, Hyeyoung', 'Oh, Eun-Jee']","['Park KH', 'Ryu JH', 'Bae H', 'Yun S', 'Jang JH', 'Han K', 'Cho BS', 'Kim HJ', 'Lee H', 'Oh EJ']","['Department of Biomedicine & Health Sciences, Graduate School, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul 06591, Korea.', ""Department of Laboratory Medicine, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul 06591, Korea."", 'Department of Biomedicine & Health Sciences, Graduate School, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul 06591, Korea.', 'Department of Biomedicine & Health Sciences, Graduate School, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul 06591, Korea.', 'Department of Biomedicine & Health Sciences, Graduate School, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul 06591, Korea.', ""Department of Laboratory Medicine, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul 06591, Korea."", ""Department of Hematology, Catholic Hematology Hospital, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul 06591, Korea."", ""Department of Hematology, Catholic Hematology Hospital, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul 06591, Korea."", ""Department of Laboratory Medicine, Catholic Kwandong University International St. Mary's Hospital, Incheon 22711, Korea. shomermaid@catholic.ac.kr."", ""Department of Laboratory Medicine, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul 06591, Korea.""]",['eng'],['NRF-2017R1A2B4011181/National Research Foundation of Korea'],['Journal Article'],20200522,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,"['0 (Receptors, Natural Killer Cell)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytomegalovirus/*immunology', 'Cytomegalovirus Infections/complications/*immunology', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Interferon-gamma/metabolism', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*immunology/therapy/*virology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Receptors, Natural Killer Cell/metabolism', 'Risk Factors', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",PMC7279475,['NOTNLM'],"['IFNgamma', 'NK cell-mediated antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity', 'NK cells', 'NK subsets', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'cytomegalovirus', 'hematopoietic stem cell transplantation']",2020/05/28 06:00,2021/02/09 06:00,['2020/05/28 06:00'],"['2020/04/15 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/18 00:00 [revised]', '2020/05/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/05/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/09 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms21103663 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms21103663 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2020 May 22;21(10). pii: ijms21103663. doi: 10.3390/ijms21103663.,"['ORCID: 0000-0003-4098-3366', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5870-915X']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As negative group, 4 fetuses without CMV infection and without HB were studied. Immunohistochemistry for CMV, lymphocytic infiltrate, B-cell leukemia/lymphoma-2 (bcl-2), CD-117, cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR) were performed. HB fetuses showed multiple and sequential CMV-positive ganglion cells of Auerbach's myenteric plexus. In the ganglia, bcl-2 was weakly expressed representing a reduced neuronal functionality. CD-117 revealed a regular distribution of Cajal cells, the pacemakers of intestinal contractility. Pancreas showed normal CFTR staining, indicating a preserved exocrine secretion, thus unlikely a contributory factor in HB. In CMV-infected fetuses without HB, CMV-positive cells were scatteredly found in ganglion cells and bcl-2 was strongly expressed. Intestinal CD-117 and pancreatic CFTR expression were similar to fetuses with HB.

Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HCT) is the most established cellular therapy, but chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapies have gained attention in recent years. While in allo-HCT an entirely novel allogeneic immune system facilitates a so-called Graft-versus-tumor, respectively, Graft-versus-leukemia (GvT/GvL) effect against high-risk hematologic malignancies, in CAR T cell therapies genetically modified autologous T cells specifically attack target molecules on malignant cells. These therapies have achieved high success rates, offering potential cures in otherwise detrimental diseases. However, relapse after cellular therapy remains a serious clinical obstacle. Checkpoint Inhibition (CI), which was recently designated as breakthrough in cancer treatment and consequently awarded with the Nobel prize in 2018, is a different way to increase anti-tumor immunity. Here, inhibitory immune checkpoints are blocked on immune cells in order to restore the immunological force against malignant diseases. Disease relapse after CAR T cell therapy or allo-HCT has been linked to up-regulation of immune checkpoints that render cancer cells resistant to the cell-mediated anti-cancer immune effects. Thus, enhancing immune cell function after cellular therapies using CI is an important treatment option that might re-activate the anti-cancer effect upon cell therapy. In this review, we will summarize current data on this topic with the focus on immune checkpoints after cellular therapy for malignant diseases and balance efficacy versus potential side effects.","['Schmitz, Friederike', 'Wolf, Dominik', 'Holderried, Tobias A W']","['Schmitz F', 'Wolf D', 'Holderried TAW']","['Department of Hematology, Oncology and Rheumatology, University Hospital Bonn, 53127 Bonn, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Rheumatology, University Hospital Bonn, 53127 Bonn, Germany.', 'UKIM 5, Hematology and Oncology, Medical University Innsbruck, 6020 Innsbruck, Austria.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Rheumatology, University Hospital Bonn, 53127 Bonn, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200521,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,['0 (Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors)'],IM,"['Graft vs Leukemia Effect', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/*methods', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*therapy']",PMC7279282,['NOTNLM'],"['CAR T cell therapy', 'GvHD', 'GvL', 'allogeneic stem cell transplantation', 'cellular therapy', 'checkpoint inhibition', 'immune checkpoints']",2020/05/28 06:00,2021/02/17 06:00,['2020/05/28 06:00'],"['2020/04/27 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/18 00:00 [revised]', '2020/05/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/05/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/17 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms21103650 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms21103650 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2020 May 21;21(10). pii: ijms21103650. doi: 10.3390/ijms21103650.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: Standardized incidence ratios (SIR) vs the general population and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for solid-SMN and heme-SMN were calculated for 24 900 TC survivors (TCS) reported to the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results registries (1973-2014). All statistical tests were two-sided. Results: The median age at TC diagnosis was 33 years. Initial management comprised chemotherapy (n = 6340), radiotherapy (n = 9058), or surgery alone (n = 8995). During 372 709 person-years of follow-up (mean = 15 years), 1625 TCS developed solid-SMN and 228 (107 lymphomas, 92 leukemias, 29 plasma cell dyscrasias) developed heme-SMN. Solid-SMN risk was increased 1.06-fold (95% CI = 1.01 to 1.12), with elevated risks following radiotherapy (SIR = 1.13, 95% CI = 1.06 to 1.21) and chemotherapy (SIR = 1.36, 95% CI = 1.12 to 1.41) but not surgery alone (SIR = 0.83, 95% CI = 0.75 to 0.92). Corresponding risks for seminoma were 1.13 (95% CI = 1.06 to 1.21), 1.28 (95% CI = 1.02 to 1.58), and 0.87 (95% CI = 0.74 to 1.01) and for nonseminoma were 1.05 (95% CI = 0.67 to 1.56), 1.25 (95% CI = 1.08 to 1.43), and 0.80 (95% CI = 0.70 to 0.92), respectively. Thirty-year cumulative incidences of solid-SMN after radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and surgery alone were 16.9% (95% CI = 15.7% to 18.1%), 10.1% (95% CI = 8.8% to 11.5%), and 8.8% (95% CI = 7.8% to 9.9%), respectively (P < .0001). Increased leukemia risks after chemotherapy (SIR = 2.68, 95% CI = 1.70 to 4.01) were driven by statistically significant sevenfold excesses of acute myeloid leukemia 1 to 10 years after TC diagnosis. Risks for lymphoma and plasma cell dyscrasias were not elevated. Conclusions: We report statistically significant excesses of solid-SMN affecting 1 in 6 TCS 30 years after radiotherapy, and 2.7-fold risks of leukemias after chemotherapy, mostly acute myeloid leukemia. Efforts to minimize chemotherapy and radiotherapy exposures for TC should continue. TCS should be counseled about cancer prevention and screening.","['Milano, Michael T', 'Dinh, Paul C', 'Yang, Hongmei', 'Zaid, Mohammad Abu', 'Fossa, Sophie D', 'Feldman, Darren R', 'Monahan, Patrick O', 'Travis, Lois B', 'Fung, Chunkit']","['Milano MT', 'Dinh PC', 'Yang H', 'Zaid MA', 'Fossa SD', 'Feldman DR', 'Monahan PO', 'Travis LB', 'Fung C']","['University of Rochester, School of Medicine and Dentistry, Rochester, NY, USA.', 'Indiana University School of Medicine and Fairbanks School of Public Health, Indianapolis, IN, USA.', 'University of Rochester, School of Medicine and Dentistry, Rochester, NY, USA.', 'Indiana University School of Medicine and Fairbanks School of Public Health, Indianapolis, IN, USA.', 'Norwegian Radium Hospital, Oslo, Norway.', 'Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Indiana University School of Medicine and Fairbanks School of Public Health, Indianapolis, IN, USA.', 'Indiana University School of Medicine and Fairbanks School of Public Health, Indianapolis, IN, USA.', 'University of Rochester, School of Medicine and Dentistry, Rochester, NY, USA.']",['eng'],['P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['Journal Article'],20200317,England,JNCI Cancer Spectr,JNCI cancer spectrum,101721827,,,,PMC7236780,,,2020/05/27 06:00,2020/05/27 06:01,['2020/05/27 06:00'],"['2019/05/20 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/17 00:00 [revised]', '2020/02/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/05/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/27 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1093/jncics/pkaa017 [doi]', 'pkaa017 [pii]']",epublish,JNCI Cancer Spectr. 2020 Mar 17;4(3):pkaa017. doi: 10.1093/jncics/pkaa017. eCollection 2020 Jun.,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-8676-2855', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0235-8519', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3729-2217', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2424-4635', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9384-0732']",,['(c) The Author(s) 2020.

Importantly, human DcpS is the recognized target for spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) therapy, and has recently been connected to development of intellectual disability. Most recombinant DcpSs used in biochemical and biophysical studies are prepared as tagged proteins, with polyhistidine (His-tag) at the N-terminus or C-terminus. Our work is the first report on the parallel characterization of three versions of DcpSs (native and N- or C-terminally tagged) of three species (humans, Caenorhabditis elegans , and Ascaris suum). The native forms of all three enzymes were prepared by N-(His)10 tag cleavage. Protein thermal stability, measured by differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF), was unaffected in the case of native and tagged versions of human and A. suum DcpS; however, the melting temperature (T m) of C. elagans DcpS of was significantly influenced by the presence of the additional N- or C-tag. To investigate the impact of the tag positioning on the catalytic properties of DcpS, we tested the hydrolytic activity of native DcpS and their His-tagged counterparts toward cap dinucleotides (m(7)GpppG and m3 (2,2,7)GpppG) and m(7)GDP. The kinetic data indicate that dinucleotide substrates are hydrolyzed with comparable efficiency by native human and A. suum DcpS and their His-tagged forms. In contrast, both His-tagged C. elegans DcpSs exhibited higher activity toward m(7)GpppG than the native enzyme. m(7)GDP is resistant to enzymatic cleavage by all three forms of human and nematode DcpS.","['Ferenc-Mrozek, Aleksandra', 'Bojarska, Elzbieta', 'Stepinski, Janusz', 'Darzynkiewicz, Edward', 'Lukaszewicz, Maciej']","['Ferenc-Mrozek A', 'Bojarska E', 'Stepinski J', 'Darzynkiewicz E', 'Lukaszewicz M']","['Division of Biophysics, Institute of Experimental Physics, Faculty of Physics, University of Warsaw, 02-093 Warsaw, Poland.', 'Centre of New Technologies, University of Warsaw, 02-093 Warsaw, Poland.', 'Centre of New Technologies, University of Warsaw, 02-093 Warsaw, Poland.', 'Division of Biophysics, Institute of Experimental Physics, Faculty of Physics, University of Warsaw, 02-093 Warsaw, Poland.', 'Division of Biophysics, Institute of Experimental Physics, Faculty of Physics, University of Warsaw, 02-093 Warsaw, Poland.', 'Centre of New Technologies, University of Warsaw, 02-093 Warsaw, Poland.', 'Division of Biophysics, Institute of Experimental Physics, Faculty of Physics, University of Warsaw, 02-093 Warsaw, Poland.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200506,United States,ACS Omega,ACS omega,101691658,,,,PMC7240826,,,2020/05/27 06:00,2020/05/27 06:01,['2020/05/27 06:00'],"['2020/01/22 00:00 [received]', '2020/04/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/05/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/27 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1021/acsomega.0c00304 [doi]'],epublish,ACS Omega. 2020 May 6;5(19):10759-10766. doi: 10.1021/acsomega.0c00304. eCollection 2020 May 19.,,['The authors declare no competing financial interest.'],['Copyright (c) 2020 American Chemical Society.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients on imatinib treatment may develop cytopenia due to drug toxicity. This study aimed to determine the types, grades, and time course of cytopenia in CML patients on imatinib at a Nairobi hospital. Methods: This was a cross-sectional descriptive study of adult patients aged >/=18 years followed up at the Glivec International Patient Access Program (GIPAP) clinic from 2007 to 2015. Patients who developed cytopenia within 12 months of initiating imatinib were eligible. Clinical and hematologic data were retrieved from the patients' charts and entered into a study proforma. Measures of central tendency such as mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and variance were used for analysis. Results: Sixty three percent (63.6%) of the 94 patients developed a monocytopenia, with anemia seen in 34%, neutropenia in 27.6%, and thrombocytopenia in 8% of the 94 patients. Anemia plus neutropenia was the most common bicytopenia at 12.7%. Pancytopenia was seen in only 5 of the 94 patients. Most of the cytopenia was grades 2 and 3. Anemia was present at baseline while neutropenia and thrombocytopenia developed within 12 months of imatinib initiation. Anemia resolved during the first 12 months of therapy while neutropenia and thrombocytopenia resolved within 24-36 months of treatment. Conclusion: Monocytopenia, especially anemia, was the most common type of cytopenia. The cytopenia was predominantly grade 2, developed in majority of the patients within 6 months after imatinib initiation, and had resolved by 24-36 months after imatinib initiation.","['McLigeyo, Angela', 'Rajab, Jamilla', 'Ezzi, Mohammed', 'Oyiro, Peter', 'Bett, Yatich', 'Odhiambo, Andrew', ""Ong'ondi, Matilda"", 'Mwanzi, Sitna', 'Gatua, Mercy', 'Abinya, NAOthieno-']","['McLigeyo A', 'Rajab J', 'Ezzi M', 'Oyiro P', 'Bett Y', 'Odhiambo A', ""Ong'ondi M"", 'Mwanzi S', 'Gatua M', 'Abinya N']","['Department of Medicine, Maseno University, Kisumu, Kenya.', 'Department of Clinical Medicine and Therapeutics, University of Nairobi, Nairobi, Kenya.', 'Department of Clinical Medicine and Therapeutics, University of Nairobi, Nairobi, Kenya.', 'Hemato-Oncology Unit, Kenyatta National Hospital, Nairobi, Kenya.', 'Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital, Eldoret, Kenya.', 'Department of Clinical Medicine and Therapeutics, University of Nairobi, Nairobi, Kenya.', 'Hemato-Oncology Unit, Kenyatta National Hospital, Nairobi, Kenya.', 'Aga Khan University Teaching Hospital, Nairobi, Kenya.', 'Department of Clinical Medicine and Therapeutics, University of Nairobi, Nairobi, Kenya.', 'Department of Clinical Medicine and Therapeutics, University of Nairobi, Nairobi, Kenya.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200512,United States,Adv Hematol,Advances in hematology,101504271,,,,PMC7240645,,,2020/05/27 06:00,2020/05/27 06:01,['2020/05/27 06:00'],"['2019/06/22 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/31 00:00 [revised]', '2020/04/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/05/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/27 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1155/2020/7696204 [doi]'],epublish,Adv Hematol. 2020 May 12;2020:7696204. doi: 10.1155/2020/7696204. eCollection 2020.,"['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2439-1793', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9683-4477']","['The authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest regarding the', 'publication of this paper.']",['Copyright (c) 2020 Angela McLigeyo et al.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, some patients with CML develop imatinib resistance. Several new generation drugs have been developed, but do not overcome this problem. Glycyrrhetic acid (GA) is a plant-derived pentacyclic triterpenoid that exhibits multiple pharmacological properties for the treatment of cancers. The current study aimed to investigate the effects of GA on the K562 cell line (Bcr-Abl positive leukemia). Materials and Methods: The MTT cell proliferation assay was employed to evaluate the cytotoxic effect of GA compared with imatinib (positive control) against leukemia and normal blood cells. For detection of cell death, an apoptotic/necrotic/healthy assay was performed against the K562 cell line. To investigate the kinase inhibitory activity of GA, the Abl1 kinase profiling assay and a molecular docking study were performed. Results: GA showed Abl kinase inhibitory activity with an IC50 value of 29.2 muM and induced apoptosis in the K562 cell line after 6 h of treatment. Conclusion: The current findings indicate that this class of plant extract could be a potential candidate for treatment of CML.","['Ciftci, Halilibrahim']",['Ciftci H'],"['Kumamoto University, School of Pharmacy, Department of Bioorganic Medicinal Chemistry, Kumamoto, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200219,Turkey,Turk J Pharm Sci,Turkish journal of pharmaceutical sciences,101717890,,,,PMC7227864,['NOTNLM'],"['Abl kinase', 'K562 cells', 'Pentacyclic triterpenoid', 'apoptosis', 'glycyrrhetic acid']",2020/05/27 06:00,2020/05/27 06:01,['2020/05/27 06:00'],"['2018/08/10 00:00 [received]', '2018/10/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/05/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/27 06:01 [medline]']","['10.4274/tjps.galenos.2018.49389 [doi]', '20220 [pii]']",ppublish,Turk J Pharm Sci. 2020 Feb;17(1):49-55. doi: 10.4274/tjps.galenos.2018.49389.

In this study, a series of acylhydroquinones with different acyl-chain length, and their chlorinated derivatives, in the aromatic ring, synthesized by Fries rearrangement under microwave irradiation, were evaluated for their anticancer activity in two leukemia cell lines. Findings from the primary and secondary screening of the 18 acylhydroquinones, tested at 5 microM on acute promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 and acute lymphoblastic leukemia CEM cells lines, identified an acylchlorohydroquinone (12) with a highly selective anti-proliferative effect toward HL-60 cells. This compound induced S-phase arrest in the cell cycle progression of HL-60 cells with insignificant toxicity on leukemic CEM cells and non-cancerous Hs27 cells. In HL-60 leukemic cells, 12 triggered increased mitochondrial NADH oxidation, increased respiration in presence of oligomycin (state 4o), mitochondrial depolarization, and ROS production, suggesting an uncoupling of OXPHOS. This provoked a metabolic adaptation dependent on AMPK/ACC/autophagy axis, having the mitochondrial beta-oxidation a pro-survival role since the combination of 12 and etomoxir, a carnitine palmitoyl-transferase (CPT) inhibitor promoted extensive HL-60 cell death. Finally, 12-induced metabolic stress sensitized to HL-60 cells to cell death by the FDA-approved anti-leukemic drug ABT-199, a BH3 mimetic. Therefore, our results suggest that acylchlorohydroquinone is a promising scaffold in anti-promyelocytic leukemia drug research.","['Donoso-Bustamante, Viviana', 'Borrego, Edgar A', 'Schiaffino-Bustamante, Yareli', 'Gutierrez, Denisse A', 'Millas-Vargas, Juan Pablo', 'Fuentes-Retamal, Sebastian', 'Correa, Pablo', 'Carrillo, Ileana', 'Aguilera, Renato J', 'Miranda, Dante', 'Chavez-Baez, Ignacio', 'Pulgar, Rodrigo', 'Urra, Felix A', 'Varela-Ramirez, Armando', 'Araya-Maturana, Ramiro']","['Donoso-Bustamante V', 'Borrego EA', 'Schiaffino-Bustamante Y', 'Gutierrez DA', 'Millas-Vargas JP', 'Fuentes-Retamal S', 'Correa P', 'Carrillo I', 'Aguilera RJ', 'Miranda D', 'Chavez-Baez I', 'Pulgar R', 'Urra FA', 'Varela-Ramirez A', 'Araya-Maturana R']","['Instituto de Quimica de Recursos Naturales, Universidad de Talca, Chile; Programa de Investigacion Asociativa en Cancer Gastrico, Universidad de Talca, Chile.', 'Border Biomedical Research Center, Department of Biological Sciences, The University of Texas at El Paso, USA.', 'Border Biomedical Research Center, Department of Biological Sciences, The University of Texas at El Paso, USA.', 'Border Biomedical Research Center, Department of Biological Sciences, The University of Texas at El Paso, USA.', 'Instituto de Quimica de Recursos Naturales, Universidad de Talca, Chile; Network for Snake Venom Research and Drug Discovery, Santiago, Chile.', 'Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology Program, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, University of Chile, Santiago, Chile; Programa de Investigacion Asociativa en Cancer Gastrico, Universidad de Talca, Chile; Network for Snake Venom Research and Drug Discovery, Santiago, Chile.', 'Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology Program, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, University of Chile, Santiago, Chile; Network for Snake Venom Research and Drug Discovery, Santiago, Chile.', 'Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology Program, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, University of Chile, Santiago, Chile.', 'Border Biomedical Research Center, Department of Biological Sciences, The University of Texas at El Paso, USA.', 'Departamento de Bioquimica y Biologia Molecular, Facultad de Ciencias Quimicas y Farmaceuticas, Universidad de Chile, Santiago, Chile.', 'Network for Snake Venom Research and Drug Discovery, Santiago, Chile; Laboratorio de Genomica y Genetica de Interacciones Biologicas, INTA-Universidad de Chile, Santiago, Chile.', 'Network for Snake Venom Research and Drug Discovery, Santiago, Chile; Laboratorio de Genomica y Genetica de Interacciones Biologicas, INTA-Universidad de Chile, Santiago, Chile.', 'Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology Program, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, University of Chile, Santiago, Chile; Network for Snake Venom Research and Drug Discovery, Santiago, Chile.

The cytotoxicity, progenin III-induced autophagic, ferroptotic and necroptotic cell death were evaluated by the resazurin reduction assay (RRA). Spectrophotometric analysis of caspases activity was performed using caspase-Glo assay. Flow cytometry was applied for cell cycle analysis (PI staining), apoptosis (annexin V/PI staining), mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) (JC-1) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) (H2DCFH-DA). Progenin III and the reference molecule, doxorubicin exerted cytotoxic effects towards the 18 cancer cell lines tested including animal and human cell lines. The IC50 values obtained ranged from 1.59 muM (towards CCRF-CEM leukemia cells) to 31.61 muM (against the BRAF-V600E homozygous mutant SKMel-28 melanoma cells) for progenin III. Normal sensitivity was achieved with CEM/ADR5000 cells and HCT116p53(-/-) adenocarcinoma cells respectively compared to their sensitive congeners CCRF-CEM cells and HCT116 p53(+/+) cells. Progenin III induced apoptosis in CCRF-CEM cells mediated by caspases 3/7 activation, MMP alteration and increase ROS production, and otherwise autophagy and necroptosis. Progenin III is a potential anticancer molecule that deserves further investigations to develop a novel drug to combat malignant diseases including refractory cancers.","['Mbaveng, Armelle T', 'Chi, Godloves F', 'Nguenang, Gaelle S', 'Abdelfatah, Sara', 'Tchangna Sop, Rodrigue V', 'Ngadjui, Bonaventure T', 'Kuete, Victor', 'Efferth, Thomas']","['Mbaveng AT', 'Chi GF', 'Nguenang GS', 'Abdelfatah S', 'Tchangna Sop RV', 'Ngadjui BT', 'Kuete V', 'Efferth T']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Biology, Institute of Pharmacy and Biochemistry, University of Mainz, Staudinger Weg 5, 55128, Mainz, Germany; Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Science, University of Dschang, Dschang, Cameroon.

However, efficacy data is sparse in subgroups of patients with high-risk features such as BCR-ABL+, TP53 mutation, extramedullary disease (including central nervous system leukemia) or posttransplant relapse. It is also uncertain whether there is an added benefit of transplantation after anti-CD19 CAR T-cell therapy. We conducted a phase 1/2 study of 115 enrolled patients with CD19+ B-ALL. A total of 110 patients were successfully infused with anti-CD19 CAR T cells. In all, 93% of patients achieved a morphologic complete remission, and 87% became negative for minimal residual disease. Efficacy was seen across all subgroups. One-year leukemia-free survival (LFS) was 58%, and 1-year overall survival (OS) was 64% for the 110 patients. Seventy-five nonrandomly selected patients (73.5%) subsequently received an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (allo-HSCT). LFS (76.9% vs 11.6%; P < .0001; 95% confidence interval [CI], 11.6-108.4) and OS (79.1% vs 32.0%; P < .0001; 95% CI, 0.02-0.22) were significantly better among patients who subsequently received allo-HSCT compared with those receiving CAR T-cell therapy alone. This was confirmed in multivariable analyses (hazard ratio, 16.546; 95% CI, 5.499-49.786). Another variate that correlated with worse outcomes was TP53 mutation (hazard ratio, 0.235; 95% CI, 0.089-0.619). There were no differences in complete remission rate, OS, or LFS between groups of patients age 2 to 14 years or age older than 14 years. Most patients had only mild cytokine release syndrome and neurotoxicity. Our data indicate that anti-CD19 CAR T-cell therapy is safe and effective in all B-ALL subgroups that have high-risk features. The benefit of a subsequent allo-HSCT requires confirmation because of nonrandom allocation.

However, its applicability in low- and middle-income countries is limited because of a lack of full cytogenetic and molecular information at diagnosis. Here, we propose an alternative for risk stratification (the Adapted Genetic Risk [AGR]), which permits cytogenetic or molecular missing data while retaining prognostic power. We first analyzed 167 intensively treated patients with nonacute promyelocytic leukemia AML enrolled in Sao Paulo, Brazil (Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Sao Paulo), as our training data set, using ELN2017 as the standard for comparison with our AGR. Next, we combined our AGR with clinical prognostic parameters found in a Cox proportional hazards model to create a novel scoring system (survival AML score, SAMLS) that stratifies patients with newly diagnosed AML. Finally, we have used 2 independent test cohorts, Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto (FMRP; Brazil, n = 145) and Oxford University Hospitals (OUH; United Kingdom, n = 157) for validating our findings. AGR was statistically significant for overall survival (OS) in both test cohorts (FMRP, P = .037; OUH, P = .012) and disease-free survival in FMRP (P = .04). The clinical prognostic features in SAMLS were age (>45 years), white blood cell count (<1.5 or >30.0 x 103/muL), and low albumin levels (<3.8 g/dL), which were associated with worse OS in all 3 cohorts. SAMLS showed a significant difference in OS in the training cohort (P < .001) and test cohorts (FMRP, P = .0018; OUH, P < .001). Therefore, SAMLS, which incorporates the novel AGR evaluation with clinical parameters, is an accurate tool for AML risk assessment.","['Silveira, Douglas R A', 'Quek, Lynn', 'Santos, Itamar S', 'Corby, Anna', 'Coelho-Silva, Juan L', 'Pereira-Martins, Diego A', 'Vallance, Grant', 'Brown, Benjamin', 'Nardinelli, Luciana', 'Silva, Wellington F', 'Velloso, Elvira D R P', 'Lucena-Araujo, Antonio R', 'Traina, Fabiola', 'Peniket, Andy', 'Vyas, Paresh', 'Rego, Eduardo M', 'Bendit, Israel', 'Rocha, Vanderson']","['Silveira DRA', 'Quek L', 'Santos IS', 'Corby A', 'Coelho-Silva JL', 'Pereira-Martins DA', 'Vallance G', 'Brown B', 'Nardinelli L', 'Silva WF', 'Velloso EDRP', 'Lucena-Araujo AR', 'Traina F', 'Peniket A', 'Vyas P', 'Rego EM', 'Bendit I', 'Rocha V']","['Service of Hematology, Transfusion and Cell Therapy and Laboratory of Medical Investigation in Pathogenesis and Directed Therapy in Onco-Immuno-Hematology, HCFMUSP, University of Sao Paulo Medical School, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Department of Hematology, AC Camargo Cancer Center, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Medical Research Council MHU, BRC Hematology Theme, Oxford Biomedical Research Center, Oxford Center for Hematology, WIMM, Radcliffe Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Hematology, Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Oxford, United Kingdom.', 'Internal Medicine Department, Faculdade de Medicina, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Medical Research Council MHU, BRC Hematology Theme, Oxford Biomedical Research Center, Oxford Center for Hematology, WIMM, Radcliffe Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Medical Images, Hematology and Clinical Oncology, University of Sao Paulo at Ribeirao Preto Medical School, Ribeirao Preto, Brazil.', 'Department of Medical Images, Hematology and Clinical Oncology, University of Sao Paulo at Ribeirao Preto Medical School, Ribeirao Preto, Brazil.', 'Department of Hematology, Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Oxford, United Kingdom.', 'Medical Research Council MHU, BRC Hematology Theme, Oxford Biomedical Research Center, Oxford Center for Hematology, WIMM, Radcliffe Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.', 'Service of Hematology, Transfusion and Cell Therapy and Laboratory of Medical Investigation in Pathogenesis and Directed Therapy in Onco-Immuno-Hematology, HCFMUSP, University of Sao Paulo Medical School, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Leukemia Unit, Cancer Institute of Sao Paulo, University of Sao Paulo Medical School, Sao Paulo, Brazil;

We conducted a retrospective multicenter cohort analysis of 239 ALL patients (227 relapsed refractory [RR], n = 227; minimal residual disease [MRD], n = 12) who received blinatumomab outside of clinical trials to evaluate safety and efficacy in the ""real-world"" setting. The median age of patients at blinatumomab initiation was 48 years (range, 18-85). Sixty-one (26%) patients had >/=3 prior therapies and 46 (19%) had allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation before blinatumomab. The response rate (complete remission/complete remission with incomplete count recovery) in patients with RR disease was 65% (47% MRD-). Among 12 patients who received blinatumomab for MRD, 9 (75%) patients achieved MRD negativity. In patients with RR disease, median relapse-free survival and overall survival (OS) after blinatumomab was 32 months and 12.7 months, respectively. Among patients who received blinatumomab for MRD, median relapse-free survival was not reached (54% MRD- at 2 years) and OS was 34.7 months. Grade >/=3 cytokine release syndrome, neurotoxicity, and hepatotoxicity were observed in 3%, 7%, and 10% of patients, respectively. Among patients who achieved complete remission/complete remission with incomplete count recovery, consolidation therapy with allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation retained favorable prognostic significance for OS (hazard ratio, 0.54; 95% confidence interval, 0.30-0.97; P = .04). In this largest ""real-world"" experience published to date, blinatumomab demonstrated responses comparable to those reported in clinical trials.

Viral proteins have, therefore, evolved biological functions, such as signalling potential, that alter host cell physiology in ways that are still incompletely understood. Retroviral envelope glycoproteins interact with several host proteins, extracellularly with their cellular receptor and anti-envelope antibodies, and intracellularly with proteins of the cytoskeleton or sorting, endocytosis and recirculation pathways. Here, we examined the impact of endogenous retroviral envelope glycoprotein expression and interaction with host proteins, particularly antibodies, on the cell, independently of retroviral infection. We found that in the commonly used C57BL/6 substrains of mice, where murine leukaemia virus (MLV) envelope glycoproteins are expressed by several endogenous MLV proviruses, the highest expressed MLV envelope glycoprotein is under the control of an immune-responsive cellular promoter, thus linking MLV envelope glycoprotein expression with immune activation. We further showed that antibody ligation induces extensive internalisation from the plasma membrane into endocytic compartments of MLV envelope glycoproteins, which are not normally subject to constitutive endocytosis. Importantly, antibody binding and internalisation of MLV envelope glycoproteins initiates signalling cascades in envelope-expressing murine lymphocytic cell lines, leading to cellular activation. Similar effects were observed by MLV envelope glycoprotein ligation by its cellular receptor mCAT-1, and by overexpression in human lymphocytic cells, where it required an intact tyrosine-based YXXPhi motif in the envelope glycoprotein cytoplasmic tail. Together, these results suggest that signalling potential is a general property of retroviral envelope glycoproteins and, therefore, a target for intervention.","['Panova, Veera', 'Attig, Jan', 'Young, George R', 'Stoye, Jonathan P', 'Kassiotis, George']","['Panova V', 'Attig J', 'Young GR', 'Stoye JP', 'Kassiotis G']","['Retroviral Immunology, The Francis Crick Institute, United Kingdom.', 'Retroviral Immunology, The Francis Crick Institute, United Kingdom.', 'Retrovirus-Host Interactions, The Francis Crick Institute, London, United Kingdom.', 'Retrovirus-Host Interactions, The Francis Crick Institute, London, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom.', 'Retroviral Immunology, The Francis Crick Institute, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['102898/B/13/Z/WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', 'MC_U117512710/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'CRUK_/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200526,United States,PLoS Pathog,PLoS pathogens,101238921,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Calcium Channels)', '0 (TRPV Cation Channels)', '0 (Trpv6 protein, mouse)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/*immunology', 'Calcium Channels/*immunology', 'Cell Membrane/*immunology', 'Endocytosis/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'TRPV Cation Channels/*immunology', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*immunology']",PMC7274472,,,2020/05/27 06:00,2020/07/22 06:00,['2020/05/27 06:00'],"['2020/02/17 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/05 00:00 [revised]', '2020/05/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/22 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/27 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1371/journal.ppat.1008605 [doi]', 'PPATHOGENS-D-20-00308 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS Pathog. 2020 May 26;16(5):e1008605. doi: 10.1371/journal.ppat.1008605. eCollection 2020 May.,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-8433-6430', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2159-2880', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1203-588X', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3377-323X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8457-2633']",['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have previously shown that Tax hijacks and aberrantly activates ring finger protein 8 (RNF8) - a lysine 63 (K63)-specific ubiquitin E3 ligase critical for DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair signaling - to assemble K63-linked polyubiquitin chains (K63-pUbs) in the cytosol. Tax and the cytosolic K63-pUbs, in turn, initiate additional recruitment of linear ubiquitin assembly complex (LUBAC) to produce hybrid K63-M1 pUbs, which trigger a kinase cascade that leads to canonical IKK:NF-kappaB activation. Here we demonstrate that HTLV-1-infected cells are impaired in DNA damage response (DDR). This impairment correlates with the induction of microscopically visible nuclear speckles by Tax known as the Tax-speckle structures (TSS), which act as pseudo DNA damage signaling scaffolds that sequester DDR factors such as BRCA1, DNA-PK, and MDC1. We show that TSS co-localize with Tax, RNF8 and K63-pUbs, and their formation depends on RNF8. Tax mutants defective or attenuated in inducing K63-pUb assembly are deficient or tempered in TSS induction and DDR impairment. Finally, our results indicate that loss of RNF8 expression reduces HTLV-1 viral gene expression and frequently occurs in ATL cells. Thus, during HTLV-1 infection, Tax activates RNF8 to assemble nuclear K63-pUbs that sequester DDR factors in Tax speckles, disrupting DDR signaling and DSB repair. Down-regulation of RNF8 expression is positively selected during infection and progression to disease, and further exacerbates the genomic instability of ATL.","['Zhi, Huijun', 'Guo, Xin', 'Ho, Yik-Khuan', 'Pasupala, Nagesh', 'Engstrom, Hampus Alexander Anders', 'Semmes, Oliver John', 'Giam, Chou-Zen']","['Zhi H', 'Guo X', 'Ho YK', 'Pasupala N', 'Engstrom HAA', 'Semmes OJ', 'Giam CZ']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences Bethesda, MD, United States of America.', 'Department of Microbiology and Molecular Cell Biology The Leroy T.

Treatment is acutely toxic with late sequelae. We hypothesized that dose-adjusted etoposide, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisone, and rituximab (DA-EPOCH-R) may obviate the need for highly dose-intensive chemotherapy in adults with Burkitt lymphoma. METHODS: We conducted a multicenter risk-adapted study of DA-EPOCH-R in untreated adult Burkitt lymphoma. Low-risk patients received three cycles without CNS prophylaxis, and high-risk patients received six cycles with intrathecal CNS prophylaxis or extended intrathecal treatment if leptomeninges were involved. The primary endpoint was event-free survival (EFS), and secondary endpoints were toxicity and predictors of EFS and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: Between 2010 and 2017, 113 patients were enrolled across 22 centers, and 98 (87%) were high risk. The median age was 49 (range, 18-86) years, and 62% were >/= 40 years. Bone marrow and/or CSF was involved in 29 (26%) of patients, and 28 (25%) were HIV positive. At a median follow-up of 58.7 months, EFS and OS were 84.5% and 87.0%, respectively, and EFS was 100% and 82.1% in low- and high-risk patients. Therapy was equally effective across age groups, HIV status, and International Prognostic Index risk groups. Involvement of the CSF identified the group at greatest risk for early toxicity-related death or treatment failure. Five treatment-related deaths (4%) occurred during therapy.

The nanoform increased the transfection efficiency of Bmi1 siRNA through caveolae-mediated endocytosis and enhanced Bax translocation into the mitochondria. It enhanced the caspase 3-mediated apoptosis through the Bax activation and Bcl-2 inhibition. The molecular analysis reveals the downregulation of polycomb proteins, Bmi1 and EzH2, along with inhibition of H3K27me3 and H2AK119ub1. The signaling cascade revealed downregulation of Bmi1 through ubiquitin-mediated degradation and is reversed by a proteasome inhibitor. Further mechanistic studies established a crucial role of transcription factor, C-Myb and Bmi1, as its direct targets for maintenance and progression of AML. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay confirmed Bmi1 as a direct target of C-Myb as it binds to promoter sequence of Bmi1 between -235 to +43 and -111 to +43. The in vivo studies performed in the AML xenograft model evidence a decrease in the population of leukemic stem cells marker (CD45(+)) and an increase in the myeloid differentiating marker expression (CD11b(+)) in the bone marrow after the Bmi1 siRNA nanoconjugated therapy. Activation of apoptotic pathways and withdrawal of epigenetic repression through a ubiquitin proteasomal pathway potentiating a novel antileukemic therapy were established.","['Kushwaha, Avinash Chandra', 'Mohanbhai, Soni Jignesh', 'Sardoiwala, Mohammed Nadim', 'Sood, Ankur', 'Karmakar, Surajit', 'Roy Choudhury, Subhasree']","['Kushwaha AC', 'Mohanbhai SJ', 'Sardoiwala MN', 'Sood A', 'Karmakar S', 'Roy Choudhury S']","['Institute of Nano Science and Technology, Habitat Centre, Phase 10, Sector 64, Mohali, Punjab 160062, India.', 'Institute of Nano Science and Technology, Habitat Centre, Phase 10, Sector 64, Mohali, Punjab 160062, India.', 'Institute of Nano Science and Technology, Habitat Centre, Phase 10, Sector 64, Mohali, Punjab 160062, India.', 'Institute of Nano Science and Technology, Habitat Centre, Phase 10, Sector 64, Mohali, Punjab 160062, India.', 'Institute of Nano Science and Technology, Habitat Centre, Phase 10, Sector 64, Mohali, Punjab 160062, India.', 'Institute of Nano Science and Technology, Habitat Centre, Phase 10, Sector 64, Mohali, Punjab 160062, India.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200526,United States,ACS Appl Mater Interfaces,ACS applied materials & interfaces,101504991,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BMI1 protein, human)', '0 (Drug Carriers)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '9002-98-6 (Polyethyleneimine)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 1)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)', 'ZIF514RVZR (Serum Albumin, Human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Drug Carriers/*chemistry', 'Epigenesis, Genetic/drug effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Nanocomposites/chemistry/*therapeutic use', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Polyethyleneimine/chemistry', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/metabolism', 'Proteolysis/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/antagonists & inhibitors', 'RNA, Small Interfering/*therapeutic use', 'Serum Albumin, Human/chemistry', 'Ubiquitination/drug effects', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Bmi1 siRNA', 'RNAi', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'epigenetics', 'polycomb', 'ubiquitin ligase']",2020/05/27 06:00,2021/03/31 06:00,['2020/05/27 06:00'],"['2020/05/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/31 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/27 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/acsami.0c06186 [doi]'],ppublish,ACS Appl Mater Interfaces. 2020 Jun 10;12(23):25633-25644. doi: 10.1021/acsami.0c06186.

The microarray dataset reorganization and its classification is more complex and expensive in the biomedical research area due to the larger number of features in the microarray dataset. In this paper, we construct a hybrid feature selection method such as t test, Fisher ration, and Bayesian logistic regression to select genes and that reduce the time cost. Based on the features, the top-ranked features are selected via the best hybrid rank method. Thereafter, the features are extracted using the modified firefly optimization-based discriminant independent component analysis (MF-DICA). Especially, the modified firefly optimization algorithm is capable of improving the search efficiency of DICA. From the high dimensional microarray dataset, MF-DICA is used to obtain the best features within the entire search space. The kernel extreme learning machine classifies the gene features depending upon the most relevant class. Experimentally, six datasets namely Leukemia dataset, Diffuse Larger B-cell Lymphomas, Lung cancer, Breast cancer, Prostate tumor, and Colon dataset are chosen to evaluate the performance of proposed approaches. Finally, the experimental data demonstrate that the proposed method is well suitable to classify the microarray data.","['Nguyen, Tram Thi Huyen', 'Nguyen, Pol Van', 'Tran, Quang Vinh', 'Vo, Nam Xuan', 'Vo, Trung Quang']","['Nguyen TTH', 'Nguyen PV', 'Tran QV', 'Vo NX', 'Vo TQ']","['Department of Pharmacy, Ear - Nose - Throat Hospital in Ho Chi Minh city, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.', 'Department of Economic and Administrative Pharmacy, Faculty of Pharmacy, Pham Ngoc Thach University of Medicine, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.', 'Department of Economic and Administrative Pharmacy, Faculty of Pharmacy, Pham Ngoc Thach University of Medicine, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.', 'Department of Economic and Administrative Pharmacy, Faculty of Pharmacy, Ton Duc Thang University, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.', 'Department of Economic and Administrative Pharmacy, Faculty of Pharmacy, Pham Ngoc Thach University of Medicine, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200701,England,Int J Numer Method Biomed Eng,International journal for numerical methods in biomedical engineering,101530293,,IM,"['*Algorithms', 'Bayes Theorem', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Genomics', 'Humans', '*Neoplasms/genetics']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*dataset', '*gene selection', '*kernel extreme learning machine', '*microarray', '*modified firefly based discriminant independent component analysis']",2020/05/27 06:00,2021/11/09 06:00,['2020/05/27 06:00'],"['2020/02/10 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/08 00:00 [revised]', '2020/05/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/09 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/27 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cnm.3372 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Numer Method Biomed Eng. 2020 Sep;36(9):e3372. doi: 10.1002/cnm.3372.

To the authors' knowledge, it remains unknown whether trial enrollment has a clinical benefit compared with the best alternative standard therapy and/or off trial (ie, clinical trial effect). The authors conducted a retrospective matched cohort study to compare the morbidity and mortality of pediatric patients with cancer who are treated on a phase 3 clinical trial compared with those receiving standard therapy and/or off trial. METHODS: Subjects were aged birth to 19 years; were diagnosed between 2000 and 2010 with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), rhabdomyosarcoma, or neuroblastoma; and had received initial treatment at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. On-trial and off-trial subjects were matched based on age, race, ethnicity, a diagnosis of Down syndrome (for patients with ALL or AML), prognostic risk level, date of diagnosis, and tumor type. RESULTS: A total of 428 participants were matched in 214 pairs (152 pairs for ALL, 24 pairs for AML, 32 pairs for rhabdomyosarcoma, and 6 pairs for neuroblastoma). The 5-year survival rate did not differ between those treated on trial versus those treated with standard therapy and/or off trial (86.9% vs 82.2%; P = .093). On-trial patients had a 32% lower odds of having worse (higher) mortality-morbidity composite scores, although this did not reach statistical significance (odds ratio, 0.68; 95% confidence interval, 0.45-1.03 [P = .070]). CONCLUSIONS: There was no statistically significant difference in outcomes noted between those patients treated on trial and those treated with standard therapy and/or off trial. However, in partial support of the clinical trial effect, the results of the current study indicate a trend toward more favorable outcomes in children treated on trial compared with those treated with standard therapy and/or off trial. These findings can support decision making regarding enrollment in pediatric phase 3 clinical trials.","['Schapira, Marilyn M', 'Stevens, Evelyn M', 'Sharpe, James E', 'Hochman, Lauren', 'Reiter, Joseph G', 'Calhoun, Shawna R', 'Shah, Shivani A', 'Bailey, Leonard Charles', 'Bagatell, Rochelle', 'Silber, Jeffrey H', 'Tai, Eric', 'Barakat, Lamia P']","['Schapira MM', 'Stevens EM', 'Sharpe JE', 'Hochman L', 'Reiter JG', 'Calhoun SR', 'Shah SA', 'Bailey LC', 'Bagatell R', 'Silber JH', 'Tai E', 'Barakat LP']","['Department of Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.', 'Center for Health Equity Research and Promotion (CHERP), Philadelphia VA Medical Center, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.', ""Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA."", ""Center for Outcomes Resarch, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA."", ""Center for Outcomes Resarch, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA."", ""Center for Outcomes Resarch, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA."", ""Center for Outcomes Resarch, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA."", ""Center for Outcomes Resarch, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA."", 'Division of Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.', ""Department of Biomedical and Health Informatics, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA."", ""Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA."", 'Division of Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.', ""Center for Outcomes Resarch, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA."", 'Division of Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.', 'Department of Anesthesiology and Critical Care, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.', 'Department of Health Care Management, Wharton School, The University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.', 'Division of Cancer Prevention and Control, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia, USA.', ""Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA."", 'Division of Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.']",['eng'],['1U48DP005053/Centers of Disease Control and Prevention Cooporative'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase III', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",20200526,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/epidemiology/pathology', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/epidemiology/pathology', 'Neuroblastoma/drug therapy/epidemiology/pathology', '*Pediatrics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/epidemiology/pathology', '*Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Rhabdomyosarcoma/drug therapy/epidemiology/pathology', 'Treatment Outcome', 'United States/epidemiology', 'Young Adult']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*clinical trial', '*outcomes assessment', '*pediatric oncology', '*retrospective studies', '*trial effect']",2020/05/27 06:00,2021/05/21 06:00,['2020/05/27 06:00'],"['2019/12/16 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/31 00:00 [revised]', '2020/03/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/21 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/27 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.32947 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2020 Aug 1;126(15):3471-3482. doi: 10.1002/cncr.32947.

Overexpression of the transporter proteins, such as P-glycoprotein (Pgp) and multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP), confers resistance to the treatment of these leukemias. METHODS: To analyze the expression of the Pgp and MRP1 in patients with AML and determine their correlation between expression and demographic, clinical, and laboratorial variables, bone marrow and peripheral blood samples from 346 patients with a diagnosis of AML were assessed for the expression of Pgp and MRP1 by flow cytometry. RESULTS: The expression of Pgp and MRP1 was found in 111 (32.1%) and 133 (38.4%) patients, respectively, with greater prevalence in older patients and lower in children, while also observing a high incidence in patients with refractory, recurrence, and secondary disease in comparison with the cases of de novo AML. Regarding the laboratory findings, we observed an association between the expression of Pgp and MRP1 and CD34, CD7, and also M7, M5a, and M2-AML of French-American-British classification. CONCLUSIONS: The results showed that the detection of MDR phenotype by flow cytometry can be a molecular marker for prognosis of patients with AML.","['da Silveira Junior, Lenilton Silva', 'Soares, Victor de Lima', 'Jardim da Silva, Alessandra Suelen', 'Gil, Erica Aires', 'Pereira de Araujo, Maria das Gracas', 'Merces Goncalves, Ciro Alexandre', 'Paiva, Aldair de Souza', 'Moura de Oliveira, Taissa Maria', 'Oliveira, Gustavo Henrique de Medeiros', 'Kramer Cavacanti E Silva, Dany Geraldo', 'de Araujo Moura Lemos, Telma Maria', 'Moretti Rebecchi, Ivanise Marina', 'de Farias Sales, Valeria Soraya', 'Luchessi, Andre Ducati', 'Cavalcanti Junior, Geraldo Barroso']","['da Silveira Junior LS', 'Soares VL', 'Jardim da Silva AS', 'Gil EA', 'Pereira de Araujo MDG', 'Merces Goncalves CA', 'Paiva AS', 'Moura de Oliveira TM', 'Oliveira GHM', 'Kramer Cavacanti E Silva DG', 'de Araujo Moura Lemos TM', 'Moretti Rebecchi IM', 'de Farias Sales VS', 'Luchessi AD', 'Cavalcanti Junior GB']","['Departamento de Analises Clinicas e Toxicologicas, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Norte (DACT/UFRN), Natal, Brazil.', 'Departamento de Analises Clinicas e Toxicologicas, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Norte (DACT/UFRN), Natal, Brazil.', 'Departamento de Analises Clinicas e Toxicologicas, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Norte (DACT/UFRN), Natal, Brazil.', 'Faculdade de Ciencias da Saude do Trairi/UFRN, Santa Cruz, Brazil.', 'Departamento de Analises Clinicas e Toxicologicas, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Norte (DACT/UFRN), Natal, Brazil.', 'Departamento de Analises Clinicas e Toxicologicas, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Norte (DACT/UFRN), Natal, Brazil.', 'Laboratorio de Citometria de Fluxo, Hemocentro Dalton Cunha, Natal, Brazil.', 'Departamento de Analises Clinicas e Toxicologicas, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Norte (DACT/UFRN), Natal, Brazil.', 'Laboratorio de Citometria de Fluxo, Hemocentro Dalton Cunha, Natal, Brazil.', 'Departamento de Analises Clinicas e Toxicologicas, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Norte (DACT/UFRN), Natal, Brazil.', 'Departamento de Analises Clinicas e Toxicologicas, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Norte (DACT/UFRN), Natal, Brazil.', 'Laboratorio de Citometria de Fluxo, Hemocentro Dalton Cunha, Natal, Brazil.', 'Faculdade de Ciencias da Saude do Trairi/UFRN, Santa Cruz, Brazil.', 'Departamento de Analises Clinicas e Toxicologicas, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Norte (DACT/UFRN), Natal, Brazil.', 'Departamento de Analises Clinicas e Toxicologicas, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Norte (DACT/UFRN), Natal, Brazil.', 'Departamento de Analises Clinicas e Toxicologicas, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Norte (DACT/UFRN), Natal, Brazil.', 'Departamento de Analises Clinicas e Toxicologicas, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Norte (DACT/UFRN), Natal, Brazil.', 'Departamento de Analises Clinicas e Toxicologicas, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Norte (DACT/UFRN), Natal, Brazil.', 'Laboratorio de Citometria de Fluxo, Hemocentro Dalton Cunha, Natal, Brazil.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200526,England,Int J Lab Hematol,International journal of laboratory hematology,101300213,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins)', 'Y49M64GZ4Q (multidrug resistance-associated protein 1)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*genetics/metabolism', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/*genetics/metabolism/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Phenotype', 'Prognosis', 'Symptom Assessment', 'Young Adult']",,['NOTNLM'],"['P-glycoprotein', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'multidrug resistance', 'multidrug resistance-associated protein1']",2020/05/27 06:00,2021/02/09 06:00,['2020/05/27 06:00'],"['2020/01/23 00:00 [received]', '2020/04/14 00:00 [revised]', '2020/04/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/09 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/27 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ijlh.13241 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Lab Hematol. 2020 Oct;42(5):594-603. doi: 10.1111/ijlh.13241.

METHOD: Retrospective observational study of patients who underwent allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation between May 2017 and May 2018. Analyses were carried out between 0 and +100 days post-engraftment. Whenever possible, adherence to mycophenolate, tacrolimus, sirolimus, posaconazole, voriconazole and valganciclovir was evaluated by means of the dispensation records of the Pharmacy Department of our hospital. To be considered adherent, patients should have proved an adherence rate equal to or higher than 95%. Adherence to cyclosporine was determined based on serum levels. Patients were considered to be non-adherent if their cyclosporine serum concentrations dropped below 100 ng/mL at any time between days 0 and +100, in the absence of any specific justifying circumstances. The association between adherence and the inci dence of acute complications (secondary graft failure, acute graft-versushost disease and infection) was determined by means of the odds ratio (confidence interval: 95%). RESULTS: The study sample was made up by 46 patients, all of whom were started on immunosuppressive cyclosporine prophylaxis; 8.7% needed to be switched to tacrolimus or sirolimus due to toxicity issues. All the patients received cyclosporine as prophylaxis against graft- versus-host disease. Mycophenolate was also administered in 41.3% of cases. A total of 82.6% patients were found to be adherent to their prophylaxis treatment against graft failure and 80.4% were found to be adherent to prophylaxis against graft-versus-host disease. All patients were adherent to anti-infection prophylaxis. The incidence of acute graft-versus-host disease in prophylaxisadherent patients was 45.9%, compared with 55.6% for non-adherent patients (odds ratio 0.68; confidence interval: 95% 0.157-2.943; p = 0.718). CONCLUSIONS: Patients undergoing allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation demonstrated acceptable adherence to prophylaxis against acute complications, although a considerable percentage of patients was found not to take their medication as prescribed. Correct adherence to immunosuppressants seems to reduce the risk of developing acute graftversus- host disease.","['Garcia-Basas, Lorena', 'Sanchez-Cuervo, Marina', 'Gomez de Salazar-Lopez de Silanes, Esther', 'Pueyo-Lopez, Cristina', 'Nunez-Torron-Stock, Claudia', 'Herrera-Puente, Pilar']","['Garcia-Basas L', 'Sanchez-Cuervo M', 'Gomez de Salazar-Lopez de Silanes E', 'Pueyo-Lopez C', 'Nunez-Torron-Stock C', 'Herrera-Puente P']","['Pharmacy Department, Hospital Universitario Ramon y Cajal, Madrid.

However, the population-based studies demonstrated that there was no marked improvement in the survival of patients after the 2000s. We aim to describe the clinical response and prognosis of adult patients diagnosed with APL and examine the change in these outcomes by the time period of diagnosis. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed thirty-six unselected APL patients who were diagnosed between September 2003 and February 2016. RESULTS: The probability of survival at two years was 58%, while disease-free survival (DFS) was 87%. The overall early death (ED) rate was 33% and remain stable over time [42% in 2003-2009 vs. 24% in 2010-2016 (p=.20)]. In addition, the 2-year overall survival (OS) rates were 47% in 2003-2009 and 70% in 2010-2016 (p=.29), and no differences were noted. Univariate analyses showed possible predictors of poor OS were defined as leukocytosis (>/=10x109/L), high Sanz score, hemorrhage, infection, disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC) at presentation and microgranular morphologic subtype. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that long-term survival remains low in APL patients, particularly related to a high ED rate. Initiatives to reduce ED are exceedingly substantial for improving the survival in APL.","['Akcay, Omer Faruk', 'Yeter, Haci Hasan', 'Buyukasik, Yahya']","['Akcay OF', 'Yeter HH', 'Buyukasik Y']","['Gazi University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Nephrology, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Gazi University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Nephrology, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Hacettepe University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Hematology, Ankara, Turkey.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Germany,Rom J Intern Med,Romanian journal of internal medicine = Revue roumaine de medecine interne,9304507,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation/etiology', 'Female', 'Hemorrhage/*etiology', 'Humans', 'Infections/etiology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/complications/*drug therapy/*mortality/pathology', 'Leukocytosis/etiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate/trends', 'Time Factors', 'Young Adult']",,['NOTNLM'],"['acute promyelocytic leukemia', 'early death', 'overall survival', 'predictors', 'real-life outcomes']",2020/05/27 06:00,2021/06/22 06:00,['2020/05/27 06:00'],"['2020/02/10 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/22 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/27 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.2478/rjim-2020-0011 [doi]', '/j/rjim.ahead-of-print/rjim-2020-0011/rjim-2020-0011.xml [pii]']",ppublish,Rom J Intern Med. 2020 Sep 1;58(3):138-145. doi: 10.2478/rjim-2020-0011.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we report a single-center experience of compassionate use of dactinomycin in untreated or relapsed/ refractory NPM1-mutated AML. METHODS: From September 2015 to February 2019, 26 adult patients with NPM1-mutated AML received dactinomycin in different situations: front-line treatment in 4 unfit patients (16%); morphologic (n = 16, 62%), molecular relapses (n = 4, 16%), refractory disease (n = 1, 13%), or postremission therapy in second complete response (n = 1, 13%). RESULTS: Median age was 62.5 years. Median number of dactinomycin cycle was 1 (1-8), and 7 patients (27%) received more than 3 cycles. Three out of 17 patients (18%) in morphologic relapse or refractory to chemotherapy achieved complete remission after the first cycle of dactinomycin. None of the 4 patients unfit for intensive chemotherapy responded to dactinomycin as front-line therapy. Grade 3-4 adverse events were thrombocytopenia (n = 11, 42%), neutropenia (n = 11, 42%), GI toxicity (n = 6, 23%), mucositis (n = 5, 19%), lung infection (n = 5, 19%), and skin rash (n = 2, 7.6%).

A direct comparison of BCL-2 inhibitors, navitoclax and venetoclax, was undertaken on LPC subpopulations from B-cell precursor (BCP) and T-cell ALL (T-ALL) cases in vitro and in vivo. Responses were compared to BCL-2 levels detected by microarray analyses and Western blotting. In vitro, both drugs were effective against most BCP-ALL LPC, except CD34(-) /CD19(-) cells. In contrast, only navitoclax was effective in T-ALL and CD34(-) /CD7(-) LPC were resistant to both drugs. In vivo, navitoclax was more effective than venetoclax, significantly improving survival of mice engrafted with BCP- and T-ALL samples. Venetoclax was not particularly effective against T-ALL cases in vivo. The proportions of CD34(+) /CD19(-) , CD34(-) /CD19(-) BCP-ALL cells and CD34(-) /CD7(-) T-ALL cells increased significantly following in vivo treatment. Expression of pro-apoptotic BCL-2 genes was lower in these subpopulations, which may explain the lack of sensitivity. These data demonstrate that some LPC were resistant to BCL-2 inhibitors and sustained remission will require their use in combination with other therapeutics.","['Diamanti, Paraskevi', 'Ede, Benjamin C', 'Dace, Phoebe Ei', 'Barendt, William J', 'Cox, Charlotte V', 'Hancock, Jeremy P', 'Moppett, John P', 'Blair, Allison']","['Diamanti P', 'Ede BC', 'Dace PE', 'Barendt WJ', 'Cox CV', 'Hancock JP', 'Moppett JP', 'Blair A']","['Bristol Institute for Transfusion Sciences, NHSBT Filton, Bristol, UK.', 'School of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK.', 'School of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK.', 'School of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK.', 'School of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK.', 'Bristol Institute for Transfusion Sciences, NHSBT Filton, Bristol, UK.', 'Bristol Genetics Laboratory, Severn Pathology, North Bristol Trust, Bristol, UK.', 'School of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK.', 'Bristol Royal Hospital for Children, Bristol, UK.', 'Bristol Institute for Transfusion Sciences, NHSBT Filton, Bristol, UK.', 'School of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK.']",['eng'],"['RP-PG-0310-1003/Programme Grants for Applied Research', 'National Institute for Health Research', 'NHS Blood and Transplant', 'WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', 'University of Bristol']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200525,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Aniline Compounds)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', 'N54AIC43PW (venetoclax)', 'XKJ5VVK2WD (navitoclax)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Aniline Compounds/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/analysis/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Sulfonamides/*therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome']",PMC8237230,['NOTNLM'],"['*ALL', '*BCL-2', '*LPC', '*NSG', '*Navitoclax', '*Venetoclax', '*paediatric ALL']",2020/05/27 06:00,2021/06/23 06:00,['2020/05/27 06:00'],"['2020/01/23 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/23 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/27 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/bjh.16773 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2021 Feb;192(3):577-588. doi: 10.1111/bjh.16773.

One hundred twenty-five adult patients with acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome who underwent first allo-HSCT between 2000 and 2017 were included. Sarcopenia was assessed using CT-based skeletal muscle index (SMI) and mean muscle attenuation at L3. A statistical difference in SMI was confirmed between sarcopenia (n = 52) and nonsarcopenia (n = 73) patients. There were no significant correlations of muscularity with age, performance status, or other characteristics of HSCT. After 2 years, overall survival (OS) was 43.5% and 70.1%, disease-free survival was 52.9% and 68.6%, nonrelapse mortality (NRM) was 20.8% and 8.4%, incidence of acute GVHD (>/= grade 2) was 38.8% and 39.1%, that of chronic GVHD was 53.2% and 37.3%, and median duration of hospitalization was 88 days and 74 days (P = 0.026), respectively, in the sarcopenia and nonsarcopenia groups. Multivariate analysis showed that presence of sarcopenia is a novel adverse factor for high NRM and poor OS. Pretransplant CT-defined sarcopenia is correlated with decreased OS, increased NRM, and prolonged hospitalization.","['Ando, Taiki', 'Fujisawa, Shin', 'Teshigawara, Haruka', 'Matsumura, Ayako', 'Sakuma, Takayuki', 'Suzuki, Taisei', 'Teranaka, Hiroshi', 'Ogusa, Eriko', 'Ishii, Yoshimi', 'Miyashita, Kazuho', 'Takahashi, Hiroyuki', 'Nakajima, Yuki', 'Miyazaki, Takuya', 'Hagihara, Maki', 'Matsumoto, Kenji', 'Yamazaki, Etsuko', 'Nakajima, Hideaki']","['Ando T', 'Fujisawa S', 'Teshigawara H', 'Matsumura A', 'Sakuma T', 'Suzuki T', 'Teranaka H', 'Ogusa E', 'Ishii Y', 'Miyashita K', 'Takahashi H', 'Nakajima Y', 'Miyazaki T', 'Hagihara M', 'Matsumoto K', 'Yamazaki E', 'Nakajima H']","['Department of Hematology, Yokohama City University Medical Center, 4-57 Urafune, Minami-ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan. taimo029@yahoo.co.jp.', 'Department of Hematology, Yokohama City University Medical Center, 4-57 Urafune, Minami-ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Clinical Immunology, Yokohama City University School of Medicine, Yokohama, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Clinical Immunology, Yokohama City University School of Medicine, Yokohama, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Clinical Immunology, Yokohama City University School of Medicine, Yokohama, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Yokohama City University Medical Center, 4-57 Urafune, Minami-ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Yokohama City University Medical Center, 4-57 Urafune, Minami-ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Yokohama City University Medical Center, 4-57 Urafune, Minami-ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Yokohama City University Medical Center, 4-57 Urafune, Minami-ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Yokohama City University Medical Center, 4-57 Urafune, Minami-ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Clinical Immunology, Yokohama City University School of Medicine, Yokohama, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Clinical Immunology, Yokohama City University School of Medicine, Yokohama, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Clinical Immunology, Yokohama City University School of Medicine, Yokohama, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Clinical Immunology, Yokohama City University School of Medicine, Yokohama, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Clinical Immunology, Yokohama City University School of Medicine, Yokohama, Japan.', 'Clinical Laboratory Department, Yokohama City University Hospital, Yokohama, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Clinical Immunology, Yokohama City University School of Medicine, Yokohama, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20200525,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*mortality', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications/*mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/complications/*mortality/*therapy', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sarcopenia/*diagnostic imaging/*etiology', '*Tomography, X-Ray Computed', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Young Adult']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Computed tomography', 'Myelodysplastic syndrome', 'Nonrelapse mortality', 'Sarcopenia']",2020/05/27 06:00,2020/10/30 06:00,['2020/05/27 06:00'],"['2019/12/23 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/25 00:00 [revised]', '2020/05/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/30 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/27 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12185-020-02870-5 [doi]', '10.1007/s12185-020-02870-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2020 Jul;112(1):46-56. doi: 10.1007/s12185-020-02870-5.

Although clinical response rates can be up to 93% in acute lymphoblastic leukemia, treatment-related antigen loss and lack of therapeutic persistence contribute to disease relapse. These shortcomings of current CAR T-cell therapy indicate the need for biologically relevant target selection and for improving the efficacy and persistence of the CAR T cells, which we have addressed by developing a novel B-cell activating factor receptor (BAFF-R) CAR T-cell therapy with improved therapeutic persistence. BAFF-R is a B-cell survival receptor and highly expressed in B-cell malignancies. We developed a prototype CAR T cell that efficiently and specifically eliminated BAFF-R expressing human B-cell tumors in several xenogeneic mouse models, including models of CD19 antigen loss. We proceeded with translational development and validation of BAFF-R CAR T cells produced under current good manufacturing practices (cGMP). cGMP-grade BAFF-R CAR T cells underwent in vitro and in vivo validation in established models to confirm that the potency and efficacy of our original research modeling was replicated. Food and Drug Administration required release testing was performed to ensure our BAFF-R CAR T cells meet specifications for new drug products.

B cell progenitors progress through sequential and mutually exclusive states of proliferation and recombination, coordinated by cytokines and chemokines. Mutations affecting the crucial pre-B cell checkpoint result in immunodeficiency, autoimmunity, and leukemia. This checkpoint was previously modeled by the signaling of two opposing receptors, IL-7R and the pre-BCR.

Protein methyltransferases form the prominent family of such proteins regulating gene expression via epigenetic mechanisms thereby representing novel targets for pharmacological intervention. Disruptor of telomeric silencing, hDot1L is the only non-SET domain containing histone methyltransferase that methylates histone H3 at lysine 79. H3K79 methylation mediated by hDot1L plays a crucial role in mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) pathosis. MLL fusion protein mediated mistargeting of DOT1L to aberrant gene locations results in ectopic H3K79 methylation culminating in aberrant expression of leukemogenic genes like HOXA9 and MEIS1. hDOT1L has thus been proposed as a potential target for therapeutic intervention in MLL. This review presents the general overview of hDOT1L and its functional role in distinct biological processes. Furthermore, we discuss various therapeutic strategies against hDOT1L as a promising drug target to vanquish therapeutically challenging MLL.","['Banday, Shahid', 'Farooq, Zeenat', 'Ganai, Shabir Ahmad', 'Altaf, Mohammad']","['Banday S', 'Farooq Z', 'Ganai SA', 'Altaf M']","['Chromatin and Epigenetics Lab, Department of Biotechnology, University of Kashmir, Hazratbal, Srinagar, 190006, India.', 'Chromatin and Epigenetics Lab, Department of Biotechnology, University of Kashmir, Hazratbal, Srinagar, 190006, India.', 'Chromatin and Epigenetics Lab, Department of Biotechnology, University of Kashmir, Hazratbal, Srinagar, 190006, India.', 'Present Address: Division of Basic Sciences and Humanities, Faculty of Agriculture, SKUAST-Kashmir, Wadura, Sopore, Jammu and Kashmir, 193201, India.', 'Chromatin and Epigenetics Lab, Department of Biotechnology, University of Kashmir, Hazratbal, Srinagar, 190006, India. altafbhat@uok.edu.in.', 'Centre for Interdisciplinary Research and Innovations, University of Kashmir, Hazratbal, Srinagar, 190006, India. altafbhat@uok.edu.in.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20200525,Germany,Clin Epigenetics,Clinical epigenetics,101516977,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Histones)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (DOT1L protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Histone Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Protein Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'K3Z4F929H6 (Lysine)']",IM,"['Chromatin/*genetics', 'DNA Repair/genetics', 'Drug Delivery Systems/methods', 'Epigenesis, Genetic/*genetics', 'Gene Silencing', 'Heterografts/metabolism', 'Histone Methyltransferases/metabolism', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/metabolism', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Lysine/metabolism', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*genetics', 'Protein Methyltransferases/metabolism']",PMC7249331,['NOTNLM'],"['*Chromatin', '*DNA repair', '*Gene expression', '*Histone methylation', '*Histone methyltransferases', '*Mixed lineage leukemia']",2020/05/27 06:00,2021/08/19 06:00,['2020/05/27 06:00'],"['2020/01/04 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/05/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/19 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13148-020-00860-2 [doi]', '10.1186/s13148-020-00860-2 [pii]']",epublish,Clin Epigenetics. 2020 May 25;12(1):73. doi: 10.1186/s13148-020-00860-2.,['ORCID: 0000-0002-0489-2128'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Drug resistance and disease recurrence almost invariably occur, highlighting the need for a deeper understanding of these processes. While low O2 compartments, such as bone marrow (BM) niches, are well-recognized hosts of drug-resistant leukaemic cells, standard in vitro studies are routinely performed under supra-physiologic (21% O2 , ambient air) conditions, which limits clinical translatability. We hereby identify molecular pathways enriched in AML cells that survive acute challenges with classic or targeted therapeutic agents. Experiments took into account variations in O2 tension encountered by leukaemic cells in clinical settings. Integrated RNA and protein profiles revealed that lipid biosynthesis, and particularly the cholesterol biogenesis branch, is a particularly therapy-induced vulnerability in AML cells under low O2 states. We also demonstrate that the impact of the cytotoxic agent cytarabine is selectively enhanced by a high-potency statin. The cholesterol biosynthesis programme is amenable to additional translational opportunities within the expanding AML therapeutic landscape. Our findings support the further investigation of higher-potency statin (eg rosuvastatin)-based combination therapies to enhance targeting residual AML cells that reside in low O2 environments.","['Chen, Fangli', 'Wu, Xue', 'Niculite, Cristina', 'Gilca, Marilena', 'Petrusca, Daniela', 'Rogozea, Adriana', 'Rice, Susan', 'Guo, Bin', 'Griffin, Shawn', 'Calin, George A', 'Boswell, H Scott', 'Konig, Heiko']","['Chen F', 'Wu X', 'Niculite C', 'Gilca M', 'Petrusca D', 'Rogozea A', 'Rice S', 'Guo B', 'Griffin S', 'Calin GA', 'Boswell HS', 'Konig H']","['Melvin and Bren Simon Cancer Center, Indiana University, Indianapolis, IN, USA.', 'Melvin and Bren Simon Cancer Center, Indiana University, Indianapolis, IN, USA.', 'Melvin and Bren Simon Cancer Center, Indiana University, Indianapolis, IN, USA.', ""University of Medicine and Pharmacy 'Carol Davila', Bucharest, Romania."", 'Melvin and Bren Simon Cancer Center, Indiana University, Indianapolis, IN, USA.', ""University of Medicine and Pharmacy 'Carol Davila', Bucharest, Romania."", 'Melvin and Bren Simon Cancer Center, Indiana University, Indianapolis, IN, USA.', 'Melvin and Bren Simon Cancer Center, Indiana University, Indianapolis, IN, USA.', 'Melvin and Bren Simon Cancer Center, Indiana University, Indianapolis, IN, USA.', 'Melvin and Bren Simon Cancer Center, Indiana University, Indianapolis, IN, USA.', 'Melvin and Bren Simon Cancer Center, Indiana University, Indianapolis, IN, USA.', 'Division of Cancer Medicine, Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Melvin and Bren Simon Cancer Center, Indiana University, Indianapolis, IN, USA.', 'Melvin and Bren Simon Cancer Center, Indiana University, Indianapolis, IN, USA.']",['eng'],"['1S10D012270/NH/NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA222007/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1R01CA182905-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UH3 TR000943/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA082709/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U54 DK106846/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', '1R01CA222007-01A1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA182905/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UH3TR00943-01/NH/NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200525,England,J Cell Mol Med,Journal of cellular and molecular medicine,101083777,"['0 (Benzothiazoles)', '0 (Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors)', '0 (Phenylurea Compounds)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '7LA4O6Q0D3 (quizartinib)', '83MVU38M7Q (Rosuvastatin Calcium)', '97C5T2UQ7J (Cholesterol)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics', 'Benzothiazoles/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Biosynthetic Pathways/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cholesterol/*biosynthesis', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Intracellular Space/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Phenylurea Compounds/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Rosuvastatin Calcium/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Translational Research, Biomedical', 'Young Adult']",PMC7339218,['NOTNLM'],"['*acute myeloid leukaemia', '*cholesterol', '*hypoxia', '*statins']",2020/05/26 06:00,2021/04/29 06:00,['2020/05/26 06:00'],"['2020/03/02 00:00 [received]', '2020/04/07 00:00 [revised]', '2020/04/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/29 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/26 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/jcmm.15339 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Mol Med. 2020 Jul;24(13):7378-7392. doi: 10.1111/jcmm.15339.

In this research, the physical interaction of GNSs on model membranes was investigated using artificial membranes and plasma membrane vesicles. The effects of the GNSs on plasma membrane, lysosomal and mitochondrial membranes were investigated using rat basophilic leukemia (RBL2H3) cells via lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay, acridine orange staining and JC-1 probe, respectively. The physical interaction with model membranes was dominated by electrostatic forces, and the adhered GNSs disrupted the membrane. The degree of physical membrane disruption was quantified by the quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation (QCM-D), confirming the serious membrane disruption. The internalized GNSs were mainly distributed in the lysosomes. They caused plasma membrane leakage, increased the lysosomal membrane permeability (LMP), and depolarized the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). The increased cellular levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were also detected after GNS exposure. The combination of physical interaction and the excess ROS production damaged the plasma and organelle membranes in living RBL-2H3 cells. The lysosomal and mitochondrial dysfunction, and the oxidative stress further induced cell apoptosis. Specially, the exposure to 25 mg/L GNSs caused severest cell mortality, plasma membrane damage, ROS generation, MMP depolarization and apoptosis. The research findings provide more comprehensive information on the graphene-induced plasma and organelle membrane damage, which is important to understand and predict the cytotoxicity of carbon-based nanomaterials.","['Liu, Ling', 'Zhang, Mengmeng', 'Zhang, Qiu', 'Jiang, Wei']","['Liu L', 'Zhang M', 'Zhang Q', 'Jiang W']","['Environment Research Institute, Shandong University, Qingdao 266237, China.', 'Environment Research Institute, Shandong University, Qingdao 266237, China.', 'School of Environmental Sciences and Engineering, Shandong University, Qingdao 266237, China.', 'Environment Research Institute, Shandong University, Qingdao 266237, China; Shenzhen Research Institute, Shandong University, Shenzhen 518057, China.

These mobilized CD34(+) cells have the potential to generate all blood cell types. For autologous transplantation, the minimal number of mobilized CD34(+) cells is 2x10(6) CD34(+) cells/kg body weight. However, up to 30% of patients fail to mobilize enough peripheral CD34(+) cells after G-CSF treatment. To overcome this limitation, a combination of G-CSF and Plerixafor, a CXCR4 chemokine receptor inhibitor, is proposed to enhance CD34(+) cell mobilization in poor mobilizer patients. However, only limited data are available on quantification of the functional quality of such patients' mobilized hematopoietic stem cells. Here, for six poor mobilizer patients, a head-to-head comparison of their CD34(+) cells mobilized without versus with Plerixafor was performed to assess their properties with respect to the reconstitution of human hematopoiesis in vivo in immune-deficient mice.

Linearity of DNA-binding, coefficients-of-variation of G0/G1-peaks and minimal carryover were confirmed. Assay results correlated highly with a propidium iodide-based kit in 29 acute lymphoblastic leukemia specimens. The MG-based DNA-ploidy assay represented an accurate and inexpensive alternative to conventional PI-based assays.","['Murgai, Pooja', 'Sharma, Prashant', 'Sachdeva, Man Updesh Singh', 'Bose, Parveen Lata', 'Gupta, Minakshi', 'Das, Reena', 'Varma, Neelam']","['Murgai P', 'Sharma P', 'Sachdeva MUS', 'Bose PL', 'Gupta M', 'Das R', 'Varma N']","['Department of Hematology, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India.', 'Department of Hematology, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India.

To address this issue, we assessed the impact of measurable MRD at CBT on outcomes in large cohort of patients with acute leukemia. Inclusion criteria included adult patients with acute myeloid (AML) or acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), CBT as first allo-HCT in first or second complete remission (CR) at transplantation, and known MRD status at the time of CBT. Data from 506 patients were included in the analysis. Among them, 317 patients had AML and 189 had ALL. Positive MRD was reported in 169 (33%) patients while the remaining 337 patients were MRD negative at CBT. At 2 years, relapse incidence was 18% in patients with MRD negativity vs 33% in those with MRD positivity at transplantation (P < .001). Two-year leukemia-free survival (LFS) and overall survival (OS) were 57% and 60%, respectively, in MRD negative patients, vs 38% (P < .001) and 48% (P = .004), respectively, in those with MRD positivity. There was no interaction between the impact of MRD on OS and LFS and diagnosis (ie, ALL vs AML), single or double CBT, and reduced-intensity or myeloablative conditioning. On multivariate analysis, MRD positivity was associated with a higher risk of relapse (HR = 1.8, P = .003), comparable non-relapse mortality (P = .44), worse LFS (HR = 1.4, P = .008) and a trend towards worse OS (HR = 1.3, P = .065). In conclusion, these data suggest that novel strategies that are aiming to achieve MRD negativity at CBT are needed for leukemic patients with positive MRD pre-CBT.","['Baron, Frederic', 'Labopin, Myriam', 'Ruggeri, Annalisa', 'Sierra, Jorge', 'Robinson, Stephen', 'Labussiere-Wallet, Helene', 'Potter, Michael', 'Ribera, Josep-Maria', 'Deconinck, Eric', 'Rambaldi, Alessandro', 'Rohrlich, Pierre-Simon', 'de Revel, Thierry', 'Gluckman, Eliane', 'Nagler, Arnon', 'Mohty, Mohamad']","['Baron F', 'Labopin M', 'Ruggeri A', 'Sierra J', 'Robinson S', 'Labussiere-Wallet H', 'Potter M', 'Ribera JM', 'Deconinck E', 'Rambaldi A', 'Rohrlich PS', 'de Revel T', 'Gluckman E', 'Nagler A', 'Mohty M']","['Laboratory of Hematology, GIGA-I3, University of Liege and CHU of Liege, Liege, Belgium.', 'EBMT Paris Study Office/CEREST-TC, Paris, France.', ""Service d'Hematologie Clinique et de Therapie cellulaire, APHP, Hopital Saint Antoine, Paris, France."", 'Centre de Recherche Saint-Antoine (CRSA), INSERM, Paris, France.', 'Sorbonne Universite, Paris, France.', 'Ospedale San Raffaele s.r.l., Haematology and BMT, Milan, Italy.', 'Eurocord, Hospital Saint Louis, AP-HP, and IUH University Paris VII, France; Monacord, Centre Scientifique de Monaco, Monaco, Monaco.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Santa Creu i Sant Pau, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Department of Haematology, Bristol Haematology Oncology Centre, University Hospital Bristol, Bristol, UK.', 'Service Hematologie, Centre Hospitalier Lyon Sud, Lyon, France.', 'Royal Marsden Hospital, Leukaemia Myeloma Units, London, UK.', 'Department of Clinical Hematology, ICO-Hospital Universitari Germans Trias i Pujol Josep Carreras Research Institute, Badalona, Spain.', ""Service d'Hematologie, Hopital Jean Minjoz, Besancon, France."", 'Department of Oncology and Hematology, University of Milan and Azienda Socio Sanitaria Territoriale, Papa Giovanni XXIII, Bergamo, Italy.', ""CHU Nice - Hopital de l'ARCHET I, Hematologie Clinique, Nice, France."", 'Department of Hematology, Hopital Americain, Clamart, France.', 'Eurocord, Hospital Saint Louis, AP-HP, and IUH University Paris VII, France; Monacord, Centre Scientifique de Monaco, Monaco, Monaco.', 'EBMT Paris Study Office/CEREST-TC, Paris, France.', 'Division of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, The Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel-Hashomer, Ramat-Gan, Israel.', 'EBMT Paris Study Office/CEREST-TC, Paris, France.', ""Service d'Hematologie Clinique et de Therapie cellulaire, APHP, Hopital Saint Antoine, Paris, France."", 'Centre de Recherche Saint-Antoine (CRSA), INSERM, Paris, France.', 'Sorbonne Universite, Paris, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200630,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Allografts', '*Cord Blood Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/mortality/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm, Residual', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/mortality/therapy', '*Registries', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate']",,,,2020/05/26 06:00,2020/12/30 06:00,['2020/05/26 06:00'],"['2020/04/14 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/08 00:00 [revised]', '2020/05/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/30 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/26 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.25879 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2020 Sep;95(9):1057-1065. doi: 10.1002/ajh.25879.

Some micro-/alt-proteins exhibit stress-, cell-type-, and/or tissue-specific expression; understanding this regulated expression will be critical to elucidating their functions. While differential translation has been inferred by ribosome profiling, quantitative mass spectrometry-based proteomics is needed for direct comparison of microprotein and alt-protein expression between samples and conditions. However, while label-free quantitative proteomics has been applied to detect stress-dependent expression of bacterial microproteins, this approach has not yet been demonstrated for analysis of differential expression of unannotated ORFs in the more complex human proteome. Here, we present global micro-/alt-protein quantitation in two human leukemia cell lines, K562 and MOLT4. We identify 12 unannotated proteins that are differentially expressed in these cell lines. The expression of six micro/alt-proteins from cDNA was validated biochemically, and two were found to localize to the nucleus. Thus, we demonstrate that label-free comparative proteomics enables quantitation of micro-/alt-protein expression between human cell lines. We anticipate that this workflow will enable the discovery of regulated sm/alt-ORF products across many biological conditions in human cells.","['Cao, Xiongwen', 'Khitun, Alexandra', 'Na, Zhenkun', 'Dumitrescu, Daniel G', 'Kubica, Marcelina', 'Olatunji, Elizabeth', 'Slavoff, Sarah A']","['Cao X', 'Khitun A', 'Na Z', 'Dumitrescu DG', 'Kubica M', 'Olatunji E', 'Slavoff SA']","['Department of Chemistry, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut 06520, United States.', 'Chemical Biology Institute, Yale University, West Haven, Connecticut06516, United States.', 'Department of Chemistry, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut 06520, United States.', 'Chemical Biology Institute, Yale University, West Haven, Connecticut06516, United States.', 'Department of Chemistry, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut 06520, United States.', 'Chemical Biology Institute, Yale University, West Haven, Connecticut06516, United States.', 'Department of Chemistry, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut 06520, United States.', 'Chemical Biology Institute, Yale University, West Haven, Connecticut06516, United States.', 'Chemical Biology Institute, Yale University, West Haven, Connecticut06516, United States.', 'Department of Chemistry, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut 06520, United States.', 'Chemical Biology Institute, Yale University, West Haven, Connecticut06516, United States.', 'Department of Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut06529, United States.']",['eng'],"['T32 GM067543/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 TR001863/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200603,United States,J Proteome Res,Journal of proteome research,101128775,['0 (Proteome)'],IM,"['Cell Line', 'Humans', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Open Reading Frames', '*Proteome/genetics', '*Proteomics']",PMC7429271,['NOTNLM'],"['*alternative protein', '*comparative proteomics', '*microprotein', '*proteogenomics', '*unannotated protein']",2020/05/26 06:00,2021/06/22 06:00,['2020/05/26 06:00'],"['2020/05/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/22 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/26 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/acs.jproteome.0c00254 [doi]'],ppublish,J Proteome Res. 2020 Aug 7;19(8):3418-3426. doi: 10.1021/acs.jproteome.0c00254.

We report results of UK TARGET CML, a retrospective observational study of 257 patients with chronic-phase CML who had been prescribed a first-line TKI between 2013 and 2017, most of whom received first-line imatinib (n = 203). Although 44% of patients required >/=1 change of TKI, these real-world data revealed that molecular assessments were frequently missed, 23% of patients with ELN-defined treatment failure did not switch TKI, and kinase domain mutation analysis was performed in only 49% of patients who switched TKI for resistance. Major molecular response (MMR; BCR-ABL1(IS) </=0.1%) and deep molecular response (DMR; BCR-ABL1(IS) </=0.01%) were observed in 50% and 29%, respectively, of patients treated with first-line imatinib, and 63% and 54%, respectively, receiving a second-generation TKI first line.

In particular, T-cell lymphoma is very rare in the lung, as a primary or secondary lesion. Patients with pulmonary T-cell lymphoma usually present with cough, dyspnea, pain, fever, recurrent infections, and hemoptysis. Typical radiologic features include pulmonary nodules, consolidation, solid pulmonary opacities, cystic changes, hilar adenopathy, and pleural effusions. Patients with these clinical and radiologic findings are frequently presumed to have pneumonia and initially treated with empirical antibiotics. Therefore, CT-guided needle biopsy, bronchoscopic examination, or even wedge biopsy should be considered when clinical symptoms show deterioration despite adequate antibiotic therapy. Precise pathologic diagnosis and molecular characterization are recommended in all cases, following the World Health Organization (WHO) classification.

Adult male Wistar rats were intraperitoneally injected with one of three doses of paraoxon (0.3, 0.7, or 1 mg/kg) or corn oil (vehicle). After 14 or 28 days, expression of apoptosis-related proteins, including B-cell leukemia/lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2), Bcl-2 associated X protein (Bax), and caspase-3, as well as the number of neurons and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) positive cells in hippocampus were examined by western blot, cresyl blue staining, and immunohistochemistry, respectively. After 14 and 28 days, Bax and caspase-3 proteins were significantly increased in rats receiving 0.7 and 1 mg/kg of paraoxon. A significant decrease in Bcl-2 protein levels was also observed in 0.7 and 1 mg/kg groups after 14 days and in 1 mg/kg group after 28 days. Animals treated with 1 mg/kg of paraoxon showed a significant decrease in the number of neurons in the CA1 area. Also, those treated with 0.7 and 1 mg/kg of paraoxon showed an increase in the number of GFAP positive cells in both CA1 and CA3 areas as well as a significant decrease in survived neurons in the CA3 area. Our results indicated that neuronal damage induced by convulsive doses of paraoxon in rat hippocampus is mediated in part through apoptosis mechanism. Activation of astrocytes might lead to reduced extent of damage and damage and consequently increased neuronal survival.","['Zare, Zohreh', 'Zarbakhsh, Sam', 'Tehrani, Mohsen', 'Mohammadi, Moslem']","['Zare Z', 'Zarbakhsh S', 'Tehrani M', 'Mohammadi M']","['Department of Anatomical Sciences, Molecular and Cell Biology Research Center, School of Medicine, Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences, Sari, Iran.', 'Nervous System Stem Cells Research Center, Semnan University of Medical Sciences, Semnan, Iran.', 'Department of Immunology, Gastrointestinal Cancer Research Center, School of Medicine, Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences, Sari, Iran.', 'Department of Physiology, Molecular and Cell Biology Research Center, School of Medicine, Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences, Sari, Iran.

Recent advances in molecular and genomic profiling have provided unprecedented insight into disease pathogenesis driven by distinct cells of origins and molecular pathways. The discovery and clinical application of molecular biomarkers in PTCL subtypes has the potential to transform personalized care for patients with PTCL in diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy. Targeting CD30+ PTCL with the antibody-drug conjugate brentuximab vedotin in the relapsed setting and in combination with chemotherapy in the frontline setting has improved patient survivals. Epigenetic modifying agents, including HDAC inhibitors and hypomethylating agents, have demonstrated broad clinical efficacy and durability and are in clinical development for combination strategies for both relapsed and frontline settings. Wide-ranging novel agents targeting critical intracellular pathways and tumor microenvironment are in active exploration to define clinical activities. This review summarizes PTCL-specific biomarkers which are increasingly incorporated in clinical practice to guide precision diagnosis and personalized treatment.","['Mulvey, Erin', 'Ruan, Jia']","['Mulvey E', 'Ruan J']","['Meyer Cancer Center, Weill Cornell Medicine, 1305 York Avenue, 7th Floor, New York, NY, 10021, USA.', 'Meyer Cancer Center, Weill Cornell Medicine, 1305 York Avenue, 7th Floor, New York, NY, 10021, USA. jruan@med.cornell.edu.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200524,England,J Hematol Oncol,Journal of hematology & oncology,101468937,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Immunoconjugates)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Consolidation Chemotherapy', 'Disease Management', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Epigenesis, Genetic/drug effects', 'Forecasting', 'Humans', 'Immunoconjugates/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/drug therapy', 'Lymphoma, Extranodal NK-T-Cell/drug therapy', 'Lymphoma, Large-Cell, Anaplastic/drug therapy', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell, Peripheral/*drug therapy', 'Maintenance Chemotherapy', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy/*methods', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Precision Medicine/*methods/trends', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Therapies, Investigational/*methods', 'Tumor Microenvironment/drug effects']",PMC7245625,['NOTNLM'],"['*CD30-positive peripheral T cell lymphoma (PTCL)', '*Epigenetic targeting', '*HDAC inhibitors', '*Hypomethylating agents', '*Nodal PTCL with T follicular helper (TFH) phenotype', '*Tumor microenvironment']",2020/05/26 06:00,2021/05/18 06:00,['2020/05/26 06:00'],"['2020/03/12 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/05/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/18 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13045-020-00889-z [doi]', '10.1186/s13045-020-00889-z [pii]']",epublish,J Hematol Oncol. 2020 May 24;13(1):59. doi: 10.1186/s13045-020-00889-z.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, TLR4 was described as involved in natural programmed cell death (apoptosis). Tumor and embryonic cells are used as in vitro cellular models for drug and anti-cancer agent screening. To date, no cytotoxic studies have been reported of HM in TLR4-positive acute monocytic leukemia THP-1 cells compared to TLR4-negative human embryonic kidney HEK293 cells. METHODS: We studied the anti-proliferative effects of several HM concentrations on THP-1 and HEK293 cells by evaluating cell viability using the CellTiter-Glo(R) luminescent assay, assessing the TLR4 expression level, determining the apoptotic status, and analyzing the cell cycle distribution using flow cytometry. Apoptotic pathways were investigated using mitochondrial transition pore opening, caspase activity assays and immunoblot technology. RESULTS: Low HM concentrations did not affect THP-1 cell viability, but high HM concentrations (62.5-500 mug/mL) did decrease THP-1 cell viability and induced G0/G1 phase cell cycle arrest. Only at the highest concentration (500 mug/mL), HM slightly increased the TLR4 expression on the THP-1 cell surface, concomitantly upregulated TLR4 whole protein and gene expression, and induced apoptosis in THP-1 cells via activation of the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways. No change of apoptotic status was noticed in TLR4-negative HEK293 cells, although HM decreased HEK293 cell viability and induced cell growth arrest in the G2 phase. CONCLUSION: HM exerts distinct anti-proliferative effects on human acute monocytic leukemia and embryonic kidney cells mainly through cell cycle interference in a TLR4-independent manner and through apoptosis induction in a TLR4-dependent manner, as observed in only the THP-1 cells.","['El-Obeid, Adila', 'Alajmi, Hala', 'Harbi, Mashael', 'Yahya, Wesam Bin', 'Al-Eidi, Hamad', 'Alaujan, Monira', 'Haseeb, Adil', 'Trivilegio, Thadeo', 'Alhallaj, Alshaimaa', 'Alghamdi, Saleh', 'Ajlouni, Abdul-Wali', 'Matou-Nasri, Sabine']","['El-Obeid A', 'Alajmi H', 'Harbi M', 'Yahya WB', 'Al-Eidi H', 'Alaujan M', 'Haseeb A', 'Trivilegio T', 'Alhallaj A', 'Alghamdi S', 'Ajlouni AW', 'Matou-Nasri S']","['Cell and Gene Therapy Group, Medical Genomics Research Department, King Abdullah International Medical Research Center, Ministry of National Guard Health Affairs, P.O.

Methods: Semi-quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to detect the expression of CD19 mRNA isoforms before and after BiTE treatment in a patient with CD19(+) B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) . CD19 isoforms were analyzed by Sanger sequencing. Flow cytometry and transcriptome sequencing were performed to analyze the expression of cell lineage specific molecules before and after BiTE treatment. Results: The expression of CD19 isoform with exon 2 deletion was identified at diagnosis. After relapsed and treatment of BiTE antibody, the patient did not achieve remission and CD19 antigen on leukemic cells turned negative detected by flow cytometry after BiTE treatment. However the expression ratio of CD19 isoform with exon 2 deletion was not increased. Flow cytometry phenotype and transcriptome sequencing confirmed that no linage switching developed, which suggested the expression of CD19 isoform caused by exon alternative splicing and lineage switching was not related to CD19 epitope loss in this patient. This patient achieved complete remission by sequential administration of self-developed CD22 CAR-T and CD19 CAR-T after disease progression. Conclusion: Targeting or combining an alternative antigen specific CAR-T may be a promising treatment option after losing CD19 expression in relapsed ALL.","['Fu, X H', 'Wang, Y', 'Wang, H J', 'Wei, S N', 'Xu, Y X', 'Xing, H Y', 'Tang, K J', 'Tian, Z', 'Rao, Q', 'Wang, J X', 'Wang, M']","['Fu XH', 'Wang Y', 'Wang HJ', 'Wei SN', 'Xu YX', 'Xing HY', 'Tang KJ', 'Tian Z', 'Rao Q', 'Wang JX', 'Wang M']","['State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, CAMS & PUMC, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, CAMS & PUMC, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, CAMS & PUMC, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, CAMS & PUMC, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, CAMS & PUMC, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, CAMS & PUMC, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, CAMS & PUMC, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, CAMS & PUMC, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, CAMS & PUMC, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, CAMS & PUMC, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, CAMS & PUMC, Tianjin 300020, China.']",['chi'],"['2019YFA0110204/National Key R&D Program of China', '81830005/National Natural Science Foundation of China', '2016-I2M-1-007/CAMS Initiative Fund for Medical Sciences']","['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",,China,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua xue ye xue za zhi = Zhonghua xueyexue zazhi,8212398,"['0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Receptors, Chimeric Antigen)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD19', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Humans', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/therapy', 'Receptors, Chimeric Antigen', 'T-Lymphocytes']",PMC7364923,['NOTNLM'],"['Bispecific T-cell engagers', 'CD19', 'Epitope-loss', 'Isoform', 'Leukemia, lymphoblastic, acute']",2020/05/26 06:00,2020/07/30 06:00,['2020/05/26 06:00'],"['2020/05/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/05/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2020.04.004 [doi]'],ppublish,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2020 Apr 14;41(4):282-286. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2020.04.004.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Other manifestations include autoimmune disorders such as hemolytic anemia or thrombocytopenic purpura mediated by the immune system, increased susceptibility to malignant tumors, including lymphoma or leukemia. CLINICAL CASE: A 7-year-old male patient with a diagnosis of Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome who was treated with intravenous gamma globulin, antimicrobial prophylaxis with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and fluconazole, as well as with prednisone and cyclosporine due to hemolytic anemia and uveitis. Suddenly, he presented a deviation of the left labial commissure, so he was hospitalized. The studies showed a giant aneurysm of the aorta root, ascending aorta, descending aorta, and right coronary aorta, with insidious cardiac symptoms; therefore, he was referred to the vascular surgery department. CONCLUSION: Vasculitis in Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome is rare and it is usually asymptomatic in early stages, so an annual cardiovascular evaluation should be performed in order to avoid the complications of an aneurysm, which can be deleterious in this type of immunodeficiency where the possibility of death from bleeding is high.","['Garcia-Dominguez, Miguel', 'De la O-Espinoza, Estivaliz Arizel', 'Cruz-Munoz, Mario']","['Garcia-Dominguez M', 'De la O-Espinoza EA', 'Cruz-Munoz M']","['Hospital Pediatrico de Sinaloa, Departamento de Inmunologia y Alergia, Sinaloa, Mexico. miguelgarcia.alergia@gmail.com.']",['spa'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,Mexico,Rev Alerg Mex,"Revista alergia Mexico (Tecamachalco, Puebla, Mexico : 1993)",9438824,,IM,"['Aortic Aneurysm, Thoracic/diagnostic imaging/*etiology', 'Child', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome/*complications']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Aortic aneurysm', 'Autoimmune disorders', 'Immunodeficiency', 'Vasculitis', 'Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome']",2020/05/25 06:00,2021/06/02 06:00,['2020/05/25 06:00'],"['2020/05/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/05/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.29262/ram.v67i1.696 [doi]'],ppublish,Rev Alerg Mex. 2020 Jan-Mar;67(1):87-93. doi: 10.29262/ram.v67i1.696.,,,,,,,,,,,Aneurisma aortico en un paciente con sindrome de Wiskott-Aldrich.,,,,,,,,

Those affected are at high risk for severe organ toxicity and treatment delays that can impact outcomes. TRP is associated with asparaginase, a standard therapeutic agent in childhood ALL. Native American ancestry, older age, high-risk leukemia, and increased use of asparaginase are linked to pancreatitis risk. However, dedicated genetic studies evaluating pancreatitis in childhood ALL include few Hispanics. Thus, the genetic basis for higher risk of pancreatitis among Hispanic children with ALL remains unknown. METHODS: Cases of children with ALL treated in from 1994 through 2013 were reviewed and identified 14, all Hispanic, who developed pancreatitis related to asparaginase therapy. Forty-six controls consisting of Hispanic children treated on the same regimens without pancreatitis were selected for comparison. Total DNA isolated from whole blood was used for targeted DNA sequencing of 23 selected genes, including genes associated with pancreatitis without ALL and genes involved in asparagine metabolism. RESULTS: Non-synonymous polymorphisms and frameshift deletions were detected in 15 genes. Most children with TRP had variants in ABAT, ASNS, and CFTR. Notably, children with TRP harbored many more CFTR variants (71.4%) compared with controls (39.1%). Among these, V470M (rs213950) was most frequent (OR 4.27, p = 0.025). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study of genetic factors in treatment-related pancreatitis in Hispanic children with ALL. Identifying correlative variants in ethnically vulnerable populations may improve screening to identify which patients with ALL are at greatest risk for pancreatitis.","['Grimes, Allison C', 'Chen, Yidong', 'Bansal, Hima', 'Aguilar, Christine', 'Perez Prado, Luz', 'Quezada, Gerardo', 'Estrada, Jaime', 'Tomlinson, Gail E']","['Grimes AC', 'Chen Y', 'Bansal H', 'Aguilar C', 'Perez Prado L', 'Quezada G', 'Estrada J', 'Tomlinson GE']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Texas Health Science Center San Antonio, San Antonio, TX, USA.', ""Greehey Children's Cancer Research Institute, University of Texas Health Science Center San Antonio, San Antonio, TX, USA."", ""Greehey Children's Cancer Research Institute, University of Texas Health Science Center San Antonio, San Antonio, TX, USA."", 'Department of Population Health Sciences, University of Texas Health Science Center San Antonio, San Antonio, TX, USA.', ""Greehey Children's Cancer Research Institute, University of Texas Health Science Center San Antonio, San Antonio, TX, USA."", 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Texas Health Science Center San Antonio, San Antonio, TX, USA.', ""Greehey Children's Cancer Research Institute, University of Texas Health Science Center San Antonio, San Antonio, TX, USA."", ""Greehey Children's Cancer Research Institute, University of Texas Health Science Center San Antonio, San Antonio, TX, USA."", ""Methodist Children's Hospital, San Antonio, TX, USA."", ""Children's Hospital of San Antonio, San Antonio, TX, USA."", ""Methodist Children's Hospital, San Antonio, TX, USA."", 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Texas Health Science Center San Antonio, San Antonio, TX, USA. tomlinsong@uthscsa.edu.', ""Greehey Children's Cancer Research Institute, University of Texas Health Science Center San Antonio, San Antonio, TX, USA. tomlinsong@uthscsa.edu.""]",['eng'],"['5P30CA054174-21/GF/NIH HHS/United States', 'RP160732/Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas', 'N/A/St. Baldricks Foundation', 'N/A/Hyundai Hope On Wheels', 'P30 CA054174/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'RP101491/Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas', 'N/A/UT Health Mays Cancer Center']",['Journal Article'],20200524,Germany,Support Care Cancer,Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer,9302957,"['0 (CFTR protein, human)', '0 (Genetic Markers)', '126880-72-6 (Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'EC 6.3.5.- (Carbon-Nitrogen Ligases with Glutamine as Amide-N-Donor)', 'EC 6.3.5.4 (ASNS protein, human)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Asparaginase/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Carbon-Nitrogen Ligases with Glutamine as Amide-N-Donor/genetics', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator/genetics', 'Female', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Hispanic or Latino/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Pancreatitis/*chemically induced/*genetics/therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/*genetics']",PMC8098858,['NOTNLM'],"['Adverse effect', 'Genetic variant', 'Leukemia', 'Pancreatitis', 'Pediatric cancer']",2020/05/25 06:00,2021/02/20 06:00,['2020/05/25 06:00'],"['2019/11/12 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/02/01 00:00 [pmc-release]', '2020/05/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/20 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/25 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00520-020-05530-w [doi]', '10.1007/s00520-020-05530-w [pii]']",ppublish,Support Care Cancer. 2021 Feb;29(2):725-731. doi: 10.1007/s00520-020-05530-w.

After the emergence of tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), most patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph-positive ALL) now achieve negative results for minimal residual disease (MRD) at HCT. In this study, we evaluated patients aged 50 years or more with Ph-positive ALL who received TKI before HCT, achieved negative-MRD at HCT, and underwent their first allogeneic HCT between 2008 and 2017. In total, 90 and 136 patients who received myeloablative conditioning (MAC) and a RIC regimen, respectively, were included. The median age of patients with MAC and RIC was 54 and 60 years, respectively. Even in multivariate analyses, RIC was not significantly associated with overall mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 1.09; P = 0.724), hematological relapse (HR, 1.97; P = 0.170), or non-relapse mortality (HR, 0.84; P = 0.540). Subgroup analyses suggested that RIC resulted in superior overall survival due to a lower incidence of non-relapse mortality in patients with a poor performance status or a high HCT comorbidity index.

Consequently, the mechanisms leading to this resistance must be understood and addressed. In this paper, we demonstrate that inhibition of deubiquitinylase USP7 significantly reduces cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo, blocks DNA replication progression and increases cell death in AML. Transcriptomic dataset analyses reveal that a USP7 gene signature is highly enriched in cells from AML patients at relapse, as well as in residual blasts from patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models treated with clinically relevant doses of cytarabine, which indicates a relationship between USP7 expression and resistance to therapy. Accordingly, single-cell analysis of AML patient samples at relapse versus at diagnosis showed that a gene signature of the pre-existing subpopulation responsible for relapse is enriched in transcriptomes of patients with a high USP7 level. Furthermore, we found that USP7 interacts and modulates CHK1 protein levels and functions in AML. Finally, we demonstrated that USP7 inhibition acts in synergy with cytarabine to kill AML cell lines and primary cells of patients with high USP7 levels. Altogether, these data demonstrate that USP7 is both a marker of resistance to chemotherapy and a potential therapeutic target in overcoming resistance to treatment.","['Cartel, Maelle', 'Mouchel, Pierre-Luc', 'Gotanegre, Mathilde', 'David, Laure', 'Bertoli, Sarah', 'Mansat-De Mas, Veronique', 'Besson, Arnaud', 'Sarry, Jean-Emmanuel', 'Manenti, Stephane', 'Didier, Christine']","['Cartel M', 'Mouchel PL', 'Gotanegre M', 'David L', 'Bertoli S', 'Mansat-De Mas V', 'Besson A', 'Sarry JE', 'Manenti S', 'Didier C']","['Cancer Research Center of Toulouse, INSERM U1037, CNRS ERL 5294, Universite de Toulouse, Toulouse, France.', 'Ligue Nationale Contre le Cancer, equipe labellisee 2016, Toulouse, France.', 'Cancer Research Center of Toulouse, INSERM U1037, CNRS ERL 5294, Universite de Toulouse, Toulouse, France.', 'Ligue Nationale Contre le Cancer, equipe labellisee 2018, Toulouse, France.', ""Service d'hematologie, Institut Universitaire du Cancer de Toulouse-Oncopole, Toulouse, France."", 'Cancer Research Center of Toulouse, INSERM U1037, CNRS ERL 5294, Universite de Toulouse, Toulouse, France.', 'Ligue Nationale Contre le Cancer, equipe labellisee 2018, Toulouse, France.', 'Cancer Research Center of Toulouse, INSERM U1037, CNRS ERL 5294, Universite de Toulouse, Toulouse, France.', 'Ligue Nationale Contre le Cancer, equipe labellisee 2016, Toulouse, France.', 'IRSD, Universite de Toulouse, INSERM, INRA, ENVT, UPS, Toulouse, France.', 'Cancer Research Center of Toulouse, INSERM U1037, CNRS ERL 5294, Universite de Toulouse, Toulouse, France.', 'Ligue Nationale Contre le Cancer, equipe labellisee 2016, Toulouse, France.', ""Service d'hematologie, Institut Universitaire du Cancer de Toulouse-Oncopole, Toulouse, France."", 'Cancer Research Center of Toulouse, INSERM U1037, CNRS ERL 5294, Universite de Toulouse, Toulouse, France.', 'Ligue Nationale Contre le Cancer, equipe labellisee 2016, Toulouse, France.', ""Laboratoire d'hematologie, Institut Universitaire du Cancer de Toulouse-Oncopole, Toulouse, France."", 'LBCMCP, Centre de Biologie Integrative, Universite de Toulouse, CNRS, UPS, 31062, Toulouse Cedex, France.', 'Cancer Research Center of Toulouse, INSERM U1037, CNRS ERL 5294, Universite de Toulouse, Toulouse, France.', 'Ligue Nationale Contre le Cancer, equipe labellisee 2018, Toulouse, France.', 'Cancer Research Center of Toulouse, INSERM U1037, CNRS ERL 5294, Universite de Toulouse, Toulouse, France.', 'Ligue Nationale Contre le Cancer, equipe labellisee 2016, Toulouse, France.', 'Cancer Research Center of Toulouse, INSERM U1037, CNRS ERL 5294, Universite de Toulouse, Toulouse, France. christine.didier@inserm.fr.', 'Ligue Nationale Contre le Cancer, equipe labellisee 2016, Toulouse, France. christine.didier@inserm.fr.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200523,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'EC 3.4.19.12 (USP7 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.19.12 (Ubiquitin-Specific Peptidase 7)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cytarabine/*pharmacology', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Signal Transduction', 'Survival Rate', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Ubiquitin-Specific Peptidase 7/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",PMC7245510,,,2020/05/25 06:00,2021/02/26 06:00,['2020/05/25 06:00'],"['2019/10/11 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/13 00:00 [revised]', '2020/05/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/26 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/25 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-020-0878-x [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-020-0878-x [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2021 Feb;35(2):417-432. doi: 10.1038/s41375-020-0878-x.

However, many patients suffer from limited response and tumor relapse due to lack of persisting CAR T cells and immune escape. These clinical challenges have compromised the long-term efficacy of CAR T-cell therapy and call for the development of novel CAR designs. We demonstrated that CAR T cells secreting a cytokine interleukin-36gamma (IL-36gamma) showed significantly improved CAR T-cell expansion and persistence, and resulted in superior tumor eradication compared with conventional CAR T cells. The enhanced cellular function by IL-36gamma was mediated through an autocrine manner. In addition, activation of endogenous antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and T cells by IL-36gamma aided the formation of a secondary antitumor response, which delayed the progression of antigen-negative tumor challenge. Together, our data provide preclinical evidence to support the translation of this design for an improved CAR T-cell-mediated antitumor response.","['Li, Xinghuo', 'Daniyan, Anthony F', 'Lopez, Andrea V', 'Purdon, Terence J', 'Brentjens, Renier J']","['Li X', 'Daniyan AF', 'Lopez AV', 'Purdon TJ', 'Brentjens RJ']","['Weill Cornell Graduate School of Medical Sciences, New York, NY, 10065, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Sloan Kettering Institute, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, 10065, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Sloan Kettering Institute, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, 10065, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Sloan Kettering Institute, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, 10065, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Sloan Kettering Institute, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, 10065, USA.', 'Weill Cornell Graduate School of Medical Sciences, New York, NY, 10065, USA. brentjer@mskcc.org.', 'Department of Medicine, Sloan Kettering Institute, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, 10065, USA. brentjer@mskcc.org.', 'Molecular Pharmacology & Chemistry Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, 10065, USA. brentjer@mskcc.org.', 'Center for Cell Engineering, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, 10065, USA. brentjer@mskcc.org.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, 10065, USA. brentjer@mskcc.org.']",['eng'],"['P50 CA192937/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5 P01 CA190174-03/U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services | National', 'Institutes of Health (NIH)', 'K12 CA184746/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5 P50 CA192937-02/U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services | National', 'Institutes of Health (NIH)', 'P01 CA190174/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200523,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (IL36G protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Myd88 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Differentiation Factor 88)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Chimeric Antigen)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigen-Presenting Cells', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Cellular/*immunology', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/*methods', 'Interleukin-1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Lymphocyte Activation/*immunology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/*immunology/metabolism/pathology/therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, SCID', 'Myeloid Differentiation Factor 88/physiology', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*immunology', 'Receptors, Chimeric Antigen/*immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",PMC7680719,,,2020/05/25 06:00,2021/02/26 06:00,['2020/05/25 06:00'],"['2020/01/30 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/04/28 00:00 [revised]', '2020/05/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/26 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/25 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-020-0874-1 [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-020-0874-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2021 Feb;35(2):506-521. doi: 10.1038/s41375-020-0874-1.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the association between parental age at conception and the risk of AL in Mexican children, a population with a high incidence of the disease and a high prevalence of pregnancies in adolescents and young adults. METHODS: A multicentre case-control study was conducted. Incident AL cases younger than 17 years of age diagnosed between 2010 and 2015 were included. Controls were matched with cases according to age, sex, and health institution. Using logistic regression analysis, adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CI) were calculated for each maternal stratum after adjusting for paternal age at conception of index child. The maternal age between 25 and 29.99 years was selected as the reference category. RESULTS: In most strata where maternal and paternal ages were assessed, no association was found with the risk of developing acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) and acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) in their offspring. An increased risk for AML was observed when the mother was between 20 and 24.99 years of age and the father aged 25-29.99 years (aOR, 1.94; 95 % CI, 1.03-3.67). In addition, there was a positive association for ALL when the mother s age was between 20 and 24.99 years and the father was <20 years of age, however, a very wide confidence interval was noted (aOR, 12.26; 95 % CI, 1.41-106.83). CONCLUSION: In the present study, maternal and paternal ages assessed in different strata showed little association with risk of developing ALL and AML in children. Positive associations between risk of both types of childhood AL were observed with younger paternal and maternal ages.","['Jimenez-Hernandez, Elva', 'Duarte-Rodriguez, David Aldebaran', 'Nunez-Enriquez, Juan Carlos', 'Flores-Lujano, Janet', 'Martin-Trejo, Jorge Alfonso', 'Espinoza-Hernandez, Laura Eugenia', 'Arellano-Galindo, Jose', 'Medina-Sanson, Aurora', 'Garcia-Jimenez, Xochiketzalli', 'Paredes-Aguilera, Rogelio', 'Flores-Villegas, Luz Victoria', 'Penaloza-Gonzalez, Jose Gabriel', 'Torres-Nava, Jose Refugio', 'Espinosa-Elizondo, Rosa Martha', 'Amador-Sanchez, Raquel', 'Dosta-Herrera, Juan Jose', 'Mondragon-Garcia, Javier Anastacio', 'Valdes-Guzman, Heriberto', 'Mejia-Perez, Laura', 'Espinoza-Anrubio, Gilberto', 'Paz-Bribiesca, Maria Minerva', 'Salcedo-Lozada, Perla', 'Landa-Garcia, Rodolfo Angel', 'Ramirez-Colorado, Rosario', 'Hernandez-Mora, Luis', 'Perez-Saldivar, Maria Luisa', 'Santamaria-Ascencio, Marlene', 'Lopez-Loyola, Anselmo', 'Godoy-Esquivel, Arturo Hermilo', 'Garcia-Lopez, Luis Ramiro', 'Anguiano-Avalos, Alison Ireri', 'Mora-Rico, Karina', 'Castaneda-Echevarria, Alejandro', 'Rodriguez-Jimenez, Roberto', 'Cibrian-Cruz, Jose Alberto', 'Cardenas-Cardos, Rocio', 'Altamirano-Garcia, Martha Beatriz', 'Sanchez-Ruiz, Martin', 'Rivera-Luna, Roberto', 'Rodriguez-Villalobos, Luis Rodolfo', 'Hernandez-Perez, Francisco', 'Olvera-Duran, Jaime Angel', 'Garcia-Cortes, Luis Rey', 'Mata-Rocha, Minerva', 'Sepulveda-Robles, Omar Alejandro', 'Bekker-Mendez, Vilma Carolina', 'Jimenez-Morales, Silvia', 'Rosas-Vargas, Haydee', 'Mejia-Arangure, Juan Manuel']","['Jimenez-Hernandez E', 'Duarte-Rodriguez DA', 'Nunez-Enriquez JC', 'Flores-Lujano J', 'Martin-Trejo JA', 'Espinoza-Hernandez LE', 'Arellano-Galindo J', 'Medina-Sanson A', 'Garcia-Jimenez X', 'Paredes-Aguilera R', 'Flores-Villegas LV', 'Penaloza-Gonzalez JG', 'Torres-Nava JR', 'Espinosa-Elizondo RM', 'Amador-Sanchez R', 'Dosta-Herrera JJ', 'Mondragon-Garcia JA', 'Valdes-Guzman H', 'Mejia-Perez L', 'Espinoza-Anrubio G', 'Paz-Bribiesca MM', 'Salcedo-Lozada P', 'Landa-Garcia RA', 'Ramirez-Colorado R', 'Hernandez-Mora L', 'Perez-Saldivar ML', 'Santamaria-Ascencio M', 'Lopez-Loyola A', 'Godoy-Esquivel AH', 'Garcia-Lopez LR', 'Anguiano-Avalos AI', 'Mora-Rico K', 'Castaneda-Echevarria A', 'Rodriguez-Jimenez R', 'Cibrian-Cruz JA', 'Cardenas-Cardos R', 'Altamirano-Garcia MB', 'Sanchez-Ruiz M', 'Rivera-Luna R', 'Rodriguez-Villalobos LR', 'Hernandez-Perez F', 'Olvera-Duran JA', 'Garcia-Cortes LR', 'Mata-Rocha M', 'Sepulveda-Robles OA', 'Bekker-Mendez VC', 'Jimenez-Morales S', 'Rosas-Vargas H', 'Mejia-Arangure JM']","['Coordinacion de Investigacion en Salud, CMN ""Siglo XXI"", IMSS.

However, most of the reported CDK9 inhibitors are still at an early stage of development and lack selectivity against other CDKs. Herein, we discovered coumarin derivative 30i as a potent CDK9 inhibitor with high selectivity (8300-fold over CDK7). Binding mode analysis illustrated that the substituent coumarin moiety is a critical group for CDK9 selectivity by occupying a flexible hinge/alphaD region, which is sterically hindered in other CDKs. Compound 30i showed excellent cellular antiproliferative activity, moderate pharmacokinetic property and low hERG inhibition. Moreover, 30i significantly induced tumour growth inhibition in a dose-dependent manner without causing an obvious loss of body weight in an MV4-11 xenograft mice model. Altogether, these results suggest that 30i may serve as a potential acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) therapeutics by selectively targeting CDK9.","['Xu, Junyu', 'Li, Hongmei', 'Wang, Xinren', 'Huang, Jianhang', 'Li, Shuwen', 'Liu, Chenhe', 'Dong, Ruinan', 'Zhu, Gaoyuan', 'Duan, Chunqi', 'Jiang, Fei', 'Zhang, Yanmin', 'Zhu, Yuqin', 'Zhang, Tianyi', 'Chen, Yadong', 'Tang, Weifang', 'Lu, Tao']","['Xu J', 'Li H', 'Wang X', 'Huang J', 'Li S', 'Liu C', 'Dong R', 'Zhu G', 'Duan C', 'Jiang F', 'Zhang Y', 'Zhu Y', 'Zhang T', 'Chen Y', 'Tang W', 'Lu T']","['School of Sciences, China Pharmaceutical University, 639 Longmian Avenue, Nanjing, 211198, China; Hainan province Key Laboratory for Research and Development of Tropical Herbs, Hainan Medical University, Haikou, 571199, China.', 'School of Sciences, China Pharmaceutical University, 639 Longmian Avenue, Nanjing, 211198, China.', 'School of Sciences, China Pharmaceutical University, 639 Longmian Avenue, Nanjing, 211198, China.', 'School of Sciences, China Pharmaceutical University, 639 Longmian Avenue, Nanjing, 211198, China.', 'School of Sciences, China Pharmaceutical University, 639 Longmian Avenue, Nanjing, 211198, China.', 'School of Sciences, China Pharmaceutical University, 639 Longmian Avenue, Nanjing, 211198, China.', 'School of Sciences, China Pharmaceutical University, 639 Longmian Avenue, Nanjing, 211198, China.', 'School of Sciences, China Pharmaceutical University, 639 Longmian Avenue, Nanjing, 211198, China.', 'School of Sciences, China Pharmaceutical University, 639 Longmian Avenue, Nanjing, 211198, China.', 'School of Sciences, China Pharmaceutical University, 639 Longmian Avenue, Nanjing, 211198, China.', 'School of Sciences, China Pharmaceutical University, 639 Longmian Avenue, Nanjing, 211198, China; Laboratory of Molecular Design and Drug Discovery, School of Science, China Pharmaceutical University, 639 Longmian Avenue, Nanjing, 211198, China.', 'School of Sciences, China Pharmaceutical University, 639 Longmian Avenue, Nanjing, 211198, China.', 'School of Sciences, China Pharmaceutical University, 639 Longmian Avenue, Nanjing, 211198, China.', 'School of Sciences, China Pharmaceutical University, 639 Longmian Avenue, Nanjing, 211198, China; State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, China Pharmaceutical University, 24 Tongjiaxiang, Nanjing, 210009, China; Laboratory of Molecular Design and Drug Discovery, School of Science, China Pharmaceutical University, 639 Longmian Avenue, Nanjing, 211198, China.

An increased understanding of the mechanism underlying ABT-263-induced MCL1 expression may provide a strategy to improve its tumor-suppression activity. The present study revealed that ABT-263 reduced the turnover of MCL1 mRNA, thereby upregulating MCL1 expression in human K562 leukemia cells. Furthermore, ABT-263-induced EGFR activation promoted AGO2 phosphorylation at Y393 and reduced miR-125b maturation. Treatment with EGFR inhibitors mitigated MCL1 upregulation induced by ABT-263. Additionally, lithium chloride (LiCl) alleviated ABT-263-induced MCL1 upregulation through EGFR-AGO2 axis-modulated miR-125b suppression. Ectopic expression of dominant negative AGO2(Y393F) or transfection with miR-125b abolished ABT-263-induced upregulation of MCL1 mRNA and protein levels. Co-treatment with either EGFR inhibitors or LiCl collaboratively enhanced ABT-263 cytotoxicity, while MCL1 overexpression eliminated this synergistic effect. Collectively, our data reveal that ABT-263 increases EGFR-mediated AGO2 phosphorylation, which in turn suppresses miR-125b-mediated MCL1 mRNA degradation in K562 cells. The suppression of this signaling pathway results in the synergistic cytotoxic effect of EGFR inhibitors or LiCl and ABT-263.","['Lee, Yuan-Chin', 'Wang, Liang-Jun', 'Huang, Chia-Hui', 'Chiou, Jing-Ting', 'Shi, Yi-Jun', 'Chang, Long-Sen']","['Lee YC', 'Wang LJ', 'Huang CH', 'Chiou JT', 'Shi YJ', 'Chang LS']","['Institute of Biomedical Sciences, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung 804, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Biomedical Sciences, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung 804, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Biomedical Sciences, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung 804, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Biomedical Sciences, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung 804, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Biomedical Sciences, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung 804, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Biomedical Sciences, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung 804, Taiwan; Department of Biotechnology, Kaohsiung Medical University, Kaohsiung 807, Taiwan.

This mainly occur in children who have ingested sewing machine oil or other mineral oils accidentally. Despite emerging evidences revealing that inhibiting inflammation improves acute exogenous lipoid pneumonia, the actual process of inhibiting inflammation remains unknown. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of PDTC and dexamethasone on AELP to gain insight into the mechanism of AELP. METHODS: The experimental rats were randomly divided into 10 groups: NS control group (NS3 group, NS5 group), Oil inhalation group (AE3 group, AE5 group), PDTC intervention group (PDTC3 group, PDTC5 group), DXM intervention group (DXM3 group, DXM5 group), PDTC + DXM combined intervention group (PDTC + DXM3 group, PDTC + DXM 5 group). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to determine concentrations of macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha) in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and serum samples. On the other hand, western blotting was used to measure the expression levels of nuclear factor-kappaB p65 (NF-kappaB p65) and b-cell leukemia 2 (Bcl-2) in the lungs. Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) staining was performed to evaluate changes in the lung tissue. The wet-to-dry lung weight ratio was subsequently used to determine the pulmonary edema of the lungs. RESULTS: There were increased MIF levels in both serum and BALF samples of the AE group. Pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC) and dexamethasone (DXM) independently and in combination reduced pulmonary inflammation induced by the sewing machine oil by regulating MIF expression. TNF-alpha and IL-6 levels in serum and BALF samples of the AE group were higher than those of the NS control animals. However, their levels decreased after treatment with either PDTC, DXM or PDTC + DXM. Similarly, NF-kappaBp65 expression increased after oil inhalation but decreased after treatment with either PDTC, DXM or PDTC + DXM. PDTC, DXM and PDTC + DXM treatment significantly reduced pulmonary inflammation and pulmonary edema of the lung tissue following induction of acute exogenous lipoid pneumonia. CONCLUSIONS: Individual or combined use of PDTC and DXM can ameliorate pulmonary inflammation induced by inhalation of sewing machine oil by inhibiting the NF-kappaB pathway in young rats. These findings provide novel insights that will greatly contribute in treatment of AELP.","['Liang, Dong-Shi', 'Huang, Ai-Rong', 'Lin, Miao-Miao', 'Xia, Xiao-Jiao', 'Jin, Yi-Mei']","['Liang DS', 'Huang AR', 'Lin MM', 'Xia XJ', 'Jin YM']","[""Department of Pediatrics, Second Affiliated Hospital &Yuying Children's Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou 325027, China."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Second Affiliated Hospital &Yuying Children's Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou 325027, China."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Second Affiliated Hospital &Yuying Children's Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou 325027, China."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Second Affiliated Hospital &Yuying Children's Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou 325027, China."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Second Affiliated Hospital &Yuying Children's Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou 325027, China.

In-vitro screening of different HDACs isoforms revealed that P19 was the most potent and selective inhibitor for HDAC8 (IC50 - 9.3 muM). Thermal shift analysis (TSA) confirmed the binding of P19 to HDAC8. In-vitro screening of all compounds on the transport activity of GLUT1, GLUT4, and GLUT5 indicated that P19 inhibited GLUT1 (IC50 - 28.2 muM). P10 and P19 induced apoptotic cell death in CEM cells (55.19% and 60.97% respectively) and P19 was less cytotoxic on normal WBCs (CC50 - 104.2 muM) and human fibroblasts (HS27) (CC50 - 105.0 muM). Thus, among this novel series of TZD derivatives, compound P19 was most promising HDAC8 inhibitor and cytotoxic on leukemic cells. Thus, P19 could serve as a lead for further development of optimized molecules with enhanced selectivity and potency.","['Upadhyay, Neha', 'Tilekar, Kalpana', 'Jansch, Niklas', 'Schweipert, Markus', 'Hess, Jessica D', 'Henze Macias, Luca', 'Mrowka, Piotr', 'Aguilera, Renato J', 'Choe, Jun-Yong', 'Meyer-Almes, Franz-Josef', 'Ramaa, C S']","['Upadhyay N', 'Tilekar K', 'Jansch N', 'Schweipert M', 'Hess JD', 'Henze Macias L', 'Mrowka P', 'Aguilera RJ', 'Choe JY', 'Meyer-Almes FJ', 'Ramaa CS']","[""Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Bharati Vidyapeeth's College of Pharmacy, Navi Mumbai, India."", ""Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Bharati Vidyapeeth's College of Pharmacy, Navi Mumbai, India."", 'Department of Chemical Engineering and Biotechnology, University of Applied Science, Darmstadt, Germany.', 'Department of Chemical Engineering and Biotechnology, University of Applied Science, Darmstadt, Germany.', 'The Cellular Characterization and Biorepository Core Facility & Border Biomedical Research Centre & Department of Biological Sciences, The University of Texas at El Paso, El Paso, TX, USA.', 'The Cellular Characterization and Biorepository Core Facility & Border Biomedical Research Centre & Department of Biological Sciences, The University of Texas at El Paso, El Paso, TX, USA.', 'Department of Biophysics and Human Physiology, Medical University of Warsaw, Chalubinskiego, Warsaw, Poland; Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, Indira Gandhi St., Warsaw, Poland.', 'The Cellular Characterization and Biorepository Core Facility & Border Biomedical Research Centre & Department of Biological Sciences, The University of Texas at El Paso, El Paso, TX, USA.', 'East Carolina Diabetes and Obesity Institute, East Carolina University, Greenville, NC 27834, USA; Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, The Chicago Medical School, Rosalind Franklin University of Medicine and Science, North Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Department of Chemical Engineering and Biotechnology, University of Applied Science, Darmstadt, Germany.

Our ability to identify patients at greatest risk of hemorrhage, and to actively prevent hemorrhage, remains limited. Nevertheless, some data is available to guide contemporary clinical practice and future investigation. Circulating disease burden, best represented by the peripheral WBC / blast count, is the most consistent predictor of major and fatal bleeding risk. In contrast, laboratory markers of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) appear to be poor predictors. A number of interventions have been posited to reduce bleeding risk. Prompt initiation of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), avoidance of invasive procedures, transfusion support, and cytoreduction all have theoretical merit. Though they lack strong evidence to support their benefit with respect to bleeding, they are associated with limited risks, and are therefore advisable. Low-dose therapeutic heparin and antifibrinolytics have not shown the ability to positively modify bleeding risk, and heparin has been associated with harm. Thrombomodulin has shown promise in limited retrospective studies however further prospective data are needed. rFVIIa may have a role in cases of life-threatening bleeding however evidence is largely anecdotal. Additional studies evaluating the above interventions, and investigating other potential interventions are needed.","['Naymagon, Leonard', 'Mascarenhas, John']","['Naymagon L', 'Mascarenhas J']","['Tisch Cancer Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, United States.

Since then, ship modernizations have decreased occupational exposure to gases, including the carcinogen benzene. We explored the risk of HMs in Swedish seafarers who had worked on newer types of tankers. METHODS: A case-referent study in male seafarers from a cohort of all Swedish seafarers was set up by record linkage with the Swedish Cancer Registry using the subjects' personal identification number. For each case (N = 315), five referents were randomly chosen from within the cohort, matched by birth year and three different periods of first sea service (<1985, 1985-1991, and >/=1992). Information on the type of ship and dates of service was retrieved from the Swedish Seafarers' Registry. Odds ratios (OR) were calculated by conditional logistic regression together with 95% confidence intervals (CI). RESULTS: The OR of HM was 1.07 (95% CI, 0.80-1.42) for work on tankers. In seafarers that had started to work on tankers >/=1985, the OR was 0.85 (95% CI, 0.50-1.43). For those who started to work on tankers before 1985, the OR was 1.17 (95% CI, 0.84-1.21) and 1.32 (95% CI, 0.86-2.03) if the cumulative time on tankers exceeded 5 years of service. In this last group, the OR of multiple myeloma was 5.39 (95% CI, 1.11-26.1). CONCLUSION: Although limited by crude exposure contrast and a short follow-up, work on tankers after 1985 was not associated with an increased risk of HM among Swedish seafarers.","['Forsell, Karl', 'Bjor, Ove', 'Jarvholm, Bengt', 'Nilsson, Ralph', 'Andersson, Eva']","['Forsell K', 'Bjor O', 'Jarvholm B', 'Nilsson R', 'Andersson E']","['Department of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, Sahlgrenska Academy, Gothenburg University, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Department of Radiation Science, Oncology, Umea University, Umea, Sweden.', 'Department of Public Health and Clinical Medicine, Umea University, Umea, Sweden.', 'Department of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, Sahlgrenska Academy, Gothenburg University, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Department of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, Sahlgrenska Academy, Gothenburg University, Gothenburg, Sweden.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200523,United States,Am J Ind Med,American journal of industrial medicine,8101110,,IM,"['Adult', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Motor Vehicles', 'Naval Medicine/*statistics & numerical data', 'Occupational Diseases/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Occupational Exposure/adverse effects/*statistics & numerical data', 'Odds Ratio', 'Oil and Gas Industry/*statistics & numerical data', 'Registries', 'Ships', 'Sweden/epidemiology', 'Time Factors']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*benzene', '*leukemia', '*lymphoma', '*multiple myeloma', '*tanker']",2020/05/24 06:00,2021/07/07 06:00,['2020/05/24 06:00'],"['2019/06/19 00:00 [received]', '2020/04/30 00:00 [revised]', '2020/05/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/07 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/24 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajim.23122 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Ind Med. 2020 Aug;63(8):685-692. doi: 10.1002/ajim.23122.

Advances in multi-agent chemotherapy have resulted in dramatic improvements in the number of pediatric cases that result in a cure; however, until recently, treatment options for older adults or patients with relapsed and refractory disease were extremely limited. This review seeks to describe in greater detail a number of emerging novel treatment modalities recently approved for this cancer. RECENT FINDINGS: In this review, we discuss a number of recently approved novel therapies for ALL, including new approaches with targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors, novel immune-based therapies including the bispecific antibody blinatumomab and the antibody-drug conjugate inotuzumab ozogamicin, and the role of cellular therapeutics such as chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells. We also discuss the impact that advances in diagnostics and disease classification and monitoring have had on treatment. A number of advances in ALL have resulted in dramatic changes to the treatment landscape and therapeutic options both at the time of diagnosis and in salvage. These findings are reshaping our treatment paradigms throughout the course of disease.","['Gavralidis, Alexander', 'Brunner, Andrew M']","['Gavralidis A', 'Brunner AM']","['North Shore Medical Center, Salem, MA, USA.', 'Massachusetts General Hospital, Zero Emerson Place Suite 118, Boston, MA, 02114, USA. abrunner@mgh.harvard.edu.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Curr Hematol Malig Rep,Current hematologic malignancy reports,101262565,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological)', '0 (Receptors, Chimeric Antigen)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', '*Immunotherapy, Adoptive/adverse effects', '*Molecular Targeted Therapy/adverse effects/mortality', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/immunology/mortality/*therapy', 'Receptors, Chimeric Antigen/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/*transplantation', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase', '*Blinatumomab', '*CAR T cell therapy', '*Inotuzumab ozogamicin', '*Measurable residual disease']",2020/05/24 06:00,2020/12/22 06:00,['2020/05/24 06:00'],"['2020/05/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/22 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/24 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s11899-020-00591-4 [doi]', '10.1007/s11899-020-00591-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Hematol Malig Rep. 2020 Aug;15(4):294-304. doi: 10.1007/s11899-020-00591-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of this study was to investigate factors affecting high-grade (grade III-IV) hepatotoxicity of TKIs. METHODS: This multi-center, retrospective study used individual patient data from five studies that examined factors affecting hepatotoxicity by TKIs (crizotinib, erlotinib, gefitinib, imatinib, and lapatinib). Odds ratio (OR) and adjusted OR (AOR) were estimated from univariate and multivariate analyses, respectively. RESULTS: Data from 1279 patients treated with TKIs were analyzed. The rate of patients who experienced high-grade hepatotoxicity after TKI administration was 5.5%. In multivariable analysis, H2 blockers and CYP3A4 inducers increased high-grade hepatotoxicity 2.2- (95% CI 1.255-3.944) and 3.3-fold (95% CI 1.260-8.698), respectively. Patients with liver metastasis revealed a 3.4-fold (95% CI 1.561-7.466) higher risk of high-grade hepatotoxicity. Among underlying malignancies, pancreatic cancer and other cancers including acute lymphoblastic leukemia increased the risk of high-grade hepatotoxicity by 2.6- and 24.3-fold, respectively, whereas breast cancer decreased the risk (AOR 0.3, 95% CI 0.106-0.852), compared to non-small cell lung cancer. In patients who administrated TKIs which form reactive metabolites, use of CYP3A4 inducers and liver metastasis increased incidence of high-grade hepatotoxicity by 3.0- and 2.3-fold, respectively. In patients with EGFR mutation, exon 19 deletion and use of proton pump inhibitors were risk factors for high-grade hepatotoxicity in addition to liver metastasis and use of H2 blockers. CONCLUSION: The use of H2 blockers, presence of liver metastasis, and CYP3A4 inducers were associated with high-grade hepatotoxicity of TKIs. In subgroup analyses, presence of exon 19 deletion, and/or proton pump inhibitors, was additional risk factors for high-grade hepatotoxicity in special patients and use of specific TKIs. Close liver function monitoring is recommended, especially in patients with liver metastasis or using H2 blockers or CYP3A4 inducers.","['Han, Ji Min', 'Han, Hye Won', 'Yee, Jeong', 'Kim, Min Kyoung', 'Moon, Jin Young', 'Cho, Soyeon', 'Jung, Dasom', 'Cho, Yoon Sook', 'Seo, Inyoung', 'Kim, Jae Youn', 'Gwak, Hye Sun']","['Han JM', 'Han HW', 'Yee J', 'Kim MK', 'Moon JY', 'Cho S', 'Jung D', 'Cho YS', 'Seo I', 'Kim JY', 'Gwak HS']","['College of Pharmacy and Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Ewha Womans University, Seoul, 03760, South Korea.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, 03080, South Korea.', 'College of Pharmacy and Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Ewha Womans University, Seoul, 03760, South Korea.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Asan Medical Center, Seoul, 05505, South Korea.', 'College of Pharmacy and Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Ewha Womans University, Seoul, 03760, South Korea.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, 03080, South Korea.', 'Graduate School of Converging Clinical & Public Health, Ewha Womans University, Seoul, 03760, South Korea.', 'College of Pharmacy and Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Ewha Womans University, Seoul, 03760, South Korea.', 'Department of Pharmacy, National Cancer Center, Goyang-si, 10408, South Korea.', 'College of Pharmacy and Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Ewha Womans University, Seoul, 03760, South Korea.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Asan Medical Center, Seoul, 05505, South Korea.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Asan Medical Center, Seoul, 05505, South Korea.', 'Graduate School of Converging Clinical & Public Health, Ewha Womans University, Seoul, 03760, South Korea.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, 03080, South Korea.', 'Department of Pharmacy, National Cancer Center, Goyang-si, 10408, South Korea.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Asan Medical Center, Seoul, 05505, South Korea.', 'College of Pharmacy and Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Ewha Womans University, Seoul, 03760, South Korea. hsgwak@ewha.ac.kr.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Observational Study']",20200522,Germany,Eur J Clin Pharmacol,European journal of clinical pharmacology,1256165,"['0 (Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Inducers)', '0 (Histamine H2 Antagonists)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proton Pump Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (EGFR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ErbB Receptors)']",IM,"['Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury/*epidemiology', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Inducers/adverse effects', 'ErbB Receptors/genetics', 'Female', 'Histamine H2 Antagonists/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/epidemiology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*adverse effects', 'Proton Pump Inhibitors/adverse effects', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors']",,['NOTNLM'],"['CYP3A4 inducers', 'Exon 19 deletion', 'H2 blockers', 'High-grade hepatotoxicity', 'Liver metastasis', 'Proton pump inhibitors', 'Tyrosine kinase inhibitors']",2020/05/24 06:00,2021/04/23 06:00,['2020/05/24 06:00'],"['2020/02/20 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/23 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/24 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00228-020-02897-x [doi]', '10.1007/s00228-020-02897-x [pii]']",ppublish,Eur J Clin Pharmacol. 2020 Aug;76(8):1183-1191. doi: 10.1007/s00228-020-02897-x.

This prespecified subgroup analysis examined efficacy in patients with renal impairment (RI; estimated glomerular filtration rate <60 mL/min/1.73 m(2)). Isa 10 mg/kg was given intravenously once weekly in cycle 1, and every 2 weeks in subsequent 28-day cycles. Patients received standard doses of Pd. Median progression-free survival (PFS) for patients with RI was 9.5 months with Isa-Pd (n = 55) and 3.7 months with Pd (n = 49; hazard ratio [HR] 0.50; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.30-0.85). Without RI, median PFS was 12.7 months with Isa-Pd (n = 87) and 7.9 months with Pd (n = 96; HR 0.58; 95% CI, 0.38-0.88). The overall response rate (ORR) with and without RI was higher with Isa-Pd (56 and 68%) than Pd (25 and 43%). Complete renal response rates were 71.9% (23/32) with Isa-Pd and 38.1% (8/21) with Pd; these lasted >/=60 days in 31.3% (10/32) and 19.0% (4/21) of patients, respectively. Isa pharmacokinetics were comparable between the subgroups, suggesting no need for dose adjustment in patients with RI. In summary, the addition of Isa to Pd improved PFS, ORR and renal response rates.","['Dimopoulos, Meletios A', 'Leleu, Xavier', 'Moreau, Philippe', 'Richardson, Paul G', 'Liberati, Anna Marina', 'Harrison, Simon J', 'Miles Prince, H', 'Ocio, Enrique M', 'Assadourian, Sylvie', 'Campana, Frank', 'Malinge, Laure', 'Semiond, Dorothee', 'van de Velde, Helgi', 'Yong, Kwee']","['Dimopoulos MA', 'Leleu X', 'Moreau P', 'Richardson PG', 'Liberati AM', 'Harrison SJ', 'Miles Prince H', 'Ocio EM', 'Assadourian S', 'Campana F', 'Malinge L', 'Semiond D', 'van de Velde H', 'Yong K']","['Department of Clinical Therapeutics, School of Medicine, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens School of Medicine, Athens, Greece. mdimop@med.uoa.gr.', 'Department of Hematology, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire, Universite de Poitiers, Poitiers, France.', 'University of Nantes, Nantes, France.', 'Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Oncology-Hematology, Santa Maria Hospital, University of Perugia, Terni, Italy.', 'Clinical Haematology, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre and Royal Melbourne Hospital; Sir Peter MacCallum Department of Oncology, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Epworth Healthcare, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Hospital Universitario Marques de Valdecilla (IDIVAL), Universidad de Cantabria, Santander, Spain.', 'Sanofi R&D, Paris, France.', 'Sanofi-Genzyme Oncology, Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'Aixial (for Sanofi), Boulogne-Billancourt, France.', 'Sanofi R&D, Paris, France.', 'Sanofi-Genzyme Oncology, Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'Department of Haematology, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK.']",['eng'],['N/A/Sanofi'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase III', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200523,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '4Z8R6ORS6L (Thalidomide)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'D2UX06XLB5 (pomalidomide)', 'R30772KCU0 (isatuximab)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Dexamethasone/administration & dosage', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/complications/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Renal Insufficiency/*physiopathology', '*Salvage Therapy', 'Survival Rate', 'Thalidomide/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives']",PMC7862055,,,2020/05/24 06:00,2021/02/26 06:00,['2020/05/24 06:00'],"['2019/12/17 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/04 00:00 [revised]', '2020/05/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/26 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/24 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-020-0868-z [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-020-0868-z [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2021 Feb;35(2):562-572. doi: 10.1038/s41375-020-0868-z.

The European Myeloma Network has provided an expert consensus statement in order to guide therapeutic decisions in the era of the COVID-19 pandemic. Patient education for personal hygiene and social distancing measures, along with treatment individualization, telemedicine and continuous surveillance for early diagnosis of COVID-19 are essential. In countries or local communities where COVID-19 infection is widely spread, MM patients should have a PCR test of nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 before hospital admission, starting a new treatment line, cell apheresis or ASCT in order to avoid ward or community spread and infections. Oral agent-based regimens should be considered, especially for the elderly and frail patients with standard risk disease, whereas de-intensified regimens for dexamethasone, bortezomib, carfilzomib and daratumumab should be used based on patient risk and response. Treatment initiation should not be postponed for patients with end organ damage, myeloma emergencies and aggressive relapses. Autologous (and especially allogeneic) transplantation should be delayed and extended induction should be administered, especially in standard risk patients and those with adequate MM response to induction. Watchful waiting should be considered for standard risk relapsed patients with low tumor burden, and slow biochemical relapses. The conduction of clinical trials should continue with appropriate adaptations to the current circumstances. Patients with MM and symptomatic COVID-19 disease should interrupt anti-myeloma treatment until recovery. For patients with positive PCR test for SARS-CoV-2, but with no symptoms for COVID-19, a 14-day quarantine should be considered if myeloma-related events allow the delay of treatment. The need for surveillance for drug interactions due to polypharmacy is highlighted. The participation in international COVID-19 cancer registries is greatly encouraged.","['Terpos, Evangelos', 'Engelhardt, Monika', 'Cook, Gordon', 'Gay, Francesca', 'Mateos, Maria-Victoria', 'Ntanasis-Stathopoulos, Ioannis', 'van de Donk, Niels W C J', 'Avet-Loiseau, Herve', 'Hajek, Roman', 'Vangsted, Annette Juul', 'Ludwig, Heinz', 'Zweegman, Sonja', 'Moreau, Philippe', 'Einsele, Hermann', 'Boccadoro, Mario', 'San Miguel, Jesus', 'Dimopoulos, Meletios A', 'Sonneveld, Pieter']","['Terpos E', 'Engelhardt M', 'Cook G', 'Gay F', 'Mateos MV', 'Ntanasis-Stathopoulos I', 'van de Donk NWCJ', 'Avet-Loiseau H', 'Hajek R', 'Vangsted AJ', 'Ludwig H', 'Zweegman S', 'Moreau P', 'Einsele H', 'Boccadoro M', 'San Miguel J', 'Dimopoulos MA', 'Sonneveld P']","['Department of Clinical Therapeutics, School of Medicine, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Athens, Greece. eterpos@med.uoa.gr.', 'Faculty of Freiburg, Hematology and Oncology Department, Interdisciplinary Cancer Center (ITZ) and Comprehensive Cancer Center Freiburg (CCCF), University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Leeds Cancer Centre, Leeds Teaching Hospitals National Health Service Trust and University of Leeds, Leeds, UK.', 'Division of Hematology, University of Turin, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Citta della Salute e della Scienza di Torino, Turin, Italy.', 'Cancer Research Unit, University Hospital of Salamanca, Instituto de Investigacion Biomedica de Salamanca (IBSAL), Salamanca, Spain.', 'Institute of Cancer Molecular and Cellular Biology (USAL-CSIC), Centre for Cancer Research (IBMCC), Instituto de Investigacion Biomedica de Salamanca (IBSAL), Salamanca, Spain.', 'Department of Clinical Therapeutics, School of Medicine, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Athens, Greece.', 'Department of Hematology, Cancer Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam UMC, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', ""Genomics of Myeloma Laboratory, L'Institut Universitaire du Cancer Oncopole, Toulouse, France."", 'Department of Hemato-Oncology, University Hospital Ostrava and Faculty of Medicine, University of Ostrava, Ostrava, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Hematology, Copenhagen University Hospital, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Wilhelminen Cancer Research Institute, c/o Department of Medical Oncology, Hematology and Palliative Care, Wilhelminenspital Wien, Austria.', 'Department of Hematology, Cancer Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam UMC, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, University Hospital Hotel-Dieu, Nantes, France.', 'Department of Internal Medicine II, University Hospital of Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany.', 'Division of Hematology, University of Turin, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Citta della Salute e della Scienza di Torino, Turin, Italy.', 'Clinica Universidad de Navarra-Centro de Investigacion Medica Aplicada, Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria de Navarra, Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red de Cancer, Pamplona, Spain.', 'Department of Clinical Therapeutics, School of Medicine, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Athens, Greece.', 'Department of Hematology, Erasmus MC Cancer Institute, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200522,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Betacoronavirus/*isolation & purification', 'COVID-19', 'Coronavirus Infections/epidemiology/*prevention & control/transmission/virology', 'Disease Management', 'Europe/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Infection Control/*methods', 'Multiple Myeloma/*therapy/virology', 'Pandemics/*prevention & control', 'Pneumonia, Viral/epidemiology/*prevention & control/transmission/virology', 'Practice Guidelines as Topic/*standards', 'SARS-CoV-2', '*Telemedicine', 'Time-to-Treatment/*statistics & numerical data']",PMC7244257,,,2020/05/24 06:00,2020/08/11 06:00,['2020/05/24 06:00'],"['2020/04/29 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/06 00:00 [revised]', '2020/05/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/11 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/24 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-020-0876-z [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-020-0876-z [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2020 Aug;34(8):2000-2011. doi: 10.1038/s41375-020-0876-z.

Recently, many researchers have studied the mechanisms of tumor progression related to the tumor microenvironment. Here, we addressed the prognostic value of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) using a total of 232 CRC patient tissue samples and investigated the mechanisms underlying TAM-related colon cancer progression with respect to PI3Kgamma regulation using in vitro, in vivo, and ex vivo approaches. Patients with M2/M1 < 3 had significantly improved progression-free survival and overall survival compared with patients with M2/M1 > 3. M1 and M2 macrophages elicited opposite effects on colon cancer progression via the FBW7-MCL-1 axis. Blocking macrophage PI3Kgamma had cytotoxic effects on colon cancer cells and inhibited epithelial-mesenchymal transition features by regulating the FBW7-MCL-1 axis. The results of this study suggest that macrophage PI3Kgamma may be a promising target for immunotherapy in colon cancer.","['Lee, Yeo Song', 'Song, Su Jeong', 'Hong, Hye Kyung', 'Oh, Bo Young', 'Lee, Woo Yong', 'Cho, Yong Beom']","['Lee YS', 'Song SJ', 'Hong HK', 'Oh BY', 'Lee WY', 'Cho YB']","['Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Institute for Future Medicine Samsung Medical Center, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Institute for Future Medicine Samsung Medical Center, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Institute for Future Medicine Samsung Medical Center, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Colorectal Surgery, Hallym University Sacred Heart Hospital, Hallym University College of Medicine, Anyang, Korea.', 'Department of Surgery, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Health Sciences and Technology, Samsung Advanced Institute for Health Sciences and Technology, Sungkyunkwan University, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Surgery, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea. gscyb@skku.edu.', 'Department of Health Sciences and Technology, Samsung Advanced Institute for Health Sciences and Technology, Sungkyunkwan University, Seoul, Republic of Korea. gscyb@skku.edu.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200522,United States,Exp Mol Med,Experimental & molecular medicine,9607880,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (F-Box-WD Repeat-Containing Protein 7)', '0 (FBXW7 protein, human)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.1.137 (Class Ib Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.1.137 (PIK3CG protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Biomarkers', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement', 'Cell Plasticity/genetics/*immunology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Class Ib Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase/metabolism', 'Colonic Neoplasms/etiology/metabolism/pathology/therapy', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition/drug effects/genetics/immunology', 'F-Box-WD Repeat-Containing Protein 7/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Macrophage Activation/genetics/*immunology', 'Macrophages/drug effects/*immunology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*metabolism', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Prognosis', 'Tumor-Associated Macrophages/drug effects/immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",PMC7272616,,,2020/05/24 06:00,2021/07/31 06:00,['2020/05/24 06:00'],"['2019/06/25 00:00 [received]', '2020/04/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/23 00:00 [revised]', '2020/05/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/31 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/24 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s12276-020-0436-7 [doi]', '10.1038/s12276-020-0436-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Exp Mol Med. 2020 May;52(5):815-831. doi: 10.1038/s12276-020-0436-7.

We presently characterize human beta cell responses to IFNalpha by combining ATAC-seq, RNA-seq and proteomics assays. The initial response to IFNalpha is characterized by chromatin remodeling, followed by changes in transcriptional and translational regulation. IFNalpha induces changes in alternative splicing (AS) and first exon usage, increasing the diversity of transcripts expressed by the beta cells. This, combined with changes observed on protein modification/degradation, ER stress and MHC class I, may expand antigens presented by beta cells to the immune system. Beta cells also up-regulate the checkpoint proteins PDL1 and HLA-E that may exert a protective role against the autoimmune assault. Data mining of the present multi-omics analysis identifies two compound classes that antagonize IFNalpha effects on human beta cells.","['Colli, Maikel L', 'Ramos-Rodriguez, Mireia', 'Nakayasu,

32444465,NLM,MEDLINE,20211129,20211129,2159-8290 (Electronic) 2159-8274 (Linking),10,9,2020 Sep,Posttranslational Regulation of the Exon Skipping Machinery Controls Aberrant Splicing in Leukemia.,1388-1409,10.1158/2159-8290.CD-19-1436 [doi],"Splicing alterations are common in diseases such as cancer, where mutations in splicing factor genes are frequently responsible for aberrant splicing. Here we present an alternative mechanism for splicing regulation in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) that involves posttranslational stabilization of the splicing machinery via deubiquitination. We demonstrate there are extensive exon skipping changes in disease, affecting proteasomal subunits, cell-cycle regulators, and the RNA machinery. We present that the serine/arginine-rich splicing factors (SRSF), controlling exon skipping, are critical for leukemia cell survival. The ubiquitin-specific peptidase 7 (USP7) regulates SRSF6 protein levels via active deubiquitination, and USP7 inhibition alters the exon skipping pattern and blocks T-ALL growth. The splicing inhibitor H3B-8800 affects splicing of proteasomal transcripts and proteasome activity and acts synergistically with proteasome inhibitors in inhibiting T-ALL growth. Our study provides the proof-of-principle for regulation of splicing factors via deubiquitination and suggests new therapeutic modalities in T-ALL. SIGNIFICANCE: Our study provides a new proof-of-principle for posttranslational regulation of splicing factors independently of mutations in aggressive T-cell leukemia. It further suggests a new drug combination of splicing and proteasomal inhibitors, a concept that might apply to other diseases with or without mutations affecting the splicing machinery.This article

Here, we demonstrated that ASC-deficient CD8(+) T cells failed to induce severe graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and had impaired capacity for graft rejection and graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) activity. These effects were inflammasome independent because GVHD lethality was not altered in recipients of caspase-1/11-deficient T cells. We also demonstrated that ASC deficiency resulted in a decrease in cytolytic function, with a reduction in granzyme B secretion and CD107a expression by CD8(+) T cells.

The present case reports a lysozyme nephropathy secondary to chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. OBSERVATION: We reported a case of a 82-years-old woman who presented an acute renal failure in a context of diarrhea and vomiting. Her background was characterized by untreated chronic myelomonocytic leukemia and high blood pressure. Despite rehydration, renal function deteriorated. Renal biopsy revealed a tubulo-interstitial lysozyme-induced nephropathy with a vacuolization of the tubular epithelium by eosinophilic droplets stained by anti-lysozyme antibody, without tumoral infiltration of the renal parenchyma. CONCLUSION: Lysozyme-induced nephropathy is a rare disease which can be suspected biologically and needs histologic confirmation. Other causes of renal failure secondary to chronic myelomonocytic leukemia have to be eliminated first in these patients. The treatment is symptomatic and is associated with treatments of the underlying hematologic pathology.","['Robinet-Zimmermann, Gwladys', 'Rioux-Leclercq, Nathalie', 'Frouget, Thierry', 'Le Naoures, Cecile']","['Robinet-Zimmermann G', 'Rioux-Leclercq N', 'Frouget T', 'Le Naoures C']","[""Service d'anatomie et cytologie pathologiques, CHU Pontchaillou, 2, rue Henri le Guilloux, 35033 Rennes cedex 9, France.

Decrease of global longitudinal strain is a predictor for heart failure. Early detection of subclinical cardiotoxicity is crucial for timely intervention and prevention of further progression. Cardiac function of 41 survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) was assessed. Values of cardiac troponin T, N-terminal-pro-brain natriuretic peptide, conventional and myocardial 2D strain echocardiography were measured before (T=0), during (T=1, cumulative dose of 120 mg/m(2)), shortly after (T=2) and long after anthracycline treatment (T=3, >/=5 years after anthracycline exposure). Cardiac function of survivors at the latest follow up was compared with 70 healthy age-matched controls. None of the survivors showed clinical signs of cardiac failure at T=3. Strain values decreased during anthracycline treatment and an ongoing reduction was seen at the latest follow-up (T=3) with preserved cardiac function (normal ejection fraction and shortening fraction). At T=1, a relative reduction in longitudinal strain (>/=10% compared with baseline) was observed in 38% of the survivors, which increased to 54% at T=3. ALL survivors showed significantly lower conventional and myocardial 2D strain values, especially strain rate, compared with healthy age-matched controls. At T=3, we did not find any abnormal cardiac troponin T levels. Six percent of the survivors showed abnormal N-terminal-pro-brain natriuretic peptide levels. This prospective study showed an ongoing reduction of 2D myocardial strain and strain rate, with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (</=10% decrease compared with baseline) in asymptomatic ALL survivors at late follow-up.","['Pourier, Milanthy S', 'Mavinkurve-Groothuis, Annelies M C', 'Dull, Myrthe M', 'Weijers, Gert', 'Loonen, Jacqueline', 'Bellersen, Louise', 'de Korte, Chris L', 'Kapusta, Livia']","['Pourier MS', 'Mavinkurve-Groothuis AMC', 'Dull MM', 'Weijers G', 'Loonen J', 'Bellersen L', 'de Korte CL', 'Kapusta L']","[""Department of Pediatrics, Amalia Children's Hospital, Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen, the Netherlands; Department of Radiology and Nuclear Medicine, Medical UltraSound Imaging Centre (MUSIC), Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen, the Netherlands.

Although next-generation therapeutics are urgently needed, the early stage of the drug discovery process is hampered by very low hit rates from intracellular Leishmania phenotypic high-throughput screenings. Designing and applying a physiologically relevant in vitro assay is therefore in high demand. In this study, we characterized the infectivity, morphology, and drug susceptibility of different Leishmania and host cell infection combinations. Primary bone marrow-derived macrophage (BMDM) and differentiated human acute monocytic leukemia (THP-1) cells were infected with amastigote or promastigote forms of Leishmania amazonensis and Leishmania donovani. Regardless of host cell types, amastigotes were generally well phagocytosed and showed high infectivity, whereas promastigotes, especially those of L. donovani, had predominantly remained in the extracellular space. In the drug susceptibility test, miltefosine and sodium stibogluconate (SSG) showed varying ranges of activity with 14 and >10-fold differences in susceptibility, depending on the host-parasite pairs, indicating the importance of assay conditions for evaluating antileishmanial activity. Overall, our results suggest that combinations of Leishmania species, infection forms, and host cells must be carefully optimized to evaluate the activity of potential therapeutic compounds against Leishmania.","['Baek, Kyung-Hwa', 'Piel, Laura', 'Rosazza, Thibault', 'Prina, Eric', 'Spath, Gerald F', 'No, Joo Hwan']","['Baek KH', 'Piel L', 'Rosazza T', 'Prina E', 'Spath GF', 'No JH']","['Leishmania Research Laboratory, Institut Pasteur Korea, Seongnam-si, Gyeonggi-do 13488, Korea.', 'Institut Pasteur, Unite de Parasitologie Moleculaire et Signalisation, 75015 Paris, France.', 'Institut Pasteur, Unite de Parasitologie Moleculaire et Signalisation, 75015 Paris, France.', 'Institut Pasteur, Unite de Parasitologie Moleculaire et Signalisation, 75015 Paris, France.', 'Institut Pasteur, Unite de Parasitologie Moleculaire et Signalisation, 75015 Paris, France.', 'Leishmania Research Laboratory, Institut Pasteur Korea, Seongnam-si, Gyeonggi-do 13488, Korea.']",['eng'],"['NRF-2017M3A9G6068246/National Research Foundation of Korea', 'NRF-2017R1D1A1B03033204/National Research Foundation of Korea', 'PTR593/international division of institut pasteur']",['Journal Article'],20200520,Switzerland,Pathogens,"Pathogens (Basel, Switzerland)",101596317,,,,PMC7281264,['NOTNLM'],"['Leishmania amazonensis', 'Leishmania donovani', 'THP-1', 'drugs', 'primary bone marrow-derived macrophage', 'susceptibility']",2020/05/24 06:00,2020/05/24 06:01,['2020/05/24 06:00'],"['2020/03/20 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/18 00:00 [revised]', '2020/05/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/05/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/24 06:01 [medline]']","['pathogens9050393 [pii]', '10.3390/pathogens9050393 [doi]']",epublish,Pathogens. 2020 May 20;9(5). pii: pathogens9050393. doi: 10.3390/pathogens9050393.,,['The authors declare no conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Luzulasylvatica, a Juncaceae species, is widely present in the Auvergne region of France, but has neverbeen studied neither for its phytochemical profile nor for its biological properties. We investigatedthe phytochemical profile and evaluated the potential anti-inflammatory activities of L. sylvaticaaerial parts extracts. A bioassay-guided fractionation was carried out to identify the most activefractions. Nine compounds were isolated, one coumarin 1 and eight phenanthrene derivatives (2-9), including four new compounds (4, 5, 8 and 9), from n-hexane and CH2Cl2, fractions.

We recently developed a reliable in vitro method to generate HLA-DPB1 mismatch-reactive CD4 T-cell clones from allogeneic donors. Here, we isolated HLA-DPB1 specific T cell receptors (TCR DP) and used them either as wild-type or genetically optimized receptors to analyze in detail the reactivity of transduced CD4 and CD8 T cells toward primary AML blasts. While both CD4 and CD8 T cells showed strong AML reactivity in vitro, only CD4 T cells were able to effectively eliminate leukemia blasts in AML engrafted NOD/SCID/IL2Rgammac(-/-) (NSG) mice. Further analysis showed that optimized TCR DP and under some conditions wild-type TCR DP also mediated reactivity to non-hematopoietic cells like fibroblasts or tumor cell lines after HLA-DP upregulation. In conclusion, T cells engineered with selected allo-HLA-DPB1 specific TCRs might be powerful off-the-shelf reagents in allogeneic T-cell therapy of leukemia. However, because of frequent (common) cross-reactivity to non-hematopoietic cells with optimized TCR DP T cells, safety mechanisms are mandatory.","['Klobuch, Sebastian', 'Hammon, Kathrin', 'Vatter-Leising, Sarah', 'Neidlinger, Elisabeth', 'Zwerger, Michael', 'Wandel, Annika', 'Neuber, Laura Maria', 'Heilmeier, Bernhard', 'Fichtner, Regina', 'Mirbeth, Carina', 'Herr, Wolfgang', 'Thomas, Simone']","['Klobuch S', 'Hammon K', 'Vatter-Leising S', 'Neidlinger E', 'Zwerger M', 'Wandel A', 'Neuber LM', 'Heilmeier B', 'Fichtner R', 'Mirbeth C', 'Herr W', 'Thomas S']","['Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital Regensburg, 93042 Regensburg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital Regensburg, 93042 Regensburg, Germany.', 'Regensburg Center for Interventional Immunology, University of Regensburg, 93042 Regensburg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital Regensburg, 93042 Regensburg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital Regensburg, 93042 Regensburg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital Regensburg, 93042 Regensburg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital Regensburg, 93042 Regensburg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital Regensburg, 93042 Regensburg, Germany.', 'Department of Oncology and Hematology, Hospital Barmherzige Brueder, 93049 Regensburg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital Regensburg, 93042 Regensburg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital Regensburg, 93042 Regensburg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital Regensburg, 93042 Regensburg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital Regensburg, 93042 Regensburg, Germany.', 'Regensburg Center for Interventional Immunology, University of Regensburg, 93042 Regensburg, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200520,Switzerland,Cells,Cells,101600052,"['0 (HLA-DP beta-Chains)', '0 (HLA-DPB1 antigen)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",IM,"['Alleles', 'Animals', 'Blast Crisis/immunology/pathology', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Female', 'Fibroblasts/pathology', 'HLA-DP beta-Chains/genetics/*immunology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Humans', '*Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Mice', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*immunology', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",PMC7290340,['NOTNLM'],"['*HLA-DP', '*TCR gene therapy', '*adoptive immunotherapy', '*allogeneic stem cell transplantation', '*graft versus leukemia reaction']",2020/05/24 06:00,2021/02/26 06:00,['2020/05/24 06:00'],"['2020/04/20 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/07 00:00 [revised]', '2020/05/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/05/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/26 06:00 [medline]']","['cells9051264 [pii]', '10.3390/cells9051264 [doi]']",epublish,Cells. 2020 May 20;9(5). pii: cells9051264. doi: 10.3390/cells9051264.,['ORCID: 0000-0003-1364-0763'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Records of patients diagnosed with CP CML, treated with TKIs and referred to our center were reviewed. Between January 2005 and April 2016, 206 patients were followed for a median of 48.8 (1.4-190.1) months. A total of 76 (37%) patients received one TKI, 73 (35%) received two TKIs and 57 (28%) were exposed to >3 TKIs (3 TKIs, n = 33; 4 TKIs, n = 17; 5 TKIs, n = 7). Nineteen (9.2%) patients progressed to advanced phases of CML (accelerated phase, n = 6; myeloid blastic phase, n = 4; lymphoid blastic phase, n = 9). One third (n = 69) achieved complete molecular response (CMR) at first-line treatment. An additional 55 patients achieved CMR after second-line treatment. Twenty-five patients (12.1%) attempted TKI discontinuation and 14 (6.8%) stopped TKIs for a median of 6.3 months (range 1-53.4).

During V2a and V2b diversification, Tal1 is necessary and sufficient to promote V2b differentiation and Vsx2 suppresses the expression of motor neuron genes to consolidate V2a interneuron identity. The expression program of Tal1 is triggered by a Foxn4-driven regulatory network in the common P2 progenitors. Why the expression of Tal1 is inhibited in V2a interneurons at the onset of V2a and V2b sub-lineage diversification remains unclear. Since transcription repressor Vsx1 is expressed in the P2 progenitors and newborn V2a cells in zebrafish, we investigated the role of Vsx1 in V2a fate specification during V2a and V2b interneuron diversification in this species by loss and gain-of-function experiments. In vsx1 knockdown embryos or knockout Go chimeric embryos, tal1 was ectopically expressed in the presumptive V2a cells, while the generation of V2a interneurons was significantly suppressed. By contrast, in vsx1 overexpression embryos, normal expression of tal1 in the presumptive V2b cells was suppressed, while the generation of V2a interneuron was expanded. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and electrophoretic mobility shift assays in combination with core consensus sequence mutation analysis further revealed that Vsx1 can directly bind to tal1 promoter and repress tal1 transcription. These results indicate that Vsx1 can directly repress tal1 transcription and plays an essential role in defining V2a interneuron sub-lineage during V2a and V2b sub-lineage diversification in zebrafish.","['Zhang, Qi', 'Xu, Haomang', 'Zhao, Wei', 'Zheng, Jianbo', 'Sun, Lei', 'Luo, Chen']","['Zhang Q', 'Xu H', 'Zhao W', 'Zheng J', 'Sun L', 'Luo C']","['College of Life Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310058, China.', 'College of Life Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310058, China.', 'College of Life Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310058, China.', 'College of Life Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310058, China.', 'Zhejiang Institute of Freshwater Fisheries, Huzhou 313001, China.', 'College of Life Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310058, China.', 'College of Life Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310058, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200520,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,"['0 (Eye Proteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Zebrafish Proteins)', '0 (tal1 protein, zebrafish)', '0 (vsx1 protein, zebrafish)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Lineage', 'Eye Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Interneurons/cytology/*metabolism', 'Neurogenesis', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Binding', 'Spinal Cord/cytology/embryology/metabolism', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1/*genetics/metabolism', 'Zebrafish', 'Zebrafish Proteins/*genetics/*metabolism']",PMC7279403,['NOTNLM'],"['Tal1', 'V2 interneuron diversification', 'V2a interneuron specification', 'Vsx1', 'spinal cord', 'transcriptional repression', 'zebrafish']",2020/05/24 06:00,2021/02/17 06:00,['2020/05/24 06:00'],"['2020/04/18 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/11 00:00 [revised]', '2020/05/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/05/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/17 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms21103600 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms21103600 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2020 May 20;21(10). pii: ijms21103600. doi: 10.3390/ijms21103600.,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-9207-858X', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6795-0252']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Eradicating the leukemic stem cells (LSCs) is the ultimate challenge in the treatment of AML. Emerging evidence suggests that AML remodels the bone marrow (BM) niche into a leukemia-permissive microenvironment while suppressing normal hematopoiesis. The mechanism of stromal-mediated protection of leukemic cells in the BM is complex and involves many adhesion molecules, chemokines, and cytokines. Targeting these factors may represent a valuable approach to complement existing therapies and overcome microenvironment-mediated drug resistance. Some strategies for dislodging LSCs and leukemic blasts from their protective niche have already been tested in patients and are in different phases of the process of clinical development. Other strategies, such as targeting the stromal cells remodeling processes, remain at pre-clinical stages. Development of humanized xenograft mouse models, which overcome the mismatch between human leukemia cells and the mouse BM niche, is required to generate physiologically relevant, patient-specific human niches in mice that can be used to unravel the role of human AML microenvironment and to carry out preclinical studies for the development of new targeted therapies.","['Pievani, Alice', 'Biondi, Marta', 'Tomasoni, Chiara', 'Biondi, Andrea', 'Serafini, Marta']","['Pievani A', 'Biondi M', 'Tomasoni C', 'Biondi A', 'Serafini M']","['Centro Ricerca M.

On the basis of these principles, a strategy was developed for measurable residual disease (MRD) assessment. Herein, suspicious cell clusters are first identified at diagnosis using a clustering algorithm. Subsequently, automated multidimensional spaces, named ""Clouds"", are created around these clusters on the basis of density calculations. This step identifies the immunophenotypic pattern of the suspicious cell clusters. Thereafter, using reference samples, the ""Abnormality Ratio"" (AR) of each Cloud is calculated, and major malignant Clouds are retained, known as ""Leukemic Clouds"" (L-Clouds). In follow-up samples, MRD is identified when more cells fall into a patient's L-Cloud compared to reference samples (AR concept). This workflow was applied on simulated data and real-life leukemia flow cytometry data. On simulated data, strong patient-dependent positive correlation (R(2) = 1) was observed between the AR and spiked-in leukemia cells. On real patient data, AR kinetics was in line with the clinical evolution for five out of six patients. In conclusion, we present a convenient flow cytometry data analysis approach for the follow-up of hematological malignancies. Further evaluation and validation on more patient samples and different flow cytometry panels is required before implementation in clinical practice.","['Jacqmin, Hugues', 'Chatelain, Bernard', 'Louveaux, Quentin', 'Jacqmin, Philippe', 'Dogne, Jean-Michel', 'Graux, Carlos', 'Mullier, Francois']","['Jacqmin H', 'Chatelain B', 'Louveaux Q', 'Jacqmin P', 'Dogne JM', 'Graux C', 'Mullier F']","['Hematology Laboratory, NAmur Research Institute for LIfe Sciences (NARILIS), Namur Thrombosis and Hemostasis Center (NTHC), CHU UCL Namur, Universite catholique de Louvain, 5530 Yvoir, Belgium.', 'Hematology Laboratory, NAmur Research Institute for LIfe Sciences (NARILIS), Namur Thrombosis and Hemostasis Center (NTHC), CHU UCL Namur, Universite catholique de Louvain, 5530 Yvoir, Belgium.', 'Montefiore Institute, University of Liege, 4000 Liege, Belgium.', 'MnS-Modelling and Simulation, 5500 Dinant, Belgium.', 'Pharmacy Department, University of Namur, 5000 Namur, Belgium.', 'Department of Hematology, Namur Research Institute for Life Sciences (NARILIS), Namur Thrombosis and Hemostasis Center (NTHC), CHU UCL Namur, Universite catholique de Louvain, 5530 Yvoir, Belgium.', 'Hematology Laboratory, NAmur Research Institute for LIfe Sciences (NARILIS), Namur Thrombosis and Hemostasis Center (NTHC), CHU UCL Namur, Universite catholique de Louvain, 5530 Yvoir, Belgium.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200518,Switzerland,Diagnostics (Basel),"Diagnostics (Basel, Switzerland)",101658402,,,,PMC7277972,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia (AML)', 'clustering', 'flow cytometry', 'kernel density estimation', 'multiparametric data analysis', 'personalized medicine']",2020/05/24 06:00,2020/05/24 06:01,['2020/05/24 06:00'],"['2020/03/26 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/12 00:00 [revised]', '2020/05/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/05/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/24 06:01 [medline]']","['diagnostics10050317 [pii]', '10.3390/diagnostics10050317 [doi]']",epublish,Diagnostics (Basel). 2020 May 18;10(5). pii: diagnostics10050317. doi: 10.3390/diagnostics10050317.,['ORCID: 0000-0003-0901-3732'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study of our research, a quick and simple bioanalytical method based on ultra performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) technique was fully explored and established for the quantification of plasma duvelisib concentrations from beagle dog in which gilteritinib was used as the internal standard (IS). After a simple and quick protein precipitation treated with acetonitrile, the chromatographic separation of the analyte was carried out on an Acquity BEH C18 column (2.1mmx50mm, 1.7mum) conducted in a gradient elution procedure where acetonitrile (solvent A) and 0.1 % formic acid in water (solvent B) consisted as the mobile phase. The measurements of the analyte and IS were explored using a XEVO TQS triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometer, which was comprised with electrospray ionization (ESI) source in positive ion mode. Selected reaction monitoring (SRM) mode was employed to detect the parent-to-daughter ion transitions as follows: m/z 416.88 --> 281.88 for duvelisib, and m/z 553.09 --> 436.01 for IS, respectively. The assay was successfully established in the calibration range from 0.5 to 3000ng/mL for duvelisib, where the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) was set at 0.5ng/mL. The precisions of intra-day and inter-day for duvelisib were all below 12.6 %, and the accuracies were from -2.5% to 14.1%. Both matrix effect and mean recovery of the analyte and IS were all acceptable, and the analyte was stable during the assay and storage in dog plasma samples. The novel established bioanalytical method based on UPLC-MS/MS technique was effectively employed to the investigation of the pharmacokinetic profile of duvelisib in beagle dogs following a 1.34mg/kg single dose of oral administration.","['Shao, Yuanyuan', 'Xie, Saili', 'Zhu, Huidan', 'Du, Xiaoxiang', 'Xu, Ren-Ai']","['Shao Y', 'Xie S', 'Zhu H', 'Du X', 'Xu RA']","['The First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, 325000 Wenzhou, PR China.', 'The First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, 325000 Wenzhou, PR China.', 'The First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, 325000 Wenzhou, PR China.', 'The First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, 325000 Wenzhou, PR China.

DepoCyt is a human liposomal cytarabine (LC) product that lasts longer in plasma and CSF compared with free CA (FC). The use of LC has not been evaluated in dogs. OBJECTIVES: To perform a LC pharmacokinetic (PK) study when administered SC in dogs. ANIMALS: Five healthy female beagles. METHODS: Three-period, 3-treatment, nonblinded, randomized, and crossover design, including a pilot study. LC was administered at 50 mg/m(2) SC and FC was administered at 25 and 50 mg/m(2) SC and IV. Plasma CA concentrations were measured until 240, 72, and 8 hours after SC LC, SC FC, and IV FC administration, respectively. CA plasma concentrations were quantitated by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry (MS/MS) detection and concentration-time profiles were evaluated by noncompartmental analysis. RESULTS: Subcutaneous LC administration resulted in a maximum plasma concentration of 26.3 to 59.78 ng/mL, time to reach maximum plasma concentration of 2 hours, area under the concentration-time curve to last measurable concentration of 669.3 to 1126 h x ng/mL, and plasma bioavailability (%F) of 19.6% to 31.3%. The PK profiles of FC after SC and IV administration differed when compared with LC. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: In healthy dogs, SC LC administration at 50 mg/m(2) results in measurable plasma CA concentrations, is apparently safe and well tolerated, but does not result in prolonged cytotoxic plasma concentrations. Poor absorption of LC prevented establishment of a complete LC PK profile.","['Vazquez Fuster, Irene B', 'Taylor, Amanda R', 'Smith, Annette N', 'Duran, Sue H', 'Ravis, William R', 'Jasper, Shanese L', 'Arnold, Robert D']","['Vazquez Fuster IB', 'Taylor AR', 'Smith AN', 'Duran SH', 'Ravis WR', 'Jasper SL', 'Arnold RD']","['Department of Oncology, VCA Hollywood Animal Hospital, Hollywood, Florida, USA.', 'Department of Neurology, MedVet Columbus, Worthington, Ohio, USA.', 'Department of Clinical Sciences, Wilford and Kate Bailey Small Animal Teaching Hospital, Auburn University College of Veterinary Medicine, Auburn, Alabama, USA.', 'J.T.

We performed comprehensive genomic studies on paired bone marrow and tissue samples as well as on flow cytometry-sorted bone marrow and peripheral blood subpopulations from a cohort of 22 patients with TCL-TFH to identify shared CH-type mutations in various hematopoietic cell compartments. Identical mutations were detected in the neoplastic T-cell and myeloid compartments of 15 out of 22 patients (68%), including TET2 (14/15) and DNMT3A (10/15). Four patients developed MNs, all of which shared CH-type mutations with their TCL-TFH; additional unique genetic alterations were also detected in each patient's TCL-TFH and MN. These data demonstrate that CH is prevalent in patients with TCL-TFH and that divergent evolution of a CH clone may give rise to both TCL-TFH and MNs.","['Lewis, Natasha E', 'Petrova-Drus, Kseniya', 'Huet, Sarah', 'Epstein-Peterson, Zachary D', 'Gao, Qi', 'Sigler, Allison E', 'Baik, Jeeyeon', 'Ozkaya, Neval', 'Moskowitz, Alison J', 'Kumar, Anita', 'Horwitz, Steven M', 'Zhang, Yanming', 'Arcila, Maria E', 'Levine, Ross L', 'Roshal, Mikhail', 'Dogan, Ahmet', 'Xiao, Wenbin']","['Lewis NE', 'Petrova-Drus K', 'Huet S', 'Epstein-Peterson ZD', 'Gao Q', 'Sigler AE', 'Baik J', 'Ozkaya N', 'Moskowitz AJ', 'Kumar A', 'Horwitz SM', 'Zhang Y', 'Arcila ME', 'Levine RL', 'Roshal M', 'Dogan A', 'Xiao W']","['Hematopathology Service, Department of Pathology.', 'Hematopathology Service, Department of Pathology.', 'Hematopathology Service, Department of Pathology.', 'Lymphoma Service, Department of Medicine.', 'Hematopathology Service, Department of Pathology.', 'Hematopathology Service, Department of Pathology.', 'Hematopathology Service, Department of Pathology.', 'Hematopathology Service, Department of Pathology.', 'Lymphoma Service, Department of Medicine.', 'Lymphoma Service, Department of Medicine.', 'Lymphoma Service, Department of Medicine.', 'Cytogenetic Laboratory, Department of Pathology.', 'Molecular Diagnostic Laboratory, Department of Pathology.', 'Molecular Cancer Medicine Service, Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program.', 'Leukemia Service, Department of Medicine, and.', 'Center for Hematologic Malignancies, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Hematopathology Service, Department of Pathology.', 'Hematopathology Service, Department of Pathology.', 'Hematopathology Service, Department of Pathology.', 'Molecular Cancer Medicine Service, Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program.', 'Center for Hematologic Malignancies, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.']",['eng'],"['P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA192937/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,,IM,"['Clonal Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', '*Immunoblastic Lymphadenopathy/genetics', '*Lymphoma, T-Cell/genetics', 'Mutation', 'T-Lymphocytes, Helper-Inducer']",PMC7252546,,,2020/05/23 06:00,2021/05/15 06:00,['2020/05/23 06:00'],"['2020/02/10 00:00 [received]', '2020/04/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/15 06:00 [medline]']","['S2473-9529(20)31302-1 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2020001636 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Adv. 2020 May 26;4(10):2261-2271. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2020001636.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Such models are therefore essential for developing new drugs and preventing the failure of clinical treatments. However, high-throughput cell cluster assembly and fabricating individual 3D environments that mimic the extracellular matrix (ECM) remain significant challenges. To rapidly produce mini 3D multicellular aggregate units, acoustic force assembly combined with ECM mimic hydrogel array encapsulation is developed and then integrated into a diffusion-based microfluidic device for high-throughput drug testing. The active acoustic force gathers human mononuclear leukemia cells (THP-1) into hundreds of multicellular clusters with a controllable size. Instead of continuous bulk materials, photosensitive gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) hydrogel pillar arrays containing cell clusters at drug concentration gradients are obtained through selective area exposure. Ten azelaic acid (AZA) concentration gradient series are applied to 100 units to simultaneously test the multicellular cluster drug resistance to multiple drug conditions. Real-time green fluorescent protein (GFP) fluorescence is analyzed to monitor cell viability. The results show that cell aggregate activity is inversely related to the drug concentration in the hydrogel pillars, and shows lower sensitivity to drug toxicity than the activity of monolayer cultured cells. The 3D multicellular arrays provide numerous in vitro tumor models and can be directly used for downstream drug testing. This technology inherits the advantages of acoustic assembly, while being more flexible, practical, and high-throughput, and shows significant potential for use in further tumor related research and clinical practice.","['Hu, Xuejia', 'Zhao, Shukun', 'Luo, Ziyi', 'Zuo, Yunfeng', 'Wang, Fang', 'Zhu, Jiaomeng', 'Chen, Longfei', 'Yang, Dongyong', 'Zheng, Yajing', 'Zheng, Yujia', 'Cheng, Yanxiang', 'Zhou, Fuling', 'Yang, Yi']","['Hu X', 'Zhao S', 'Luo Z', 'Zuo Y', 'Wang F', 'Zhu J', 'Chen L', 'Yang D', 'Zheng Y', 'Zheng Y', 'Cheng Y', 'Zhou F', 'Yang Y']","['School of Physics & Technology, Key Laboratory of Artificial Micro/Nano Structure of Ministry of Education, Wuhan University, Wuhan 430072, China. yangyiys@whu.edu.cn and Shenzhen Research Institute, Wuhan University, Shenzhen 518000, China.', 'School of Physics & Technology, Key Laboratory of Artificial Micro/Nano Structure of Ministry of Education, Wuhan University, Wuhan 430072, China. yangyiys@whu.edu.cn and Shenzhen Research Institute, Wuhan University, Shenzhen 518000, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan University, Wuhan 430071, China.', 'School of Physics & Technology, Key Laboratory of Artificial Micro/Nano Structure of Ministry of Education, Wuhan University, Wuhan 430072, China. yangyiys@whu.edu.cn and Shenzhen Research Institute, Wuhan University, Shenzhen 518000, China.', 'School of Physics & Technology, Key Laboratory of Artificial Micro/Nano Structure of Ministry of Education, Wuhan University, Wuhan 430072, China. yangyiys@whu.edu.cn and Shenzhen Research Institute, Wuhan University, Shenzhen 518000, China.', 'School of Physics & Technology, Key Laboratory of Artificial Micro/Nano Structure of Ministry of Education, Wuhan University, Wuhan 430072, China. yangyiys@whu.edu.cn and Shenzhen Research Institute, Wuhan University, Shenzhen 518000, China.', 'School of Physics & Technology, Key Laboratory of Artificial Micro/Nano Structure of Ministry of Education, Wuhan University, Wuhan 430072, China. yangyiys@whu.edu.cn and Shenzhen Research Institute, Wuhan University, Shenzhen 518000, China.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan University, Wuhan 430060, China.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan University, Wuhan 430060, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan University, Wuhan 430071, China.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan University, Wuhan 430060, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan University, Wuhan 430071, China.', 'School of Physics & Technology, Key Laboratory of Artificial Micro/Nano Structure of Ministry of Education, Wuhan University, Wuhan 430072, China. yangyiys@whu.edu.cn and Shenzhen Research Institute, Wuhan University, Shenzhen 518000, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Lab Chip,Lab on a chip,101128948,"['0 (Hydrogels)', '9000-70-8 (Gelatin)']",IM,"['Acoustics', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells, Cultured', '*Gelatin', 'Humans', '*Hydrogels']",,,,2020/05/23 06:00,2021/06/22 06:00,['2020/05/23 06:00'],"['2020/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/22 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/23 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1039/d0lc00255k [doi]'],ppublish,Lab Chip. 2020 Jun 16;20(12):2228-2236. doi: 10.1039/d0lc00255k.,['ORCID: 0000-0003-0693-9193'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Whether the levels of circulating bFGF are increased or not in untreated AML patients is still not clear. In order to acquire a more definite evaluation, a meta-analysis was performed.Material and methods: We searched PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang, and VIP databases for possible eligible articles. Forest plot was used to present the combined effect values and 95% confidence intervals (CI) through the random-effect model. Subgroup analysis was performed based on sample size, sample type, and region. All statistical analysis was performed in STATA12.0 software.Results: After excluding the articles that did not meet the inclusion criteria, 11 studies that met the inclusion conditions were included in this meta-analysis. Overall, AML patients probably had higher circulating levels of bFGF (SMD = 1.15, 95% CI: 0.35-1.94). The results of sensitivity analysis indicated that the results were stable. Moreover, the trim and fill analysis showed that publication bias had little effect and the results were relatively robust. In addition, AML patients with N < 30 group, serum group, and Asia group (all P < 0.05) had higher circulating bFGF levels, whereas other subgroups showed no significant change.Conclusion: The results of current meta-analysis revealed that AML patients had higher circulating bFGF levels, and it was associated with sample type, sample size, and region. Considering the possible pathogenic role of bFGF in AML, drug development targeting bFGF is very promising for AML patients.","['Song, Ming-Zhu', 'Mao, Yan-Mei', 'Wu, Jun', 'Pan, Hai-Feng', 'Ye, Qian-Ling']","['Song MZ', 'Mao YM', 'Wu J', 'Pan HF', 'Ye QL']","[""Department of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University, Hefei, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, People's Republic of China."", ""Anhui Province Key Laboratory of Major Autoimmune Diseases, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, People's Republic of China."", ""Anhui Province Key Laboratory of Major Autoimmune Diseases, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, People's Republic of China."", ""Anhui Province Key Laboratory of Major Autoimmune Diseases, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University, Hefei, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis']",,England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,['103107-01-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 2)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 2/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*blood', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Biological markers', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'basic fibroblast growth factor', 'meta-analysis']",2020/05/23 06:00,2020/12/15 06:00,['2020/05/23 06:00'],"['2020/05/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/16078454.2020.1766865 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematology. 2020 Dec;25(1):186-193. doi: 10.1080/16078454.2020.1766865.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The sample consisted of 1,913 hospitalizations of children, younger than 21 years, in the United States during the year 2016 with documentation of both AML and at least one infectious complication. Binary logistic regression models were used to examine the association between race/ethnicity and severe sepsis in children with AML and infection. We found that, after controlling for potential confounding variables, the odds of developing severe sepsis were significantly increased for Hispanic children compared with White children. There were no significant differences in the likelihood of the development of sepsis in Black, Asian, or other race children. The increased risk of severe sepsis for Hispanic children may contribute to the disparate rates of overall survival in this group. This inequitable rate of severe sepsis was evident despite the generally accepted practice of retaining children in the hospital throughout recovery of blood counts following AML therapy. Nurses are in a position to identify and eliminate modifiable risk factors contributing to this disparity.","['Savage, Beth', 'Thomas-Hawkins, Charlotte', 'Cole, Peter D', 'Stapleton, Jerod L', 'de Cordova, Pamela B']","['Savage B', 'Thomas-Hawkins C', 'Cole PD', 'Stapleton JL', 'de Cordova PB']","['State University of New Jersey, Newark, NJ, USA.', 'State University of New Jersey, Newark, NJ, USA.', 'Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey, New Brunswick, NJ, USA.', 'University of Kentucky College of Public Health, Lexington, KY, USA.', 'State University of New Jersey, Newark, NJ, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20200522,United States,J Pediatr Oncol Nurs,Journal of pediatric oncology nursing : official journal of the Association of Pediatric Oncology Nurses,8917825,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'African Americans/statistics & numerical data', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Healthcare Disparities/ethnology/*statistics & numerical data', 'Hispanic or Latino/*statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*complications/ethnology/*mortality/*physiopathology', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Risk Factors', 'Sepsis/ethnology/*etiology/*physiopathology', 'United States/ethnology', 'Whites/statistics & numerical data', 'Young Adult']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Hispanic ethnicity', '*infection', '*leukemia', '*social determinants']",2020/05/23 06:00,2021/03/23 06:00,['2020/05/23 06:00'],"['2020/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/23 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/23 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/1043454220919699 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pediatr Oncol Nurs. 2020 Nov/Dec;37(6):349-358. doi: 10.1177/1043454220919699.

While outcome disparities between pediatric vs. adult centers [locus of care (LOC)] have been demonstrated in other AYA cancers such as acute lymphoblastic leukemia, they have not been well studied in HL. We therefore compared population-based treatment patterns and outcomes in AYA HL by LOC. The IMPACT Cohort includes data on all Ontario, Canada AYA (15-21 years) diagnosed with HL between 1992 and 2012. Linkage to population-based health administrative data identified late effects. We examined LOC-based differences in treatment modalities, cumulative doses, event-free survival (EFS), overall survival (OS), and late effects. Among 954 AYA, 711 (74.5%) received therapy at adult centers. Pediatric center AYA experienced higher rates of radiation therapy but lower cumulative doses of doxorubicin and bleomycin. 10-year EFS did not differ between pediatric vs. adult cancer vs. community centers (83.8% +/- 2.4% vs. 82.8% +/- 1.6% vs. 82.7%+/-3.0%; P = .71); LOC was not significantly associated with either EFS or OS in multivariable analyses. Higher incidences of second malignancies in pediatric center AYA and of cardiovascular events in adult center AYA were observed, but were not significant. In conclusion, while pediatric and adult centers used different treatment strategies, outcomes were equivalent. Differences in treatment exposures are however likely to result in different late-effect risks. Protocol choice should be guided by individual late-effect risk.","['Gupta, Sumit', 'Baxter, Nancy N', 'Hodgson, David', 'Punnett, Angela', 'Sutradhar, Rinku', 'Pole, Jason D', 'Nagamuthu, Chenthila', 'Lau, Cindy', 'Nathan, Paul C']","['Gupta S', 'Baxter NN', 'Hodgson D', 'Punnett A', 'Sutradhar R', 'Pole JD', 'Nagamuthu C', 'Lau C', 'Nathan PC']","['Division of Haematology/Oncology, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Faculty of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Cancer Research Program, Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Institute for Health Policy, Evaluation and Management, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Cancer Research Program, Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Institute for Health Policy, Evaluation and Management, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Dalla Lana School of Public Health, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', ""Department of Surgery, Li Ka Shing Knowledge Institute, St. Michael's Hospital, Toronto, ON, Canada."", 'Faculty of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Institute for Health Policy, Evaluation and Management, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Pediatric Oncology Group of Ontario, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Division of Haematology/Oncology, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Faculty of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Institute for Health Policy, Evaluation and Management, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Cancer Research Program, Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Institute for Health Policy, Evaluation and Management, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Dalla Lana School of Public Health, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Dalla Lana School of Public Health, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Pediatric Oncology Group of Ontario, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Center for Health Services, The University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia.', 'Cancer Research Program, Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Cancer Research Program, Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Division of Haematology/Oncology, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Faculty of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Cancer Research Program, Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Institute for Health Policy, Evaluation and Management, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.']",['eng'],['CIHR/Canada'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200522,United States,Cancer Med,Cancer medicine,101595310,"['11056-06-7 (Bleomycin)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Factors', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Bleomycin/administration & dosage', 'Cancer Care Facilities/*trends', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Hodgkin Disease/mortality/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Ontario', 'Outcome and Process Assessment, Health Care/*trends', ""Practice Patterns, Physicians'/*trends"", 'Progression-Free Survival', 'Radiotherapy/trends', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Time Factors', 'Young Adult']",PMC7541154,['NOTNLM'],"['*Hodgkin lymphoma', '*adolescents and young adults', '*health Services Research', '*population-based', '*survival']",2020/05/23 06:00,2021/07/21 06:00,['2020/05/23 06:00'],"['2020/03/03 00:00 [received]', '2020/04/19 00:00 [revised]', '2020/04/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/21 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/23 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cam4.3138 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Med. 2020 Oct;9(19):6933-6945. doi: 10.1002/cam4.3138.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the real-life use of anagrelide in patients with ET followed over 25 years at the Haematological Institutes belonging to ""Ph1-negative Myeloproliferative Neoplasms Latium Group."" PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eligibility criteria were diagnosis of ET and treatment with anagrelide. Data were collected through an ad hoc case report form. RESULTS: One hundred and fifty patients received anagrelide for a median time of 7.4 years (0.1-23.2). Anagrelide was administered as first-line therapy in 34.7% of patients, as second-line in 52% and as third-line in 13.3%: 85.4% responded to therapy. Sixty-eight/136 evaluable patients reported side effects: palpitations, peripheral vasodilation, anaemia, diarrhoea and gastric distress. Fourteen thrombotic (arterial 10, venous 4) and 51 bleeding events (minor 48, major 3) occurred. Sixteen/150 (10.6%) patients developed secondary myelofibrosis and 3/150 (2%) an acute myeloid leukaemia. CONCLUSIONS: In our experience, anagrelide is an effective drug in reducing platelet levels in a high percentage of patients with ET. It is especially addressed to younger people. A careful assessment of the thrombotic risk and monitoring of cardiac function, at diagnosis and during follow-up, is mandatory.","['Mazzucconi, Maria Gabriella', 'Baldacci, Ermina', 'Latagliata, Roberto', 'Breccia, Massimo', 'Paoloni, Francesca', 'Di Veroli, Ambra', 'Cedrone, Michele', 'Anaclerico, Barbara', 'Villiva, Nicoletta', 'Porrini, Raffaele', 'Montefusco, Enrico', 'Andriani, Alessandro', 'Montanaro, Marco', 'Scaramucci, Laura', 'Spadea, Antonio', 'Rago, Angela', 'Cimino, Giuseppe', 'Spirito, Francesca', 'Santoro, Cristina']","['Mazzucconi MG', 'Baldacci E', 'Latagliata R', 'Breccia M', 'Paoloni F', 'Di Veroli A', 'Cedrone M', 'Anaclerico B', 'Villiva N', 'Porrini R', 'Montefusco E', 'Andriani A', 'Montanaro M', 'Scaramucci L', 'Spadea A', 'Rago A', 'Cimino G', 'Spirito F', 'Santoro C']","['Ematologia, Universita Sapienza, Roma, Italia.', 'Ematologia, Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Policlinico Umberto I, Roma, Italia.', 'Ematologia, Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Policlinico Umberto I, Roma, Italia.', 'Ematologia, Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Policlinico Umberto I, Roma, Italia.', 'Fondazione GIMEMA Franco Mandelli Onlus, Roma, Italia.', 'Ematologia, Ospedale Belcolle, Viterbo, Italia.', 'Ematologia, Ospedale San Giovanni, Roma, Italia.', 'Ematologia, Ospedale San Giovanni, Roma, Italia.', 'UOSD Ematologia, ASL Roma 1, Roma, Italia.', ""Ematologia, Ospedale Sant'Andrea, Roma, Italia."", ""Ematologia, Ospedale Sant'Andrea, Roma, Italia."", 'Ematologia, Ospedale Fabrizio Spaziani, Frosinone, Italia.', 'Ematologia, Ospedale Belcolle, Viterbo, Italia.', ""Ematologia, Ospedale Sant'Eugenio, Roma, Italia."", 'Unita di Ematologia e Trapianto di Midollo Osseo, Istituto Nazionale Tumori Regina Elena, Roma, Italia.', 'UOSD Ematologia, ASL Roma 1, Roma, Italia.', 'Ematologia, Ospedale Santa Maria Goretti, Latina, Italia.', 'Ematologia, Ospedale San Camillo, Roma, Italia.', 'Ematologia, Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Policlinico Umberto I, Roma, Italia.']",['eng'],['Takeda Pharmaceutical Company'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20200616,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Quinazolines)', 'K9X45X0051 (anagrelide)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Anemia/diagnosis/etiology', 'Disease Management', 'Disease Susceptibility', 'Drug Substitution', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Health Care Surveys', 'Humans', 'Italy/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications, Hematologic', 'Prognosis', 'Quinazolines/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Retreatment', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Thrombocythemia, Essential/diagnosis/*drug therapy/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Thrombosis', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",,['NOTNLM'],"['adverse events', 'anagrelide', 'essential thrombocythemia', 'haemorrhage', 'thrombosis']",2020/05/23 06:00,2021/06/17 06:00,['2020/05/23 06:00'],"['2020/03/18 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/13 00:00 [revised]', '2020/05/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/17 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/23 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ejh.13454 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2020 Sep;105(3):335-343. doi: 10.1111/ejh.13454.

Clinical and radiographic findings in this case were very similar to cases of MRONJ in patients receiving Sunitinib or other anti-angiogenetic substances, assuming that Bemcentinib may cause similar oral side effects. We present a male 81-year-old patient with a manifestation of alveolar bone necrosis at the central upper incisors following a 2-month regimen with the AXL-inhibitor Bemcentinib, administered for the treatment of secondary acute myeloblastic leukemia (sAML). Due to the duration of less than 8 weeks, the osteonecrosis was diagnosed as necrotizing periodontitis, but the intraoral clinical and radiographic findings were also compatible with the differential diagnosis of medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ, stage II). Following to discontinuation of Bemcentinib, the affected bone was surgically revised including the removal of a demarcated bone sequester under preventive antibiotic treatment (metronidazole 400 mg t.i.d.). We hypothesize that Bemcentinib might increase the susceptibility for osteonecrosis of the jaw, probably related to its antiangiogenic effects and the resulting modulation of host immune response. Based on the current observations, it can be assumed that oro-dental health might be significant also prior and during treatment with Bemcentinib for the prevention of MRONJ.","['Bumm, Caspar V', 'Folwaczny, Matthias', 'Wolfle, Uta C']","['Bumm CV', 'Folwaczny M', 'Wolfle UC']","['Department of Conservative Dentistry and Periodontology, University Hospital, LMU, Goethestrasse 70, 80336, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Conservative Dentistry and Periodontology, University Hospital, LMU, Goethestrasse 70, 80336, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Conservative Dentistry and Periodontology, University Hospital, LMU, Goethestrasse 70, 80336, Munich, Germany. uta.woelfle@med.uni-muenchen.de.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20200521,Germany,Oral Maxillofac Surg,Oral and maxillofacial surgery,101319632,"['0 (Angiogenesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Bone Density Conservation Agents)', '0 (Diphosphonates)']",IM,"['Aged, 80 and over', 'Angiogenesis Inhibitors', '*Bisphosphonate-Associated Osteonecrosis of the Jaw', '*Bone Density Conservation Agents', 'Diphosphonates', 'Humans', 'Male', '*Osteonecrosis', '*Periodontitis']",PMC7413899,['NOTNLM'],"['AXL inhibitor', 'Acute myeloblastic leukemia', 'Bemcentinib', 'MRONJ', 'Medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw', 'Necrotizing periodontitis']",2020/05/23 06:00,2020/08/12 06:00,['2020/05/23 06:00'],"['2020/03/03 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/12 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/23 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s10006-020-00851-w [doi]', '10.1007/s10006-020-00851-w [pii]']",ppublish,Oral Maxillofac Surg. 2020 Sep;24(3):353-358. doi: 10.1007/s10006-020-00851-w.

However, few studies have prospectively evaluated the treatment outcomes and diagnostic performance of HLH criteria in adult patients with secondary HLH. Thus, we performed a single-center, prospective cohort study of adult patients with suspected HLH, and we analyzed treatment outcomes of patients enrolled between 2017 and 2019 as an interim analysis ( ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03117010). Of the 73 patients with suspected HLH, 70 patients completed the evaluation for >/= 7 of the HLH-2004 criteria, and 55 patients were diagnosed with HLH (55/73, 75%). Although serum ferritin and fever had a sensitivity of more than 90%, both had exceptionally low specificity, whereas soluble CD25 had a sensitivity of more than 90% and specificity of 80%. Forty patients with malignancy-associated HLH had B cell (n = 19) or T- or NK-cell (n = 21) lymphoid malignancy, whereas 15 patients had non-malignant disorders. Non-malignancy-associated HLH had greater than 90% 1-year overall survival (OS) after diagnosis of HLH, whereas that for malignancy-associated HLH was less than 40%. In conclusion, our study showed promising treatment outcomes for patients enrolled in our prospective cohort study, and prospectively demonstrated the diagnostic performance of the HLH-2004 criteria in adult patients with suspected HLH.

T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is a malignancy accompanied with genetic aberrations and accounts for 20% of children's and adult's ALL. Notch signaling pathway dysregulation occurs in 60% of T-ALL cases. In the present study, we aimed to determine the relationship between miRNAs and genes involved in Notch signaling pathway. Materials and Methods: Considering the role of the pathway and its down-stream genes in proliferation, differentiation, cell cycle, and apoptosis, NOTCH1, c-Myc, and CCND1 genes were selected as target genes. Using bioinformatics studies, miR-34a, miR-449a, miR-1827, and miR-106b were selected as miRNAs targeting the above-mentioned genes. We evaluated these genes and miRNAs in T-ALL clinical samples as well as Jurkat cell line, in which NOTCH1 is overexpressed. Results: Quantitative Real-Time PCR indicated that NOTCH1, c-Myc, and CCND1 were overexpressed in samples with decreased expression of miR-34a. In addition, we observed that samples with decreased expression of miR-449a showed increased expression of NOTCH1 and CCND1. Furthermore, we analyzed the expression of miR-1827 and miR-106b, which target c-Myc and CCND1, respectively. We found out that the expression of miR-1827, miR-106b, and their respective target genes were inversely correlated in 80% and 75% of the cases (r=0.8), respectively. Furthermore, in Jurkat cell line, the expression of target genes was increased while the candidate miRNAs except miR-34a were decreased. Conclusion: These miRNAs can be proposed as biomarkers and new therapeutic targets in T-ALL patients who have NOTCH1 overexpression.","['Naderi, Tohid', 'Mohammadi-Yeganeh, Samira', 'Mohammadi-Hezaveh, Neda', 'Hadavi, Razie', 'Gharehbaghian, Ahmad', 'Vazifeh-Shiran, Nader', 'Fallah Azad, Vahid', 'Paryan, Mahdi']","['Naderi T', 'Mohammadi-Yeganeh S', 'Mohammadi-Hezaveh N', 'Hadavi R', 'Gharehbaghian A', 'Vazifeh-Shiran N', 'Fallah Azad V', 'Paryan M']","['Department of Laboratory Hematology and Blood Bank, School of Allied Medicine, Shahid Beheshti University of medical sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Medical Nanotechnology Research Center, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Biotechnology, School of Advanced Technologies in Medicine, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Laboratory Hematology and Blood Bank, School of Allied Medicine, Shahid Beheshti University of medical sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Semnan University of Medical Sciences, Semnan, Iran.', 'Cellular and Molecular Biology Research Center, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Laboratory Hematology and Blood Bank, School of Allied Medicine, Shahid Beheshti University of medical sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Laboratory Hematology and Blood Bank, School of Allied Medicine, Shahid Beheshti University of medical sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Mahak Charity Hospital, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Research and Development, Production and Research Complex, Pasteur Institute of Iran, Tehran, Iran.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Iran,Iran J Basic Med Sci,Iranian journal of basic medical sciences,101517966,,,,PMC7229500,['NOTNLM'],"['Bioinformatics', 'Biomarker', 'Notch signaling pathway T-cell acute lymphoblastic', 'leukemia', 'miRNA']",2020/05/23 06:00,2020/05/23 06:01,['2020/05/23 06:00'],"['2020/05/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/23 06:01 [medline]']",['10.22038/IJBMS.2019.40695.9615 [doi]'],ppublish,Iran J Basic Med Sci. 2020 Mar;23(3):376-382. doi: 10.22038/IJBMS.2019.40695.9615.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The identification of the BCR-ABL1 transcript was of critical importance for both CML diagnosis and minimal residual disease (MRD) monitoring. In this review, we report the recent advances in the CML MRD monitoring based on RNA, DNA and protein analysis. The detection of the BCR-ABL1 transcript by the quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction is the gold standard method, but other systems based on digital PCR or on GeneXpert technology have been developed. In the last years, DNA-based assays showed high sensitivity and specificity, and flow cytometric approaches for the detection of the BCR-ABL1 fusion protein have also been tested. Recently, new MRD monitoring systems based on the detection of molecular markers other than the BCR-ABL1 fusion were proposed. These approaches, such as the identification of CD26+ leukemic stem cells, microRNAs and mitochondrial DNA mutations, just remain preliminary and need to be implemented. In the precision medicine era, the constant improvement of the CML MRD monitoring practice could allow clinicians to choose the best therapeutic algorithm and a more accurate selection of CML patients eligible for the tyrosine kinase inhibitors discontinuation.","['Cumbo, Cosimo', 'Anelli, Luisa', 'Specchia, Giorgina', 'Albano, Francesco']","['Cumbo C', 'Anelli L', 'Specchia G', 'Albano F']","['Department of Emergency and Organ Transplantation (D.E.T.O.), Hematology Section, University of Bari, Bari 70124, Italy.', 'Department of Emergency and Organ Transplantation (D.E.T.O.), Hematology Section, University of Bari, Bari 70124, Italy.', 'Department of Emergency and Organ Transplantation (D.E.T.O.), Hematology Section, University of Bari, Bari 70124, Italy.', 'Department of Emergency and Organ Transplantation (D.E.T.O.), Hematology Section, University of Bari, Bari 70124, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200506,New Zealand,Cancer Manag Res,Cancer management and research,101512700,,,,PMC7211966,['NOTNLM'],"['MRD monitoring', 'chronic myeloid leukemia', 'minimal residual disease']",2020/05/23 06:00,2020/05/23 06:01,['2020/05/23 06:00'],"['2020/03/05 00:00 [received]', '2020/04/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/23 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/CMAR.S232752 [doi]', '232752 [pii]']",epublish,Cancer Manag Res. 2020 May 6;12:3175-3189. doi: 10.2147/CMAR.S232752. eCollection 2020.,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-2509-6200', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9185-724X', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7926-6052']",['The authors declare no competing interests.'],['(c) 2020 Cumbo et al.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As the survival rate of OSCC patients is low, it is crucial to explore new markers and therapeutic targets for early diagnosis of the disease. A high level of actinin alpha 1 (ACTN1) in patients could serve as an independent prognostic factor of acute myeloid leukemia. However, the role of ACTN1 in OSCC remains unclear. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the role of ACTN1 in OSCC. Methods: ACTN1 protein levels in tissues were determined by immunohistochemical (IHC) staining. The correlation of ACTN1 expression with clinicopathological features and prognosis was analyzed. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed. The effect of ACTN1 knockdown on cell proliferation, migration, invasion, apoptosis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and the cell cycle was evaluated using Western blotting, Cell Counting Kit8 (CCK8) assays, flow cytometry analysis, transwell assays, wound-healing assays, and nude mouse models of subcutaneous xenograft and pulmonary metastasis. Results: Based on the total score of ACTN1 IHC staining analysis, ACTN1 expression was found to be low in 10 normal mucosal tissues, 48 normal mucosal tissues adjacent to OSCC, and 19 OSCC tissues, but high in 29 OSCC tissues. ACTN1 protein levels were significantly associated with the clinical stage and node metastasis, and a high ACTN1 protein level indicated poor prognosis. Moreover, ACTN1 expression was an independent predictor of poor prognosis of OSCC. Using in vitro assays, we found that ACTN1 knockdown could induce cell cycle arrest, promote apoptosis, and inhibit EMT and cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in the OSCC cell lines, SCC-15 and HSC-3. Moreover, ACTN1 knockdown inhibited subcutaneous tumor growth and pulmonary metastasis in vivo. Conclusion: ACTN1 levels were significantly associated with the clinical stage and node metastasis, and a high ACTN1 protein level indicated poor prognosis. Moreover, ACTN1 knockdown could suppress cell proliferation and metastasis of OSCC. Our results suggested that ACTN1 may serve as a diagnostic and prognostic marker of OSCC.","['Xie, Guo-Feng', 'Zhao, Luo-Dan', 'Chen, Qiang', 'Tang, Dong-Xiao', 'Chen, Qiong-Yu', 'Lu, Hong-Fei', 'Cai, Jia-Rong', 'Chen, Zheng']","['Xie GF', 'Zhao LD', 'Chen Q', 'Tang DX', 'Chen QY', 'Lu HF', 'Cai JR', 'Chen Z']","[""Department of Radiation Oncology, Affiliated Cancer Hospital & Institute of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong Province 510095, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, People's Republic of China."", ""Key Laboratory of Malignant Tumor Gene Regulation and Target Therapy of Guangzhou Higher Education Institutes, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Stomatology, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou 510630, Guangdong Province, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Stomatology, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou 510630, Guangdong Province, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Stomatology, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou 510630, Guangdong Province, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Stomatology, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou 510630, Guangdong Province, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Urology, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou 510630, Guangdong Province, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Stomatology, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou 510630, Guangdong Province, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200505,New Zealand,Drug Des Devel Ther,"Drug design, development and therapy",101475745,"['0 (ACTN1 protein, human)', '11003-00-2 (Actinin)']",IM,"['Actinin/analysis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Female', '*Gene Silencing', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mouth Neoplasms/*diagnosis/*metabolism/pathology', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Prognosis', 'Squamous Cell Carcinoma of Head and Neck/*diagnosis/*metabolism/pathology', 'Young Adult']",PMC7211328,['NOTNLM'],"['actinin alpha 1', 'knockdown', 'metastasis', 'oral squamous cell carcinoma', 'poor prognosis', 'proliferation']",2020/05/23 06:00,2021/03/16 06:00,['2020/05/23 06:00'],"['2020/01/02 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/16 06:00 [medline]']","['10.2147/DDDT.S244516 [doi]', '244516 [pii]']",epublish,Drug Des Devel Ther. 2020 May 5;14:1717-1727. doi: 10.2147/DDDT.S244516. eCollection 2020.,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-5508-2144', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3468-109X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2190-6405', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0208-7942']","['We wish to confirm that there are no known conflicts of interest associated with', 'this publication and no significant financial support that could have influenced', 'the work and its outcome was extended.']",['(c) 2020 Xie et al.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Among patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (n = 314), there were no differences in overall survival (OS) by conditioning regimen. Among patients with malignant lymphoma (ML) (n = 465), FM-TBI and FC-TBI regimens had similar OS, whereas FB-based regimen had lower OS (hazard ratio [HR], 1.73; P < 0.01) than did FM-TBI regimen due to higher non-relapse mortality (HR, 1.72; P = 0.02). In addition, mycophenolate mofetil-containing GVHD prophylaxis was associated with better OS than methotrexate-containing GVHD prophylaxis among patients who received FM-TBI (HR, 0.65; P = 0.03) and FC-TBI (HR, 0.25; P < 0.01) regimens due to a decreased relapse risk.

Concerns that it may trigger chromosome aberrations similar to those observed in leukaemia patients were refuted but long-term effects of G-CSF mobilisation on genome integrity remains unclear. In the setting of a multi-centre clinical trial we screened blood samples from 50 PBSC donors at cellular and gene level for aberrations common in haematological malignancies using fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) and next generation sequencing (NGS) assays. Analysis of samples collected before, on the day of donation, 90 and 180 days after G-CSF admission confirmed the absence of short-term effects in PBSC donors on both quiescent and dividing cells. This data did not differ from the results of 50 individuals tested 3-5 years after bone marrow donation and 50 healthy persons. NGS using a panel targeting 54 genes recurrently affected in myeloid disorders (TruSight Myeloid panel, Illumina) showed that the gene profiles of samples from 48 PBSC donors remained stable throughout the study period. These data strongly indicate absence of detrimental effects on the genome integrity caused by PBSC donation.","['Nacheva, E', 'Ahyee, T', 'Addada, J', 'Navarette, C', 'Pamphilon, D', 'Regan, F', 'Pawson, R', 'Szydlo, R', 'Goldman, J', 'Mackinnon, S', 'Shaw, B E', 'Madrigal, A']","['Nacheva E', 'Ahyee T', 'Addada J', 'Navarette C', 'Pamphilon D', 'Regan F', 'Pawson R', 'Szydlo R', 'Goldman J', 'Mackinnon S', 'Shaw BE', 'Madrigal A']","['UCL Cancer Institute, London, UK. elisabeth.nacheva@hslpathology.com.', 'HSL Analytical LLP, OncoGenomics, Halo Building, Level 6, 1 Mabledon Place, London, WC1H 9AX, UK. elisabeth.nacheva@hslpathology.com.', 'Anthony Nolan Research Institute, The Royal Free Hospital, Pond Street, London, NW3 2QG, UK.', 'Anthony Nolan Research Institute, The Royal Free Hospital, Pond Street, London, NW3 2QG, UK.', 'NHSBT British Bone Marrow Register (BBMR) and NHS Cord Blood Bank, Charcot Road, Colindale, London, NW9 5BG, UK.', 'NHSBT British Bone Marrow Register (BBMR) and NHS Cord Blood Bank, Charcot Road, Colindale, London, NW9 5BG, UK.', 'NHSBT British Bone Marrow Register (BBMR) and NHS Cord Blood Bank, Charcot Road, Colindale, London, NW9 5BG, UK.', 'NHSBT British Bone Marrow Register (BBMR) and NHS Cord Blood Bank, Charcot Road, Colindale, London, NW9 5BG, UK.', 'Centre for Haematology, Faculty of Medicine, BC2, Hammersmith Hospital, Imperial College Hammersmith Campus, London, UK.', 'Centre for Haematology, Faculty of Medicine, BC2, Hammersmith Hospital, Imperial College Hammersmith Campus, London, UK.', 'UCL Cancer Institute, London, UK.', 'Anthony Nolan Research Institute, The Royal Free Hospital, Pond Street, London, NW3 2QG, UK.', 'Centre for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research, Milwaukee, WI, USA.', 'Anthony Nolan Research Institute, The Royal Free Hospital, Pond Street, London, NW3 2QG, UK.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200521,England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,['143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)'],IM,"['Bone Marrow', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization', 'Humans', '*Peripheral Blood Stem Cells', 'Tissue and Organ Harvesting', '*Unrelated Donors']",,,,2020/05/23 06:00,2021/06/22 06:00,['2020/05/23 06:00'],"['2020/01/23 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/04/06 00:00 [revised]', '2020/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/22 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/23 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41409-020-0945-y [doi]', '10.1038/s41409-020-0945-y [pii]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2020 Jul;55(7):1290-1296. doi: 10.1038/s41409-020-0945-y.

The mechanisms are not fully understood. The enteroendocrine signalling compound, serotonin (5-HT), is important for regulating peristaltic motion, fluid secretion and visceral hypersensitivity in the GI tract, and has been implicated in diseases such as irritable bowel syndrome. In this study, we have evaluated whether TKI-induced diarrhoea may be related to variation in the serotonin re-uptake transporter (SERT) gene. CML patients with and without diarrhoea on the SPIRIT2 trial (imatinib, n = 319; and dasatinib, n = 297) were genotyped for the promoter 5-HTTLPR, intron 2 VNTR and rs25531 polymorphisms by PCR-based methods. Diarrhoea was more prevalent in imatinib, than in dasatinib treated patients (P = 0.015), which when stratified by gender was seen to be driven by female patients (P = 0.036). Logistic regression analysis revealed that age, and the dominant HTTLPR with the rs25531 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) model, explained the occurrence of diarrhoea in ~10% of imatinib-treated female CML patients. These data suggest SERT polymorphisms influence imatinib-induced diarrhoea but not that of dasatinib.","['Davies, Andrea', 'Rodriguez-Vicente, Ana Eugenia', 'Austin, Gemma', 'Loaiza, Sandra', 'Foroni, Letizia', 'Clark, Richard E', 'Pirmohamed, Munir']","['Davies A', 'Rodriguez-Vicente AE', 'Austin G', 'Loaiza S', 'Foroni L', 'Clark RE', 'Pirmohamed M']","['The Wolfson Centre for Personalised Medicine, The MRC Centre for Drug Safety Science, Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, UK. andrea.davies@liverpool.ac.uk.', 'The Wolfson Centre for Personalised Medicine, The MRC Centre for Drug Safety Science, Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, UK.', 'IBMCC-Cancer Research Center, University of Salamanca, and Hematology Department, Hospital Universitario Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Molecular and Clinical Cancer Medicine, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, UK.', 'Department of Haematology, Hammersmith Hospital, Imperial College London, London, UK.', 'Department of Haematology, Hammersmith Hospital, Imperial College London, London, UK.', 'Molecular and Clinical Cancer Medicine, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, UK.', 'The Wolfson Centre for Personalised Medicine, The MRC Centre for Drug Safety Science, Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, UK.']",['eng'],['MR/L006758/1/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom'],"['Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200521,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (SLC6A4 protein, human)', '0 (Serotonin Plasma Membrane Transport Proteins)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Dasatinib/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Diarrhea/*chemically induced/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Frequency', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Minisatellite Repeats', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Serotonin Plasma Membrane Transport Proteins/*genetics', 'Young Adult']",PMC7242433,,,2020/05/23 06:00,2021/01/15 06:00,['2020/05/23 06:00'],"['2019/09/15 00:00 [received]', '2020/04/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-020-65350-0 [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-020-65350-0 [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2020 May 21;10(1):8394. doi: 10.1038/s41598-020-65350-0.,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5445-8525'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mutations within BCR-ABL1, the oncogene giving rise to chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), lead to resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), and some are associated with clinically more aggressive disease and worse outcome. Using the retroviral transduction/transplantation model of CML and human cell lines we faithfully recapitulate accelerated disease course in TKI resistance. We show in various models, that murine and human imatinib-resistant leukemia cells positive for the oncogene BCR-ABL1(T315I) differ from BCR-ABL1 native (BCR-ABL1) cells with regards to niche location and specific niche interactions. We implicate a pathway via integrin beta3, integrin-linked kinase (ILK) and its role in deposition of the extracellular matrix (ECM) protein fibronectin as causative of these differences. We demonstrate a trend towards a reduced BCR-ABL1(T315I+) tumor burden and significantly prolonged survival of mice with BCR-ABL1(T315I+) CML treated with fibronectin or an ILK inhibitor in xenogeneic and syngeneic murine transplantation models, respectively. These data suggest that interactions with ECM proteins via the integrin beta3/ILK-mediated signaling pathway in BCR-ABL1(T315I+) cells differentially and specifically influence leukemia progression. Niche targeting via modulation of the ECM may be a feasible therapeutic approach to consider in this setting.","['Kumar, Rahul', 'Pereira, Raquel S', 'Zanetti, Costanza', 'Minciacchi, Valentina R', 'Merten, Maximilian', 'Meister, Melanie', 'Niemann, Julian', 'Dietz, Marina S', 'Russel, Nina', 'Schnutgen, Frank', 'Tamai, Minori', 'Akahane, Koshi', 'Inukai, Takeshi', 'Oellerich, Thomas', 'Kvasnicka, Hans Michael', 'Pfeifer, Heike', 'Nicolini, Franck E', 'Heilemann, Mike', 'Van Etten, Richard A', 'Krause, Daniela S']","['Kumar R', 'Pereira RS', 'Zanetti C', 'Minciacchi VR', 'Merten M', 'Meister M', 'Niemann J', 'Dietz MS', 'Russel N', 'Schnutgen F', 'Tamai M', 'Akahane K', 'Inukai T', 'Oellerich T', 'Kvasnicka HM', 'Pfeifer H', 'Nicolini FE', 'Heilemann M', 'Van Etten RA', 'Krause DS']","['Georg-Speyer-Haus, Institute for Tumor Biology and Experimental Therapy, 60596, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Georg-Speyer-Haus, Institute for Tumor Biology and Experimental Therapy, 60596, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Georg-Speyer-Haus, Institute for Tumor Biology and Experimental Therapy, 60596, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Georg-Speyer-Haus, Institute for Tumor Biology and Experimental Therapy, 60596, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Georg-Speyer-Haus, Institute for Tumor Biology and Experimental Therapy, 60596, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Georg-Speyer-Haus, Institute for Tumor Biology and Experimental Therapy, 60596, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Georg-Speyer-Haus, Institute for Tumor Biology and Experimental Therapy, 60596, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Institute for Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Goethe-University Frankfurt, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Georg-Speyer-Haus, Institute for Tumor Biology and Experimental Therapy, 60596, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology/Oncology, Goethe University, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Frankfurt Cancer Institute (FCI), Goethe University, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatrics, School of Medicine, University of Yamanashi, Chuo, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, School of Medicine, University of Yamanashi, Chuo, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, School of Medicine, University of Yamanashi, Chuo, Japan.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology/Oncology, Goethe University, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Frankfurt Cancer Institute (FCI), Goethe University, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Senckenberg Institute of Pathology, Goethe University Frankfurt, 60590, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology/Oncology, Goethe University, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and INSERM U 1052, CRCL, Centre Leon Berard, 69373, Lyon Cedex, France.', 'Institute for Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Goethe-University Frankfurt, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Chao Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of California, Irvine, CA, 92697, USA.', 'Georg-Speyer-Haus, Institute for Tumor Biology and Experimental Therapy, 60596, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.

A classic example is the fusion of the BCR activator of RhoGEF and GTPase and the ABL proto-oncogene nonreceptor tyrosine kinase, a result of a chromosome abnormality (Philadelphia chromosome) that causes leukemia. To unravel the mechanism underlying BCR-ABL-mediated tumorigenesis, here we compared the stability of ABL and the BCR-ABL fusion. Using protein degradation, cell proliferation, 5-ethynyl-2-deoxyuridine, and apoptosis assays, along with xenograft tumor analysis, we found that the N-terminal segment of ABL, which is lost in the BCR-ABL fusion, confers degradation capacity that is promoted by SMAD-specific E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 1. We further demonstrate that the N-terminal deletion renders ABL more stable and stimulates cell growth and tumorigenesis. The findings of our study suggest that altered protein stability may contribute to chromosome translocation-induced cancer development.","['Yan, Zhengwei', 'Shanmugasundaram, Karthigayan', 'Ma, Dongwen', 'Luo, Jiayu', 'Luo, Shiwen', 'Rao, Hai']","['Yan Z', 'Shanmugasundaram K', 'Ma D', 'Luo J', 'Luo S', 'Rao H']","['Center for Experimental Medicine, First Affiliated Hospital, Nanchang University, Nanchang, China.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio, Texas, USA.', 'Center for Experimental Medicine, First Affiliated Hospital, Nanchang University, Nanchang, China.', 'Center for Experimental Medicine, First Affiliated Hospital, Nanchang University, Nanchang, China.', 'Center for Experimental Medicine, First Affiliated Hospital, Nanchang University, Nanchang, China.

It has been shown that antitumor efficacy of anti-CD38-Mab depends on the level of CD38 expression on tumor cells. Reports on CD38 expression in T-ALL are scarce, and data on the effect of cytotoxic chemotherapy on CD38 expression are limited to very few samples. Moreover, it lacks entirely in refractory disease and in adult T-ALL. We report the flow cytometric evaluation of CD38 expression in T-ALL blasts at diagnosis and the effect of cytotoxic chemotherapy on its expression in measurable residual disease (MRD), refractory disease (MRD>/=5%), and relapsed disease in a large cohort of T-ALL. METHODS: The study included 347 samples (188 diagnostic, 100 MRD, 24 refractory and 35 relapse samples) from 196 (children: 85; adolescents/adults: 111) patients with T-ALL. CD38-positive blasts percentages (CD38-PBPs) and expression-intensity (mean fluorescent intensity, CD38-MFI) were studied using multicolor flow cytometry (MFC). MFC-based MRD was performed at the end-of-induction (EOI-MRD, day 30-35) and end-of-consolidation (EOC-MRD, day 78-85) subsequent follow-up (SFU-MRD) points. RESULTS: Patients were classified into early thymic precursor subtype of T-ALL (ETPALL, 54/188, 28.7%), and non-ETPALL (134/188, 71.3%). Of 188, EOI-MRD assessment was available in 152, EOC-MRD was available in 96 and SFU-MRD was available in 14 patients. CD38 was found positive in 97.9% (184/188) of diagnostic, 88.7% (110/124) MRD (including 24-refractory) and 82.9% (29/35) relapsed samples. Median (95% CI) of CD38-PBPs/MFI in diagnostic, MRD, refractory, and relapsed T-ALL samples were, respectively, 85.9% (82.10%-89.91%)/4.2 (3.88-4.47), 74.0% (58.87%-83.88%)/4.6 (3.67-6.81), 79.6% (65.25%-96.11%)/4.6 (3.33-8.47) and 85.2% (74.48%-93.01%)/5.6 (4.14-8.99). No significant difference was noted in CD38 expression between pediatric versus adult and patients with ETPALL versus non-ETPALL. No change was observed in CD38-MFI between diagnostic versus MRD and diagnostic versus relapsed paired samples. However, we noticed a mild drop in the CD38-PBPs in MRD samples compared with the diagnostic samples (p=0.016). CONCLUSION: We report an in-depth analysis of CD38 expression in a large cohort of T-ALL at diagnosis, during chemotherapy, and at relapse. Our data demonstrated that CD38 is robustly expressed in T-ALL blasts with a little effect of cytotoxic chemotherapy making it a potentially effective target for antiCD38-Mab therapy.","['Tembhare, Prashant Ramesh', 'Sriram, Harshini', 'Khanka, Twinkle', 'Chatterjee, Gaurav', 'Panda, Devasis', 'Ghogale, Sitaram', 'Badrinath, Yajamanam', 'Deshpande, Nilesh', 'Patkar, Nikhil V', 'Narula, Gaurav', 'Bagal, Bhausaheb', 'Jain, Hasmukh', 'Sengar, Manju', 'Khattry, Navin', 'Banavali, Shripad', 'Gujral, Sumeet', 'Subramanian, Papagudi G']","['Tembhare PR', 'Sriram H', 'Khanka T', 'Chatterjee G', 'Panda D', 'Ghogale S', 'Badrinath Y', 'Deshpande N', 'Patkar NV', 'Narula G', 'Bagal B', 'Jain H', 'Sengar M', 'Khattry N', 'Banavali S', 'Gujral S', 'Subramanian PG']","['Hematopathology Laboratory, Tata Memorial Centre, Navi Mumbai, Maharashtra, India docprt@gmail.com.', 'Homi Bhabha National Institute, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.', 'Hematopathology Laboratory, Tata Memorial Centre, Navi Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.', 'Homi Bhabha National Institute, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.', 'Hematopathology Laboratory, Tata Memorial Centre, Navi Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.', 'Homi Bhabha National Institute, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.', 'Hematopathology Laboratory, Tata Memorial Centre, Navi Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.', 'Homi Bhabha National Institute, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.', 'Hematopathology Laboratory, Tata Memorial Centre, Navi Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.', 'Homi Bhabha National Institute, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.', 'Hematopathology Laboratory, Tata Memorial Centre, Navi Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.', 'Homi Bhabha National Institute, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.', 'Hematopathology Laboratory, Tata Memorial Centre, Navi Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.', 'Homi Bhabha National Institute, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.', 'Hematopathology Laboratory, Tata Memorial Centre, Navi Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.', 'Homi Bhabha National Institute, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.', 'Hematopathology Laboratory, Tata Memorial Centre, Navi Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.', 'Homi Bhabha National Institute, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.', 'Homi Bhabha National Institute, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Tata Memorial Hospital, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.', 'Homi Bhabha National Institute, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Tata Memorial Center, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.', 'Homi Bhabha National Institute, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Tata Memorial Center, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.', 'Homi Bhabha National Institute, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Tata Memorial Center, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.', 'Homi Bhabha National Institute, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Tata Memorial Center, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.', 'Homi Bhabha National Institute, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Tata Memorial Hospital, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.', 'Hematopathology Laboratory, Tata Memorial Centre, Navi Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.', 'Homi Bhabha National Institute, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.', 'Hematopathology Laboratory, Tata Memorial Centre, Navi Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.', 'Homi Bhabha National Institute, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,England,J Immunother Cancer,Journal for immunotherapy of cancer,101620585,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (CD38 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/*metabolism', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*metabolism', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Neoplasm, Residual/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Rate', 'Young Adult']",PMC7247386,['NOTNLM'],"['*antigens, neoplasm', '*hematologic neoplasms', '*immunotherapy', '*receptors, antigen', '*translational medical research']",2020/05/23 06:00,2021/03/18 06:00,['2020/05/23 06:00'],"['2020/04/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/18 06:00 [medline]']","['jitc-2020-000630 [pii]', '10.1136/jitc-2020-000630 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunother Cancer. 2020 May;8(1). pii: jitc-2020-000630. doi: 10.1136/jitc-2020-000630.,['ORCID: 0000-0002-9030-0415'],"['Competing interests: No, there are no competing interests.']","['(c) Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

Clinical features are dominated by cytopenia and a substantial risk for progression to acute myeloid leukemia. According to the World Health Organization, MDS is defined by cytopenia, bone marrow dysplasia and certain karyotypic abnormalities. The understanding of disease pathogenesis has undergone major development with the implementation of next-generation sequencing and a closer integration of morphology, cytogenetics and molecular genetics is currently paving the way for improved classification and prognostication. True precision medicine is still in the future for MDS and the development of novel therapeutic compounds with a propensity to markedly change patients' outcome lags behind that for many other blood cancers. Treatment of higher-risk MDS is dominated by monotherapy with hypomethylating agents but novel combinations are currently being evaluated in clinical trials. Agents that stimulate erythropoiesis continue to be first-line treatment for the anemia of lower-risk MDS but luspatercept has shown promise as second-line therapy for sideroblastic MDS and lenalidomide is an established second-line treatment for del(5q) lower-risk MDS. The only potentially curative option for MDS is hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, until recently associated with a relatively high risk of transplant-related mortality and relapse. However, recent studies show increased cure rates due to better tools to target the malignant clone with less toxicity. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the current status of the clinical evaluation, biology and therapeutic interventions for this spectrum of disorders.","['Hellstrom-Lindberg, Eva', 'Tobiasson, Magnus', 'Greenberg, Peter']","['Hellstrom-Lindberg E', 'Tobiasson M', 'Greenberg P']","['Karolinska Institutet, Center for Hematology and Regenerative Medicine, Department of Medicine Huddinge, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Karolinska Institutet, Center for Hematology and Regenerative Medicine, Department of Medicine Huddinge, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden magnus.tobiasson@ki.se.', 'Stanford Cancer Institute, Division of Hematology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200521,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,['F0P408N6V4 (Lenalidomide)'],IM,"['*Anemia', 'Erythropoiesis', 'Humans', 'Lenalidomide', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', '*Myelodysplastic Syndromes/diagnosis/drug therapy/genetics']",PMC7327628,,,2020/05/23 06:00,2021/04/28 06:00,['2020/05/23 06:00'],"['2020/03/23 00:00 [received]', '2020/04/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/28 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/23 06:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.2020.248955 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2020.248955 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2020 Jul;105(7):1765-1779. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2020.248955.

This study aimed to define characteristics and outcomes of patients with JAK2 V617F VAF < 2% compared to patients with VAF 2%-10%. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We included 5079 patients with JAK2 V617F tested during 2010-2015 and identified 216 patients (4.3%) with JAK2 V617F VAF < 10%. Twenty-seven patients were excluded because of missing follow-up data. RESULTS: A total of 189 patients were included for final analysis (89 patients with VAF < 2% and 100 patients with VAF 2%-10%). Patients with JAK2 V617F 2%-10% VAF had a significantly higher rate of splenomegaly, higher platelet counts, and more MPN diagnoses than the group with VAF < 2%. Ten patients (10.0%) with VAF 2%-10% and 24 patients (27.0%) with VAF < 2% had normal blood count and no thrombosis. There were no differences between the groups in all outcomes, including thrombotic complications (18.0% in both groups), progression to hematologic or solid cancers, and death. Patients without hematologic diagnosis had similar thrombotic incidence (16.7% in VAF < 2% vs. 20.0% in VAF 2%-10%). CONCLUSION: Patients with JAK2 V617F mutation VAF < 2% have similar survival and thrombotic incidence as patients with VAF 2%-10%. Patients with low VAF should be monitored in the same manner as patients with higher VAF with the same diagnoses to prevent morbidity and mortality. Patients without hematologic diagnosis may benefit from thrombotic risk reduction strategies such as optimization of cardiovascular risk factors.","['Limvorapitak, Wasithep', 'Parker, Jeremy', 'Hughesman, Curtis', 'McNeil, Kelly', 'Foltz, Lynda', 'Karsan, Aly']","['Limvorapitak W', 'Parker J', 'Hughesman C', 'McNeil K', 'Foltz L', 'Karsan A']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Thammasat University, Pathumthani, Thailand; The Leukemia/Bone Marrow Transplant Program of BC, BC Cancer, Vancouver, BC, Canada.

The overall incidence of LC is rare. We aimed to investigate the association between clinical characteristics, classifications and prognosis among different types of LC in Taiwan. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of forty-two patients with histopathology proven LC based on skin biopsies in a medical center in Southern Taiwan from 1997 to 2018. The study involved medical records of the patients, clinical manifestations, and outcomes according to different types of leukemia. RESULTS: This series consisted of 27 males and 15 females, and the mean age was 55.7 years old. The most common cutaneous features were papules (38%) and nodules (29%), followed by plaques (16%) and ulcers (10%). The most commonly affected sites were the trunk (33%) and extremities (31.5%), although generalized distribution (14%) was not rare. The prognosis of LC was very poor, 76.2% of patients (32/42) died during the follow-up, and the median survival time was 7.2 months (95% CI, 4.53-9.87 months). No statistical significance was found (P = 0.068 for survival curves) among different types of LC. CONCLUSION: This study was the first large-scale research in regarding to LC of Han Chinese. The commonest clinical presentations were papules and nodules, and the predilection sites were trunk and extremities. Besides, there was the high frequency of LC from AML and MDS in Taiwan. Clinicians should pay more attention to the leukemia patients with extramedullary manifestations due to poor survival outcomes.","['Chang, Yung-Wei', 'Lee, Chih-Hung', 'Tseng, Han-Chi']","['Chang YW', 'Lee CH', 'Tseng HC']","['Department of Dermatology, Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.', 'Department of Dermatology, Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.', 'Department of Dermatology, Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Kaohsiung, Taiwan; Department of Cosmetic Applications and Management, Yuh Ying Junior College of Healthcare and Management, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.

The polymer was purified by several separation methods, including ultracentrifugation and chromatographic procedures, and the structure was elucidated by means of chemical analysis, 1-D, and 2-D NMR spectroscopy techniques. It was found that the polysaccharide consists of branched hexasaccharide repeating units containing two 2-N-acetyl-2-deoxy-d-galacturonic acids, and one of each of 2-N-acetyl-2-deoxy-d-glucose, d-glucose, d-ribose, and 7-N-acetylamino-3,5,7,9-tetradeoxy-5-N-[(R)-2-hydroxypropanoylamino]- l-glycero-l-manno-non-2-ulosonic acid.

METHODS: We undertook a genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis for VTE in consecutively treated children in the Nordic/Baltic acute lymphoblastic leukemia 2008 (ALL2008) cohort and the Australian Evaluation of Risk of ALL Treatment-Related Side-Effects (ERASE) cohort. A total of 92 cases and 1481 controls of European ancestry were included. RESULTS: No SNPs reached genome-wide significance (p < 5 x 10(-8)) in either cohort. Among the top 34 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (p < 1 x 10(-6)), two loci had concordant effects in both cohorts: ALOX15B (rs1804772) (MAF: 1%; p = 3.95 x 10(-7)) that influences arachidonic acid metabolism and thus platelet aggregation, and KALRN (rs570684) (MAF: 1%; p = 4.34 x 10(-7)) that has been previously associated with risk of ischemic stroke, atherosclerosis, and early-onset coronary artery disease. CONCLUSION: This represents the largest GWAS meta-analysis conducted to date associating SNPs to VTE in children and adolescents treated on childhood ALL protocols. Validation of these findings is needed and may then lead to patient stratification for VTE preventive interventions. As VTE hemostasis involves multiple pathways, a more powerful GWAS is needed to detect combination of variants associated with VTE.","['Mateos, Marion K', 'Tulstrup, Morten', 'Quinn, Michael Cj',

While the existing research focuses on nuclear genome-derived (nu)-circRNAs, the biological and clinical characteristics of mitochondrial genome-derived (mt)-circRNAs remain largely unknown, especially in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). In this study, we attempted to identify the novel characteristics of mc-COX2 (mitochondrial genome-derived circRNAs [mc]), one of the mt-circRNAs that can be involved in CLL progression. mt-circRNAs were found to be highly expressed in the plasma exosomes of CLL patients. The endogenous reduction of mc-COX2 can affect mitochondrial functions, suppress cell proliferation, and induce cell apoptosis. The upregulation of mc-COX2 was positively associated with leukemogenesis and worsening survival of CLL patients. Notably, functional analysis revealed that mc-COX2, as differing from conventional nu-circRNAs, was less stable and may function through novel mechanisms other than acting as the competing endogenous RNA. We also screened and tested several chemical compounds and small-molecule inhibitors that can decrease the generation of mc-COX2. It was found that the silencing of mc-COX2 in CLL cells strengthened the anti-tumor effects of drugs used in coordination. Our findings prove that mc-COX2, a critical mt-circRNA highly expressed in plasma, derived from CLL cells and delivered by exosomes, is associated with the progression and prognosis of CLL.","['Wu, Zijuan', 'Sun, Handong', 'Wang, Chunling', 'Liu, Wenjie', 'Liu, Ming', 'Zhu, Yanhui', 'Xu, Wei', 'Jin, Hui', 'Li, Jianyong']","['Wu Z', 'Sun H', 'Wang C', 'Liu W', 'Liu M', 'Zhu Y', 'Xu W', 'Jin H', 'Li J']","['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing 210029, China; Key Laboratory of Hematology of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing 210029, China; Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Personalized Medicine, Nanjing 210029, China.', 'Department of Breast Surgery, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing 210029, China.', ""Key Laboratory of Hematology of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing 210029, China; Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Huaian No. 1 People's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Huai'an 223300, China."", 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing 210029, China; Key Laboratory of Hematology of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing 210029, China; Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Personalized Medicine, Nanjing 210029, China.', 'Guangzhou Geneseed Biotech, Guangzhou 510000, China.', 'Department of Breast Surgery, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing 210029, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing 210029, China; Key Laboratory of Hematology of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing 210029, China; Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Personalized Medicine, Nanjing 210029, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing 210029, China; Key Laboratory of Hematology of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing 210029, China; Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Personalized Medicine, Nanjing 210029, China.

Various sources of exposure have been explored, but few studies have investigated the risk of childhood AL in relation to residential exposure to agricultural pesticides. Since around 50% of France is agricultural land, with marked pesticide use, France is a suitable location to investigate for an association. We aimed to analyze the association between the agricultural crop density in the municipalities of France and the incidence of childhood AL between 1990 and 2014. METHODS: 11,487 cases of AL diagnosed in children aged 0-14 years were registered by the French National Registry of Childhood Hematological Malignancies over 1990-2014. National agricultural census data for 1990, 2000 and 2010 were used to estimate the densities of the most common crops in France. The incidence of AL was estimated in the 35,512 municipalities, by age and gender, and 3 observation periods, and expressed as the standardized incidence ratio (SIR). RESULTS: We observed a moderate log-linear association between viticulture density and the incidence of AL, with a 3% increase in SIR for a 10% increase in viticulture density (SIRR = 1.03; 95%CI [1.00-1.06]). The association remained for lymphoblastic AL but not for myeloid AL. The association was stable after stratification by geographic area, age and period, and after adjustment on UV radiation and a French deprivation index. No consistent association was observed for other crop types. DISCUSSION: This nationwide study shows a moderate increase in incidence of childhood AL in municipalities where viticulture is common.

Likewise, the role of dose intensity is not clear. We conducted a nonrandomized, prospective, phase II trial using low-dose, later escalated to high-dose (myeloablative conditioning), busulfan with fludarabine (Bu-Flu) in myelofibrosis patients up to age 74 years. The first 15 patients received i.v. busulfan 130 mg/m(2)/day on days -3 and -2 (""low dose""); 31 patients received high-dose conditioning, either 100 mg/m(2)/day (days -5 to -2; n = 4) or pharmacokinetic-guided area under the curve of 4000 mumol/min (days -5 to -2; n = 27). The primary endpoint was day 100 nonrelapse mortality (NRM). Median age was 58 years (interquartile range [IQR], 53-63). Dynamic international prognostic scoring system-plus was intermediate (n = 28) or high (n = 18). Donors were related (n = 19) or unrelated (n = 27). Cumulative incidence of NRM was 9.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0-20.3) at day 100 and at 3 years in the high-dose group and 0% in the low-dose group at day 100, which increased to 20% (95% CI, 0-41.9) at 3 years. With a median follow-up of 5.1 years (IQR, 3.8-6), 3-year relapse was 32.3% (95% CI, 15.4-49.1) in high dose versus 53.3% (95% CI, 26.6-80.1) in low dose. Event-free survival was 58% (95% CI, 43-78) versus 27% (95% CI, 12-62), and overall survival was 74% (95% CI, 60-91) versus 60% (95% CI, 40-91). In multivariate analysis, high-dose busulfan had a trend toward lower relapse (hazard ratio, .44; 95% CI, .18-1.07; P = .07), with no impact on NRM. Intensifying the Bu-Flu regimen using pharmacokinetic-monitoring appears to be promising in reducing relapse without increasing NRM.","['Popat, Uday', 'Mehta, Rohtesh S', 'Bassett, Roland', 'Kongtim, Piyanuch', 'Chen, Julianne', 'Alousi, Amin M', 'Anderlini, Paolo', 'Ciurea, Stefan', 'Hosing, Chitra', 'Jones, Roy', 'Kebriaei, Partow', 'Khouri, Issa', 'Lindsay, Richard PA', 'Nieto, Yago', 'Olson, Amanda', 'Oran, Betul', 'Qazilbash, Muzaffar H', 'Rondon, Gabriela', 'Shpall, Elizabeth J', 'Verstovsek, Srdan', 'Andersson, Borje S', 'Champlin, Richard E']","['Popat U', 'Mehta RS', 'Bassett R', 'Kongtim P', 'Chen J', 'Alousi AM', 'Anderlini P', 'Ciurea S', 'Hosing C', 'Jones R', 'Kebriaei P', 'Khouri I', 'Lindsay R PA', 'Nieto Y', 'Olson A', 'Oran B', 'Qazilbash MH', 'Rondon G', 'Shpall EJ', 'Verstovsek S', 'Andersson BS', 'Champlin RE']","['Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.

Overall, compared with 2017, the number of allogeneic HCTs performed in the United States increased by 1%, and the number of autologous HCTs decreased by 5%. Key findings are fewer autologous HCTs performed for non-Hodgkin lymphoma and increasing numbers of haploidentical HCTs, nearly all of which use post-transplantation cyclophosphamide for graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis. There is a continuing increase in HCT in adults age >70 years, particularly for acute myelogenous leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes.

MLL rearrangements are also present in about 10% of other pediatric and adult acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL). These translocations and others occurring in early life are associated with a dismal prognosis compared with adult leukemias carrying the same translocations. This observation suggests that infant and adult leukemias are biologically distinct but the underlying molecular mechanisms for these differences are not understood. In this work, we induced the same MLL chromosomal translocation in the embryo at the time of fetal liver hematopoiesis and in the adult hematopoietic tissues to develop disease models in mice that recapitulate human infant and adult leukemias, respectively. We successfully obtained myeloid leukemia in adult mice after MLL-ENL recombination induction using the interferon inducible Mx1-Cre line. Using this same Cre line, we generated embryonic MLL-ENL leukemias, which were more aggressive than the corresponding adult leukemias. In conclusion, we have developed a novel MLL-ENL embryonic leukemia model in mice that can be used to study some aspects of infant leukemia ontogeny.","['Sinha, Roshani', 'Porcheri, Cristina', ""d'Altri, Teresa"", 'Gonzalez, Jessica', 'Ruiz-Herguido, Cristina', 'Rabbitts, Terry', 'Espinosa, Lluis', 'Bigas, Anna']","['Sinha R', 'Porcheri C', ""d'Altri T"", 'Gonzalez J', 'Ruiz-Herguido C', 'Rabbitts T', 'Espinosa L', 'Bigas A']","[""Program in Cancer Research, Institut Hospital del Mar d'Investigacions Mediques, CIBERONC, Barcelona, Spain."", ""Program in Cancer Research, Institut Hospital del Mar d'Investigacions Mediques, CIBERONC, Barcelona, Spain."", ""Program in Cancer Research, Institut Hospital del Mar d'Investigacions Mediques, CIBERONC, Barcelona, Spain."", ""Program in Cancer Research, Institut Hospital del Mar d'Investigacions Mediques, CIBERONC, Barcelona, Spain."", ""Program in Cancer Research, Institut Hospital del Mar d'Investigacions Mediques, CIBERONC, Barcelona, Spain."", 'Institute for Cancer Research, Division of Cancer Therapeutics, Sutton, London, United Kingdom.', ""Program in Cancer Research, Institut Hospital del Mar d'Investigacions Mediques, CIBERONC, Barcelona, Spain."", ""Program in Cancer Research, Institut Hospital del Mar d'Investigacions Mediques, CIBERONC, Barcelona, Spain.

Isx, a GPR68 agonist, enhanced the sensitivity to LEN in MDSL cells. The fact that Isx is not a U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved drug prompts us to look for alternative candidates that could enhance the sensitivity of LEN in MDS as well as other hematologic malignancies, such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In the study described here, we found that regulator of calcineurin 1 (RCAN1), an endogenous inhibitor of calcineurin (CaN), was upregulated in MDSL cells in response to LEN, possibly through degradation of IKZF1. Consistently, cyclosporin (Cys), a pharmacological inhibitor of CaN, inhibited the activity of CaN and induced apoptosis in MDSL cells, indicating that CaN provided a prosurvival signal in MDSL cells. In addition, Cys enhanced the cytotoxic effect of LEN in MDS/AML cell lines as well as primary bone marrow cells from MDS patients and AML patient-derived xenograft models. Intriguingly, pretreatment with LEN reversed the suppressive effect of Cys on T-cell activation.

Here, we investigated two novel combinations: dual inhibition of the histone methyltransferases DOT1L and EZH2, and the combination with a protein synthesis inhibitor. EZH2 is the catalytic subunit in the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), and inhibition of EZH2 has been reported to have preclinical activity in KMT2A-r leukemia. When combined with DOT1L inhibition, however, we observed both synergistic and antagonistic effects. Interestingly, antagonistic effects were not due to PRC2-mediated de-repression of HOXA9. HOXA cluster genes are key canonical targets of both KMT2A and the PRC2 complex. The independence of the HOXA cluster from PRC2 repression in KMT2A-r leukemia thus affords important insights into leukemia biology. Further studies revealed that EZH2 inhibition counteracted the effect of DOT1L inhibition on ribosomal gene expression. We thus identified a previously unrecognized role of DOT1L in regulating protein production. Decreased translation was one of the earliest effects measurable after DOT1L inhibition and specific to KMT2A-rearranged cell lines. H3K79me2 chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing patterns over ribosomal genes were similar to those of the canonical KMT2A-fusion target genes in primary AML patient samples. The effects of DOT1L inhibition on ribosomal gene expression prompted us to evaluate the combination of EPZ5676 with a protein translation inhibitor. EPZ5676 was synergistic with the protein translation inhibitor homoharringtonine (omacetaxine), supporting further preclinical/clinical development of this combination. In summary, we discovered a novel epigenetic regulation of a metabolic process-protein synthesis-that plays a role in leukemogenesis and affords a combinatorial therapeutic opportunity.","['Lenard, Alexandra', 'Xie, Hongbo Michael', 'Pastuer, Taylor', 'Shank, Tyler', 'Libbrecht, Clara', 'Kingsley, Molly', 'Riedel, Simone S', 'Yuan, Zuo-Fei', 'Zhu, Nan', 'Neff, Tobias', 'Bernt, Kathrin M']","['Lenard A', 'Xie HM', 'Pastuer T', 'Shank T', 'Libbrecht C', 'Kingsley M', 'Riedel SS', 'Yuan ZF', 'Zhu N', 'Neff T', 'Bernt KM']","[""Division of Pediatric Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Center for Childhood Cancer Research, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA."", ""Division of Pediatric Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Center for Childhood Cancer Research, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA."", ""Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology/BMT, University of Colorado School of Medicine and Children's Hospital Colorado Aurora, CO."", ""Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology/BMT, University of Colorado School of Medicine and Children's Hospital Colorado Aurora, CO."", ""Division of Pediatric Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Center for Childhood Cancer Research, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA."", ""Division of Pediatric Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Center for Childhood Cancer Research, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA."", ""Division of Pediatric Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Center for Childhood Cancer Research, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA."", ""Division of Pediatric Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Center for Childhood Cancer Research, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA."", 'Stem Cell Biology and Hematopoiesis Program, Blood Research Institute, Blood Center of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI; Department of Cell Biology, Neurobiology and Anatomy, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI.', ""Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology/BMT, University of Colorado School of Medicine and Children's Hospital Colorado Aurora, CO."", ""Division of Pediatric Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Center for Childhood Cancer Research, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA; Department of Pediatrics, Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania and Abramson Cancer Center, Philadelphia, PA.

The study was designed to examine whether the interaction between ciprofloxacin, one of the fluoroquinolones derivative, and MITF/Mcl-1 proteins affects C32 melanoma cells viability, proliferation and induces apoptosis. Preliminary molecular docking studies, Western blot analysis and fluorescence image cytometry were applied to demonstrate the signaling pathway underlying antiproliferative and proapoptotic effect of the drug. In silico analysis showed that ciprofloxacin possess the ability to form complexes with MITF and Mcl-1proteins. This phenomenon was confirmed by in vitro experimental model where the drug was found to decrease MITF and increase Mcl-1 expression at the protein level. Moreover, we found that ciprofloxacin decreases the cell viability and exerts anti-proliferative effect on amelanotic C32 melanoma cells. Image cytometric studies showed that the tested drug induced GSH depletion and apoptosis via intrinsic death pathway leading to DNA fragmentation. Analysis of the cell cycle distribution revealed that ciprofloxacin caused a block in the G2/M phase. This is the first study that characterized the role of MITF and Mcl-1 proteins in the antiproliferative and pro-apoptotic effect of ciprofloxacin towards amelanotic melanoma cells, opening the possibility to use of this drug as a potential agent for the treatment of melanoma.","['Beberok, Artur', 'Rok, Jakub', 'Rzepka, Zuzanna', 'Marciniec, Krzysztof', 'Boryczka, Stanislaw', 'Wrzesniok, Dorota']","['Beberok A', 'Rok J', 'Rzepka Z', 'Marciniec K', 'Boryczka S', 'Wrzesniok D']","['Medical University of Silesia, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences in Sosnowiec, Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Jagiellonska 4, 41-200 Sosnowiec, Poland.

The overexpression and activation of c-kit are thought to promote tumor growth and have been reported in various cancers, including leukemia, glioblastoma and mastocytosis. To disrupt the SCF/c-kit signaling axis in cancer, we generated a c-kit antagonist human antibody (NN2101) that binds to domain 2/3 of c-kit. This completely blocked the SCF-mediated phosphorylation of c-kit and inhibited TF-1 cell proliferation, erythroleukemia. In addition, the examination of binding affinity using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) assay showed that NN2101 can bind to c-kit of monkeys (KD = 2.92 x 10(-10) M), rats (KD = 1.68 x 10(-6) M), mice (KD = 11.5 x 10(-9) M), and humans (KD = 2.83 x 10(-12) M). We showed that NN2101 does not cause antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity and complement-dependent cytotoxicity. The immunogenicity of NN2101 was similar to that of bevacizumab. Furthermore, the crystal structure of NN2101 Fab was determined and the structure of NN2101 Fab:c-kit complex was modeled. Structural information, as well as mutagenesis results, revealed that NN2101 can bind to the SCF-binding regions of c-kit. Collectively, we generated a c-kit neutralizing human antibody (NN2101) for the treatment of erythroleukemia and characterized its biophysical properties. NN2101 can potentially be used as a therapeutic antibody to treat different cancers.","['Kim, Jin-Ock', 'Kim, Ha-Neul', 'Kim, Kwang-Hyeok', 'Baek, Eun Ji', 'Park, Jeong-Yang', 'Ha, Kyungsoo', 'Heo, Deok Rim', 'Seo, Min-Duk', 'Park, Sang Gyu']","['Kim JO', 'Kim HN', 'Kim KH', 'Baek EJ', 'Park JY', 'Ha K', 'Heo DR', 'Seo MD', 'Park SG']","['College of Pharmacy and Research Institute of Pharmaceutical Science and Technology (RIPST), Ajou University, 206 World Cup-ro, Yeongtong-gu, Suwon-si, Gyeonggi-do 16499, Republic of Korea.', 'College of Pharmacy and Research Institute of Pharmaceutical Science and Technology (RIPST), Ajou University, 206 World Cup-ro, Yeongtong-gu, Suwon-si, Gyeonggi-do 16499, Republic of Korea; Department of Molecular Science and Technology, Ajou University, 206 World Cup-ro, Yeongtong-gu, Suwon-si, Gyeonggi-do 16499, Republic of Korea.', 'College of Pharmacy and Research Institute of Pharmaceutical Science and Technology (RIPST), Ajou University, 206 World Cup-ro, Yeongtong-gu, Suwon-si, Gyeonggi-do 16499, Republic of Korea.', 'College of Pharmacy and Research Institute of Pharmaceutical Science and Technology (RIPST), Ajou University, 206 World Cup-ro, Yeongtong-gu, Suwon-si, Gyeonggi-do 16499, Republic of Korea.', 'College of Pharmacy and Research Institute of Pharmaceutical Science and Technology (RIPST), Ajou University, 206 World Cup-ro, Yeongtong-gu, Suwon-si, Gyeonggi-do 16499, Republic of Korea; Department of Molecular Science and Technology, Ajou University, 206 World Cup-ro, Yeongtong-gu, Suwon-si, Gyeonggi-do 16499, Republic of Korea.', 'New Drug Development Center, Osong Medical Innovation Foundation, Osong 28160, Republic of Korea.', 'New Drug Development Center, Osong Medical Innovation Foundation, Osong 28160, Republic of Korea; College of Pharmacy and Medical Research Center, Chungbuk National University, Osongsaengmyeong 1-ro, Osong 28160, Republic of Korea.', 'College of Pharmacy and Research Institute of Pharmaceutical Science and Technology (RIPST), Ajou University, 206 World Cup-ro, Yeongtong-gu, Suwon-si, Gyeonggi-do 16499, Republic of Korea; Department of Molecular Science and Technology, Ajou University, 206 World Cup-ro, Yeongtong-gu, Suwon-si, Gyeonggi-do 16499, Republic of Korea; Novelty Nobility, 227 Unjung-ro, Seongnam-si, Gyeonggi-do 13477, Republic of Korea.

The antitumor activity originates from the capacity of the drug to modulate several signaling effectors in cancer cells, mainly the estrogen receptor splice variant ERalpha36, the transcription factors STAT3 and NFkappaB, and the chemokine receptor CXCR4. Recent studies have implicated additional components, including different microRNAs, the generation of reactive oxygen species and the targeting of sphingosine kinase-1. ICT also engages the RAGE-HMGB1 signaling route and modulates the apoptosis/autophagy crosstalk to promote its anticancer activity. In addition, ICT exerts profound changes on the tumor microenvironment to favor an immune-response. Collectively, these multiple biochemical and cellular characteristics confer to ICT a robust activity profile which can be exploited to treat HCC, as well as other cancers, including glioblastoma and onco-hematological diseases such as chronic myeloid leukemia. This review provides an update of the pharmacological properties of ICT and its metabolic characteristics. It also addresses the design of derivatives, including both natural products and synthetic molecules, such as SNG1153 also in clinical trial. The prenylated flavonoid ICT deserves attention as a multifunctional natural product potentially useful to improve the treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.","['Bailly, Christian']",['Bailly C'],"['OncoWitan, Lille, Wasquehal, 59290, France.

For decades, GVHD prophylaxis has included calcineurin inhibitors, despite their incomplete efficacy and impairment of graft-versus-leukemia (GVL). Distinct from pharmacologic immune suppression, we have developed what we believe is a novel, human CD83-targeted chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell for GVHD prevention. CD83 is expressed on allo-activated conventional CD4+ T cells (Tconvs) and proinflammatory dendritic cells (DCs), which are both implicated in GVHD pathogenesis. Human CD83 CAR T cells eradicate pathogenic CD83+ target cells, substantially increase the ratio of regulatory T cells (Tregs) to allo-activated Tconvs, and provide durable prevention of xenogeneic GVHD. CD83 CAR T cells are also capable of treating xenogeneic GVHD. We show that human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) expresses CD83 and that myeloid leukemia cell lines are readily killed by CD83 CAR T cells. Human CD83 CAR T cells are a promising cell-based approach to preventing 2 critical complications of allo-HCT - GVHD and relapse. Thus, the use of human CD83 CAR T cells for GVHD prevention and treatment, as well as for targeting CD83+ AML, warrants clinical investigation.","['Shrestha, Bishwas', 'Walton, Kelly', 'Reff, Jordan', 'Sagatys, Elizabeth M', 'Tu, Nhan', 'Boucher, Justin', 'Li, Gongbo', 'Ghafoor, Tayyebb', 'Felices, Martin', 'Miller, Jeffrey S', 'Pidala, Joseph', 'Blazar, Bruce R', 'Anasetti, Claudio', 'Betts, Brian C', 'Davila, Marco L']","['Shrestha B', 'Walton K', 'Reff J', 'Sagatys EM', 'Tu N', 'Boucher J', 'Li G', 'Ghafoor T', 'Felices M', 'Miller JS', 'Pidala J', 'Blazar BR', 'Anasetti C', 'Betts BC', 'Davila ML']","['Department of Immunology, Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, Florida, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Oncology, and Transplantation, Department of Medicine, Masonic Cancer Center, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA.', 'Department of Immunology, Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, Florida, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology and Laboratory Medicine, Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, Florida, USA.', 'Department of Oncologic Sciences, University of South Florida, Tampa, Florida, USA.', 'Department of Oncologic Sciences, University of South Florida, Tampa, Florida, USA.', 'Department of Oncologic Sciences, University of South Florida, Tampa, Florida, USA.', 'Department of Oncologic Sciences, University of South Florida, Tampa, Florida, USA.', 'Department of Oncologic Sciences, University of South Florida, Tampa, Florida, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Oncology, and Transplantation, Department of Medicine, Masonic Cancer Center, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Oncology, and Transplantation, Department of Medicine, Masonic Cancer Center, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA.', 'Department of Oncologic Sciences, University of South Florida, Tampa, Florida, USA.', 'Department of Blood and Marrow Transplantation and Cellular Immunotherapy, Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, Florida, USA.', 'Division of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Department of Pediatrics, Masonic Cancer Center, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA.', 'Department of Oncologic Sciences, University of South Florida, Tampa, Florida, USA.', 'Department of Blood and Marrow Transplantation and Cellular Immunotherapy, Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, Florida, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Oncology, and Transplantation, Department of Medicine, Masonic Cancer Center, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA.', 'Department of Immunology, Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, Florida, USA.', 'Department of Oncologic Sciences, University of South Florida, Tampa, Florida, USA.', 'Department of Blood and Marrow Transplantation and Cellular Immunotherapy, Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, Florida, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 HL133823/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA077598/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA065493/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL118979/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL126530/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL147324/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 AI034495/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA076292/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL155114/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL056067/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA142106/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K08 HL116547/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Video-Audio Media']",,United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD83 antigen)', '0 (Immunoglobulins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Chimeric Antigen)']",IM,"['*Adoptive Transfer', 'Allografts', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD/*immunology', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/transplantation', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Graft vs Host Disease/immunology/pathology/*prevention & control', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulins/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology/pathology/*therapy', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*immunology', 'Receptors, Chimeric Antigen/*immunology']",PMC7456225,['NOTNLM'],"['*Cancer immunotherapy', '*Oncology', '*Stem cell transplantation', '*T cells', '*Transplantation']",2020/05/22 06:00,2021/02/09 06:00,['2020/05/22 06:00'],"['2019/12/16 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/09 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/22 06:00 [entrez]']","['135754 [pii]', '10.1172/JCI135754 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Invest. 2020 Sep 1;130(9):4652-4662. doi: 10.1172/JCI135754.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Heterogeneous data exist with multiple tyrosine kinase inhibitors; however, nilotinib is currently the only therapy that has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for treatment-free remission.

Herein, we report our discovery of potent small-molecule SHP2 degraders whose design is based upon the proteolysis-targeting chimera (PROTAC) concept. This work has led to the discovery of potent and effective SHP2 degraders, exemplified by SHP2-D26. SHP2-D26 achieves DC50 values of 6.0 and 2.6 nM in esophageal cancer KYSE520 and acute myeloid leukemia MV4;11 cells, respectively, and is capable of reducing SHP2 protein levels by >95% in cancer cells. SHP2-D26 is >30-times more potent in inhibition of phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and of cell growth than SHP099, a potent SHP2 inhibitor, in KYSE520 and MV4;11 cancer cell lines. This study demonstrates that induced SHP2 degradation is a very effective approach to inhibit the function of SHP2. Further optimization of these SHP2 degraders may lead to the development of a new class of therapies for cancers and other human diseases.","['Wang, Mingliang', 'Lu, Jianfeng', 'Wang, Mi', 'Yang, Chao-Yie', 'Wang, Shaomeng']","['Wang M', 'Lu J', 'Wang M', 'Yang CY', 'Wang S']",,['eng'],['P30 CA046592/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200521,United States,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry,9716531,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cullin Proteins)', '0 (Dipeptides)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Pyrrolidines)', '0 (SHP099)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/chemical synthesis/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cullin Proteins/metabolism', 'Dipeptides/chemical synthesis/*pharmacology', 'Drug Design', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/chemical synthesis/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Ligands', 'Piperidines/pharmacology', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Proteolysis', 'Pyrazines/chemical synthesis/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'Pyrrolidines/chemical synthesis/*pharmacology']",,,,2020/05/22 06:00,2020/12/15 06:00,['2020/05/22 06:00'],"['2020/05/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/15 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/22 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/acs.jmedchem.0c00471 [doi]'],ppublish,J Med Chem. 2020 Jul 23;63(14):7510-7528. doi: 10.1021/acs.jmedchem.0c00471.

A comparative population-based study in Utah and Norway.,e28408,10.1002/pbc.28408 [doi],"BACKGROUND: In this study, we aimed to evaluate incidence rates and family risk of the most common childhood cancers, tumors in the central nervous system (CNS), and leukemia among individuals from Norway and individuals with Scandinavian ancestry living in Utah. METHODS: We used the Utah Population Database and the Norwegian National Population Register linked to Cancer registries to identify cancers in children born between 1966 and 2015 and their first-degree relatives. We calculated incidence rates and hazards ratios. RESULTS: The overall incidence of CNS tumors increased with consecutive birth cohorts similarly in Utah and Norway (both P < 0.001). Incidence rates of leukemia were more stable and similar in both Utah and in Norway with 4.6/100 000 person-years among children (<15 years) born in the last cohort. A family history of CNS tumors was significantly associated with risk of childhood CNS tumors in Utah HR = 3.05 (95% CI 1.80-5.16) and Norway HR = 2.87 (95% CI 2.20-3.74). In Norway, children with a first-degree relative diagnosed with leukemia had high risk of leukemia (HR = 2.39, 95% CI 1.61-3.55). CONCLUSION: Despite geographical distance and assumed large lifestyle differences, two genetically linked pediatric populations show similar incidences of CNS tumors and leukemia in the period 1966-2015. CNS tumors and leukemia aggregated in families in both countries.","['Del Risco Kollerud, Ruby', 'Cannon-Albright, Lisa A', 'Haugnes, Hege S', 'Ruud, Ellen', 'Thoresen, Magne', 'Nafstad, Per', 'Blaasaas, Karl Gerhard', 'Naess, Oyvind', 'Claussen, Bjorgulf']","['Del Risco Kollerud R', 'Cannon-Albright LA', 'Haugnes HS', 'Ruud E', 'Thoresen M', 'Nafstad P', 'Blaasaas KG', 'Naess O', 'Claussen B']","['The National Centre for Occupational Rehabilitation, Norway, Norway.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, Utah.', 'Department of Oncology, University Hospital of North Norway, Tromso, Norway.', 'Institute of Clinical Medicine, UIT, The Arctic University, Tromso, Norway.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Division for Pediatric- and Adolescence Medicine, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway.', 'Institute of Clinical Medicine, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.', 'Department of Biostatistics, Oslo Centre for Biostatistics and Epidemiology, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.', 'Institute of Health and Society, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.', 'Finance Norway, Oslo, Norway.', 'Institute of Health and Society, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.', 'Institute of Health and Society, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.']",['eng'],"['P30 CA42014/NH/NIH HHS/United States', 'HHSN261201800016C/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'NU58DP0063200-01/CC/CDC HHS/United States', 'P30 CA042014/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HHSN261201800016I/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",20200521,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', '*Central Nervous System Neoplasms/epidemiology/ethnology/genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Family', 'Female', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', '*Leukemia/epidemiology/ethnology/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Norway/epidemiology', '*Registries', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Utah/epidemiology']",PMC7313725,['NOTNLM'],"['*UPDB', '*cancer in the central nervous system (CNS)', '*cancer incidence', '*children', '*familial aggregation', '*family history', '*family risk', '*leukemia']",2020/05/22 06:00,2020/09/08 06:00,['2020/05/22 06:00'],"['2020/01/17 00:00 [received]', '2020/04/24 00:00 [revised]', '2020/04/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/08 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/22 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.28408 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2020 Aug;67(8):e28408. doi: 10.1002/pbc.28408.

A short CD22 binding peptide (PV3) with a moderate affinity (Kd approximately 9 muM) was identified by screening multiple peptide candidates determined through analysis of CD22-epratuzumab complex crystal structure. PV3 binding specificity was confirmed via competitive binding inhibition, then was used as the targeting moiety on CD22-targeted liposomal nanoparticle (TNPPV3) formulations. To maximize the potential therapeutic outcome of TNPPV3 formulation, nanoparticle design parameters, such as peptide hydrophilicity, ethylene glycol linker length, valency, and particle size were optimized for maximum selective cellular uptake by CD22+ malignant cancer cells. The effects of altering design parameters one at a time on TNP uptake were evaluated using flow cytometry, and the optimal parameters for TNPPV3 were determined to be 8% peptide density, EG18 linker, and 3 lysines of 100 nm nanoparticles. This optimally designed TNPPV3 achieved approximately 4 and 40-fold enhancement of cellular uptake by CD22+ Raji cells over CD22- Jurkat and MOLT-4 cells, respectively, demonstrating selectivity for malignant cells with CD22 overexpression. Overall, this study establishes PV3 to be CD22 binding peptide with proven effectiveness as a targeting element. In future, the optimal TNPPV3 formulation will potentially achieve maximal in vivo therapeutic outcomes by efficiently targeting CD22+ blood cancer cells in vivo.","['Kim, Baksun', 'Shin, Jaeho', 'Kiziltepe, Tanyel', 'Bilgicer, Basar']","['Kim B', 'Shin J', 'Kiziltepe T', 'Bilgicer B']","['Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN 46556, USA. bbilgicer@nd.edu.', 'Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN 46556, USA. bbilgicer@nd.edu.', 'Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN 46556, USA. bbilgicer@nd.edu and Harper Cancer Research Institute, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN 46556, USA and Advanced Diagnostics and Therapeutics, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN 46556, USA.', 'Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN 46556, USA. bbilgicer@nd.edu and Harper Cancer Research Institute, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN 46556, USA and Advanced Diagnostics and Therapeutics, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN 46556, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,England,Nanoscale,Nanoscale,101525249,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CD22 protein, human)', '0 (Liposomes)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 2)', '3062P60MH9 (epratuzumab)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/chemistry/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Design', 'Endocytosis', 'Humans', 'Liposomes/chemistry/metabolism', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*metabolism/pathology', 'Nanoparticles/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Peptides/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 2/*metabolism']",,,,2020/05/22 06:00,2021/04/14 06:00,['2020/05/22 06:00'],"['2020/05/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/14 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/22 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1039/d0nr02133d [doi]'],ppublish,Nanoscale. 2020 Jun 4;12(21):11672-11683. doi: 10.1039/d0nr02133d.,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4134-2547'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

KMT2A is a transcriptional co-activator regulating gene expression during early development and hematopoiesis, but the role of KMT2A in cervical cancer remains unknown. Here, we demonstrated that KMT2A regulated cervical cancer growth via targeting VADC1. Knockdown of KMT2A significantly suppressed cell proliferation and migration and induced apoptosis in cervical cancer cells, accompanying with activation of PARP/caspase pathway and inhibition of VADC1. Overexpression of VDAC1 reversed the KMT2A knockdown-mediated regulation of cell proliferation, migration and apoptosis. The in vivo results from a cervical cancer xenograft mouse model also validated that KMT2A knockdown suppressed tumor growth by inhibiting VDAC1, whereas KMT2A overexpression promoted cervical cancer growth. Moreover, analyses of Biewenga cervix database and clinical samples showed that both KMT2A and VDAC1 were upregulated in cervix squamous cell carcinoma compared with cervix uteri tissues, and their expression was negatively correlated with the differentiation grade of cervical cancer. Our results therefore indicated that the KMT2A/VDAC1 signaling axis may be a potential new mechanism of cervical carcinogenesis.","['Zhang, Changlin', 'Hua, Yijun', 'Qiu, Huijuan', 'Liu, Tianze', 'Long, Qian', 'Liao, Wei', 'Qiu, Jiehong', 'Wang, Nang', 'Chen, Miao', 'Shi, Dingbo', 'Yan, Yue', 'Xie, Chuanbo', 'Deng, Wuguo', 'Li, Tian', 'Li, Yizhuo']","['Zhang C', 'Hua Y', 'Qiu H', 'Liu T', 'Long Q', 'Liao W', 'Qiu J', 'Wang N', 'Chen M', 'Shi D', 'Yan Y', 'Xie C', 'Deng W', 'Li T', 'Li Y']","['Department of Gynecology, The Seventh Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University, Shenzhen, China.', 'Sun Yat-Sen University Cancer Center, State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Collaborative Innovation Center of Cancer Medicine, Guangzhou, China.', 'Sun Yat-Sen University Cancer Center, State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Collaborative Innovation Center of Cancer Medicine, Guangzhou, China.', 'The Fifth Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen University, Zhuhai, China.', 'Sun Yat-Sen University Cancer Center, State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Collaborative Innovation Center of Cancer Medicine, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Gynecology, The Seventh Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University, Shenzhen, China.', 'Department of Gynecology, The Seventh Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University, Shenzhen, China.', 'College of Life Sciences, Jiaying University, Meizhou, Guangdong, China.', 'Sun Yat-Sen University Cancer Center, State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Collaborative Innovation Center of Cancer Medicine, Guangzhou, China.', 'Sun Yat-Sen University Cancer Center, State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Collaborative Innovation Center of Cancer Medicine, Guangzhou, China.', 'Sun Yat-Sen University Cancer Center, State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Collaborative Innovation Center of Cancer Medicine, Guangzhou, China.', 'Sun Yat-Sen University Cancer Center, State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Collaborative Innovation Center of Cancer Medicine, Guangzhou, China.', 'Sun Yat-Sen University Cancer Center, State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Collaborative Innovation Center of Cancer Medicine, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Gynecology, The Seventh Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University, Shenzhen, China.', 'Sun Yat-Sen University Cancer Center, State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Collaborative Innovation Center of Cancer Medicine, Guangzhou, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200521,United States,Aging (Albany NY),Aging,101508617,"['0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (VDAC1 protein, human)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 1.6.- (Voltage-Dependent Anion Channel 1)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/genetics', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/*genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement/genetics', 'Cell Proliferation/genetics', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Cervix Uteri/metabolism/pathology', 'Female', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/genetics', 'Up-Regulation/genetics', 'Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Voltage-Dependent Anion Channel 1/*metabolism']",PMC7288919,['NOTNLM'],"['*KMT2A', '*VDAC1', '*cervical cancer']",2020/05/22 06:00,2021/02/20 06:00,['2020/05/22 06:00'],"['2019/09/13 00:00 [received]', '2020/04/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/20 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/22 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.18632/aging.103229 [doi]', '103229 [pii]']",ppublish,Aging (Albany NY). 2020 May 21;12(10):9604-9620. doi: 10.18632/aging.103229.

WNT7A is expressed in normal peripheral lymphocytes, but is decreased in the tumoral counterpart. Furthermore, the treatment of leukemic cells with recombinant WNT7A decreases proliferation, suggesting its possible use as a therapeutic biomolecule. This study aimed to evaluate the concomitant action of WNT7A and different chemotherapeutic agents over proliferation and cell death of leukemia/ lymphoma derived cell lines. METHODS: Ectopic expression of WNT7A was induced in CEM and BJAB cell lines by using a lentiviral system. RNA expression was analyzed by microarrays and qPCR, and protein expression was determined by Western Blot. Cell proliferation was measured by cell counting, metabolic activity by WST-1 assay, cell death and DNA content by flow cytometry. RESULTS: WNT7A ectopic expression was shown to decrease cell proliferation, but the apoptosis rate of leukemic cells was not altered. Moreover, these cells acquired resistance to doxorubicin, vincristine and MG-132. Cell cycle analysis reveals a decrease in G1 and an increase in S and G2 phases with a further upregulation of senescence- associated genes. Microarray analysis reveals that most gene expression changes were related to cancer and metabolic associated pathways. All those changes appear to be independent of the WNT canonical pathway regulation. CONCLUSION: WNT7A negatively regulates cell proliferation in leukemic cell lines and promotes resistance to chemotherapeutic agents by inducing a senescence-like phenotype independently of the WNT canonical pathway.","['Alvarez-Zavala, Monserrat', 'Barreto-Vargas, Christian', 'Torres-Reyes, Luis A', 'De la Pena-Castro, Roberto F', 'Aguilar-Lemarroy, Adriana', 'Jave-Suarez, Luis F']","['Alvarez-Zavala M', 'Barreto-Vargas C', 'Torres-Reyes LA', 'De la Pena-Castro RF', 'Aguilar-Lemarroy A', 'Jave-Suarez LF']","['Instituto de Investigacion en Inmunodeficiencias y VIH, Departamento de Clinicas Medicas, Centro Universitario de Ciencias de la Salud (CUCS), Universidad de Guadalajara, Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico.', 'Division de Inmunologia, Centro de Investigacion Biomedica de Occidente (CIBO), Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (IMSS), Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico.', 'Departamento de Biologia Molecular y Genomica, CUCS, Universidad de Guadalajara, Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico.', 'Division de Inmunologia, Centro de Investigacion Biomedica de Occidente (CIBO), Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (IMSS), Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico.', 'Division de Inmunologia, Centro de Investigacion Biomedica de Occidente (CIBO), Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (IMSS), Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico.', 'Division de Inmunologia, Centro de Investigacion Biomedica de Occidente (CIBO), Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (IMSS), Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,Anticancer Agents Med Chem,Anti-cancer agents in medicinal chemistry,101265649,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Leupeptins)', '0 (WNT7A protein, human)', '0 (Wnt Proteins)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'RF1P63GW3K (benzyloxycarbonylleucyl-leucyl-leucine aldehyde)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Doxorubicin/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'Leupeptins/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vincristine/*pharmacology', 'Wnt Proteins/*genetics/metabolism']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*WNT signaling', '*WNT7A', '*cell cycle', '*chemotherapeutic agents', '*leukemias', '*senescence']",2020/05/22 06:00,2021/06/02 06:00,['2020/05/22 06:00'],"['2019/10/02 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/08 00:00 [revised]', '2020/02/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/02 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/22 06:00 [entrez]']","['ACAMC-EPUB-106825 [pii]', '10.2174/1871520620666200521114100 [doi]']",ppublish,Anticancer Agents Med Chem. 2020;20(12):1504-1514. doi: 10.2174/1871520620666200521114100.,,,"['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.net.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In many cases relapse occurs when leukemic cells escape from immune surveillance. Methods & results: In the setting of haploidentical transplantation, immune escape is usually the result of the loss of the mismatched haplotype from leukemic cells, while downregulation of HLA-expression has been postulated as a significant cause of immune escape after transplantation with the use of HLA-matched donors. We observed that patients with acute leukemia who relapse at the time of active graft-versus-host-disease, usually develop extramedullary leukemia while they remain free of leukemia in peripheral blood and bone marrow.

CONCLUSIONS: The TAT-PBX1 fusion protein increased the proliferation of hair follicle mesenchymal stem cells and delayed their senescence by activating the AKT pathway following internalization by cells.","['Wang, Bo', 'Liu, Feilin', 'Liu, Zinan', 'Han, Xing', 'Lian, Aobo', 'Zhang, Yuying', 'Zuo, Kuiyang', 'Wang, Yuan', 'Liu, Mingsheng', 'Zou, Fei', 'Jiang, Yixu', 'Jin, Minghua', 'Liu, Xiaomei', 'Liu, Jinyu']","['Wang B', 'Liu F', 'Liu Z', 'Han X', 'Lian A', 'Zhang Y', 'Zuo K', 'Wang Y', 'Liu M', 'Zou F', 'Jiang Y', 'Jin M', 'Liu X', 'Liu J']","['Department of Toxicology, School of Public Health, Jilin University, 1163 Xinmin Avenue, Changchun, 130021, China.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, The Second Hospital of Jilin University, 218 Ziqiang Street, Changchun, 130021, China.', 'Department of Toxicology, School of Public Health, Jilin University, 1163 Xinmin Avenue, Changchun, 130021, China.', 'Department of Toxicology, School of Public Health, Jilin University, 1163 Xinmin Avenue, Changchun, 130021, China.', 'Department of Toxicology, School of Public Health, Jilin University, 1163 Xinmin Avenue, Changchun, 130021, China.', 'Department of Toxicology, School of Public Health, Jilin University, 1163 Xinmin Avenue, Changchun, 130021, China.', 'Department of Toxicology, School of Public Health, Jilin University, 1163 Xinmin Avenue, Changchun, 130021, China.', 'Department of Toxicology, School of Public Health, Jilin University, 1163 Xinmin Avenue, Changchun, 130021, China.', 'Department of Toxicology, School of Public Health, Jilin University, 1163 Xinmin Avenue, Changchun, 130021, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, The First Hospital of Jilin University, 71 Xinmin Avenue, Changchun, 130021, China.', 'Department of Toxicology, School of Public Health, Jilin University, 1163 Xinmin Avenue, Changchun, 130021, China.', 'Department of Toxicology, School of Public Health, Jilin University, 1163 Xinmin Avenue, Changchun, 130021, China.', 'Department of Toxicology, School of Public Health, Jilin University, 1163 Xinmin Avenue, Changchun, 130021, China. liuxiaom@jlu.edu.cn.', 'Department of Toxicology, School of Public Health, Jilin University, 1163 Xinmin Avenue, Changchun, 130021, China. jy_liu@jlu.edu.cn.']",['eng'],"['20190304044YY/Jilin Scientific and Technological Development Program', '2018C049-2/Jilin Scientific and Technological Development Program', 'SXGJQY2017-12/Jilin Scientific and Technological Development Program', '81573067/National Outstanding Youth Science Fund Project of National Natural', 'Science Foundation of China']",['Journal Article'],20200520,Netherlands,Biotechnol Lett,Biotechnology letters,8008051,"['0 (Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (pbx1 protein, human)', '0 (tat Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",IM,"['Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cellular Senescence/drug effects', 'Hair Follicle/*cytology', 'Humans', '*Mesenchymal Stem Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', '*Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'tat Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus/*genetics']",,['NOTNLM'],"['AKT', 'Hair follicle mesenchymal stem cells', 'PBX1', 'Protein purification', 'Senescence', 'TAT']",2020/05/22 06:00,2021/06/23 06:00,['2020/05/22 06:00'],"['2019/12/19 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/23 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/22 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s10529-020-02909-x [doi]', '10.1007/s10529-020-02909-x [pii]']",ppublish,Biotechnol Lett. 2020 Oct;42(10):1877-1885. doi: 10.1007/s10529-020-02909-x.

We evaluated pediatric oncology providers' experiences creating and delivering SCPs. We also evaluated PCPs' opinions of SCPs. METHODS: Together, oncology nurses and oncologists created individualized SCPs for leukemia patients treated at a children's hospital in Utah, with nurses in charge of inputting the majority of SCP content. We surveyed providers after each SCP was completed. We also mailed SCPs to PCPs with a survey on SCP content and their knowledge and comfort level caring for cancer survivors. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize survey content. RESULTS: A total of 6 nurses and 8 oncologists created 21 SCPs. On average, nurses assisted with 3.5 SCPs and spent 209 min (range 100-600 min) on completing their sections of each SCP, whereas oncologists assisted with 2.6 SCPs and spent 47.4 min (range 15-120). For most SCPs, there was agreement that they should be shared with PCPs (nurse surveys 71.4%, oncologist surveys 100%). Of the 15 participating PCPs, only 28% felt prepared to manage long-term effects in pediatric cancer survivors. They agreed that the SCP would improve communication with their patient's oncologist (80%) and their knowledge for future care (100%). CONCLUSIONS: SCPs require substantial clinician time to create, but are seen as useful by PCPs. PCPs require specific guidelines and resources concerning ongoing care for pediatric cancer survivors.","['Mann, Karely', 'Wu, Yelena P', 'Pannier, Samantha T', 'Hacking, Claire', 'Warner, Echo L', 'Rosen, Stephanie', 'Acharya, Akanksha', 'Wright, Jennifer', 'Gerdy, Cheryl', 'Kirchhoff, Anne C']","['Mann K', 'Wu YP', 'Pannier ST', 'Hacking C', 'Warner EL', 'Rosen S', 'Acharya A', 'Wright J', 'Gerdy C', 'Kirchhoff AC']","['Huntsman Cancer Institute, Cancer Control and Population Sciences, Salt Lake City, UT, USA.

In this patient population, antifungal prophylaxis (AP) has been associated with decreased incidence of IFIs and better survival. However, some centers have not adopted AP during induction chemotherapy for AML, as it is unclear whether AP improves outcomes in settings where the incidence of invasive mold infections is low. We retrospectively assessed the differences in clinical outcomes and resource utilization in patients undergoing 7 + 3 induction chemotherapy for AML, after implementing a policy of AP as part of a dedicated inpatient malignant hematology service (HS) at Rhode Island Hospital. Between January 1, 2007 and April 1, 2019, 56 patients with AML received AP during 7 + 3 induction chemotherapy and 52 patients did not, without significant differences in their baseline characteristics. Use of AP was associated with less proven or probable IFI (0% vs. 6%, P = 0.1) and lower all-cause in-hospital mortality (7% vs. 21%, P < 0.05), without significant increases in resource utilization or toxicities. Empiric and targeted antifungal therapies were more frequently started in the non-AP group (69%) than changed in the AP group (41%, P < 0.005). Having a dedicated inpatient malignant hematology service was also associated with improved outcomes. However, use of AP was associated with better survival (30-day post-induction survival log-rank P < 0.05), prior to the implementation of this clinical service as well, which is suggestive of an independent benefit from AP.","['Hsu, Andrew', 'Matera, Robert', 'Vieira, Kendra', 'Reagan, John L', 'Farmakiotis, Dimitrios']","['Hsu A', 'Matera R', 'Vieira K', 'Reagan JL', 'Farmakiotis D']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, The Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University, Providence, RI, USA.

The only potentially curative treatment option currently available is allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT), which through its graft-vs.-leukemia effects has the ability to eliminate residual leukemia cells. Despite its long history of success however, relapse following allo-HSCT is still a major challenge and is associated with poor prognosis. In the field of adoptive therapy, CD19-targeted chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells have yielded remarkable clinical success in certain types of B-cell malignancies, and substantial efforts aimed at translating this success to myeloid malignancies are currently underway. While complete ablation of CD19-expressing B cells, both cancerous and healthy, is clinically tolerated, the primary challenge limiting the use of CAR T cells in myeloid malignancies is the absence of a dispensable antigen, as myeloid antigens are often co-expressed on normal hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs), depletion of which would lead to intolerable myeloablation. This review provides a discussion on the current state of CAR T cell therapy in myeloid malignancies, limitations for clinical translation, as well as the most recent approaches to overcome these barriers, through various genetic modification and combinatorial strategies in an attempt to make CAR T cell therapy a safe and viable option for patients with myeloid malignancies.","['Mardiana, Sherly', 'Gill, Saar']","['Mardiana S', 'Gill S']","['Center for Cellular Immunotherapies, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA, United States.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology and Center for Cellular Immunotherapies, University of Pennsylvania, PA, United States.', 'Center for Cellular Immunotherapies, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA, United States.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology and Center for Cellular Immunotherapies, University of Pennsylvania, PA, United States.']",['eng'],"['K08 CA194256/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA214278/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200506,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,,PMC7218049,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'adoptive therapy', 'chimeric antigen receptor', 'engineered T cells', 'immunotherapy']",2020/05/22 06:00,2020/05/22 06:01,['2020/05/22 06:00'],"['2020/02/15 00:00 [received]', '2020/04/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/05/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/22 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2020.00697 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2020 May 6;10:697. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2020.00697. eCollection 2020.,,,['Copyright (c) 2020 Mardiana and Gill.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, it has been shown that CBFA2T3 maintains leukemia stem cell gene expression and promotes relapse in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, a role for CBFA2T3 in myeloid differentiation of AML has not been reported. Here, we show that CBFA2T3 represses retinoic acid receptor (RAR) target gene expression and inhibits all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA)-induced myeloid differentiation of AML cells. ChIP-Seq revealed that CBFA2T3 targets the RARalpha/RXRalpha cistrome in U937 AML cells, predominantly at myeloid-specific enhancers associated with terminal differentiation. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated abrogation of CBFA2T3 resulted in spontaneous and ATRA-induced activation of myeloid-specific genes in a manner correlated with myeloid differentiation. Importantly, these effects were reversed by CBFA2T3 re-expression. Mechanistic studies showed that CBFA2T3 inhibits RAR target gene transcription by acting at an early step to regulate histone acetyltransferase recruitment, histone acetylation, and chromatin accessibility at RARalpha target sites, independently of the downstream, RAR-mediated steps of transcription. Finally, we validated the inhibitory effect of CBFA2T3 on RAR in multiple AML subtypes and patient samples. To our knowledge, this is the first study to show that CBFA2T3 down-regulation is both necessary and sufficient for enhancing ATRA-induced myeloid gene expression and differentiation of AML cells. Our findings suggest that CBFA2T3 can serve as a potential target for enhancing AML responsiveness to ATRA differentiation therapies.","['Steinauer, Nickolas', 'Guo, Chun', 'Zhang, Jinsong']","['Steinauer N', 'Guo C', 'Zhang J']","['Department of Pharmacology and Physiology, Saint Louis University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Physiology, Saint Louis University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Physiology, Saint Louis University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri, USA.

METHODS: A total of 161 children who were initially diagnosed with non-CBF AML from April 2005 to December 2015 were enrolled as study subjects, and were divided into a CAMS-2005 regimen group (n=52) and a CAMS-2009 regimen group (n=109) according to the chemotherapy regimen provided. The efficacy was retrospectively compared between the two groups. RESULTS: The complete remission (CR) rate at the first course of treatment was higher in the CAMS-2009 regimen group than that in the CMAS-2005 regimen group (63.3% vs 46.2%; P<0.05). There were no significant differences between the two groups in treatment-related mortality rate (11.9% vs 17.3%), recurrence rate (27.5% vs 28.8%), and three-year overall survival (OS) rate (44%+/-5% vs 28%+/-6%) (P>0.05).

Given its increasing use, we sought to determine risk factors for GVHD after haploidentical hematopoietic cell transplantation (haplo-HCT) using PTCy. Data from the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research on adult patients with acute myeloid leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, or chronic myeloid leukemia who underwent PTCy-based haplo-HCT (2013 to 2016) were analyzed and categorized into 4 groups based on myeloablative (MA) or reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) and bone marrow (BM) or peripheral blood (PB) graft source. In total, 646 patients were identified (MA-BM = 79, MA-PB = 183, RIC-BM = 192, RIC-PB = 192). The incidence of grade 2 to 4 acute GVHD at 6 months was highest in MA-PB (44%), followed by RIC-PB (36%), MA-BM (36%), and RIC-BM (30%) (P = .002). The incidence of chronic GVHD at 1 year was 40%, 34%, 24%, and 20%, respectively (P < .001). In multivariable analysis, there was no impact of stem cell source or conditioning regimen on grade 2 to 4 acute GVHD; however, older donor age (30 to 49 versus <29 years) was significantly associated with higher rates of grade 2 to 4 acute GVHD (hazard ratio [HR], 1.53; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.11 to 2.12; P = .01). In contrast, PB compared to BM as a stem cell source was a significant risk factor for the development of chronic GVHD (HR, 1.70; 95% CI, 1.11 to 2.62; P = .01) in the RIC setting. There were no differences in relapse or overall survival between groups. Donor age and graft source are risk factors for acute and chronic GVHD, respectively, after PTCy-based haplo-HCT. Our results indicate that in RIC haplo-HCT, the risk of chronic GVHD is higher with PB stem cells, without any difference in relapse or overall survival.","['Im, Annie', 'Rashidi, Armin', 'Wang, Tao', 'Hemmer, Michael', 'MacMillan, Margaret L', 'Pidala, Joseph', 'Jagasia, Madan', 'Pavletic, Steven', 'Majhail, Navneet S', 'Weisdorf, Daniel', 'Abdel-Azim, Hisham', 'Agrawal, Vaibhav', 'Al-Homsi, A Samer', 'Aljurf, Mahmoud', 'Askar, Medhat', 'Auletta, Jeffery J', 'Bashey, Asad', 'Beitinjaneh, Amer', 'Bhatt, Vijaya Raj', 'Byrne, Michael', 'Cahn, Jean-Yves', 'Cairo, Mitchell', 'Castillo, Paul', 'Cerny, Jan', 'Chhabra, Saurabh', 'Choe, Hannah', 'Ciurea, Stefan', 'Daly, Andrew', 'Perez, Miguel Angel Diaz', 'Farhadfar, Nosha', 'Gadalla, Shahinaz M', 'Gale, Robert', 'Ganguly, Siddhartha', 'Gergis, Usama', 'Hanna, Rabi', 'Hematti, Peiman', 'Herzig, Roger', 'Hildebrandt, Gerhard C', 'Lad, Deepesh P', 'Lee, Catherine', 'Lehmann, Leslie', 'Lekakis, Lazaros', 'Kamble, Rammurti T', 'Kharfan-Dabaja, Mohamed A', 'Khandelwal, Pooja', 'Martino, Rodrigo', 'Murthy, Hemant S', 'Nishihori, Taiga', ""O'Brien, Tracey A"", 'Olsson, Richard F', 'Patel, Sagar S', 'Perales, Miguel-Angel', 'Prestidge, Tim', 'Qayed, Muna', 'Romee, Rizwan', 'Schoemans, Helene', 'Seo, Sachiko', 'Sharma, Akshay', 'Solh, Melhem', 'Strair, Roger', 'Teshima, Takanori', 'Urbano-Ispizua, Alvaro', 'Van der Poel, Marjolein', 'Vij, Ravi', 'Wagner, John L', 'William, Basem', 'Wirk, Baldeep', 'Yared, Jean A', 'Spellman, Steve R', 'Arora, Mukta', 'Hamilton, Betty K']","['Im A', 'Rashidi A', 'Wang T', 'Hemmer M', 'MacMillan ML', 'Pidala J', 'Jagasia M', 'Pavletic S', 'Majhail NS', 'Weisdorf D', 'Abdel-Azim H', 'Agrawal V', 'Al-Homsi AS', 'Aljurf M', 'Askar M', 'Auletta JJ', 'Bashey A', 'Beitinjaneh A', 'Bhatt VR', 'Byrne M', 'Cahn JY', 'Cairo M', 'Castillo P', 'Cerny J', 'Chhabra S', 'Choe H', 'Ciurea S', 'Daly A', 'Perez MAD', 'Farhadfar N', 'Gadalla SM', 'Gale R', 'Ganguly S', 'Gergis U', 'Hanna R', 'Hematti P', 'Herzig R', 'Hildebrandt GC', 'Lad DP', 'Lee C', 'Lehmann L', 'Lekakis L', 'Kamble RT', 'Kharfan-Dabaja MA', 'Khandelwal P', 'Martino R', 'Murthy HS', 'Nishihori T', ""O'Brien TA"", 'Olsson RF', 'Patel SS', 'Perales MA', 'Prestidge T', 'Qayed M', 'Romee R', 'Schoemans H', 'Seo S', 'Sharma A', 'Solh M', 'Strair R', 'Teshima T', 'Urbano-Ispizua A', 'Van der Poel M', 'Vij R', 'Wagner JL', 'William B', 'Wirk B', 'Yared JA', 'Spellman SR', 'Arora M', 'Hamilton BK']","['University of Pittsburgh/UPMC Hillman Cancer Center, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.', 'Division of Hematology, Oncology and Transplantation, Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota.', 'Department of Medicine, Medical College of Wisconsin, CIBMTR(R) (Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research), Milwaukee, Wisconsin; Division of Biostatistics, Institute for Health and Equity, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, Wisconsin.', 'Department of Medicine, Medical College of Wisconsin, CIBMTR(R) (Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research), Milwaukee, Wisconsin.', 'Blood and Marrow Transplant Program, Department of Pediatrics, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota.', 'H.

Previous studies have demonstrated that telomerase activity is associated with deregulated self-renewal of leukemia stem cells (LSCs). Here, we identified a novel compound IX, an imatinib derivative with a replacement fragment of a telomerase inhibitor, which can effectively eradicate LSCs but had no influence on normal hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) survival. We showed that compound IX can decrease the viability of drug-resistant K562/G cells and blast crisis CML primary patient cells. Besides, IX can affect LSC survival, inhibit the colony-forming ability, and reduce LSC frequency. In vivo results showed that IX can relieve the tumor burden in patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model and prolong the lifespan. We observed that compound IX can not only decrease telomerase activity, but also affect the alternative lengthening of telomeres. In addition, IX can inhibit both the canonical and non-canonical Wnt pathways. Our data suggested this novel compound IX as a promising candidate for drug-resistant leukemia therapy.","['Li, Yinghui', 'Gu, Jiali', 'Ding, Yahui', 'Gao, Huier', 'Li, Yafang', 'Sun, Yue', 'He, Mei', 'Zhang, Wenshan', 'Yin, Jingjing', 'Bai, Cuigai', 'Gao, Yingdai']","['Li Y', 'Gu J', 'Ding Y', 'Gao H', 'Li Y', 'Sun Y', 'He M', 'Zhang W', 'Yin J', 'Bai C', 'Gao Y']","['State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, PUMC Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine, CAMS Key Laboratory of Gene Therapy for Blood Diseases, National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, PUMC Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine, CAMS Key Laboratory of Gene Therapy for Blood Diseases, National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, PUMC Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine, CAMS Key Laboratory of Gene Therapy for Blood Diseases, National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemical Biology, College of Pharmacy and Tianjin Key Laboratory of Molecular Drug Research, Nankai University, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, PUMC Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine, CAMS Key Laboratory of Gene Therapy for Blood Diseases, National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, PUMC Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine, CAMS Key Laboratory of Gene Therapy for Blood Diseases, National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, PUMC Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine, CAMS Key Laboratory of Gene Therapy for Blood Diseases, National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, PUMC Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine, CAMS Key Laboratory of Gene Therapy for Blood Diseases, National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, PUMC Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine, CAMS Key Laboratory of Gene Therapy for Blood Diseases, National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, PUMC Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine, CAMS Key Laboratory of Gene Therapy for Blood Diseases, National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'High-throughput Molecular Drug Discovery Center, Tianjin International Joint Academy of BioMedicine, Tianjin, P.

This study was undertaken to elucidate the mechanisms of mogamulizumab-induced skin-related AEs. We analyzed the T-cell receptor beta chain repertoire in ATL patients' peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) before and after mogamulizumab. Skin-related AEs were present in 16 patients and were absent in 8 patients. Additionally, we included 11 patients before and after chemotherapy without mogamulizumab. Immune-related gene expression in PBMCs before and after mogamulizumab was also assessed (n = 24). Mogamulizumab treatment resulted in CCR4+ T-cell depletion, and the consequent lymphopenia provoked homeostatic CD8+ T-cell proliferation, as evidenced by increased expressions of CD8B and CD8A, which were significantly greater in patients with skin-related AEs than in those without them. We hypothesize that proliferation is driven by the engagement of self-antigens, including skin-related antigens, in the face of regulatory T-cell depletion. Together with the observed activated antigen presentation function, this resulted in T-cell diversification that was significantly greater in patients with skin-related AEs than in those without. We found that the CD8+ T cells that proliferated and diversified after mogamulizumab treatment were almost entirely newly emerged clones. There was an inverse relationship between the degree of CCR4+ T-cell depletion and increased CD8+ T-cell proliferation and diversification. Thus, lymphocyte-depleting mogamulizumab treatment provokes homeostatic CD8+ T-cell proliferation predominantly of newly emerging clones, some of which could have important roles in the pathogenesis of mogamulizumab-induced skin-related AEs.","['Saito, Masato', 'Ishii, Toshihiko', 'Urakawa, Itaru', 'Matsumoto, Asuka', 'Masaki, Ayako', 'Ito, Asahi', 'Kusumoto, Shigeru', 'Suzuki, Susumu', 'Takahashi, Takeshi', 'Morita, Akimichi', 'Inagaki, Hiroshi', 'Iida, Shinsuke', 'Ishida, Takashi']","['Saito M', 'Ishii T', 'Urakawa I', 'Matsumoto A', 'Masaki A', 'Ito A', 'Kusumoto S', 'Suzuki S', 'Takahashi T', 'Morita A', 'Inagaki H', 'Iida S', 'Ishida T']","['R&D Division, Kyowa Kirin Co.

Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare linked database, we identified 2263 older adults (age >/=66 years) diagnosed with AML during 2005-2015 who received a first-line HMA; 1154 (51%) received azacitidine, and 1109 (49%) received decitabine. Median survival from diagnosis was 7.1 and 8.2 months (P < .01) for azacitidine- and decitabine-treated patients, respectively. Mortality risk was higher with azacitidine vs decitabine (hazard ratio [HR], 1.11; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.01-1.21; P = .02). The findings were similar when evaluating only patients completing >/=4 cycles (42% of patients treated with either azacitidine or decitabine). These findings lost significance when evaluating those completing a standard 7-day schedule of azacitidine (34%) vs 5-day schedule for decitabine (66%) (HR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.83-1.08; P = .43). Red blood cell (RBC) transfusion independence (TI) was achieved in one-third of patients with no difference between the 2 HMAs. In conclusion, the majority of older AML patients did not receive the minimum of 4 cycles of HMA often needed to elicit clinical benefit. We observed no clinically meaningful differences between azacitidine- and decitabine-treated patients in their achievement of RBC TI or survival.","['Zeidan, Amer M', 'Wang, Rong', 'Wang, Xiaoyi', 'Shallis, Rory M', 'Podoltsev, Nikolai A', 'Bewersdorf, Jan P', 'Huntington, Scott F', 'Neparidze, Natalia', 'Giri, Smith', 'Gore, Steven D', 'Davidoff, Amy J', 'Ma, Xiaomei']","['Zeidan AM', 'Wang R', 'Wang X', 'Shallis RM', 'Podoltsev NA', 'Bewersdorf JP', 'Huntington SF', 'Neparidze N', 'Giri S', 'Gore SD', 'Davidoff AJ', 'Ma X']","['Department of Internal Medicine.', 'Cancer Outcomes, Public Policy, and Effectiveness Research Center.', 'Cancer Outcomes, Public Policy, and Effectiveness Research Center.', 'Department of Chronic Disease Epidemiology, and.', 'Cancer Outcomes, Public Policy, and Effectiveness Research Center.', 'Department of Chronic Disease Epidemiology, and.', 'Department of Internal Medicine.', 'Cancer Outcomes, Public Policy, and Effectiveness Research Center.', 'Department of Internal Medicine.', 'Cancer Outcomes, Public Policy, and Effectiveness Research Center.', 'Department of Internal Medicine.', 'Cancer Outcomes, Public Policy, and Effectiveness Research Center.', 'Department of Internal Medicine.', 'Cancer Outcomes, Public Policy, and Effectiveness Research Center.', 'Department of Internal Medicine.', 'Department of Internal Medicine.', 'Cancer Outcomes, Public Policy, and Effectiveness Research Center.', 'Department of Internal Medicine.', 'Cancer Outcomes, Public Policy, and Effectiveness Research Center.', 'Cancer Outcomes, Public Policy, and Effectiveness Research Center.', 'Department of Health Policy and Management, Yale School of Public Health, New Haven, CT.', 'Cancer Outcomes, Public Policy, and Effectiveness Research Center.', 'Department of Chronic Disease Epidemiology, and.']",['eng'],"['UL1 TR001863/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'N02 PC015105/PC/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016359/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01PC35136/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01PC35139/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,['776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)'],IM,"['Aged', 'Decitabine/therapeutic use', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy', '*Medicare', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome', 'United States/epidemiology']",PMC7252544,,,2020/05/21 06:00,2021/05/15 06:00,['2020/05/21 06:00'],"['2020/03/02 00:00 [received]', '2020/04/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/05/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/15 06:00 [medline]']","['S2473-9529(20)31295-7 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2020001779 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Adv. 2020 May 26;4(10):2192-2201. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2020001779.,,,['(c) 2020 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As per FDA comments, this provision pertains to visual ads communicated via social media, raising questions about compliance within the large e-liquid promotion community on Instagram. AIMS AND METHODS: This study examines use of warnings on promotional Instagram posts before and after provisions took effect on August 10, 2018. Netlytic was used to gather a sample of 500 promotional #eliquid and #ejuice posts from: May 2017, October 2017, March 2018, August 2018, and September 2018. The 1500 prewarning and 1000 postwarning posts were coded using content analysis. Changes in products and marketing strategies were also considered. Post volume was tracked monthly between May 2017 and February 2020. RESULTS: In the prewarning period, nicotine warning statements were absent on all posts. Following August 10, 2018, FDA compliant warnings were present on 13.6% of posts. Among US-based posts, 36.4% used the warnings, with warnings more common on posts made by e-liquid brands (52.3%) and posts promoting e-liquids with nicotine (40.0%). Promotional strategies and products did not significantly change. The share of posts made by US Instagram users decreased by 11%, although total post volume continued to grow. CONCLUSIONS: Many e-liquid promotion posts on Instagram remained noncompliant with nicotine warnings after FDA provisions took effect. The large volume of international users also limited the impact of FDA-mandated warnings on the social media environment. IMPLICATIONS: Further guidance and enforcement are needed to ensure that US e-liquid marketers on visual social media platforms adhere to current provisions, particularly for individual social media users who are sponsored by industry. The inherently global span of social media also indicates the importance of a shared approach to marketing regulations. Further work is needed to assess enforcement strategies viable for the social media environment.","['Laestadius, Linnea I', 'Wahl, Megan M', 'Vassey, Julia', 'Cho, Young Ik']","['Laestadius LI', 'Wahl MM', 'Vassey J', 'Cho YI']","['Joseph J.

In AML, clone-specific sensitivity to chemotherapy varies even within the same patient. Multiple mutations and genetic aberrations are associated with clones surviving chemotherapy. The current study explored the role of activated signaling pathways in chemoresistance as a function of cell maturation, reflected by CD34 expression. In-vitro, Kasumi-1 leukemic cell line, sorted by CD34 expression, showed increased apoptosis only in the CD34(-) subpopulation after exposure to cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C) or daunorubicin. The resistant CD34(+) subset demonstrated higher expression of ERK1/2 and BCL-2 proteins than CD34(-) cells. MEK1/2 inhibition elevated Ara-C ability to induce apoptosis in CD34(+) cells, suggesting that MEK1/2-ERK1/2 is surviving signaling, which correlates to cell maturation levels and plays a role in chemoresistance. Deep sequencing of sorted CD34(+/-) populations, both derived from the same patient samples, demonstrated various subclonal distribution of NPM1, DNMT3A and FLT3-ITD mutations. Interestingly, in these samples, p-ERK levels and apoptosis rates following chemotherapy exposure significantly differed between CD34(+/-) populations. Hence, clones may be selected due to their ability to escape apoptosis rather than a direct effect of chemotherapy on a specific mutated clone.","['Hayun, Michal', 'Zaatra, Maria', 'Itzkovich, Chen', 'Sahar, Dvora', 'Rosenberg, Dina', 'Filatova, Margarita', 'Ringelstein-Harlev, Shimrit', 'Baris, Hagit', 'Moustafa-Hawash, Nivin', 'Louria-Hayon, Igal', 'Ofran, Yishai']","['Hayun M', 'Zaatra M', 'Itzkovich C', 'Sahar D', 'Rosenberg D', 'Filatova M', 'Ringelstein-Harlev S', 'Baris H', 'Moustafa-Hawash N', 'Louria-Hayon I', 'Ofran Y']","['The Clinical Research Institute at Rambam (CRIR), Rambam Health Care Campus, Haifa, Israel.', 'The Clinical Research Institute at Rambam (CRIR), Rambam Health Care Campus, Haifa, Israel.', 'The Ruth and Bruce Rappaport Faculty of Medicine, Technion, Haifa, Israel.', 'The Clinical Research Institute at Rambam (CRIR), Rambam Health Care Campus, Haifa, Israel.', 'The Ruth and Bruce Rappaport Faculty of Medicine, Technion, Haifa, Israel.', 'Hematology Laboratory, Rambam Health Care Campus, Haifa, Israel.', 'Hematology Laboratory, Rambam Health Care Campus, Haifa, Israel.', 'Hematology Laboratory, Rambam Health Care Campus, Haifa, Israel.', 'Hematology Laboratory, Rambam Health Care Campus, Haifa, Israel.', 'Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Rambam Health Care Campus, Haifa, Israel.', 'The Clinical Research Institute at Rambam (CRIR), Rambam Health Care Campus, Haifa, Israel.', 'Genetics Institute, Rambam Health Care Campus, Haifa, Israel.', 'Genetics Institute, Rambam Health Care Campus, Haifa, Israel.', 'The Clinical Research Institute at Rambam (CRIR), Rambam Health Care Campus, Haifa, Israel.', 'The Clinical Research Institute at Rambam (CRIR), Rambam Health Care Campus, Haifa, Israel. y_ofran@rambam.health.gov.il.', 'The Ruth and Bruce Rappaport Faculty of Medicine, Technion, Haifa, Israel. y_ofran@rambam.health.gov.il.', 'Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Rambam Health Care Campus, Haifa, Israel. y_ofran@rambam.health.gov.il.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200520,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics/immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Clonal Selection, Antigen-Mediated/*genetics', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Daunorubicin/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics/*immunology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics/immunology/pathology', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/genetics/immunology', 'Mutation', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Remission Induction/methods']",PMC7239856,,,2020/05/21 06:00,2020/12/15 06:00,['2020/05/21 06:00'],"['2019/02/20 00:00 [received]', '2020/04/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/05/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-020-65061-6 [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-020-65061-6 [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2020 May 20;10(1):8349. doi: 10.1038/s41598-020-65061-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While the functional impact of chimeric transcripts from fused chromosome 21 genes such as TEL-AML1, AML1-ETO, or FUS-ERG have been extensively studied, the role of gain of chromosome 21 remains largely unknown. Gain of chromosome 21 is a frequently occurring aberration in several types of acute leukemia and can be found in up to 35% of cases. Children with Down syndrome (DS), who harbor constitutive trisomy 21, highlight the link between gain of chromosome 21 and leukemogenesis, with an increased risk of developing acute leukemia compared with other children. Clinical outcomes for DS-associated leukemia have improved over the years through the development of uniform treatment protocols facilitated by international cooperative groups. The genetic landscape has also recently been characterized, providing an insight into the molecular pathogenesis underlying DS-associated leukemia. These studies emphasize the key role of trisomy 21 in priming a developmental stage and cellular context susceptible to transformation, and have unveiled its cooperative function with additional genetic events that occur during leukemia progression. Here, using DS-leukemia as a paradigm, we aim to integrate our current understanding of the role of trisomy 21, of critical dosage-sensitive chromosome 21 genes, and of associated mechanisms underlying the development of hematological malignancies. This review will pave the way for future investigations on the broad impact of gain of chromosome 21 in hematological cancer, with a view to discovering new vulnerabilities and develop novel targeted therapies to improve long term outcomes for DS and non-DS patients.","['Laurent, Anouchka P', 'Kotecha, Rishi S', 'Malinge, Sebastien']","['Laurent AP', 'Kotecha RS', 'Malinge S']","['INSERM U1170, Gustave Roussy Institute, Universite Paris Saclay, Villejuif, France.', 'Universite Paris Diderot, Paris, France.', 'School of Pharmacy and Biomedical Sciences, Curtin University, Perth, Western Australia, Australia.', ""Department of Clinical Haematology, Oncology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Perth Children's Hospital, Perth, Western Australia, Australia."", 'Telethon Kids Cancer Centre, Telethon Kids Institute, University of Western Australia, Perth, Western Australia, Australia.', 'INSERM U1170, Gustave Roussy Institute, Universite Paris Saclay, Villejuif, France. sebastien.malinge@telethonkids.org.au.', 'Telethon Kids Cancer Centre, Telethon Kids Institute, University of Western Australia, Perth, Western Australia, Australia. sebastien.malinge@telethonkids.org.au.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20200520,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (ERG protein, human)', '0 (Transcriptional Regulator ERG)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Child', '*Chromosome Aberrations', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21', 'Down Syndrome/*complications/drug therapy', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2/genetics', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/etiology/*genetics', 'Transcriptional Regulator ERG/genetics']",PMC7387246,,,2020/05/21 06:00,2020/11/04 06:00,['2020/05/21 06:00'],"['2019/12/20 00:00 [received]', '2020/04/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/04/22 00:00 [revised]', '2020/05/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/04 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/21 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-020-0854-5 [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-020-0854-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2020 Aug;34(8):1984-1999. doi: 10.1038/s41375-020-0854-5.

T cells and antigen-presenting cells (APCs) are major components of the hematopoietic G-CSF mobilized peripheral blood cell (MPBC) graft. Here we show that a short incubation (2 h) of MPBCs with hexameric Fas ligand (FasL) selectively induces apoptosis of specific donor T cell subsets and APCs but not of CD34(+) cells. FasL treatment preferentially induces apoptosis in mature T cell subsets which express high levels of Fas (CD95), such as T stem cell memory, T central memory, and T effector memory cells, as well as TH1 and TH17 cells. Anti-CD3/CD28 stimulated T cells derived from FasL-treated-MPBCs express lower levels of CD25 and secrete lower levels of IFN-gamma as compared to control cells not treated with FasL. FasL treatment also induces apoptosis of transitional, naive, memory and plasmablastoid B cells leading to a reduction in their numbers in the graft and following engraftment in transplanted mice. Most importantly, ex vivo treatment of MPBCs with FasL prior to transplant in conditioned NOD-scid IL2Rgamma(null) (NSG) mice prevented GvHD while preserving graft versus leukemia (GvL) effects, and leading to robust stem cell engraftment.","['Levy-Barazany, Hilit', 'Shachnai-Pinkas, Liat', 'Rodionov, Galina', 'Saar, Alex', 'Rosenzwaig, Michal', 'Gez, Liron', 'Rodin, Anastasia', 'Marelly, Nitzan', 'Abraham, Michal', 'Mishalian, Inbal', 'Wildbaum, Hila', 'Katz, Tamar', 'Baar, Yuval', 'Yarkoni, Shai', 'Bakimer-Kleiner, Ronit', 'Peled, Amnon', 'Zuckerman, Tsila', 'Stein, Jerry']","['Levy-Barazany H', 'Shachnai-Pinkas L', 'Rodionov G', 'Saar A', 'Rosenzwaig M', 'Gez L', 'Rodin A', 'Marelly N', 'Abraham M', 'Mishalian I', 'Wildbaum H', 'Katz T', 'Baar Y', 'Yarkoni S', 'Bakimer-Kleiner R', 'Peled A', 'Zuckerman T', 'Stein J']","['Cellect Biotherapeutics Ltd., Kfar-Saba, Israel.', 'Cellect Biotherapeutics Ltd., Kfar-Saba, Israel.', 'Cellect Biotherapeutics Ltd., Kfar-Saba, Israel.', 'Cellect Biotherapeutics Ltd., Kfar-Saba, Israel.', 'Cellect Biotherapeutics Ltd., Kfar-Saba, Israel.', 'Cellect Biotherapeutics Ltd., Kfar-Saba, Israel.', 'Cellect Biotherapeutics Ltd., Kfar-Saba, Israel.', 'Cellect Biotherapeutics Ltd., Kfar-Saba, Israel.', 'Goldyne Savad Institute of Gene Therapy, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Jerusalem, Israel.', 'Goldyne Savad Institute of Gene Therapy, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Jerusalem, Israel.', 'Hematology Department and Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, Rambam Health Care Campus, Haifa, Israel.', 'Hematology Department and Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, Rambam Health Care Campus, Haifa, Israel.', ""BMT Unit, Department of Pediatric Hematology Oncology, Schneider Children's Medical Center, Petach Tikva, Israel."", 'Cellect Biotherapeutics Ltd., Kfar-Saba, Israel. shai@cellect.co.', 'Cellect Biotherapeutics Ltd., Kfar-Saba, Israel.', 'Goldyne Savad Institute of Gene Therapy, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Jerusalem, Israel.', 'Hematology Department and Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, Rambam Health Care Campus, Haifa, Israel.', ""BMT Unit, Department of Pediatric Hematology Oncology, Schneider Children's Medical Center, Petach Tikva, Israel."", 'Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200520,England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,"['0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Ligands)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Fas Ligand Protein', '*Graft vs Host Disease/prevention & control', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Ligands', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Stem Cells']",PMC7329633,,,2020/05/21 06:00,2021/06/22 06:00,['2020/05/21 06:00'],"['2019/10/29 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/04/22 00:00 [revised]', '2020/05/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/22 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/21 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41409-020-0941-2 [doi]', '10.1038/s41409-020-0941-2 [pii]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2020 Jul;55(7):1305-1316. doi: 10.1038/s41409-020-0941-2.

Anti-angiogenic activity was assessed according to microvessel density (MVD) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) targeting CD31 and VEGFR2. In vitro, proliferation viability, migratory activity and tube formation were measured. Western blots and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays were used to examine the levels of PI3K, Akt, and VEGF.Results: HPLC analyses revealed the active constituents of SMBJD such as liquiritin, cimifugin, ferulic, isoferulic, and glycyrrhizic acids. In vitro, SMBJD treatment decreased cellular migration, chemotaxis, and tube formation at non-cytotoxic concentrations (2, 4, and 8 mg/mL) in a time- and dose-dependent manner. The dosage of less than IC20 is considered safe. In vivo, CAM models exhibited a decrease in MVD, and the tissues of xenografted mice possessed reduced CD31 and VEGFR2 expression. Conditioned media (CM) from AML cells (HL60 and NB4 cells) treated with non-cytotoxic doses of SMBJD inhibited chemotactic migration and tube formation in vitro. Both CM (HL60) and CM (NB4) exhibited downregulated expression of PI3K, Akt, and VEGF.Discussion and conclusions: SMBJD inhibited angiogenesis in AML through the PI3K/AKT pathway, which might be combined with targeted therapy to provide more effective treatment.","['Wang, Mengya', 'Ma, Bangyun', 'Dai, Xingbin', 'Zhang, Hong', 'Dai, Huibo', 'Wang, Jingyu', 'Liu, Li', 'Sun, Xuemei']","['Wang M', 'Ma B', 'Dai X', 'Zhang H', 'Dai H', 'Wang J', 'Liu L', 'Sun X']","['Department of Hematology, No. 1 Clinical Medical College, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Jiangsu Province Hospital of TCM, The Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing University of TCM, Nanjing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Jiangsu Province Hospital of TCM, The Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing University of TCM, Nanjing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, No. 1 Clinical Medical College, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, No. 1 Clinical Medical College, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, No. 1 Clinical Medical College, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing, China.', 'The Central Laboratory of Jiangsu Province Hospital of TCM, The Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing University of TCM, Nanjing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Jiangsu Province Hospital of TCM, The Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing University of TCM, Nanjing, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,England,Pharm Biol,Pharmaceutical biology,9812552,"['0 (Angiogenesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Drugs, Chinese Herbal)']",IM,"['Angiogenesis Inhibitors/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Animals', 'Cell Movement/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects/physiology', 'Chick Embryo', 'Drugs, Chinese Herbal/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells/drug effects/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays/*methods']",PMC7301716,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'SMBJD', 'angiogenesis']",2020/05/21 06:00,2021/03/13 06:00,['2020/05/21 06:00'],"['2020/05/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/05/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/13880209.2020.1764059 [doi]'],ppublish,Pharm Biol. 2020 Dec;58(1):454-464. doi: 10.1080/13880209.2020.1764059.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the function and mechanism of TUG1 in cytarabine (Ara-C) sensitivity in AML remain unclear. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Levels of TUG1, microRNA (miR)-655-3p or cyclin D1 (CCND1) mRNA were examined using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Cell proliferation activity and apoptosis were analyzed using cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) or flow cytometry, respectively. Western blot was utilized to detect the protein levels of Ki-67, B-cell lymphoma-2-associated X protein (Bax), and CCND1. The interaction between miR-655-3p and TUG1 or CCND1 was confirmed by Dual-Luciferase reporter and pull-down assay. RESULTS: TUG1 and CCND1 were higher expressed, while miR-655-3p was lower expressed in AML cells compared with that in normal cells. Higher expression levels of TUG1 or CCND1, and lower expression levels of miR-655-3p both notably reversed Ara-C-induced proliferation inhibition and apoptosis promotion in AML cells. TUG1 was a sponge of miR-655-3p, and TUG1 knockdown enhanced the sensitivity of AML cells to Ara-C by regulating miR-655-3p. MiR-655-3p directly targeted CCND1, and CCND1 overexpression attenuated miR-655-3p restoration-mediated reinforcement of Ara-C sensitivity in AML cells. Besides that, TUG1 up-regulated CCND1 expression via miR-655-3p. CONCLUSIONS: TUG1 weakened the sensitivity of AML cells to Ara-C by up-regulating CCND1 via miR-655-3p, suggesting a new insight into the chemotherapy of AML.","['Zhang, B', 'Sun, Y-F', 'Zhang, X-M', 'Jiang, N', 'Chen, Q']","['Zhang B', 'Sun YF', 'Zhang XM', 'Jiang N', 'Chen Q']","['Department of Pediatrics, Luoyang Central Hospital Affiliated to Zhengzhou University, Luoyang, Henan, China. nvkqrj@163.com.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Italy,Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,9717360,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (CCND1 protein, human)', '0 (MIRN655 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)', '0 (TUG1 long noncoding RNA, human)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cyclin D1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'MicroRNAs/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Long Noncoding/genetics/*metabolism']",,,,2020/05/21 06:00,2021/04/01 06:00,['2020/05/21 06:00'],"['2020/05/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/05/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.26355/eurrev_202005_21185 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci. 2020 May;24(9):4940-4953. doi: 10.26355/eurrev_202005_21185.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study aims to illustrate the role of GPAA1 in promoting the metastasis of ALL by targeting c-myc and the potential mechanism. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Quantitative real time-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was performed to examine serum levels of GPAA1 and c-myc in 42 childhood ALL patients and healthy volunteers. The interaction between GPAA1 expression and prognosis of childhood ALL was analyzed. Meanwhile, expressions of GPAA1 and c-myc in ALL cell lines were determined by qRT-PCR. Furthermore, after GPAA1 knockdown model was constructed by lentivirus transfection in MOLT-4 and SUP-B15 cells, cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8), transwell invasion, and cell wound healing assays were conducted to analyze the effect of GPAA1 on the biological functions of ALL cells. Potential mechanism was further explored through Luciferase reporter gene assay and cell recovery experiments. RESULTS: QRT-PCR results indicated that serum level of GPAA1 in childhood ALL patients was remarkably higher than that of healthy volunteers, and the difference was statistically significant. Childhood ALL patients with high expression of GPAA1 had lower overall survival rate compared with those expressing low expression of GPAA1. Proliferation and metastasis abilities of pediatric ALL cells with GPAA1 knockdown remarkably decreased. Subsequently, c-myc expression was also found remarkably upregulated in ALL cell lines and serum samples of childhood ALL patients and it was positively correlated with GPAA1 level. In addition, Luciferase reporter gene assay demonstrated that overexpression of c-myc remarkably attenuated the Luciferase activity of the wild-type GPAA1 vector without attenuating that of the mutant vector or empty vector, further demonstrating that GPAA1 can be targeted by c-myc. At the same time, cell recovery experiment found that the interaction between GPAA1 and c-myc together regulated the malignant progression of ALL. CONCLUSIONS: GPAA1 was up-regulated in serum of childhood ALL patients, which was remarkably associated with the prognosis. In addition, GPAA1 may contribute to the malignant progression of childhood ALL via activating c-myc.","['Zhang, J-X', 'Wang, J-H', 'Sun, X-G', 'Hou, T-Z']","['Zhang JX', 'Wang JH', 'Sun XG', 'Hou TZ']","['Department of Pediatric Internal Medicine, Linyi Central Hospital, Linyi, China. houtianzhao@126.com.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Italy,Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,9717360,"['0 (GPAA1 protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)']",IM,"['Cells, Cultured', 'Humans', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*metabolism/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/genetics/*metabolism']",,,,2020/05/21 06:00,2021/04/01 06:00,['2020/05/21 06:00'],"['2020/05/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/05/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.26355/eurrev_202005_21182 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci. 2020 May;24(9):4931-4939. doi: 10.26355/eurrev_202005_21182.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Poisson regression and Cox analyses were utilized to identify risk factors for infections. Results: Eighty-three patients received CTI during the study period. Most patients (98%) had refractory or relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Infections occurred in 54% of patients in the 90 days before CTI (infection density, 1.23) and in 40% of patients in the first 28 days following CTI (infection density, 2.89). Infection density decreased to 0.55 in the 29-90 days post-CTI. Most infections were bacteremias (39%) or respiratory viral infections (43%). Pre-CTI risk factors associated with infection included prior hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), immunoglobulin G (IgG) level <400 mg/dL, and lymphodepletion other than cyclophosphamide plus fludarabine; post-CTI risk factors included higher-severity CRS and IgG <400 mg/dL. Conclusions: Infection rates in children and young adults receiving CD19 CAR T-cell therapy increase in the first month and then decline. Understanding types and timing of infections and contributing risk factors may help inform prophylactic and monitoring strategies. Specific attention should be given to patients with prior HCT, severe hypogammaglobulinemia, and severe CRS.","['Vora, Surabhi B', 'Waghmare, Alpana', 'Englund, Janet A', 'Qu, Pingping', 'Gardner, Rebecca A', 'Hill, Joshua A']","['Vora SB', 'Waghmare A', 'Englund JA', 'Qu P', 'Gardner RA', 'Hill JA']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA.', ""Seattle Children's Research Institute, Seattle, Washington, USA."", 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA.', 'Vaccine and Infectious Disease Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington, USA.', ""Seattle Children's Research Institute, Seattle, Washington, USA."", 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA.', ""Seattle Children's Research Institute, Seattle, Washington, USA."", ""Seattle Children's Research Institute, Seattle, Washington, USA."", 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA.', ""Seattle Children's Research Institute, Seattle, Washington, USA."", 'Vaccine and Infectious Disease Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200409,United States,Open Forum Infect Dis,Open forum infectious diseases,101637045,,,,PMC7221263,['NOTNLM'],"['ALL', 'CAR T-cell', 'immunotherapy', 'infection', 'pediatric']",2020/05/21 06:00,2020/05/21 06:01,['2020/05/21 06:00'],"['2020/01/16 00:00 [received]', '2020/04/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/05/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/21 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1093/ofid/ofaa121 [doi]', 'ofaa121 [pii]']",epublish,Open Forum Infect Dis. 2020 Apr 9;7(5):ofaa121. doi: 10.1093/ofid/ofaa121. eCollection 2020 May.,,,"['(c) The Author(s) 2020.

Recent evidences support the involvement of epithelial-to-mesenchymal (EMT) process in hematopoietic stem cell homeostasis as well as in leukemia cells invasiveness and migration capability. Here, we demonstrate that the alteration of iron homeostasis and the consequent increase of redox metabolism, mediated by the stable knock down of ferritin heavy chain (FtH), enhances the expression of CXCR4 in K562 erythroleukemia cells, thus promoting CXCL12-mediated motility. Indeed, addition of the CXCR4 receptor antagonist AMD3100 reverts this effect. Upon FtH knock down K562 cells also acquire an ""EMT-like"" phenotype, characterized by the increase of Snail, Slug and Vimentin with the parallel loss of E-cadherin. By using fibronectin as substrate, the cell adhesion assay further shows a reduction of cell adhesion capability in FtH-silenced K562 cells. Accordingly, confocal microscopy shows that adherent K562 control cells display a variety of protrusions while FtH-silenced K562 cells remain roundish. These phenomena are largely due to the reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated up-regulation of HIF-1alpha/CXCR4 axis which, in turn, promotes the activation of NF-kappaB and the enhancement of EMT features. These data are confirmed by treatments with either N-acetylcysteine (NAC) or AMD3100 or NF-kappaB inhibitor IkappaB-alpha which revert the FtH-silenced K562 invasive phenotype. Overall, our findings demonstrate the existence of a direct relationship among iron metabolism, redox homeostasis and EMT in the hematological malignancies. The effects of FtH dysregulation on CXCR4/CXCL12-mediated K562 cell motility extend the meaning of iron homeostasis in the leukemia cell microenvironment.","['Chirillo, Roberta', 'Aversa, Ilenia', 'Di Vito, Anna', 'Salatino, Alessandro', 'Battaglia, Anna Martina', 'Sacco, Alessandro', 'Di Sanzo, Maddalena Adriana', 'Faniello, Maria Concetta', 'Quaresima, Barbara', 'Palmieri, Camillo', 'Biamonte, Flavia', 'Costanzo, Francesco']","['Chirillo R', 'Aversa I', 'Di Vito A', 'Salatino A', 'Battaglia AM', 'Sacco A', 'Di Sanzo MA', 'Faniello MC', 'Quaresima B', 'Palmieri C', 'Biamonte F', 'Costanzo F']","['Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, ""Magna Graecia"" University of Catanzaro, Catanzaro, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, ""Magna Graecia"" University of Catanzaro, Catanzaro, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, ""Magna Graecia"" University of Catanzaro, Catanzaro, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, ""Magna Graecia"" University of Catanzaro, Catanzaro, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, ""Magna Graecia"" University of Catanzaro, Catanzaro, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, ""Magna Graecia"" University of Catanzaro, Catanzaro, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, ""Magna Graecia"" University of Catanzaro, Catanzaro, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, ""Magna Graecia"" University of Catanzaro, Catanzaro, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, Research Center of Biochemistry and Advanced Molecular Biology, ""Magna Graecia"" University of Catanzaro, Catanzaro, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, ""Magna Graecia"" University of Catanzaro, Catanzaro, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, ""Magna Graecia"" University of Catanzaro, Catanzaro, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, ""Magna Graecia"" University of Catanzaro, Catanzaro, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, Research Center of Biochemistry and Advanced Molecular Biology, ""Magna Graecia"" University of Catanzaro, Catanzaro, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, Research Center of Biochemistry and Advanced Molecular Biology, ""Magna Graecia"" University of Catanzaro, Catanzaro, Italy.', 'Interdepartmental Center of Services (CIS), ""Magna Graecia"" University of Catanzaro, Catanzaro, Italy.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200505,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,,PMC7214836,['NOTNLM'],"['CXCR4', 'EMT', 'NF-kappaB', 'ROS', 'ferritin heavy chain', 'hematological malignancies', 'leukemia', 'tumor microenvironment']",2020/05/21 06:00,2020/05/21 06:01,['2020/05/21 06:00'],"['2020/03/21 00:00 [received]', '2020/04/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/05/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/21 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2020.00698 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2020 May 5;10:698. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2020.00698. eCollection 2020.,,,"['Copyright (c) 2020 Chirillo, Aversa, Di Vito, Salatino, Battaglia, Sacco, Di', 'Sanzo, Faniello, Quaresima, Palmieri, Biamonte and Costanzo.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we report a case of multiple sclerosis (MS) like relapsing remitting encephalomyelitis following allogeneic HSCT, which did not respond to disease modifying therapies (DMTs) and ""domino"" autologous HSCT. A 53-year-old male was treated with allogeneic HSCT for lymphoid blast transformation of chronic myeloid leukemia. Ten months later he presented with confusion, slurred speech, left sided facial weakness and ataxia. A magnetic resonance imaging brain scan showed multiple enhancing tumefactive lesions. Neuromyelitis optica (NMO) and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) antibodies were negative. After extensive investigations for infections, autoimmune disorders and recurrence of malignancy, he underwent brain biopsy, which showed a macrophage rich lesion with severe myelin loss but axonal preservation indicating a demyelinating pathology. Although his symptoms improved with corticosteroids, he relapsed five months later. In the absence of any systemic features suggesting graft versus host disease (GvHD), his presentation was thought to be compatible with MS. The illness followed an aggressive course that did not respond to glatiramer acetate and natalizumab. He was therefore treated with ""domino"" autologous HSCT, which also failed to induce long-term remission. Despite further treatment with ocrelizumab, he died of progressive disease. An autopsy limited to the examination of brain revealed multifocal destructive leukoencephalopathy with severe myelin and axonal loss. Immunohistochemistry showed macrophage located in the perivascular area, with no T or B lymphocytes. The appearance was unusual and not typical for chronic MS plaques. Reported cases of CNS demyelination following allogeneic HSCT are very limited in the literature, especially in relation to histopathological examination. Although the clinical disease course of our patient following allogeneic HSCT resembled an ""MS-like"" relapsing remitting encephalomyelitis, the autopsy examination did not show any evidence of active inflammation. The impact of DMTs and HSCT on the histological appearance of ""MS-like"" CNS pathologies is unknown. Therefore, reporting this and similar cases will improve our awareness and understanding of underlying disease mechanisms.","['Das, Joyutpal', 'Gill, Atta', 'Lo, Christine', 'Chan-Lam, Natalie', 'Price, Sian', 'Wharton, Stephen B', 'Jessop, Helen', 'Sharrack, Basil', 'Snowden, John A']","['Das J', 'Gill A', 'Lo C', 'Chan-Lam N', 'Price S', 'Wharton SB', 'Jessop H', 'Sharrack B', 'Snowden JA']","['Department of Neurology, Salford Royal NHS Foundation Trust, Manchester, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Neurology, Royal Hallamshire Hospital, Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Sheffield, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Haematology, Royal Hallamshire Hospital, Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Sheffield, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Neurology, Royal Hallamshire Hospital, Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Sheffield, United Kingdom.', 'Sheffield Institute of Translational Neuroscience, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Haematology, Royal Hallamshire Hospital, Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Sheffield, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Neurology, Royal Hallamshire Hospital, Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Sheffield, United Kingdom.', 'Sheffield Institute of Translational Neuroscience, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Histopathology, Royal Hallamshire Hospital, Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Sheffield, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Haematology, Royal Hallamshire Hospital, Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Sheffield, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Neurology, Royal Hallamshire Hospital, Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Sheffield, United Kingdom.', 'Sheffield Institute of Translational Neuroscience, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Haematology, Royal Hallamshire Hospital, Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Sheffield, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",20200505,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,"['0 (Adrenal Cortex Hormones)', '0 (Immunologic Factors)']",IM,"['Adrenal Cortex Hormones/therapeutic use', 'Disease Progression', 'Encephalomyelitis/drug therapy/*etiology', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Graft vs Host Disease/drug therapy/*etiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Factors/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/immunology/*surgery', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Sclerosis, Relapsing-Remitting/drug therapy/*etiology', 'Recurrence', 'Transplantation, Autologous/adverse effects', 'Transplantation, Homologous/adverse effects']",PMC7214636,['NOTNLM'],"['*allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', '*graft versus host disease', '*multifocal leukoencephalopathy', '*multiple sclerosis', '*""domino"" autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation']",2020/05/21 06:00,2021/03/30 06:00,['2020/05/21 06:00'],"['2019/11/25 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/05/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2020.00668 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2020 May 5;11:668. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2020.00668. eCollection 2020.,,,"['Copyright (c) 2020 Das, Gill, Lo, Chan-Lam, Price, Wharton, Jessop, Sharrack and', 'Snowden.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Vaccine progress has been hampered, in part, by a lack of standardized assays able to quantify antibody function in test antisera. The most widely used assay was developed over 50 years ago by Rebecca Lancefield and relies on human whole blood as a source of complement and neutrophils. Recently, an opsonophagocytic killing (OPK) assay has been developed for GAS by adapting the OPK methods utilized in Streptococcus pneumoniae vaccine testing. This assay uses dimethylformamide (DMF)-differentiated human promyelocytic leukemia cells (HL-60 cells) as a source of neutrophils and baby rabbit complement, thus removing the major sources of variation in the Lancefield assays. This protocol outlines methods for performing a GAS OPK assay including titering test sera to generate an opsonic index. This in vitro assay could aid in selecting vaccine candidates by demonstrating whether candidate-induced antibodies lead to complement deposition and opsonophagocytic killing.","['McGregor, Reuben', 'Jones, Scott', 'Jeremy, Raynes M', 'Goldblatt, David', 'Moreland, Nicole J']","['McGregor R', 'Jones S', 'Jeremy RM', 'Goldblatt D', 'Moreland NJ']","['Department of Molecular Medicine and Pathology, School of Medical Sciences, The University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand. reuben.mcgregor@auckland.ac.nz.', 'Immunobiology, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, London, UK.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine and Pathology, School of Medical Sciences, The University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand.', 'Immunobiology, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, London, UK.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine and Pathology, School of Medical Sciences, The University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,Methods Mol Biol,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",9214969,"['0 (Antibodies, Bacterial)', '0 (Immune Sera)', '0 (Opsonin Proteins)', '0 (Pneumococcal Vaccines)', '0 (Vaccines)', '9007-36-7 (Complement System Proteins)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Bacterial/immunology', 'Biological Assay', 'Complement System Proteins/immunology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Immune Sera/immunology', 'Neutrophils/immunology', 'Opsonin Proteins/*immunology/metabolism', 'Phagocytosis/immunology', 'Pneumococcal Vaccines', 'Streptococcal Infections/immunology', 'Streptococcus pyogenes/*immunology', 'Vaccines/*immunology']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Antibody', '*Complement', '*Group A Streptococcus', '*HL-60 cells', '*Phagocytosis', '*Vaccine']",2020/05/21 06:00,2021/03/09 06:00,['2020/05/21 06:00'],"['2020/05/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/05/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/978-1-0716-0467-0_26 [doi]'],ppublish,Methods Mol Biol. 2020;2136:323-335. doi: 10.1007/978-1-0716-0467-0_26.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here in this study, we have revisited the concept of allostery in CBP via residue-based interaction energy calculation based on molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. To this end, we conducted MD simulations of KIX:MLL:c-Myb ternary complex, its binary components and kinase-inducible domain (KID) interacting domain (KIX) backbone. Interaction energy profiles and cross correlation analysis were performed and the results indicated that KIX:MLL and KIX:c-Myb:MLL complexes demonstrate significant similarities according to both analysis methods. Two regions in the KIX backbone were apparent from the interaction energy and cross correlation maps that hold a key to allostery phenomena observed in CBP. While one of these regions are related to the ligand binding residues, the other comprises of L12-G2 loop and alpha3 helix regions that have been found to have a significant role in allosteric signal propagation.

Although differences in cell biology and maturation exist between MDS and AML secondary to MDS, these 2 diseases are genetically related. MDS and secondary AML cells harbor mutations in many of the same genes and functional categories, including chromatin modification, DNA methylation, RNA splicing, cohesin complex, transcription factors, cell signaling, and DNA damage, confirming that they are a disease continuum. Differences in the frequency of mutated genes in MDS and secondary AML indicate that the order of mutation acquisition is not random during progression. In almost every case, disease progression is associated with clonal evolution, typically defined by the expansion or emergence of a subclone with a unique set of mutations. Monitoring tumor burden and clonal evolution using sequencing provides advantages over using the blast count, which underestimates tumor burden, and could allow for early detection of disease progression prior to clinical deterioration. In this review, we outline advances in the study of MDS to secondary AML progression, with a focus on the genetics of progression, and discuss the advantages of incorporating molecular genetic data in the diagnosis, classification, and monitoring of MDS to secondary AML progression. Because sequencing is becoming routine in the clinic, ongoing research is needed to define the optimal assay to use in different clinical situations and how the data can be used to improve outcomes for patients with MDS and secondary AML.","['Menssen, Andrew J', 'Walter, Matthew J']","['Menssen AJ', 'Walter MJ']","['Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO; and.', 'Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO; and.', 'Siteman Cancer Center, Washington University, St. Louis, MO.']",['eng'],"['P01 CA101937/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R33 CA217700/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,['F0P408N6V4 (Lenalidomide)'],IM,"['Cell Count', 'Clonal Evolution', 'DNA Methylation/drug effects', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Disease Progression', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/pathology', 'Humans', 'Lenalidomide/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/etiology/*genetics/prevention & control', 'Mutation', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Myelopoiesis', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Tumor Burden', 'Whole Exome Sequencing', 'Whole Genome Sequencing']",PMC7332895,,,2020/05/21 06:00,2021/02/18 06:00,['2020/05/21 06:00'],"['2019/09/09 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/18 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/21 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)61916-4 [pii]', '10.1182/blood.2019000942 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2020 Jul 2;136(1):50-60. doi: 10.1182/blood.2019000942.,,,['(c) 2020 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Approximately 15% to 20% of AA patients and 2% to 6% of PNH patients go on to develop secondary MDS/AML by 10 years of follow-up. Factors determining an individual patient's risk of malignant transformation remain poorly defined. Recent studies identified nearly ubiquitous clonal hematopoiesis (CH) in AA patients. Similarly, CH with additional, non-PIGA, somatic alterations occurs in the majority of patients with PNH. Factors associated with progression to secondary MDS/AML include longer duration of disease, increased telomere attrition, presence of adverse prognostic mutations, and multiple mutations, particularly when occurring early in the disease course and at a high allelic burden. Here, we will review the prevalence and characteristics of somatic alterations in AA and PNH and will explore their prognostic significance and mechanisms of clonal selection. We will then discuss the available data on post-AA and post-PNH progression to secondary MDS/AML and provide practical guidance for approaching patients with PNH and AA who have CH.","['Sun, Lova', 'Babushok, Daria V']","['Sun L', 'Babushok DV']","['Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA; and.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA; and.', ""Comprehensive Bone Marrow Failure Center, Department of Pediatrics, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA.""]",['eng'],"['K08 HL132101/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA009679/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Benzoates)', '0 (Hydrazines)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'A3ULP0F556 (eculizumab)', 'S56D65XJ9G (eltrombopag)']",IM,"['Age of Onset', 'Anemia, Aplastic/drug therapy/genetics/*pathology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Benzoates/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7/genetics', 'Clonal Evolution/drug effects', 'Clone Cells/drug effects/pathology', 'Disease Progression', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Hemoglobinuria, Paroxysmal/drug therapy/genetics/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Hydrazines/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/epidemiology/*etiology/genetics/pathology', 'Models, Biological', 'Monosomy', 'Mutation', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/epidemiology/*etiology/genetics/pathology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics', 'Pyrazoles/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Selection, Genetic', 'Telomere Shortening']",PMC7332901,,,2020/05/21 06:00,2021/02/18 06:00,['2020/05/21 06:00'],"['2019/08/26 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/18 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/21 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)61915-2 [pii]', '10.1182/blood.2019000940 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2020 Jul 2;136(1):36-49. doi: 10.1182/blood.2019000940.,,,['(c) 2020 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Allogeneic stem cell transplant, the only treatment modality shown to have any beneficial long-term outcome, is often not possible given the advanced age of patients at time of diagnosis and frequent presence of competing comorbidities. Even in this setting, relapse rates remain high. As a result, outcomes are generally poor and there remains a significant unmet need for novel therapeutic strategies.

As a result, in 2016, classification of myeloid neoplasms with germline predisposition for each of these and other genes was added to the World Health Organization guidelines. The incidence of germline mutation carriers in the general population or in various clinically presenting patient groups remains poorly defined for reasons including that somatic mutations in these genes are common in blood cancers, and our ability to distinguish germline (inherited or de novo) and somatic mutations is often limited by the laboratory analyses. Knowledge of the regulation of these TFs and their mutant alleles, their interaction with other genes and proteins and the environment, and how these alter the clinical presentation of patients and their leukemias is also incomplete. Outstanding questions that remain for patients with these germline mutations or their treating clinicians include: What is the natural course of the disease? What other symptoms may I develop and when? Can you predict them? Can I prevent them? and What is the best treatment? The resolution of many of the remaining clinical and biological questions and effective evidence-based treatment of patients with these inherited mutations will depend on worldwide partnerships among patients, clinicians, diagnosticians, and researchers to aggregate sufficient longitudinal clinical and laboratory data and integrate these data with model systems.","['Brown, Anna L', 'Hahn, Christopher N', 'Scott, Hamish S']","['Brown AL', 'Hahn CN', 'Scott HS']","['Department of Genetics and Molecular Pathology, SA Pathology, Adelaide, SA, Australia.', 'Centre for Cancer Biology, SA Pathology and University of South Australia, Adelaide, SA, Australia.', 'Adelaide Medical School, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, SA, Australia; and.', 'Department of Genetics and Molecular Pathology, SA Pathology, Adelaide, SA, Australia.', 'Centre for Cancer Biology, SA Pathology and University of South Australia, Adelaide, SA, Australia.', 'Adelaide Medical School, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, SA, Australia; and.', 'Department of Genetics and Molecular Pathology, SA Pathology, Adelaide, SA, Australia.', 'Centre for Cancer Biology, SA Pathology and University of South Australia, Adelaide, SA, Australia.', 'Adelaide Medical School, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, SA, Australia; and.', 'ACRF Cancer Genomics Facility, Centre for Cancer Biology, SA Pathology, Adelaide, SA, Australia.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins)', '0 (CEBPA protein, human)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (GATA2 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA2 protein, human)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Age of Onset', 'Blood Cell Count', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*genetics', 'Disease Management', 'Early Detection of Cancer', 'Forecasting', 'GATA2 Transcription Factor/*genetics', '*Genes, Neoplasm', 'Genetic Counseling', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', '*Germ-Line Mutation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/epidemiology/*genetics/therapy', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/genetics', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*genetics', 'Penetrance', 'Prognosis']",PMC7332898,,,2020/05/21 06:00,2021/02/18 06:00,['2020/05/21 06:00'],"['2019/09/25 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/18 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/21 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)61914-0 [pii]', '10.1182/blood.2019000937 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2020 Jul 2;136(1):24-35. doi: 10.1182/blood.2019000937.,,,['(c) 2020 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The stromal damage of bone marrow following pre-HSCT conditioning regimens can delay the hematopoietic engraftment and increased blood product transfusions. We tried to define threshold based on pre-transplant platelet count as a biomarker to predict engraftment time and blood product requirements in allogeneic HSCT patients. METHODS: This retrospective study was performed on 194 patients who received allogeneic HSCT. The median for platelet (PLT) count of patients at the admission day was considered as a cut off value. The association of platelet count with white blood cell (WBC) and PLT engraftment time and also the requirement of packed red blood cell or PLT transfusions as outcomes of interest were investigated. RESULTS: 164 patients (84.5 %) had successful WBC engraftment, and PLT engraftment was seen in 155 patients (79.9 %) in 30 and 50 days after HSCT, respectively. The patients with PLT count higher than 154,000/muL had better PLT engraftment (P = 0.060), and WBC engraftment (P = 0.014) than those with PLT count lower than this cut off. The pre-transplant PLT count had negative relations with SD platelet requests after HSCT (P = 0.008). CONCLUSION: The thrombocytopenia before HSCT might delay the platelet and WBC engraftment time, which should be taken into account before transplantation. Since the blood product transfusion is one of the factors associated with engraftment, the pre-transplant platelet count can be used as a predictive biomarker to manage the blood product requirement during the HSCT until engraftment occurs.","['Roshandel, Elham', 'Kaviani, Saeid', 'Hajifathali, Abbas', 'Soleimani, Masoud']","['Roshandel E', 'Kaviani S', 'Hajifathali A', 'Soleimani M']","['Department of Hematology, Tarbiat Modares University, Tehran, Iran.

The cells co-expressing CFP-Mcl-1 and YFP-Bak/BimL/Puma/tBid showed co-localization of Mcl-1 with Bak/Puma/BimL/tBid and also showed the inhibitory action of Mcl-1 on the Bak-, BimL-, Puma- or tBid-mediated cell death. Co-expression of Mcl-1 and Bak but not BH3-only proteins induced time-dependent mitochondrial swelling. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) imaging proved the direct binding of Mcl-1 to Bak, BimL, Puma and tBid, respectively. In addition, Mcl-1 prevented Bak oligomerization by retrotranslocating Bak from mitochondria into cytoplasm. Moreover, Mcl-1-Bak complex exhibited a good co-localization with mitochondria, and co-expression of Mcl-1 and Bak for more than 24 h not only induced mitochondrial swelling but also impaired mitochondrial membrane potential. Collectively, co-expression of Mcl-1 and Bak but not BH3-only proteins significantly induced mitochondrial swelling and subsequent loss of mitochondrial membrane potential.","['Wang, Yong', 'Su, Wenhua', 'Mai, Zihao', 'Du, Mengyan', 'Yu, Si', 'Liu, Yangpei', 'Wang, Xiaopin', 'Chen, Tongshen']","['Wang Y', 'Su W', 'Mai Z', 'Du M', 'Yu S', 'Liu Y', 'Wang X', 'Chen T']","['MOE Key Laboratory & Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Laser Life Science, College of Biophotonics, South China Normal University, Guangzhou, 510631, China.', 'MOE Key Laboratory & Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Laser Life Science, College of Biophotonics, South China Normal University, Guangzhou, 510631, China.', 'MOE Key Laboratory & Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Laser Life Science, College of Biophotonics, South China Normal University, Guangzhou, 510631, China.', 'MOE Key Laboratory & Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Laser Life Science, College of Biophotonics, South China Normal University, Guangzhou, 510631, China.', 'MOE Key Laboratory & Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Laser Life Science, College of Biophotonics, South China Normal University, Guangzhou, 510631, China.', 'MOE Key Laboratory & Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Laser Life Science, College of Biophotonics, South China Normal University, Guangzhou, 510631, China.', 'Department of Pain Management, The First Affiliated Hospital, Jinan University, Guangzhou, 510632, China.

A wealth of occupational epidemiology literature exists around the petrochemical industry, with adverse haematological effects identified in employees exposed to 'low' concentrations of aromatic hydrocarbons (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene). Releases from the petrochemical industry are also thought to increase the risk of cancer incidence in fenceline communities. However, this emerging and at times inconclusive evidence base remains fragmented. The present study's aim was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of epidemiological studies investigating the association between incidences of haematological malignancy and residential exposure to the petrochemical industry. METHODS: Epidemiological studies reporting the risk of haematological malignancies (Leukaemia, Hodgkin's lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and Multiple myeloma) were included where the following criteria were met: (i) Cancer incidence is diagnosed by a medical professional and coded in accordance to the International Classification of Diseases; (ii) A clear definition of fenceline communities is provided, indicating the proximity between exposed residents and petrochemical activities; and (iii) Exposure is representative of normal operating conditions, not emergency events. Two investigators independently extracted information on study characteristics and outcomes in accordance with PRISMA and MOOSE guidelines. Relative risks and their 95% confidence intervals were pooled across studies for the four categories of haematological malignancy, using a random effects meta-analysis. RESULTS: The systematic review identified 16 unique studies, which collectively record the incidence of haematological malignancies across 187,585 residents living close to a petrochemical operation. Residents from fenceline communities, less than 5 km from a petrochemical facility (refinery or manufacturer of commercial chemicals), had a 30% higher risk of developing Leukaemia than residents from communities with no petrochemical activity. Meanwhile, the association between exposure and rarer forms of haematological malignancy remains uncertain, with further research required. CONCLUSIONS: The risk of developing Leukaemia appears higher in individuals living near a petrochemical facility. This highlights the need for further policy to regulate the release of carcinogens by industry.","['Jephcote, Calvin', 'Brown, David', 'Verbeek, Thomas', 'Mah, Alice']","['Jephcote C', 'Brown D', 'Verbeek T', 'Mah A']","['Department of Sociology, University of Warwick, Coventry, CV4 7AL, UK. cj191@leicester.ac.uk.', 'Centre for Environmental Health and Sustainability, University of Leicester, Leicester, LE1 7HA, UK. cj191@leicester.ac.uk.', 'Department of Sociology, University of Warwick, Coventry, CV4 7AL, UK.', 'Department of Sociology, University of Warwick, Coventry, CV4 7AL, UK.', 'Department of Sociology, University of Warwick, Coventry, CV4 7AL, UK.']",['eng'],['639583/H2020 European Research Council/International'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Systematic Review']",20200519,England,Environ Health,Environmental health : a global access science source,101147645,['0 (Air Pollutants)'],IM,"['Air Pollutants/*adverse effects', 'Environmental Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', '*Oil and Gas Industry', 'Residence Characteristics/*statistics & numerical data']",PMC7236944,['NOTNLM'],"['*Cancer', '*Environmental justice', '*Haematological', '*Leukaemia', '*Lymphoma', '*Meta-analysis', '*Myeloma', '*Petrochemical', '*Refinery']",2020/05/21 06:00,2020/10/21 06:00,['2020/05/21 06:00'],"['2019/09/23 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/05/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/21 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12940-020-00582-1 [doi]', '10.1186/s12940-020-00582-1 [pii]']",epublish,Environ Health. 2020 May 19;19(1):53. doi: 10.1186/s12940-020-00582-1.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since BCR-ABL displays abnormal constitutive tyrosine kinase activity, therapies using tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKis) such as imatinib represent a major breakthrough for the outcome of CML patients. Nevertheless, the development of TKi resistance and the persistence of leukemia stem cells (LSCs) remain barriers to cure the disease, justifying the development of novel therapeutic approaches. Since the activity of histone deacetylase (HDAC) is deregulated in numerous cancers including CML, pan-HDAC inhibitors may represent promising therapeutic regimens for the treatment of CML cells in combination with TKi. RESULTS: We assessed the anti-leukemic activity of a novel hydroxamate-based pan-HDAC inhibitor MAKV-8, which complied with the Lipinski's ""rule of five,"" in various CML cells alone or in combination with imatinib. We validated the in vitro HDAC-inhibitory potential of MAKV-8 and demonstrated efficient binding to the ligand-binding pocket of HDAC isoenzymes. In cellulo, MAKV-8 significantly induced target protein acetylation, displayed cytostatic and cytotoxic properties, and triggered concomitant ER stress/protective autophagy leading to canonical caspase-dependent apoptosis. Considering the specific upregulation of selected HDACs in LSCs from CML patients, we investigated the differential toxicity of a co-treatment with MAKV-8 and imatinib in CML versus healthy cells. We also showed that beclin-1 knockdown prevented MAKV-8-imatinib combination-induced apoptosis. Moreover, MAKV-8 and imatinib co-treatment synergistically reduced BCR-ABL-related signaling pathways involved in CML cell growth and survival. Since our results showed that LSCs from CML patients overexpressed c-MYC, importantly MAKV-8-imatinib co-treatment reduced c-MYC levels and the LSC population. In vivo, tumor growth of xenografted K-562 cells in zebrafish was completely abrogated upon combined treatment with MAKV-8 and imatinib. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, the present findings show that combinations HDAC inhibitor-imatinib are likely to overcome drug resistance in CML pathology.","['Lernoux, Manon', 'Schnekenburger, Michael', 'Losson, Helene', 'Vermeulen, Koen', 'Hahn, Hyunggu', 'Gerard, Deborah', 'Lee, Jin-Young', 'Mazumder, Aloran', 'Ahamed, Muneer', 'Christov, Christo', 'Kim, Dong-Wook', 'Dicato, Mario', 'Bormans, Guy', 'Han, Byung Woo', 'Diederich, Marc']","['Lernoux M', 'Schnekenburger M', 'Losson H', 'Vermeulen K', 'Hahn H', 'Gerard D', 'Lee JY', 'Mazumder A', 'Ahamed M', 'Christov C', 'Kim DW', 'Dicato M', 'Bormans G', 'Han BW', 'Diederich M']","['Laboratoire de Biologie Moleculaire et Cellulaire du Cancer, Hopital Kirchberg, 9, rue Edward Steichen, L-2540, Luxembourg, Luxembourg.', 'Laboratoire de Biologie Moleculaire et Cellulaire du Cancer, Hopital Kirchberg, 9, rue Edward Steichen, L-2540, Luxembourg, Luxembourg.', 'Laboratoire de Biologie Moleculaire et Cellulaire du Cancer, Hopital Kirchberg, 9, rue Edward Steichen, L-2540, Luxembourg, Luxembourg.', 'Laboratory for Radiopharmaceutical Research, Department of Pharmaceutical and Pharmacological Sciences, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Department of Pharmacy, College of Pharmacy, Seoul National University, 1 Gwanak-ro, Gwanak-gu, Seoul, 08826, Korea.', 'Laboratoire de Biologie Moleculaire et Cellulaire du Cancer, Hopital Kirchberg, 9, rue Edward Steichen, L-2540, Luxembourg, Luxembourg.', 'Department of Pharmacy, College of Pharmacy, Seoul National University, 1 Gwanak-ro, Gwanak-gu, Seoul, 08826, Korea.', 'Department of Pharmacy, College of Pharmacy, Seoul National University, 1 Gwanak-ro, Gwanak-gu, Seoul, 08826, Korea.', 'Laboratory for Radiopharmaceutical Research, Department of Pharmaceutical and Pharmacological Sciences, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Faculte de Medecine, Universite de Lorraine, Nancy, France.', ""Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, Leukemia Research Institute, the Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea."", 'Laboratoire de Biologie Moleculaire et Cellulaire du Cancer, Hopital Kirchberg, 9, rue Edward Steichen, L-2540, Luxembourg, Luxembourg.', 'Laboratory for Radiopharmaceutical Research, Department of Pharmaceutical and Pharmacological Sciences, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Department of Pharmacy, College of Pharmacy, Seoul National University, 1 Gwanak-ro, Gwanak-gu, Seoul, 08826, Korea. bwhan@snu.ac.kr.', 'Department of Pharmacy, College of Pharmacy, Seoul National University, 1 Gwanak-ro, Gwanak-gu, Seoul, 08826, Korea. marcdiederich@snu.ac.kr.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200519,Germany,Clin Epigenetics,Clinical epigenetics,101516977,"['0 (Beclin-1)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (MYC protein, human)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)']",IM,"['Acetylation/drug effects', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/chemistry/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Beclin-1/genetics', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'Computer Simulation', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress/drug effects', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/chemistry/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Histone Deacetylases/chemistry', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Isoenzymes/chemistry', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/enzymology/pathology', 'Molecular Docking Simulation', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects']",PMC7236970,['NOTNLM'],"['*Apoptosis', '*Autophagy', '*Computational docking', '*Endoplasmic reticulum stress', '*Epigenetic regulation', '*Tyrosine kinase inhibitor']",2020/05/21 06:00,2021/08/17 06:00,['2020/05/21 06:00'],"['2019/10/25 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/05/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/17 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13148-020-00839-z [doi]', '10.1186/s13148-020-00839-z [pii]']",epublish,Clin Epigenetics. 2020 May 19;12(1):69. doi: 10.1186/s13148-020-00839-z.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Folate is used as a targeting molecule and synthesized with DNA strand in forming the folate-overhang DNA complement, and the complement is then separately base-paired onto six sides of the fabricated DNA tetrahedron. Mitoxantrone is used as an anticancer agent and intercalated into the double strands of the folate-overhung DNA tetrahedron for drug loading. The evaluation studies are performed on leukemia BALL-1 and K562 cells. The results demonstrate that the folate-overhung mitoxantrone DNA tetrahedra (approximately 25 nm) are able to target leukemic cells, transport across the nuclei membrane, induce the apoptosis, and enhance the overall efficacy of treating leukemic cells in vitro and in leukemia-bearing mice.

Epigenetically, the catechin has been classified as a DNMTs inhibitor, however, its impact on histone modifications and chromatin structure is still poorly understood. The purpose of this study was to find the impact of EGCG on the histone posttranslational modifications machinery and chromatin remodeling in human endothelial cells of both microvascular (HMEC-1) and vein (HUVECs) origin. We analyzed the methylation and acetylation status of histones (Western blotting), as well as assessed the activity (fluorometric assay kit) and gene expression (qPCR) of the enzymes playing a prominent role in shaping the human epigenome. The performed analyses showed that EGCG increases histone acetylation (H3K9/14ac, H3ac), and methylation of both active (H3K4me3) and repressive (H3K9me3) chromatin marks. We also found that the catechin acts as an HDAC inhibitor in cellular and cell-free models. Additionally, we observed that EGCG affects chromatin architecture by reducing the expression of heterochromatin binding proteins: HP1alpha, HP1gamma. Our results indicate that EGCG promotes chromatin relaxation in human endothelial cells and presents a broad epigenetic potential affecting expression and activity of epigenome modulators including HDAC5 and 7, p300, CREBP, LSD1 or KMT2A.","['Ciesielski, Oskar', 'Biesiekierska, Marta', 'Balcerczyk, Aneta']","['Ciesielski O', 'Biesiekierska M', 'Balcerczyk A']","['Department of Molecular Biophysics, Faculty of Biology and Environmental Protection, University of Lodz, Pomorska 141/143, 90-236 Lodz, Poland.', 'The Bio-Med-Chem Doctoral School of the University of Lodz and Lodz Institutes of the Polish Academy of Sciences, University of Lodz, Banacha 12/16, 90-237 Lodz, Poland.', 'Department of Molecular Biophysics, Faculty of Biology and Environmental Protection, University of Lodz, Pomorska 141/143, 90-236 Lodz, Poland.', 'Department of Molecular Biophysics, Faculty of Biology and Environmental Protection, University of Lodz, Pomorska 141/143, 90-236 Lodz, Poland.']",['eng'],['B1911000000189.01/University of Lodz'],['Journal Article'],20200516,Switzerland,Molecules,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",100964009,"['0 (ATF2 protein, human)', '0 (Activating Transcription Factor 2)', '0 (CBX3 protein, human)', '0 (CBX5 protein, human)', '0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Tea)', '0 (histone H3 trimethyl Lys4)', '107283-02-3 (Chromobox Protein Homolog 5)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', '8R1V1STN48 (Catechin)', 'BQM438CTEL (epigallocatechin gallate)', 'EC 1.14.11.- (Histone Demethylases)', 'EC 1.5.- (KDM1A protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (p300-CBP Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (p300-CBP-associated factor)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (HDAC5 protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (HDAC7 protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)']",IM,"['Acetylation/drug effects', 'Activating Transcription Factor 2/genetics/metabolism', 'Catechin/*analogs & derivatives/isolation & purification/pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatin/chemistry/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Chromobox Protein Homolog 5', 'Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone/genetics/metabolism', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Histone Deacetylases/genetics/metabolism', 'Histone Demethylases/genetics/metabolism', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/genetics/metabolism', 'Histones/*genetics/metabolism', 'Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells/cytology/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Methylation/drug effects', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational/*drug effects', 'Tea/chemistry', 'p300-CBP Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism']",PMC7287656,['NOTNLM'],"['endothelial cells', 'epigallocatechin gallate', 'epigenetics', 'histone acetylation', 'histone methylation']",2020/05/21 06:00,2021/02/13 06:00,['2020/05/21 06:00'],"['2020/04/15 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/13 00:00 [revised]', '2020/05/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/05/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/13 06:00 [medline]']","['molecules25102326 [pii]', '10.3390/molecules25102326 [doi]']",epublish,Molecules. 2020 May 16;25(10). pii: molecules25102326. doi: 10.3390/molecules25102326.,,['The authors declare no conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since chemotherapy is likely to remain the cornerstone of curative treatment of AML, insights in the molecular mechanisms that determine its cytotoxic effects could aid further treatment optimization. To assess which genes and pathways are implicated in tumor drug resistance, we correlated ex vivo drug response data to genome-wide gene expression profiles of 73 primary pediatric AML samples obtained at initial diagnosis. Ex vivo response of primary AML blasts towards cytarabine (Ara C), daunorubicin (DNR), etoposide (VP16), and cladribine (2-CdA) was associated with the expression of 101, 345, 206, and 599 genes, respectively (p < 0.001, FDR 0.004-0.416). Microarray based expression of multiple genes was technically validated using qRT-PCR for a selection of genes. Moreover, expression levels of BRE, HIF1A, and CLEC7A were confirmed to be significantly (p < 0.05) associated with ex vivo drug response in an independent set of 48 primary pediatric AML patients. We present unique data that addresses transcriptomic analyses of the mechanisms underlying ex vivo drug response of primary tumor samples. Our data suggest that distinct gene expression profiles are associated with ex vivo drug response, and may confer a priori drug resistance in leukemic cells. The described associations represent a fundament for the development of interventions to overcome drug resistance in AML, and maximize the benefits of current chemotherapy for sensitive patients.","['Cucchi, David G J', 'Bachas, Costa', 'van den Heuvel-Eibrink, Marry M', 'Arentsen-Peters, Susan T C J M', 'Kwidama, Zinia J', 'Schuurhuis, Gerrit J', 'Assaraf, Yehuda G', 'de Haas, Valerie', 'Kaspers, Gertjan J L', 'Cloos, Jacqueline']","['Cucchi DGJ', 'Bachas C', 'van den Heuvel-Eibrink MM', 'Arentsen-Peters STCJM', 'Kwidama ZJ', 'Schuurhuis GJ', 'Assaraf YG', 'de Haas V', 'Kaspers GJL', 'Cloos J']","['Hematology, Cancer Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam UMC, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, 1081 HV Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Hematology, Cancer Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam UMC, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, 1081 HV Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', ""Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Erasmus MC-Sophia Children's Hospital, 3015 CN Rotterdam, The Netherlands."", 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, 3584 CS Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, 3584 CS Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Hematology, Cancer Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam UMC, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, 1081 HV Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Hematology, Cancer Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam UMC, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, 1081 HV Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'The Fred Wyszkowski Cancer Research, Laboratory, Department of Biology, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, 3200003 Haifa, Israel.', 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, 3584 CS Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, 3584 CS Utrecht, The Netherlands.', ""Emma's Children's Hospital, Amsterdam UMC, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Pediatric Oncology, 1081 HV Amsterdam, The Netherlands."", 'Hematology, Cancer Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam UMC, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, 1081 HV Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['VU 2005-3666, J.C./KWF Kankerbestrijding']",['Journal Article'],20200515,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,,,PMC7281398,['NOTNLM'],"['chemotherapy', 'cladribine', 'cytarabine', 'daunorubicin', 'drug resistance', 'drug response', 'etoposide', 'gene expression', 'pediatric acute myeloid leukemia']",2020/05/21 06:00,2020/05/21 06:01,['2020/05/21 06:00'],"['2020/04/21 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/06 00:00 [revised]', '2020/05/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/05/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/21 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers12051247 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers12051247 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2020 May 15;12(5). pii: cancers12051247. doi: 10.3390/cancers12051247.,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-6706-5464', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5983-6193', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0339-6816', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7716-8475', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9150-8026']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Timing of apheresis is challenging in heavily pretreated patients who suffer from rapid progressive disease and receive T cell impairing medication. METHODS: A total of 75 unstimulated leukaphereses were analyzed including 45 aphereses in patients and 30 in healthy donors. Thereof, 41 adult patients with Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (85%) or acute lymphoblastic leukemia (15%) underwent leukapheresis for CAR-T cell production. RESULTS: Sufficient lymphocytes were harvested from all patients even from those with low peripheral lymphocyte counts of 0.18/nL. Only four patients required a second leukapheresis session. Leukapheresis products contained a median of 98 x 10(8) (9 - 341 x 10(8)) total nucleated cells (TNC) with 38 x 10(8) (4 - 232 x 10(8)) CD3+ T cells. Leukapheresis products from healthy donors as well as from patients in complete remission were characterized by high TNC and CD3+ T lymphocyte counts. CAR-T cell products could be manufactured for all but one patient. CONCLUSIONS: Sufficient yield of lymphocytes for CAR-T cell production is feasible also for patients with low peripheral blood counts. Up to 12-15 L blood volume should be processed in patients with absolute lymphocyte counts </= 1.0/nL.","['Korell, Felix', 'Laier, Sascha', 'Sauer, Sandra', 'Veelken, Kaya', 'Hennemann, Hannah', 'Schubert, Maria-Luisa', 'Sauer, Tim', 'Pavel, Petra', 'Mueller-Tidow, Carsten', 'Dreger, Peter', 'Schmitt, Michael', 'Schmitt, Anita']","['Korell F', 'Laier S', 'Sauer S', 'Veelken K', 'Hennemann H', 'Schubert ML', 'Sauer T', 'Pavel P', 'Mueller-Tidow C', 'Dreger P', 'Schmitt M', 'Schmitt A']","['Department of Internal Medicine V, University Hospital Heidelberg, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Institute of Clinical Transfusion Medicine and Cell Therapy (IKTZ), 89081 Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine V, University Hospital Heidelberg, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine V, University Hospital Heidelberg, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine V, University Hospital Heidelberg, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine V, University Hospital Heidelberg, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine V, University Hospital Heidelberg, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Institute of Clinical Transfusion Medicine and Cell Therapy (IKTZ), 89081 Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine V, University Hospital Heidelberg, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine V, University Hospital Heidelberg, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine V, University Hospital Heidelberg, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine V, University Hospital Heidelberg, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200515,Switzerland,Cells,Cells,101600052,"['0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Biological Products)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (Receptors, Chimeric Antigen)', 'U2I8T43Y7R (axicabtagene ciloleucel)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD19/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Biological Products', 'CD3 Complex/metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive', '*Leukapheresis', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/pathology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/pathology/*therapy', 'Receptors, Chimeric Antigen/*metabolism', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'T-Lymphocytes/*cytology/drug effects', 'Tissue Donors', 'Young Adult']",PMC7290830,['NOTNLM'],"['*CAR T cell', '*CD3 positive lymphocytes', '*apheresis', '*lymphocyte collection']",2020/05/21 06:00,2021/02/25 06:00,['2020/05/21 06:00'],"['2020/04/09 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/09 00:00 [revised]', '2020/05/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/05/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/25 06:00 [medline]']","['cells9051225 [pii]', '10.3390/cells9051225 [doi]']",epublish,Cells. 2020 May 15;9(5). pii: cells9051225. doi: 10.3390/cells9051225.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The objective is to evaluate the long-term efficacy and the occurrence of vascular occlusion with second-generation BCR-ABL TKIs compared with imatinib in patients with CML. Three scientific databases, a clinical registry and abstracts from congress were searched to identify all randomized controlled trials that compared a second-generation BCR-ABL TKI to imatinib in patients with CML. Outcomes extracted were overall survival, major molecular response and complete cytogenetic response, arterial occlusive events and venous thromboembolism. These data were synthesized by odds ratios using a fixed-effect model. This meta-analysis included 4659 participants from 14 trials. Second-generation BCR-ABL TKIs did not improve overall survival compared with imatinib, even at longer follow-up (OR, 1.17 (95% CI, 0.91-1.52)). They improved surrogate biomarkers at 12 and 24 months but increased the risk of arterial occlusion (ORPETO, 2.81 (95% CI, 2.11-3.73)). The long-term benefits of second-generation TKIs are restricted to surrogate outcomes and do not translate into prolonged survival compared to imatinib.

Two Michigan dairy herds with breeding programs designed to increase milk production were utilized in this study. The prevalence of seropositive cows was 32% and 94% in herds 1 and 2, respectively, and neither herd had experienced more than four cases of lymphosarcoma in 10 years. One hundred and twenty-five calves and their dams were tested for antibody to BLV by the radioimmunoprecipitation assay utilizing glycoprotein antigen. Three of 79 calves (3.8%) born to seropositive dams were seropositive prior to colostral ingestion. None of 46 calves born to seronegative dams was seropositive at birth. The percentage of calves born to seropositive dams that were seropositive at birth was 4.7% in herd 1 and 3.4% in herd 2. This is a much lower rate of in utero BLV exposure than reported in previous studies utilizing a herd in which cows were bred for susceptibility to lymphosarcoma. Therefore, in herds seeking to reduce the prevalence of BLV seropositive animals, it should be possible to retain calves from seropositive dams in greater numbers than previously expected.","['Jacobsen, K L', 'Bull, R W', 'Miller, J M', 'Herdt, T H', 'Kaneene, J B']","['Jacobsen KL', 'Bull RW', 'Miller JM', 'Herdt TH', 'Kaneene JB']","['College of Veterinary Medicine, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI 48824 U.S.A.', 'College of Veterinary Medicine, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI 48824 U.S.A.', 'United States Department of Agriculture, Science and Educational Administration, National Animal Disease Center, Ames, IA 50010 U.S.A.', 'College of Veterinary Medicine, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI 48824 U.S.A.', 'College of Veterinary Medicine, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI 48824 U.S.A.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Netherlands,Prev Vet Med,Preventive veterinary medicine,8217463,,IM,,,,,1983/06/01 00:00,1983/06/01 00:01,['2020/05/21 06:00'],"['1982/08/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/21 06:00 [entrez]', '1983/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/06/01 00:01 [medline]']","['0167-5877(83)90031-4 [pii]', '10.1016/0167-5877(83)90031-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Prev Vet Med. 1983 Jun;1(3):265-272. doi: 10.1016/0167-5877(83)90031-4.,,,['Copyright (c) 1983.

We compared the combination of anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG; 4.5 mg/kg) and post-transplant cyclophosphamide (PTCy; 50 mg/kg on day +3 and +4) with other graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) prophylaxis regimens used for these patients. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 159 patients, aged 22-73 (median 56) years, having undergone transplantation for high-risk AML (n = 120) or MDS (n = 39). The donors were matched related (33%), unrelated (55%) and haploidentical (12%). Almost all patients used peripheral blood stem cells. Conditioning was myeloablative (34%) or reduced intensity (66%). ATG + PTCy was used in 69 patients (43%), and other GvHD prophylaxis regimens in 90 patients (57%). RESULTS: Grade III-IV acute GvHD occurred in 4% of the ATG + PTCy patients versus 20% of those using other regimens (p = 0.004), and chronic GvHD in 19% of the ATG + PTCy patients versus 41% of those using other regimens (p = 0.003). Two-year GvHD-free relapse-free survival (GRFS) was 30% with ATG + PTCy versus 18% with other regimens (p = 0.04). Multivariable analysis demonstrated that while ATG + PTCy had no significant influence on overall survival, cumulative incidence of relapse or NRM, there was a significant influence on GRFS in favor of ATG + PTCy (HR = 0.69, 95% CI 0.45-0.99, p = 0.04).

Nucleoside analogs are subject to resistance mechanisms including downregulation of equilibrative nucleoside transporter (ENT1) and deoxycytidine kinase (dCK). KPC34 is a novel phospholipid mimetic that when cleaved by phospholipase C (PLC) liberates gemcitabine monophosphate and a diacylglycerol mimetic that inhibits the classical isoforms of protein kinase C (PKC). KPC34 acts independently of ENT1 and dCK. KPC34 was active against all AML cell lines tested with IC50s in the nanomolar range. Enforced expression of PLC increased response to KPC34 in vivo. In an orthotopic, xenograft model, KPC34 treatment resulted in a significant increase in survival compared to control animals and those treated with high-dose cytarabine. In a PDX model with activated PKC, there was a significant survival benefit with KPC34, and at progression, there was attenuation of PKC activation in the resistant cells. In contrast, KPC34 was ineffective against a syngeneic, orthotopic AML model without activated PKC. However, when cells from that model were forced to express PKC, there were significantly increased sensitivity in vitro and survival benefit in vivo. These data suggest that KPC34 is active against AML and that the presence of activated PKC can be a predictive biomarker.","['Alexander, Peter M', 'Kucera, Gregory L', 'Pladna, Kristin M', 'Pardee, Timothy S']","['Alexander PM', 'Kucera GL', 'Pladna KM', 'Pardee TS']","['Internal Medicine, Section on Hematology and Oncology, Wake Forest Baptist Health, Winston-Salem, NC.', 'Internal Medicine, Section on Hematology and Oncology, Wake Forest Baptist Health, Winston-Salem, NC; Cancer Biology, Comprehensive Cancer Center of Wake Forest University, Winston-Salem, NC.', 'Internal Medicine, Section on Hematology and Oncology, Wake Forest Baptist Health, Winston-Salem, NC.', 'Internal Medicine, Section on Hematology and Oncology, Wake Forest Baptist Health, Winston-Salem, NC; Cancer Biology, Comprehensive Cancer Center of Wake Forest University, Winston-Salem, NC.

The median age at transplantation was 11 years, and the median duration of follow-up was 60 months. The indication for HSCT was bone marrow failure (BMF; cytopenia or aplastic anemia) in 39 patients and myelodysplasia (MDS)/acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) in 13 patients. The donor type was an HLA-matched sibling for 18 patients, an HLA-matched or mismatched relative for 6 patients, and an HLA-matched or mismatched unrelated donor for 28 patients. Preparative regimens for BMF were myeloablative in 13 patients and reduced intensity in 26. At the time of this report, 29 of the 39 patients with BMF were alive, and the 5-year overall survival was 72% (95% confidence interval, 57% to 86%). Graft failure and graft-versus-host disease were the predominant causes of death. Preparative regimens for patients with MDS/AML were myeloablative in 8 and reduced intensity in 5. At the time of this report, only 2 of 13 patients were alive (15%), with relapse the predominant cause of death. Survival after transplantation for SDS-related BMF is better compared with historical reports, but strategies are needed to overcome graft failure and graft-versus-host disease. For SDS- related MDS or AML, transplantation does not extend survival. Rigorous surveillance and novel treatments for leukemia are urgently needed.","['Myers, Kasiani', 'Hebert, Kyle', 'Antin, Joseph', 'Boulad, Farid', 'Burroughs, Lauri', 'Hofmann, Inga', 'Kamble, Rammurti', 'MacMillan, Margaret L', 'Eapen, Mary']","['Myers K', 'Hebert K', 'Antin J', 'Boulad F', 'Burroughs L', 'Hofmann I', 'Kamble R', 'MacMillan ML', 'Eapen M']","[""Division of Blood and Marrow Transplant and Immune Deficiency, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, Ohio."", 'Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research, Department of Medicine, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, Wisconsin.', ""Division of Hematology and Oncology, Dana Farber Cancer Institute at Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts."", 'Division of Pediatrics, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Data Abstraction Department- Clinical Research, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center, Seattle, Washington.', 'Division of Blood and Bone Marrow Transplant, University of Wisconsin Hospital and Clinics, Madison, Wisconsin.', 'Division of Cell and Gene Therapy, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas.', 'Division of Pediatrics-Blood and Marrow Transplant Program, University of Minnesota Blood and Marrow Transplant Program, Minneapolis, Minnesota.', 'Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research, Department of Medicine, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

Targeted therapies against the FLT3 receptor, including small-molecule FLT3 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and anti-FLT3 antibodies, have demonstrated promising preclinical and even clinical efficacy. Yet, even with the current FDA approval for two FLT3 inhibitors, these modalities were unable to cure AML or significantly extend the lives of patients with a common mutation called FLT3-ITD. While FLT3 is a viable target, the approaches to inhibit its activity were inadequate. To develop a new modality for targeting FLT3, our team engineered an alpha-FLT3-A192 fusion protein composed of a single chain variable fragment antibody conjugated with an elastin-like polypeptide. These fusion proteins assemble into multi-valent nanoparticles with excellent stability and pharmacokinetic properties as well as in vitro and in vivo pharmacological activity in cellular and xenograft murine models of AML. In conclusion, alpha-FLT3-A192 fusions appear to be a viable new modality for targeting FLT3 in AML and warrant further preclinical development to bring it into the clinic.","['Park, Mincheol', 'Vaikari, Vijaya Pooja', 'Lam, Albert T', 'Zhang, Yong', 'MacKay, John Andrew', 'Alachkar, Houda']","['Park M', 'Vaikari VP', 'Lam AT', 'Zhang Y', 'MacKay JA', 'Alachkar H']","['Department of Pharmacology and Pharmaceutical Sciences, School of Pharmacy, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA 90089, United States.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacy, School of Pharmacy, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA 90089, United States.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Pharmaceutical Sciences, School of Pharmacy, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA 90089, United States.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Pharmaceutical Sciences, School of Pharmacy, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA 90089, United States; USC Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA 90089, United States; Department of Chemistry, Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA 90089, United States; Research Center for Liver Diseases, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA 90089, United States.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Pharmaceutical Sciences, School of Pharmacy, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA 90089, United States; Department of Ophthalmology, USC Roski Eye Institute, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA 90089, United States; Department of Biomedical Engineering, Viterbi School of Engineering, University of Southern California, United States.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacy, School of Pharmacy, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA 90089, United States; USC Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA 90089, United States.

METHODS: A systematic literature review. PubMed/MEDLINE and Google Scholar databases were searched for all well-documented cases of orbital/ocular adnexal ATLL. RESULTS: Sixteen patients were included in the final analysis. The median age at diagnosis was 47 years (range, 20-85), 9/16 patients (56%) were male, and patients were of Japanese (10/16, 63%), Caribbean (5/16, 31%), or African (1/16, 6%) origin. Proptosis (6/15, 40%) and visual loss (5/15, 33%) were the most common presenting signs. Involvement of adjacent structures was documented in 8 of 16 (50%) patients. All patients had evidence of systemic ATLL, which was identified concurrently with orbital/ocular adnexal disease in 9 of 15 (60%) patients. Management included multi-agent chemotherapy with steroids (9/13, 69%), antivirals (2/13, 15%), biologic agents (4/13, 31%), and umbilical cord blood transplantation (1/13, 8%). Most patients (8/12, 67%) experienced at least partial remission with disease relapse occurring in 6 of 8 patients (75%). The median survival time was 28 months (95% CI, 5.5-50.5 months). CONCLUSIONS: Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma should be considered in the differential diagnosis of orbital and ocular adnexal space-occupying lesions, particularly in male patients from endemic regions. Orbital disease is frequently locally aggressive and presents concurrently with systemic ATLL, highlighting the importance of comprehensive multimodal work-up and multidisciplinary management. Emerging targeted therapies and hematopoietic stem cell transplant may prolong survival.","['Henry, Roger K', 'Bagg, Adam', 'Wu, Connie', 'Eagle, Ralph C Jr', 'Milman, Tatyana']","['Henry RK', 'Bagg A', 'Wu C', 'Eagle RC Jr', 'Milman T']","['Pathology Service, Wills Eye Hospital, Sidney Kimmel Medical College of Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', 'Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, New Brunswick, New Jersey.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, Wills Eye Hospital, Sidney Kimmel Medical College of Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', 'Pathology Service, Wills Eye Hospital, Sidney Kimmel Medical College of Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', 'Pathology Service, Wills Eye Hospital, Sidney Kimmel Medical College of Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', 'Department of Pathology, Sidney Kimmel Medical College of Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Systematic Review']",,United States,Ophthalmic Plast Reconstr Surg,Ophthalmic plastic and reconstructive surgery,8508431,,IM,"['Adult', '*Eye Neoplasms', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', '*Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/diagnosis/therapy', '*Lymphoma', 'Male', '*Orbital Neoplasms/diagnosis/therapy']",,,,2020/05/20 06:00,2021/05/25 06:00,['2020/05/20 06:00'],"['2020/05/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/25 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/20 06:00 [entrez]']","['00002341-202105000-00001 [pii]', '10.1097/IOP.0000000000001695 [doi]']",ppublish,Ophthalmic Plast Reconstr Surg. 2021 May-Jun 01;37(3):201-211. doi: 10.1097/IOP.0000000000001695.,,['The authors have no financial or conflicts of interest to disclose.'],"['Copyright (c) 2021 The American Society of Ophthalmic Plastic and Reconstructive', 'Surgery, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Iron overload is common in this patient group and can impact short-term and long-term nonrelapse mortality. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective observational cohort study. AIMS: To evaluate the effect of iron load on early and late HSCT outcomes in patients with acute leukemia and myelodysplasia to assess the necessity of reducing iron load. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixty patients who underwent HSCT in pediatric stem cell transplantation unit between 2000 and 2012 were evaluated retrospectively. The patients were divided into those with pretransplantation serum ferritin levels above and below the median value of 1299 ng/mL. RESULTS: Forty-two (70%) of the patients were male, mean ages of the low and high ferritin groups were 85.43+/-9.42 and 118.56+/-10.04 months, respectively. Acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) within the first 100 days and acute liver GVHD were significantly more common in the high ferritin group (P<0.011 for both). Ferritin level was not associated with rates of engraftment syndrome, veno-occlusive disease, early/late infection, relapse, or overall and disease-free survival. CONCLUSIONS: In our study, significant result especially in terms of acute liver GVHD, was important to emphasize the need to be more careful in terms of acute liver GVHD risk in early liver pathologies in patients with high levels of ferritin after transplantation. In future large studies may be helpful to explain the relationship between acute liver GVHD and high ferritin levels.","['Kupesiz, Funda Tayfun', 'Hazar, Volkan', 'Eker, Nursah', 'Guler, Elif', 'Yesilipek, M Akif', 'Tuysuz, Gulen', 'Kupesiz, Alphan']","['Kupesiz FT', 'Hazar V', 'Eker N', 'Guler E', 'Yesilipek MA', 'Tuysuz G', 'Kupesiz A']","['Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Clinic, University of Health Sciences Antalya Training and Research Hospital.', 'Pediatric Stem Cell Transplantation Unit, Medical Park Goztepe Hospital.', 'Pediatric Oncology Department, School of Medicine, Marmara University, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Department, School of Medicine, Akdeniz University.', 'Pediatric Stem Cell Transplantation Unit, Medical Park Antalya Hospital, Antalya.', 'Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Department, School of Medicine, Akdeniz University.', 'Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Department, School of Medicine, Akdeniz University.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Observational Study']",,United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '9007-73-2 (Ferritins)']",IM,"['Biomarkers/blood', 'Child', 'Female', 'Ferritins/blood', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Graft vs Host Disease/blood/etiology/*pathology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Iron Overload/blood/etiology/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/pathology/*therapy', 'Liver Diseases/blood/etiology/*pathology', 'Male', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/pathology/*therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/pathology/*therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,,,2020/05/20 06:00,2021/04/13 06:00,['2020/05/20 06:00'],"['2020/05/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/13 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/20 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/MPH.0000000000001829 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2020 Jul;42(5):e315-e320. doi: 10.1097/MPH.0000000000001829.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The authors performed a retrospective study aiming at children admitted to Pediatric Blood Diseases Center with a new diagnosis of AL and received a PICC insertion, collected the clinical materials of all venous thrombosis cases, and analyzed the incidence rate and characteristics in various types of AL. RESULTS: From September 2007 to December 2018, a total of 2423 patients got PICCs at least once, of whom 29 patients experienced thrombosis events and the overall incidence rate of symptomatic VTE after PICC insertion was 1.2%. Deep venous thrombosis accounted for the majority with 75.9%. Seven cases of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis were documented and they all developed in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). No pulmonary embolism was detected. Patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) had an identical risk of thrombosis to patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (1.7% vs. 1.09%, P>0.05). All thrombi in patients with AML were located on the upper extremity, whereas in the ALL group about half of the thromboembolism developed in other locations. There were no statistical differences between patients in different clinical trials of the ALL group (0.7% vs. 1.6%, P>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The incidence rates of symptomatic VTE after PICC placement in children with AL in our center were relatively low and acceptable. For patients with AML, PICC placement plays the most important role in venous thrombosis. However, in patients with ALL, the potential risk factors were more complex.","['Ren, Yuanyuan', 'Chang, Lixian', 'Zhao, Beibei', 'Zhang, Xiaoyan', 'Wan, Yang', 'Zhu, Xiaofan', 'Zhang, Huimin']","['Ren Y', 'Chang L', 'Zhao B', 'Zhang X', 'Wan Y', 'Zhu X', 'Zhang H']","['Pediatric Blood Diseases Center, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Catheterization, Central Venous/*adverse effects', 'Catheterization, Peripheral/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'China/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/pathology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/pathology/*therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Venous Thromboembolism/*epidemiology/etiology']",,,,2020/05/20 06:00,2021/01/01 06:00,['2020/05/20 06:00'],"['2020/05/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/01 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/20 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/MPH.0000000000001832 [doi]', '00043426-202008000-00012 [pii]']",ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2020 Aug;42(6):e407-e409. doi: 10.1097/MPH.0000000000001832.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Adult survivors of childhood ALL are at increased risk of obesity, cardiovascular disease, and other chronic illnesses. We hypothesize that ALL therapy is associated with long-term gut microbiome alterations that contribute to predisposition to chronic medical conditions. We conducted a pilot study to test whether differences can be detected between stool microbiota of pediatric ALL survivors and their siblings. Stool samples were collected from 38 individuals under age 19 who were at least 1 year after completion of therapy for ALL. Stool samples collected from 16 healthy siblings served as controls. 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing was performed on the stool samples. Comparing microbiota of survivors to sibling controls, no statistically significant differences were found in alpha or beta diversity. However, among the top 10 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) from component 1 in sparse partial least squares discriminant analysis (sPLS-DA) with different relative abundance in survivors versus siblings, OTUs mapping to the genus Faecalibacterium were depleted in survivors. Differences in gut microbial composition were found between pediatric survivors of childhood ALL and their siblings. Specifically, the protective Faecalibacterium is depleted in survivors, which is reminiscent of gut microbiota alteration found in adult survivors of childhood ALL and reported in obesity, suggesting that microbiota alterations in pediatric ALL survivors start in childhood and may play a role in predisposition to chronic illness in later years of survivorship.","['Thomas, Ronay', 'Wong, Wendy S W', 'Saadon, Reem', 'Vilboux, Thierry', 'Deeken, John', 'Niederhuber, John', 'Hourigan, Suchitra K', 'Yang, Elizabeth']","['Thomas R', 'Wong WSW', 'Saadon R', 'Vilboux T', 'Deeken J', 'Niederhuber J', 'Hourigan SK', 'Yang E']","['Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Pediatric Specialists of Virginia, Falls Church, Virginia, USA.', 'Inova Translational Medicine Institute, Inova Health Systems, Falls Church, Virginia, USA.', 'Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Pediatric Specialists of Virginia, Falls Church, Virginia, USA.', 'Inova Translational Medicine Institute, Inova Health Systems, Falls Church, Virginia, USA.', 'Inova Schar Cancer Institute, Falls Church, Virginia, USA.', 'Inova Translational Medicine Institute, Inova Health Systems, Falls Church, Virginia, USA.', 'Surgery and Oncology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.', 'Inova Translational Medicine Institute, Inova Health Systems, Falls Church, Virginia, USA.', 'Pediatric Gastroenterology, Pediatric Specialists of Virginia, Falls Church, Virginia, USA.', ""Pediatrics, Inova Children's Hospital, Falls Church, Virginia, USA."", 'Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Pediatric Specialists of Virginia, Falls Church, Virginia, USA.', 'Pediatrics, George Washington University School of Medicine, Washington, DC, USA.', 'Pediatrics, Virginia Commonwealth University School of Medicine Inova Campus, Falls Church, Virginia, USA.']",['eng'],['K23 HD099240/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Video-Audio Media']",20200519,England,Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Pediatric hematology and oncology,8700164,,IM,"['Adolescent', '*Cancer Survivors', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Faecalibacterium/classification/growth & development', 'Feces/*microbiology', 'Female', '*Gastrointestinal Microbiome', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*microbiology/therapy', '*Siblings']",PMC7701956,['NOTNLM'],"['ALL survivors', 'Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'Faecalibacterium', 'microbiome', 'stool microbiota']",2020/05/20 06:00,2021/01/08 06:00,['2020/05/20 06:00'],"['2020/05/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/08 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/20 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/08880018.2020.1759740 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2020 Sep;37(6):475-488. doi: 10.1080/08880018.2020.1759740.

INTRODUCTION: The 1,3,4-thiadiazole, when equipped with other heterocyclic scaffolds, has displayed enhanced anticancer properties. The thiourea, benzothiazole, imidazo[2,1,b][1,3,4]-thiadiazoles are such potential scaffolds with promising anticancer activity. METHODS: A new series of 5-substituted-1,3,4-thiadiazoles linked with phenyl thiourea, benzothiazole and 2,6-disubstituted imidazo[2,1-b][1,3,4]thiadiazole derivatives were synthesized and tested for invitro anticancer activity on various cancer cell lines. RESULTS: The National Cancer Institute's preliminary anticancer screening results showed compounds 4b and 5b having potent antileukemic activity. Compound 4b selectively showed 32 percent lethality on Human Leukemia-60 cell line. The docking studies of the derivatives on aromatase enzyme (Protein Data Bank: 3S7S) have shown reversible interactions at the active site with good docking scores comparable to Letrozole and Exemestane. Furthermore, the selected derivatives were tested for anticancer activity on HeLa cell line based on the molecular docking studies. CONCLUSION: Compounds 4b and 5b showed effective inhibition equivalent to Letrozole. These preliminary biological screening studies have given positive anticancer activity for these new classes of derivatives. An additional research study like the mechanism of action of the anticancer activity of this new class of compounds is necessary. These groundwork studies illuminate a future pathway for research of this class of compounds enabling the discovery of potent antitumor agents.","['Avvaru, Stephen P', 'Noolvi, Malleshappa N', 'More, Uttam A', 'Chakraborty, Sudipta', 'Dash, Ashutosh', 'Aminabhavi, Tejraj M', 'Narayan, Kumar P', 'Sutariya, Vishnu']","['Avvaru SP', 'Noolvi MN', 'More UA', 'Chakraborty S', 'Dash A', 'Aminabhavi TM', 'Narayan KP', 'Sutariya V']","['Department of Pharmacy, Gujarat Technological University, Ahmedabad, India.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Shree Dhanvantary Pharmacy College, Surat, India.', 'Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Shree Dhanvantary Pharmacy College, Surat, India.', 'Radiopharmaceuticals Division, Bhabha Atomic Research Centre, Mumbai, India.', 'Radiopharmaceuticals Division, Bhabha Atomic Research Centre, Mumbai, India.', 'Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Shree Dhanvantary Pharmacy College, Surat, India.', 'Biological Sciences, Birla Institute of Technology & Science-Pilani, Hyderabad, India.', 'Pharmaceutical Analysis, Shree Dhanvantary Pharmacy College, Surat, India.']",['eng'],['35/14/25/2017-BRNS/35240/Board of Research in Nuclear Science (BRNS)'],['Journal Article'],,Netherlands,Med Chem,Medicinal chemistry (Shariqah (United Arab Emirates)),101240303,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzothiazoles)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Thiadiazoles)', 'GYV9AM2QAG (Thiourea)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Benzothiazoles/*chemistry', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chemistry Techniques, Synthetic', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/*chemistry', 'Thiadiazoles/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Thiourea/*chemistry']",,['NOTNLM'],"['1', '1-b][1', '3', '4-thiadiazole', '4]thiadiazole', 'anticancer activity', 'aromatase', 'benzothiazole', 'docking.', 'imidazo[2', 'letrozole']",2020/05/20 06:00,2021/09/04 06:00,['2020/05/20 06:00'],"['2019/11/07 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/29 00:00 [revised]', '2020/02/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/04 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/20 06:00 [entrez]']","['MC-EPUB-106764 [pii]', '10.2174/1573406416666200519085626 [doi]']",ppublish,Med Chem. 2021;17(7):750-765. doi: 10.2174/1573406416666200519085626.,,,"['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.net.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Long non-coding RNA (lncRNAs) colorectal neoplasia differentially expressed (CRNDE) is reported to be involved in the malignant progression in AML. The purpose of the present study is to explore the roles and potential molecular mechanism of CRNDE in the MDR in AML. In our study, we confirmed that the expression of CRNDE was significantly up-regulated in patients with AML, especially in AML patients after adriamycin (ADR)-based chemotherapy. Spearman correlation analysis showed a positive correlation between the levels of CRNDE and MDR1 in AML patients after ADR-based chemotherapy. Moreover, CRNDE was up-regulated in AML cells, especially in ADR-resistant AML cells. Multidrug resistance protein 1 (MDR1)/p-glycoprotein (P-gp) levels were significantly increased in ADR-resistant AML cells, compared with parental AML cells. CRNDE down-regulation inhibited cell proliferation, promoted apoptosis, reduced Ki67 expression and enhanced cleaved caspase-3 expression in AML and ADR-resistant AML cells. In addition, CRNDE knockdown led to down-regulation of P-gp/MDR1, beta-catenin, c-Myc and cyclinD1 expression, and enhanced the drug sensitivity to ADR in ADR-resistant AML cells. In conclusion, knockdown of CRNDE suppresses proliferation and P-gp-mediated MDR in ADR-resistant AML cells via inhibiting the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway, suggesting that repression of CRNDE might be a therapeutic target to reverse MDR of ADR-resistant AML cells.","['Kang, Yiqing', 'Zhang, Suping', 'Cao, Weijie', 'Wan, Dingming', 'Sun, Ling']","['Kang Y', 'Zhang S', 'Cao W', 'Wan D', 'Sun L']","['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Nuo. 1 Jianshe East Road, Zhengzhou 450052, P.R.

Historically, patients with relapsed and/or refractory disease were not considered candidates for aggressive life support strategies including extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support. Case Summary: We report a 4-year-old female with relapsed refractory pre-B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia preparing for chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy with tisagenlecleucel who was admitted with fever and neutropenia. She progressed to refractory septic shock secondary to Escherichia coli bacteremia and required escalation of hemodynamic support to venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation cannulation. She cleared her E. coli bacteremia, was decannulated, subsequently received her chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy, and was declared disease free 1 month from her initial presentation. Conclusion: The ability to provide chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy at designated institutions can augment extracorporeal membrane oxygenation candidacy discussions in oncology patients with relapsed disease and may make extracorporeal membrane oxygenation candidacy for oncology patients with refractory sepsis more favorable.","['Stoner, Alyssa', 'Miller, Jenna O', 'Flatt, Terrie', 'Wallisch, Jessica S']","['Stoner A', 'Miller JO', 'Flatt T', 'Wallisch JS']","[""Division of Pediatric Critical Care Medicine, University of Missouri-Kansas City School of Medicine, and Children's Mercy Hospital, Kansas City, MO."", ""Division of Pediatric Critical Care Medicine, University of Missouri-Kansas City School of Medicine, and Children's Mercy Hospital, Kansas City, MO."", ""Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology/BMT, University of Missouri-Kansas City School of Medicine, and Children's Mercy Hospital, Kansas City, MO."", ""Division of Pediatric Critical Care Medicine, University of Missouri-Kansas City School of Medicine, and Children's Mercy Hospital, Kansas City, MO.""]",['eng'],,['Case Reports'],20200429,United States,Crit Care Explor,Critical care explorations,101746347,,,,PMC7188439,['NOTNLM'],"['chimeric antigen receptor', 'extracorporeal membrane oxygenation', 'leukemia', 'pediatrics', 'sepsis']",2020/05/20 06:00,2020/05/20 06:01,['2020/05/20 06:00'],"['2020/05/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/05/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/20 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1097/CCE.0000000000000093 [doi]'],epublish,Crit Care Explor. 2020 Apr 29;2(4):e0093. doi: 10.1097/CCE.0000000000000093. eCollection 2020 Apr.,,"['The authors have disclosed that they do not have any potential conflicts of', 'interest.']","['Copyright (c) 2020 The Authors.

True hyperkalemia necessitates emergent treatment while pseudohyperkalemia requires recognition to prevent inappropriate treatment. It is imperative that the emergency physician (EP) have an understanding of the causes and clinical presentations of both phenomena. Case Report: We present a case of an 88-year-old male with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and suspected blast crisis who was found to have elevated serum potassium levels without other manifestations of hyperkalemia and eventually was determined to have pseudohyperkalemia due to white cell fragility. Discussion: Differentiation of hyperkalemia and pseudohyperkalemia is a critical skill for the EP. We discuss multiple causes of hyperkalemia and pseudohyperkalemia in an effort to broaden the knowledge base. Conclusion: We present a case of CLL as an unusual cause of pseudohyperkalemia and review common causes of pseudohyperkalemia.,"['Le, Rachel D', 'Geary, Sean P']","['Le RD', 'Geary SP']","['Albany Medical Center Hospital, Department of Emergency Medicine, Albany, New York.', 'Albany Medical Center Hospital, Department of Emergency Medicine and Department of Surgery, Division of Surgical Critical Care, Albany, New York.']",['eng'],,['Case Reports'],20200423,United States,Clin Pract Cases Emerg Med,Clinical practice and cases in emergency medicine,101718968,,,,PMC7220025,['NOTNLM'],"['chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'hyperleukocytosis', 'pseudohyperkalemia']",2020/05/20 06:00,2020/05/20 06:01,['2020/05/20 06:00'],"['2020/01/10 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/14 00:00 [revised]', '2020/03/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/05/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/20 06:01 [medline]']","['10.5811/cpcem.2020.3.46481 [doi]', 'cpcem.2020.3.46481 [pii]']",epublish,Clin Pract Cases Emerg Med. 2020 Apr 23;4(2):208-210. doi: 10.5811/cpcem.2020.3.46481. eCollection 2020 May.,,"['Conflicts of Interest: By the CPC-EM article submission agreement, all authors', 'are required to disclose all affiliations, funding sources and financial or', 'management relationships that could be perceived as potential sources of bias.', 'The authors disclosed none.']",['Copyright: (c) 2020 Le et al.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In many cancer types Sirt1 expression is increased and higher levels have been associated with metastasis and poor prognosis. However, it was also shown, that Sirt1 can have tumor suppressing properties and in some instances even a dual role for the same cancer type has been reported. Increased Sirt1 activity has been linked to extension of the life span of cells, respectively, organisms by promoting DNA repair processes and downregulation of tumor suppressor proteins. This may have the downside of enhancing tumor growth and metastasis. In mice embryonic fibroblasts depletion of Sirt1 was shown to decrease levels of the DNA damage sensor histone H2AX. Impairment of DNA repair mechanisms by Sirt1 can promote tumorigenesis but also lower chemoresistance toward DNA targeting therapies. Despite many biological studies, there is currently just one small molecule Sirt1 inhibitor in clinical trials. Selisistat (EX-527) reached phase III clinical trials for treatment of Huntington's Disease. New small molecule Sirt1 modulators are crucial for further investigation of the contradicting roles of Sirt1 in cancer. We tested a small library of commercially available compounds that were proposed by virtual screening and docking studies against Sirt1, 2 and 3. A thienopyrimidone featuring a phenyl thiocyanate moiety was found to selectively inhibit Sirt1 with an IC50 of 13 muM. Structural analogs lacking the thiocyanate function did not show inhibition of Sirt1 revealing this group as key for the selectivity and affinity toward Sirt1. Further analogs with higher solubility were identified through iterative docking studies and in vitro testing. The most active compounds (down to 5 muM IC50) were further studied in cells. The ratio of phosphorylated gammaH2AX to unmodified H2AX is lower when Sirt1 is depleted or inhibited. Our new Sirtuin 1 inhibiting thiocyanates (S1th) lead to similarly lowered gammaH2AX/H2AX ratios in mouse embryonic fibroblasts as Sirt1 knockout and treatment with the reference inhibitor EX-527. In addition to that we were able to show antiproliferative activity, inhibition of migration and colony forming as well as hyperacetylation of Sirt1 targets p53 and H3 by the S1th in cervical cancer cells (HeLa). These results reveal thiocyanates as a promising new class of selective Sirt1 inhibitors.","['Wossner, Nathalie', 'Alhalabi, Zayan', 'Gonzalez, Jessica', 'Swyter, Soren', 'Gan, Jin', 'Schmidtkunz, Karin', 'Zhang, Lin', 'Vaquero, Alejandro', 'Ovaa, Huib', 'Einsle, Oliver', 'Sippl, Wolfgang', 'Jung, Manfred']","['Wossner N', 'Alhalabi Z', 'Gonzalez J', 'Swyter S', 'Gan J', 'Schmidtkunz K', 'Zhang L', 'Vaquero A', 'Ovaa H', 'Einsle O', 'Sippl W', 'Jung M']","['Department of Pharmaceutical and Medicinal Chemistry, Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Freiburg, Freiburg im Breisgau, Germany.', 'Department of Medicinal Chemistry, Institute of Pharmacy, University of Halle-Wittenberg, Halle, Germany.', 'Chromatin Biology Laboratory, Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute (IJC), Badalona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical and Medicinal Chemistry, Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Freiburg, Freiburg im Breisgau, Germany.', 'Department of Cell and Chemical Biology, Oncode Institute, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, Netherlands.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical and Medicinal Chemistry, Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Freiburg, Freiburg im Breisgau, Germany.', 'Department of Protein Crystallography, Institute of Biochemistry, University of Freiburg, Freiburg im Breisgau, Germany.', 'Chromatin Biology Laboratory, Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute (IJC), Badalona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Department of Cell and Chemical Biology, Oncode Institute, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, Netherlands.', 'Department of Protein Crystallography, Institute of Biochemistry, University of Freiburg, Freiburg im Breisgau, Germany.', 'Department of Medicinal Chemistry, Institute of Pharmacy, University of Halle-Wittenberg, Halle, Germany.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical and Medicinal Chemistry, Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Freiburg, Freiburg im Breisgau, Germany.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200430,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,,PMC7203344,['NOTNLM'],"['DNA damage', 'H2AX', 'histone', 'lysine deacetylase', 'p53', 'sirtuins', 'thiocyanate']",2020/05/20 06:00,2020/05/20 06:01,['2020/05/20 06:00'],"['2019/12/09 00:00 [received]', '2020/04/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/05/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/20 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2020.00657 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2020 Apr 30;10:657. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2020.00657. eCollection 2020.,,,"['Copyright (c) 2020 Wossner, Alhalabi, Gonzalez, Swyter, Gan, Schmidtkunz, Zhang,', 'Vaquero, Ovaa, Einsle, Sippl and Jung.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: A comprehensive search of electronic databases including PubMed, SpringerLink, Embase, Cochrane Library, Elsevier/ScienceDirect, Medline, Orbis, and Web of Science databases from January 1990 to November 2018 for observational epidemiologic studies reporting associations between radiation exposure from CT in childhood and the subsequent risk of cancer was conducted. A linear model was used to explore the dose-response relationship. Results: Seven studies with 1180 987 children enrolled were included. The risk of later cancer was 1.32-fold higher for children exposed to CT than those without exposure. Compared to those not exposed to pediatric CT, the relative risk (RRs) were larger for the higher doses but with wider CIs (RR for 5-10 mGy: 0.90, 95% CI: 0.69-1.12; RR for 10-15 mGy: 1.02, 95% CI: 0.86-1.18; RR for >15 mGy: 1.13, 95% CI: 0.97-1.30), the leukemia risk was higher in exposed children (RR: 1.23, 95% CI: 1.10-1.36), and brain cancer risk was higher in exposed children (RR: 1.54, 95% CI: 0.84-2.45). Conclusions: Our analysis suggested that radiation exposure from CT during childhood is associated with a subsequently elevated risk of cancer. However, caution is needed when interpreting these results because of the heterogeneity among the studies. The findings should be confirmed in further studies with longer follow-up periods.","['Huang, Ruixue', 'Liu, Xiaodan', 'He, Li', 'Zhou, Ping-Kun']","['Huang R', 'Liu X', 'He L', 'Zhou PK']","[""Department of Occupational and Environmental Health, Xiangya School of Public Heath, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan Province, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Radiation Biology, Beijing Key Laboratory for Radiobiology, Beijing Institute of Radiation Medicine, AMMS, Beijing, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Occupational and Environmental Health, Xiangya School of Public Heath, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan Province, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Radiation Biology, Beijing Key Laboratory for Radiobiology, Beijing Institute of Radiation Medicine, AMMS, Beijing, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200505,United States,Dose Response,Dose-response : a publication of International Hormesis Society,101308899,,,,PMC7218306,['NOTNLM'],"['cancer', 'child', 'computed tomography', 'radiation', 'risk']",2020/05/20 06:00,2020/05/20 06:01,['2020/05/20 06:00'],"['2020/01/15 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/09 00:00 [revised]', '2020/04/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/05/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/20 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1177/1559325820923828 [doi]', '10.1177_1559325820923828 [pii]']",epublish,Dose Response. 2020 May 5;18(2):1559325820923828. doi: 10.1177/1559325820923828. eCollection 2020 Apr-Jun.,"['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9280-6551', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5088-9608']","['Declaration of Conflicting Interests: The author(s) declared no potential', 'conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or', 'publication of this article.']",['(c) The Author(s) 2020.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is a radiation protection concept borne from the linear no-threshold (LNT) hypothesis. There are no valid data today supporting the use of LNT in the low-dose range, so dose as a surrogate for risk in radiological imaging is not appropriate, and therefore, the use of the ALARA concept is obsolete. Continued use of an outdated and erroneous principle unnecessarily constrains medical professionals attempting to deliver high-quality care to patients by leading to a reluctance by doctors to order images, a resistance from patients/parents to receive images, subquality images, repeated imaging, increased radiation exposures, the stifling of low-dose radiation research and treatment, and the propagation of radiophobia and continued endorsement of ALARA by regulatory bodies. All these factors result from the fear of radiogenic cancer, many years in the future, that will not occur. It has been established that the dose threshold for leukemia is higher than previously thought. A low-dose radiation exposure from medical imaging will likely upregulate the body's adaptive protection systems leading to the prevention of future cancers. The ALARA principle, as used as a radiation protection principle throughout medicine, is scientifically defunct and should be abandoned.","['Oakley, Paul A', 'Harrison, Deed E']","['Oakley PA', 'Harrison DE']","['Private Practice, Newmarket, Ontario, Canada.', 'CBP NonProfit, Inc, Eagle, ID, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200429,United States,Dose Response,Dose-response : a publication of International Hormesis Society,101308899,,,,PMC7218317,['NOTNLM'],"['ALARA', 'CT scan', 'LNT', 'X-ray', 'low-dose radiation', 'radiation protection']",2020/05/20 06:00,2020/05/20 06:01,['2020/05/20 06:00'],"['2020/01/09 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/31 00:00 [revised]', '2020/04/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/05/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/20 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1177/1559325820921641 [doi]', '10.1177_1559325820921641 [pii]']",epublish,Dose Response. 2020 Apr 29;18(2):1559325820921641. doi: 10.1177/1559325820921641. eCollection 2020 Apr-Jun.,['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3117-7330'],"['Declaration of Conflicting Interests: The author(s) declared the following', 'potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or', 'publication of this article: P.A.O. is a paid research consultant for CBP', 'NonProfit, Inc.; D.E.H. teaches spine rehabilitation methods and sells products', 'to physicians for patient care that require radiography for biomechanical', 'analysis.']",['(c) The Author(s) 2020.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD) positive AML is a type of high-risk AML. Pneumonia is a common complication in patients of AML both due to the disease itself and as a result of induction chemotherapy. Treating AML patients who present with pneumonia is a challenge as induction chemotherapy further increases the severity and mortality of pneumonia as it causes myelosuppression. We report four patients with newly diagnosed FLT3-ITD-positive AML who had pneumonia at presentation. All four cases required induction chemotherapy with 7+3 which could not be given due to their poor general condition, secondary to pneumonia. Therefore, they were given low-intensity therapy, in the form of azacytidine, to prevent further progression of AML while they were recovering from pneumonia and became well enough to tolerate intensive induction chemotherapy. This treatment strategy of using a bridge before intensive chemotherapy was successful in our patients and 3 out 4 achieved documented remission. In our opinion, patients with newly diagnosed FLT3 positive AML with pneumonia can be given low-intensity chemotherapy such as azacytidine until the remission of pneumonia for better patient outcomes.","['Kurmi, Santosh Raut', 'Dayama, Aniruddha', 'Bhargava, Rahul']","['Kurmi SR', 'Dayama A', 'Bhargava R']","['Department of Hematology and BMT, Fortis Memorial Research Institute, Gurgaon, 122002 India.grid.464839.40000 0004 4653 2037', 'Department of Hematology and BMT, Fortis Memorial Research Institute, Gurgaon, 122002 India.grid.464839.40000 0004 4653 2037', 'Department of Hematology and BMT, Fortis Memorial Research Institute, Gurgaon, 122002 India.grid.464839.40000 0004 4653 2037']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20190920,India,Indian J Hematol Blood Transfus,Indian journal of hematology & blood transfusion : an official journal of Indian Society of Hematology and Blood Transfusion,9425818,,,,PMC7229054,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Azacytidine', 'FLT3-ITD', 'Pneumonia']",2020/05/20 06:00,2020/05/20 06:01,['2020/05/20 06:00'],"['2019/07/07 00:00 [received]', '2019/09/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/05/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/20 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1007/s12288-019-01192-9 [doi]', '1192 [pii]']",ppublish,Indian J Hematol Blood Transfus. 2020 Apr;36(2):377-380. doi: 10.1007/s12288-019-01192-9.

The aim of this study was to investigate whether circulating CD34+ cell count is a prognostic marker in intermediate-low risk APL patients. In this study, 76 intermediate-low risk APL patients and 56 age-adjusted healthy volunteers were evaluated. Enumeration of CD34+ cells was investigated before the treatment. A cut-off value of 10 x 10(6)/L CD34+ cells could just distinguish APL patients with adverse prognostic factors from others and may have the power to predict shorter progression-free survival (PFS) and poor prognosis. Higher count of CD34+ cells was usually associated with nonclassical chromosomal translocation, PML/RARalpha gene complex fusion, APL history, chemotherapy-related APL, disease progression, second tumor, extramedullary infiltration, FLT3-ITD positive mutation, atypical morphology, BM promyelocyte CD56/CD34 positive expression, myelofibrosis, PCR-positive PML/RARa gene fusion but FISH-negative, marrow necrosis and shorter PFS. Our results suggest that the level of CD34+ cells can be further the stratification of disease risk, a higher CD34+ cell count may be indicative of inferior survival and serve as an adverse biomarker for intermediate-low risk APL.","['Zhang, Cuiling', 'Dong, Haibo', 'Lin, Yipeng', 'Xu, Peipei', 'Zhou, Rongfu', 'Zeng, Hui']","['Zhang C', 'Dong H', 'Lin Y', 'Xu P', 'Zhou R', 'Zeng H']","[""1Department of Hematology, Drum Tower Hospital, School of Medicine, Nanjing University, Nanjing, 210093 People's Republic of China.grid.41156.370000 0001 2314 964X"", ""1Department of Hematology, Drum Tower Hospital, School of Medicine, Nanjing University, Nanjing, 210093 People's Republic of China.grid.41156.370000 0001 2314 964X"", ""1Department of Hematology, Drum Tower Hospital, School of Medicine, Nanjing University, Nanjing, 210093 People's Republic of China.grid.41156.370000 0001 2314 964X"", ""1Department of Hematology, Drum Tower Hospital, School of Medicine, Nanjing University, Nanjing, 210093 People's Republic of China.grid.41156.370000 0001 2314 964X"", ""1Department of Hematology, Drum Tower Hospital, School of Medicine, Nanjing University, Nanjing, 210093 People's Republic of China.grid.41156.370000 0001 2314 964X"", ""1Department of Hematology, Drum Tower Hospital, School of Medicine, Nanjing University, Nanjing, 210093 People's Republic of China.grid.41156.370000 0001 2314 964X"", ""2Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Drum Tower Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School, Nanjing, 210008 People's Republic of China.grid.428392.60000 0004 1800 1685""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20191217,India,Indian J Hematol Blood Transfus,Indian journal of hematology & blood transfusion : an official journal of Indian Society of Hematology and Blood Transfusion,9425818,,,,PMC7229103,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute promyelocytic leukemia', 'Circulating CD34+ cell count', 'Peripheral blood', 'Prognostic factor', 'Progression-free survival']",2020/05/20 06:00,2020/05/20 06:01,['2020/05/20 06:00'],"['2019/07/28 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/05/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/20 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1007/s12288-019-01232-4 [doi]', '1232 [pii]']",ppublish,Indian J Hematol Blood Transfus. 2020 Apr;36(2):309-315. doi: 10.1007/s12288-019-01232-4.

There is paucity of data on MRD and outcome in ALL from India. We share our experience in establishing a flow cytometry-based MRD assay for ALL with emphasis on determination of the number of patients who had MRD on day 35 of induction therapy and its correlation with outcome and other prognostic factors. We prospectively studied MRD in patients with ALL less than 25 years who achieved morphological complete remission with induction therapy. The initial series consisted of 104 patients with ALL. Ninety-two patients had bone marrow samples collected on day 35 of remission induction chemotherapy that was adequate for MRD. Strategy of monitoring MRD was based on flow cytometry using six color staining according the leukemia associated immunophenotype found at diagnosis. Data analysis was done using Fisher exact test. The median age was 8.5 years (range 0.9-22 years). Thirty-seven out of ninety-two patients (40.2%) had MRD at end of induction. MRD on day 35 was between 0.01 and 0.1% in 18.9% of patients, between 0.1 and 1% in 59.5% and more than 1% in 21.6% patients. Among the patients who had MRD, 16.7% had favourable cytogenetics, 60% had intermediate and 13.3% had high-risk cytogenetics. The presence or absence of residual leukemia by flow cytometry at day 35 was not significantly related to age (p = 1.0), male gender (p = 0.08) hyperleukocytosis (p = 0.25) or day 8 blast clearance (p = 0.21). However, T cell phenotype (p < 0.001) was significantly associated with MRD. The 5-year event free survival (EFS) for patients who had MRD versus those who did not was 69% and 61.1% respectively (p = 0.41). The 5-year overall survival (OS) for patients who had MRD versus those who did not was 72.5% and 61.1% respectively (p = 0.33). Flow cytometric techniques can be applied to monitor MRD in patients of ALL undergoing induction therapy. Our results suggest MRD correlates with certain known prognostic factors. Though the EFS and OS was lower in MRD positive patients, the results were not statistically significant probably because of the small sample size.","['Panda, Soumya Surath', 'Radhakrishnan, Venkatraman', 'Ganesan, Prasanth', 'Rajendranath, Rejiv', 'Ganesan, Trivadi S', 'Rajalekshmy, Kamalalayan Raghavan', 'Bhola, Rajesh Kumar', 'Das, Hemlata', 'Sagar, Tenali Gnana']","['Panda SS', 'Radhakrishnan V', 'Ganesan P', 'Rajendranath R', 'Ganesan TS', 'Rajalekshmy KR', 'Bhola RK', 'Das H', 'Sagar TG']","['2Department of Medical Oncology, IMS and SUM Hospital, Siksha O Anusandhan University, Bhubaneswar, Odisha India.grid.412612.20000 0004 1760 9349', '1Departments of Medical Oncology, Cancer Institute (WIA), Adyar, Chennai, Tamil Nadu 600020 India.grid.418600.b', '1Departments of Medical Oncology, Cancer Institute (WIA), Adyar, Chennai, Tamil Nadu 600020 India.grid.418600.b', '1Departments of Medical Oncology, Cancer Institute (WIA), Adyar, Chennai, Tamil Nadu 600020 India.grid.418600.b', '1Departments of Medical Oncology, Cancer Institute (WIA), Adyar, Chennai, Tamil Nadu 600020 India.grid.418600.b', '1Departments of Medical Oncology, Cancer Institute (WIA), Adyar, Chennai, Tamil Nadu 600020 India.grid.418600.b', '2Department of Medical Oncology, IMS and SUM Hospital, Siksha O Anusandhan University, Bhubaneswar, Odisha India.grid.412612.20000 0004 1760 9349', '2Department of Medical Oncology, IMS and SUM Hospital, Siksha O Anusandhan University, Bhubaneswar, Odisha India.grid.412612.20000 0004 1760 9349', '1Departments of Medical Oncology, Cancer Institute (WIA), Adyar, Chennai, Tamil Nadu 600020 India.grid.418600.b']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20191109,India,Indian J Hematol Blood Transfus,Indian journal of hematology & blood transfusion : an official journal of Indian Society of Hematology and Blood Transfusion,9425818,,,,PMC7229125,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'Flow cytometry', 'Minimal residual disease']",2020/05/20 06:00,2020/05/20 06:01,['2020/05/20 06:00'],"['2019/09/01 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/05/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/20 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1007/s12288-019-01228-0 [doi]', '1228 [pii]']",ppublish,Indian J Hematol Blood Transfus. 2020 Apr;36(2):300-308. doi: 10.1007/s12288-019-01228-0.

There is a constant need for additional molecular markers that will help in substratification into more precise prognostic groups. One of the potential new markers is Ecotropic viral integration 1 site (EVI1) transcriptional factor, whose expression is dissregulated in abnormal hematopoietic process. The purpose of this study was to examine EVI1 gene expression in 104 adult AML-NK patients and on 10 healthy bone marrow donors using real-time polymerase chain reaction method, and to evaluate association between EVI1 expression level and other molecular and clinical features, and to examine its potential influence on the prognosis of the disease. Overexpression of EVI1 gene (EVI1 (+) status) was present in 17% of patients. Increased EVI1 expression was predominantly found in patients with lower WBC count (P = 0.003) and lower bone marrow blast percentage (P = 0.005). EVI1 (+) patients had lower WT1 expression level (P = 0.041), and were negative for FLT3-ITD and NPM1 mutations (P = 0.036 and P = 0.003). Patients with EVI1 (+) status had higher complete remission rate (P = 0.047), but EVI1 expression didn't influence overall and disease free survival. EVI1 expression status alone, cannot be used as a new marker for more precise substratification of AML-NK patients. Further investigations conducted on larger number of patients may indicate how EVI1 expression could influence the prognosis and outcome of AML-NK patients, by itself, or in the context of other molecular and clinical parameters.","['Marjanovic, Irena', 'Karan-Djurasevic, Teodora', 'Kostic, Tatjana', 'Virijevic, Marijana', 'Suvajdzic-Vukovic, Nada', 'Pavlovic, Sonja', 'Tosic, Natasa']","['Marjanovic I', 'Karan-Djurasevic T', 'Kostic T', 'Virijevic M', 'Suvajdzic-Vukovic N', 'Pavlovic S', 'Tosic N']","['1Laboratory for Molecular Biomedicine, Institute for Molecular Genetics and Genetic Engineering, University of Belgrade, Vojvode Stepe 444a, 11010 Belgrade, Serbia.grid.7149.b0000 0001 2166 9385', '1Laboratory for Molecular Biomedicine, Institute for Molecular Genetics and Genetic Engineering, University of Belgrade, Vojvode Stepe 444a, 11010 Belgrade, Serbia.grid.7149.b0000 0001 2166 9385', '1Laboratory for Molecular Biomedicine, Institute for Molecular Genetics and Genetic Engineering, University of Belgrade, Vojvode Stepe 444a, 11010 Belgrade, Serbia.grid.7149.b0000 0001 2166 9385', '2Clinic of Hematology, Clinical Center of Serbia, Belgrade, Serbia.grid.418577.80000 0000 8743 1110', '3School of Medicine, University of Belgrade, Belgrade, Serbia.grid.7149.b0000 0001 2166 9385', '2Clinic of Hematology, Clinical Center of Serbia, Belgrade, Serbia.grid.418577.80000 0000 8743 1110', '3School of Medicine, University of Belgrade, Belgrade, Serbia.grid.7149.b0000 0001 2166 9385', '1Laboratory for Molecular Biomedicine, Institute for Molecular Genetics and Genetic Engineering, University of Belgrade, Vojvode Stepe 444a, 11010 Belgrade, Serbia.grid.7149.b0000 0001 2166 9385', '1Laboratory for Molecular Biomedicine, Institute for Molecular Genetics and Genetic Engineering, University of Belgrade, Vojvode Stepe 444a, 11010 Belgrade, Serbia.grid.7149.b0000 0001 2166 9385']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20191104,India,Indian J Hematol Blood Transfus,Indian journal of hematology & blood transfusion : an official journal of Indian Society of Hematology and Blood Transfusion,9425818,,,,PMC7229130,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'EVI1 expression', 'Normal karyotype', 'Prognosis']",2020/05/20 06:00,2020/05/20 06:01,['2020/05/20 06:00'],"['2019/07/22 00:00 [received]', '2019/10/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/05/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/20 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1007/s12288-019-01227-1 [doi]', '1227 [pii]']",ppublish,Indian J Hematol Blood Transfus. 2020 Apr;36(2):292-299. doi: 10.1007/s12288-019-01227-1.

The analysis of the gene expression is applicable for determination of risk stratification and prognosis of cancers. c-MYC, P14(ARF), MDM2, and P53 play a vital role in cell survival through a functional network. This study aimed to investigate the expression of these genes, also their correlation with immunophenotypic subtypes of ALL and the percentage of blasts. Real-time PCR was performed for the expression analysis of P53, MDM2, c-MYC, and P14(ARF) in the bone marrow or peripheral blood samples of 52 ALL patients and 13 normal samples as controls. The morphological analysis and flow cytometry were carried out to examine the phenotypes and percentage of lymphoblasts. The decreased expression levels of P53 and MDM2 were seen in ALL patients compared with control group. In T cell subgroup of ALL the expression of P14(ARF) gene was more decreased among other subgroups. The expression of MDM2 was decreased in ALL patients who were under the age of 16. Based on our study, the interaction between P53 and MDM2 might be more complex and different from reports published in previous studies. Our findings showed that MDM2 is not negatively correlated with P53, at least in our samples. It can be very effective on the current and future studies to use different techniques for analysis of genome, transcriptome, and proteome in definitive risk stratification and prognosis determination.","['Allahbakhshian Farsani, Mehdi', 'Rafiee, Mohammad', 'Aghaee Nezhad, Hamideh', 'Salari, Sina', 'Gharehbaghian, Arshia', 'Mohammadi, Mohammad Hossein']","['Allahbakhshian Farsani M', 'Rafiee M', 'Aghaee Nezhad H', 'Salari S', 'Gharehbaghian A', 'Mohammadi MH']","['1Department of Hematology and Blood Banking, School of Allied Medical Sciences, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.grid.411600.2', '1Department of Hematology and Blood Banking, School of Allied Medical Sciences, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.grid.411600.2', '1Department of Hematology and Blood Banking, School of Allied Medical Sciences, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.grid.411600.2', '2Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Taleghani Hospital, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.grid.411600.2', '3School of Biology, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran.grid.46072.370000 0004 0612 7950', '1Department of Hematology and Blood Banking, School of Allied Medical Sciences, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.grid.411600.2', 'Department of Hematology and Blood Banking, Shahid Beheshti Paramedical School, Darband St, Tehran, Iran.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20191016,India,Indian J Hematol Blood Transfus,Indian journal of hematology & blood transfusion : an official journal of Indian Society of Hematology and Blood Transfusion,9425818,,,,PMC7229094,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'Gene expression', 'MDM2', 'P14ARF', 'P53', 'c-MYC']",2020/05/20 06:00,2020/05/20 06:01,['2020/05/20 06:00'],"['2019/05/15 00:00 [received]', '2019/10/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/05/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/20 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1007/s12288-019-01214-6 [doi]', '1214 [pii]']",ppublish,Indian J Hematol Blood Transfus. 2020 Apr;36(2):277-283. doi: 10.1007/s12288-019-01214-6.

Five to nine selected mutations could identify and track leukemic clones prior to clinical relapse in 10/10 patients at the time-points where measurable residual disease was negative by multicolor flow cytometry. In the non-relapsing patients, the load of mutations gradually declined in response to different therapeutic strategies. Three distinct patterns of relapse were observed: (1) one or more different clones with all monitored mutations reappearing at relapse; (2) one or more separate clones of which one prevailed at relapse; and (3) persistent clonal hematopoiesis with high variant allele frequency and most mutations present at relapse. These pilot results demonstrate that IBSAFE analyses detect leukemic clones missed by flow cytometry with possible clinical implications.HighlightsThe IBSAFE ddPCR MRD method seems applicable on virtually all newly diagnosed AML patients and was more sensitive than flow cytometry.Monitoring a few mutations captured the kinetics of the evolving recurrent leukemia.NPM1-mutation alone may not be a reliable MRD-marker.","['Pettersson, Louise', 'Chen, Yilun', 'George, Anthony M', 'Rigo, Robert', 'Lazarevic, Vladimir', 'Juliusson, Gunnar', 'Saal, Lao H', 'Ehinger, Mats']","['Pettersson L', 'Chen Y', 'George AM', 'Rigo R', 'Lazarevic V', 'Juliusson G', 'Saal LH', 'Ehinger M']","['Department of Pathology, Halland Hospital Halmstad, Region Halland, Halmstad, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical Sciences, Division of Pathology, Lund University, Skane University Hospital, Lund, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical Sciences, Division of Oncology, Faculty of Medicine, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical Sciences, Division of Oncology, Faculty of Medicine, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical Sciences, Division of Oncology, Faculty of Medicine, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Radiation Physics, Lund University, Skane University Hospital, Lund, Sweden.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Radiation Physics, Lund University, Skane University Hospital, Lund, Sweden.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Stem Cell Center, Lund University, Skane University Hospital, Lund, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical Sciences, Division of Oncology, Faculty of Medicine, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Lund University Cancer Center, Medicon Village, Lund, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical Sciences, Division of Pathology, Lund University, Skane University Hospital, Lund, Sweden.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200519,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,IM,"['Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/genetics', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm, Residual/genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Recurrence', 'Whole Exome Sequencing']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*AML', '*MRD', '*clonal patterns', '*ddPCR', '*genetic evolution', '*subclones']",2020/05/20 06:00,2021/04/28 06:00,['2020/05/20 06:00'],"['2020/05/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/28 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/20 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10428194.2020.1755855 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2020 Sep;61(9):2168-2179. doi: 10.1080/10428194.2020.1755855.

Bilateral vocal fold palsy (VFP) is a rare but life-threatening complication of VCR. We report 2 patients with hepatoblastoma presenting with stridor following VCR treatment and propose a management plan. METHODS: Electronic medical records of oncology patients treated at a tertiary hospital with VCR-induced VFP were reviewed. Literature review was performed in PubMed using the terms: hoarseness, VFP, stridor, vincristine. RESULTS: A total of 23 children with VCR-induced VFP were identified from the literature review and adding on our 2 cases. Seventeen (77.3%) were male and 5 (22.7%) were female. The median presenting age was 36.0 months (5-204 months). Acute lymphoblastic leukemia, 15 of 23 (65.2%), was the most common malignancy. Eighteen patients (78.3%) had bilateral VFP and 5 (21.7%) had unilateral VFP. The mean time to VF function recovery was 167.3 days (median: 200.5 days, range: 7-270 days) in the intervention group versus 72.1 days (median: 31.5 days, range: 3-240 days) in the conservative group. One patient in the intervention group had persistent VFP. Sixteen patients (69.6%) were observed, 4 (17.4%) underwent tracheostomy, 1 (4.35%) was intubated, 1 (4.35%) underwent cordectomy, and 1 (4.35%) required positive pressure support. Vincristine was restarted in 12 patients (54.5%), of which 4 developed recurrence of airway symptoms and had to stop VCR. CONCLUSION: A new-onset hoarseness or stridor in a child on VCR should raise the suspicions of VFP. The assumption of an upper respiratory-induced hoarseness or stridor should be avoided. Decisions regarding readministration of VCR and possible airway interventions should be made via a multidisciplinary team approach.","['Tay, Sok Yan', 'Foster, Jennifer', 'Heczey, Andras', 'Sitton, Matthew']","['Tay SY', 'Foster J', 'Heczey A', 'Sitton M']","[""Department of Pediatric Otolaryngology, Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, TX, USA."", ""Texas Children's Hospital, Section of Oncology-Hematology, Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA."", ""Texas Children's Hospital, Section of Oncology-Hematology, Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA."", ""Department of Pediatric Otolaryngology, Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, TX, USA.""]",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",20200519,United States,Ear Nose Throat J,"Ear, nose, & throat journal",7701817,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*adverse effects', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Hepatoblastoma/*drug therapy', 'Hoarseness/etiology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Liver Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'Respiratory Sounds/etiology', 'Vincristine/*adverse effects', 'Vocal Cord Paralysis/*chemically induced']",,['NOTNLM'],"['airway', 'hoarseness', 'malignancy', 'stridor', 'vincristine', 'vocal cord palsy']",2020/05/20 06:00,2021/12/30 06:00,['2020/05/20 06:00'],"['2020/05/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/30 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/20 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/0145561320924868 [doi]'],ppublish,Ear Nose Throat J. 2021 Dec;100(10):NP459-NP463. doi: 10.1177/0145561320924868.

The search for new sources of this enzyme has become attractive for therapeutics. Traditional methods for biomolecule purification involve several steps. A two-phase system may be a good strategy to anticipate one of these stages. This study aimed to produce and purify a fungal L-asparaginase through an aqueous two-phase micellar system (ATPMS) using Triton X-114. The fungus Penicillium sp.-encoded 2DSST1 was isolated from Cerrado soil. Plackett-Burman design followed by a 2(4) full factorial design was used to determine the best conditions to produce L-asparaginase. The evaluated variables were L-asparagine, L-proline, wheat bran, potato dextrose broth, ammonium sulfate, yeast extract, sucrose and glucose concentrations, incubation temperature, incubation period, and initial pH of the culture medium. L-asparaginase quantification was valued by the formation of beta-aspartyl hydroxamate. The significant positive variables, L-asparagine, L-proline, potato dextrose broth, and sucrose concentrations, were evaluated at 2 levels (+ 1 and - 1) with triplicate of the central point. After 34 runs, maximum activity (2.33 IU/mL) was achieved at the factorial design central point. A central composite design was performed in ATPMS at two levels (+ 1 and - 1) varying Triton X-114 concentration (w/v), separation phase temperature, and crude extract concentration (w/v). The L-asparaginase partition coefficient (K) was considered the experimental design response.

AIMS: This study aims to evaluate differences in survival for AYA patients when compared with paediatric patients treated in Ireland over a 20-year time period. METHODS: This study compares relative survival for patients diagnosed in Ireland at ages 0-15 (paediatric group) and 16-24 (AYA group) during 1994-2013, followed to the end of 2014, for cancers defined by the International Classification of Childhood Cancer (ICCC) (Third Edition) group or subgroup. Five-year relative survival estimates, and excess hazard ratios (EHR) comparing excess mortality associated with a cancer diagnosis among AYA with that in the paediatric group, are presented. This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors. RESULTS: Significantly higher excess mortality was found for AYA with leukaemias, lymphomas, astrocytomas, malignant bone tumours, and Ewing and related bone sarcomas, soft tissue sarcomas and 'other/unspecified' epithelial cancers, rhabdomyosarcomas, and 'other and unspecified' carcinomas. In contrast, lower excess mortality was found in the AYA group for all cancers and intracranial/intraspinal tumours, and for gliomas other than astrocytomas or ependymomas. Comparing 1994-2003 and 2004-2013 cohorts, age-related survival differences narrowed for lymphoid leukaemias, but widened for all cancers combined and intracranial/intraspinal tumours combined. Centralization of services varied depending upon cancer subtype, with leukaemias, CNS tumours and bone sarcomas most centralized. Within these, improvements in survival for leukaemias and CNS tumours have been seen for the AYA population. CONCLUSIONS: Reasons for age-related survival differences, and differences in time-trend by age group, are not clear. The significant narrowing of survival differences by age in more recent years for lymphoid leukaemias reflects a more marked recent increase in survival among AYA. More work is required to explain and improve other age-related survival differences.","['Alken, Scheryll', 'Owens, Cormac', 'Gilham, Charles', 'Grant, Cliona', 'Pears, Jane', 'Deady, Sandra', ""O'Marcaigh, Aengus"", 'Capra, Michael', ""O'Mahony, Deirdre"", 'Smith, Owen', 'Walsh, Paul M']","['Alken S', 'Owens C', 'Gilham C', 'Grant C', 'Pears J', 'Deady S', ""O'Marcaigh A"", 'Capra M', ""O'Mahony D"", 'Smith O', 'Walsh PM']","[""St James's Hospital, Dublin, Ireland. salken@stjames.ie."", ""Children's Health Ireland, Crumlin, Dublin, Ireland. salken@stjames.ie."", ""Children's Health Ireland, Crumlin, Dublin, Ireland."", ""St Luke's Radiation Oncology Network, Rathgar, Dublin, Ireland."", ""St James's Hospital, Dublin, Ireland."", ""Children's Health Ireland, Crumlin, Dublin, Ireland."", 'National Cancer Registry Ireland, Cork, Ireland.', ""Children's Health Ireland, Crumlin, Dublin, Ireland."", ""Children's Health Ireland, Crumlin, Dublin, Ireland."", 'Bons Secours Hospital, Cork, Ireland.', ""Children's Health Ireland, Crumlin, Dublin, Ireland."", 'National Cancer Registry Ireland, Cork, Ireland.']",['eng'],,"['Historical Article', 'Journal Article']",20200518,Ireland,Ir J Med Sci,Irish journal of medical science,7806864,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Factors', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'History, 20th Century', 'History, 21st Century', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Ireland', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*mortality', 'Survival Analysis', 'Time Factors', 'Young Adult']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Adolescent and young adult', 'Child', 'Ireland', 'Leukaemia', 'Oncology', 'Sarcoma']",2020/05/20 06:00,2020/12/15 06:00,['2020/05/20 06:00'],"['2020/04/08 00:00 [received]', '2020/04/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/15 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/20 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s11845-020-02236-0 [doi]', '10.1007/s11845-020-02236-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Ir J Med Sci. 2020 Nov;189(4):1223-1236. doi: 10.1007/s11845-020-02236-0.

Here, we performed proteomic analysis of Rpn13 inhibitor (RA190)-treated MM cells and identified an antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase (SOD1) as a mediator of Rpn13 signaling. SOD1 levels are higher in MM patient cells versus normal PBMCs; and importantly, SOD1 expression correlates with the progression of disease and shorter survival. Functional validation studies show that RA190-induced cytotoxicity in bortezomib-sensitive and -resistant MM cells is associated with decrease in SOD1 levels; conversely, forced expression of SOD1 inhibits RA190-induced cell death. Genetic knockdown and biochemical blockade of SOD1 with LCS-1 sensitizes bortezomib-resistant MM cells to bortezomib. SOD1 inhibitor LCS-1 decreases viability in MM cell lines and patient cells. LCS-1-induced cell death is associated with: (1) increase in superoxide and ROS levels; (2) activation of caspases, and p53/p21 signaling; (3) decrease in MCL-1, BCLxL, CDC2, cyclin-B1, and c-Myc; (4) ER stress response; and (5) inhibition of proteasome function. In animal model studies, LCS-1 inhibits xenografted bortezomib-resistant human MM cell growth and prolongs host survival. Our studies therefore show that targeting Rpn13 overcomes bortezomib resistance by decreasing cellular SOD1 levels, and provide the rationale for novel therapeutics targeting SOD1 to improve patient outcome in MM.","['Du, Ting', 'Song, Yan', 'Ray, Arghya', 'Chauhan, Dharminder', 'Anderson, Kenneth C']","['Du T', 'Song Y', 'Ray A', 'Chauhan D', 'Anderson KC']","['Department of Medical Oncology, LeBow Institute for Myeloma Therapeutics and Jerome Lipper Myeloma Center, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, LeBow Institute for Myeloma Therapeutics and Jerome Lipper Myeloma Center, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, LeBow Institute for Myeloma Therapeutics and Jerome Lipper Myeloma Center, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, LeBow Institute for Myeloma Therapeutics and Jerome Lipper Myeloma Center, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.

This result suggested that, at least, a fraction of human AMLs could be due to a similar mechanism. We analyzed the role of the two miR-15/16 clusters in 93 myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients divided in three subgroups: patients with MDS, patients with MDS before transforming into AML (MDS-T), and patients with AML evolving from MDS (MDS-AML). Then, we tested 139 AML cases and 14 different AML cell lines by assessing microRNA (miRNA) expression, target protein expression, genetic loss, and silencing. MDS-T and MDS-AML patients show a reduction of the expression of miR-15a/-15b/-16 compared to MDS patients. Each miRNA can significantly predict MDS and MDS-T groups. Then, 79% of primary AMLs show a reduced expression of miR-15a and/or miR-15b. The expression of miR-15a/-15b/-16 significantly stratified AML patients in two prognostic classes. Furthermore, 40% of AML cell lines showed a combined loss of the expression of miR-15a/-15b and overexpression of their direct/indirect targets. As potential mechanisms involved in the silencing of the two miR-15/16 loci, we identified a genetic loss of miR-15a and miR-15b and silencing of these two loci by methylation.

Our present study aimed to explore the exact roles of lncRNA LINC00909 (LINC00909) in the progression of pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and to study the potential molecular mechanism. In this study, the levels of LINC00909 were observed to be distinctly upregulated in AML patients and cell lines. Higher levels of LINC00909 were associated with FAB classification, cytogenetics and poorer prognosis. Functionally, knockdown of LINC00909 suppressed cell viabilities, migration and invasion, and promoted apoptosis of NB4 and HL-60 cells. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that LINC00909 functioned as a molecular sponge for miR-625. In addition, we observed that Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway was suppressed by LINC00909 knockdown. Moreover, miR-625 levels were dramatically decreased in AML cells when Wnt/beta-catenin signaling was activated. Overall, our findings identified a new AML-related lncRNA LINC00909 which may represent a novel biomarker and a potential therapeutic target of AML.","['Ma, Lei', 'Wang, Yan-Yan', 'Jiang, Peng']","['Ma L', 'Wang YY', 'Jiang P']","[""Department of Pediatrics, Liaocheng People's Hospital, Liaocheng, 252000, Shandong, China."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Liaocheng People's Hospital, Liaocheng, 252000, Shandong, China."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Liaocheng People's Hospital, Liaocheng, 252000, Shandong, China.

However, the possible regulation mechanisms underlying miR-29b/29c-3p in T-ALL have not been interrogated yet. The aim of our study was to probe the association and possible molecular mechanism of miR-29b/29c-3p and Glutathione Peroxidase 1 (GPX1), a predicted highly expressed gene in acute myeloid leukemia (LAML) tissues on the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) website. In our paper, it was observed that GPX1 was relatively overexpressed in T-ALL cells, compared with normal T cells. Loss-of-function assays demonstrated that GPX1 knockdown inhibited the proliferation and activated the apoptosis in T-ALL cells. Then miR-29b/29c-3p was confirmed to regulate GPX1 mRNA and protein expression via decreasing Transcription Factor AP-2 Gamma (TFAP2C) expression. In summary, miR-29b-3p and miR-29c-3p targeted TFAP2C so as to repress GPX1 transcription, thereafter inhibiting GPXA expression. In the end, rescue experiments proved the whole regulation mechanism of miR-29b/29c-3p in T-ALL. Overall, the miR-29b/29c-3p -TFAP2C-GPX1 axis helped us to have a better understanding of T-ALL pathogenesis.","['Zhuang, Mengli', 'Chaolumen, Qiqige', 'Li, Linlin', 'Chen, Baiyu', 'Su, Qin', 'Yang, Yinan', 'Zhang, Xiaomeng']","['Zhuang M', 'Chaolumen Q', 'Li L', 'Chen B', 'Su Q', 'Yang Y', 'Zhang X']","['Department of Pediatrics, The Affiliated Hospital of Inner Mongolia Medical University, NO.1 Gangdao Street, Huimin District, Hohhot, 010050, Inner Mongolia, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, The Affiliated Hospital of Inner Mongolia Medical University, NO.1 Gangdao Street, Huimin District, Hohhot, 010050, Inner Mongolia, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, The Affiliated Hospital of Inner Mongolia Medical University, NO.1 Gangdao Street, Huimin District, Hohhot, 010050, Inner Mongolia, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, The Affiliated Hospital of Inner Mongolia Medical University, NO.1 Gangdao Street, Huimin District, Hohhot, 010050, Inner Mongolia, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, The Affiliated Hospital of Inner Mongolia Medical University, NO.1 Gangdao Street, Huimin District, Hohhot, 010050, Inner Mongolia, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, The Affiliated Hospital of Inner Mongolia Medical University, NO.1 Gangdao Street, Huimin District, Hohhot, 010050, Inner Mongolia, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, The Affiliated Hospital of Inner Mongolia Medical University, NO.1 Gangdao Street, Huimin District, Hohhot, 010050, Inner Mongolia, China.

Ultrastructurally, these pseudothrombi are unique for having a crystalline substructure. We describe a case of an adult patient with monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (MBL) and acute renal failure whose kidney biopsy revealed a rare diagnosis of CAN. CASE PRESENTATION: A 63-year old male presented with a 2-month history of edema, arthralgia and malaise. He had acute kidney injury with hematoproteinuria on urine analysis. Serum and urine protein electrophoresis were both negative. A renal biopsy however revealed features of CAN. Organomegaly, bone pain and lymphadenopathy were absent. A repeat serum electrophoresis was positive for IgA kappa and a free light chain assay showed elevated free kappa light chains. Flow cytometry done subsequently revealed a diagnosis of MBL, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) type. CONCLUSION: CAN in association with MBL/CLL has not been previously described in literature, and our case highlights yet another instance of monoclonal gammopathy of renal significance (MGRS) where a small B-cell clone resulted in extensive renal pathology without systemic manifestations.","['Gupta, Rajib K', 'Arend, Lois J', 'Bk, Anupama', 'Narsipur, Sriram', 'Bhargava, Ramya']","['Gupta RK', 'Arend LJ', 'Bk A', 'Narsipur S', 'Bhargava R']","['Department of Pathology, SUNY Upstate Medical University, 750 E Adams Street, Syracuse, NY, 13210, USA. rajibgupta2011@gmail.com.', 'Department of Pathology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, SUNY Upstate Medical University, Syracuse, NY, USA.', 'Department of Medicine and Nephrology, SUNY Upstate Medical University, Syracuse, NY, USA.', 'Department of Nephrology, SUNY Upstate Medical University, Syracuse, NY, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20200518,England,BMC Nephrol,BMC nephrology,100967793,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Light Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains)']",IM,"['Acute Kidney Injury/blood/*diagnosis/etiology/pathology', '*B-Lymphocytes', '*Crystallization', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Light Chains/*blood', 'Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains/*blood', 'Kidney/*pathology', 'Kidney Diseases/blood/diagnosis/etiology/pathology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell', 'Lymphocytosis/blood/complications/*diagnosis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Paraproteinemias/blood/complications/*diagnosis']",PMC7236346,['NOTNLM'],"['*Crystalglobulin-associated nephropathy', '*Monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis', '*Monoclonal gammopathy of renal significance']",2020/05/20 06:00,2021/09/10 06:00,['2020/05/20 06:00'],"['2020/01/01 00:00 [received]', '2020/04/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/05/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/10 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12882-020-01818-5 [doi]', '10.1186/s12882-020-01818-5 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Nephrol. 2020 May 18;21(1):184. doi: 10.1186/s12882-020-01818-5.,['ORCID: 0000-0003-2499-9528'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite various efforts in detection and treatment, many patients with AML die of this cancer. That is why it is important to develop novel therapeutic options, employing strategic target genes involved in apoptosis and tumor progression. METHODS: The aim of the study was to evaluate PARP1, PARP2, PARP3, and TRPM2 gene expression at mRNA level using qPCR method in the cells of hematopoietic system of the bone marrow in patients with acute myeloid leukemia, bone marrow collected from healthy patients, peripheral blood of healthy individuals, and hematopoietic stem cells from the peripheral blood after mobilization. RESULTS: The results found that the bone marrow cells of the patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) show overexpression of PARP1 and PARP2 genes and decreased TRPM2 gene expression. In the hematopoietic stem cells derived from the normal marrow and peripheral blood after mobilization, the opposite situation was observed, i.e. TRPM2 gene showed increased expression while PARP1 and PARP2 gene expression was reduced. We observed positive correlations between PARP1, PARP2, PARP3, and TRPM2 genes expression in the group of mature mononuclear cells derived from the peripheral blood and in the group of bone marrow-derived cells. In AML cells significant correlations were not observed between the expression of the examined genes. In addition, we observed that the reduced expression of TRPM2 and overexpression of PARP1 are associated with a shorter overall survival of patients, indicating the prognostic significance of these genes expression in AML. CONCLUSIONS: Our research suggests that in physiological conditions in the cells of the hematopoietic system there is mutual positive regulation of PARP1, PARP2, PARP3, and TRPM2 genes expression. PARP1, PARP2, and TRPM2 genes at mRNA level deregulate in acute myeloid leukemia cells.","['Gil-Kulik, Paulina', 'Dudzinska, Ewa', 'Radzikowska-Buchner, Elzbieta', 'Wawer, Joanna', 'Jojczuk, Mariusz', 'Nogalski, Adam', 'Wawer, Genowefa Anna', 'Feldo, Marcin', 'Kocki, Wojciech', 'Cioch, Maria', 'Bogucka-Kocka, Anna', 'Rahnama, Mansur', 'Kocki, Janusz']","['Gil-Kulik P', 'Dudzinska E', 'Radzikowska-Buchner E', 'Wawer J', 'Jojczuk M', 'Nogalski A', 'Wawer GA', 'Feldo M', 'Kocki W', 'Cioch M', 'Bogucka-Kocka A', 'Rahnama M', 'Kocki J']","['Department of Clinical Genetics, Medical University of Lublin, 11 Radziwillowska Str, 20-080, Lublin, Poland. pgil.poczt@vp.pl.', 'Department of Public Health, Faculty of Health Sciences, Medical University of Lublin, 1 Chodzki Str, 20-093, Lublin, Poland.', ""Department of Plastic Surgery, Saint Elizabeth's Hospital, 1 Goszczynskiego Str, 02-616, Warsaw, Poland."", 'Department of Clinical Genetics, Medical University of Lublin, 11 Radziwillowska Str, 20-080, Lublin, Poland.', 'Chair and Department of Trauma Surgery and Emergency Medicine, Medical University of Lublin, 16 Staszica Str, 20-081, Lublin, Poland.', 'Chair and Department of Trauma Surgery and Emergency Medicine, Medical University of Lublin, 16 Staszica Str, 20-081, Lublin, Poland.', 'Department of Foreign Languages Medical University of Lublin, 4 Jaczewskiego Str, 20-090, Lublin, Poland.', 'Chair and Department of Vascular Surgery and Angiology, Medical University of Lublin, 11 Staszica Str, 20-081, Lublin, Poland.', 'Department of Architecture and Urban Planning, University of Technology, 40 Nadbystrzycka Str, 20-618, Lublin, Poland.', 'Chair and Department of Hematooncology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Medical University of Lublin, 11 Staszica Str, 20-081, Lublin, Poland.', 'Chair and Department of Biology and Genetics, Medical University of Lublin, 4a Chodzki Str, 20-093, Lublin, Poland.', 'Chair and Department of Dental Surgery Medical University of Lublin, 7 Karmelicka Str, 20-081, Lublin, Poland.', 'Department of Clinical Genetics, Medical University of Lublin, 11 Radziwillowska Str, 20-080, Lublin, Poland.']",['eng'],['STRATEGMED3/303570/7/NCBR/2017/Narodowe Centrum Badan i Rozwoju'],['Journal Article'],20200518,England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (TRPM Cation Channels)', '0 (TRPM2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (PARP1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (PARP2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (PARP3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly (ADP-Ribose) Polymerase-1)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Poly (ADP-Ribose) Polymerase-1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Prognosis', 'TRPM Cation Channels/genetics/*metabolism', 'Young Adult']",PMC7236215,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'Hematopoietic stem cells', 'PARP1', 'PARP2', 'PARP3', 'TRPM2 gene expression']",2020/05/20 06:00,2021/01/13 06:00,['2020/05/20 06:00'],"['2019/12/10 00:00 [received]', '2020/04/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/05/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/13 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12885-020-06903-4 [doi]', '10.1186/s12885-020-06903-4 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2020 May 18;20(1):435. doi: 10.1186/s12885-020-06903-4.,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3119-981X'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of an adolescent girl, recently diagnosed with ALL, who presented with pain in abdomen and breathing difficulty following chemotherapy with L-asparaginase. On subsequent evaluation, she was found to have high anion gap metabolic acidosis, hyperglycemia and ketonuria. Ultrasonogram showed bulky pancreas. DKA was managed with fluid correction and insulin infusion. Pancreatitis was managed conservatively. She recovered completely with resolution of symptoms and without any major adverse events despite having such severe complications. CONCLUSION: We conclude that the combination of DKA and pancreatitis is a rare occurrence with significant morbidity and mortality. We recommend a close monitoring of blood glucose levels for hyperglycemia as well as a high index of clinical suspicion for pancreatitis in patients with ALL receiving L-asparaginase.","['Jameel, Patel Zeeshan', 'Lohiya, Sham', 'Dongre, Amol', 'Damke, Sachin', 'Lakhkar, Bhavana B']","['Jameel PZ', 'Lohiya S', 'Dongre A', 'Damke S', 'Lakhkar BB']","['Department of Paediatrics, Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College, Sawangi Meghe, Wardha, India. zeeshan1311@gmail.com.', 'Department of Paediatrics, Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College, Sawangi Meghe, Wardha, India.', 'Department of Oncology, Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College, Sawangi Meghe, Wardha, India.', 'Department of Paediatrics, Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College, Sawangi Meghe, Wardha, India.', 'Department of Paediatrics, Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College, Sawangi Meghe, Wardha, India.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20200518,England,BMC Pediatr,BMC pediatrics,100967804,['EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Asparaginase/*adverse effects', 'Child', '*Diabetic Ketoacidosis/chemically induced/diagnosis', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Pancreatitis/chemically induced/diagnosis', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/drug therapy']",PMC7236281,['NOTNLM'],"['*Diabetic ketoacidosis', '*L-asparaginase', '*Pancreatitis']",2020/05/20 06:00,2021/05/08 06:00,['2020/05/20 06:00'],"['2020/01/23 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/05/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/08 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12887-020-02136-3 [doi]', '10.1186/s12887-020-02136-3 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Pediatr. 2020 May 18;20(1):228. doi: 10.1186/s12887-020-02136-3.,['ORCID: 0000-0002-8040-4835'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The understanding of how human bone marrow is affected on a transcriptional level leading to the development of myelosuppression is required for the implementation of personalized treatments in the future. In this study, we treated human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) harvested from a patient with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) with gemcitabine/carboplatin. Thereafter, scRNA-seq was performed to distinguish transcriptional effects induced by gemcitabine/carboplatin. Gene expression was calculated and evaluated among cells within and between samples compared to untreated cells. Cell cycle analysis showed that the treatments effectively decrease cell proliferation, indicated by the proportion of cells in the G2M-phase dropping from 35% in untreated cells to 14.3% in treated cells. Clustering and t-SNE showed that cells within samples and between treated and untreated samples were affected differently. Enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes showed that the treatments influence KEGG pathways and Gene Ontologies related to myeloid cell proliferation/differentiation, immune response, cancer, and the cell cycle. The present study shows the feasibility of using scRNA-seq and chemotherapy-treated HSPCs to find genes, pathways, and biological processes affected among and between treated and untreated cells. This indicates the possible gains of using single-cell toxicity studies for personalized medicine.","['Bjorn, Niclas', 'Jakobsen, Ingrid', 'Lotfi, Kourosh', 'Green, Henrik']","['Bjorn N', 'Jakobsen I', 'Lotfi K', 'Green H']","['Clinical Pharmacology, Division of Drug Research, Department of Biomedical and Clinical Sciences, Linkoping University, 581 85 Linkoping, Sweden.', 'Clinical Pharmacology, Division of Drug Research, Department of Biomedical and Clinical Sciences, Linkoping University, 581 85 Linkoping, Sweden.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Orebro University Hospital, 701 85 Orebro, Sweden.', 'Clinical Pharmacology, Division of Drug Research, Department of Biomedical and Clinical Sciences, Linkoping University, 581 85 Linkoping, Sweden.', 'Department of Hematology, Linkoping University Hospital, 581 85 Linkoping, Sweden.', 'Clinical Pharmacology, Division of Drug Research, Department of Biomedical and Clinical Sciences, Linkoping University, 581 85 Linkoping, Sweden.', 'Department of Forensic Genetics and Forensic Toxicology, National Board of Forensic Medicine, 587 58 Linkoping, Sweden.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200514,Switzerland,Genes (Basel),Genes,101551097,"['0W860991D6 (Deoxycytidine)', 'B76N6SBZ8R (gemcitabine)', 'BG3F62OND5 (Carboplatin)']",IM,"['Carboplatin/*pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Deoxycytidine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Ontology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*chemistry/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/pathology', 'RNA-Seq', 'Sequence Alignment', '*Single-Cell Analysis']",PMC7288450,['NOTNLM'],"['*adverse drug reactions', '*carboplatin', '*gemcitabine', '*hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells', '*myelosuppression', '*single-cell RNA sequencing', '*toxicity']",2020/05/20 06:00,2021/03/25 06:00,['2020/05/20 06:00'],"['2020/04/29 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/11 00:00 [revised]', '2020/05/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/05/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/25 06:00 [medline]']","['genes11050549 [pii]', '10.3390/genes11050549 [doi]']",epublish,Genes (Basel). 2020 May 14;11(5). pii: genes11050549. doi: 10.3390/genes11050549.,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-6806-4527', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4450-0333', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5797-7232', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8015-5728']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Under pathological conditions, the role of actomyosin contractility in malignant phenotypes of various solid tumors has been extensively discussed, but the pathophysiological relevance in hematopoietic malignancies has yet to be elucidated. In this study, we found enhanced actomyosin contractility in diverse acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines represented by highly expressed non-muscle myosin heavy chain A (NMIIA) and increased phosphorylation of the myosin regulatory light chain. Genetic and pharmacological inhibition of actomyosin contractility induced multivalent malignancy- suppressive effects in AML cells. In this context, perturbed actomyosin contractility enhances AML cell apoptosis through cytokinesis failure and aryl hydrocarbon receptor activation. Moreover, leukemic oncogenes were downregulated by the YAP/TAZ-mediated mechanotransduction pathway. Our results provide a theoretical background for targeting actomyosin contractility to suppress the malignancy of AML cells.","['Chang, Fengjiao', 'Kong, So Jung', 'Wang, Lele', 'Choi, Beom K', 'Lee, Hyewon', 'Kim, Chan', 'Kim, Jin Man', 'Park, Kyungpyo']","['Chang F', 'Kong SJ', 'Wang L', 'Choi BK', 'Lee H', 'Kim C', 'Kim JM', 'Park K']","['Department of Physiology, School of Dentistry, Seoul National University and Dental Research Institute, Seoul 110-749, Korea.', 'Medical Oncology, CHA Bundang Medical Center, CHA University, Seongnam 13488, Korea.', 'Laboratory of Translational Immuno-Oncology, Seongnam 13488, Korea.', 'Department of Physiology, School of Dentistry, Seoul National University and Dental Research Institute, Seoul 110-749, Korea.', 'Biomedicine Production Branch, National Cancer Center, Goyang 10408, Korea.', 'Hematologic Oncology Clinic, Center for Specific Organs Cancer Research Institute & Hospital, National Cancer Center, Goyang 10408, Korea.', 'Medical Oncology, CHA Bundang Medical Center, CHA University, Seongnam 13488, Korea.', 'Laboratory of Translational Immuno-Oncology, Seongnam 13488, Korea.', 'Department of Dentistry, School of Medicine, CHA University, CHA Bundang Medical Center, Seongnam 13488, Korea.', 'Department of Physiology, School of Dentistry, Seoul National University and Dental Research Institute, Seoul 110-749, Korea.']",['eng'],"['NRF-2018R1A5A2024418 and NRF-2018R1A2B3005113/National Research Foundation of', 'Korea']",['Journal Article'],20200514,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Contractile Proteins)', '0 (MYH9 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (YAP-Signaling Proteins)', '0 (YAP1 protein, human)', '9013-26-7 (Actomyosin)', 'EC 3.6.4.1 (Myosin Heavy Chains)']",IM,"['Actin Cytoskeleton/genetics', 'Actomyosin/*genetics', 'Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/genetics', 'Cell Adhesion/genetics', 'Cell Division/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement/genetics', 'Contractile Proteins/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Mechanotransduction, Cellular/genetics', 'Myosin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'Phosphorylation', 'Transcription Factors/genetics', 'YAP-Signaling Proteins']",PMC7279019,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'contractility', 'malignant phenotypes', 'non-muscle myosin II']",2020/05/20 06:00,2021/02/12 06:00,['2020/05/20 06:00'],"['2020/04/28 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/10 00:00 [revised]', '2020/05/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/05/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/12 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms21103460 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms21103460 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2020 May 14;21(10). pii: ijms21103460. doi: 10.3390/ijms21103460.,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-9780-6155', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4751-7125', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4908-1270']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Childhood cancer survivors are at elevated risk for developing cholelithiasis. However, their incidence of and risk factors for late (>5 years from diagnosis) cholecystectomy have not been studied. METHODS: A total of 25,549 survivors (median age at diagnosis 6.9 years, range 0-21.0; current age 30.7 years, range 5.6-65.9) diagnosed between 1970 and 1999 and 5037 siblings were queried for self-reported cholecystectomy occurring five or more years from primary cancer diagnosis. Piecewise exponential models evaluated associations between cancer treatment exposures and late cholecystectomy. RESULTS: Over a median follow-up period of 21.9 and 26.0 years, respectively, 789 survivors and 168 siblings underwent late cholecystectomy (cumulative incidence 7.2%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 6.5-7.8% and 6.6%, 95% CI = 5.4-7.6%, respectively; rate ratio [RR] = 1.3, 95% CI = 1.1-1.5). Compared with siblings, survivors of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (RR = 1.4, 95% CI = 1.2-1.8), soft tissue sarcoma (RR = 1.4, 95% CI = 1.0-1.8) and bone cancer (RR = 1.3, 95% CI = 1.0-1.8) were at the greatest risk. In addition to attained age, female sex and increasing body mass index, exposure to high-dose (>/=750 mg/m(2)) platinum chemotherapy (RR = 2.6, 95% CI = 1.5-4.5), vinca alkaloid chemotherapy (RR = 1.4, 95% CI = 1.1-1.8) or total body irradiation (TBI; RR = 2.2, 95% CI = 1.2-4.2) were each associated with late cholecystectomy. CONCLUSIONS: Independent of traditional risk factors for gallbladder disease, exposure to high-dose platinum chemotherapy, vinca alkaloid chemotherapy or TBI increased risk for late cholecystectomy.

In case-control studies on brain and head tumours during 1997-2003 and 2007-2009 we assessed life-time occupations in addition to exposure to different agents. The INTEROCC ELF-EMF Job-Exposure Matrix was used for associating occupations with ELF-EMF exposure (muT) with acoustic neuroma. Cumulative exposure (muT-years), average exposure (muT) and maximum exposed job (muT) were calculated. No increased risk for acoustic neuroma was found in any category. For cumulative exposure in the highest exposure category 8.52+ muT years odds ratio (OR) = 1.2, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.8-2.0, p linear trend = 0.37 was calculated. No statistically significant risks were found in the time windows 1-14 years, and 15+ years, respectively.

In a single-center retrospective analysis, course and outcome of all allografted patients treated with CD19 CAR constructs for B cell lymphoma between October 2018 and November 2019 were studied. CAR therapy consisted either of a third-generation CAR (HD-CAR-1) or of commercially manufactured axicabtagene ciloleucel (axi-cel; Gilead, Santa Monica, U.S.). Altogether, 10 CAR T cell dosings using recipient leukapheresis products were performed in 8 patients: 4 patients (2 mantle cell lymphoma, 2 chronic lymphocytic leukemia) received 6 dosings with HD-CAR-1 and 4 patients (all with diffuse large B cell lymphoma) received 4 dosings with axi-cel. Overall, 6 of 8 patients (75%) responded. CAR treatment was well tolerated with grade >/= 3 cytokine release syndrome and neurotoxicity each being observed after 1 of 10 dosings. A single patient had moderate chronic graft-versus-host disease. Of note, 3 of 4 patients who received axi-cel had ongoing grade >/= 3 cytopenia 3 months postdosing, whereas prolonged cytopenia was not observed in 9 alloHCT-naive patients who received axi-cel during the same time period. In conclusion, CAR T cell treatment from recipient-derived leukapheresis products after a prior alloHCT appears to be feasible, effective, and safe in patients with B cell lymphoma. Protracted cytopenia after axi-cel treatment is a matter of concern and requires further exploration.","['Schubert, Maria-Luisa', 'Dietrich, Sascha', 'Stilgenbauer, Stephan', 'Schmitt, Anita', 'Pavel, Petra', 'Kunz, Alexander', 'Bondong, Andrea', 'Wegner, Mandy', 'Stadtherr, Peter', 'Jung, Susanne', 'Ho, Anthony D', 'Muller-Tidow, Carsten', 'Schmitt, Michael', 'Dreger, Peter']","['Schubert ML', 'Dietrich S', 'Stilgenbauer S', 'Schmitt A', 'Pavel P', 'Kunz A', 'Bondong A', 'Wegner M', 'Stadtherr P', 'Jung S', 'Ho AD', 'Muller-Tidow C', 'Schmitt M', 'Dreger P']","['Department of Internal Medicine V, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.

In addition, we explored the efficacy of dual T cell depletion using anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) and post-transplantation cyclophosphamide (PTCy) for the prevention of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in patients undergoing RIC allo-HCT. Our study cohort comprised 356 adults with AML in complete remission who underwent allo-HCT between 2013 and 2018. One hundred eleven patients (31.2%) received a MAC regimen, and 245 (68.8%) received an RIC regimen. One hundred seventy-one of the patients who received an RIC regimen (68.4%) received ATG, PTCy, and cyclosporine (ATG-PTCY-CsA) for GVHD prophylaxis in accordance with our institutional protocol. Data were collected retrospectively and updated in July 2019. With a median follow-up of 14.5 months (range, 0 to 76 months), 161 patients (45.2%) died, and 66 (18.5%) relapsed. Two-year overall survival (OS), relapse-free survival (RFS), and GVHD-free/RFS (GRFS) were 55%, 52.6%, and 35%, respectively. The intensity of the conditioning regimen, with or without ATG-PTCY-CsA, did not have a significant impact on OS and RFS. However, RIC in combination with ATG-PTCY-CsA was associated with a significantly lower cumulative incidence of acute GVHD and chronic GVHD. The use of RIC with ATG-PTCy-CsA was a significant predictor for higher GRFS secondary to the reduction of clinically relevant GVHD (P= .0001). In patients with AML, RIC allografts and dual T cell modulation with ATG and PTCy led to superior GRFS. The use of this GVHD prophylaxis strategy, along with mitigation of conditioning toxicity using RIC, may result in better long-term quality of life for allo-HCT recipients.","['Salas, Maria Queralt', 'Chen, Shiyi', 'Lam, Wilson', 'Pasic, Ivan', 'Gerbitz, Armin', 'Michelis, Fotios V', 'Kim, Dennis Dong Hwan', 'Al-Shaibani, Zeyad', 'Lipton, Jeffrey Howard', 'Mattsson, Jonas', 'Kumar, Rajat', 'Viswabandya, Auro', 'Law, Arjun Datt']","['Salas MQ', 'Chen S', 'Lam W', 'Pasic I', 'Gerbitz A', 'Michelis FV', 'Kim DDH', 'Al-Shaibani Z', 'Lipton JH', 'Mattsson J', 'Kumar R', 'Viswabandya A', 'Law AD']","[""Hans Messner Allogeneic Blood and Marrow Transplantation Program, Division of Medical Oncology and Hematology, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada;

While initial studies of LSD1 inhibitors suggested these compounds may be used to induce differentiation of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), the mechanisms underlying this effect and dose-limiting toxicities are not well understood. Here, we used precision nuclear run-on sequencing (PRO-seq) and ChIP-seq in AML cell lines to probe for the earliest regulatory events associated with INCB059872 treatment. The changes in nascent transcription could be traced back to a loss of CoREST activity and activation of GFI1-regulated genes. INCB059872 is in phase I clinical trials, and we evaluated a pre-treatment bone marrow sample of a patient who showed a clinical response to INCB059872 while being treated with azacitidine. We used single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) to show that INCB059872 caused a shift in gene expression that was again associated with GFI1/GFI1B regulation. Finally, we treated mice with INCB059872 and performed scRNA-seq of lineage-negative bone marrow cells, which showed that INCB059872 triggered accumulation of megakaryocyte early progenitor cells with gene expression hallmarks of stem cells. Accumulation of these stem/progenitor cells may contribute to the thrombocytopenia observed in patients treated with LSD1 inhibitors.","['Johnston, Gretchen', 'Ramsey, Haley E', 'Liu, Qi', 'Wang, Jing', 'Stengel, Kristy R', 'Sampathi, Shilpa', 'Acharya, Pankaj', 'Arrate, Maria', 'Stubbs, Matthew C', 'Burn, Timothy', 'Savona, Michael R', 'Hiebert, Scott W']","['Johnston G', 'Ramsey HE', 'Liu Q', 'Wang J', 'Stengel KR', 'Sampathi S', 'Acharya P', 'Arrate M', 'Stubbs MC', 'Burn T', 'Savona MR', 'Hiebert SW']","['Department of Biochemistry, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN 37232, USA.', 'Department of Medicine and Program in Cancer Biology, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN 37203, USA.', 'Department of Biostatistics, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN 37203, USA; Center for Quantitative Sciences, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN 37232, USA.', 'Department of Biostatistics, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN 37203, USA; Center for Quantitative Sciences, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN 37232, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN 37232, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN 37232, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN 37232, USA.', 'Department of Medicine and Program in Cancer Biology, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN 37203, USA.', 'Incyte Corporation, Wilmington, DE 19803, USA.', 'Incyte Corporation, Wilmington, DE 19803, USA.', 'Department of Medicine and Program in Cancer Biology, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN 37203, USA; Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN 37027, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN 37232, USA; Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN 37027, USA.

This study aimed to determine the efficacy of statins on rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and clarify how statins affect its pathogenesis. Fluvastatin (500 mug/kg/day) or vehicle was given per os to env-pX rats, which carry the human T-cell leukemia virus type I env-pX gene and spontaneously develop destructive arthritis mimicking RA, for 30 days. Blood sampling and ultrasonography (US) of the ankle joints were conducted on days 0, 10, 20, and 30. On day 30, all rats were euthanized, and the ankle joints were subjected to histological analysis. To clarify how fluvastatin affects the pathogenesis of RA, comprehensive serum exosomal microRNA (miRNA) analysis was performed. Gene expression in the primary culture of synovial fibroblasts derived from arthritic rat and human and non-arthritic rat periarticular tissues was determined quantitatively by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). As a result, the development of arthritis in env-pX rats was significantly suppressed by fluvastatin, which was evident from the viewpoints of serology, US imaging, and histology. Comprehensive serum exosomal miRNA analysis suggested that the expression of Rho GTPase-activating protein 12 (Arhgap12) was decreased in arthritic env-pX rats but increased with the administration of fluvastatin. Corresponding results were obtained by quantitative RT- PCR using primary culture of synovial fibroblasts. The collective findings suggest that fluvastatin prevents the development of arthritis in env-pX rats via the up-regulation of ARHGAP12. This study suggests that ARHGAP12 can be a possible therapeutic target of RA.","['Tanimura, Shun', 'Nishida, Mutsumi', 'Horie, Tatsunori', 'Kamishima, Tamotsu', 'Matsumoto, Hitomi', 'Morimura, Yutaka', 'Nishibata, Yuka', 'Masuda, Sakiko', 'Nakazawa, Daigo', 'Tomaru, Utano', 'Atsumi, Tatsuya', 'Ishizu, Akihiro']","['Tanimura S', 'Nishida M', 'Horie T', 'Kamishima T', 'Matsumoto H', 'Morimura Y', 'Nishibata Y', 'Masuda S', 'Nakazawa D', 'Tomaru U', 'Atsumi T', 'Ishizu A']","['Department of Rheumatology, Endocrinology and Nephrology, Faculty of Medicine and Graduate School of Medicine, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan.', 'Division of Laboratory and Transfusion Medicine, Hokkaido University Hospital, Sapporo, Japan.', 'Department of Radiological Technology, Hokkaido University Hospital, Sapporo, Japan.', 'Department of Biomedical Science and Engineering, Faculty of Health Sciences, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan.', 'Department of Medical Laboratory Science, Faculty of Health Sciences, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan.', 'Department of Medical Laboratory Science, Faculty of Health Sciences, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan.', 'Department of Medical Laboratory Science, Faculty of Health Sciences, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan.', 'Department of Medical Laboratory Science, Faculty of Health Sciences, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan.', 'Department of Rheumatology, Endocrinology and Nephrology, Faculty of Medicine and Graduate School of Medicine, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine and Graduate School of Medicine, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan.', 'Department of Rheumatology, Endocrinology and Nephrology, Faculty of Medicine and Graduate School of Medicine, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan.', 'Department of Medical Laboratory Science, Faculty of Health Sciences, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan.

Even though incorporation of the retrovirus close to the oncogene for T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), LIM-only protein 2 (LMO2) is observed frequently, but it is not clear why LMO2 expression is affected. It was demonstrated that in all the typical T-ALL oncogenes, there is mainly transcription of LMO2 in CD34+ progenitor cells. LYL1, TAN1, and TAL1 are very important intensification factors that are classically used in the gene therapy for copying LMO2 when they are stimulated. For this reason, oncogenes are susceptible to amalgamation with viruses. The IL-2R-gamma (IL-2 receptor gamma chain) was found to be a supporting oncogene to LMO2. Nevertheless it was illustrated that excessive expression of IL-2R-gamma did not affect T-cell growth. In comparison to it, the excessive expression of LMO2 in CD34+ cells can cause ongoing increases in the development of T cells. Conversely, there is no effect on the development of B cells and myeloid cells. This information helps explain why LMO2 is mostly affected by various identified T-ALL oncogenes. In addition, throughout the process of T-cell development, expression of IL2R-gamma mediated by retrovirus may not always be oncogenic. As an alternative, replacement of signals of common IL-7 receptors may increase development of T cells wherever LMO2 was expressed and caused abnormal thymocyte development.","['Ahmed, Bilal', 'Zafar, Maria', 'Qadir, Muhammad Imran']","['Ahmed B', 'Zafar M', 'Qadir MI']","['Department of Clinical Pharmacology, School of Pharmacy, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Quaid-i-Azam University, Islamabad, Pakistan.', 'Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology, Bahauddin Zakariya University, Bosan Road, Multan, Pakistan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Crit Rev Eukaryot Gene Expr,Critical reviews in eukaryotic gene expression,9007261,['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Carcinogenesis/*genetics', 'Genetic Therapy/methods', 'Humans', 'Mutagenesis, Insertional/methods', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', 'X-Linked Combined Immunodeficiency Diseases/*genetics']",,,,2019/01/01 00:00,2020/09/18 06:00,['2020/05/19 06:00'],"['2020/05/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/18 06:00 [medline]']","['08ce6e017cfee356,6a8c48b20f50735b [pii]', '10.1615/CritRevEukaryotGeneExpr.2019026820 [doi]']",ppublish,Crit Rev Eukaryot Gene Expr. 2019;29(6):511-520. doi: 10.1615/CritRevEukaryotGeneExpr.2019026820.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although CD4+FoxP3+ Treg cells are well studied, our current knowledge of the biology of CD8+ Treg cells has several critical gaps. A major limitation was our inability to distinguish them from conventional CD8+ T cells. In this regard, we have recently discovered an innate-like PLZF+CD8alphaalpha+TCRalphabeta+ Treg population (CD8alphaalpha Treg cells) that is enriched in the liver in naive mice and present in healthy humans. We have demonstrated that these CD8alphaalpha Treg cells serve as a feedback regulatory mechanism and target only activated effector T cells. Such feedback regulation allows the progression of an immune defense response yet prevents excessive tissue damage. It is likely that the PLZF transcription program endows the CD8alphaalpha Treg cells with the innate features that are important for them to effectively control autoimmune responses by targeting activated T cells in both mice and humans. Additional features of the CD8alphaalpha Treg cells include their dependence on IL-15/IL-2Rbeta signaling, the expression of NK-inhibitory receptors, and the memory phenotype. Importantly, these cells are expanded following an ongoing immune response and serve as a feedback regulatory mechanism to control activated effector T cells, and hence prevent an excessive immune stimulation. In this review, we will briefly summarize recent important findings related to CD8+ Treg cells.","['Tang, Xiaolei', 'Kumar, Vipin']","['Tang X', 'Kumar V']","['Department of Veterinary Biomedical Sciences, College of Veterinary Medicine, Long Island University, Brookville, New York, USA; Division of Regenerative Medicine, Department of Medicine, Department of Basic Sciences, Loma Linda University, Loma Linda, California, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, University of California at San Diego, La Jolla, California, USA.']",['eng'],['P30 DK120515/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Crit Rev Immunol,Critical reviews in immunology,8914819,"['0 (FOXP3 protein, human)', '0 (Forkhead Transcription Factors)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Autoimmune Diseases/*immunology', 'Autoimmunity', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Feedback, Physiological', 'Forkhead Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Immune Tolerance', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein/*metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/*immunology']",,,,2019/01/01 00:00,2020/09/05 06:00,['2020/05/19 06:00'],"['2020/05/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/05 06:00 [medline]']","['4374649919dca123,0b8265f976d0495e [pii]', '10.1615/CritRevImmunol.2020033260 [doi]']",ppublish,Crit Rev Immunol. 2019;39(6):409-421. doi: 10.1615/CritRevImmunol.2020033260.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In these patients, it has been recently shown that a subset of B cells possesses regulatory functions and secretes high levels of interleukin 10 (IL-10). Our investigation identified that CLL cells with a CD19+CD24+CD38hi immunophenotype (B regulatory cell [Breg]-like CLL cells) produce high amounts of IL-10 and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) and are capable of transforming naive T helper cells into CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ T regulatory cells (Tregs) in an IL-10/TGF-beta-dependent manner. A strong correlation between the percentage of CD38+ CLL cells and Tregs was observed. CD38hi Tregs comprised more than 50% of Tregs in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in patients with CLL. Anti-CD38 targeting agents resulted in lethality of both Breg-like CLL and Treg cells via apoptosis. Ex vivo, use of anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapy was associated with a reduction in IL-10 and CLL patient-derived Tregs, but an increase in interferon-gamma and proliferation of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells with an activated phenotype, which showed an improved ability to lyse patient-autologous CLL cells. Finally, effects of anti-CD38 mAb therapy were validated in a CLL-patient-derived xenograft model in vivo, which showed decreased percentage of Bregs, Tregs, and PD1+CD38hiCD8+ T cells, but increased Th17 and CD8+ T cells (vs vehicle). Altogether, our results demonstrate that targeting CD38 in CLL can modulate the tumor microenvironment; skewing T-cell populations from an immunosuppressive to immune-reactive milieu, thus promoting immune reconstitution for enhanced anti-CLL response.","['Manna, Alak', 'Kellett, Timothy', 'Aulakh, Sonikpreet', 'Lewis-Tuffin, Laura J', 'Dutta, Navnita', 'Knutson, Keith', 'Chini, Eduardo', 'Pinilla-Ibarz, Javier', 'Lamanna, Nicole', 'Manochakian, Rami', 'Malavasi, Fabio', 'Sher, Taimur', 'Chanan-Khan, Asher A', 'Ailawadhi, Sikander', 'Paulus, Aneel']","['Manna A', 'Kellett T', 'Aulakh S', 'Lewis-Tuffin LJ', 'Dutta N', 'Knutson K', 'Chini E', 'Pinilla-Ibarz J', 'Lamanna N', 'Manochakian R', 'Malavasi F', 'Sher T', 'Chanan-Khan AA', 'Ailawadhi S', 'Paulus A']","['Department of Cancer Biology, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, FL.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, FL.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, FL.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, FL.', 'Department of Immunology, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, FL.', 'Department of Immunology, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, FL.', 'Signal Transduction Laboratory, Kogod Aging Center, Department of Anesthesiology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.', 'Department of Malignant Hematology, Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, FL.', 'Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, FL.', 'Laboratory of Immunogenetics, Department of Medical Science, University of Turin, Turin, Italy; and.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, FL.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, FL.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, FL.', ""Mayo Clinic Cancer Center at St. Vincent's Medical Center Riverside, Jacksonville, FL."", 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, FL.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, FL.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, FL.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA233790/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U54 GM104942/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA015083/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AG058812/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'N01 CA015083/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)'],IM,"['*B-Lymphocytes, Regulatory', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents', '*Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory', 'Tumor Microenvironment']",PMC7252547,,,2020/05/19 06:00,2021/05/15 06:00,['2020/05/19 06:00'],"['2019/10/15 00:00 [received]', '2020/04/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/05/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/15 06:00 [medline]']","['S2473-9529(20)31290-8 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2019001091 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Adv. 2020 May 26;4(10):2143-2157. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2019001091.,,,['(c) 2020 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These three-dimensional structures can be maintained in culture long-term, do not require immortalization, and recapitulate the multilayered composition of the epithelial lining of the oral mucosa. Here, we validate the use of this model to study the effect of Leucovorin (LV) on Methotrexate (MTX)-induced toxicity. MTX is a chemotherapeutic agent used in the treatment of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Although effective, the use of MTX often results in severe side-effects, including oral mucositis, which is characterized by epithelial cell death. Here, we show that organoids are sensitive to MTX, and that the addition of LV reduces MTX toxicity, in both a concentration- and timing-dependent manner. Additionally, we show that a 24 hour 'pretreatment' with LV reduces MTX-induced cell death, suggesting that such a pretreatment could decrease mucositis in patients. Taken together, we provide the first in vitro model to study the effect of MTX on wildtype oral mucosa cells. Our findings underscore the relevance of the clinically applied LV regimen and highlight the potential of this model to further optimize modifications in dosing and timing of Leucovorin on oral mucosa cells.","['Driehuis, E', 'Oosterom, N', 'Heil, S G', 'Muller, I B', 'Lin, M', 'Kolders, S', 'Jansen, G', 'de Jonge, R', 'Pieters, R', 'Clevers, H', 'van den Heuvel-Eibrink, M M']","['Driehuis E', 'Oosterom N', 'Heil SG', 'Muller IB', 'Lin M', 'Kolders S', 'Jansen G', 'de Jonge R', 'Pieters R', 'Clevers H', 'van den Heuvel-Eibrink MM']","['Oncode Institute, Hubrecht Institute, Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences (KNAW) and University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Clinical Chemistry, Erasmus MC, University Medical Center Rotterdam, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Clinical Chemistry, Amsterdam UMC, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Clinical Chemistry, Amsterdam UMC, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Oncode Institute, Hubrecht Institute, Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences (KNAW) and University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Amsterdam Rheumatology and Immunology Center, Department of Rheumatology, Amsterdam UMC, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Clinical Chemistry, Amsterdam UMC, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Oncode Institute, Hubrecht Institute, Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences (KNAW) and University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200518,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['Q573I9DVLP (Leucovorin)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Child', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leucovorin/administration & dosage', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Mouth Mucosa/*drug effects/pathology', 'Organ Culture Techniques', 'Organoids/drug effects/*pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Stomatitis/chemically induced/*pathology']",PMC7233536,,,2020/05/19 06:00,2020/07/28 06:00,['2020/05/19 06:00'],"['2019/11/21 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/05/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/28 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0231588 [doi]', 'PONE-D-19-32380 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2020 May 18;15(5):e0231588. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0231588. eCollection 2020.,['ORCID: 0000-0001-9871-1887'],"['H.C. is an inventor on several patents related to organoid technology.

The incorporation of pediatric-type regimens has improved survival in young adults, and the incorporation of tyrosine kinase inhibitors for patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive disease has led to further improvements in outcomes. However, older patients often have poor-risk biology and reduced tolerance to chemotherapy, leading to lower remission rates and overall survival. Regardless of age, patients with relapsed or refractory ALL have extremely poor outcomes. The advent of next-generation sequencing has facilitated the revolution in understanding the genetics of ALL. New genetic risk stratification together with the ability to measure minimal residual disease, leukemic blasts left behind after cytotoxic chemotherapy, has led to better tools to guide postremission approaches-that is, consolidation chemotherapy or allogeneic stem cell transplantation. In this article, we discuss the evolving and complex genetic landscape of ALL and the emerging therapeutic options for patients with relapsed/refractory ALL and older patients with ALL.","['DeAngelo, Daniel J', 'Jabbour, Elias', 'Advani, Anjali']","['DeAngelo DJ', 'Jabbour E', 'Advani A']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.', 'The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Cleveland Clinic Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland, OH.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Am Soc Clin Oncol Educ Book,American Society of Clinical Oncology educational book.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: From 1999 to 2012, 361 patients with untreated HB were enrolled. PRETEXT I/II patients were treated with up-front resection, followed by low-dose CITA (stratum 1) or received low-dose CITA, followed by surgery and postoperative chemotherapy (stratum 2). In the remaining patients, after 2 cycles of CITA, responders received the CITA regimen before resection (stratum 3), and nonresponders were switched to ifosfamide, pirarubicin, etoposide, and carboplatin (ITEC; stratum 4). Intensified chemotherapeutic regimens with autologous hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (SCT) after resection were an optional treatment for patients with refractory/metastatic disease. RESULTS: The 5-year event-free and overall survival rates of HB patients were 74.2% and 89.9%, respectively, for stratum 1, 84.8% and 90.8%%, respectively, for stratum 2, 71.6% and 85.9%%, respectively, for stratum 3, and 59.1% and 67.3%%, respectively, for stratum 4. The outcomes for CITA responders were significantly better than those for nonresponders, whose outcomes remained poor despite salvage therapy with a second-line ITEC regimen or SCT. The late effects, ototoxicity, cardiotoxicity, and delayed growth, occurred in 61, 18, and 47 patients, respectively. Thirteen secondary malignant neoplasms (SMNs), including 10 leukemia, occurred, correlating with higher exposure to pirarubicin and younger age at diagnosis. CONCLUSION: The JPLT-2 protocol achieved up-front resectability in PRETEXT I/II patients with no annotation factors, and satisfactory survival in patients who were CITA responders in the remaining patients. However, outcomes for CITA nonresponders were unsatisfactory, despite therapy intensification with ITEC regimens and SCT. JPLT-2 had a relatively low incidence of cardiotoxicity but high rates of SMNs.","['Hiyama, Eiso', 'Hishiki, Tomoro', 'Watanabe, Kenichiro', 'Ida, Kohmei', 'Ueda, Yuka', 'Kurihara, Sho', 'Yano, Michihiro', 'Hoshino, Ken', 'Yokoi, Akiko', 'Takama, Yuichi', 'Nogami, Yuki', 'Taguchi, Tomoaki', 'Mori, Makiko', 'Kihira, Kentaro', 'Miyazaki, Osamu', 'Fuji, Hiroshi', 'Honda, Shohei', 'Iehara, Tomoko', 'Kazama, Takuro', 'Fujimura, Junya', 'Tanaka, Yukichi', 'Inoue, Takeshi', 'Tajiri, Tatsuro', 'Kondo, Satoshi', 'Oue, Takaharu', 'Yoshimura, Kenichi']","['Hiyama E', 'Hishiki T', 'Watanabe K', 'Ida K', 'Ueda Y', 'Kurihara S', 'Yano M', 'Hoshino K', 'Yokoi A', 'Takama Y', 'Nogami Y', 'Taguchi T', 'Mori M', 'Kihira K', 'Miyazaki O', 'Fuji H', 'Honda S', 'Iehara T', 'Kazama T', 'Fujimura J', 'Tanaka Y', 'Inoue T', 'Tajiri T', 'Kondo S', 'Oue T', 'Yoshimura K']","['Natural Science Center for Basic Research and Development, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatric Surgery, Hiroshima University Hospital, Hiroshima, Japan.', ""Children's Cancer Center, National Center for Child Health and Development, Tokyo, Japan."", 'National Cancer Center Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', ""Shizuoka Children's Hospital, Shizuoka, Japan."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Teikyo University Mizonokuchi Hospital, Kawasaki, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatric Surgery, Hiroshima University Hospital, Hiroshima, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatric Surgery, Hiroshima University Hospital, Hiroshima, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Akita University School of Medicine, Akita, Japan.', 'School of Medicine, Keio University, Tokyo, Japan.', ""Department of Pediatric Surgery, Kobe Children's Hospital, Kobe, Hyogo, Japan."", 'Department of Pediatric Surgery, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.', 'National Cancer Center Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatric Surgery, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan.', ""Departments of Hematology/Oncology, Saitama Children's Medical Center, Saitama, Japan."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Mie University Graduate School of Medicine, Mie, Japan.', ""Children's Cancer Center, National Center for Child Health and Development, Tokyo, Japan."", ""Children's Cancer Center, National Center for Child Health and Development, Tokyo, Japan."", 'Department of Gastroenterological Surgery I, Hokkaido University Graduate School of Medicine, Sapporo, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Graduate School of Medicine, Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatric Surgery, Graduate School of Medicine, Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Juntendo University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', ""Department of Pathology, Kanagawa Children's Medical Center, Yokohama, Japan."", 'Department of Pathology, Osaka City General Hospital, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatric Surgery, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, Graduate School of Medical Science, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Division of Pediatric Surgery and Transplant Surgery, Nagoya City University Medical School, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatric Surgery, Hyogo College of Medicine, Hyogo, Japan.', 'Center for Integrated Medical Research, Hiroshima University Hospital, Hiroshima, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200518,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*mortality', 'Hepatectomy/*mortality', 'Hepatoblastoma/*mortality/pathology/therapy', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Liver Neoplasms/*mortality/pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Non-Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Postoperative Complications/etiology/*mortality/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Survival Rate']",,,,2020/05/19 06:00,2021/02/16 06:00,['2020/05/19 06:00'],"['2020/05/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/16 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/19 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.19.01067 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2020 Aug 1;38(22):2488-2498. doi: 10.1200/JCO.19.01067.

However, the prognosis mostly remains poor and aside from allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation no curative treatment options exist. Unlike acute myeloid leukemia, which has seen a dramatic expansion of available therapies recently, no new agents have been approved for MDS in the United States since 2006. However, various novel HMAs, HMA in combination with venetoclax, immune checkpoint inhibitors, and targeted therapies for genetically defined patient subgroups such as APR-246 or IDH inhibitors, have shown promising results in early stages of clinical testing. Furthermore, the wider availability of genetic testing is going to allow for a more individualized treatment of MDS patients. Herein, we review the current treatment approach for HR-MDS and discuss recent therapeutic advances and the implications of genetic testing on management of HR-MDS.","['Bewersdorf, Jan Philipp', 'Zeidan, Amer M']","['Bewersdorf JP', 'Zeidan AM']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Section of Hematology, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Section of Hematology, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA.']",['eng'],"['P30 CA016359/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 TR001863/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20200518,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/therapeutic use', 'Azacitidine/therapeutic use', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/drug therapy/genetics', '*Myelodysplastic Syndromes/drug therapy/genetics']",PMC7670856,['NOTNLM'],"['*MDS', '*Myelodysplastic syndrome', '*combination therapy', '*hypomethylating agent', '*immune checkpoint inhibition']",2020/05/19 06:00,2021/04/28 06:00,['2020/05/19 06:00'],"['2020/05/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/28 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/19 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10428194.2020.1761968 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2020 Oct;61(10):2295-2312. doi: 10.1080/10428194.2020.1761968.

They are widely found in fruits and vegetables. The polyphenols quercetin and curcumin have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-carcinogenic, and pro-apoptotic properties. They were successfully used against different human cancers, especially chronic myeloid leukemia cancer cells. We have previously investigated anti-proliferative and apoptotic effects of quercetin and curcumin combination in K562 cells. Our data showed that they had beneficial synergistic effects. Based on these findings, we aimed to clarify signaling pathways involved in synergistic combination treatment with quercetin and curcumin in these cells. Proteins were investigated by Western blotting and by confocal microscopy. Changes in several genes in 10 different pathways related to cell proliferation, apoptosis, cell cycle, inflammation, hypoxia and oxidative stress were observed. Combination of quercetin and curcumin was effective on genes that were particularly related to p53, NF-kappaB and TGF-alpha pathways. Down-regulatory (CDKN1B, AKT1, IFN-gamma) and up-regulatory (BTG2, CDKN1A, FAS) effects on genes and related protein expressions may provide a multi-targeted therapy potential for chronic myeloid leukemia cancer cells without affecting healthy cells.","['Mutlu Altundag, Ergul', 'Yilmaz, Ayse Mine', 'Serdar, Belgin Sert', 'Jannuzzi, Ayse Tarbin', 'Kocturk, Semra', 'Yalcin, A Suha']","['Mutlu Altundag E', 'Yilmaz AM', 'Serdar BS', 'Jannuzzi AT', 'Kocturk S', 'Yalcin AS']","['Faculty of Medicine, Department of Biochemistry, Eastern Mediterranean University, Famagusta, Cyprus.', 'Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine/Genetic and Metabolic Diseases Research and Investigation Center, Marmara University, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Department of Biochemistry, Dokuz Eylul University, Izmir, Turkey.', 'Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine/Genetic and Metabolic Diseases Research and Investigation Center, Marmara University, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Faculty of Pharmacy, Department of Pharmaceutical Toxicology, Istanbul University, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Department of Biochemistry, Dokuz Eylul University, Izmir, Turkey.', 'Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine/Genetic and Metabolic Diseases Research and Investigation Center, Marmara University, Istanbul, Turkey.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200518,United States,Nutr Cancer,Nutrition and cancer,7905040,"['0 (Immediate-Early Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '141490-22-4 (BTG2 protein, human)', '9IKM0I5T1E (Quercetin)', 'IT942ZTH98 (Curcumin)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', '*Curcumin/pharmacology', 'Humans', '*Immediate-Early Proteins', 'K562 Cells', '*Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy', 'Quercetin/pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",,,,2020/05/19 06:00,2021/08/19 06:00,['2020/05/19 06:00'],"['2020/05/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/19 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/19 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/01635581.2020.1767167 [doi]'],ppublish,Nutr Cancer. 2021;73(4):703-712. doi: 10.1080/01635581.2020.1767167.

ATP citrate lyase (ACLY) is a key metabolic enzyme that catalyzes the generation of Acetyl-CoA and is upregulated in cancer cells and required for their growth. The phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and Src-family kinase (SFK) Lyn are constitutively activate in many cancers. We show here, for the first time, that both the substrate and product of PI3K, phosphatidylinositol-(4,5)-bisphosphate (PIP2) and phosphatidylinositol-(3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP3), respectively, bind to ACLY in Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) patient-derived, but not normal donor-derived cells. We demonstrate the binding of PIP2 to the CoA-binding domain of ACLY and identify the six tyrosine residues of ACLY that are phosphorylated by Lyn. Three of them (Y682, Y252, Y227) can be also phosphorylated by Src and they are located in catalytic, citrate binding and ATP binding domains, respectively. PI3K and Lyn inhibitors reduce the ACLY enzyme activity, ACLY-mediated Acetyl-CoA synthesis, phospholipid synthesis, histone acetylation and cell growth. Thus, PIP2/PIP3 binding and Src tyrosine kinases-mediated stimulation of ACLY links oncogenic pathways to Acetyl-CoA-dependent pro-growth and survival metabolic pathways in cancer cells. These results indicate a novel function for Lyn, as a regulator of Acetyl-CoA-mediated metabolic pathways.","['Basappa, Johnvesly', 'Citir, Mevlut', 'Zhang, Qian', 'Wang, Hong Y', 'Liu, Xiaobin', 'Melnikov, Olga', 'Yahya, Hafiz', 'Stein, Frank', 'Muller, Rainer', 'Traynor-Kaplan, Alexis', 'Schultz, Carsten', 'Wasik, Mariusz A', 'Ptasznik, Andrzej']","['Basappa J', 'Citir M', 'Zhang Q', 'Wang HY', 'Liu X', 'Melnikov O', 'Yahya H', 'Stein F', 'Muller R', 'Traynor-Kaplan A', 'Schultz C', 'Wasik MA', 'Ptasznik A']","['Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL), 69117, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL), 69117, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL), 69117, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'ATK Innovation, Analytics and Discovery and University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL), 69117, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Oregon Health and Science University (OHSU), Portland, OR, USA.', 'Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, PA, USA.']",['eng'],['R01 GM127631/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],['Journal Article'],20200507,England,Heliyon,Heliyon,101672560,,,,PMC7218026,['NOTNLM'],"['ACLY', 'Acetyl-CoA', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological sciences', 'Cancer', 'Cancer research', 'Health sciences', 'Lyn', 'Metabolism', 'PI3K', 'Src']",2020/05/19 06:00,2020/05/19 06:01,['2020/05/19 06:00'],"['2020/04/21 00:00 [received]', '2020/04/26 00:00 [revised]', '2020/04/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/05/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/19 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e03910 [doi]', 'S2405-8440(20)30755-6 [pii]', 'e03910 [pii]']",epublish,Heliyon. 2020 May 7;6(5):e03910. doi: 10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e03910. eCollection 2020 May.,,,['(c) 2020 The Author(s).'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Almost 95% of children potentially achieve a complete remission after the induction treatment, but over the last years, new insights in the genomic disease profile and in minimal residual disease detection techniques have led to an improvement in the prognostic stratification, identifying selected patients' subgroups with peculiar therapeutic needs. AREAS COVERED: According to a comprehensive search of peer-review literature performed in Pubmed, in this review we summarize the recent evidences on the induction treatment strategies comprised in the children acute lymphoblastic leukemia scenario, focusing on the role of key drugs such as corticosteroids and asparaginase and discussing the crucial significance of the genomic characterization at baseline which may drive the proper induction treatment choice. EXPERT OPINION: Current induction strategies already produce durable remissions in a significant proportion of standard-risk children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. A broader knowledge of the biologic features related to acute lymphoblastic leukemia subtypes with worse prognosis, and an optimization of targeted drugs now available, might lead to the achievement of long-term molecular remissions in this setting.","['Capria, Saveria', 'Molica, Matteo', 'Mohamed, Sara', 'Bianchi, Simona', 'Moleti, Maria Luisa', 'Trisolini, Silvia Maria', 'Chiaretti, Sabina', 'Testi, Anna Maria']","['Capria S', 'Molica M', 'Mohamed S', 'Bianchi S', 'Moleti ML', 'Trisolini SM', 'Chiaretti S', 'Testi AM']","['Hematology, Department of Translational and Precision Medicine, \'Sapienza"" University of Rome , Rome, Italy.', 'Hematology, Department of Translational and Precision Medicine, \'Sapienza"" University of Rome , Rome, Italy.', 'Hematology, Department of Translational and Precision Medicine, \'Sapienza"" University of Rome , Rome, Italy.', 'Hematology, Department of Translational and Precision Medicine, \'Sapienza"" University of Rome , Rome, Italy.', 'Hematology, Department of Translational and Precision Medicine, \'Sapienza"" University of Rome , Rome, Italy.', 'Hematology, Department of Translational and Precision Medicine, \'Sapienza"" University of Rome , Rome, Italy.', 'Hematology, Department of Translational and Precision Medicine, \'Sapienza"" University of Rome , Rome, Italy.', 'Hematology, Department of Translational and Precision Medicine, \'Sapienza"" University of Rome , Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Review']",20200601,England,Expert Rev Hematol,Expert review of hematology,101485942,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Factors', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms/prevention & control/secondary/therapy', 'Child', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Combined Modality Therapy/adverse effects/methods', 'Comorbidity', 'Disease Management', 'Disease Susceptibility', 'Humans', 'Neoplasm, Residual/diagnosis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/etiology/*mortality/*therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction/methods', 'Treatment Outcome']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*adolescents', '*asparaginase', '*children', '*dexamethasone', '*induction strategies', '*minimal residual disease', '*tyrosine kinase inhibitors']",2020/05/19 06:00,2021/05/27 06:00,['2020/05/19 06:00'],"['2020/05/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/27 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/19 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/17474086.2020.1770591 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Rev Hematol. 2020 Jul;13(7):755-769. doi: 10.1080/17474086.2020.1770591.

However, platelet transfusion refractoriness (PTR) is an intractable clinical issue occurred in these patients. And its clinical and immunological features remain largely unknown. The potential causes and clinical features of PTR were retrospectively analyzed in 560 patients who were diagnosed as de novo AML in Tongji Hospital from June 2012 through June 2018. A high-throughput antibody screening for the detection of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) and its serotypes was performed in 133 newly diagnosed AML patients. PTR occurred in 11.8% of the de novo AML patients. The median age for patients with PTR was 46 years (range, 15-70). It frequently manifested in female patients and in patients with splenomegaly, M4 subtype, c-Kit gene mutation, and rearrangements of RUNX1-RUNX1T1 or CBFB-MYH11, commonly referred to as core binding factor AML (CBF-AML). Notably, CBF-AML was independently associated with the occurrence of PTR. PTR predominantly developed in patients who had CBF-AML (P < .001) and in patients who further had better minimal residual disease (MRD) reduction (>/=3-log) before the second consolidation chemotherapy (P = .007). HLA-I antibodies were detected in the serum of 9.0% of AML patients and markedly enriched in patients with PTR (P < .001) and in patients with CBF-AML (P = .018). HLA-B was the most frequently identified serum epitope in PTR patients. Patients with CBF-AML had higher tendency to develop HLA-I antibodies and PTR, which depicted novel features of PTR in AML and might provide insights into its efficient managements.","['Hu, Xuelian', 'Cai, Haodong', 'Zheng, Lu', 'Luo, Yi', 'Zhou, Jing', 'Hui, Yan', 'Dai, Zhenyu', 'Lin, Haolong', 'Li, Dengju', 'Xiao, Yi', 'Huang, Liang', 'Zhou, Jianfeng']","['Hu X', 'Cai H', 'Zheng L', 'Luo Y', 'Zhou J', 'Hui Y', 'Dai Z', 'Lin H', 'Li D', 'Xiao Y', 'Huang L', 'Zhou J']","['Department of Hematology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', ""Lishui City People's Hospital, Zhejiang, China."", 'Department of Hematology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200518,United States,Cancer Med,Cancer medicine,101595310,,IM,"['Adult', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Platelet Transfusion/*methods', 'Risk Factors']",PMC7367618,['NOTNLM'],"['*core binding factor acute myeloid leukemia', '*human leukocyte antigen', '*platelet transfusion refractoriness', '*risk factor']",2020/05/19 06:00,2021/05/14 06:00,['2020/05/19 06:00'],"['2019/12/21 00:00 [received]', '2020/04/13 00:00 [revised]', '2020/04/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/14 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/19 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cam4.3140 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Med. 2020 Jul;9(14):4941-4948. doi: 10.1002/cam4.3140.

However, most of these reports were in the pre-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) era. Recent limited reports indicate improved outcomes for MPAL with the addition of TKIs. We examined the outcomes of 241 cases of MPAL according to the 2008 WHO classification from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results registry. The MLL+ patients had a median age of 6 years while other subtypes occurred mostly in adults and had comparable age. On multivariate analyses and after adjustment for age, year of diagnosis and chemotherapy status, Ph+ MPAL patients had reduced risk of death in comparison to Ph(-) MPAL patients (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.28, P = .002). So, MLL+ MPAL had the worst outcome with a 10-fold increased risk of death in comparison to Ph+ MPAL patients (HR = 10.2, P < .001). Importantly, the outcome of Ph+ MPAL was comparable to Ph+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia in a 1:1 matched case-control analysis. In conclusion, this is the largest registry study which examines the outcomes of MPAL subtypes. We confirm that MPAL is a heterogenous disease. Note, Ph+ MPAL nowadays has a better OS in comparison to other subtypes and is comparable to Ph+ ALL patients. This is most likely secondary to changes in practice and more utilization of TKIs. On the other hand, MLL rearrangement is associated with infantile MPAL and has a dismal prognosis.","['Qasrawi, Ayman', 'Ramlal, Reshma', 'Munker, Reinhold', 'Hildebrandt, Gerhard C']","['Qasrawi A', 'Ramlal R', 'Munker R', 'Hildebrandt GC']","['Division of Hematology, Blood & Marrow Transplantation, University of Kentucky Medical Center, Markey Cancer Center, Lexington, Kentucky.', 'Division of Hematology, Blood & Marrow Transplantation, University of Kentucky Medical Center, Markey Cancer Center, Lexington, Kentucky.', 'Division of Hematology, Blood & Marrow Transplantation, University of Kentucky Medical Center, Markey Cancer Center, Lexington, Kentucky.', 'Division of Hematology, Blood & Marrow Transplantation, University of Kentucky Medical Center, Markey Cancer Center, Lexington, Kentucky.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200628,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*mortality/therapy', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate', 'United States/epidemiology']",,,,2020/05/19 06:00,2020/12/30 06:00,['2020/05/19 06:00'],"['2020/04/05 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/05 00:00 [revised]', '2020/05/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/30 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/19 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.25873 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2020 Sep;95(9):1015-1021. doi: 10.1002/ajh.25873.

We examined whether UGT2B17, the predominant lymphoid glucuronosyltransferase, affects leukaemic drug response and is involved in the metabolic inactivation of anti-leukaemic agents. METHODS: Functional enzymatic assays and patients' plasma samples were analysed by mass-spectrometry to evaluate drug inactivation by UGT2B17. Cytotoxicity assays and RNA sequencing were used to assess drug response and transcriptome changes associated with high UGT2B17 levels. RESULTS: High UGT2B17 in B-cell models led to reduced sensitivity to fludarabine, ibrutinib and idelalisib. UGT2B17 expression in leukaemic cells involved a non-canonical promoter and was induced by short-term treatment with these anti-leukaemics. Glucuronides of both fludarabine and ibrutinib were detected in CLL patients on respective treatment, however UGT2B17 conjugated fludarabine but not ibrutinib. AMP-activated protein kinase emerges as a pathway associated with high UGT2B17 in fludarabine-treated patients and drug-treated cell models. The expression changes linked to UGT2B17 exposed nuclear factor kappa B as a key regulatory hub. CONCLUSIONS: Data imply that UGT2B17 represents a mechanism altering drug response in CLL through direct inactivation but would also involve additional mechanisms for drugs not inactivated by UGT2B17.","['Allain, Eric P', 'Rouleau, Michele', 'Vanura, Katrina', 'Tremblay, Sophie', 'Vaillancourt, Joanie', 'Bat, Vincent', 'Caron, Patrick', 'Villeneuve, Lyne', 'Labriet, Adrien', 'Turcotte,

We systematically reviewed reports on radiation exposure (RE) during PAE in the literature and estimated the risk RE poses using a Monte Carlo dose calculation algorithm. Of 842 studies screened, 22 were included. The overall mean dose area product (DAP) was 181.6 Gycm(2) (95% confidence interval 125.7-262.4). The risk model for the effects of RE in a 66-yr-old patient exposed to DAP of 200 Gycm(2) showed that the probability of cancer death from the intervention was 0.117%. The highest specific lifetime risk was expected for leukaemia (0.061%). Wide DAP variation between individual studies (medians ranging from 33.2 to 863.4 Gycm(2)) indicate large potential to reduce RE during PAE at some study centres. RE must be included in patient counselling on PAE, especially for younger patients. PATIENT SUMMARY: We systematically assessed radiation exposure during prostatic artery embolisation (PAE) in the literature and simulated the associated risks in a computer model. PAE exposes patients to very low but not negligible risks, which are most relevant for younger men. This should be discussed with patients before PAE.","['Zumstein, Valentin', 'Binder, Jorg', 'Gusewell, Sabine', 'Betschart, Patrick', 'Pratsinis, Manolis', 'Mullhaupt, Gautier', 'Hechelhammer, Lukas', 'Schmid, Hans-Peter', 'Abt, Dominik']","['Zumstein V', 'Binder J', 'Gusewell S', 'Betschart P', 'Pratsinis M', 'Mullhaupt G', 'Hechelhammer L', 'Schmid HP', 'Abt D']","['Department of Urology, Kantonsspital St. Gallen, St. Gallen, Switzerland.', 'Radiation Protection Unit, Kantonsspital Aarau, Aarau, Switzerland.', 'Biostatistics, Clinical Trials Unit, Kantonsspital St. Gallen, St. Gallen, Switzerland.', 'Department of Urology, Kantonsspital St. Gallen, St. Gallen, Switzerland.', 'Department of Urology, Kantonsspital St. Gallen, St. Gallen, Switzerland.', 'Department of Urology, Kantonsspital St. Gallen, St. Gallen, Switzerland.', 'Department of Radiology and Nuclear Medicine, Kantonsspital St. Gallen, St. Gallen, Switzerland.', 'Department of Urology, Kantonsspital St. Gallen, St. Gallen, Switzerland.', 'Department of Urology, Kantonsspital St. Gallen, St. Gallen, Switzerland.

It has an indolent course with relapse and remission periods. The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical characteristics and risk factors affecting the outcome of patients with hairy cell leukemia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The retrospective data of 65 patients were evaluated according to initial hematologic and biochemical parameters, response rates, progression-free survival, and overall survival. Factors effecting response and survival rates were analyzed. RESULTS: The median follow-up duration was 62.8 months (range, 5.7-229.3 months). The result of the analysis showed that the patients with relapse/progressive disease had higher lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels at the time of diagnosis than patients without relapse/progression (median [range], 243 [137-540] vs. 179 [99-334] U/L, P = .01). Patients with LDH >/= 200.5 IU at the time of diagnosis were demonstrated to have a shorter progression-free survival than those with LDH < 200.5 IU (P = .010). CONCLUSION: Serum LDH level is significantly associated with relapse/progression in hairy cell leukemia patients. Patients with higher LDH levels at diagnosis should be monitored closely even if they experience complete remission.","['Maral, Senem', 'Albayrak, Murat', 'Dagdas, Simten', 'Yildiz, Abdulkerim', 'Yildirim, Rahsan', 'Oz, Merih', 'Pala, Cigdem', 'Afacan Ozturk, Hacer Berna', 'Bay, Ilker', 'Ozet, Gulsum', 'Dilek, Imdat']","['Maral S', 'Albayrak M', 'Dagdas S', 'Yildiz A', 'Yildirim R', 'Oz M', 'Pala C', 'Afacan Ozturk HB', 'Bay I', 'Ozet G', 'Dilek I']","['Department of Hematology, Ankara Diskapi Yildirim Beyazit Research and Training Hospital, Ankara, Turkey.

OBJECTIVE: In a prospective study, the influence of CYP1A1*2C and CYP2D6*4 gene polymorphisms on the susceptibility to chronic myelocytic leukaemia (CML) were investigated. METHODS: Prevalence of CYP1A1*2C and CYP2D6*4 was detected in blood specimens from three hundred participants - two hundred patients and a hundred healthy individuals as a control group, using PCR-RFLP. RESULTS: CYP1A1 Ile/Val and Val/Val genotype frequency in our study population was 82% & 15% in CML patients and 55% & 8% in controls, respectively. This suggests that carriers had an elevated risk (OR=18.38, 95% CI=7.364-45.913, p value; =0.000 and OR=23.125,95 % CI=7.228-73.980, p value=0.000, respectively). Individuals carrying the CYP2D6 heterozygous genotype (IM) were notably fewer in number within the CML group at 43.5%, as opposed to 93% of the controls. This suggests that the IM genotype may have a prophylactic function in lowering CML risk (OR=0.036, 95% CI=0.005-0.271, p value =0.001). In spite of the distribution of the homozygous mutant (PM) genotype being higher in cases with CML (87% as opposed to 6% in the control), this difference was deemed non-significant (OR=0.558, 95% CI=0.064-4.845, p value =0.597). CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that polymorphic CYP1A1 and CYP2D6 genes affect the susceptibility to CML.","['Idris, Hadeil M E', 'Khalil, Hiba B', 'Mills, Jeremy', 'Elderdery, Abozer Y']","['Idris HME', 'Khalil HB', 'Mills J', 'Elderdery AY']","['Faculty of Medical Laboratory Sciences, Al Neelain University, Khartoum, Sudan.', 'Faculty of Medical Laboratory Sciences, Al Neelain University, Khartoum, Sudan.', 'School of Pharmacy and Biomedical Sciences, University of Portsmouth, Portsmouth PO1 2UP, United Kingdom.', 'Faculty of Applied Medical Sciences, Jouf University, Sakaka, Saudi Arabia.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Netherlands,Curr Cancer Drug Targets,Current cancer drug targets,101094211,"['EC 1.14.14.1 (CYP1A1 protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A1)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6)']",IM,"['Case-Control Studies', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A1/*genetics', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6/*genetics', 'Female', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genotype', 'Heterozygote', 'Homozygote', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/epidemiology/*genetics', 'Male', '*Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Prospective Studies', 'Sudan/epidemiology']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*CML', '*CYP1A1', '*CYP2D6', '*Leukaemia', '*Sudan', '*polymorphisms']",2020/05/19 06:00,2021/09/18 06:00,['2020/05/19 06:00'],"['2020/02/06 00:00 [received]', '2020/04/06 00:00 [revised]', '2020/04/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/18 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/19 06:00 [entrez]']","['CCDT-EPUB-106723 [pii]', '10.2174/1570163817666200518081356 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Cancer Drug Targets. 2020;20(9):675-680. doi: 10.2174/1570163817666200518081356.,,,"['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.net.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The last two years have seen United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) approvals of the multi-kinase inhibitor midostaurin for newly-diagnosed FLT3-mutated patients, when used in combination with intensive chemotherapy, and of the more FLT3-selective agent gilteritinib, used as monotherapy, for patients with relapsed or treatment-refractory FLT3-mutated AML. The 'second generation' agents, quizartinib and crenolanib, are also at advanced stages of clinical development. Significant challenges remain in negotiating a variety of potential acquired drug resistance mechanisms and in optimizing sequencing of FLT3 inhibitory drugs with existing and novel treatment approaches in different clinical settings, including frontline therapy, relapsed/refractory disease, and maintenance treatment. In this review, the biology of FLT3, the clinical challenge posed by FLT3-mutated AML, the developmental history of the key FLT3-inhibitory compounds, mechanisms of disease resistance, and the future outlook for this group of agents, including current and planned clinical trials, is discussed.","['Hogan, Francesca L', 'Williams, Victoria', 'Knapper, Steven']","['Hogan FL', 'Williams V', 'Knapper S']","['Department of Haematology, University Hospital of Wales, Cardiff, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Haematology, University Hospital of Wales, Cardiff, United Kingdom.', 'School of Medicine, Cardiff University, Cardiff, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Netherlands,Curr Cancer Drug Targets,Current cancer drug targets,101094211,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Hematopoiesis/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/*genetics/metabolism', '*Mutation', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*administration & dosage', 'Recurrence', 'Treatment Outcome', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML)', '*FLT3 inhibitor', '*chemotherapy', '*gilteritinib main text', '*midostaurin', '*quizartinib']",2020/05/19 06:00,2021/07/08 06:00,['2020/05/19 06:00'],"['2019/10/21 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/12 00:00 [revised]', '2020/03/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/08 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/19 06:00 [entrez]']","['CCDT-EPUB-106722 [pii]', '10.2174/1570163817666200518075820 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Cancer Drug Targets. 2020;20(7):513-531. doi: 10.2174/1570163817666200518075820.,,,"['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.net.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The expression of CD25 and CD123 on blast cells in bone marrow samples were identified by flowcytometry in 94 patients ( 60 years old) with de novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML) treated at the Mansoura University Oncology Center (MUOC). RESULTS: Of the 94 samples at diagnosis there were 17 (18.1%) CD25+/CD123+ (double positive) cases; 25 (26.6%) CD25+/CD123- (single positive); 32 (34.0%) CD25-/CD123+ (single positive) cases; 20 (21.3%). CD25-/CD123- (double negative). Most of the AML patients have double CD25+/CD123+ were significantly associated with poor and intermediate risk as compared to those associated with those in the good risk group (P= 0.005). The lowest induction of remission was recorded in AML patients have double CD25+/CD123+ expression as compared to the remaining AML patient group. Study the effect of these biomarkers on the overall survival reveal that AML patients exhibited double CD25+/CD123+ expression had significantly shorter overall survival as compared to negative ones. CONCLUSION: Double CD25+/CD123+ co-expression in AML patients is a dismal prognostic marker and could be used as novel biomarker for risk stratification for AML patients.,"['Aref, Salah', 'Azmy, Emaad', 'El Ghannam, Doaa', 'Haroun, Marwa', 'Ibrahim, Lamiaa', 'Sabry, Mohamed']","['Aref S', 'Azmy E', 'El Ghannam D', 'Haroun M', 'Ibrahim L', 'Sabry M']","['Hematology Unit, Clinical Pathology Department, Mansoura University Oncology Center, Mansoura University, Mansoura, Egypt.', 'Clinical Hematology Unit, Mansoura University Oncology Center, Mansoura University, Mansoura, Egypt.', 'Hematology Unit, Clinical Pathology Department, Mansoura University Oncology Center, Mansoura University, Mansoura, Egypt.', 'Hematology Unit, Clinical Pathology Department, Mansoura University Oncology Center, Mansoura University, Mansoura, Egypt.', 'Hematology Unit, Clinical Pathology Department, Mansoura University Oncology Center, Mansoura University, Mansoura, Egypt.', 'Hematology Unit, Clinical Pathology Department, Mansoura University Oncology Center, Mansoura University, Mansoura, Egypt.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Netherlands,Cancer Biomark,Cancer biomarkers : section A of Disease markers,101256509,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Interleukin-2 Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Interleukin-3 Receptor alpha Subunit)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/genetics', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2 Receptor alpha Subunit/*genetics', 'Interleukin-3 Receptor alpha Subunit/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Young Adult']",,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'CD123', 'CD25', 'prognosis']",2020/05/18 06:00,2021/06/09 06:00,['2020/05/18 06:00'],"['2020/05/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/09 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/18 06:00 [entrez]']","['CBM201519 [pii]', '10.3233/CBM-201519 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Biomark. 2020;29(1):9-16. doi: 10.3233/CBM-201519.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After the fast protein crash with acetonitrile, chromatographic separation of ivosidenib and erlotinib (used as the internal standard in this experiment, IS) was accomplished using an Acquity BEH C18 (2.1mmx50mm, 1.7mum) column, and detection of the analyte was also performed using a Xevo TQ-S triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometer in the positive ion electrospray ionization (ESI) interface. The assay showed enough linearity over a 0.5-6000ng/mL calibration range. The application of the validated bioanalytical method based on the UHPLC-MS/MS technique was further successfully exhibited in an animal study of the drug-drug interaction between ivosidenib (50mg/kg) and voriconazole (20mg/kg)/itraconazole (20mg/kg)/fluconazole (20mg/kg) in rats. Voriconazole, itraconazole and fluconazole increased the exposure of ivosidenib in plasma by different degrees and also had a potential inhibitory effect on the metabolism of ivosidenib. Thus, a dose reduction or interruption of ivosidenib may be important to guide the practice of clinical medicine.","['Xie, Saili', 'Ye, Lei', 'Ye, Xuemei', 'Lin, Guanyang', 'Xu, Ren-Ai']","['Xie S', 'Ye L', 'Ye X', 'Lin G', 'Xu RA']","['The First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, 325000 Wenzhou, PR China.', 'The First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, 325000 Wenzhou, PR China.', 'The First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, 325000 Wenzhou, PR China.', 'The First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, 325000 Wenzhou, PR China.

It has previously been shown that ATPR could induce differentiation and inhibit proliferation of APL cells, although the mechanism responsible for this effect was not well understood. In this study, we demonstrated that ATPR remarkably inhibited the expression and activity of SHP2. Further experiments showed silencing SHP2 or using SHP2 inhibition (SHP099) enhanced the effect of ATPR on cell proliferation and maturation. In addition, we also demonstrated that Rho/ROCK1 might be regulated by SHP2. Using Y-27632, a ROCK inhibitor, further proved that ROCK1 played an important role in ATPR-induced differentiation and proliferation suppression. In conclusion, the results from this study revealed that ATPR induced APL cells terminal differentiation and growth arrest by blockade of SHP2/Rho/ ROCK1 pathway.","['Li, Lanlan', 'Xu, Xiaoling', 'Du, Yan', 'Zhang, Meiju', 'Feng, Yubin', 'Qian, Xuewen', 'Li, Shufang', 'Du, Tianxi', 'Peng, Xiaoqing', 'Chen, Feihu']","['Li L', 'Xu X', 'Du Y', 'Zhang M', 'Feng Y', 'Qian X', 'Li S', 'Du T', 'Peng X', 'Chen F']","['The Key Laboratory of Major Autoimmune Diseases of Anhui Province, Anhui Institute of Innovative Drugs, School of Pharmacy, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, Anhui, China; The Key Laboratory of Anti-inflammatory and Immune Medicines, Ministry of Education, Hefei, Anhui, China.', 'The Key Laboratory of Major Autoimmune Diseases of Anhui Province, Anhui Institute of Innovative Drugs, School of Pharmacy, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, Anhui, China; The Key Laboratory of Anti-inflammatory and Immune Medicines, Ministry of Education, Hefei, Anhui, China.', 'The Key Laboratory of Major Autoimmune Diseases of Anhui Province, Anhui Institute of Innovative Drugs, School of Pharmacy, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, Anhui, China; The Key Laboratory of Anti-inflammatory and Immune Medicines, Ministry of Education, Hefei, Anhui, China.', 'The Key Laboratory of Major Autoimmune Diseases of Anhui Province, Anhui Institute of Innovative Drugs, School of Pharmacy, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, Anhui, China; The Key Laboratory of Anti-inflammatory and Immune Medicines, Ministry of Education, Hefei, Anhui, China.', 'The Key Laboratory of Major Autoimmune Diseases of Anhui Province, Anhui Institute of Innovative Drugs, School of Pharmacy, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, Anhui, China; The Key Laboratory of Anti-inflammatory and Immune Medicines, Ministry of Education, Hefei, Anhui, China.', 'The Key Laboratory of Major Autoimmune Diseases of Anhui Province, Anhui Institute of Innovative Drugs, School of Pharmacy, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, Anhui, China; The Key Laboratory of Anti-inflammatory and Immune Medicines, Ministry of Education, Hefei, Anhui, China.', 'The Key Laboratory of Major Autoimmune Diseases of Anhui Province, Anhui Institute of Innovative Drugs, School of Pharmacy, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, Anhui, China; The Key Laboratory of Anti-inflammatory and Immune Medicines, Ministry of Education, Hefei, Anhui, China.', 'Laboratory Animal Center, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, Anhui Province 230032, China.', 'The Key Laboratory of Major Autoimmune Diseases of Anhui Province, Anhui Institute of Innovative Drugs, School of Pharmacy, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, Anhui, China; The Key Laboratory of Anti-inflammatory and Immune Medicines, Ministry of Education, Hefei, Anhui, China.', 'The Key Laboratory of Major Autoimmune Diseases of Anhui Province, Anhui Institute of Innovative Drugs, School of Pharmacy, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, Anhui, China; The Key Laboratory of Anti-inflammatory and Immune Medicines, Ministry of Education, Hefei, Anhui, China.

Thrombocytopenias or aplastic anemias can be treated today with THPO peptide mimetics (romiplostim) or small-molecule THPO receptor agonists (e.g., eltrombopag). These THPO mimetics were designed for human application; however, many preclinical studies are performed in murine models. We investigated the activation of wild-type murine MPL (mMPL) by romiplostim. Romiplostim stimulated AKT, ERK1/2, and STAT5 phosphorylation without preference for one of these pathways, however, with a four- to fivefold lower phosphorylation intensity at high concentration. Faster internalization of mMPL after romiplostim binding could be one explanation of reduced signaling. In vitro megakaryocyte differentiation, proliferation, and maturation by romiplostim was less efficient compared with stimulation with mTHPO. We further dissected mMPL signaling by lentiviral overexpression of mMPL mutants with tyrosine (Y)-to-phenylalanine (F) substitutions in the distal cytoplasmic tyrosines 582 (Y582F), 616 (Y616F), and 621 (Y621F) individually and in combination (Y616F_Y621F) and in truncated receptors lacking 53 (Delta53) or 69 (Delta69) C-terminal amino acids. Mutation at tyrosine residue Y582F caused a gain-of-function with baseline activation and increased ERK1/2 phosphorylation upon stimulation. In agreement with this, proliferation in Y582F-32D cells was increased, yet did not rescue in vitro megakaryopoiesis from Mpl-deficient cells. Y616F and Y621F mutated receptors exhibited strongly impaired ERK1/2 and decreased AKT signaling and conferred reduced proliferation to 32D cells upon mTHPO stimulation but a partial correction of immature megakaryopoiesis in vitro.","['Rommel, Marcel G E', 'Hoerster, Keven', 'Milde, Christian', 'Schenk, Franziska', 'Roser, Luise', 'Kohlscheen, Saskia', 'Heinz, Niels', 'Modlich, Ute']","['Rommel MGE', 'Hoerster K', 'Milde C', 'Schenk F', 'Roser L', 'Kohlscheen S', 'Heinz N', 'Modlich U']","['Research Group for Gene Modification in Stem Cells, Division of Veterinary Medicine, Paul-Ehrlich-Institut, Langen, Germany.', 'Research Group for Gene Modification in Stem Cells, Division of Veterinary Medicine, Paul-Ehrlich-Institut, Langen, Germany; Institute for Transfusion Medicine, University Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Research Group for Gene Modification in Stem Cells, Division of Veterinary Medicine, Paul-Ehrlich-Institut, Langen, Germany.', 'Research Group for Gene Modification in Stem Cells, Division of Veterinary Medicine, Paul-Ehrlich-Institut, Langen, Germany.', 'Research Group for Gene Modification in Stem Cells, Division of Veterinary Medicine, Paul-Ehrlich-Institut, Langen, Germany.', 'Research Group for Gene Modification in Stem Cells, Division of Veterinary Medicine, Paul-Ehrlich-Institut, Langen, Germany.', 'Research Group for Gene Modification in Stem Cells, Division of Veterinary Medicine, Paul-Ehrlich-Institut, Langen, Germany.', 'Research Group for Gene Modification in Stem Cells, Division of Veterinary Medicine, Paul-Ehrlich-Institut, Langen, Germany.

The current treatment regimens for aGVHD are associated with several side effects which necessitates the development of novel interventions that prevent aGVHD without precluding graft-versus-tumor effects. In the present study, we show that treatment of donor graft with plant steroidal lactone Withaferin A (WA) prior to transplantation markedly reduced aGVHD mediated damage in target organs without compromising the graft-versus.-tumor activity of the transplanted lymphocytes. WA abrogated post-transplant cytokine storm associated with allo-activation of donor lymphocytes. This was attributed to the ability of WA to inhibit early signaling events in T-cell activation including lymphoblast formation and activation of AKT/mTOR pathway. Mortality and morbidity related to allo-transplantation was significantly reduced in recipients of WA treated donor splenocytes compared to recipient of vehicle treated donor splenocytes. Further, WA treatment did not have any effect on reconstitution of lymphoid and myeloid lineages in recipients, resulting in stable and complete donor chimerism. In agreement with previous reports showing the effectiveness of WA in a mouse model of partial chimerism, our data further establishes that WA is able to attenuate aGVHD in an MHC-mismatched high dose chemo-conditioned murine model without compromising engraftment. This study provides compelling scientific basis for possible application of WA for prevention and treatment of aGVHD in patients receiving allo-BMT.","['Mehta, Miten', 'Gohil, Dievya', 'Khattry, Navin', 'Kumar, Rajiv', 'Sandur, Santosh', 'Sharma, Deepak', 'Checker, Rahul', 'Agarwal, Beamon', 'Jha, Dhruv', 'Majumdar, Anuradha', 'Gota, Vikram']","['Mehta M', 'Gohil D', 'Khattry N', 'Kumar R', 'Sandur S', 'Sharma D', 'Checker R', 'Agarwal B', 'Jha D', 'Majumdar A', 'Gota V']","['Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Bombay College of Pharmacy, Mumbai, India; Clinical Pharmacology laboratory, Advanced Centre for Treatment Research and Education in Cancer, Tata Memorial Centre, Navi Mumbai, India.', 'Clinical Pharmacology laboratory, Advanced Centre for Treatment Research and Education in Cancer, Tata Memorial Centre, Navi Mumbai, India.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Tata Memorial Centre, Mumbai, India.', 'Department of Pathology, Tata Memorial Hospital, Mumbai, India.', 'Radiation Biology & Health Science Division, Bio-science Group, Bhabha Atomic Research Centre, Mumbai, India.', 'Radiation Biology & Health Science Division, Bio-science Group, Bhabha Atomic Research Centre, Mumbai, India.', 'Radiation Biology & Health Science Division, Bio-science Group, Bhabha Atomic Research Centre, Mumbai, India.', 'Department of Hematopathology, Montefiore Medical Centre, New York, NY, United States.', 'Birla Institute of Technology, Mesra Ranchi, Ranchi, India.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Bombay College of Pharmacy, Mumbai, India.', 'Clinical Pharmacology laboratory, Advanced Centre for Treatment Research and Education in Cancer, Tata Memorial Centre, Navi Mumbai, India.

Biomarkers of TL, cytokinesis-block micronucleus (MN) frequency, and white blood cells (WBC) were measured. In total, 18 polymorphic sites in environmental response genes, including metabolic and DNA repair genes, were analyzed. Results indicate that benzene exposure led to a longer TL at a threshold of 32 mg/m(3)-year of cumulative exposure dose (CED). Furthermore, the TL was longer in members of the damaged group, when evaluated for MN frequency (P < 0.001) and reduced WBC (P < 0.001), than in those of the normal group.

Incomplete resection can lead to recurrence or growth into the cavernous sinus (CS). A 46-year-old woman with a history of childhood leukemia treated with chemotherapy and whole-body radiotherapy had presented to an outside institution in 2004 with headache and vision changes and undergone subtotal resection for right sphenoorbital meningioma. Residual tumor growth caused progressive optic neuropathy, and she underwent multiple orbital decompressions and fractionated radiotherapy. In 2017, she underwent another craniotomy for repeat resection. Additional tumor growth causing neuropathic facial pain syndrome and progressive ophthalmoplegia was treated with orbital enucleation. On referral to our institution, magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated right sphenoorbital and CS meningioma extending into the sella and nearly to the medial border of the contralateral CS. Given her complete ophthalmoplegia and recent orbital enucleation, she underwent revision right frontotemporal craniotomy for radical resection of invasive meningioma, including right internal carotid artery occlusion and CS resection (Video 1). The skull-base defect was repaired with autologous fascia and a free muscle flap. Postoperative transient aphasia and left hemiparesis resolved over several days. At the 1-month follow-up examination, she was neurologically intact, with moderate improvement of facial pain syndrome (preoperative pain score, 9 of 10; postoperative pain score, 6 of 10). Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated gross total resection. Pathological tissue analysis was consistent with grade 1 meningioma with an increased MIB-1 proliferative index, although, clinically, the tumor behaved more malignantly.

Chemotherapy and/or HSC transplantation is unsatisfactory due to serious side effects, multidrug resistance, and high relapse rate. Thus, alternative strategies are urgently needed to develop more effective therapies. Liriope muscari baily saponins C (DT-13) is a novel compound isolated from Liriope muscari (Decne.) Baily, and exhibited a potent cytotoxicity against several solid tumors. However, the anti-AML activity of DT-13 and the potential mechanisms are still unknown. This study is the first to demonstrate that DT-13 had preferential cytotoxicity against AML cells, and remarkably inhibited proliferation and colony forming ability. Moreover, DT-13 induced the death receptor pathway-dependent apoptosis of HL-60 and Kasumi-1 cells by up-regulating Fas, FasL, DR5 and TRAIL as well as promoted the cleavage of caspase 8, caspase 3 and PARP. Meanwhile, DT-13 induced the differentiation with morphological change related to myeloid differentiation, elevated NBT and alpha-NAE positive cell rates, differentiation markers CD11b and CD14 as well as level of transcription factors C/EBPalpha and C/EBPbeta. RNA-sequencing analysis revealed that KLF2 may be one of the potential targets regulated by DT-13. Further studies indicated that KLF2 played a critical role in DT-13-induced apoptosis and differentiation. Moreover, activation of AMPK-FOXO was proved to be the upstream of KLF2 pathway that contributed to the induction of apoptosis and differentiation by DT-13. Additionally, restoration of KLF2 by DT-13 was highly correlated with the AMPK-related histone acetylation mechanisms. Finally, DT-13 exhibited an obvious anti-AML effect in NOD/SCID mice with the engraftment of HL-60 cells. Our study suggests that DT-13 may serve as a novel agent for AML by AMPL-KLF2-mediated apoptosis and differentiation.","['Wang, Chengqiang', 'He, Hui', 'Liu, Gen', 'Ma, Haoyue', 'Li, Li', 'Jiang, Mingdong', 'Lu, Qianwei', 'Li, Pan', 'Qi, Hongyi']","['Wang C', 'He H', 'Liu G', 'Ma H', 'Li L', 'Jiang M', 'Lu Q', 'Li P', 'Qi H']","['College of Pharmaceutical Sciences & College of Chinese Medicine, Southwest University, Chongqing 400715, China.', 'College of Pharmaceutical Sciences & College of Chinese Medicine, Southwest University, Chongqing 400715, China.', 'College of Pharmaceutical Sciences & College of Chinese Medicine, Southwest University, Chongqing 400715, China.', 'College of Pharmaceutical Sciences & College of Chinese Medicine, Southwest University, Chongqing 400715, China.', 'College of Pharmaceutical Sciences & College of Chinese Medicine, Southwest University, Chongqing 400715, China.', ""Department of Oncology and Hematology, Chongqing Ninth People's Hospital, Jialing Village 69, Beibei District, Chongqing 400700, China."", ""Department of Oncology and Hematology, Chongqing Ninth People's Hospital, Jialing Village 69, Beibei District, Chongqing 400700, China."", ""Department of Oncology and Hematology, Chongqing Ninth People's Hospital, Jialing Village 69, Beibei District, Chongqing 400700, China."", 'College of Pharmaceutical Sciences & College of Chinese Medicine, Southwest University, Chongqing 400715, China.

A subset of mitochondrial proteins is folded in the intermembrane space via the mitochondrial intermembrane assembly (MIA) pathway. We found increased mRNA expression of MIA pathway substrates in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) stem cells. Therefore, we evaluated the effects of inhibiting this pathway in AML. Genetic and chemical inhibition of ALR reduces AML growth and viability, disrupts LSC self-renewal, and induces their differentiation. ALR inhibition preferentially decreases its substrate COX17, a mitochondrial copper chaperone, and knockdown of COX17 phenocopies ALR loss. Inhibiting ALR and COX17 increases mitochondrial copper levels which in turn inhibit S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase (SAHH) and lower levels of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), DNA methylation, and chromatin accessibility to lower LSC viability. These results provide insight into mechanisms through which mitochondrial copper controls epigenetic status and viability of LSCs.","['Singh, Rashim Pal', 'Jeyaraju, Danny V', 'Voisin, Veronique', 'Hurren, Rose', 'Xu, Changjiang', 'Hawley, James R', 'Barghout, Samir H', 'Khan, Dilshad H', 'Gronda, Marcela', 'Wang, Xiaoming', 'Jitkova, Yulia', 'Sharon, David', 'Liyanagae, Sanduni', 'MacLean, Neil', 'Seneviratene, Ayesh K', 'Mirali, Sara', 'Borenstein, Adina', 'Thomas, Geethu E', 'Soriano, Joelle', 'Orouji, Elias', 'Minden, Mark D', 'Arruda, Andrea', 'Chan, Steven M', 'Bader, Gary D', 'Lupien, Mathieu', 'Schimmer, Aaron D']","['Singh RP', 'Jeyaraju DV', 'Voisin V', 'Hurren R', 'Xu C', 'Hawley JR', 'Barghout SH', 'Khan DH', 'Gronda M', 'Wang X', 'Jitkova Y', 'Sharon D', 'Liyanagae S', 'MacLean N', 'Seneviratene AK', 'Mirali S', 'Borenstein A', 'Thomas GE', 'Soriano J', 'Orouji E', 'Minden MD', 'Arruda A', 'Chan SM', 'Bader GD', 'Lupien M', 'Schimmer AD']","['Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'The Donnelly Centre, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'The Donnelly Centre, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'The Donnelly Centre, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.

Systematic screening of blood donors can prevent the transmission of HTLV-1 in blood. Gabon is one of the countries with the highest prevalence of HTLV-1 worldwide, and yet the routine testing of blood donors has still not been introduced. METHODS: All blood donations collected between April and July 2017 at the Centre National de Transfusion Sanguine of Gabon were studied. Plasma samples were screened by ELISA for the presence of HTLV-1/2 antibodies. Western blot (WB) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests were used for confirmation. RESULTS: In total, 3123 blood donors were tested, including 1740 repeat and 1378 first-time blood donors (FTBDs). Of them, 132 samples tested positive for HTLV-1/2 by ELISA (4.2%). WB and PCR confirmed HTLV-1 infection for 23 individuals. The overall prevalence of HTLV-1 was 0.74% [95% CI 0.47%-1.10%], 1% in FTBD, and 0.5% in repeat donors. Age and sex-adjusted prevalence was five-fold lower in FTBD than in the general adult population of rural areas of Gabon. All detected HTLV-1 strains belonged to the central African HTLV-1b genotype but were highly diverse. CONCLUSION: We report an overall prevalence of HTLV-1 of 0.74%, one of the highest values reported for blood donors in Africa. Given the high risk of HTLV-1 transmission in blood, it is necessary to conduct cost-effectiveness studies to determine the need and feasibility of implementing screening of HTLV-1 in blood donors in Gabon.","['Ramassamy, Jill-Lea', 'Cassar, Olivier', 'Toumbiri, Manoushka', 'Diane, Abdoulaye', 'Idam Mamimandjiami, Antony', 'Bengone, Calixte', 'Ntsame-Ndong, Jophrette Mireille', 'Mouinga-Ondeme, Augustin', 'Gessain, Antoine']","['Ramassamy JL', 'Cassar O', 'Toumbiri M', 'Diane A', 'Idam Mamimandjiami A', 'Bengone C', 'Ntsame-Ndong JM', 'Mouinga-Ondeme A', 'Gessain A']","[""Unite d'Epidemiologie et Physiopathologie des Virus Oncogenes, Departement de Virologie, Institut Pasteur, UMR 3569, CNRS, Paris, France."", 'Universite de Paris, Paris, France.', ""Unite d'Epidemiologie et Physiopathologie des Virus Oncogenes, Departement de Virologie, Institut Pasteur, UMR 3569, CNRS, Paris, France."", 'Unite des infections retrovirales et pathologies associees, Centre International de Recherches Medicales de Franceville, Franceville, Gabon.', 'Unite des infections retrovirales et pathologies associees, Centre International de Recherches Medicales de Franceville, Franceville, Gabon.', ""Unite d'Epidemiologie et Physiopathologie des Virus Oncogenes, Departement de Virologie, Institut Pasteur, UMR 3569, CNRS, Paris, France."", 'Unite des infections retrovirales et pathologies associees, Centre International de Recherches Medicales de Franceville, Franceville, Gabon.', ""Ecole Doctorale Regionale d'Afrique Centrale, Infectiologie Tropicale, Franceville, Gabon."", 'Centre National de Transfusion sanguine (CNTS), Libreville, Gabon.', 'Centre National de Transfusion sanguine (CNTS), Libreville, Gabon.', 'Unite des infections retrovirales et pathologies associees, Centre International de Recherches Medicales de Franceville, Franceville, Gabon.', ""Unite d'Epidemiologie et Physiopathologie des Virus Oncogenes, Departement de Virologie, Institut Pasteur, UMR 3569, CNRS, Paris, France.""]",['eng'],"['LabEx ANR10-LBX-62 IBEID/Agence Nationale de la Recherche', 'UMR 3569/Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique', 'FOOD/2016/379-660/European Commission']","['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20200515,United States,Transfusion,Transfusion,0417360,"['0 (Antigens, Viral)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antigens, Viral/*blood', '*Blood Donors', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'Gabon', '*Genotype', '*HTLV-I Infections/blood/epidemiology/genetics', '*Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prevalence']",PMC7496943,,,2020/05/18 06:00,2021/06/23 06:00,['2020/05/17 06:00'],"['2019/08/23 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/26 00:00 [revised]', '2020/03/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/23 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/17 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/trf.15838 [doi]'],ppublish,Transfusion. 2020 Jul;60(7):1483-1491. doi: 10.1111/trf.15838.

RECENT FINDINGS: Several case reports and series revealed new clinical, molecular, diagnostic, and therapeutic aspects of the disease. The clinical presentation diversity has been confirmed, with frequent leukemic non-cutaneous or rare atypical manifestations. The clonal evolution in the development of BPDCN has not been sufficiently elucidated. Although certain immunophenotypic markers (CD4, TCL1, CD123, CD56, CD303) are indicative of BPDCN, the diagnosis remains in certain cases challenging. Adult (ALL)-type chemotherapy followed by hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is related to a favorable outcome, while chemotherapy alone seems enough in children. Future studies should continue to investigate whether CD123-directed therapies could be utilized. BPDCN is a rare aggressive malignancy that needs an aggressive induction therapy. Although a diagnostic consensus is still lacking, and large retrospective studies are also needed to obtain standardized treatment guidelines, the future perspectives are encouraging, because of novel therapeutic agents that are under investigation.","['Tsagarakis, Nikolaos J', 'Paterakis, Georgios']","['Tsagarakis NJ', 'Paterakis G']","['Department of Immunology, ""G.

It requires indefinite administration which places emphasis on toxicity and long-term tolerance. RECENT FINDINGS: Extensive use of ibrutinib in studies and clinical practice has better defined its full toxicity profile which has made its use more challenging than initially foreseen. In particular, dysrhythmias, bleeding, infections and constitutional symptoms have been reported and can result in dose reduction or discontinuation of ibrutinib. Herein, we review the common as well as rare but important toxicities and discuss approach and management on a practical level. We also highlight that patients should be regularly monitored for adverse events and proactively treated to minimise side effects and avoid disruption.","['Lasica, Masa', 'Tam, Constantine S']","['Lasica M', 'Tam CS']","[""Department of Haematology, St Vincent's Hospital, Melbourne, Australia."", 'Department of Haematology, Eastern Health, Melbourne, Australia.', ""Department of Haematology, St Vincent's Hospital, Melbourne, Australia.

The maintenance of blood homeostasis requires a dynamic response of HSCs to stress, and dysregulation of these adaptive-response mechanisms underlies the development of myeloid leukaemia. Leukaemogenesis often occurs in a stepwise manner, with genetic and epigenetic changes accumulating in pre-leukaemic HSCs prior to the emergence of leukaemic stem cells (LSCs) and the development of acute myeloid leukaemia. Clinical data have revealed the existence of age-related clonal haematopoiesis, or the asymptomatic clonal expansion of mutated blood cells in the elderly, and this phenomenon is connected to susceptibility to leukaemic transformation. Here we describe how selection for specific mutations that increase HSC competitive fitness, in conjunction with additional endogenous and environmental changes, drives leukaemic transformation. We review the ways in which LSCs take advantage of normal HSC properties to promote survival and expansion, thus underlying disease recurrence and resistance to conventional therapies, and we detail our current understanding of leukaemic 'stemness' regulation. Overall, we link the cellular and molecular mechanisms regulating HSC behaviour with the functional dysregulation of these mechanisms in myeloid leukaemia and discuss opportunities for targeting LSC-specific mechanisms for the prevention or cure of malignant diseases.","['Yamashita, Masayuki', 'Dellorusso, Paul V', 'Olson, Oakley C', 'Passegue, Emmanuelle']","['Yamashita M', 'Dellorusso PV', 'Olson OC', 'Passegue E']","['Columbia Stem Cell Initiative, Department of Genetics & Development, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Division of Stem Cell and Molecular Medicine, Center for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Institute of Medical Science, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Columbia Stem Cell Initiative, Department of Genetics & Development, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Columbia Stem Cell Initiative, Department of Genetics & Development, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Columbia Stem Cell Initiative, Department of Genetics & Development, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA. ep2828@cumc.columbia.edu.']",['eng'],"['F31 HL151140/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R35 HL135763/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 HL120826/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20200515,England,Nat Rev Cancer,Nature reviews.

It is characterized by bone marrow lymphoid precursors that acquire genetic alterations, resulting in disrupted maturation and uncontrollable proliferation. More than a dozen molecular subtypes of variable severity can be used to classify cALL cases. Modern therapy protocols currently cure 85-90% of cases, but other patients are refractory or will relapse and eventually succumb to their disease. To better understand intratumor heterogeneity in cALL patients, we investigated the nature and extent of transcriptional heterogeneity at the cellular level by sequencing the transcriptomes of 39,375 individual cells in eight patients (six B-ALL and two T-ALL) and three healthy pediatric controls. We observed intra-individual transcriptional clusters in five out of the eight patients. Using pseudotime maturation trajectories of healthy B and T cells, we obtained the predicted developmental state of each leukemia cell and observed distribution shifts within patients. We showed that the predicted developmental states of these cancer cells are inversely correlated with ribosomal protein expression levels, which could be a common contributor to intra-individual heterogeneity in cALL patients.","['Caron, Maxime', 'St-Onge, Pascal', 'Sontag, Thomas', 'Wang, Yu Chang', 'Richer, Chantal', 'Ragoussis, Ioannis', 'Sinnett, Daniel', 'Bourque, Guillaume']","['Caron M', 'St-Onge P', 'Sontag T', 'Wang YC', 'Richer C', 'Ragoussis I', 'Sinnett D', 'Bourque G']","['Department of Human Genetics, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'CHU Sainte-Justine Research Center, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'CHU Sainte-Justine Research Center, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'CHU Sainte-Justine Research Center, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'McGill Genome Centre, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'CHU Sainte-Justine Research Center, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Department of Human Genetics, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'McGill Genome Centre, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'CHU Sainte-Justine Research Center, Montreal, Quebec, Canada. daniel.sinnett@umontreal.ca.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada. daniel.sinnett@umontreal.ca.', 'Department of Human Genetics, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada. guil.bourque@mcgill.ca.', 'McGill Genome Centre, Montreal, Quebec, Canada. guil.bourque@mcgill.ca.', 'Canadian Center for Computational Genomics, Montreal, Quebec, Canada. guil.bourque@mcgill.ca.']",['eng'],['245250 /CIHR/Canada'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200515,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Ribosomal Proteins)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics/metabolism', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', '*Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/classification/*genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Ribosomal Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Single-Cell Analysis/*methods', 'Whole Exome Sequencing/methods']",PMC7228968,,,2020/05/18 06:00,2020/12/01 06:00,['2020/05/17 06:00'],"['2019/12/05 00:00 [received]', '2020/04/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/05/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/01 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-020-64929-x [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-020-64929-x [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2020 May 15;10(1):8079. doi: 10.1038/s41598-020-64929-x.,,,,['Sci Rep. 2021 Mar 2;11(1):5414.

One of the ALDH family genes, ALDH1A2, is aberrantly expressed in more than 50% of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) cases. However, its molecular function and role in T-ALL pathogenesis are largely unknown. ChIP-seq and RNA-seq analyses showed that the oncogenic transcription factor TAL1 and its regulatory partners bind to the intronic regulatory element of the ALDH1A2 gene, directly inducing a T-ALL-specific isoform with enzymatic activity. ALDH1A2 was preferentially expressed in the TAL1-positive T-ALL subgroup. In T-ALL cell lines, depletion of ALDH1A2 inhibited cell viability and induced apoptosis. Interestingly, gene expression and metabolomic profiling revealed that ALDH1A2 supported glycolysis and the TCA cycle, accompanied by NADH production, by affecting multiple metabolic enzymes to promote ATP production. Depletion of ALDH1A2 increased the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), while ROS levels were reduced by ALDH1A2 overexpression both in vitro and in vivo. Overexpression of ALDH1A2 accelerated tumor onset and increased tumor penetrance in a zebrafish T-ALL model. Taken together, our results indicate that ALDH1A2 protects against intracellular stress and promotes T-ALL cell metabolism and survival. ALDH1A2 overexpression enables leukemic clones to sustain a hyper-proliferative state driven by oncogenes.","['Zhang, Chujing', 'Amanda, Stella', 'Wang, Cheng', 'King Tan, Tze', 'Zulfaqar Ali, Muhammad', 'Zhong Leong, Wei', 'Moy Ng, Ley', 'Kitajima, Shojiro', 'Li, Zhenhua', 'Eng Juh Yeoh, Allen', 'Hao Tan, Shi', 'Sanda, Takaomi']","['Zhang C', 'Amanda S', 'Wang C', 'King Tan T', 'Zulfaqar Ali M', 'Zhong Leong W', 'Moy Ng L', 'Kitajima S', 'Li Z', 'Eng Juh Yeoh A', 'Hao Tan S', 'Sanda T']","['Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore, Singapore.', 'Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore, Singapore.', 'Department of Anatomy, National University of Singapore, Singapore.', 'Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore, Singapore.', 'Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore, Singapore.', 'Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore, Singapore.', 'Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore, Singapore.', 'Institute for Advanced Biosciences, Keio University, Tsuruoka, Japan.', 'Department of Paediatrics, National University of Singapore, Singapore.', 'Dept of Paediatrics, National University of Singapore and Cancer Science Institute of Singapore.', 'Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore, Singapore.', 'Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore, Singapore.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210601,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 1.2.1.3 (Aldehyde Dehydrogenase)']",IM,"['*Aldehyde Dehydrogenase/genetics', 'Animals', '*Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'T-Lymphocytes', 'Transcription Factors', 'Zebrafish']",PMC8168519,,,2020/05/18 06:00,2021/07/08 06:00,['2020/05/17 06:00'],"['2019/12/18 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/08 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/17 06:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.2019.245639 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2019.245639 [doi]']",epublish,Haematologica. 2021 Jun 1;106(6):1545-1558. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2019.245639.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Venetoclax, a selective BCL-2 inhibitor, has limited monotherapy activity in relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia with no responses observed in a small subset of FLT3-ITD+ patients. Further, FLT3-ITD mutations emerged at relapse following venetoclax monotherapy and combination therapy suggesting a potential mechanism of resistance. Therefore, we investigated the convergence of FLT3-ITD signaling on the BCL-2 family proteins and determined combination activity of venetoclax and FLT3-ITD inhibition in preclinical models. In vivo, venetoclax combined with quizartinib, a potent FLT3 inhibitor, showed greater anti-tumor efficacy and prolonged survival compared to monotherapies. In a patient-derived FLT3-ITD+ xenograft model, cotreatment with venetoclax and quizartinib at clinically relevant doses had greater anti-tumor activity in the tumor microenvironment compared to quizartinib or venetoclax alone. Use of selective BCL-2 family inhibitors further identified a role for BCL-2, BCL-XL and MCL-1 in mediating survival in FLT3-ITD+ cells in vivo and highlighted the need to target all three proteins for greatest anti-tumor activity. Assessment of these combinations in vitro revealed synergistic combination activity for quizartinib and venetoclax but not for quizartinib combined with BCL-XL or MCL-1 inhibition. FLT3-ITD inhibition was shown to indirectly target both BCL-XL and MCL-1 through modulation of protein expression, thereby priming cells toward BCL-2 dependence for survival. These data demonstrate that FLT3-ITD inhibition combined with venetoclax has impressive anti-tumor activity in FLT3-ITD+ acute myeloid leukemia preclinical models and provides strong mechanistic rational for clinical studies.","['Singh Mali, Raghuveer', 'Zhang, Qi', 'DeFilippis, Rosa Anna', 'Cavazos, Antonio', 'Kuruvilla, Vinitha Mary', 'Raman, Jayant', 'Mody, Vidhi', 'Choo, Edna F', 'Dail, Monique', 'Shah, Neil P', 'Konopleva, Marina', 'Sampath, Deepak', 'Lasater, Elisabeth A']","['Singh Mali R', 'Zhang Q', 'DeFilippis RA', 'Cavazos A', 'Kuruvilla VM', 'Raman J', 'Mody V', 'Choo EF', 'Dail M', 'Shah NP', 'Konopleva M', 'Sampath D', 'Lasater EA']","['Department of Translational Oncology, Genentech, Inc., South San Francisco, CA, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, University of California at San Francisco, San Francisco, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, University of California at San Francisco, San Francisco, USA.', 'Department of Drug Metabolism and Pharmacokinetics, Genentech, Inc., South San Francisco, CA, USA.', 'Department of Drug Metabolism and Pharmacokinetics, Genentech, Inc., South San Francisco, CA, USA.', 'Oncology Biomarker Development, Genentech, Inc., South San Francisco, CA, USA.', 'Helen Diller Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of California at San Francisco, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Translational Oncology, Genentech, Inc., South San Francisco, CA, USA.', 'Department of Translational Oncology, Genentech, Inc., South San Francisco, CA, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210401,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'N54AIC43PW (venetoclax)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/genetics', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors', 'Sulfonamides/pharmacology', 'Tumor Microenvironment', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics']",PMC8017817,,,2020/05/18 06:00,2021/05/28 06:00,['2020/05/17 06:00'],"['2020/08/03 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/28 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/17 06:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.2019.244020 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2019.244020 [doi]']",epublish,Haematologica. 2021 Apr 1;106(4):1034-1046. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2019.244020.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Given the complexity of high-dimensional temporal genomic data, an analytic framework guided by a robust theory is needed to interpret time-sequential changes and to predict system dynamics. Here we model temporal dynamics of the transcriptome of peripheral blood mononuclear cells in a two-dimensional state-space representing states of health and leukemia using time-sequential bulk RNA-seq data from a murine model of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The state-transition model identified critical points that accurately predict AML development and identifies stepwise transcriptomic perturbations that drive leukemia progression. The geometry of the transcriptome state-space provided a biological interpretation of gene dynamics, aligned gene signals that are not synchronized in time across mice, and allowed quantification of gene and pathway contributions to leukemia development. Our state-transition model synthesizes information from multiple cell types in the peripheral blood and identifies critical points in the transition from health to leukemia to guide interpretation of changes in the transcriptome as a whole to predict disease progression. SIGNIFICANCE: These findings apply the theory of state transitions to model the initiation and development of acute myeloid leukemia, identifying transcriptomic perturbations that accurately predict time to disease development.See related commentary by Kuijjer, p. 3072 GRAPHICAL ABSTRACT: http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/canres/80/15/3157/F1.large.jpg.","['Rockne, Russell C', 'Branciamore, Sergio', 'Qi, Jing', 'Frankhouser, David E', ""O'Meally, Denis"", 'Hua, Wei-Kai', 'Cook, Guerry', 'Carnahan, Emily', 'Zhang, Lianjun', 'Marom, Ayelet', 'Wu, Herman', 'Maestrini, Davide', 'Wu, Xiwei', 'Yuan, Yate-Ching', 'Liu, Zheng', 'Wang, Leo D', 'Forman, Stephen', 'Carlesso, Nadia', 'Kuo, Ya-Huei', 'Marcucci, Guido']","['Rockne RC', 'Branciamore S', 'Qi J', 'Frankhouser DE', ""O'Meally D"", 'Hua WK', 'Cook G', 'Carnahan E', 'Zhang L', 'Marom A', 'Wu H', 'Maestrini D', 'Wu X', 'Yuan YC', 'Liu Z', 'Wang LD', 'Forman S', 'Carlesso N', 'Kuo YH', 'Marcucci G']","['Division of Mathematical Oncology, Department of Computational and Quantitative Medicine, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope Medical Center, Duarte, California. rrockne@coh.org ykuo@coh.org.', 'Department of Diabetes Complications & Metabolism, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope Medical Center, Duarte, California.', 'Department of Hematological Malignancies Translational Science, Hematology & Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation and the Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope Medical Center, Duarte, California.', 'Department of Diabetes Complications & Metabolism, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope Medical Center, Duarte, California.', 'Department of Population Sciences, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope Medical Center, Duarte, California.', 'Center for Gene Therapy, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope Medical Center, Duarte, California.', 'Department of Hematological Malignancies Translational Science, Hematology & Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation and the Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope Medical Center, Duarte, California.', 'Department of Hematological Malignancies Translational Science, Hematology & Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation and the Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope Medical Center, Duarte, California.', 'Department of Hematological Malignancies Translational Science, Hematology & Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation and the Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope Medical Center, Duarte, California.', 'Department of Hematological Malignancies Translational Science, Hematology & Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation and the Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope Medical Center, Duarte, California.', 'Department of Hematological Malignancies Translational Science, Hematology & Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation and the Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope Medical Center, Duarte, California.', 'Department of Hematological Malignancies Translational Science, Hematology & Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation and the Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope Medical Center, Duarte, California.', 'Division of Mathematical Oncology, Department of Computational and Quantitative Medicine, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope Medical Center, Duarte, California.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine;

Protection of telomeres 1 (POT1) mutations are observed in angiosarcoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, but their frequency in other solid tumors, including NSCLC subtypes, has not been rigorously explored. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed next-generation sequencing data from 62,368 tumors, including 11,134 NSCLCs and 100 PSCs. We performed logistic regression to identify associations between POT1 mutation frequency and tumor histology across 184 tumor categories, adjusting for tumor mutational burden. We further explored co-occurring gene mutations in genes previously reported to underlie PSC tumorigenesis. RESULTS: Across 184 tumor categories, POT1 mutations were most frequent in PSC and were 14 times more common in PSC (28%) than in other tumor types (P = 1.23 x 10(-31)) and 6.7 times more common in PSC than other NSCLCs (P = 5.1 x 10(-17)). PSCs harboring KRAS mutations were significantly more likely to harbor POT1 mutations (P = 1.3 x 10(-3)), whereas those with TP53 mutations were less likely to harbor POT1 mutations (P = .037). One-fourth of POT1-mutated PSCs harbored a second POT1 mutation. Across all PSCs, 83% of POT1 mutations were in the OB1/OB2 (DNA-binding) domain (P = 1.5 x 10(-5)), an enrichment not observed in other tumor types. CONCLUSION: We report an unanticipated association between POT1 mutation and PSC. Unlike other molecular alterations that are frequent across NSCLC subtypes, POT1 mutations are largely unique to PSC. This finding may help to develop disease-defining molecular subgroups within PSC and presents opportunities for molecularly stratified prognostication and therapy.","['Shen, Erica', 'Xiu, Joanne', 'Bentley, Rex', 'Lopez, Giselle Y', 'Walsh, Kyle M']","['Shen E', 'Xiu J', 'Bentley R', 'Lopez GY', 'Walsh KM']","['Department of Neurosurgery, Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, NC.', 'Caris Life Sciences, Inc, Phoenix, AZ.', 'Department of Pathology, Duke School of Medicine, Durham, NC; Duke Cancer Institute, Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, NC.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, NC; Department of Pathology, Duke School of Medicine, Durham, NC; Duke Cancer Institute, Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, NC.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, NC; Department of Pathology, Duke School of Medicine, Durham, NC; Duke Cancer Institute, Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, NC.

Sjogren's syndrome (SS), which involves exocrine dysfunction and the appearance of autoantibodies, shows salivary gland- and lacrimal gland-oriented clinical features. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is the most investigated pathogen as a candidate that directly induces the phenotype found in SS. The reactivation of the virus with various stimuli induced a dysregulated form of EBV that has the potential to infect SS-specific B cells and plasma cells that are closely associated with the function of an ectopic lymphoid structure that contains a germinal center (GC) in the salivary glands of individuals with SS. The involvement of human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) in SS has been epidemiologically established, but the disease concept of HTLV-1-associated SS remains unexplained due to limited evidence from basic research. Unlike the cell-to-cell contact between lymphocytes, biofilm-like structures are candidates as the mode of HTLV-1 infection of salivary gland epithelial cells (SGECs). HTLV-1 can infect SGECs with enhanced levels of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines that are secreted from SGECs. Regardless of the different targets that viruses have with respect to affinitive lymphocytes, viruses are involved in the formation of pathological alterations with immunological modifications in SS.","['Nakamura, Hideki', 'Shimizu, Toshimasa', 'Kawakami, Atsushi']","['Nakamura H', 'Shimizu T', 'Kawakami A']","['Department of Immunology and Rheumatology, Unit of Advanced Preventive Medical Sciences, Division of Advanced Preventive Medical Sciences, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki 852-8501, Japan.', 'Department of Immunology and Rheumatology, Unit of Advanced Preventive Medical Sciences, Division of Advanced Preventive Medical Sciences, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki 852-8501, Japan.', 'Department of Immunology and Rheumatology, Unit of Advanced Preventive Medical Sciences, Division of Advanced Preventive Medical Sciences, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki 852-8501, Japan.']",['eng'],['JP19K08884/Japan Society for the Promotion of Science'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200513,Switzerland,J Clin Med,Journal of clinical medicine,101606588,,,,PMC7290771,['NOTNLM'],"['Epstein-Barr virus', 'HTLV-1', 'salivary gland epithelial cell', 'viral infection']",2020/05/18 06:00,2020/05/18 06:01,['2020/05/17 06:00'],"['2020/04/15 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/06 00:00 [revised]', '2020/05/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/05/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/18 06:01 [medline]']","['jcm9051459 [pii]', '10.3390/jcm9051459 [doi]']",epublish,J Clin Med. 2020 May 13;9(5). pii: jcm9051459. doi: 10.3390/jcm9051459.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Response monitoring is performed by non-quantitative NESTED PCR, useless for evaluating patients' molecular remission, excluding them from treatment-free-remission protocols. Droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) is highly sensitive technology, allowing an absolute quantification independent of standard curves. Based on this, we have developed assays able to evaluate the molecular response in atypical patients. We designed new ddPCR-based molecular assays able to quantify atypical BCR-ABL1 transcripts, with a detection limit of 0.001%, validated in a cohort of 65 RNA from 11 patients. Fifty samples were identified congruently by ddPCR and NESTED PCR (40 positives and 10 negatives for atypical BCR-ABL1 transcript), while 11 positive samples were detected only by ddPCR. Our results highlight ddPCR usefulness, primarily when the BCR-ABL1/ABL1 level is less than 1.5% and NESTED PCR results are often inaccurate. Furthermore, we identified 3 patients who maintained a deep molecular response for at least one year, who could be considered good candidates for treatment-free remission approaches. Here, we describe a new promising molecular approach, highly sensitive, to monitor atypical BCR-ABL1 patients, paving the foundation to include them in treatment-free remission protocols.","['Petiti, Jessica', 'Lo Iacono, Marco', 'Dragani, Matteo', 'Pironi, Lucrezia', 'Fantino, Cristina', 'Rapanotti, Maria Cristina', 'Quarantelli, Fabrizio', 'Izzo, Barbara', 'Divona, Mariadomenica', 'Rege-Cambrin, Giovanna', 'Saglio, Giuseppe', 'Gottardi, Enrico Marco', 'Cilloni, Daniela', 'Fava, Carmen']","['Petiti J', 'Lo Iacono M', 'Dragani M', 'Pironi L', 'Fantino C', 'Rapanotti MC', 'Quarantelli F', 'Izzo B', 'Divona M', 'Rege-Cambrin G', 'Saglio G', 'Gottardi EM', 'Cilloni D', 'Fava C']","['Department of Clinical and Biological Sciences, University of Turin, 10043 Turin, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical and Biological Sciences, University of Turin, 10043 Turin, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical and Biological Sciences, University of Turin, 10043 Turin, Italy.', 'Division of Internal Medicine and Hematology, San Luigi Gonzaga Hospital, Orbassano, 10043 Turin, Italy.', 'Division of Internal Medicine and Hematology, San Luigi Gonzaga Hospital, Orbassano, 10043 Turin, Italy.', 'Department of Oncohematology, Polyclinic of Tor Vergata, 00133 Rome, Italy.', 'Ceinge Advanced Biotechnologies Center, 80131 Naples, Italy.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine and Biotechnology, University Federico II & Ceinge Advanced Biotechnologies Center, 80138 Naples, Italy.', 'Department of Oncohematology, Polyclinic of Tor Vergata, 00133 Rome, Italy.', 'Division of Internal Medicine and Hematology, San Luigi Gonzaga Hospital, Orbassano, 10043 Turin, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical and Biological Sciences, University of Turin, 10043 Turin, Italy.', 'Division of Internal Medicine and Hematology, San Luigi Gonzaga Hospital, Orbassano, 10043 Turin, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical and Biological Sciences, University of Turin, 10043 Turin, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical and Biological Sciences, University of Turin, 10043 Turin, Italy.']",['eng'],['10005/Associazione Italiana per la Ricerca sul Cancro'],['Journal Article'],20200513,Switzerland,J Clin Med,Journal of clinical medicine,101606588,,,,PMC7290999,['NOTNLM'],"['BCR-ABL1', 'MRD monitoring', 'atypical transcripts', 'chronic myeloid leukemia', 'digital PCR', 'treatment-free remission']",2020/05/18 06:00,2020/05/18 06:01,['2020/05/17 06:00'],"['2020/04/23 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/07 00:00 [revised]', '2020/05/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/05/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/18 06:01 [medline]']","['jcm9051457 [pii]', '10.3390/jcm9051457 [doi]']",epublish,J Clin Med. 2020 May 13;9(5). pii: jcm9051457. doi: 10.3390/jcm9051457.,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-8640-2462', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1046-3514', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6346-4791']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, their electrocardiography (ECG) features were analyzed. METHODS: Electronic health records of patients with a diagnosis of DLBCL and treated with AbC were reviewed retrospectively. Variables from ECGs obtained around anthracycline treatment were manually measured. RESULTS: A total of 76 patients (57% males). The incidence of abnormal ECG increased from 36.8% at baseline to 48.7%, of which only the prevalence of fragmented QRS (fQRS) significantly increased after AbC (15.8% to 28.9%, P = 0.041). In comparison with baseline ECG parameters, corrected QT interval (QTc) statistically prolonged (399.95 +/- 27.11 ms to 415.07 +/- 31.03 ms, P < 0.001), whilst QT dispersion (QTd) significantly (41.25 +/- 16.15 ms to 36.70 +/- 11.84 ms, P = 0.032) decreased. CONCLUSION: In DLBCL patients receiving anthracycline-based therapies, the main ECG abnormalities detected were fQRS and QTc prolongation.

CC-fused heterocycles were constructed using 4-hydroxycarbazole as the starting material, and further modification of these heterocycles yielded two CC derivatives. CC-7 with an additional - COOH group and CC-8 with the triphenylphosphonium (TPP) group, a mitochondria-targeting ligand introduced in the carbazole ring, dissolved in polar solvents and exhibited emission bands at 360 and 450 nm, respectively. The results indicate that visible light of 405 nm triggers the photolysis of the CC-drug conjugate and efficiently delivers the drug in both in vitro cancer cell models. Cytotoxicity evaluation indicates the suppression of proliferation of both types of cells treated with CC-8 under synergy effect combining drug potency and photosensitization. Further, the lower IC50 of CC-8 toward leukemia cells suggests the efficacy of the TPP ligand in increasing the bioavailability of CC-drug conjugates in leukemia treatment. Studies on mitochondria-targeting drug delivery systems are required for improving the performance of anticancer drugs.","['Wang, Bing-Yen', 'Lin, Yen-Cheng', 'Lai, Yi-Ting', 'Ou, Jia-Yu', 'Chang, Wen-Wei', 'Chu, Chih-Chien']","['Wang BY', 'Lin YC', 'Lai YT', 'Ou JY', 'Chang WW', 'Chu CC']","['Division of Thoracic Surgery, Department of Surgery, Changhua Christian Hospital, Changhua, Taiwan; School of Medicine, Chung Shan Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan; School of Medicine, College of Medicine, Kaohsiung Medical University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan; Institute of Genomics and Bioinformatics, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung, Taiwan; Ph.D. Program in Translational Medicine, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung, Taiwan; Center for General Education, Ming Dao University, Changhua, Taiwan.', 'Department of Medical Applied Chemistry, Chung Shan Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan.', 'Department of Biomedical Science, Chung Shan Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan.', 'Department of Medical Applied Chemistry, Chung Shan Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan.', 'Department of Biomedical Science, Chung Shan Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan.', 'Department of Medical Applied Chemistry, Chung Shan Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan; Department of Medical Education, Chung Shan Medical University Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan.

From transcriptome profiling, we show integrin-linked kinase (ILK), a key constituent of focal adhesions, is highly expressed in TKI-nonresponsive patient cells and their LSCs. Genetic and pharmacological inhibition of ILK impaired the survival of nonresponder patient cells, sensitizing them to TKIs, even in the presence of protective niche cells. Furthermore, ILK inhibition eliminated TKI-refractory LSCs from patients, but not normal HSCs, in vitro and in vivo. RNA-sequencing and functional validation studies implicated an important role of ILK in maintaining a requisite level of mitochondrial oxidative metabolism in highly purified, quiescent LSCs. Thus, these findings point to ILK as a critical survival mediator to TKIs and quiescent stem cells, offering an attractive therapeutic target and model for curative combination therapies in stem-cell-driven cancers.","['Rothe, Katharina', 'Babaian, Artem', 'Nakamichi, Naoto', 'Chen, Min', 'Chafe, Shawn C', 'Watanabe, Akie', 'Forrest, Donna L', 'Mager, Dixie L', 'Eaves, Connie J', 'Dedhar, Shoukat', 'Jiang, Xiaoyan']","['Rothe K', 'Babaian A', 'Nakamichi N', 'Chen M', 'Chafe SC', 'Watanabe A', 'Forrest DL', 'Mager DL', 'Eaves CJ', 'Dedhar S', 'Jiang X']","['Terry Fox Laboratory, BC Cancer, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1L3, Canada; Department of Medical Genetics, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z3, Canada.

Significantly improved survival necessitates an understanding of the morbidity burden borne by the growing survivor population. METHODS: The authors evaluated severe and/or life-threatening chronic health conditions (CHCs) and subsequent neoplasms (SNs) in patients with MM who were treated with aBMT using the Bone Marrow Transplant Survivor Study. A total of 630 study participants had undergone aBMT for MM at 1 of 3 BMT centers, had survived >/=2 years after aBMT, and were aged >/=18 years at the time of survey completion. Survivors of aBMT identified 289 nearest-age siblings to constitute an unaffected comparison group. Scoring of CHCs was based on version 5 of the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events to determine severity (with grade 3 indicating serious and grade 4 indicating life-threatening). RESULTS: The 10-year cumulative incidence of any grade 3 to 4 CHC among survivors of aBMT was 57.6 +/- 3.2%. Survivors of MM were found to be at 40% higher odds of developing grade 3 to 4 CHCs when compared with siblings (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.0-1.9). Among SNs, 96% were solid tumors, yielding a 10-year cumulative incidence of 13.6% +/- 2.5%. Pre-aBMT exposure to cyclophosphamide (hazard ratio [HR], 3.5; 95% CI, 1.5-8.1) and immunomodulatory drugs (HR, 3.9; 95% CI, 1.5-10.1) were associated with an increased risk of solid tumors. Melanoma (10-year cumulative incidence: 3.3% +/- 1.2%) and squamous cell carcinoma (10-year cumulative incidence: 5.1% +/- 1.8%), were the most common SNs. Pre-aBMT exposure to cyclophosphamide (HR, 6.02; 95% CI, 1.4-26.1) and immunomodulatory drugs (HR, 7.9; 95% CI, 0.9-68.5) was associated with an increased risk of melanoma. CONCLUSIONS: The 10-year cumulative incidence of severe and/or life-threatening CHCs was found to approach 60% in long-term survivors of MM, with solid SNs constituting a large morbidity burden. The current study has provided evidence supporting the close monitoring of survivors to manage morbidity.","['Arora, Mukta', 'Chen, Yanjun', 'Hageman, Lindsey', 'Wu, Jessica', 'Landier, Wendy', 'Francisco, Liton', 'Kung, Michelle', 'Ness, Emily', 'Bosworth, Alysia', 'Pamukcuoglu, Merve', 'Weisdorf, Daniel J', 'Forman, Stephen J', 'Armenian, Saro H', 'Bhatia, Smita']","['Arora M', 'Chen Y', 'Hageman L', 'Wu J', 'Landier W', 'Francisco L', 'Kung M', 'Ness E', 'Bosworth A', 'Pamukcuoglu M', 'Weisdorf DJ', 'Forman SJ', 'Armenian SH', 'Bhatia S']","['Division of Hematology, Oncology and Transplantation, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA.', 'Institute for Cancer Outcomes and Survivorship, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama, USA.', 'Institute for Cancer Outcomes and Survivorship, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama, USA.', 'Institute for Cancer Outcomes and Survivorship, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama, USA.', 'Institute for Cancer Outcomes and Survivorship, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama, USA.', 'Institute for Cancer Outcomes and Survivorship, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama, USA.', 'Institute for Cancer Outcomes and Survivorship, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama, USA.', 'Institute for Cancer Outcomes and Survivorship, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama, USA.', 'Department of Population Sciences, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, California, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Oncology and Transplantation, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Oncology and Transplantation, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA.', 'Department of Population Sciences, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, California, USA.', 'Department of Population Sciences, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, California, USA.', 'Institute for Cancer Outcomes and Survivorship, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA078938/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R6502-16 (SB)/Leukemia and Lymphoma Society']","['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200515,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Alabama/epidemiology', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*methods', '*Cancer Survivors', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/chemically induced/*epidemiology', 'Chronic Disease/epidemiology', 'Cyclophosphamide/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Graft Rejection/drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/adverse effects', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Melanoma/chemically induced/*epidemiology', 'Middle Aged', 'Minnesota/epidemiology', 'Morbidity', 'Multiple Myeloma/*epidemiology/*therapy', 'Risk Factors', 'Siblings', 'Skin Neoplasms/chemically induced/*epidemiology', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*autografts', '*hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', '*long-term survivors', '*multiple myeloma', '*second neoplasms']",2020/05/16 06:00,2021/05/21 06:00,['2020/05/16 06:00'],"['2020/01/18 00:00 [received]', '2020/04/02 00:00 [revised]', '2020/04/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/21 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/16 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.32941 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2020 Jul 15;126(14):3322-3329. doi: 10.1002/cncr.32941.

Methods: All cases of cancer diagnosed in 15-24 years, recorded by all French population-based registries (18% of the French population), over the 2000-2016 period, were included. Age-standardized incidence rates, conventional annual percentage change (cAPC) of incidence over time, and 5-year overall survival (5yOS) were calculated. Results: We analyzed 2734 cancer diagnoses in adolescents and 4199 in young adults. Overall incidence rates were 231.9/10(6) in 15-19 year olds and 354.0/10(6) in 20-24 year olds. The most frequently diagnosed cancers in male AYA were malignant gonadal germ-cell tumors (GCT), Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), and malignant melanoma and were HL, thyroid carcinoma, and malignant melanoma in females. Cancer incidence was stable over time with a cAPC of 0.8% (p = 0.72). For all cancers combined, 5yOS was 86.6% (95% CI: 85.8-87.4), >85% for HL, non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL), GCT, thyroid carcinomas, and malignant melanomas, and around 60% and lower for osteosarcomas, Ewing tumors, hepatic carcinomas, and rhabdomyosarcomas. The 5yOS has significantly improved from 2000-2007 to 2008-2015 for all cancers pooled, with a substantial gain of 4% for 15-19 year olds and 3% for 20-24 year olds. Conclusion: Notwithstanding the encouraging results for some cancers, and overall, persistent poorer survivals in AYA were shown compared to children for acute lymphoblastic leukemia, osteosarcoma, Ewing tumor, rhabdomyosarcoma, and malignant hepatic tumors. These disparities require further investigation to identify and address the causes of these inferior outcomes.","['Raze, Thomas', 'Lacour, Brigitte', 'Cowppli-Bony, Anne', 'Delafosse, Patricia', 'Velten, Michel', 'Tretarre, Brigitte', 'Defossez, Gautier', 'Hammas, Karima', 'Woronoff, Anne-Sophie', 'Ganry, Olivier', 'Plouvier, Sandrine', 'Coureau, Gaelle', 'Guizard, Anne-Valerie', 'Bara, Simona', 'Monnereau, Alain', 'Daubisse-Marliac, Laetitia', 'Troussard, Xavier', ""D'Almeida, Tania"", 'Baldi, Isabelle', 'Bouvier, Veronique', 'Boissel, Nicolas', 'Clavel, Jacqueline', 'Desandes, Emmanuel']","['Raze T', 'Lacour B', 'Cowppli-Bony A', 'Delafosse P', 'Velten M', 'Tretarre B', 'Defossez G', 'Hammas K', 'Woronoff AS', 'Ganry O', 'Plouvier S', 'Coureau G', 'Guizard AV', 'Bara S', 'Monnereau A', 'Daubisse-Marliac L', 'Troussard X', ""D'Almeida T"", 'Baldi I', 'Bouvier V', 'Boissel N', 'Clavel J', 'Desandes E']","[""Registre National des Cancers de l'Enfant, Registre National des Tumeurs Solides de l'Enfant, CHRU Nancy, Vandoeuvre-les-Nancy, France."", ""Registre National des Cancers de l'Enfant, Registre National des Tumeurs Solides de l'Enfant, CHRU Nancy, Vandoeuvre-les-Nancy, France."", 'Centre de Recherche en Epidemiologie et en Statistique Sorbonne-Paris Cite (CRESS), UMR 1153, INSERM, Universite Paris-Descartes, Paris, France.', 'Registre des Tumeurs de Loire-Atlantique et Vendee, CHU de Nantes, SIRIC-ILIAD, Nantes, France.', ""Registre General des Cancers de l'Isere, Meylan, France."", ""Registre des Cancers du Bas-Rhin, Laboratoire d'epidemiologie et de Sante Publique, Inserm UMR-S1113/Centre Paul Strauss, Service de Sante Publique, Universite de Strasbourg, Strasbourg, France."", ""Registre des Tumeurs de l'Herault, Montpellier, France."", 'Registre des Cancers de Poitou-Charentes, CHU Poitiers, Poitiers, France.', 'Registre des Cancers du Haut-Rhin, ARER68, Groupe Hospitalier de la Region de Mulhouse et Sud-Alsace (GHRMSA), Mulhouse, France.', 'Registre des Tumeurs du Doubs, EA3181, CHRU Besancon, Besancon, France.', 'Registre General du Cancer de la Somme, CHU Amiens, Amiens, France.', 'Registre General des Cancers de Lille et de sa Region, GCS-C2RC, Lille, France.', ""Epicene, Centre Inserm U1219/CHU de Bordeaux, Service d'information Medicale, Universite Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France."", 'Registre General des Tumeurs du Calvados, Caen, France.', 'Registre des Cancers de la Manche, Cherbourg-Octeville, France.', 'Institut Bergonie, Registre des Hemopathies Malignes de la Gironde/Universite de Bordeaux, Inserm U1219, equipe EPICENE, ISPED, Bordeaux, France.', 'Institut Claudius Regaud, IUCT-O, Registre des Cancers du Tarn, CHU Toulouse/UMR 1027 Universite de Toulouse, UPS, Inserm, Toulouse, France.', 'Registre des Hemopathies Malignes de Basse Normandie, Caen, France.', 'Registre General des Cancers en Region Limousin, CHU de Limoges, Limoges, France.', 'Equipe EPICENE, INSERM U1219, Universite de Bordeaux/Service Sante Travail Environnement, CHU Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France.', 'Registre des Tumeurs Digestives du Calvados, Caen, France.', ""Unite d'Hematologie Adolescents et Jeunes Adultes, Hopital Saint-Louis, Assistance Publique des Hopitaux de Paris/EA-3518, Institut de Recherche Saint-Louis, Universite de Paris, Paris, France."", 'Centre de Recherche en Epidemiologie et en Statistique Sorbonne-Paris Cite (CRESS), UMR 1153, INSERM, Universite Paris-Descartes, Paris, France.', ""Registre National des Hemopathies Malignes de l'Enfant, Villejuif, France."", ""Registre National des Cancers de l'Enfant, Registre National des Tumeurs Solides de l'Enfant, CHRU Nancy, Vandoeuvre-les-Nancy, France."", 'Centre de Recherche en Epidemiologie et en Statistique Sorbonne-Paris Cite (CRESS), UMR 1153, INSERM, Universite Paris-Descartes, Paris, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200515,United States,J Adolesc Young Adult Oncol,Journal of adolescent and young adult oncology,101543508,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Female', 'France/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Lymphoma/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Melanoma', '*Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Neoplasms, Germ Cell and Embryonal/epidemiology', 'Registries', 'Survival Rate', 'Young Adult']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*adolescents', '*cancer', '*incidence', '*survival', '*trends', '*young adults']",2020/05/16 06:00,2021/10/26 06:00,['2020/05/16 06:00'],"['2020/05/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/26 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/16 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/jayao.2020.0017 [doi]'],ppublish,J Adolesc Young Adult Oncol. 2021 Feb;10(1):29-45. doi: 10.1089/jayao.2020.0017.

However, these analyses of The Cancer Genome Atlas data set revealed downregulation of TP73-AS1 in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In this study, we aimed to study the molecular mechanism between TP73-AS1 and cell proliferation in AML. Methods: Bone marrow (BM) samples were obtained from 50 AML patients and 50 healthy controls. Cell transient transfections were performed to analyze gene interactions. Dual-luciferase reporter assay, quantitative polymerase chain reaction and Western blot were used to study the gene expressions. Cell proliferation was analyzed by CCK-8 method. Results: TP73-AS1 was confirmed to be downregulated in AML. TP73-AS1 was predicted to interact with miR-21, while overexpression of TP73-AS1 and miR-21 did not affect the expression of each other. Instead, overexpression of TP73-AS1 led to the upregulation of phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN), a downstream target of miR-21. Cell proliferation analysis showed that overexpression of TP73-AS1 and PTEN led to a decreased proliferation rate of AML cells. Overexpression of miR-21 played an opposite role and reduced the effects of overexpressing TP73-AS1 and PTEN. Conclusion: TP73-AS1 may regulate the miR-21/PTEN axis to affect cell proliferation in AML.","['Yuan, Zhongtao', 'Li, Luqiong', 'Zheng, Mai', 'Xu, Jian', 'Wang, Wei']","['Yuan Z', 'Li L', 'Zheng M', 'Xu J', 'Wang W']","[""Department of Hematology, The 920 Hospital of People's Liberation Army, Kunming, Yunnan, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Rheumatology and Immunology, First Affiliated Hospital of Kunming Medical University, Kunming, Yunnan, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Rheumatology and Immunology, First Affiliated Hospital of Kunming Medical University, Kunming, Yunnan, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Rheumatology and Immunology, First Affiliated Hospital of Kunming Medical University, Kunming, Yunnan, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Rheumatology and Immunology, First Affiliated Hospital of Kunming Medical University, Kunming, Yunnan, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Observational Study']",20200515,United States,Cancer Biother Radiopharm,Cancer biotherapy & radiopharmaceuticals,9605408,"['0 (MIRN21 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)', '0 (long non-coding RNA KIAA0495, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN Phosphohydrolase)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN protein, human)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Biopsy', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/genetics', 'Down-Regulation', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/*metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'PTEN Phosphohydrolase/*genetics', 'RNA, Long Noncoding/*metabolism', 'Up-Regulation']",,['NOTNLM'],"['PTEN', 'TP73-AS1', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'miR-21', 'proliferation']",2020/05/16 06:00,2021/12/15 06:00,['2020/05/16 06:00'],"['2020/05/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/15 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/16 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/cbr.2019.3142 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Biother Radiopharm. 2021 Apr;36(3):268-272. doi: 10.1089/cbr.2019.3142.

Patient-centered innovations are needed. We focused on patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), a chronic disease with a generally good long-term prognosis because of the advent of tyrosine kinase inhibitors. However, both medication adherence by patients and guideline adherence by physicians are suboptimal, unnecessarily jeopardizing treatment outcomes. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to develop a patient-centered innovation for patients with CML using a design thinking methodology. METHODS: The 5 phases of design thinking (ie, empathize, define, ideate, prototype, and test) were completed, and each phase started with the patient. Stakeholders and end users were identified and interviewed, and observations in the care system were made. Using tools in human-centered design, problems were defined and various prototypes of solutions were generated. These were evaluated by patients and stakeholders and then further refined. RESULTS: The patients desired (1) insights into their own disease; (2) insights into the symptoms experienced, both in terms of knowledge and comprehension; and (3) improvements in the organization of care delivery. A web-based platform, CMyLife, was developed and pilot-tested. It has multiple features, all targeting parts of the bigger solution, including a website with reliable information and a forum, a guideline app, personal medical records with logs of symptoms and laboratory results (including a molecular marker and linked to the guideline app), tailored feedback based on the patients' symptoms and/or results, screen-to-screen consulting, delivery of medication, and the collection of blood samples at home. CONCLUSIONS: The multifeatured innovation, CMyLife, was developed in a multidisciplinary way and with active patient participation. The aim of developing CMyLife was to give patients the tools to monitor their results, interpret these results, and act on them. With this tool, they are provided with the know-how to consider their results in relation to their personal care process. Whether CMyLife achieves its goal and the evaluation of the added value will be the focus of future studies. CML could become the first malignancy for which patients are able to monitor and manage their disease by themselves.","['Ector, Genevieve Icg', 'Westerweel, Peter E', 'Hermens, Rosella Pmg', 'Braspenning, Karin Ae', 'Heeren, Barend Cm', 'Vinck, Oscar Mf', 'de Jong, Jan Jm', 'Janssen, Jeroen Jwm', 'Blijlevens, Nicole Ma']","['Ector GI', 'Westerweel PE', 'Hermens RP', 'Braspenning KA', 'Heeren BC', 'Vinck OM', 'de Jong JJ', 'Janssen JJ', 'Blijlevens NM']","['Department of Hematology, Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen, Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Albert Schweitzer Hospital, Dordrecht, Netherlands.', 'Department of IQ Healthcare, Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen, Netherlands.', 'Department of IQ Healthcare, Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen, Netherlands.', 'REshape Innovation Center, Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen, Netherlands.', ""Dutch Patient Advocacy Group 'Hematon', Utrecht, Netherlands."", 'Department of Hematology, Cancer Center Amsterdam, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Amsterdam University Medical Centers, Amsterdam, Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen, Netherlands.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200515,Canada,J Med Internet Res,Journal of medical Internet research,100959882,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', '*Disease Management', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Patient-Centered Care/*methods', 'Telemedicine/*methods', 'Treatment Outcome']",PMC7260663,['NOTNLM'],"['*chronic myeloid leukemia', '*eHealth', '*mobile apps', '*patient participation']",2020/05/16 06:00,2020/11/18 06:00,['2020/05/16 06:00'],"['2019/08/16 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/11 00:00 [revised]', '2020/05/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/05/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/18 06:00 [medline]']","['v22i5e15895 [pii]', '10.2196/15895 [doi]']",epublish,J Med Internet Res. 2020 May 15;22(5):e15895. doi: 10.2196/15895.,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-1558-944X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0746-7039', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7624-7120', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2130-2863', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7773-7412', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6600-0511', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6986-0725', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9567-1955', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1801-2072']",,"['(c)Genevieve ICG Ector, Peter E Westerweel, Rosella PMG Hermens, Karin AE', 'Braspenning, Barend CM Heeren, Oscar MF Vinck, Jan JM de Jong, Jeroen JWM', 'Janssen, Nicole MA Blijlevens.

Here, we describe a set of resources to streamline reporter gene knock-ins in zebrafish and demonstrate the broader utility of the method in mammalian cells. Our approach uses short homology of 24-48 bp to drive targeted integration of DNA reporter cassettes by homology-mediated end joining (HMEJ) at high frequency at a double strand break in the targeted gene. Our vector series, pGTag (plasmids for Gene Tagging), contains reporters flanked by a universal CRISPR sgRNA sequence which enables in vivo liberation of the homology arms. We observed high rates of germline transmission (22-100%) for targeted knock-ins at eight zebrafish loci and efficient integration at safe harbor loci in porcine and human cells. Our system provides a straightforward and cost-effective approach for high efficiency gene targeting applications in CRISPR and TALEN compatible systems.","['Wierson, Wesley A', 'Welker, Jordan M',

We therefore examined the associations between modifiable illness perceptions and substantial fatigue while controlling for sociodemographic, clinical, and psychological factors (symptoms of depression and anxiety) among haematological cancer survivors.Methods: Data from the population-based PROFILES registry were used. Survivors diagnosed between 1999 and 2013 with Hodgkin lymphoma (N = 164), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (N = 655) and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (N = 174) were included. Survivors completed the Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire (B-IPQ), the Fatigue Assessment Scale (FAS), and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Multivariable logistic regressions analyses were performed for the total group and three haematological cancers separately relating illness perceptions to substantial fatigue (>21 FAS).Results: Haematological cancer survivors with illness perceptions that represent more negative consequences (consequences, OR = 1.27; 95%CI = 1.13-1.42); attribute more symptoms to their illness (identity, OR = 1.29; 95%CI = 1.17-1.43); and have a poorer illness understanding (coherence, 1.13; 1.04-1.22) were more often substantially fatigued. For the remaining five illness perceptions, no significant association was found. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma survivors who reported a poor illness understanding (coherence, OR = 1.35; 95% CI = 1.06-1.72) and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia survivors who reported that treatment can control (OR = 1.25; 95%CI = 1.01-1.55) the illness experienced more often substantial fatigue.Conclusion: Those who experience more consequences of their disease, attribute more symptoms to their illness, and have a poorer illness understanding, have a higher risk to experience substantial levels of fatigue even years after diagnosis. Psychological interventions changing these illness perceptions may be beneficial in reducing fatigue among haematological cancer survivors.","['Schoormans, Dounya', 'Jansen, Mandy', 'Mols, Floortje', 'Oerlemans, Simone']","['Schoormans D', 'Jansen M', 'Mols F', 'Oerlemans S']","['CoRPS - Center of Research on Psychological and Somatic disorders, Department of Medical and Clinical Psychology, Tilburg University, Tilburg, The Netherlands.', 'CoRPS - Center of Research on Psychological and Somatic disorders, Department of Medical and Clinical Psychology, Tilburg University, Tilburg, The Netherlands.', 'CoRPS - Center of Research on Psychological and Somatic disorders, Department of Medical and Clinical Psychology, Tilburg University, Tilburg, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Research, Netherlands Comprehensive Cancer Organisation (IKNL), Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Research, Netherlands Comprehensive Cancer Organisation (IKNL), Utrecht, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200515,England,Acta Oncol,"Acta oncologica (Stockholm, Sweden)",8709065,,IM,"['Adult', 'Anxiety/psychology', 'Cancer Survivors/*psychology', 'Depression/psychology', 'Fatigue/etiology/*psychology', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*psychology', 'Hodgkin Disease/psychology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/psychology', 'Logistic Models', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/psychology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Negativism', 'Perception', 'Symptom Assessment']",,,,2020/05/16 06:00,2021/06/01 06:00,['2020/05/16 06:00'],"['2020/05/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/01 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/16 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/0284186X.2020.1759823 [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Oncol. 2020 Aug;59(8):959-966. doi: 10.1080/0284186X.2020.1759823.

This varied by location, race and ethnicity, and insurance status. IQVIA consistently identified fewer cases who received an OAM of interest than SEER-Medicare. The difference was least pronounced for breast cancer agents and most pronounced for myeloma agents. The IQVIA pharmacy database included a large portion of persons in the SEER areas. Future studies should assess receipt of OAMs for other cancer sites and in different SEER registries.","['Tran, Quyen', 'Warren, Joan L', 'Barrett, Michael J', 'Annett, Dave', 'Marth, Melissa', 'Cress, Rosemary D', 'Deapen, Dennis', 'Glaser, Sally L', 'Gomez, Scarlett L', 'Schwartz, Stephen M', 'Li, Christopher I', 'Wu, Xiao-Cheng', 'Enewold, Lindsey', 'Harlan, Linda C', 'Rivera, Donna R', 'Winn, Deborah M', 'Penberthy, Lynne', 'Cronin, Kathleen A']","['Tran Q', 'Warren JL', 'Barrett MJ', 'Annett D', 'Marth M', 'Cress RD', 'Deapen D', 'Glaser SL', 'Gomez SL', 'Schwartz SM', 'Li CI', 'Wu XC', 'Enewold L', 'Harlan LC', 'Rivera DR', 'Winn DM', 'Penberthy L', 'Cronin KA']","['Food and Drug Administration, Silver Spring, MD.', 'National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD.', 'Information Mangement Services, Inc., Calverton, MD.', 'Information Mangement Services, Inc., Calverton, MD.', 'IQVIA, Rockledge, PA.', 'Cancer Registry of Greater California, Sacramento, CA.', 'University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA.', 'University of California San Francisco, Fremont, CA.', 'University of California San Francisco, Fremont, CA.', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA.', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA.', 'Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center, New Orleans, LA.', 'National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD.', 'National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD.', 'National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD.', 'National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD.', 'National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD.', 'National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,J Natl Cancer Inst Monogr,Journal of the National Cancer Institute.

Although the mechanism of MYC regulation is still not fully understood, learning about the comprehensive mechanism controlling the transcriptional activity of MYC will lead to therapeutic targets. The CRISPR/Cas9 library system is a simple and powerful screening technique. This study aims to identify new transcriptional upstream activators of MYC using the CRISPR activation library with new promoter-reporter systems. Methods and Results: The MYC promoter-reporter system was developed with a photoconvertible fluorescent protein, Dendra2, and named ""pMYC-promoter-Dendra2."" This MYC promoter-reporter system was designed to harbor a proximal MYC promoter at (3.1 kb). Both the CRISPR activation library and pMYC-promoter-Dendra2 were induced to HEK 293T cells, and Dendra2-positive cells, that are supposed that MYC should be upregulated, were collected individually by a cell sorter. Among the 169 cells collected, 12 clones were successfully established. Then, pMYC-promoter-Dendra2 was transfected again into these 12 clones, and two of 12 clones showed Dendra2 positivity. In this procedure, the cells with non-specific autofluorescence were correctly distinguished by utilizing the photoswitchable character of Dendra2. Using extracted genomic DNA of these two Dendra2 positive clones, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed to amplify the guide RNA (gRNA) containing region, which was introduced by the CRISPR activation library. Eventually, PLEKHO2, MICU, MBTPS1, and M1AP were identified, and these gRNAs were transfected individually into HEK 293T cells again using the CRISPR activation system. Only M1AP gRNA transfected cells showed Dendra2-positive fluorescence. Then, the overexpression vector for M1AP with a doxycycline-inducible vector confirmed that M1AP induced high MYC expression by real-time quantitative PCR and western blot. Furthermore, the dual-luciferase assay showed a significant increase of promoter activity, and MYC mRNA was higher in M1AP- overexpressing cells. M1AP is highly expressed in several cancers, though, a positive correlation between M1AP and MYC was observed only in human acute myeloid leukemia. Conclusion: The present study confirmed that the experimental method using the CRISPR library technology functions effectively for the identification of molecules that activate endogenous MYC. This method will help elucidate the regulatory mechanism of MYC expression, as well as supporting further drug research against malignant tumors.","['Yamamoto, Akiko', 'Kurata, Morito', 'Onishi, Iichiroh', 'Sugita, Keisuke', 'Matsumura, Miwa', 'Ishibashi, Sachiko', 'Ikeda, Masumi', 'Yamamoto, Kouhei', 'Kitagawa, Masanobu']","['Yamamoto A', 'Kurata M', 'Onishi I', 'Sugita K', 'Matsumura M', 'Ishibashi S', 'Ikeda M', 'Yamamoto K', 'Kitagawa M']","['Department of Comprehensive Pathology, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Comprehensive Pathology, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Comprehensive Pathology, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Comprehensive Pathology, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Comprehensive Pathology, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Comprehensive Pathology, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Comprehensive Pathology, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Comprehensive Pathology, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Comprehensive Pathology, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200506,United States,PeerJ,PeerJ,101603425,,,,PMC7210806,['NOTNLM'],"['CRISPR library screening', 'MYC']",2020/05/16 06:00,2020/05/16 06:01,['2020/05/16 06:00'],"['2019/12/26 00:00 [received]', '2020/04/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/05/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/16 06:01 [medline]']","['10.7717/peerj.9046 [doi]', '9046 [pii]']",epublish,PeerJ. 2020 May 6;8:e9046. doi: 10.7717/peerj.9046. eCollection 2020.,,['The authors declare there are no competing interests.'],['(c)2020 Yamamoto et al.'],,,['figshare/10.6084/m9.figshare.11991639.v1'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the proposed work, we address the problem of whole-slide blood cell segmentation using the semantic segmentation approach. We design a novel convolutional encoder-decoder framework along with VGG-16 as the pixel-level feature extraction model. The proposed framework comprises 3 main steps: First, all the original images along with manually generated ground truth masks of each blood cell type are passed through the preprocessing stage. In the preprocessing stage, pixel-level labeling, RGB to grayscale conversion of masked image and pixel fusing, and unity mask generation are performed. After that, VGG16 is loaded into the system, which acts as a pretrained pixel-level feature extraction model. In the third step, the training process is initiated on the proposed model. We have evaluated our network performance on three evaluation metrics. We obtained outstanding results with respect to classwise, as well as global and mean accuracies. Our system achieved classwise accuracies of 97.45%, 93.34%, and 85.11% for RBCs, WBCs, and platelets, respectively, while global and mean accuracies remain 97.18% and 91.96%, respectively.","['Shahzad, Muhammad', 'Umar, Arif Iqbal', 'Khan, Muazzam A', 'Shirazi, Syed Hamad', 'Khan, Zakir', 'Yousaf, Waqas']","['Shahzad M', 'Umar AI', 'Khan MA', 'Shirazi SH', 'Khan Z', 'Yousaf W']","['Department of Information Technology, Hazara University Mansehra, Dhodial, Pakistan.', 'Department of Information Technology, Hazara University Mansehra, Dhodial, Pakistan.', 'Department of Computing (SEECS), National University of Sciences & Technology (NUST), Islamabad, Pakistan.', 'Department of Information Technology, Hazara University Mansehra, Dhodial, Pakistan.', 'Department of Information Technology, Hazara University Mansehra, Dhodial, Pakistan.', 'Department of Information Technology, Hazara University Mansehra, Dhodial, Pakistan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200121,United States,Comput Math Methods Med,Computational and mathematical methods in medicine,101277751,,IM,"['*Algorithms', 'Blood Cells/*classification/*ultrastructure', 'Blood Platelets/ultrastructure', 'Computational Biology', 'Databases, Factual/statistics & numerical data', 'Deep Learning', 'Erythrocytes/ultrastructure', 'Humans', 'Image Enhancement/methods', 'Image Processing, Computer-Assisted/*methods/statistics & numerical data', 'Leukocytes/ultrastructure', 'Neural Networks, Computer', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood', 'Semantics']",PMC7201460,,,2020/05/16 06:00,2021/04/20 06:00,['2020/05/16 06:00'],"['2019/04/30 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/05/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1155/2020/4015323 [doi]'],epublish,Comput Math Methods Med. 2020 Jan 21;2020:4015323. doi: 10.1155/2020/4015323. eCollection 2020.,['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9534-4719'],['The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.'],['Copyright (c) 2020 Muhammad Shahzad et al.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, immune cells are a highly heterogeneous population and can vary highly in clonal expansion, migration and function status, making it difficult to evaluate and predict patient response to immune therapy. Conventional technologies only yield information on the average population information of the treatment, masking the heterogeneity of the individual T cell activation status, the formation of immune synapse, as well as the efficacy of tumor cell killing at the single-cell level. To fully interrogate these single-cell events in detail, herein, we present a microfluidic microwell array device that enables the massive parallel analysis of the immunocyte's heterogeneity upon its interaction pairs with tumor cells at the single-cell level. By precisely controlling the number and ratio of tumor cells and T cells, our technique can interrogate the dynamics of the CD8+ T cell and leukemia cell interaction inside 6400 microfluidic wells simultaneously. We have demonstrated that by investigating the interactions of T cell and tumor cell pairs at the single-cell level using our microfluidic chip, details hidden in bulk investigations, such as heterogeneity in T cell killing capacity, time-dependent killing dynamics, as well as drug treatment-induced dynamic shifts, can be revealed. This method opens up avenues to investigate the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy and resistance at the single-cell level and can explore our understanding of fundamental cancer immunity as well as determine cancer immunotherapy efficacy for personalized therapy.","['Tu, Honglei', 'Wu, Zhuhao', 'Xia, Yu', 'Chen, Hui', 'Hu, Hang', 'Ding, Zhao', 'Zhou, Fuling', 'Guo, Shishang']","['Tu H', 'Wu Z', 'Xia Y', 'Chen H', 'Hu H', 'Ding Z', 'Zhou F', 'Guo S']","[""Department of Clinical Hematology, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei 430071, People's Republic of China. zhoufuling@whu.edu.cn."", 'Key Laboratory of Artificial Micro- and Nano-structures of Ministry of Education, School of Physics and Technology, Wuhan University, Wuhan 430072, China. gssyhx@whu.edu.cn.', 'Key Laboratory of Artificial Micro- and Nano-structures of Ministry of Education, School of Physics and Technology, Wuhan University, Wuhan 430072, China. gssyhx@whu.edu.cn.', 'Key Laboratory of Artificial Micro- and Nano-structures of Ministry of Education, School of Physics and Technology, Wuhan University, Wuhan 430072, China. gssyhx@whu.edu.cn.', ""Department of Colorectal and Anal Surgery, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei 430072, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Colorectal and Anal Surgery, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei 430072, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Clinical Hematology, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei 430071, People's Republic of China. zhoufuling@whu.edu.cn."", 'Key Laboratory of Artificial Micro- and Nano-structures of Ministry of Education, School of Physics and Technology, Wuhan University, Wuhan 430072, China. gssyhx@whu.edu.cn.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Video-Audio Media']",,England,Analyst,The Analyst,0372652,,IM,"['Animals', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Cell Communication/*immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Female', 'Lab-On-A-Chip Devices', 'Leukemia/*immunology/pathology', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Microfluidics/instrumentation/methods', 'Single-Cell Analysis']",,,,2020/05/16 06:00,2021/04/15 06:00,['2020/05/16 06:00'],"['2020/05/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/15 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/16 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1039/d0an00110d [doi]'],ppublish,Analyst. 2020 Jun 15;145(12):4138-4147. doi: 10.1039/d0an00110d.,"['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3313-9335', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7210-4704']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we report that among different cancer types, epigenetic factor TET1 is highly expressed in T-ALL and is crucial for human T-ALL cell growth in vivo. Knockout of TET1 in mice and knockdown in human T cell did not perturb normal T-cell proliferation, indicating that TET1 expression is dispensable for normal T-cell growth. The promotion of leukemic growth by TET1 was dependent on its catalytic property to maintain global 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) marks, thereby regulate cell cycle, DNA repair genes, and T-ALL associated oncogenes. Furthermore, overexpression of the Tet1-catalytic domain was sufficient to augment global 5hmC levels and leukemic growth of T-ALL cells in vivo. We demonstrate that PARP enzymes, which are highly expressed in T-ALL patients, participate in establishing H3K4me3 marks at the TET1 promoter and that PARP1 interacts with the TET1 protein. Importantly, the growth related role of TET1 in T-ALL could be antagonized by the clinically approved PARP inhibitor Olaparib, which abrogated TET1 expression, induced loss of 5hmC marks, and antagonized leukemic growth of T-ALL cells, opening a therapeutic avenue for this disease.","['Bamezai, Shiva', 'Demir, Deniz', 'Pulikkottil, Alex Jose', 'Ciccarone, Fabio', 'Fischbein, Elena', 'Sinha, Amit', 'Borga, Chiara', 'Te Kronnie, Geertruy', 'Meyer, Luder-Hinrich', 'Mohr, Fabian', 'Gotze, Maria', 'Caiafa, Paola', 'Debatin, Klaus-Michael', 'Dohner, Konstanze', 'Dohner, Hartmut', 'Gonzalez-Menendez, Irene', 'Quintanilla-Fend, Leticia', 'Herold, Tobias', 'Jeremias, Irmela', 'Feuring-Buske, Michaela', 'Buske, Christian', 'Rawat, Vijay P S']","['Bamezai S', 'Demir D', 'Pulikkottil AJ', 'Ciccarone F', 'Fischbein E', 'Sinha A', 'Borga C', 'Te Kronnie G', 'Meyer LH', 'Mohr F', 'Gotze M', 'Caiafa P', 'Debatin KM', 'Dohner K', 'Dohner H', 'Gonzalez-Menendez I', 'Quintanilla-Fend L', 'Herold T', 'Jeremias I', 'Feuring-Buske M', 'Buske C', 'Rawat VPS']","['Institute of Experimental Cancer Research, University Hospital of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Institute of Experimental Cancer Research, University Hospital of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Institute of Experimental Cancer Research, University Hospital of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Biology, University of Rome ""Tor Vergata"", Rome, Italy.', 'Institute of Experimental Cancer Research, University Hospital of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Basepair, New York, NY, USA.', ""Department of Women's and Children's Health, University of Padova, Padova, Italy."", ""Department of Women's and Children's Health, University of Padova, Padova, Italy."", 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Ulm University Medical Center, Ulm, Germany.', 'Institute of Experimental Cancer Research, University Hospital of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Institute of Experimental Cancer Research, University Hospital of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Ulm University Medical Center, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology, University of Tubingen, 72076, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology, University of Tubingen, 72076, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine III, University Hospital, LMU Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'Research Unit Apoptosis in Hematopoietic Stem Cells, Helmholtz Center Munich, German Center for Environmental Health (HMGU), Munich, Germany.', 'Research Unit Apoptosis in Hematopoietic Stem Cells, Helmholtz Center Munich, German Center for Environmental Health (HMGU), Munich, Germany.', ""Department of Pediatrics, Dr. von Hauner Children's Hospital, Ludwig Maximilians University, Munich, Germany."", 'German Consortium for Translational Cancer Research (DKTK), Partnering Site Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'Institute of Experimental Cancer Research, University Hospital of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Institute of Experimental Cancer Research, University Hospital of Ulm, Ulm, Germany. christian.buske@uni-ulm.de.', 'Institute of Experimental Cancer Research, University Hospital of Ulm, Ulm, Germany. vijay.rawat@uni-ulm.de.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200515,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Phthalazines)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (TET1 protein, mouse)', '0 (histone H3 trimethyl Lys4)', 'EC 1.- (Mixed Function Oxygenases)', 'EC 1.- (TET1 protein, human)', 'WOH1JD9AR8 (olaparib)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Proliferation', '*DNA Methylation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*physiology', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Histones', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, SCID', 'Mixed Function Oxygenases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Phthalazines/*pharmacology', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,,,2020/05/16 06:00,2021/02/26 06:00,['2020/05/16 06:00'],"['2020/01/14 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/04/28 00:00 [revised]', '2020/05/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/26 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/16 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-020-0864-3 [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-020-0864-3 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2021 Feb;35(2):389-403. doi: 10.1038/s41375-020-0864-3.

Patients with relapsed FLT3-mutated disease respond well to 2nd generation FLT3 TKIs but inevitably relapse within a short timeframe. In this setting, until overt relapse occurs, the bone marrow microenvironment facilitates leukemia cell survival despite continued on-target inhibition. We demonstrate that human bone marrow derived conditioned medium (CM) protects FLT3-ITD(+) AML cells from the 2nd generation FLT3 TKI quizartinib and activates STAT3 and STAT5 in leukemia cells. Extrinsic activation of STAT5 by CM is the primary mediator of leukemia cell resistance to FLT3 inhibition. Combination treatment with quizartinib and dasatinib abolishes STAT5 activation and significantly reduces the IC50 of quizartinib in FLT3-ITD(+) AML cells cultured in CM. We demonstrate that CM protects FLT3-ITD(+) AML cells from the inhibitory effects of quizartinib on glycolysis and that this is partially reversed by treating cells with the combination of quizartinib and dasatinib. Using a doxycycline-inducible STAT5 knockdown in the FLT3-ITD(+) MOLM-13 cell line, we show that dasatinib-mediated suppression of leukemia cell glycolytic activity is STAT5-independent and provide a preclinical rationale for combination treatment with quizartinib and dasatinib in FLT3-ITD(+) AML.","['Patel, Ami B', 'Pomicter, Anthony D', 'Yan, Dongqing', 'Eiring, Anna M', 'Antelope, Orlando', 'Schumacher, Jonathan A', 'Kelley, Todd W', 'Tantravahi, Srinivas K', 'Kovacsovics, Tibor J', 'Shami, Paul J', ""O'Hare, Thomas"", 'Deininger, Michael W']","['Patel AB', 'Pomicter AD', 'Yan D', 'Eiring AM', 'Antelope O', 'Schumacher JA', 'Kelley TW', 'Tantravahi SK', 'Kovacsovics TJ', 'Shami PJ', ""O'Hare T"", 'Deininger MW']","['Division of Hematology and Hematologic Malignancies, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, USA.', 'Huntsman Cancer Institute, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, USA.', 'Huntsman Cancer Institute, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, USA.', 'Huntsman Cancer Institute, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, USA.', 'Department of Molecular and Translational Medicine, Paul L.

Radiation and temozolomide (radio/TMZ) resistance are major contributors to cancer recurrence and failed GBM therapy. Heat shock proteins (HSPs), through regulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling and epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT), provide mechanistic pathways contributing to the development of GBM and radio/TMZ-resistant GBM. The Friend leukemia integration 1 (Fli-1) signaling network has been implicated in oncogenesis in GBM, making it an appealing target for advancing novel therapeutics. Fli-1 is linked to oncogenic transformation with up-regulation in radio/TMZ-resistant GBM, transcriptionally regulating HSPB1. This link led us to search for targeted molecules that inhibit Fli-1. Expression screening for Fli-1 inhibitors identified lumefantrine, an antimalarial drug, as a probable Fli-1 inhibitor. Docking and isothermal calorimetry titration confirmed interaction between lumefantrine and Fli-1. Lumefantrine promoted growth suppression and apoptosis in vitro in parental and radio/TMZ-resistant GBM and inhibited tumor growth without toxicity in vivo in U87MG GBM and radio/TMZ-resistant GBM orthotopic tumor models. These data reveal that lumefantrine, an FDA-approved drug, represents a potential GBM therapeutic that functions through inhibition of the Fli-1/HSPB1/EMT/ECM remodeling protein networks.","['Rajesh, Yetirajam', 'Biswas, Angana', 'Kumar, Utkarsh', 'Banerjee, Indranil', 'Das, Subhayan', 'Maji, Santanu', 'Das, Swadesh K', 'Emdad, Luni', 'Cavenee, Webster K', 'Mandal, Mahitosh', 'Fisher, Paul B']","['Rajesh Y', 'Biswas A', 'Kumar U', 'Banerjee I', 'Das S', 'Maji S', 'Das SK', 'Emdad L', 'Cavenee WK', 'Mandal M', 'Fisher PB']","['School of Medical Science and Technology, Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, West Bengal 721302, India.', 'Department of Human and Molecular Genetics, School of Medicine, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA 23298.', 'School of Medical Science and Technology, Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, West Bengal 721302, India.', 'Department of Biotechnology, Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, West Bengal 721302 India.', 'School of Medical Science and Technology, Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, West Bengal 721302, India.', 'School of Medical Science and Technology, Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, West Bengal 721302, India.', 'Department of Human and Molecular Genetics, School of Medicine, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA 23298.', 'Department of Human and Molecular Genetics, School of Medicine, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA 23298.', 'Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) Institute of Molecular Medicine, School of Medicine, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA 23298.', 'VCU Massey Cancer Center, School of Medicine, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA 23298.', 'Department of Human and Molecular Genetics, School of Medicine, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA 23298.', 'Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) Institute of Molecular Medicine, School of Medicine, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA 23298.', 'VCU Massey Cancer Center, School of Medicine, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA 23298.', 'Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093 wcavenee@ucsd.edu mahitosh@smst.iitkgp.ac.in paul.fisher@vcuhealth.org.', 'School of Medical Science and Technology, Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, West Bengal 721302, India; wcavenee@ucsd.edu mahitosh@smst.iitkgp.ac.in paul.fisher@vcuhealth.org.', 'Department of Human and Molecular Genetics, School of Medicine, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA 23298; wcavenee@ucsd.edu mahitosh@smst.iitkgp.ac.in paul.fisher@vcuhealth.org.', 'Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) Institute of Molecular Medicine, School of Medicine, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA 23298.', 'VCU Massey Cancer Center, School of Medicine, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA 23298.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200514,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Antimalarials)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '0 (FLII protein, human)', '0 (HSPB1 protein, human)', '0 (Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Microfilament Proteins)', '0 (Molecular Chaperones)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', 'F38R0JR742 (Lumefantrine)', 'YF1K15M17Y (Temozolomide)']",IM,"['Antimalarials/*administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/*administration & dosage', 'Brain Neoplasms/*drug therapy/radiotherapy', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Glioblastoma/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/radiotherapy', 'Heat-Shock Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lumefantrine/*administration & dosage', 'Microfilament Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Molecular Chaperones/genetics/metabolism', 'Temozolomide/*administration & dosage', 'Trans-Activators/genetics/metabolism']",PMC7275698,['NOTNLM'],"['*Fli-1', '*HSPB1', '*TMZ resistance', '*glioblastoma', '*radioresistance']",2020/05/16 06:00,2020/09/05 06:00,['2020/05/16 06:00'],"['2020/05/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/05 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/16 06:00 [entrez]']","['1921531117 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1921531117 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2020 Jun 2;117(22):12324-12331. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1921531117.

DESIGN: A retrospective analysis was conducted utilizing data from US databases of Truven Health Analytics. PATIENTS: We analyzed health insurance claims between January 2014 and December 2017 of patients diagnosed with hematological cancer: acute myeloid leukemia (AML), acute lymphoblastic leukemia, Hodgkin's lymphoma, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). METHODS: Patients with CDI after cancer diagnosis (CDI+, cases) were matched with patients without CDI reported (CDI-, controls). Matched cases and controls were compared to identify the CDI-associated costs in the 90 days following the onset of CDI. RESULTS: We matched 622 CDI+ patients with 11,111 CDI- patients. NHL (41.7%) and AML (30.9%) were the predominant underlying diseases in the CDI+ groups. During study period, the average time in-hospital of CDI+ patients was 23.1 days longer than for CDI- patients (P < 2x10-16). Overall, CDI onset increased costs of care by an average of US$57,159 per patient (P = 6x10-12), mainly driven by hospital costs. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms the significant economic burden associated with CDI in the United States, especially in patients with hematological malignancies. These findings highlight the need for prevention of CDI in this specific patient population.","['Duhalde, Lola', 'Lurienne, Lise', 'Wingen-Heimann, Sebastian M', 'Guillou, Lucien', 'Buffet, Renaud', 'Bandinelli, Pierre-Alain']","['Duhalde L', 'Lurienne L', 'Wingen-Heimann SM', 'Guillou L', 'Buffet R', 'Bandinelli PA']","['Da Volterra, Paris, France.', 'Ecole Polytechnique, Palaiseau, France.', 'Da Volterra, Paris, France.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospital of Cologne, Cologne, Germany.', 'FOM University of Applied Sciences, Cologne, Germany.', 'Da Volterra, Paris, France.', 'Faculty of Pharmacy, University Paris-Sud, Chatenay-Malabry, France.', 'Da Volterra, Paris, France.', 'Da Volterra, Paris, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200515,United States,Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol,Infection control and hospital epidemiology,8804099,,IM,"['Case-Control Studies', 'Clostridioides difficile', '*Clostridium Infections/economics', '*Cost of Illness', '*Cross Infection/economics', '*Hematologic Neoplasms/microbiology', 'Humans', 'Retrospective Studies', 'United States']",,,,2020/05/16 06:00,2021/08/18 06:00,['2020/05/16 06:00'],"['2020/05/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/18 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/16 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0899823X20001531 [pii]', '10.1017/ice.2020.153 [doi]']",ppublish,Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol. 2020 Jul;41(7):813-819. doi: 10.1017/ice.2020.153.

Although predominantly expressed in the heart, the role of SMYD2 in heart development has yet to be fully elucidated and has even been shown to be dispensable in a murine Nkx2-5-associated conditional knockout. Additionally, SMYD2 was recently shown to be necessary not only for lymphocyte development but also for the viability of hematopoietic leukemias. Based on the broad expression pattern of SMYD2 in mammalian tissues, it is likely that it plays pivotal roles in a host of additional normal and pathological processes. In this brief review, we consider what is currently known about the normal and pathogenic functions of SMYD2 and propose specific future directions for characterizing its role in embryogenesis.","['Jarrell, Dillon K', 'Hassell, Kelly N', 'Crans, Debbie C', 'Lanning, Shari', 'Brown, Mark A']","['Jarrell DK', 'Hassell KN', 'Crans DC', 'Lanning S', 'Brown MA']","['Department of Bioengineering, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO 80523, USA.', 'Cell and Molecular Biology Program, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO 80523, USA.', 'Cell and Molecular Biology Program, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO 80523, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO 80523, USA.', 'Department of Clinical Sciences, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO 80523, USA.', 'Cell and Molecular Biology Program, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO 80523, USA.', 'Department of Clinical Sciences, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO 80523, USA.', 'Epidemiology Section, Colorado School of Public Health, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO 80523, USA.']",['eng'],"['DGE-1553798/National Science Foundation', '1060548/National Science Foundation', '1930417/National Science Foundation']",['Journal Article'],20200512,Switzerland,Vet Sci,Veterinary sciences,101680127,,,,PMC7357037,['NOTNLM'],"['WNT', 'cancer', 'epigenetics', 'gonadotropin-releasing hormone', 'hematopoiesis', 'histone methylation', 'leukemia', 'mesendoderm', 'neural migration', 'vomeronasal organ']",2020/05/16 06:00,2020/05/16 06:01,['2020/05/16 06:00'],"['2020/04/09 00:00 [received]', '2020/04/28 00:00 [revised]', '2020/05/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/05/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/16 06:01 [medline]']","['vetsci7020063 [pii]', '10.3390/vetsci7020063 [doi]']",epublish,Vet Sci. 2020 May 12;7(2). pii: vetsci7020063. doi: 10.3390/vetsci7020063.,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-7792-3450', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2370-4310']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the molecular mode of action is highly versatile and ranges from direct transcriptional to post-transcriptional control, which includes RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) as crucial regulators of cell fate. RBPs coordinate RNA dynamics, including subcellular localization, translational efficiency and metabolism, by binding to their target messenger RNAs (mRNAs), thereby controlling the expression of the encoded proteins. In view of the growing interest in these regulators, this review summarizes recent research regarding the most influential RBPs relevant in acute leukemias in particular. The reported RBPs, either dysregulated or as components of fusion proteins, are described with respect to their functional domains, the pathways they affect, and clinical aspects associated with their dysregulation or altered functions.","['Schuschel, Konstantin', 'Helwig, Matthias', 'Huttelmaier, Stefan', 'Heckl, Dirk', 'Klusmann, Jan-Henning', 'Hoell, Jessica I']","['Schuschel K', 'Helwig M', 'Huttelmaier S', 'Heckl D', 'Klusmann JH', 'Hoell JI']","['Department of Pediatrics 1, Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg, 06120 Halle, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatrics 1, Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg, 06120 Halle, Germany.', 'Institute of Molecular Medicine, Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg, 06120 Halle, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatrics 1, Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg, 06120 Halle, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatrics 1, Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg, 06120 Halle, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatrics 1, Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg, 06120 Halle, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200512,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics/metabolism', 'Nucleic Acid Conformation', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Domains', 'RNA, Messenger/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism']",PMC7279408,['NOTNLM'],"['ALL', 'AML', 'CPSF6', 'IGF2BP', 'MSI2', 'RBM15-MKL1', 'RNA-binding protein', 'WT1', 'ZFP36', 'hematopoiesis', 'hnRNP K', 'nucleolin']",2020/05/16 06:00,2021/02/23 06:00,['2020/05/16 06:00'],"['2020/04/21 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/07 00:00 [revised]', '2020/05/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/05/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/23 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms21103409 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms21103409 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2020 May 12;21(10). pii: ijms21103409. doi: 10.3390/ijms21103409.,['ORCID: 0000-0002-1070-0727'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He and his partner expressed their desire to have a child. We recommended planning the pregnancy after the achievement of major molecular response and completion of TKI therapy because we could not promise complete safety of the fetus, However, he and his partner insisted on starting the TKI therapy immediately and planned the pregnancy during the therapy. The patient was started on nilotinib 600mg/body. CCyR, MMR, and CMR were achieved in 3, 8, and 12 months, respectively. The patient's partner got pregnant when he had been on TKI therapy for 15 months, and she gave birth to a healthy boy. Since many patients with CMLcan live for a long time after receiving TKI therapy, the quality of life of these patients is more important. Even if the percentage of patients with CML who are under 50 years of age is approximately 30%, the safety information of TKI with respect to pregnancy is unsatisfactory. Doctors struggle to address the problems of the patient's wish of childbearing, priority of TKI therapy, and fetal risks of the treatment. Although only a few cases of pregnancy and delivery of the partners of male patients with CML treated with TKI have been reported, all cases showed healthy childbirth and normal child growth.

Patients treated with hypomethylating agents (HMAs) for antecedent hematological malignancy (AHM) have suboptimal responses to induction chemotherapy upon transformation to AML. We investigated outcomes after various induction strategies in patients with sAML who had prior HMA exposure. We identified 242 patients with sAML who had prior HMA treatment for AHM and later received induction chemotherapy upon AML transformation and divided into 3 cohorts based on induction regimen: (A) CLAG/M (B) 7 + 3 and (C) CPX-351. The CR/CRi rate was 53% in cohort A, 32% in cohort B and 41.2% in cohort C (p = 0.005 between cohort A and B) (p = 0.329 between cohorts A and C) (p = 0.402 between cohorts B and C). The early death rates were not significantly different among the three cohorts (p = 0.200). In patients who received </=4 cycles of HMAs prior to AML transformation, response rates to CPX-351 were higher (64.3%) with a trend toward better overall survival (OS) (19.9 vs. 5.5 months) compared to >4 cycles (p = 0.092). There was no significant difference in median OS among the 3 groups: cohort A (7.27 months), cohort B (7.63 months) and cohort C (7.07 months) (p = 0.887). We demonstrate that CLAG/M and CPX-351 yield higher CR/CRi rates compared to 7 + 3 in patients with sAML after HMA failure. Median OS remains poor and did not differ among the 3 groups, illustrating the unmet need for more efficacious therapy for sAML patients following HMA failure.","['Talati, Chetasi', 'Goldberg, Aaron D', 'Przespolewski, Amanda', 'Chan, Onyee', 'Ali, Najla Al', 'Kim, Jongphil', 'Famulare, Chris', 'Sallman, David', 'Padron, Eric', 'Kuykendall, Andrew', 'Lancet, Jeffrey E', 'Wang, Eunice', 'Tallman, Martin S', 'Komrokji, Rami', 'Sweet, Kendra']","['Talati C', 'Goldberg AD', 'Przespolewski A', 'Chan O', 'Ali NA', 'Kim J', 'Famulare C', 'Sallman D', 'Padron E', 'Kuykendall A', 'Lancet JE', 'Wang E', 'Tallman MS', 'Komrokji R', 'Sweet K']","['Department of Malignant Hematology, Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, FL, United States.

The aim of this study was to determine the national seroprevalence and putative risk factors of Neospora caninum (N. caninum) in dairy cattle in Uruguay. A cross-sectional study was carried out. Herds were stratified by size (1-50, 51-250, and >250 cattle) and up to 60 dairy cows per herd were randomly selected. Four thousand two hundred twenty-three serum samples from 102 dairy herds were analyzed by indirect ELISA test, under the manufacturer's recommendations. In addition, the herdsman was surveyed and a population study was carried out. The in degree data, geographical coordinates, and seroprevalence of bovine viral diarrhea, enzootic bovine leukemia and infectious bovine rhinotracheitis were available for each herd. A sampling design was used to estimate population seroprevalence of N. caninum. In order to determine the factors associated with the disease, herds with an intra-herd seroprevalence over 20% were considered as case herds. Seroprevalence of N. caninum was 22.3% (95% CI: 18.7-25.9 %) and 96.0% (95% CI: 92.1-99.8%) at the animal and herd level, respectively. The number of dogs on the dairy farms were associated with infection levels (OR: 1.43, 95% CI: 1.02 to 2.03). It was concluded that N. caninum is endemic in the country, and is spreading over dairy herds. Although this study showed evidence that the number of dogs were associated with high levels of infection, more studies should be conducted, to better understand the epidemiology of the disease and thus develop efficient control measures.","['Macchi, Maria V', 'Suanes, Alejandra', 'Salaberry, Ximena', 'Fernandez, Federico', 'Piaggio, Jose', 'Gil, Andres D']","['Macchi MV', 'Suanes A', 'Salaberry X', 'Fernandez F', 'Piaggio J', 'Gil AD']","['Division de laboratorios Veterinarios, Ministerio de Ganaderia, Agricultura y Pesca, Montevideo, Uruguay.

We found 86 articles describing 123 cases of patients with ophthalmic involvement associated with CLL. Ophthalmic symptoms were CLL's first manifestation in 25.6% of patients and revealed Richter transformation in 11.0%. There were three main causes of ophthalmic features: CLL-infiltration (52.0%), lymphoma (26.0%), and infection (15.4%), with specific clinical and radiological characteristics. CLL-infiltration was mostly bilateral, whereas lymphoma was usually unilateral (P = 0.02). Optic neuropathy was always secondary to CLL-infiltration, and in those cases, cerebrospinal fluid immunophenotyping was a potential alternative to invasive biopsy as it confirmed the diagnosis in 4 patients (36.4%). On the contrary, lymphoma usually presented as adnexal involvement (P = 0.04), particularly as an orbital mass (P = 0.004). Infections concerned mostly patients previously treated for CLL (P < 0.0001), and main presentations included posterior uveitis (P = 0.0002) and retinal infiltrates (P < 0.0001). Overall, the prognosis was poor, as 29.3% of the patients died within 36 months of follow-up, and 26.1% had a partial or total visual loss. Eye infections were associated with the poorest prognosis as 47% of patients died, with a 6-month-median survival.","['Delestre, Florence', 'Blanche, Philippe', 'Bouayed, Emna', 'Bouscary, Didier', 'Mouthon, Luc', 'Brezin, Antoine', 'Le Jeunne, Claire', 'Chaigne, Benjamin']","['Delestre F', 'Blanche P', 'Bouayed E', 'Bouscary D', 'Mouthon L', 'Brezin A', 'Le Jeunne C', 'Chaigne B']","[""Service de Medecine Interne, Centre de Reference Maladies systemiques auto-immunes rares d'Ile de France, Hopital Cochin, Universite Paris Descartes, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris (AP-HP), Paris, France."", ""Service de Medecine Interne, Centre de Reference Maladies systemiques auto-immunes rares d'Ile de France, Hopital Cochin, Universite Paris Descartes, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris (AP-HP), Paris, France."", ""Service d'ophtalmologie, Hopital Cochin, Universite Paris Descartes, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris (AP-HP), Paris, France."", ""Service d'hematologie, Hopital Cochin, Universite Paris Descartes, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris (AP-HP), Paris, France."", ""Service de Medecine Interne, Centre de Reference Maladies systemiques auto-immunes rares d'Ile de France, Hopital Cochin, Universite Paris Descartes, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris (AP-HP), Paris, France."", ""Service d'ophtalmologie, Hopital Cochin, Universite Paris Descartes, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris (AP-HP), Paris, France."", ""Service de Medecine Interne, Centre de Reference Maladies systemiques auto-immunes rares d'Ile de France, Hopital Cochin, Universite Paris Descartes, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris (AP-HP), Paris, France."", ""Service de Medecine Interne, Centre de Reference Maladies systemiques auto-immunes rares d'Ile de France, Hopital Cochin, Universite Paris Descartes, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris (AP-HP), Paris, France.

Among these, viral non-coding RNAs are invisible to the immune system and may affect the fate of the host cell. Bovine leukemia virus (BLV) encodes both short (miRNAs) and long (antisense AS1 and AS2) non-coding RNAs. To elucidate the mechanisms associated with BLV non-coding RNAs, we performed phenotypic and transcriptomic analyzes in a reverse genetics system. RNA sequencing of B-lymphocytes revealed that cell proliferation is the most significant mechanism associated with ablation of the viral non-coding RNAs. To assess the biological relevance of this observation, we determined the cell kinetic parameters in vivo using intravenous injection of BrdU and CFSE. Fitting the data to a mathematical model provided the rates of cell proliferation and death. Our data show that deletion of miRNAs correlates with reduced proliferation of the infected cell and lack of pathogenesis.","['Safari, Roghaiyeh', 'Jacques, Jean-Rock', 'Brostaux, Yves', 'Willems, Luc']","['Safari R', 'Jacques JR', 'Brostaux Y', 'Willems L']","['Molecular and Cellular Epigenetics (GIGA), University of Liege, Sart-Tilman Liege, Belgium.', 'Molecular and Cellular Biology (TERRA), Gembloux Agro-Bio Tech, University of Liege, Gembloux, Belgium.', 'Molecular and Cellular Epigenetics (GIGA), University of Liege, Sart-Tilman Liege, Belgium.', 'Molecular and Cellular Biology (TERRA), Gembloux Agro-Bio Tech, University of Liege, Gembloux, Belgium.', 'Modelisation and development, Gembloux Agro-Bio Tech, University of Liege, Gembloux, Belgium.', 'Molecular and Cellular Epigenetics (GIGA), University of Liege, Sart-Tilman Liege, Belgium.', 'Molecular and Cellular Biology (TERRA), Gembloux Agro-Bio Tech, University of Liege, Gembloux, Belgium.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200514,United States,PLoS Pathog,PLoS pathogens,101238921,"['0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (RNA, Antisense)', '0 (RNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', '*B-Lymphocytes/metabolism/pathology/virology', 'Cattle', 'Cell Proliferation', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', '*Leukemia Virus, Bovine/genetics/metabolism/pathogenicity', '*MicroRNAs/genetics/metabolism', '*RNA, Antisense/genetics/metabolism', '*RNA, Viral/genetics/metabolism']",PMC7252678,,,2020/05/15 06:00,2020/07/22 06:00,['2020/05/15 06:00'],"['2020/01/27 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/27 00:00 [revised]', '2020/05/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/22 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/15 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1371/journal.ppat.1008502 [doi]', 'PPATHOGENS-D-20-00159 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS Pathog. 2020 May 14;16(5):e1008502. doi: 10.1371/journal.ppat.1008502. eCollection 2020 May.,"['ORCID: 0000-0003-4563-8414', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8200-5080', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0563-2213']",['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, further research is necessary to find an optimal cure that responds to the individual needs of the patient. Areas covered: This review discusses new agents in phase 1 and 2 clinical trials currently underway in CLL patients. A literature review of the MEDLINE database for articles in English concerning novel drugs, clinical trials, phase 1, phase 2 and CLL was conducted via PubMed. Publications from 2000 through January 2020 were scrutinized. Conference proceedings from the previous five years of the American Society of Hematology, European Hematology Association and American Society of Clinical Oncology were searched manually. Additional relevant publications were obtained by reviewing the references from the chosen articles. The search also included clinical trials registered in clinicaltrials.gov. Expert opinion: The use of BTK and PI3Kdelta inhibitors and BCL-2 antagonist have changed the treatment strategy of CLL. Several clinical trials with novel, unapproved agents are currently ongoing. Their findings should define the role of these novel drugs in the treatment of patients with previously untreated and RR CLL.","['Iskierka-Jazdzewska, Elzbieta', 'Robak, Tadeusz']","['Iskierka-Jazdzewska E', 'Robak T']","['Department of Hematology, Copernicus Memorial Hospital, Lodz, Medical University of Lodz , Lodz, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology, Copernicus Memorial Hospital, Lodz, Medical University of Lodz , Lodz, Poland.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200527,England,Expert Opin Investig Drugs,Expert opinion on investigational drugs,9434197,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BCL2 protein, human)', '0 (Drugs, Investigational)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', 'EC 2.7.1.137 (Class I Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.1.137 (PIK3CD protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (BTK protein, human)']",IM,"['Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Class I Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Clinical Trials, Phase I as Topic', 'Clinical Trials, Phase II as Topic', 'Drug Development', 'Drugs, Investigational/*administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/antagonists & inhibitors']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Acalabrutinib', 'BTK inhibitors', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'cirmtuzumab phase1', 'phase 2', 'umbralisib', 'vecabrutinib', 'voruciclib']",2020/05/15 06:00,2021/01/28 06:00,['2020/05/15 06:00'],"['2020/05/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/28 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/15 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/13543784.2020.1770225 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Investig Drugs. 2020 Jul;29(7):709-722. doi: 10.1080/13543784.2020.1770225.

The aim of this study is to evaluate the incidence of VZV infection, antiviral therapy and outcome in children with ALL treated in polish hemato-oncological centers between 2012 and 2019 years. This study included medical records of 1874 patients, aged 1 to 18 years, with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia. During chemotherapy, 406 children out of 1874 (21.6%) experienced viral infections. The incidence of VZV infection in the whole group children with ALL was 1.8%. Among them, 34 (8.4%) patients were diagnosed with VZV infection. Thirty-five episodes of viral infections were identified. The median time of VCV therapy was 12 days. Herpes zoster infection occurred in 24 (70.6%) children, and varicella in 10 (29.4%) ones. The average time from the start of chemotherapy to the appearance of herpes zoster was 7.26 +/- 4.05 months. VZV infection occurred mainly during the maintenance therapy, the reinduction and induction phases. There was no correlation between steroid dosage or type and subsequent zoster. The total lymphocyte count of these patients on the first day of zoster was reduced. No serious complications were observed due to this infection. All patients survived. In conclusion, a low incidence of VZV infection was observed among pediatric patients with ALL in Poland. This analysis indicates that currently used therapeutic methods are effective in children with cancer and VZV infection. The main focus should be on the prevention of delayed chemotherapy.","['Zawitkowska, Joanna', 'Lejman, Monika', 'Szmydki-Baran, Anna', 'Zaucha-Prazmo, Agnieszka', 'Czyzewski, Krzysztof', 'Dziedzic,

We conducted an RCT on the effectiveness of a self-management intervention among patients with lymphoma in a population-based setting. OBJECTIVE: The objectives of the current study were to describe the proportion of RCT participants compared to all patients invited to participate, and compare sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of RCT participants with all respondents, all patients invited to participate, and all patients selected from the Netherlands Cancer Registry (NCR) to determine the reach of the intervention. An additional objective was to assess differences on RCT outcome variables between RCT and paper respondents. METHODS: Patients with lymphoma or chronic lymphocytic leukemia >/=18 years old at diagnosis from 13 hospitals in the Netherlands were selected from the population-based NCR, which routinely collects data on sociodemographic and clinical characteristics. Eligible patients were invited to participate in an RCT and complete a questionnaire. Web-based completion determined RCT enrollment, whereas paper respondents were followed observationally. RESULTS: A total of 1193 patients were selected from the NCR, 892 (74.77%) of whom were invited to participate in the trial by their hematologist after verifying eligibility. Among those invited, 25.4% (227/892) completed the web-based questionnaire and were enrolled in the RCT. The RCT participants were younger and there was a higher proportion of men than nonparticipants (P<.001). In addition, 25.7% (229/892) of those invited opted to participate in the paper-based observational follow-up study. Compared with paper respondents, RCT participants were younger (P<.001), with a higher proportion of men (P=.002), and had higher education levels (P=.02). RCT participants more often wanted to receive all available information on their disease (P<.001), whereas paper respondents reported higher levels of emotional distress (P=.009). CONCLUSIONS: From a population-based sample of eligible patients, the participation rate in the RCT was approximately 25%. RCT participants may not be representative of the target population because of different sociodemographic and clinical characteristics. Since RCT participants represent a minority of the target population, RCT results should be interpreted with caution as patients in the RCT may be those least in need of a self-management intervention.

It is often associated with infectious complications. Mathematical modeling, simulation, and optimization of the treatment process would be a valuable tool to support clinical decision making, potentially resulting in less severe side effects and deeper remissions. However, until now, there has been no validated mathematical model available to simulate the effect of chemotherapy treatment on white blood cell (WBC) counts and leukemic cells simultaneously. METHODS: We developed a population pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) model combining a myelosuppression model considering endogenous granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), a PK model for cytarabine (Ara-C), a subcutaneous absorption model for exogenous G-CSF, and a two-compartment model for leukemic blasts. This model was fitted to data of 44 AML patients during consolidation therapy with a novel Ara-C plus G-CSF schedule from a phase II controlled clinical trial. Additionally, we were able to optimize treatment schedules with respect to disease progression, WBC nadirs, and the amount of Ara-C and G-CSF. RESULTS: The developed PK/PD model provided good prediction accuracies and an interpretation of the interaction between WBCs, G-CSF, and blasts. For 14 patients (those with available bone marrow blast counts), we achieved a median 4.2-fold higher WBC count at nadir, which is the most critical time during consolidation therapy. The simulation results showed that relative bone marrow blast counts remained below the clinically important threshold of 5%, with a median of 60% reduction in Ara-C. CONCLUSION: These in silico findings demonstrate the benefits of optimized treatment schedules for AML patients. SIGNIFICANCE: Until 2017, no new drug had been approved for the treatment of AML, fostering the optimal use of currently available drugs.","['Jost, Felix', 'Schalk, Enrico', 'Weber, Daniela', 'Dohner, Hartmut', 'Fischer, Thomas', 'Sager, Sebastian']","['Jost F', 'Schalk E', 'Weber D', 'Dohner H', 'Fischer T', 'Sager S']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20201119,United States,IEEE Trans Biomed Eng,IEEE transactions on bio-medical engineering,0012737,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow', 'Cytarabine/adverse effects', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor', '*Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy']",,,,2020/05/15 06:00,2021/06/25 06:00,['2020/05/15 06:00'],"['2020/05/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/25 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/15 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1109/TBME.2020.2982749 [doi]'],ppublish,IEEE Trans Biomed Eng. 2020 Dec;67(12):3296-3306. doi: 10.1109/TBME.2020.2982749.

This discovery led to subsequent studies that confirmed our findings and to additional larger studies that demonstrated a 1% frequency of germline ETV6 mutations among 4405 individuals with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Additionally, a 4.5% prevalence of ETV6 germline mutations was reported in families with inherited thrombocytopenia. Preliminary data suggest that decreased ETV6 function leads to MK maturation arrest, impaired platelet production and differentially expressed platelet transcripts among individuals affected with ETV6 mutations when compared to control relatives. Additionally, individuals with some ETV6 mutation exhibit bleeding that appears disproportionate to the mildly reduced platelet count, suggesting a platelet function deficit. Furthermore, recent studies describe decreased ability of platelets from individuals with ETV6 mutations to spread on fibrinogen covered surfaces. Overall, ETV6 germline mutations represent a new cancer predisposition thrombocytopenia with platelet dysfunction.","['Di Paola, Jorge', 'Fisher, Marlie H']","['Di Paola J', 'Fisher MH']","['Department of Pediatrics, Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis , St. Louis, Missouri, USA.', 'Medical Scientist Training Program, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus , Aurora, Colorado, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus , Aurora, Colorado, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 HL120728/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL139825/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM008497/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM008730/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",['Journal Article'],20200514,England,Platelets,Platelets,9208117,,IM,"['Blood Platelet Disorders/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Thrombocytopenia/*genetics']",PMC7666051,['NOTNLM'],"['Bleeding', 'ETV6', 'thrombocytopenia']",2020/05/15 06:00,2021/08/24 06:00,['2020/05/15 06:00'],"['2020/05/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/24 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/15 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/09537104.2020.1760229 [doi]'],ppublish,Platelets. 2021 Jan 2;32(1):141-143. doi: 10.1080/09537104.2020.1760229.

The outcomes of interest were mortality from cancers of the esophagus, stomach, intestine, rectum, bladder, liver, pancreas, larynx, lung, skin, prostate, brain, and female breast, as well as leukemia. This report includes 5472 deaths from cancer, more than ten times the numbers of deaths in our last summary report published 20 years ago. Methods Standardized mortality ratios were computed for the entire study period. Adjusted hazard ratios (HR) were estimated in Cox proportional hazard models with categorical variables for cumulative exposure to each type of MWF. Results Exposure-response patterns are consistent with prior mortality reports from this cohort. We found increased risk of skin and female breast cancer with straight fluids. For the first time, we found elevated risk of stomach cancer mortality. Overall, many of the exposure-response results did not suggest an association with MWF. Conclusions Mortality is a poor proxy for cancer diagnosis for treatable cancers and not the optimal outcome measure in etiological studies. Although the HR presented here handle bias from the healthy worker hire effect and left truncation, they do not handle bias from healthy worker survivor effect, which likely results in underestimates of the health impacts of MWF. Although this updated summary provides some information on the risk of cancer from MWF, targeted future analyses will help clarify associations.","['Costello, Sadie', 'Chen, Kevin', 'Picciotto, Sally', 'Lutzker, Liza', 'Eisen, Ellen']","['Costello S', 'Chen K', 'Picciotto S', 'Lutzker L', 'Eisen E']","['Environmental Health Science, School of Public Health, University of California, Berkeley, 2121 Berkeley Way #5302, Berkeley, CA 94720-7360, USA.

The recent studies have shown that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play an important role in different cellular processes, such as cell cycle control and proliferation. Plasmacytoma variant translocation 1 (PVT1) is one of those lncRNAs that is significantly upregulated in AML. LncRNAs could be downregulated or blocked by locked nucleic acids (LNA) which are oligonucleotide strands. METHODS: In this study, lncRNA PVT1 was blocked by antisense LNA GapmeRs in human bone marrow cancerous blast cells. Cells were transfected with PVT1 antisense LNA GapmeRs at 24, 48, and 72 h post-transfection. Quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was accomplished to evaluate the PVT1 and c-Myc expression. Cell viability was evaluated by MTT assay, and apoptosis and necrosis were assessed by Annexin V/propidium iodide staining assay. RESULTS: The results of this study indicated that the downregulation of PVT1 in blast cells could induce apoptosis, and necrosis and reduce cell viability. The expression of c-Myc was downregulated by blockage of PVT1 and it shows that the expression of these two genes are correlated. CONCLUSION: The findings declare that inhibition of PVT1 could be a new target in the treatment of AML-M0 and help to approach more to treatments with fewer side effects.","['Ghadiri, A', 'Sharifi, M', 'Mehrzad, V', 'Bagheri, P']","['Ghadiri A', 'Sharifi M', 'Mehrzad V', 'Bagheri P']","['Department of Genetics and Molecular Biology, School of Medicine, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, 81744-176, Isfahan, Iran.', 'Department of Genetics and Molecular Biology, School of Medicine, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, 81744-176, Isfahan, Iran. mo_sharifi@med.mui.ac.ir.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology, School of Medicine, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran.', 'Department of Genetics and Molecular Biology, School of Medicine, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, 81744-176, Isfahan, Iran.']",['eng'],['396877/Isfahan University of Medical Sciences'],['Journal Article'],20200514,Italy,Clin Transl Oncol,Clinical & translational oncology : official publication of the Federation of Spanish Oncology Societies and of the National Cancer Institute of Mexico,101247119,"['0 (MYC protein, human)', '0 (PVT1 long-non-coding RNA, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*physiology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/physiology', 'RNA, Long Noncoding/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloblastic leukemia', 'LNA GapmeRs', 'PVT1', 'c-Myc']",2020/05/15 06:00,2021/07/08 06:00,['2020/05/15 06:00'],"['2020/01/29 00:00 [received]', '2020/04/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/08 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/15 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12094-020-02360-4 [doi]', '10.1007/s12094-020-02360-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Clin Transl Oncol. 2020 Nov;22(11):2103-2110. doi: 10.1007/s12094-020-02360-4.

Alternative splicing of several genes has been linked to the progression of the disease, but involvement of alternations in splicing profiles has not been reported. RNA-seq of peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples characterized the differentially expressed and spliced transcripts in five CML chronic phase (CP) and five blast phase (BP) patients, and five healthy controls. Global splicing alteration analysis detected 6474 altered splicing events altered between CML and healthy samples, including many of the previously reported splicing variants and showing a more profound altered splicing deregulation in BP samples. Functional clustering of differentially spliced genes in CP revealed a preferred enrichment relating to cell signaling, while the spliceosome pathway was most overrepresented in BP samples. One differentially spliced spliceosome gene hnRNPA1 showed two splice isoforms; the longer isoform contained exon 8 was preferentially expressed in the BP patients, and the short one excluding exon 8 was specific to healthy controls. Our findings suggested that alternative splicing deregulation played a central role during the progression of CML from CP to BP, and the longer isoform of hnRNPA1 might represent a diagnostic marker and therapeutic target for CML.","['Li, Shu-Qi', 'Liu, Jing', 'Zhang, Jing', 'Wang, Xue-Lian', 'Chen, Dong', 'Wang, Yan', 'Xu, Yan-Mei', 'Huang, Bo', 'Lin, Jin', 'Li, Jing', 'Wang, Xiao-Zhong']","['Li SQ', 'Liu J', 'Zhang J', 'Wang XL', 'Chen D', 'Wang Y', 'Xu YM', 'Huang B', 'Lin J', 'Li J', 'Wang XZ']","['Jiangxi Province Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medicine, Department of Clinical Laboratory, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, No.1 Min De Road, Nanchang 330006, China.', 'Jiangxi Province Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medicine, Department of Clinical Laboratory, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, No.1 Min De Road, Nanchang 330006, China.', 'Jiangxi Province Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medicine, Department of Clinical Laboratory, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, No.1 Min De Road, Nanchang 330006, China.', 'Center for Genome Analysis, ABLife Inc., Wuhan 430075, China.', 'Center for Genome Analysis, ABLife Inc., Wuhan 430075, China.', 'Jiangxi Province Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medicine, Department of Clinical Laboratory, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, No.1 Min De Road, Nanchang 330006, China.', 'Jiangxi Province Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medicine, Department of Clinical Laboratory, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, No.1 Min De Road, Nanchang 330006, China.', 'Jiangxi Province Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medicine, Department of Clinical Laboratory, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, No.1 Min De Road, Nanchang 330006, China.', 'Jiangxi Province Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medicine, Department of Clinical Laboratory, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, No.1 Min De Road, Nanchang 330006, China.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, No.17 Yong Wai Road, Nanchang 330006, China.', 'Jiangxi Province Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medicine, Department of Clinical Laboratory, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, No.1 Min De Road, Nanchang 330006, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200428,Egypt,J Adv Res,Journal of advanced research,101546952,,,,PMC7210475,['NOTNLM'],"['AS', 'CML', 'RNA-seq', 'hnRNPA1']",2020/05/15 06:00,2020/05/15 06:01,['2020/05/15 06:00'],"['2019/11/18 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/08 00:00 [revised]', '2020/04/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/05/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/15 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1016/j.jare.2020.04.016 [doi]', 'S2090-1232(20)30078-3 [pii]']",epublish,J Adv Res. 2020 Apr 28;24:301-310. doi: 10.1016/j.jare.2020.04.016. eCollection 2020 Jul.,,"['The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or', 'personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in', 'this paper.']",['(c) 2020 THE AUTHORS.

Data of this review have been collected from the scientific articles published in databases such as Science Direct, Scopus, PubMed, and Scientific Information Database from 1982 to 2019. According to various literature, crocin inhibits tumor growth, and its spread in several types of cancer including colorectal, pancreatic, breast, and prostate, as well as chronic myelogenous and leukemia. It inhibits telomerase activity, microtubule polymerization, cyclin D1, nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB), multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP1), and MRP2 overexpression. Crocin can induce apoptosis through activation of caspase 8, up-regulation of p53 expression, Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, and down-regulation expression of Bcl-2, survivin, and cyclin D1. It also down-regulates matrix metalloproteinase 2 and 9 (MMP2 and MMP9), N-cadherin, and beta-catenin expression, which are involved in tumor invasion and metastasis. Tumor invasion was also inhibited by crocin through increasing E-cadherin expression, cell cycle suppression at G1, G0/G1, S, and G2/M phases. Crocin has therapeutic and preventive effects on cancer cells line. Therefore, it has been suggested that this agent can be administered in patients that suffer from this problem.","['Veisi, Ali', 'Akbari, Ghaidafeh', 'Mard, Seyyed Ali', 'Badfar, Gholamreza', 'Zarezade, Vahid', 'Mirshekar, Mohammad Ali']","['Veisi A', 'Akbari G', 'Mard SA', 'Badfar G', 'Zarezade V', 'Mirshekar MA']","['Behbahan Faculty of Medical Sciences, Behbahan, Iran.', 'Medicinal Plants Research Center, Yasuj University of Medical Sciences, Yasuj, Iran.', 'Research Center for Infectious Diseases of Digestive System [Alimentary Tract Research Center], Physiology Research Center (PRC), Department of Physiology, School of Medicine, Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences, Ahvaz, Iran.', 'Department of pediatrics, Behbahan Faculty of Medical Sciences, Behbahan, Iran.', 'Behbahan Faculty of Medical Sciences, Behbahan, Iran.', 'Department of Physiology, School of Medicine, Zahedan University of Medical Sciences, Zahedan, Iran.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Iran,Iran J Basic Med Sci,Iranian journal of basic medical sciences,101517966,,,,PMC7206843,['NOTNLM'],"['Cancer', 'Cell line', 'Crocin', 'Review', 'Tumor']",2020/05/15 06:00,2020/05/15 06:01,['2020/05/15 06:00'],"['2020/05/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/05/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/15 06:01 [medline]']",['10.22038/IJBMS.2019.37821.8995 [doi]'],ppublish,Iran J Basic Med Sci. 2020 Jan;23(1):3-12. doi: 10.22038/IJBMS.2019.37821.8995.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The incidence of engraftment syndrome, a transplant complication potentially related to endothelium, has increased in the last years. Our aim was to investigate whether bortezomib (Velcade, V), thalidomide (T), and dexamethasone (D) affect the endothelium, and explore defibrotide (DF) as protective agent. Endothelial cells (ECs) in culture were exposed to the compounds separately or in combination, without (VTD) and with DF (VTD + DF). Changes in markers of: (i) inflammation (ICAM-1 expression and leukocyte adhesion), (ii) VWF production, (iii) cell permeability (VE-cadherin expression and cell monolayer integrity), and (iv) oxidative stress (ROS production and eNOS expression) were measured. ICAM-1 and VWF expression increased significantly in VTD but were similar to controls in VTD + DF. Separately, bortezomib was the main deleterious agent whereas dexamethasone showed no harmful effect. Leukocyte adhesion showed similar trends. VE-cadherin expression was lower in VTD and normalized in VTD + DF. EC permeability increased only with bortezomib. No changes were observed in oxidative stress markers. Our results demonstrate that bortezomib damages the endothelium, and DF prevents this effect. A better knowledge of the induction drugs impact will allow the design of measures to protect the endothelium.","['Martinez-Sanchez, Julia', 'Palomo, Marta', 'Torramade-Moix, Sergi', 'Moreno-Castano, Ana Belen', 'Rovira, Montserrat', 'Gutierrez-Garcia, Gonzalo', 'Fernandez-Aviles, Francesc', 'Escolar, Gines', 'Penack, Olaf', 'Rosinol, Laura', 'Carreras, Enric', 'Diaz-Ricart, Maribel']","['Martinez-Sanchez J', 'Palomo M', 'Torramade-Moix S', 'Moreno-Castano AB', 'Rovira M', 'Gutierrez-Garcia G', 'Fernandez-Aviles F', 'Escolar G', 'Penack O', 'Rosinol L', 'Carreras E', 'Diaz-Ricart M']","['Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute, Hospital Clinic de Barcelona, Universitat de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', ""Hematopathology, Department of Pathology, Centre de Diagnostic Biomedic (CDB), Hospital Clinic de Barcelona, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Universitat de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain."", 'Barcelona Endothelium Team, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute, Hospital Clinic de Barcelona, Universitat de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', ""Hematopathology, Department of Pathology, Centre de Diagnostic Biomedic (CDB), Hospital Clinic de Barcelona, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Universitat de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain."", 'Barcelona Endothelium Team, Barcelona, Spain.', ""Hematopathology, Department of Pathology, Centre de Diagnostic Biomedic (CDB), Hospital Clinic de Barcelona, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Universitat de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain."", ""Hematopathology, Department of Pathology, Centre de Diagnostic Biomedic (CDB), Hospital Clinic de Barcelona, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Universitat de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain."", 'Stem Cell Transplantation Unit, IDIBAPS, Hospital Clinic de Barcelona, Universitat de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Stem Cell Transplantation Unit, IDIBAPS, Hospital Clinic de Barcelona, Universitat de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Stem Cell Transplantation Unit, IDIBAPS, Hospital Clinic de Barcelona, Universitat de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', ""Hematopathology, Department of Pathology, Centre de Diagnostic Biomedic (CDB), Hospital Clinic de Barcelona, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Universitat de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain."", 'Hematology, Oncology and Tumor Immunology Department, Charite Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany.', 'Berlin-Brandenburg Center for Regenerative Therapies, Berlin, Germany.', 'Berlin Institute of Health, Berlin, Germany.', 'Stem Cell Transplantation Unit, IDIBAPS, Hospital Clinic de Barcelona, Universitat de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Amyloidosis and Multiple Myeloma/AL Unit, Department of Hematology, Hospital Clinic de Barcelona, Universitat de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute, Hospital Clinic de Barcelona, Universitat de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Barcelona Endothelium Team, Barcelona, Spain.', ""Hematopathology, Department of Pathology, Centre de Diagnostic Biomedic (CDB), Hospital Clinic de Barcelona, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Universitat de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain. mdiaz@clinic.cat."", 'Barcelona Endothelium Team, Barcelona, Spain. mdiaz@clinic.cat.']",['eng'],"['IST-16-10355/Jazz Pharmaceuticals (Jazz Pharmaceuticals plc)', 'PIE15/00027/Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness | Instituto de Salud Carlos', 'III (Institute of Health Carlos III)', 'DTS16/00133/Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness | Instituto de Salud Carlos', 'III (Institute of Health Carlos III)', 'PI19/00888/Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness | Instituto de Salud Carlos', 'III (Institute of Health Carlos III)', '2017-SGR675/Generalitat de Catalunya (Government of Catalonia)']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200513,England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,"['69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols', 'Bortezomib/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Endothelium', 'Humans', '*Multiple Myeloma/drug therapy', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",,,,2020/05/15 06:00,2021/06/22 06:00,['2020/05/15 06:00'],"['2020/03/18 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/04/30 00:00 [revised]', '2020/05/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/22 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/15 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41409-020-0947-9 [doi]', '10.1038/s41409-020-0947-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2020 Dec;55(12):2270-2278. doi: 10.1038/s41409-020-0947-9.

To improve current approaches to combination treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and gain insights into the underlying biology, we studied the effect of 352 drug combination pairs in multiple concentrations by analysing ex vivo drug response of 52 primary CLL samples, which were characterized by ""omics"" profiling. Known synergistic interactions were confirmed for B-cell receptor (BCR) inhibitors with Bcl-2 inhibitors and with chemotherapeutic drugs, suggesting that this approach can identify clinically useful combinations. Moreover, we uncovered synergistic interactions between BCR inhibitors and afatinib, which we attribute to BCR activation by afatinib through BLK upstream of BTK and PI3K. Combinations of multiple inhibitors of BCR components (e.g., BTK, PI3K, SYK) had effects similar to the single agents. While PI3K and BTK inhibitors produced overall similar effects in combinations with other drugs, we uncovered a larger response heterogeneity of combinations including PI3K inhibitors, predominantly in CLL with mutated IGHV, which we attribute to the target's position within the BCR-signaling pathway. Taken together, our study shows that drug combination effects can be effectively queried in primary cancer cells, which could aid discovery, triage and clinical development of drug combinations.","['Lukas, Marina', 'Velten, Britta', 'Sellner, Leopold', 'Tomska, Katarzyna', 'Huellein, Jennifer', 'Walther, Tatjana', 'Wagner, Lena', 'Muley, Carolin', 'Wu, Bian', 'Oles, Malgorzata', 'Dietrich, Sascha', 'Jethwa, Alexander', 'Bohnenberger, Hanibal', 'Lu, Junyan', 'Huber, Wolfgang', 'Zenz, Thorsten']","['Lukas M', 'Velten B', 'Sellner L', 'Tomska K', 'Huellein J', 'Walther T', 'Wagner L', 'Muley C', 'Wu B', 'Oles M', 'Dietrich S', 'Jethwa A', 'Bohnenberger H', 'Lu J', 'Huber W', 'Zenz T']","['Department of Molecular Therapy in Haematology and Oncology, DKFZ & NCT Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine II, Klinikum Rechts der Isar, TU Munchen, Munchen, Germany.', 'Genome Biology Unit, EMBL, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Molecular Therapy in Haematology and Oncology, DKFZ & NCT Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine V, Heidelberg University Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Molecular Therapy in Haematology and Oncology, DKFZ & NCT Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University Hospital Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Molecular Therapy in Haematology and Oncology, DKFZ & NCT Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Genome Biology Unit, EMBL, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Molecular Therapy in Haematology and Oncology, DKFZ & NCT Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Molecular Therapy in Haematology and Oncology, DKFZ & NCT Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Molecular Therapy in Haematology and Oncology, DKFZ & NCT Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Molecular Therapy in Haematology and Oncology, DKFZ & NCT Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Genome Biology Unit, EMBL, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine V, Heidelberg University Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Molecular Therapy in Haematology and Oncology, DKFZ & NCT Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology, University Medical Center Gottingen, Gottingen, Germany.', 'Genome Biology Unit, EMBL, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Genome Biology Unit, EMBL, Heidelberg, Germany. wolfgang.huber@embl.de.', 'Department of Medical Oncology and Haematology, University Hospital Zurich and University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland. thorsten.zenz@usz.ch.']",['eng'],"['(""Mildred-Scheel"" professorship/Deutsche Krebshilfe (German Cancer', 'Aid)/International', 'Physician Scientist Program/University of Heidelberg | Medizinischen Fakultat', 'Heidelberg, Universitat Heidelberg (Medical Faculty of Heidelberg, University of', 'Heidelberg)/International', 'TRANSCAN IV (GCL-CLL)/EC | Horizon 2020 Framework Programme (EU Framework', 'Programme for Research and Innovation H2020)/International']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200513,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', '*Drug Evaluation, Preclinical/methods/standards', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Drug Synergism', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing/methods/standards', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Primary Cell Culture', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Reproducibility of Results']",PMC7584477,,,2020/05/15 06:00,2020/12/01 06:00,['2020/05/15 06:00'],"['2019/11/08 00:00 [received]', '2020/04/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/04/16 00:00 [revised]', '2020/05/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/01 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/15 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-020-0846-5 [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-020-0846-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2020 Nov;34(11):2934-2950. doi: 10.1038/s41375-020-0846-5.

We recently introduced a novel flow cytometry assay to detect T-cell clones in blood and bone marrow, based on the identification of a monophasic T-cell receptor (TCR) beta chain constant region-1 (TRBC1) expression pattern within a phenotypically distinct TCRalphabeta T-cell subset. In routine laboratory practice, T-cell clones of uncertain significance (T-CUS) were detected in 42 of 159 (26%) patients without T-cell malignancy, and in 3 of 24 (13%) healthy donors. Their phenotype (CD8(+)/CD4(-): 78%, CD4(-)/CD8(-): 12%, CD4(+)/CD8(+): 9%, or CD4(+)/CD8(-): 2%) closely resembled that of 26 cases of T-cell large granular lymphocytic leukemia (T-LGLL) studied similarly, except for a much smaller clone size (p < 0.0001), slightly brighter CD2 and CD7, and slightly dimmer CD3 expression (p < 0.05). T-CUS was not associated with age, gender, comorbidities, or peripheral blood counts. TCR-Vbeta repertoire analysis confirmed the clonality of T-CUS, and identified additional clonotypic CD8-positive subsets when combined with TRBC1 analysis.

Most of these cases present a normal karyotype, and their risk and/or prognostic category are uncertain. We searched our database and identified 41 CML patients (20 M/21 F, median age: 47 years, range 12-78 years) with insertion-derived BCR-ABL1 confirmed by various FISH techniques: 31 in chronic phase, 1 in accelerated phase, and 9 in blast phase at time of diagnosis. Conventional cytogenetics analysis showed a normal karyotype (n = 19); abnormal karyotype with morphologically normal chromosomes 9 and 22 (n = 5); apparent ins(9;22) (n = 2) and abnormal karyotype with apparent abnormal chromosomes 9, der(9) and/or 22, der(22) (n = 15). The locations of insertion-derived BCR-ABL1 were identified on chromosome 22 (68.3%), 9 (29.3%), and 19 (2.4%). Complex chromosomal abnormalities were often overlooked by conventional cytogenetics but identified by FISH tests in many cases. After a median follow-up of 58 months (range 1-242 months), 11 patients died, and 3 lost contact, while the others achieved different cytogenetic/molecular responses. The locations of BCR-ABL1 (der(22) vs. non-der(22)) and the karyotype results (complex karyotype vs. noncomplex karyotype) by conventional cytogenetics were not associated with overall survival in this cohort. However, redefining the complexity of chromosomal abnormality by correlating karyotype and FISH findings, CML cases with simple chromosomal abnormalities had a more favorable overall survival than that with complex chromosomal abnormalities. We conclude that insertion-derived BCR-ABL1 fusions often involve complex chromosomal abnormalities which are overlooked by conventional cytogenetics, but can be identified by one or more FISH tests. We also suggest that the traditional cytogenetic response criteria may not apply in these patients, and the complexity of chromosomal abnormalities redefined by correlating karyotype and FISH findings can plays a role in stratifying patients into more suitable risk groups for predicting prognosis.

However, current methods still require advanced equipment or entail substantial waste of reagents. Here, we introduce magnetic bead-assisted parallel single-cell gene expression sequencing (MAPS-seq), a microwell-based method that pools samples before the reverse transcription step, increasing the ease of sample preparation and reducing reagent waste. Moreover, because this method uses universal reagents and standard molecular biology lab instruments, it is easy to implement, even in labs that have not previously conducted single-cell RNA sequencing. We validated our method by demonstrating that it can generate gene expression data at the single-cell level. We then applied the MAPS-seq method to analyze 237 human myelogenous leukemia cells treated with one of three different drugs or dimethyl sulfoxide. We observed transcriptional changes and identified marker genes that indicate a drug response. Furthermore, the MAPS-seq method produced data of comparable quality to those of existing single-cell RNA sequencing methods. Consequently, we expect that our method will provide researchers with a more accessible, less wasteful, and less burdensome method for investigating the transcriptomes of individual cells.","['Park, Munsu', 'Lee, Dongin', 'Bang, Duhee', 'Lee, Ji Hyun']","['Park M', 'Lee D', 'Bang D', 'Lee JH']","['Department of Biomedical Science and Technology, Graduate School, Kyung Hee University, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Chemistry, Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Chemistry, Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea. duheebang@yonsei.ac.kr.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics, College of Medicine, Kyung Hee University, Seoul, Korea. hyunihyuni@khu.ac.kr.', 'Department of Biomedical Science and Technology, Kyung Hee Medical Science Research Institute, Kyung Hee University, Seoul, Korea. hyunihyuni@khu.ac.kr.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200513,United States,Exp Mol Med,Experimental & molecular medicine,9607880,,IM,"['Cell Line', 'Drug Discovery', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Gene Expression Profiling/*methods', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing/*methods', 'Humans', '*Magnetic Iron Oxide Nanoparticles', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sequence Analysis, RNA/methods', 'Single-Cell Analysis/*methods', '*Transcriptome']",PMC7272464,,,2020/05/15 06:00,2021/07/31 06:00,['2020/05/15 06:00'],"['2019/12/30 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/06 00:00 [revised]', '2020/05/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/31 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/15 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s12276-020-0433-x [doi]', '10.1038/s12276-020-0433-x [pii]']",ppublish,Exp Mol Med. 2020 May;52(5):804-814. doi: 10.1038/s12276-020-0433-x.

However, whether this has translated into greater long-term survival is unknown. Here, we examine 10- and 20-year survival for patients with multiple myeloma (MM), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML), chronic lymphoid leukemia (CLL), chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), and Hodgkin lymphoma (HL). Data were extracted from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-9 database. Patients age 15+ with the above malignancies were included. The newly developed boomerang method was used to examine 10- and 20-year relative survival (RS) for patients in 2002-2006 and 2012-16. Ten and 20-year RS increased for each malignancy examined, with increases ranging from +4.4% units for 20-year RS for AML to +23.1% units for 10-year RS for CML. Ten year RS was >50% in 2012-16 for patients with CLL, CML, HL, NHL, and DLBCL, at 77.1%, 62.1%, 63.9%, 64.5%, and 63.0%, respectively. Survival dropped between 10 and 20 years after diagnosis for most malignancies. Long-term survival is increasing for common hematologic malignancies, but late mortality is an ongoing issue. Further study of long-term outcomes in curable malignancies to determine the reason for these later decreases in survival is indicated.","['Pulte, Dianne', 'Jansen, Lina', 'Brenner, Hermann']","['Pulte D', 'Jansen L', 'Brenner H']","['Division of Clinical Epidemiology and Aging Research, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany. pultedi@gmail.com.', 'Division of Clinical Epidemiology and Aging Research, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Division of Clinical Epidemiology and Aging Research, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Division of Preventive Oncology, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) and National Center for Tumor Diseases (NCT), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],['108257/Deutsche Krebshilfe (German Cancer Aid)/International'],['Journal Article'],20200513,United States,Blood Cancer J,Blood cancer journal,101568469,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Epidemiological Monitoring', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/diagnosis/*epidemiology', 'Hodgkin Disease/diagnosis/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/diagnosis/epidemiology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diagnosis/epidemiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/epidemiology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/diagnosis/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/diagnosis/epidemiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/epidemiology', 'Survival Analysis', 'Survival Rate', 'Young Adult']",PMC7221083,,,2020/05/15 06:00,2021/05/05 06:00,['2020/05/15 06:00'],"['2019/08/02 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/29 00:00 [revised]', '2020/05/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/05/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/05 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41408-020-0323-4 [doi]', '10.1038/s41408-020-0323-4 [pii]']",epublish,Blood Cancer J. 2020 May 13;10(5):56. doi: 10.1038/s41408-020-0323-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The authors evaluated the appropriateness of antibiotics for the empiric treatment of FN in pediatric patients with cancer in our institution on the basis of changes in the epidemiology of organisms isolated from blood cultures (BCx). METHODS: The authors conducted a retrospective medical record review of pediatric patients who received any oncology care (including patients with cancer and patients who had stem cell transplant) at University of Chicago Medicine Comer Children's Hospitals (March 2009 to December 2016) with a diagnosis of FN who had at least 1 BCx obtained. They reviewed pathogens isolated from BCx and determined whether they were pathogens or contaminants using the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines and the team's decision to treat. They investigated the microbiologic spectrum and susceptibility patterns of pathogens causing bacteremia in pediatric FN and whether the empiric therapy chosen may have affected clinical outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 667 FN episodes were identified in 268 patients. BCx were negative in 497 (74.5%) and were determined to be contaminants in 27 (4%). In 143 episodes (21.5%), the BCx were positive for a pathogenic species. Polymicrobial bacteremia was identified in 25 episodes; a total of 176 pathogens were isolated. The majority of pathogens (95/176, 54%) were Gram-positive (GP), whereas 64 of 162 (36%) were Gram-negative (GN), 5 were fungal, and 4 were mycobacterial. The most common GP pathogens were viridans group streptococci (VGS) (n=34, 19.3%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (n=25, 14%), and methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (n=12, 6.8%). Of aerobic GN bacilli, 15 (8.5%) were AmpC producers and 3 (1.7%) carried extended-spectrum beta-lactamases. There was no increase in the prevalence of multidrug-resistant GN isolates during the study period. Patients with VGS and multidrug-resistant GN bacteremia were more likely to be admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit [odds ratio (OR), 3.24; P=0.017; and OR, 2.8; P=0.07, respectively]. There were trends toward a higher prevalence of GP pathogens causing bacteremia and the emergence of VGS with decreased penicillin sensitivity. The prevalence of bacteremia with VGS was higher in acute myelogenous leukemia and neuroblastoma (OR, 2.3; P<0.01) than in patients with other solid tumors. CONCLUSIONS: Empiric antibiotic treatment should be tailored to patients' risk for VGS and multidrug-resistant organisms. Individual hospitals should monitor the pathogens causing FN among patients with cancer to guide choice of empiric therapy.","['Alali, Muayad', 'David, Michael Z', 'Danziger-Isakov, Lara A', 'Elmuti, Lena', 'Bhagat, Palak H', 'Bartlett, Allison H']","['Alali M', 'David MZ', 'Danziger-Isakov LA', 'Elmuti L', 'Bhagat PH', 'Bartlett AH']","['Department of Pediatrics, Division of Infectious Diseases.', 'Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA.', ""Department of Pediatrics, Division of Pediatric Infectious Diseases, University of Cincinnati, Immunocompromised Host Infectious Disease, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH."", 'Pediatrics.', 'Pharmacy, University of Chicago Medicine, Chicago, IL.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Division of Infectious Diseases.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Bacteremia/*drug therapy/etiology/pathology', 'Bacteria/drug effects/*isolation & purification', 'Blood Culture/*methods', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Febrile Neutropenia/*drug therapy/etiology/pathology', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Microbial Sensitivity Tests', 'Neoplasms/*complications/pathology/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Young Adult']",,,,2020/05/15 06:00,2021/01/01 06:00,['2020/05/15 06:00'],"['2020/05/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/01 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/15 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/MPH.0000000000001814 [doi]', '00043426-202008000-00019 [pii]']",ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2020 Aug;42(6):e445-e451. doi: 10.1097/MPH.0000000000001814.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The patient had no coagulopathy and normal karyotype, and showed excellent response to initial treatment in terms of complete remission and negative minimal residual disease after standard-risk induction chemotherapy.

The symptom clusters (SCs) as well as subsets of concurrent symptoms in AL patients have not yet been demonstrated. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the SCs of adult AL patients who were receiving chemotherapy and to determine their correlations with functional performance. METHODS: A total of 132 hospitalized adult AL patients were included in this study. A cross-sectional survey aimed to examine symptoms and functional performance was conducted. The patients' symptoms were assessed using the Chinese version of the Condensed Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale, and functional performance was evaluated through activities of daily living and quality of life. RESULTS: We identified 4 SCs in adult AL patients: psychological SC, pain-fatigue-sleep SC, dry mouth-constipation SC, and nutrition-impaired SC. The psychological SC was the most common and most distressing SC. The different SCs were each differentially correlated with patient characteristics. The distress of the psychological SC, pain-fatigue-sleep SC, and nutrition-impaired SC was adversely correlated with functional performance. CONCLUSIONS: Adult AL patients undergoing chemotherapy experience multiple symptoms that can be further categorized into 4 SCs. The distress from some SCs is negatively associated with patients' functional performance. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Symptom burden remains a major problem for adult AL patients undergoing chemotherapy. Identifying SCs of AL patients should be the basis for accurate and cost-effective interventions. Personalized SC management may improve the functional performance and healthcare quality of adult AL patients.","['Chen, Fengjiao', 'Leng, Yamei', 'Zhang, Li', 'Xu, Juan', 'Zhang, Dan', 'Qin, Yu', 'Li, Jiping', 'Zheng, Yuhuan']","['Chen F', 'Leng Y', 'Zhang L', 'Xu J', 'Zhang D', 'Qin Y', 'Li J', 'Zheng Y']","['Author Affiliations: West China School of Nursing (Mrs Chen and Li) and Departments of Hematology (Mrs Chen, Leng, Zhang, Xu, Zhang, and Dr Zheng) and Nursing (Mrs Li), West China Hospital, Sichuan University; and Department of Endocrinology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas (Dr Qin).']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,Cancer Nurs,Cancer nursing,7805358,,IM,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Adult', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Physical Functional Performance', '*Quality of Life', 'Syndrome']",,,,2020/05/15 06:00,2021/11/26 06:00,['2020/05/15 06:00'],"['2020/05/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/26 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/15 06:00 [entrez]']","['00002820-202109000-00012 [pii]', '10.1097/NCC.0000000000000816 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Nurs. 2021 Sep-Oct 01;44(5):E287-E295. doi: 10.1097/NCC.0000000000000816.,,['The authors have no conflicts of interest to disclose.'],"['Copyright (c) 2020 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Genomic and molecular risk factors in CLL patients determine the individual risk for disease progression and response to therapy, and can impact survival. In this review article, we discuss current treatment strategies for CLL patients in Japan, where the novel targeted agents, the BTK inhibitor ibrutinib and BCL2 antagonist venetoclax, now are available and increasingly used in clinical practice. We also discuss the importance of CLL risk factors for making therapy decisions, focusing on immunoglobulin variable region heavy chain (IGHV) mutation status, 11q deletion, and 17p deletion. Treatment approaches for CLL have rapidly changed in the past few years because of these new targeted agents. They are highly effective, well tolerated, and have been demonstrated in a series of large randomized clinical trials to improve survival when compared with conventional chemotherapy-based treatment. Therefore, for most patients, especially high-risk CLL patients, BTK inhibitor and BCL2 antagonist therapies are preferred over chemo-immunotherapy. Currently ongoing studies seek to determine the best sequence for these new agents and whether a combination therapy approach is beneficial. With these developments, a new era of chemotherapy-free treatment for CLL patients is expected.","['Kojima, Kensuke', 'Burger, Jan A']","['Kojima K', 'Burger JA']","['Department of Hematology, Kochi Medical School, Kochi University, Nankoku, Kochi, Japan.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200513,Japan,J Clin Exp Hematop,Journal of clinical and experimental hematopathology : JCEH,101141257,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', 'Chromosome 17 deletion']",IM,"['*Algorithms', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11/genetics/metabolism', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics/metabolism', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', '*Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Smith-Magenis Syndrome', 'Survival Rate']",PMC7810251,['NOTNLM'],"['17p deletion', 'Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)', 'TP53 mutation', 'ibrutinib', 'venetoclax']",2020/05/15 06:00,2021/02/05 06:00,['2020/05/15 06:00'],"['2020/05/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/05 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/15 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.3960/jslrt.20002 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Exp Hematop. 2020 Dec 15;60(4):130-137. doi: 10.3960/jslrt.20002.

Currently, in situ diagnosis is determined through anamnesis, evaluation of the history, and perception of the clinical signs of the herd. There is no practical and noninvasive test adapted to a large number of samples, which represents a gap for the use of new approaches that provide information about infections and the risks of herds. Here, we performed a search in the Neospora caninum genome by linear B-cell epitopes using immunoinformatic tools aiming to develop a chimeric protein with high potential to bind specifically to antibodies from infected cattle samples. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with the new chimeric antigen was developed and tested with sera from natural field N. caninum-infected bovines. The cross-reactivity of the new antigen was also evaluated using sera from bovines infected by other abortive pathogens, including Trypanosoma vivax, Leptospira sp., Mycobacterium bovis, and Brucella abortus, and enzootic bovine leucosis caused by bovine leukemia virus, as well as with samples of animals infected with Toxoplasma gondii The assay using the chimeric protein showed 96.6% +/- 3.4% of sensitivity in comparison to healthy animal sera. Meanwhile, in relation to false-positive results provided by cross-reactivity with others pathogens, the specificity value was 97.0% +/- 2.9%. In conclusion, immunoinformatic tools provide an efficient platform to build an accurate protein to diagnose bovine neosporosis based on serum samples.","['Pereira, Higor Sette', 'E Almeida, Ludmila Tavares', 'Fernandes, Vitoria', 'Senra, Renato Lima', 'Fontes, Patricia Pereira', 'Bittar, Eustaquio Resende', 'Ribon, Andrea de Oliveira Barros', 'Rotta, Polyana Pizzi', 'Menezes-Souza, Daniel', 'Bittar, Joely Ferreira Figueiredo', 'Mendes, Tiago Antonio de Oliveira']","['Pereira HS', 'E Almeida LT', 'Fernandes V', 'Senra RL', 'Fontes PP', 'Bittar ER', 'Ribon AOB', 'Rotta PP', 'Menezes-Souza D', 'Bittar JFF', 'Mendes TAO']","['Departamento de Bioquimica e Biologia Molecular, Universidade Federal de Vicosa, Vicosa, Minas Gerais, Brazil.', 'Departamento de Medicina Veterinaria, Universidade Federal de Vicosa, Vicosa, Minas Gerais, Brazil.', 'Departamento de Medicina Veterinaria, Universidade Federal de Vicosa, Vicosa, Minas Gerais, Brazil.', 'Departamento de Bioquimica e Biologia Molecular, Universidade Federal de Vicosa, Vicosa, Minas Gerais, Brazil.', 'Departamento de Bioquimica e Biologia Molecular, Universidade Federal de Vicosa, Vicosa, Minas Gerais, Brazil.', 'Programa de Pos-Graduacao em Sanidade e Producao Animal nos Tropicos, Universidade de Uberaba, Uberaba, Minas Gerais, Brazil.', 'Departamento de Bioquimica e Biologia Molecular, Universidade Federal de Vicosa, Vicosa, Minas Gerais, Brazil.', 'Departamento de Zootecnia, Universidade Federal de Vicosa, Vicosa, Minas Gerais, Brazil.', 'Departamento de Patologia Clinica, COLTEC, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil.', 'Programa de Pos-Graduacao em Ciencias da Saude: Infectologia e Medicina Tropical, Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil.', 'Programa de Pos-Graduacao em Sanidade e Producao Animal nos Tropicos, Universidade de Uberaba, Uberaba, Minas Gerais, Brazil.', 'Departamento de Bioquimica e Biologia Molecular, Universidade Federal de Vicosa, Vicosa, Minas Gerais, Brazil tiagoaomendes@ufv.br.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200624,United States,J Clin Microbiol,Journal of clinical microbiology,7505564,"['0 (Antibodies, Protozoan)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Protozoan', 'Cattle', '*Cattle Diseases/diagnosis', '*Coccidiosis/diagnosis/veterinary', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', '*Neospora/genetics', 'Pregnancy', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics', 'Serologic Tests']",PMC7315025,['NOTNLM'],"['*Neospora caninum', '*chimeric protein', '*immunoinformatics', '*serodiagnosis']",2020/05/15 06:00,2021/06/24 06:00,['2020/05/15 06:00'],"['2019/08/26 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/24 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/15 06:00 [entrez]']","['JCM.01343-19 [pii]', '10.1128/JCM.01343-19 [doi]']",epublish,J Clin Microbiol. 2020 Jun 24;58(7). pii: JCM.01343-19. doi: 10.1128/JCM.01343-19.

We previously reported that FAK inhibition by the selective inhibitor VS-4718 exerted antileukemia activities in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The mechanisms involved, and whether VS-4718 potentiates efficacy of other therapeutic agents, have not been investigated. Resistance to apoptosis inducted by the BCL-2 inhibitor ABT-199 (venetoclax) in AML is mediated by preexisting and ABT-199-induced overexpression of MCL-1 and BCL-XL. We observed that VS-4718 or silencing FAK with siRNA decreased MCL-1 and BCL-XL levels. Importantly, VS-4718 antagonized ABT-199-induced MCL-1 and BCL-XL. VS-4718 markedly synergized with ABT-199 to induce apoptosis in AML cells, including primary AML CD34(+) cells and AML cells overexpressing MCL-1 or BCL-XL. In a patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model derived from a patient sample with NPM1/FLT3-ITD/TET2/DNMT3A/WT1 mutations and complex karyotype, VS-4718 statistically significantly reduced leukemia tissue infiltration and extended survival (72 vs. control 36 days, P = 0.0002), and only its combination with ABT-199 effectively decreased systemic leukemia tissue infiltration and circulating blasts, and prolonged survival (65.5 vs. control 36 days, P = 0.0119). Furthermore, the combination decreased NFkappaB signaling and induced the expression of IFN genes in vivo The combination also markedly extended survival of a second PDX model developed from an aggressive, TP53-mutated complex karyotype AML sample. The data suggest that the combined inhibition of FAK and BCL-2 enhances antileukemia activity in AML at least in part by suppressing MCL-1 and BCL-XL and that this combination may be effective in AML with TP53 and other mutations, and thus benefit patients with high-risk AML.","['Wang, Xiangmeng', 'Mak, Po Yee', 'Mu, Hong', 'Tao, Wenjing', 'Rao, Arvind', 'Visweswaran, Ravikumar', 'Ruvolo, Vivian', 'Pachter, Jonathan A', 'Weaver, David T', 'Andreeff, Michael', 'Xu, Bing', 'Carter, Bing Z']","['Wang X', 'Mak PY', 'Mu H', 'Tao W', 'Rao A', 'Visweswaran R', 'Ruvolo V', 'Pachter JA', 'Weaver DT', 'Andreeff M', 'Xu B', 'Carter BZ']","['Section of Molecular Hematology and Therapy, Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, P.R.

Therefore, the suppression of radioresistance in GBM cells is of enormous significance. Ribophorin II (RPN2), a protein component of an N-oligosaccharyl transferase complex, has been associated with chemotherapy drug resistance in multiple cancers, including GBM. However, it remains unclear whether this also plays a role in radiation therapy resistance in GBM. METHODS: We conducted a bioinformatic analysis of RPN2 expression using the UCSC Cancer Genomics Browser and GEPIA database and performed an immunohistochemical assessment of RPN2 expression in biopsy specimens from 34 GBM patients who had received radiation-based therapy. We also studied the expression and function of RPN2 in radiation-resistant GBM cells. RESULTS: We found that RPN2 expression was upregulated in GBM tumors and correlated with poor survival. The expression of RPN2 was also higher in GBM patients with tumor recurrence, who were classified to be resistant to radiation therapy. In the radiation-resistant GBM cells, the expression of RPN2 was also higher than in the parental cells. Depletion of RPN2 in resistant cells can sensitize these cells to radiation-induced apoptosis, and overexpression of RPN2 had the reverse effect. Myeloid cell leukemia 1 (MCL1) was found to be the downstream target of RPN2, and contributed to radiation resistance in GBM cells. Furthermore, STAT3 was found to be the regulator of MCL1, which can be activated by RPN2 dysregulation. CONCLUSION: Our study has revealed a novel function of RPN2 in radiation-resistant GBM, and has shown that MCL1 depletion or suppression could be a promising method of therapy to overcome the resistance promoted by RPN2 dysregulation.","['Li, Changyu', 'Ran, Haonan', 'Song, Shaojun', 'Liu, Weisong', 'Zou, Wenhui', 'Jiang, Bei', 'Zhao, Hongmei', 'Shao, Bin']","['Li C', 'Ran H', 'Song S', 'Liu W', 'Zou W', 'Jiang B', 'Zhao H', 'Shao B']","['Neurosurgery, Hainan Cancer Hospital, Haikou, China.', 'Radiotherapy Department, Hainan Cancer Hospital, Haikou, China.', 'Neurosurgery, Hainan Cancer Hospital, Haikou, China.', 'Head and Neck Surgery, Hainan Cancer Hospital, Haikou, China.', 'Neurosurgery, Hainan Cancer Hospital, Haikou, China.', 'Hematology Department, Hainan Cancer Hospital, Haikou, China.', 'Clinical Pharmacy Department, Hainan Cancer Hospital, Haikou, China.', 'Neurosurgery, The First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, No.199 Dazhi Street, Nangang District, Harbin, 150001, Heilongjiang, China. oqpm0d@163.com.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200513,England,Mol Med,"Molecular medicine (Cambridge, Mass.)",9501023,"['0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.4.1.- (Hexosyltransferases)', 'EC 2.4.99.18 (RPN2 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Glioma/*genetics/*metabolism/pathology/radiotherapy', 'Hexosyltransferases/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Models, Biological', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/*genetics/metabolism', 'Radiation Tolerance/*genetics', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/*metabolism', '*Signal Transduction']",PMC7222591,['NOTNLM'],"['*GBM', '*RPN2', '*STAT3', '*Signal transduction']",2020/05/15 06:00,2021/08/10 06:00,['2020/05/15 06:00'],"['2020/03/03 00:00 [received]', '2020/04/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/05/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/10 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s10020-020-00171-5 [doi]', '10.1186/s10020-020-00171-5 [pii]']",epublish,Mol Med. 2020 May 13;26(1):43. doi: 10.1186/s10020-020-00171-5.,['ORCID: 0000-0003-0822-3463'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Lipid mediators of this system are secreted by hematopoietic cells, including the ECs 2-arachidonoyl-glycerol (2AG) and arachidonoyl-ethanolamide (AEA), the 2AG metabolite 1AG, and members of N-acylethanolamine (NAE) family-palmitoyl-ethanolamide (PEA) and oleoyl-ethanolamide (OEA). However, the relevance of the EC system in myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) was never investigated. We explored the EC plasma profile in 55 MPN patients, including myelofibrosis (MF; n = 41), polycythemia vera (PV; n = 9), and essential thrombocythemia (ET; n = 5) subclasses and in 10 healthy controls (HC). AEA, PEA, OEA, 2AG, and 1AG plasma levels were measured by LC-MS/MS. Overall considered, MPN patients displayed similar EC and NAE levels compared to HC. Nonetheless, AEA levels in MPN were directly associated with the platelet count. MF patients showed higher levels of the sum of 2AG and 1AG compared to ET and PV patients, higher OEA/AEA ratios compared to HC and ET patients, and higher OEA/PEA ratios compared to HC. Furthermore, the sum of 2AG and 1AG positively correlated with JAK2(V617F) variant allele frequency and splenomegaly in MF and was elevated in high-risk PV patients compared to in low-risk PV patients.

Despite recent clinical revolutions in adoptive T-cell transfer approaches and immune checkpoint blockade, tumor microenvironment is a major obstacle to tumor regression in B-cell malignancies. A transcriptional alteration of coding and non-coding RNAs, such as microRNAs (miRNAs), has been widely demonstrated in the tumor microenvironment of B-cell malignancies. MiRNAs have been associated with different clinical-biological forms of B-cell malignancies and involved in the regulation of B lymphocyte development, maturation, and function, including B-cell activation and malignant transformation. Additionally, tumor-secreted extracellular vesicles regulate recipient cell functions in the tumor microenvironment to facilitate metastasis and progression by delivering miRNA contents to neighboring cells. Herein, we focus on the interplay between miRNAs and tumor microenvironment components in the different B-cell malignancies and its impact on diagnosis, proliferation, and involvement in treatment resistance.","['El-Daly, Sherien M', 'Bayraktar, Recep', 'Anfossi, Simone', 'Calin, George A']","['El-Daly SM', 'Bayraktar R', 'Anfossi S', 'Calin GA']","['Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.', 'Department of Medical Biochemistry, Medical Research Division, National Research Centre, Cairo 12622, Egypt.', 'Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.', 'Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.', 'Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.', 'Center for RNA Interference and Non-Coding RNAs, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030 USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],['UH3TR00943-01/NH/NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200511,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,['0 (MicroRNAs)'],IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Proliferation/genetics', 'Extracellular Vesicles/genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/diagnosis/*genetics', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Tumor Microenvironment/*genetics']",PMC7246984,['NOTNLM'],"['B-cell malignancies', 'cancer-associated fibroblasts', 'cell-to-cell communication', 'endothelial cells', 'exosomal miRNAs', 'immune cells', 'microRNAs', 'stroma', 'tumor microenvironment']",2020/05/15 06:00,2021/02/23 06:00,['2020/05/15 06:00'],"['2020/03/16 00:00 [received]', '2020/04/22 00:00 [revised]', '2020/05/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/05/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/23 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms21093387 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms21093387 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2020 May 11;21(9). pii: ijms21093387. doi: 10.3390/ijms21093387.,['ORCID: 0000-0003-0049-8606'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RFC1 expression is regulated by genetic variations and epigenetic modifications. The aim of the present study was to investigate the methylation status of the SLC19A1 promoter in peripheral blood and its association with MTX levels and toxicities in children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). METHODS: Serum MTX concentrations were measured using a fluorescence polarization immunoassay. Methylation quantification for SLC19A1 promoter region #17 was performed by Sequenom MassARRAY in 52 paediatric ALL patients. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Overall, the investigated region of the SLC19A1 promoter was in a hypermethylated state. No significant associations were detected between the methylation levels of six CpG units in the SLC19A1 promoter region #17 and clinical parameters of patients with ALL, including sex, age, immunotype and risk stratification. The methylation level of CpG_10 showed a significant positive correlation with MTX 24 hours after the initiation of infusion. No significant differences in the methylation levels of six CpG units were observed between patients with and without MTX toxicities. Due to the small sample size of this study, there was a high chance of false-positive results. A large-scale study would be required to confirm these preliminary results. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: Our preliminary results suggested the hypermethylated status of the SLC19A1 promoter in children with ALL. The methylation levels of the SLC19A1 promoter might affect MTX exposure. These findings have implications for the mechanisms underlying the variability of MTX responses in childhood ALL.","['Wang, Shu-Mei', 'Li, Miao', 'Wu, Wan-Shui', 'Sun, Lu-Lu', 'Yan, Dan']","['Wang SM', 'Li M', 'Wu WS', 'Sun LL', 'Yan D']","['Department of Pharmacy, Beijing Shijitan Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.', 'Beijing Key Laboratory of Bio-Characteristic Profiling for Evaluation of Rational Drug Use, Beijing, China.', 'International Cooperation & Joint Laboratory of Bio-Characteristic Profiling for Evaluation of Rational Drug Use, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Beijing Shijitan Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Beijing Shijitan Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Beijing Shijitan Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Beijing Shijitan Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.', 'Beijing Key Laboratory of Bio-Characteristic Profiling for Evaluation of Rational Drug Use, Beijing, China.', 'International Cooperation & Joint Laboratory of Bio-Characteristic Profiling for Evaluation of Rational Drug Use, Beijing, China.']",['eng'],"[""QML20160703/Beijing Municipal Administration of Hospitals' Youth Programme"", '2017-c01/Science and Technology Fund of Beijing Shijitan Hospital', '81872926/National Natural Science Foundation of China', '81503135/National Natural Science Foundation of China']",['Journal Article'],20200513,England,J Clin Pharm Ther,Journal of clinical pharmacy and therapeutics,8704308,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Reduced Folate Carrier Protein)', '0 (SLC19A1 protein, human)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/therapeutic use', 'Asians/*genetics', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/therapeutic use', 'Methylation', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/*genetics', 'Reduced Folate Carrier Protein/*genetics']",,['NOTNLM'],"['acute lymphoblastic leukaemia', 'genetic polymorphisms', 'methotrexate', 'methylation', 'reduced folate carrier 1']",2020/05/14 06:00,2021/02/09 06:00,['2020/05/14 06:00'],"['2020/02/10 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/18 00:00 [revised]', '2020/04/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/09 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/14 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/jcpt.13171 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Pharm Ther. 2020 Aug;45(4):646-651. doi: 10.1111/jcpt.13171.

Linezolid is an appropriate choice for these patients when coverage of positive bacteria is needed. An important side effect of linezolid is linezolid-induced thrombocytopenia; so, the safety of linezolid for AML patients in myelosuppression is of concern. No study has focused on platelets in these patients. METHODS: We reviewed 1356 AML patients who received consolidation chemotherapy in our hospital during January 2009 and June 2019. Among them, 36 patients were treated with linezolid and 41 with vancomycin. We counted the days of platelet count <20*10E9/L, <50*10E9/L, the lowest platelet count, total quantity of platelet transfusion and clinical bleeding events of these patients, to evaluate the safety of linezolid during myelosuppression in AML patients. RESULTS: The days of platelet count <20*10E9/L in the linezolid group and vancomycin group were 6.2 +/- 2.5 days and 6.7 +/- 2.9 days, and the days of platelet count <50*10E9/L in the linezolid group and vancomycin group were 10.9 +/- 3.6 days and 11.7 +/- 4.0 days, respectively; there was no significant difference between the two groups. No life-threatening severe bleeding events occurred in either group. CONCLUSION: This retrospective clinical study suggests that it is safe to manage AML patients in complete remission during myelosuppression after standard consolidation chemotherapy with idarubicin and cytarabine, with about 7 days of linezolid therapy.","['Zhou, De', 'Shi, Ting', 'Zhao, Shuqi', 'Zhu, Jingjing', 'Zhu, Lixia', 'Yang, Xiudi', 'Xie, Wanzhuo', 'Ye, Xiujin']","['Zhou', 'Shi T', 'Zhao S', 'Zhu J', 'Zhu L', 'Yang X', 'Xie W', 'Ye X']","['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University College of Medicine, Hangzhou, P.R.

We performed molecular dynamics simulations and docking of curcumin derivatives into the Pgp model. Based on these calculations, a series of pyrazolocurcumin derivatives with predicted metabolic stability and/or improved binding affinity were proposed for synthesis and evaluation of MDR reversal potency against Dox selected K562/4 subline, a derivative of K562 human chronic myelogenous leukemia cell line. Compounds 16 and 19 which are both dimethylcurcumin pyrazole derivatives bearing an N-p-phenylcarboxylic amide substitution, were the most potent Pgp blockers as determined by intracellular Dox accumulation.

Our previous study found that soy-whey blended protein (SWP) can improve muscle mass in acute leukemia patients. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to explore potential factors that influence muscle outcomes after nutritional intervention. METHODS: In this case-control study, 13 patients who received HSCT and failed to improve muscle function within half a year were included. After two months of SWP intervention, the subjects were divided into two groups (MSI: muscle status improved; MNI: muscle status not improved). 16S rDNA sequencing, principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) and the PICRUSt algorithm were used to analyze the composition, structure and function of the intestinal microbiota between the groups. This study was registered in the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR 1800017765). RESULTS: SWP significantly improved muscle status (muscle area: from 330.4 mm(2) to 384.8 mm(2), p = 0.02; muscle strength: from 19.2 kg to 21.3 kg, p = 0.04). However, there were a small number of subjects whose muscle status was not effectively improved. After SWP intervention, the diversity (Shannon: from 1.7 to 3.8, p = 0.01; Simpson: from 0.6 to 0.8, p = 0.015) of the intestinal microbiota in the MSI group increased significantly, whereas that in the MNI group did not. Principal component analysis (PCA) revealed separate groupings of the microbiota of the Baseline-MSI and Endpoint-MSI time points in the MSI group. Opposite patterns of microbial abundance change were found between the MSI group (75% of changed genera were increased) and the MNI group (80% of changed genera were decreased). Three bacterial taxa (negative correlation: Streptococcus; positive correlations: Ruminococcus and Veillonella) were significantly related to muscle improvement outcomes. Both pentose phosphate (p = 0.048) and amino acid biosynthesis (p = 0.039), which are related to muscle metabolism, were found to be significantly changed in the MSI group through PICRUSt algorithm prediction. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the intestinal microbiota plays important roles in the regulation of muscle metabolism.","['Ren, Guangxu', 'Zhang, Jianping', 'Li, Minghua', 'Tang, Zhenchuang', 'Yang, Zhenni', 'Cheng, Guangyan', 'Wang, Jiaqi']","['Ren G', 'Zhang J', 'Li M', 'Tang Z', 'Yang Z', 'Cheng G', 'Wang J']","[""Institute of Food and Nutrition Development, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs of the People's Republic of China, Beijing, China.

It is more frequent in immunocompromised patients with multiple comorbidities, which make their management more difficult. The aim of this study is to describe a cohort of patients operated due to AIFRS, their clinical characteristics, mortality, aetiological agent and efficacy of diagnostic tests. MATERIAL AND METHOD: Non-concurrent prospective study of patients with AIFRS who were operated between 2005 and 2015 in our centre. RESULTS: Thirty-two patients were included, 62.5% (20/32) men, with an average age of 39.4 years (16-65 years). Overall mortality was 71.9%; acute mortality 46.9% and late mortality 25%. Haematological malignancies were the most common underlying disease, present in 84.4% (27/32) of cases, followed by diabetes mellitus in 9.4% (3/32). On diagnosis, 62.5% (20/32) of patients were neutropenic, 80% (16/20) of them with febrile neutropenia. Fever was the most frequent symptom, present in 65.6% (21/32) of patients, followed by facial pain or headache in 53.1% (17/32). Aspergillus was identified in 37.5% (12/32) of cases and Rhizopus in 31.3% (10/32). There was no association between the analysed variables and increased risk of mortality. CONCLUSIONS: AIFRS is an aggressive disease with a high mortality rate, therefore a timely diagnosis is fundamental. It is necessary to optimise suspicion criteria for an early diagnosis in order to improve the prognosis.","['Lagos, Antonia', 'Ferrada, Sergio', 'Munoz, Tamara', 'Maul, Ximena', 'Finkelstein, Andres', 'Gonzalez, Claudia', 'Fonseca, Ximena', 'Callejas, Claudio']","['Lagos A', 'Ferrada S', 'Munoz T', 'Maul X', 'Finkelstein A', 'Gonzalez C', 'Fonseca X', 'Callejas C']","['Departamento de Otorrinolaringologia, Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile, Santiago, Chile.', 'Departamento de Otorrinolaringologia, Hospital Regional de Temuco, Temuco, Chile.', 'Departamento de Otorrinolaringologia, Hospital del Salvador, Universidad de Chile, Santiago, Chile.', 'Departamento de Otorrinolaringologia, Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile, Santiago, Chile.', 'Departamento de Otorrinolaringologia, Clinica Alemana de Santiago, Santiago, Chile.', 'Departamento de Otorrinolaringologia, Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile, Santiago, Chile.', 'Departamento de Otorrinolaringologia, Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile, Santiago, Chile.', 'Departamento de Otorrinolaringologia, Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile, Santiago, Chile.

The commercial CVI988/Rispens vaccine was used to vaccinate the crossbred offspring at 1-day-old. At 7-days-old, the birds were inoculated with the inactivated oil-emulsion vaccines (OEVs) AIV-H5 monovalent and NDV + AIV-H9 bivalent, respectively. Then the birds were challenged with a Chinese very virulent (vv) MDV field strain GXY2 at 14-day-old. The results showed that the viral load of the challenged GXY2 in the offspring from the ALV-J positive breeders was significantly higher than that from the ALV-negative breeders' (P < 0.05), and the mortality and tumor incidence of offspring from the ALV-J positive breeders were higher than those of the ALV-negative breeders. Also the offspring of the ALV-J positive breeders exhibited a significant negative effect on the development of the immune organs (P < 0.05) and lower antibody responses to the vaccinations with the commercial OEVs (P<0.05). The MD vaccine protective index in the offspring from the ALV-J positive breeders was lower than that from the ALV-negative breeders. The results of the study demonstrated that the vertical transmission of ALV from the ALV-J positive parents caused severe immunosuppression and significantly reduced the Marek's disease vaccine efficacy in Three-yellow chickens.","['Wang, Peikun', 'Lin, Lulu', 'Shi, Mengya', 'Li, Haijuan', 'Gu, Zhanming', 'Li, Min', 'Gao, Yanli', 'Teng, Huang', 'Mo, Meilan', 'Wei, Tianchao', 'Wei, Ping']","['Wang P', 'Lin L', 'Shi M', 'Li H', 'Gu Z', 'Li M', 'Gao Y', 'Teng H', 'Mo M', 'Wei T', 'Wei P']","['Institute for Poultry Science and Health, Guangxi University, Nanning, Guangxi 530004, China; Institute of Microbe and Host Health, Linyi University, Linyi, Shandong 276005, China.', 'Institute for Poultry Science and Health, Guangxi University, Nanning, Guangxi 530004, China.', 'Institute for Poultry Science and Health, Guangxi University, Nanning, Guangxi 530004, China.', 'Institute for Poultry Science and Health, Guangxi University, Nanning, Guangxi 530004, China.', 'Institute for Poultry Science and Health, Guangxi University, Nanning, Guangxi 530004, China.', 'Institute for Poultry Science and Health, Guangxi University, Nanning, Guangxi 530004, China.', 'Institute for Poultry Science and Health, Guangxi University, Nanning, Guangxi 530004, China.', 'Institute for Poultry Science and Health, Guangxi University, Nanning, Guangxi 530004, China.', 'Institute for Poultry Science and Health, Guangxi University, Nanning, Guangxi 530004, China.', 'Institute for Poultry Science and Health, Guangxi University, Nanning, Guangxi 530004, China.', 'Institute for Poultry Science and Health, Guangxi University, Nanning, Guangxi 530004, China.

We report that SAMHD1, a phosphohydrolase degrading deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate (dNTP), protects cells against the effects of dNTP imbalances. SAMHD1-deficient cells induce intrinsic apoptosis upon provision of deoxyribonucleosides, particularly deoxyguanosine (dG). Moreover, dG and forodesine act synergistically to kill cells lacking SAMHD1. Using mass cytometry, we find that these compounds kill SAMHD1-deficient malignant cells in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Normal cells and CLL cells from patients without SAMHD1 mutation are unaffected. We therefore propose to use forodesine as a precision medicine for leukemia, stratifying patients by SAMHD1 genotype or expression.","['Davenne, Tamara', 'Klintman, Jenny', 'Sharma, Sushma', 'Rigby, Rachel E', 'Blest, Henry T W', 'Cursi, Chiara', 'Bridgeman, Anne', 'Dadonaite, Bernadeta', 'De Keersmaecker, Kim', 'Hillmen, Peter', 'Chabes, Andrei', 'Schuh, Anna', 'Rehwinkel, Jan']","['Davenne T', 'Klintman J', 'Sharma S', 'Rigby RE', 'Blest HTW', 'Cursi C', 'Bridgeman A', 'Dadonaite B', 'De Keersmaecker K', 'Hillmen P', 'Chabes A', 'Schuh A', 'Rehwinkel J']","['Medical Research Council Human Immunology Unit, Medical Research Council Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, Radcliffe Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford OX3 9DS, UK; Laboratory for Disease Mechanisms in Cancer, Department of Oncology, KU Leuven and Leuven Cancer Institute (LKI), Herestraat 49, 3000 Leuven, Belgium.', 'Molecular Diagnostic Centre, Department of Oncology, University of Oxford, Oxford OX3 7DQ, UK.', 'Department of Medical Biochemistry and Biophysics and Laboratory for Molecular Infection Medicine Sweden (MIMS), Umea University, 901 87 Umea, Sweden.', 'Medical Research Council Human Immunology Unit, Medical Research Council Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, Radcliffe Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford OX3 9DS, UK.', 'Medical Research Council Human Immunology Unit, Medical Research Council Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, Radcliffe Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford OX3 9DS, UK.', 'Medical Research Council Human Immunology Unit, Medical Research Council Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, Radcliffe Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford OX3 9DS, UK.', 'Medical Research Council Human Immunology Unit, Medical Research Council Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, Radcliffe Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford OX3 9DS, UK.', 'Sir William Dunn School of Pathology, University of Oxford, South Parks Road, Oxford OX1 3RE, UK.', 'Laboratory for Disease Mechanisms in Cancer, Department of Oncology, KU Leuven and Leuven Cancer Institute (LKI), Herestraat 49, 3000 Leuven, Belgium.', ""St James' Institute of Oncology, St James' University Hospital, Leeds LS9 7TF, UK."", 'Department of Medical Biochemistry and Biophysics and Laboratory for Molecular Infection Medicine Sweden (MIMS), Umea University, 901 87 Umea, Sweden.', 'Molecular Diagnostic Centre, Department of Oncology, University of Oxford, Oxford OX3 7DQ, UK; Department of Oncology, Old Road Campus Research Building, University of Oxford, Oxford OX3 7DQ, UK; Department of Haematology, Oxford University Hospitals NHS Trust, Oxford OX3 7JL, UK.', 'Medical Research Council Human Immunology Unit, Medical Research Council Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, Radcliffe Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford OX3 9DS, UK.

However, the underlying mechanisms by which these m(6)A modifiers are regulated remain elusive. Here we show that expression of m(6)A demethylase ALKBH5 is regulated by chromatin state alteration during leukemogenesis of human acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and ALKBH5 is required for maintaining leukemia stem cell (LSC) function but is dispensable for normal hematopoiesis. Mechanistically, KDM4C regulates ALKBH5 expression via increasing chromatin accessibility of ALKBH5 locus, by reducing H3K9me3 levels and promoting recruitment of MYB and Pol II. Moreover, ALKBH5 affects mRNA stability of receptor tyrosine kinase AXL in an m(6)A-dependent way. Thus, our findings link chromatin state dynamics with expression regulation of m(6)A modifiers and uncover a selective and critical role of ALKBH5 in AML that might act as a therapeutic target of specific targeting LSCs.","['Wang, Jiazhen', 'Li, Yicun', 'Wang, Peipei', 'Han, Guoqiang', 'Zhang, Tiantian', 'Chang, Jiwei', 'Yin, Rong', 'Shan, Yi', 'Wen, Jin', 'Xie, Xueqin', 'Feng, Mengdie', 'Wang, Qifan', 'Hu, Jin', 'Cheng, Ying', 'Zhang, Tong', 'Li, Yashu', 'Gao, Zhuying', 'Guo, Chengli', 'Wang, Jing', 'Liang, Jianfei', 'Cui, Manman', 'Gao, Kexin', 'Chai, Jihua', 'Liu, Weidong', 'Cheng, Hui', 'Li, Lei', 'Zhou, Fuling', 'Liu, Lingbo', 'Luo, Yi', 'Li, Shaoguang', 'Zhang, Haojian']","['Wang J', 'Li Y', 'Wang P', 'Han G', 'Zhang T', 'Chang J', 'Yin R', 'Shan Y', 'Wen J', 'Xie X', 'Feng M', 'Wang Q', 'Hu J', 'Cheng Y', 'Zhang T', 'Li Y', 'Gao Z', 'Guo C', 'Wang J', 'Liang J', 'Cui M', 'Gao K', 'Chai J', 'Liu W', 'Cheng H', 'Li L', 'Zhou F', 'Liu L', 'Luo Y', 'Li S', 'Zhang H']","['The State Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Basic Science of Stomatology & Key Laboratory of Oral Biomedicine Ministry of Education, School & Hospital of Stomatology, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China;

As an m(6)A demethylase, ALKBH5 has been shown to promote the development of breast cancer and brain tumors. However, in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), ALKBH5 was reported to be frequently deleted, implying a tumor-suppressor role. Here, we show that ALKBH5 deletion is rare in human AML; instead, ALKBH5 is aberrantly overexpressed in AML. Moreover, its increased expression correlates with poor prognosis in AML patients. We demonstrate that ALKBH5 is required for the development and maintenance of AML and self-renewal of leukemia stem/initiating cells (LSCs/LICs) but not essential for normal hematopoiesis. Mechanistically, ALKBH5 exerts tumor-promoting effects in AML by post-transcriptional regulation of its critical targets such as TACC3, a prognosis-associated oncogene in various cancers. Collectively, our findings reveal crucial functions of ALKBH5 in leukemogenesis and LSC/LIC self-renewal/maintenance and highlight the therapeutic potential of targeting the ALKBH5/m(6)A axis.","['Shen, Chao', 'Sheng, Yue', 'Zhu, Allen C', 'Robinson, Sean', 'Jiang, Xi', 'Dong, Lei', 'Chen, Huiying', 'Su, Rui', 'Yin, Zhe', 'Li, Wei', 'Deng, Xiaolan', 'Chen, Yinhuai', 'Hu, Yueh-Chiang', 'Weng, Hengyou', 'Huang, Huilin', 'Prince, Emily', 'Cogle, Christopher R', 'Sun, Miao', 'Zhang, Bin', 'Chen, Chun-Wei', 'Marcucci, Guido', 'He, Chuan', 'Qian, Zhijian', 'Chen, Jianjun']","['Shen C', 'Sheng Y', 'Zhu AC', 'Robinson S', 'Jiang X', 'Dong L', 'Chen H', 'Su R', 'Yin Z', 'Li W', 'Deng X', 'Chen Y', 'Hu YC', 'Weng H', 'Huang H', 'Prince E', 'Cogle CR', 'Sun M', 'Zhang B', 'Chen CW', 'Marcucci G', 'He C', 'Qian Z', 'Chen J']","['Department of Systems Biology, Beckman Research Institute of City of Hope, Monrovia, CA 91016, USA.', 'Department of Medicine and Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL 32608, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Institute for Biophysical Dynamics, Medical Scientist Training Program/Committee on Cancer Biology, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637, USA.', 'Department of Systems Biology, Beckman Research Institute of City of Hope, Monrovia, CA 91016, USA.', 'Department of Systems Biology, Beckman Research Institute of City of Hope, Monrovia, CA 91016, USA; Department of Pharmacology, and Bone Marrow Transplantation Center of the First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Institute of Hematology, Zhejiang University, and Zhejiang Engineering Laboratory for Stem Cell and Immunotherapy, Hangzhou 310058, Zhejiang Province, China.', 'Department of Systems Biology, Beckman Research Institute of City of Hope, Monrovia, CA 91016, USA.', 'Department of Systems Biology, Beckman Research Institute of City of Hope, Monrovia, CA 91016, USA.', 'Department of Systems Biology, Beckman Research Institute of City of Hope, Monrovia, CA 91016, USA.', 'Department of Systems Biology, Beckman Research Institute of City of Hope, Monrovia, CA 91016, USA; Department of Thoracic Surgery, Chongqing Cancer Hospital, Chongqing 400030, China.', 'Department of Systems Biology, Beckman Research Institute of City of Hope, Monrovia, CA 91016, USA.', 'Department of Systems Biology, Beckman Research Institute of City of Hope, Monrovia, CA 91016, USA.', ""Transgenic Animal and Genome Editing Facility, Division of Developmental Biology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, USA; Department of Pediatrics, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH 45229, USA."", ""Transgenic Animal and Genome Editing Facility, Division of Developmental Biology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, USA; Department of Pediatrics, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH 45229, USA."", 'Department of Systems Biology, Beckman Research Institute of City of Hope, Monrovia, CA 91016, USA.', 'Department of Systems Biology, Beckman Research Institute of City of Hope, Monrovia, CA 91016, USA.', 'Department of Systems Biology, Beckman Research Institute of City of Hope, Monrovia, CA 91016, USA.', 'Department of Medicine and Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL 32608, USA.', ""Department of Pediatrics, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH 45229, USA; Division of Human Genetics, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH 45229, USA."", 'Department of Hematologic Malignancies Translational Science, Beckman Research Institute of City of Hope, Monrovia, CA 91016, USA.', 'Department of Systems Biology, Beckman Research Institute of City of Hope, Monrovia, CA 91016, USA.', 'Department of Hematologic Malignancies Translational Science, Beckman Research Institute of City of Hope, Monrovia, CA 91016, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Institute for Biophysical Dynamics, Medical Scientist Training Program/Committee on Cancer Biology, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637, USA.

METHODOLOGY: Systematic literature review, including cohort and case-control studies, without limitation of publication time, in Portuguese and English. The articles were traced from June 2017 to July 2019 in PubMed, MEDLINE, LILACS, Web of Science, and Scopus databases. The qualitative bias risk assessment was performed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and the Downs and Black Checklist. Results were presented according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). RESULTS: Seventeen studies evaluated as good/high methodological quality were eligible. Exposure to diazinon (1 cohort), phonophos (1 cohort), dichlorvos, crotoxiphos and famphur (1 case control) was associated with leukemia, while exposure to organophosphate was associated to lymphomas (6 case control); the risk of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma was higher in those exposed to diazinon (1 control case) and malathion (3 control case) than non-exposed ones. Multiple myeloma occurred more commonly in organophosphate exposed than in non-exposed individuals (1 case-control). CONCLUSION: Occupational exposure to organophosphates increases the risk of hematologic malignancies, especially among individuals with longer exposure periods. Worker monitoring and exposure control measures are recommended.","['Moura, Luiza Taciana Rodrigues de', 'Bedor, Cheila Nataly Galindo', 'Lopez, Rossana Veronica Mendoza', 'Santana, Vilma Sousa', 'Rocha, Talita Maira Bueno da Silveira da', 'Wunsch Filho, Victor', 'Curado, Maria Paula']","['Moura LTR', 'Bedor CNG', 'Lopez RVM', 'Santana VS', 'Rocha TMBDSD', 'Wunsch Filho V', 'Curado MP']","['Universidade Federal do Vale do Sao Francisco, Petrolina, PE, Brazil.', 'Universidade Federal do Vale do Sao Francisco, Petrolina, PE, Brazil.', 'Centro de Investigacao Translacional em Oncologia, Instituto do Cancer do Estado de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, SP, Brasil.', 'Programa Integrado em Saude Ambiental e do Trabalhador, Instituto de Saude Coletiva, Universidade Federal da Bahia, Salvador, BA, Brazil.', 'Fundacao Antonio Prudente, A.C.

The aim of the present study was to conduct a radiological, biochemical and histopathological investigation of the effect of rutin on cytarabine-associated pulmonary oedema in rats. Rats were treated with a combination of rutin+cytarabine by administering oral rutin at a dose of 50 mg/kg; other rat groups were orally administered the same volume of physiological saline. One hour after administration of rutin or saline, the rutin+cytarabine and cytarabine groups received an intraperitoneal injection of cytarabine (200 mg/kg). This administration procedure was repeated once a day for 14 days. Radiologically, 50% of the animals given cytarabine alone showed lung oedema, but the rutin+cytarabine group showed no oedema. The inclusion of rutin decreased the amounts of cytarabine-associated malondialdehyde, tumour necrosis factor-alpha, and nuclear factor-kappaB in the lung tissue. Rutin also inhibited the reduction of total glutathione by nitric oxide. These findings suggest that rutin may be a beneficial adjunct that can minimise the development of cytarabine-associated pulmonary oedema.","['Bilgin, Asli O', 'Mammadov, Renad', 'Suleyman, Bahadir', 'Unver, Edhem', 'Ozcicek, Fatih', 'Soyturk, Mehmet', 'Cimen, Ferda K', 'Kurt, Nezahat', 'Suleyman, Halis']","['Bilgin AO', 'Mammadov R', 'Suleyman B', 'Unver E', 'Ozcicek F', 'Soyturk M', 'Cimen FK', 'Kurt N', 'Suleyman H']","['Department of Pharmacology, Erzincan Binali Yildirim University, Erzincan, Turkey.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Erzincan Binali Yildirim University, Erzincan, Turkey.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Erzincan Binali Yildirim University, Erzincan, Turkey.', 'Department of Pulmonology, Erzincan Binali Yildirim University, Erzincan, Turkey.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Erzincan Binali Yildirim University, Erzincan, Turkey.', 'Department of Radiology, Erzincan Binali Yildirim University, Erzincan, Turkey.', 'Department of Pathology, Erzincan Binali Yildirim University, Erzincan, Turkey.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Ataturk University, Erzurum, Turkey.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Erzincan Binali Yildirim University, Erzincan, Turkey.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200511,Brazil,An Acad Bras Cienc,Anais da Academia Brasileira de Ciencias,7503280,"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents)', '0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Oxidants)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5G06TVY3R7 (Rutin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Antioxidants/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/*adverse effects', 'Male', 'NF-kappa B/analysis', 'Oxidants/blood', 'Oxidative Stress/drug effects', 'Pulmonary Edema/chemically induced/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Rutin/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/analysis']",,,,2020/05/14 06:00,2020/06/12 06:00,['2020/05/14 06:00'],"['2019/03/20 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/05/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/12 06:00 [medline]']","['S0001-37652020000100911 [pii]', '10.1590/0001-3765202020190261 [doi]']",ppublish,An Acad Bras Cienc. 2020;92(1):e20190261. doi: 10.1590/0001-3765202020190261.

Patients with ETP tend to have worse disease outcomes. ETP is defined by a series of immune markers. The diagnosis of ETP status can be vague due to the limitation of the current measurement. In this study, we performed unsupervised clustering and supervised prediction to investigate whether a molecular biomarker can be used to identify the ETP status in order to stratify risk groups. We found that the ETP status can be predicted by the expression level of Lymphoid enhancer binding factor 1 (LEF1) with high accuracy (AUC of ROC = 0.957 and 0.933 in two T-ALL cohorts). The patients with ETP subtype have a lower level of LEF1 comparing to the those without ETP. We suggest that incorporating the biomarker LEF1 with traditional immune-phenotyping will improve the diagnosis of ETP.","['Wang, Mei', 'Zhang, Chi']","['Wang M', 'Zhang C']","[""School of Life Science, Peking University, Beijing, People's Republic of China."", ""Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200513,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (LEF1 protein, human)', '0 (Lymphoid Enhancer-Binding Factor 1)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Biomarkers/analysis', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Lymphoid Enhancer-Binding Factor 1/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Precursor Cells, T-Lymphoid/*metabolism', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*metabolism', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Young Adult']",PMC7219738,,,2020/05/14 06:00,2020/07/29 06:00,['2020/05/14 06:00'],"['2020/01/14 00:00 [received]', '2020/04/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/05/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/29 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0232520 [doi]', 'PONE-D-20-01174 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2020 May 13;15(5):e0232520. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0232520. eCollection 2020.,['ORCID: 0000-0003-3292-1413'],['None of the authors has a relevant conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

AAML1421 is a phase I/II study of CPX-351, a liposomal preparation of daunorubicin and cytarabine. AAML1421 sought to determine the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of CPX-351 and the response rate after up to 2 cycles of therapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Children > 1 and </= 21 years of age with relapsed/refractory AML were eligible for dose finding; those in first relapse were eligible for the efficacy phase. Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) assessment occurred during cycle 1. Two cycles of therapy were offered (cycle 1: CPX-351; cycle 2: FLAG [fludarabine 30 mg/m(2)/dose on days 1-5; cytarabine 2,000 mg/m(2)/dose on days 1-5; and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor 5 microg/kg/dose, days 1-5 and day 15 through absolute neutrophil count > 500/microL]). Response was assessed after each cycle. RESULTS: Thirty-eight patients enrolled: 6 in the dose-finding phase and 32 in the efficacy phase. During dose finding, 1/6 patients experienced a DLT (grade 3 decrease in ejection fraction). The RP2D was 135 units/m(2) on days 1, 3, and 5. Toxicities of grade >/= 3 during cycle 1 included fever/neutropenia (45%), infection (47%), and rash (40%). There was no toxic mortality. Best responses included 20 complete response (CR; 54%), 5 CR with partial recovery of platelet count (CRp; 14%), and 5 CR with incomplete blood count recovery (14%). Twenty-one of 25 with CR/CRp had no detectable residual disease (RD; 84%) by flow cytometry. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) was used as consolidation in 29/30 responders (96.7%); 20/25 (80%) had no RD before HSCT. CONCLUSION: The RP2D of CPX-351 is 135 units/m(2)/dose on days 1, 3, and 5. Toxicity was manageable, and protocol therapy was effective. Response rates are superior to prior published North American cooperative group clinical trials for children with AML in first relapse.","['Cooper, Todd M', 'Absalon, Michael J', 'Alonzo, Todd A', 'Gerbing, Robert B', 'Leger, Kasey J', 'Hirsch, Betsy A', 'Pollard, Jessica', 'Razzouk, Bassem I', 'Aplenc, Richard', 'Kolb, E Anders']","['Cooper TM', 'Absalon MJ', 'Alonzo TA', 'Gerbing RB', 'Leger KJ', 'Hirsch BA', 'Pollard J', 'Razzouk BI', 'Aplenc R', 'Kolb EA']","[""Department of Hematology/Oncology, Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, Seattle Children's Hospital, Seattle, WA."", ""Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH."", 'Department of Preventive Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA.', ""Children's Oncology Group, Monrovia, CA."", ""Department of Hematology/Oncology, Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, Seattle Children's Hospital, Seattle, WA."", 'University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN.', ""Dana-Farber Cancer Institute/Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, MA."", ""Peyton Manning Children's Hospital at St Vincent, Indianapolis, IN."", ""Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA."", 'Nemours Center for Cancer and Blood Disorders/Alfred I.

Patients with cancer may have compromised immunity due to their malignancy and/or treatment, and may be at elevated risk of severe COVID-19. Community transmission of COVID-19 could overwhelm health care services, compromising delivery of cancer care. This interim consensus guidance provides advice for clinicians managing patients with cancer during the pandemic. MAIN RECOMMENDATIONS: During the COVID-19 pandemic: In patients with cancer with fever and/or respiratory symptoms, consider causes in addition to COVID-19, including other infections and therapy-related pneumonitis. For suspected or confirmed COVID-19, discuss temporary cessation of cancer therapy with a relevant specialist. Provide information on COVID-19 for patients and carers. Adopt measures within cancer centres to reduce risk of nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 acquisition; support population-wide social distancing; reduce demand on acute services; ensure adequate staffing; and provide culturally safe care. Measures should be equitable, transparent and proportionate to the COVID-19 threat. Consider the risks and benefits of modifying cancer therapies due to COVID-19. Communicate treatment modifications, and review once health service capacity allows. Consider potential impacts of COVID-19 on the blood supply and availability of stem cell donors. Discuss and document goals of care, and involve palliative care services in contingency planning. CHANGES IN MANAGEMENT AS A RESULT OF THIS STATEMENT: This interim consensus guidance provides a framework for clinicians managing patients with cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic. In view of the rapidly changing situation, clinicians must also monitor national, state, local and institutional policies, which will take precedence.

BiTE (bispecific T-cell engager) technology is a targeted immuno-oncology platform that connects patients' own T cells to malignant cells. The modular nature of BiTE technology facilitates the generation of molecules against tumor-specific antigens, allowing off-the-shelf immuno-oncotherapy. Blinatumomab was the first approved canonical BiTE molecule and targets CD19 surface antigens on B cells, making blinatumomab largely independent of genetic alterations or intracellular escape mechanisms. Additional BiTE molecules in development target other hematologic malignancies (eg, multiple myeloma, acute myeloid leukemia, and B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma) and solid tumors (eg, prostate cancer, glioblastoma, gastric cancer, and small-cell lung cancer). BiTE molecules with an extended half-life relative to the canonical BiTE molecules are also being developed.

Currently, many studies focus on exploring the role of WT1 in hematopoietic malignancies. Such studies improve the understanding of hematopoietic malignancies, and the collection of data about WT1 expression or mutation in hematopoietic malignancies over the past years can facilitate the risk stratification of hematopoietic malignancies.

This cross-sectional study was designed to address different types of fine motor impairments in Egyptian children diagnosed with ALL. METHODS: Fifty-four children treated for ALL in maintenance phase aged from four to seven years were compared with an age- and sex-matched control group. Fine motor performance was assessed using the total fine motor form of the Bruininks-Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency-second edition (BOT-2). Sex- and age-specific norms of BOT-2 were used to calculate scale and standard scores in both groups. RESULTS: Children with ALL had significantly impaired fine motor skills in all subtests and composites of BOT-2 compared with the typically developing group (P < 0.00001). Cumulative doses of vincristine, methotrexate, and dexamethasone revealed no significant correlation with any BOT-2 measure. Males performed significantly better than females in all BOT-2 scores except for the fine motor integration subtest and the total fine motor control composite as no significant differences were observed. The protocol risk stratum, duration of maintenance treatment, and the age at assessment did not significantly affect the BOT-2 measures. CONCLUSION: About 67% of children with ALL on maintenance treatment experienced fine motor difficulties. Periodic evaluation along the course of chemotherapy could identify specific impaired fine motor domains providing the base for a successful rehabilitation program.","['Hanna, Silvia', 'Elshennawy, Shorouk', 'El-Ayadi, Moatasem', 'Abdelazeim, Faten']","['Hanna S', 'Elshennawy S', 'El-Ayadi M', 'Abdelazeim F']","['Department of Physical Therapy for Pediatrics, Faculty of Physical Therapy, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Department of Physical Therapy for Pediatrics, Faculty of Physical Therapy, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, National Cancer Institute, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Department of Physical Therapy for Pediatrics, Faculty of Physical Therapy, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200513,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child Development/*drug effects', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Motor Skills Disorders/chemically induced/*diagnosis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Psychomotor Performance']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*BOT-2', '*acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*chemotherapy', '*children', '*fine motor skills']",2020/05/14 06:00,2020/08/25 06:00,['2020/05/14 06:00'],"['2019/12/16 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/27 00:00 [revised]', '2020/04/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/25 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/14 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.28385 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2020 Jul;67(7):e28385. doi: 10.1002/pbc.28385.

Most resource-limited centers lack in-house access to MTX levels, and therefore repeated monitoring is costly and cumbersome. We studied the efficacy and safety of ""solitary 36 hours post HD-MTX levels (MTX36 )."" PROCEDURE: This prospective observational study consecutively enrolled children with ALL receiving HD-MTX. Cycles with unavailable MTX36 and MTX36 > 10 mumol/L were excluded. HD-MTX was administered over 24 hours (BFM-2009 protocol) with 12 hours of prehydration. MTX36 were performed at other centers. Leucovorin was given in six hourly doses 36 hours post HD-MTX. Hydration was continued until the last dose of leucovorin. MTX toxicities, including change of creatinine from baseline at 36 hours (Cr36 ), were noted. Two groups depending on MTX36 (</=1 mumol/L vs > 1 mumol/L) received six versus eight doses of leucovorin, and toxicities were compared. RESULTS: Twenty-nine children with median age five years (1-11) who received 100 HD-MTX cycles with a median MTX dose of 3 g/m(2) (2-5) were analyzed. The median MTX36 level was 1.165 mumol/L (0.1-7.32). Toxicities of HD-MTX (CTCAE-4.0): transaminitis-22%; creatinine elevation >/= 1.25 times baseline-24%; cytopenias-16%; mucositis-17%; acute kidney injury (AKI)-6%. All toxicities were </=CTCAE grade 3. Creatinine elevation, AKI, and mucositis were significantly higher in the group with higher MTX36 . There was no correlation (r = 0.3) between Cr36 and MTX36 . MTX36 was thrice more economical than the standard protocol. CONCLUSION: MTX36 is a potential cost-effective, efficacious, and safe limited sample strategy to monitor HD-MTX, particularly in centers where in-house MTX levels are unavailable.","['Khera, Sanjeev', 'Kapoor, Rajan', 'Pramanik, Suman Kumar']","['Khera S', 'Kapoor R', 'Pramanik SK']","['Department of Pediatrics, Army Hospital Research and Referral, Delhi, 110010, India.', 'Department of Hematology, Command Hospital Kolkata, Kolkata, West Bengal, India.', 'Department of Hematology, Army Hospital Research and Referral, Delhi, India.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Observational Study']",20200513,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/adverse effects/blood/*economics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'Developing Countries', 'Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions/*blood/*economics/etiology', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/adverse effects/blood/*economics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*economics', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*ALL', '*high-dose methotrexate', '*methotrexate levels', '*methotrexate toxicities']",2020/05/14 06:00,2020/08/25 06:00,['2020/05/14 06:00'],"['2020/02/19 00:00 [received]', '2020/04/07 00:00 [revised]', '2020/04/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/25 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/14 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.28387 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2020 Jul;67(7):e28387. doi: 10.1002/pbc.28387.

The aim of this observational study was to retrospectively assess efficacy and safety of obinutuzumab + chlorambucil (G-Clb), rituximab + chlorambucil (R-Clb), and bendamustine + rituximab (BR) given as the frontline therapy within routine practice. The final analyzed dataset included 398 consecutive CLL patients from 10 hematology centers cooperating within the Czech CLL Study Group: 63 treated with G-Clb, 78 with R-Clb, and 257 with BR. There were no significant differences in prognostic and predictive markers among the groups. On the contrary, median age at the start of therapy and cumulative illness rating scale (CIRS) score was significantly higher in R-Clb group. Obinutuzumab plus chlorambucil regimen was preferably offered to elderly patients (compared to BR) with less severe comorbidities and lower CIRS score (compared to R-Clb). A time period when a treatment was indicated had also a strong impact on the choice of the regimen. The overall response rate reached 76% (30% complete remissions, CRs) in G-Clb, 75% (22% CRs) in R-Clb, and 85% (47% CRs) in BR group. Median event-free survival was 49.0 months for G-Clb, 20.3 months for R-Clb, and 37.0 months for BR group.

Herein, we investigate the effects of CD37 expression and analyze its clinical outcome in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. METHODS: The RNA-seq and clinical data of AML patients were obtained from cBioPortal database. CD37 correlated genes, the expression prolife and survival curve of eight key genes were acquired from Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA) and UALCAN. Pathway enrichment and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis were performed based on metascape databases. RESULTS: Our results showed that CD37 mRNA expression level was significantly up-regulated in patients with AML compared with healthy persons. Patients with high CD37 expression had shorter overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS). Pathway analysis data showed that CD37 is involved in DNA replication, RNA transport, Salmonella infection, ribonucleoprotein complex biogenesis, cell cycle phase transition and so on. Furthermore, we found eight genes correlated with CD37 are all highly expressed in AML patients, and high expression is associated with poor prognosis. CONCLUSION: Our study described systematical expression profiles and the prognostic values of CD37 in AML; our data suggested CD37 might be novel therapeutic target and promising prognostic biomarker in the patients.","['Zhang, Qi', 'Han, Qi', 'Zi, Jie', 'Song, Chunhua', 'Ge, Zheng']","['Zhang Q', 'Han Q', 'Zi J', 'Song C', 'Ge Z']","['Department of Hematology, Zhongda Hospital, Medical School of Southeast University, Institute of Hematology Southeast University, Nanjing 210009, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Zhongda Hospital, Medical School of Southeast University, Institute of Hematology Southeast University, Nanjing 210009, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Zhongda Hospital, Medical School of Southeast University, Institute of Hematology Southeast University, Nanjing 210009, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine, Hershey, PA 17033, U.S.A.', 'Department of Hematology, Zhongda Hospital, Medical School of Southeast University, Institute of Hematology Southeast University, Nanjing 210009, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Biosci Rep,Bioscience reports,8102797,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CD37 protein, human)', '0 (Tetraspanins)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/genetics/*metabolism', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/*metabolism', 'DNA Methylation', 'Databases, Genetic', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Regulatory Networks', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*metabolism/mortality/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Protein Interaction Maps', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tetraspanins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcriptome', 'Up-Regulation']",PMC7253400,['NOTNLM'],"['*CD37', '*acute myeloid leukaemia', '*gene expression', '*prognosis']",2020/05/14 06:00,2021/03/24 06:00,['2020/05/14 06:00'],"['2020/01/07 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/05 00:00 [revised]', '2020/05/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/24 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/14 06:00 [entrez]']","['224123 [pii]', '10.1042/BSR20200008 [doi]']",ppublish,Biosci Rep. 2020 May 29;40(5). pii: 224123. doi: 10.1042/BSR20200008.,,,['(c) 2020 The Author(s).'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We retrospectively analyzed the data from the centralized ""Annual Report of Autopsy Cases in Japan"" that archives the national autopsy cases since 1989. Among the total of 175,615 archived autopsy cases, 7183 cases (4.1%) were acute leukemia and MDS patients. While VM was only found in 7756 cases (4.4% in total cases), we found VM had a disproportionally high prevalence among acute leukemia and MDS patients: 1562 VM cases (21.7%) and nearly sixfold higher in prevalence. Aspergillus spp. was the most predominant causative agent (45.0%), and Candida spp. was the second (22.7%) among confirmed single pathogen involved cases. The prevalence of Candida spp. infection decreased about 50% due to the widely use of fluconazole prophylaxis, which may skew toward doubling of the Mucormycetes incidence compared to 30 years ago. Complicated fungal infection (> one pathogen) was 11.0% in acute leukemia and MDS in 2015. It was 14.7 times higher than in other populations. Among 937 patients who received allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), the prevalence of VM was 28.3% and 23.3% with GVHD. Aspergillus spp. was less prevalent, but Candida spp. was more associated with GVHD. Its prevalence remains stable. Although Aspergillus spp. was the primary causative agent, non-albicans Candida spp. was increasing as a breakthrough infection especially in GVHD cases. Complicated pathogen cases were more common in acute leukemia and MDS.","['Togano, Tomiteru', 'Suzuki, Yuhko', 'Nakamura, Fumihiko', 'Tse, William', 'Kume, Hikaru']","['Togano T', 'Suzuki Y', 'Nakamura F', 'Tse W', 'Kume H']","['Department of Hematology, National Center for Global Health and Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Blood and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Department of Medicine, University of Louisville School of Medicine, Louisville, KY, USA.', 'Department of Blood Transfusion and Transplantation Immunology, Fukushima Medical University School of Medicine, Fukushima, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, National Center for Global Health and Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Blood and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Department of Medicine, University of Louisville School of Medicine, Louisville, KY, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Kitasato University, School of Medicine, Sagamihara, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,England,Med Mycol,Medical mycology,9815835,,IM,"['Autopsy/*statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Japan/epidemiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*complications', 'Mycoses/*etiology/*physiopathology', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/complications', 'Prevalence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Viscera/*physiopathology']",,['NOTNLM'],"['GVHD', 'acute leukemia', 'autopsy cases', 'epidemiology', 'visceral mycoses']",2020/05/14 06:00,2021/07/28 06:00,['2020/05/14 06:00'],"['2019/11/04 00:00 [received]', '2020/04/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/04/03 00:00 [revised]', '2020/05/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/28 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/14 06:00 [entrez]']","['5836560 [pii]', '10.1093/mmy/myaa029 [doi]']",ppublish,Med Mycol. 2021 Jan 4;59(1):50-57. doi: 10.1093/mmy/myaa029.,,,"['(c) The Author(s) 2020.

In the medical area, visual analysis of microscopic images has regularly used biological samples to recognize hematological disorders. Nowadays, techniques of image recognition are needed to achieve an adequate identification of blood tissues. This paper presents a procedure to acquire expert knowledge from blood cell images. We apply Gaussian mixtures, evolutionary computing, and standard techniques of image processing to extract knowledge. This information feeds a support vector machine or multilayer perceptron to classify healthy or leukemic cells. Additionally, convolutional neural networks are used as a benchmark to compare our proposed method with the state of the art. We use a public database of 260 healthy and leukemic cell images. Results show that our traditional pattern recognition methodology matches deep learning accuracy since the recognition of blood cells achieves 99.63%, whereas the convolutional neural networks reach 97.74% on average. Moreover, the computational effort of our approach is minimal, while meeting the requirement of being explainable.","['Ochoa-Montiel, Rocio', 'Olague, Gustavo', 'Sossa, Humberto']","['Ochoa-Montiel R', 'Olague G', 'Sossa H']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,Appl Opt,Applied optics,0247660,,IM,"['Blood Cells/classification', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Databases, Factual', 'Deep Learning', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Humans', 'Image Processing, Computer-Assisted/*methods', 'Leukemia/*diagnostic imaging', 'Neural Networks, Computer', '*Support Vector Machine']",,,,2020/05/14 06:00,2021/04/20 06:00,['2020/05/14 06:00'],"['2020/05/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/05/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/20 06:00 [medline]']","['431557 [pii]', '10.1364/AO.385208 [doi]']",ppublish,Appl Opt. 2020 May 10;59(14):4448-4460. doi: 10.1364/AO.385208.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Aspirin may decrease VTE in the general population without significant bleeding. Here, we examined whether aspirin is associated with reduced rates of VTE in older patients with cancer. METHODS AND RESULTS: Using the National Inpatient Sample 2016, we retrospectively identified a cohort of patients with cancer >/=65 years old who received aspirin and a similar cohort who did not receive aspirin (n = 31 654, each). The cohorts were matched for age, sex, race, patient demographics, insurance, hospital demographics, and 9 comorbidities (smoking, obesity, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, congestive heart failure, and history of deep venous thrombosis [DVT]/pulmonary embolism [PE]). Primary outcomes were discharge diagnosis of acute PE or acute DVT. Secondary outcomes were inhospital mortality, bleeding, length of hospital stay (LOS), and total hospitalization cost. The aspirin group, compared with the nonaspirin group, had a significantly lower incidence of acute PE (matched, 2.1% vs 2.6%, P < .001), acute DVT (matched, 2.3% vs 3.2%, P < .001), and inhospital mortality (matched 4.0% vs 6.5%, P < .001); shorter LOS (matched, 5.29 +/- 5.01 vs 6.20 +/- 6.56 days, P < .001); and lower total costs (matched, US$14 700 +/- 15 031 vs US$16 363 +/- 20 219, P < .001). The primary and secondary outcomes were similar before and after propensity matching. We found no increase in bleeding in the aspirin group compared to the nonaspirin group: gastrointestinal bleeding (matched, 3.8% vs 4.0%, P= .168), hematuria (matched, 3.5% vs 3.7%, P = .102), hemoptysis (matched, 0.9% vs 0.9%, P = .532), and hemorrhagic stroke (matched, 0.8% vs 0.8%, P = .443). In subgroup analyses, aspirin was associated with decreased inhospital mortality, mostly in patients with lung, colon, pancreatic, prostate, breast cancer, lymphoma, and leukemia.

The purpose of this study was to describe treatment patterns, adverse events (AEs), and economic burden among treated patients with CLL. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted with IQVIA PharMetrics((R)) Plus. Patients at least 18 years old with CLL treatment between November 1, 2013 and May 31, 2018 were identified; index date was first observed CLL treatment. Patients had at least one CLL diagnosis pre-index and a second diagnosis anytime during the study period, at least 1-year pre- and at least 30-day post-index continuous enrollment and no pre-index CLL treatment. Analyses focused on patients receiving one of the four most common regimens observed. Outcomes included treatment patterns, frequency of incident AEs, and healthcare resource use and costs. Multivariable logistic regression and generalized linear modelling were used to evaluate risk of hospitalization and all-cause costs per patient per month (PPPM). RESULTS: A total of 1706 patients were included in the study (median [interquartile range] age 58 [55-62] years, 66% male, median Charlson Comorbidity Index 2 [2-3], median follow-up 16 [8-28] months). Common regimens, irrespective of treatment line, were bendamustine-rituximab (B-R, 27%), ibrutinib monotherapy (I, 27%), rituximab monotherapy (R, 19%), and fludarabine combined with cyclophosphamide and rituximab (FCR, 16%); 59% had at least one incident AE (B-R, 62%; I, 60%; R, 25%; FCR, 79%). Mean total all-cause healthcare cost over follow-up was $13,858 +/- 14,626 PPPM. Increased number of AEs was associated with increased odds of hospitalization (odds ratio = 2.9; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.5-3.4) and increased mean cost PPPM (cost ratio = 1.2; 95% CI 1.1-1.2). CONCLUSION: This study highlights the treatment toxicity and associated economic burden among patients with CLL in the USA. As novel therapies are increasingly used, further research examining outcomes will inform the risks, benefits, and value of novel agents to prescribers and patients.","['Kabadi, Shaum M', 'Near, Aimee', 'Wada, Keiko', 'Burudpakdee, Chakkarin']","['Kabadi SM', 'Near A', 'Wada K', 'Burudpakdee C']","['AstraZeneca, Gaithersburg, MD, USA.', 'IQVIA, Falls Church, VA, USA.', 'IQVIA, Falls Church, VA, USA.

RESULTS: We developed Cell cOmmunication exploration with MUltiplex NETworks (COMUNET), a tool that streamlines the interpretation of the results from cell-cell communication analyses. COMUNET uses multiplex networks to represent and cluster all potential communication patterns between cell types. The algorithm also enables the search for specific patterns of communication and can perform comparative analysis between two biological conditions. To exemplify its use, here we apply COMUNET to investigate cell communication patterns in single-cell transcriptomic datasets from mouse embryos and from an acute myeloid leukemia patient at diagnosis and after treatment.

This type of relapse is commonly observed in the central nervous system, while it is rare in the testicles and skin. Chimeric antigen receptor-modified T cell (CAR-T) therapy targeting CD19 has shown to be a beneficial treatment approach for relapsed/refractory B cell acute lymphoblasticleukemia (r/r B-ALL). Yet, few studies have reported data regarding the treatment of extramedullary B-ALL relapse, especially both in skin and testicle, with CAR-T therapy. Case presentation: Here we reported a single case of a patient with relapsed B-ALL in skin and testicle who was successfully treated by the shRNA-IL6-modified anti-CD19 CAR-T(ssCAR-T-19) therapy. A 29-year-old man with relapsed B-ALL in skin and testicle was enrolled in clinal trial involving the shRNA-IL6-modified anti-CD19 CAR-T(ssCAR-T-19) therapy (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT03919240). The patient had toxicity consistent with the grade 1 cytokine release syndrome. Conclusions: ssCART-19 therapy may be used to effectively eliminate infiltrating leukemia cells in the skin and testicle with mild toxicity, which could be a much safer approach to bridge allo-HSCT, thus further improving the patient's outcome.

Mitochondria continuously switch their morphology between elongated tubular and fragmented globular via mitochondrial fusion and fission. Mitochondrial fusion is mediated by proteins encoded by Mfn1, Mfn2, and Opa1, whereas mitochondrial fission is mediated by proteins encoded by Fis1 and Dnm1L. Here, we investigated the expression patterns of mitochondria-related genes during the differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Pluripotent ESCs maintain stemness in the presence of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) via the JAK-STAT3 pathway but lose pluripotency and differentiate in response to the withdrawal of LIF. We analyzed the expression levels of mitochondrial fusion- and fission-related genes during the differentiation of ESCs. We hypothesized that mitochondrial fusion genes would be overexpressed while the fission genes would be downregulated during the differentiation of ESCs. Though the mitochondria exhibited an elongated morphology in ESCs differentiating in response to LIF withdrawal, only the expression of Mfn2 was increased and that of Dnm1L was decreased as expected, the other exceptions being Mfn1, Opa1, and Fis1. Next, by comparing gene expression and mitochondrial morphology, we proposed an index that could precisely represent mitochondrial changes during the differentiation of pluripotent stem cells by analyzing the expression ratios of three fusion- and two fission-related genes. Surprisingly, increased Mfn2/Dnm1L ratio was correlated with elongation of mitochondria during the differentiation of ESCs. Moreover, application of this index to other specialized cell types revealed that neural stems cells (NSCs) and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) showed increased Mfn2/Dnm1L ratio compared to ESCs. Thus, we suggest that the Mfn2/Dnm1L ratio could reflect changes in mitochondrial morphology according to the extent of differentiation.","['Lee, Jeong Eon', 'Seo, Bong Jong', 'Han, Min Ji', 'Hong, Yean Ju', 'Hong, Kwonho', 'Song, Hyuk', 'Lee, Jeong Woong', 'Do, Jeong Tae']","['Lee JE', 'Seo BJ', 'Han MJ', 'Hong YJ', 'Hong K', 'Song H', 'Lee JW', 'Do JT']","['Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Biotechnology, KU Institute of Science and Technology, Konkuk University, 120 Neungdong-ro, Gwangjin-gu, Seoul 05029, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Biotechnology, KU Institute of Science and Technology, Konkuk University, 120 Neungdong-ro, Gwangjin-gu, Seoul 05029, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Biotechnology, KU Institute of Science and Technology, Konkuk University, 120 Neungdong-ro, Gwangjin-gu, Seoul 05029, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Biotechnology, KU Institute of Science and Technology, Konkuk University, 120 Neungdong-ro, Gwangjin-gu, Seoul 05029, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Biotechnology, KU Institute of Science and Technology, Konkuk University, 120 Neungdong-ro, Gwangjin-gu, Seoul 05029, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Biotechnology, KU Institute of Science and Technology, Konkuk University, 120 Neungdong-ro, Gwangjin-gu, Seoul 05029, Republic of Korea.', 'Biotherapeutics Translational Research Center, Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology, Daejeon 305-806, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Biotechnology, KU Institute of Science and Technology, Konkuk University, 120 Neungdong-ro, Gwangjin-gu, Seoul 05029, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200128,United States,Stem Cells Int,Stem cells international,101535822,,,,PMC7204333,,,2020/05/14 06:00,2020/05/14 06:01,['2020/05/14 06:00'],"['2019/08/22 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/17 00:00 [revised]', '2020/01/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/05/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/14 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1155/2020/9369268 [doi]'],epublish,Stem Cells Int. 2020 Jan 28;2020:9369268. doi: 10.1155/2020/9369268. eCollection 2020.,"['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2649-9677', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6721-1441']",['The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.'],['Copyright (c) 2020 Jeong Eon Lee et al.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ASXL1 was originally identified as tumor suppressor gene, in which loss of function causes myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). ASXL1 mutations are common and associated with disease progression in myeloid malignancies including MDS, acute myeloid leukemia, and similarly in CML. In MDS, ASXL1 mutations have been associated with poor prognosis; however, the impact of ASXL1 mutations in CML has not been well described. A 31-year-old male was diagnosed as CML-chronic phase (CP). Laboratory findings showed a white blood cell count of 187,200/microL, with asymptomatic splenomegaly. Blast count was 5.0% in peripheral blood and 7.3% in bone marrow. There was no additional chromosomal abnormality except for t(9;22)(q34;q11.2) by chromosomal analysis. At onset, the Sokal score was 1.4, indicating high risk. The patient received tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy, comprising nilotinib approximately 600 mg/day, bosutinib approximately 600 mg/day, ponatinib approximately 45 mg/day, and dasatinib approximately 100 mg/day. Nevertheless, after 1.5 years of continuous TKI therapy, the best outcome was a hematological response. Although additional chromosomal aberrations and ABL1 kinase mutations were analyzed repeatedly before and during TKI therapy, known genetic abnormalities were not detected. Thereafter, the patient underwent bone marrow transplantation from an HLA 7/8 matched unrelated donor (HLA-Cw 1 locus mismatch, graft-versus-host direction). The patient achieved neutrophil engraftment, 18 days after transplantation, leading to complete remission with an undetectable level of BCR-ABL1 mRNA. The patient, however, died from graft-versus-host disease and thrombotic microangiopathy after 121 days. Gene sequence analysis of his CML cell before stem cell transplantation revealed ASXL1 mutations. Physiologically, ASXL1 contributes to epigenetic regulation. In the CML-CP patient in this case report, ASXL1 mutation conferred resistance to TKI through obscure resistance mechanisms. Even though a molecular mechanism for TKI resistance in ASXL1 mutation in CML has remained obscure, epigenetic modulation is a plausible mode of CML disease progression. The clinical impact including prognosis of ASXL1 for CML is underscored. And the treatment strategy of CML with ASXL1 mutation has not been established. A discussion of this case was expected to facilitate treatment options.","['Imataki, Osamu', 'Ishida, Tomoya', 'Kubo, Hiroyuki', 'Uemura, Makiko', 'Nanya, Yasuhito', 'Kawakami, Kimihiro', 'Ogawa, Seishi', 'Kadowaki, Norimitsu']","['Imataki O', 'Ishida T', 'Kubo H', 'Uemura M', 'Nanya Y', 'Kawakami K', 'Ogawa S', 'Kadowaki N']","['Division of Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, Kagawa University, Kagawa, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, Kagawa University, Kagawa, Japan.', 'Kagawa University Hospital Post Graduate Clinical Education Center, Kagawa, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, Kagawa University, Kagawa, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, Kagawa University, Kagawa, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology and Tumor Biology, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Kagawa Prefectural Central Hospital, Kagawa, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology and Tumor Biology, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, Kagawa University, Kagawa, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Case Reports'],20200422,Switzerland,Case Rep Oncol,Case reports in oncology,101517601,,,,PMC7204851,['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic myeloid leukemia', 'Clonal evolution', 'Drug resistance', 'Leukemia oncogenesis', 'Tyrosine kinase inhibitor']",2020/05/14 06:00,2020/05/14 06:01,['2020/05/14 06:00'],"['2020/02/07 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/05/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/14 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1159/000506452 [doi]', 'cro-0013-0449 [pii]']",epublish,Case Rep Oncol. 2020 Apr 22;13(1):449-455. doi: 10.1159/000506452. eCollection 2020 Jan-Apr.,,"['The authors declare no competing interests.

Understanding the mechanisms behind beta-cell failure is critical to prevent or revert disease. Basic pathogenic differences exist in the two forms of diabetes mellitus; T1DM is immune mediated and T2DM is mediated by metabolic mechanisms. These mechanisms differentially affect early beta-cell dysfunction and eventual fate. Over the past decade, major advances have been made in the field, mostly delivered by studies on beta-cells in human disease. These advances include studies of islet morphology and human beta-cell gene expression in T1DM and T2DM, the identification and characterization of the role of T1DM and T2DM candidate genes at the beta-cell level and the endoplasmic reticulum stress signalling that contributes to beta-cell failure in T1DM (mostly IRE1 driven) and T2DM (mostly PERK-eIF2alpha dependent).

We investigated the role of these mechanisms at the HOXA cluster in AML cells with the common NPM1c mutation, which express both HOXA and HOXB genes. CTCF binding at the HOXA locus is conserved across primary AML samples, regardless of HOXA gene expression, and defines a continuous chromatin domain marked by COMPASS-associated histone H3 trimethylation in NPM1-mutant primary AML samples. Profiling of the three-dimensional chromatin architecture in primary AML samples with the NPM1c mutation identified chromatin loops between the HOXA cluster and loci in the SNX10 and SKAP2 genes, and an intergenic region located 1.4 Mbp upstream of the HOXA locus. Deletion of CTCF binding sites in the NPM1-mutant OCI-AML3 AML cell line reduced multiple long-range interactions, but resulted in CTCF-independent loops with sequences in SKAP2 that were marked by enhancer-associated histone modifications in primary AML samples. HOXA gene expression was maintained in CTCF binding site mutants, indicating that transcriptional activity at the HOXA locus in NPM1-mutant AML cells may be sustained through persistent interactions with SKAP2 enhancers, or by intrinsic factors within the HOXA gene cluster.","['Ghasemi, Reza', 'Struthers, Heidi', 'Wilson, Elisabeth R', 'Spencer, David H']","['Ghasemi R', 'Struthers H', 'Wilson ER', 'Spencer DH']","['Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Section of Stem Cell Biology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO, USA.', 'Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Section of Stem Cell Biology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO, USA.', 'Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Section of Stem Cell Biology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO, USA.', 'Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Section of Stem Cell Biology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO, USA. dspencer@wustl.edu.', 'McDonnell Genome Institute, Washington University, St. Louis, MO, USA. dspencer@wustl.edu.']",['eng'],"['K08CA190815/U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services | NIH | National', 'Cancer Institute (NCI)', 'P50 CA171963/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'IRG-58-010-61-4/American Cancer Society (American Cancer Society, Inc.)', 'P30 CA091842/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA101937/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K08 CA190815/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200512,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (CCCTC-Binding Factor)', '0 (CTCF protein, human)', '0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (SNX10 protein, human)', '0 (Sorting Nexins)', '0 (src kinase associated phosphoprotein 2)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', '157907-48-7 (HoxA protein)']",IM,"['Binding Sites', 'CCCTC-Binding Factor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Chromatin/genetics/*metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Histones/genetics/metabolism', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', '*Mutation', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Protein Binding', 'Sorting Nexins/genetics/metabolism']",PMC7657955,,,2020/05/14 06:00,2021/02/26 06:00,['2020/05/14 06:00'],"['2019/12/28 00:00 [received]', '2020/04/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/04/23 00:00 [revised]', '2020/05/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/26 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/14 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-020-0856-3 [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-020-0856-3 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2021 Feb;35(2):404-416. doi: 10.1038/s41375-020-0856-3.

MBNL1, a protein involved in alternative splicing, is consistently overexpressed in MLL-rearranged leukemias. We found that MBNL1 loss significantly impairs propagation of murine and human MLL-rearranged leukemia in vitro and in vivo. Through transcriptomic profiling of our experimental systems, we show that in leukemic cells, MBNL1 regulates alternative splicing (predominantly intron exclusion) of several genes including those essential for MLL-rearranged leukemogenesis, such as DOT1L and SETD1A. We finally show that selective leukemic cell death is achievable with a small molecule inhibitor of MBNL1. These findings provide the basis for a new therapeutic target in MLL-rearranged leukemia and act as further validation of a burgeoning paradigm in targeted therapy, namely the disruption of cancer-specific splicing programs through the targeting of selectively essential RNA binding proteins.","['Itskovich, Svetlana S', 'Gurunathan, Arun', 'Clark, Jason', 'Burwinkel, Matthew', 'Wunderlich, Mark', 'Berger, Mikaela R', 'Kulkarni, Aishwarya', 'Chetal, Kashish', 'Venkatasubramanian, Meenakshi', 'Salomonis, Nathan', 'Kumar, Ashish R', 'Lee, Lynn H']","['Itskovich SS', 'Gurunathan A', 'Clark J', 'Burwinkel M', 'Wunderlich M', 'Berger MR', 'Kulkarni A', 'Chetal K', 'Venkatasubramanian M', 'Salomonis N', 'Kumar AR', 'Lee LH']","[""Division of Bone Marrow Transplantation and Immune Deficiency, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, 45229, USA."", ""Cancer and Blood Diseases Institute, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, 45229, USA."", ""Division of Bone Marrow Transplantation and Immune Deficiency, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, 45229, USA."", ""Division of Bone Marrow Transplantation and Immune Deficiency, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, 45229, USA."", ""Division of Experimental Hematology and Cancer Biology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, 45229, USA."", 'College of Medicine, University of Cincinnati School of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH, 45267, USA.', 'Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH, 45221, USA.', ""Division of Biomedical Informatics, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, 45229, USA."", ""Division of Biomedical Informatics, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, 45229, USA."", 'Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH, 45221, USA.', ""Division of Biomedical Informatics, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, 45229, USA."", ""Division of Biomedical Informatics, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, 45229, USA."", 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Cincinnati School of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH, 45229, USA.', ""Division of Bone Marrow Transplantation and Immune Deficiency, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, 45229, USA."", 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Cincinnati School of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH, 45229, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Cincinnati School of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH, 45229, USA. lynn.lee@cchmc.org.', ""Division of Oncology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, 45229, USA. lynn.lee@cchmc.org.""]",['eng'],"['R01 CA226802/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R50 CA211404/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'S10 OD023410/OD/NIH HHS/United States', 'L40 HL143713/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200512,England,Nat Commun,Nature communications,101528555,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MBNL1 protein, human)', '0 (MLL-AF9 fusion protein, human)', '0 (Mbnl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (DOT1L protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Setd1A protein, human)']",IM,"['Alternative Splicing', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Datasets as Topic', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/genetics', 'Humans', 'Introns/genetics', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Primary Cell Culture', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA-Seq', 'Transplantation Chimera', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",PMC7217953,,,2020/05/14 06:00,2020/09/01 06:00,['2020/05/14 06:00'],"['2019/01/27 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/05/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/01 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41467-020-15733-8 [doi]', '10.1038/s41467-020-15733-8 [pii]']",epublish,Nat Commun. 2020 May 12;11(1):2369. doi: 10.1038/s41467-020-15733-8.,"['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3332-7395', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7812-4685', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9689-2469', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8306-8419', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2898-6196']",,,['Nat Commun. 2020 Jul 7;11(1):3468.

However, significant dysgranulopoiesis is not a feature of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Systemic mastocytosis (SM) with an associated hematologic neoplasm (SM-AHN) comprises 5% to 40% of cases of SM. All types of hematologic neoplasms have been previously reported, although CML has been rarely encountered. CASE REPORT A 28-year-old male presented with a 3-month-history of weight loss and massive splenomegaly. Peripheral blood revealed marked leukocytosis, shift to left with 13% blasts. There was evident dysgranulopoiesis that raised a provisional diagnosis of myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm. Bone marrow (BM) examination revealed granulocytic hyperplasia with 10% blasts and significant dysgranulopoiesis. Unexpectedly, cytogenetic analysis revealed t(9;22) with BCR/ABL1 rearrangement, diagnostic of chronic myeloid leukemia in an accelerated phase. The patient was started on dasatinib 100 mg upfront, however, he failed to respond, with increasing leukocytosis. Repeat BM examination showed persistence of the findings with 8% blasts. At this time, aggregates of mast cells with aberrant expression of CD25 were elicited, thus concluding the diagnosis of SM-AHN. The patient failed multiple lines of treatment (dasatinib, nilotinib, hydroxyurea, cytarabine subcutaneous, 6-mercaptopurine and interferon) and progressed to the blast phase a few months later. CONCLUSIONS We report an unusual case of CML, presented with significant dysgranulopoiesis with an aggressive clinical course including SM uncovered during the disease course with subsequent transformation to the blast phase. The different biological behavior of this case underscores the need for studies on a larger number of cases to explore the significance of the aforementioned coexistent features.","['Ibrahim, Feryal A', 'Abdulla, Mohammad A J', 'Soliman, Dina', 'Al Sabbagh, Ahmad', 'Nawaz, Zafar', 'Akiki, Susanna Jane', 'Shwaylia, Hawraa', 'Yassin, Mohamed A']","['Ibrahim FA', 'Abdulla MAJ', 'Soliman D', 'Al Sabbagh A', 'Nawaz Z', 'Akiki SJ', 'Shwaylia H', 'Yassin MA']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, National Center for Cancer Care and Research, Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Hematology Section, National Center for Cancer Care and Research, Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, National Center for Cancer Care and Research, Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar.', 'Department of Clinical Pathology, National Cancer Institute, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, National Center for Cancer Care and Research, Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Cytogenetics, and Molecular Genetics, Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Cytogenetics, and Molecular Genetics, Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Hematology Section, National Center for Cancer Care and Research, Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Hematology Section, National Center for Cancer Care and Research, Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",20200513,United States,Am J Case Rep,The American journal of case reports,101489566,,IM,"['Adult', 'Blast Crisis/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*pathology', 'Male', 'Mastocytosis, Systemic/*pathology']",PMC7252834,,,2020/05/14 06:00,2021/01/06 06:00,['2020/05/14 06:00'],"['2020/05/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/05/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/06 06:00 [medline]']","['923354 [pii]', '10.12659/AJCR.923354 [doi]']",epublish,Am J Case Rep. 2020 May 13;21:e923354. doi: 10.12659/AJCR.923354.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of this review is to describe the role of PHF6 in normal hematopoiesis and leukemogenesis based on recent findings from knockout mouse models. RECENT FINDINGS: In a mouse model, the loss of Phf6 enhanced the bone marrow repopulating capacity of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) during serial transplantations without transforming hematopoietic cells, whereas donor mice, which lacked Phf6 expression in the hematopoietic system, did not show any apparent phenotypes in the steady-state. Mechanistically, Phf6 activates effectors in the tumor necrosis factor alpha (Tnfalpha) pathway. Therefore, a Phf6 deficiency attenuates the expression of the effectors and confers resistance against Tnfalpha-mediated growth inhibition to HSCs. Moreover, the loss of Phf6 promoted the development of leukemia induced by aberrant TLX3 expression or an active NOTCH mutation. SUMMARY: Phf6 restricts the self-renewal of HSCs by governing the Tnfalpha pathway. Phf6 fulfills a tumor-suppressive function, and its loss synergizes with leukemic lesions to promote the onset of hematological malignancies.","['Miyagi, Satoru', 'Iwama, Atsushi']","['Miyagi S', 'Iwama A']","['Department of Life Science, Faculty of Medicine, Shimane University, Shimane.', 'Division of Stem Cell and Molecular Medicine, Center for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,"['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (PHF6 protein, human)', '0 (Phf6 protein, mouse)', '0 (Receptors, Notch)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (TLX3 protein, human)', '0 (Tlx3 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Carcinogenesis/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Notch/genetics/metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics/*metabolism']",,,,2020/05/14 06:00,2021/01/08 06:00,['2020/05/14 06:00'],"['2020/05/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/08 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/14 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/MOH.0000000000000588 [doi]', '00062752-202007000-00006 [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2020 Jul;27(4):248-253. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0000000000000588.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This review describes the functional properties of p13, an 87-amino acid protein coded by HTLV-1 open reading frame II (orf-II). p13 is mainly localized in the inner membrane of the mitochondria, where it induces potassium (K(+)) influx and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, which can trigger either proliferation or apoptosis, depending on the ROS setpoint of the cell. Recent evidence indicates that p13 may influence the cell's innate immune response to viral infection and the infected cell phenotype. Association of the HTLV-1 transcriptional activator, Tax, with p13 increases p13's stability, leads to its partial co-localization with Tax in nuclear speckles, and reduces the ability of Tax to interact with the transcription cofactor CBP/p300. Comparison of p13 sequences isolated from HTLV-1-infected individuals revealed a small number of amino acid variations in the domains controlling the subcellular localization of the protein. Disruptive mutations of p13 were found in samples obtained from asymptomatic patients with low proviral load. p13 sequences of HTLV-1 subtype C isolates from indigenous Australian patients showed a high degree of identity among each other, with all samples containing a pattern of 5 amino acids that distinguished them from other subtypes. Further characterization of p13's functional properties and sequence variants may lead to a deeper understanding of the impact of p13 as a contributor to the clinical manifestations of HTLV-1 infection.","['Omsland, Maria', 'Silic-Benussi, Micol', 'Moles, Ramona', 'Sarkis, Sarkis', 'Purcell, Damian F J', 'Yurick, David', 'Khoury, Georges', ""D'Agostino, Donna M"", 'Ciminale, Vincenzo', 'Franchini, Genoveffa']","['Omsland M', 'Silic-Benussi M', 'Moles R', 'Sarkis S', 'Purcell DFJ', 'Yurick D', 'Khoury G', ""D'Agostino DM"", 'Ciminale V', 'Franchini G']","['Animal Models and Retroviral Vaccines Section, Vaccine Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Veneto Institute of Oncology IOV-IRCCS, Padua, Italy.', 'Animal Models and Retroviral Vaccines Section, Vaccine Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Animal Models and Retroviral Vaccines Section, Vaccine Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, The Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity, University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, The Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity, University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, The Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity, University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', 'Division of Microbiology and Immunology, Yerkes National Primate Research Center, Emory University, Atlanta, GA, USA.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Padua, Padua, Italy.', 'Veneto Institute of Oncology IOV-IRCCS, Padua, Italy.', 'Department of Surgery, Oncology, and Gastroenterology, University of Padua, Padua, Italy.', 'Animal Models and Retroviral Vaccines Section, Vaccine Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA. franchig@mail.nih.gov.']",['eng'],"['17794/Italian Association for Cancer Research/International', 'APP1129320/National Health and Medical Research Council of', 'Australia/International', 'APP1052979/National Health and Medical Research Council of', 'Australia/International']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20200512,England,Retrovirology,Retrovirology,101216893,"['0 (Retroviridae Proteins)', '0 (rof protein, Human T-lymphotropic virus 1)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Genetic Variation', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Retroviridae Proteins/*genetics']",PMC7218495,['NOTNLM'],"['*Cell death', '*HTLV-1', '*HTLV-1C', '*Human T cell leukemia virus type-1', '*Mitochondria', '*p13']",2020/05/14 06:00,2021/03/11 06:00,['2020/05/14 06:00'],"['2020/01/23 00:00 [received]', '2020/04/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/05/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/11 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12977-020-00517-1 [doi]', '10.1186/s12977-020-00517-1 [pii]']",epublish,Retrovirology. 2020 May 12;17(1):11. doi: 10.1186/s12977-020-00517-1.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the impact of tuberculosis on global cancer burden is unknown. METHODS: We performed random-effects meta-analyses and meta-regressions of studies reporting the association between tuberculosis and cancer risks by searching PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Cochrane library, and CINAHL from inception to 1 June 2019. Population attributable fractions (PAFs) of cancer incidence attributable to tuberculosis were calculated using relative risks from our meta-analyses and tuberculosis prevalence data from Global Health Data Exchange by age, sex, and country. The study has been registered with PROSPERO (CRD42016050691). RESULTS: Fourty nine studies with 52,480 cancer cases met pre-specified inclusion criteria. Tuberculosis was associated with head and neck cancer (RR 2.64[95% CI 2.00-3.48]), hepatobiliary cancer (2.43[1.82-3.25]), Hodgkin's lymphoma (2.19[1.62-2.97]), lung cancer (1.69[1.46-1.95]), gastrointestinal cancer (1.62[1.26-2.08]), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (1.61[1.34-1.94]), pancreatic cancer (1.58[1.28-1.96]), leukaemia (1.55[1.25-1.93]), kidney and bladder cancer (1.54[1.21-1.97]), and ovarian cancer (1.43[1.04-1.97]). We estimated that 2.33%(1.14-3.81) or 381,035(187145-623,404) of global cancer incidences in 2015 were attributable to tuberculosis. The PAFs varied by Socio-demographic Index (SDI)-ranging from 1.28% (0.57-2.31%) in the high-SDI countries to 3.51% (1.84-5.42%) in the middle-SDI countries. Individually, China and India accounted for 47% of all tuberculosis-related cancer cases. CONCLUSIONS: Tuberculosis is associated with increased risk of cancer at ten sites.

Results: Among 30 virtual screening hits, five compounds show inhibitory activities against Mcl-1. The most potent inhibitors M02 (K i = 5.4 muM) and M08 (Ki = 0.53 muM) exhibit good selectivity against Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL. Compound M08 exhibits anti-proliferation activity and induces caspase-3 activation in Jurkat cancer cells. Moreover, (1)H(15)N HSQC NMR experiments suggested that compound M08 likely binds in the P2 pocket of Mcl-1 and engages R263 in a salt bridge. Conclusion: Our study provides a good starting point for future discovery of more potent Mcl-1 selective inhibitors.","['Du, Jintong', 'Liu, Lulu', 'Liu, Bo', 'Yang, Jing', 'Hou, Xuben', 'Yu, Jinming', 'Fang, Hao']","['Du J', 'Liu L', 'Liu B', 'Yang J', 'Hou X', 'Yu J', 'Fang H']","['Shandong Cancer Hospital, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, 250117, PR China.', 'Shandong Cancer Hospital & Institute, Shandong First Medical University & Shandong Academy of Medical Sciences, Jinan, Shandong, 250117, PR China.', 'Department of Medicinal Chemistry & Key Laboratory of Chemical Biology of Natural Products (MOE), School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, 250012, PR China.', 'Shandong Cancer Hospital & Institute, Shandong First Medical University & Shandong Academy of Medical Sciences, Jinan, Shandong, 250117, PR China.', 'Shandong Cancer Hospital & Institute, Shandong First Medical University & Shandong Academy of Medical Sciences, Jinan, Shandong, 250117, PR China.', 'Department of Medicinal Chemistry & Key Laboratory of Chemical Biology of Natural Products (MOE), School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, 250012, PR China.', 'Shandong Cancer Hospital & Institute, Shandong First Medical University & Shandong Academy of Medical Sciences, Jinan, Shandong, 250117, PR China.', 'Department of Medicinal Chemistry & Key Laboratory of Chemical Biology of Natural Products (MOE), School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, 250012, PR China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200513,England,Future Med Chem,Future medicinal chemistry,101511162,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Humans', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Structure', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Mcl-1 inhibitor', '*anticancer', '*apoptosis', '*protein-protein interactions', '*virtual screening']",2020/05/14 06:00,2021/07/15 06:00,['2020/05/14 06:00'],"['2020/05/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/15 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/14 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.4155/fmc-2020-0114 [doi]'],ppublish,Future Med Chem. 2020 Jul;12(14):1293-1304. doi: 10.4155/fmc-2020-0114.

Patients with FA show DNA fragility due to a defect in the DNA repair machinery based on predominately recessive mutations in 23 genes. Interestingly, patients originating from the same family and sharing an identical mutation, frequently show significant differences in their clinical presentation. This implies that epigenetics plays an important role in the manifestation of the disease. The biologically active form of vitamin D, 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 controls cellular growth, differentiation and apoptosis via the modulation of the immune system. The nuclear hormone activates the transcription factor vitamin D receptor that affects, via fine-tuning of the epigenome, the transcription of >1000 human genes. In this review, we discuss that changes in the epigenome, in particular in immune cells, may be central for the clinical manifestation of FA. These epigenetic changes can be modulated by vitamin D suggesting that the individual FA patient's vitamin D status and responsiveness are of critical importance for disease progression.","['Velleuer, Eunike', 'Carlberg, Carsten']","['Velleuer E', 'Carlberg C']","[""Children's Hospital Neuwerk, D-41066 Monchengladbach, Germany."", 'Department for Cytopathology, Heinrich-Heine-University Dusseldorf, D-40225 Dusseldorf, Germany.', 'Institute of Biomedicine, University of Eastern Finland, FI-70211 Kuopio, Finland.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200509,Switzerland,Nutrients,Nutrients,101521595,"['0 (Receptors, Calcitriol)', '0 (VDR protein, human)', '1406-16-2 (Vitamin D)', '66772-14-3 (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Cell Differentiation', 'DNA Repair/genetics', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Fanconi Anemia/*genetics/*immunology/pathology', 'Humans', 'Immune System/*immunology', '*Immunomodulation', 'Mutation', 'Receptors, Calcitriol/genetics/immunology', 'Vitamin D/analogs & derivatives/*immunology']",PMC7285109,['NOTNLM'],"['Fanconi anemia', 'cancer', 'epigenetics', 'immunology', 'prevention', 'vitamin D']",2020/05/14 06:00,2021/02/17 06:00,['2020/05/14 06:00'],"['2020/04/06 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/02 00:00 [revised]', '2020/05/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/05/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/17 06:00 [medline]']","['nu12051355 [pii]', '10.3390/nu12051355 [doi]']",epublish,Nutrients. 2020 May 9;12(5). pii: nu12051355. doi: 10.3390/nu12051355.,"['ORCID: 0000-0003-4328-9556', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2633-0684']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Calcium is accumulated in the ER by sarco/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPases (SERCA enzymes) that generate by active, ATP-dependent transport, a several thousand-fold calcium ion concentration gradient between the cytosol (low nanomolar) and the ER lumen (high micromolar). SERCA enzymes are coded by three genes that by alternative splicing give rise to several isoforms, which can display isoform-specific calcium transport characteristics. SERCA expression levels and isoenzyme composition vary according to cell type, and this constitutes a mechanism whereby ER calcium homeostasis is adapted to the signaling and metabolic needs of the cell, depending on its phenotype, its state of activation and differentiation. As reviewed here, in several normal epithelial cell types including bronchial, mammary, gastric, colonic and choroid plexus epithelium, as well as in mature cells of hematopoietic origin such as pumps are simultaneously expressed, whereas in corresponding tumors and leukemias SERCA3 expression is selectively down-regulated. SERCA3 expression is restored during the pharmacologically induced differentiation of various cancer and leukemia cell types. SERCA3 is a useful marker for the study of cell differentiation, and the loss of SERCA3 expression constitutes a previously unrecognized example of the remodeling of calcium homeostasis in tumors.","['Papp, Bela', 'Launay, Sophie', 'Gelebart, Pascal', 'Arbabian, Atousa', 'Enyedi, Agnes', 'Brouland, Jean-Philippe', 'Carosella, Edgardo D', 'Adle-Biassette, Homa']","['Papp B', 'Launay S', 'Gelebart P', 'Arbabian A', 'Enyedi A', 'Brouland JP', 'Carosella ED', 'Adle-Biassette H']","['Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale, UMR U976, Institut Saint-Louis, 75010 Paris, France.', 'Institut de Recherche Saint-Louis, Hopital Saint-Louis, Universite de Paris, 75010 Paris, France.', 'CEA, DRF-Institut Francois Jacob, Department of Hemato-Immunology Research, Hopital Saint-Louis, 75010 Paris, France.', 'EA481, UFR Sante, Universite de Bourgogne Franche-Comte, 25000 Besancon, France.', 'Department of Clinical Science-Hematology Section, Haukeland University Hospital, University of Bergen, 5021 Bergen, Norway.', ""Laboratoire d'Innovation Vaccins, Institut Pasteur de Paris, 75015 Paris, France."", 'Second Department of Pathology, Semmelweis University, 1091 Budapest, Hungary.', 'Institut Universitaire de Pathologie, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois, 1011 Lausanne, Switzerland.', 'CEA, DRF-Institut Francois Jacob, Department of Hemato-Immunology Research, Hopital Saint-Louis, 75010 Paris, France.', ""AP-HP, Service d'Anatomie et Cytologie Pathologiques, Hopital Lariboisiere, 75010 Paris, France."", 'Universite de Paris, NeuroDiderot, Inserm UMR 1141, 75019 Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['3383, 4004, 5952, 9533/Fondation ARC pour la Recherche sur le Cancer']","['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200509,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', 'EC 3.6.3.8 (Sarcoplasmic Reticulum Calcium-Transporting ATPases)', 'EC 7.2.2.10 (ATP2A3 protein, human)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis', 'Breast Neoplasms/enzymology', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Calcium Signaling', 'Carcinoma/enzymology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Choroid Plexus Neoplasms/enzymology', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum/*metabolism', 'Gastrointestinal Neoplasms/enzymology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Homeostasis', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/metabolism', 'Lung Neoplasms/enzymology', 'Megakaryocytes/cytology/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Neoplasms/*metabolism', 'Organ Specificity', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/metabolism', 'Sarcoplasmic Reticulum Calcium-Transporting ATPases/analysis/genetics/*metabolism']",PMC7247589,['NOTNLM'],"['SERCA', 'calcium signaling', 'cancer', 'differentiation', 'endoplasmic reticulum', 'ion transport', 'leukemia']",2020/05/14 06:00,2021/02/17 06:00,['2020/05/14 06:00'],"['2020/02/24 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/01 00:00 [revised]', '2020/05/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/05/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/17 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms21093351 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms21093351 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2020 May 9;21(9). pii: ijms21093351. doi: 10.3390/ijms21093351.,"['ORCID: 0000-0003-2434-8987', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7366-9376', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3475-0101']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Resistance to available AML drugs requires the identification of new targets and agents. Hsp90 is one of the emerging important targets in AML, which has a central role in the regulation of apoptosis and cell proliferation through client proteins including the growth factor receptors and cyclin dependent kinases. The objective of the first part of this study is to investigate the putative Hsp90 inhibition activity of three novel previously synthesized quinazolines, which showed HL60 cytotoxicity and VEGFR2 and EGFR kinases inhibition activities. Using surface plasmon resonance, compound 1 (HAA2020) showed better Hsp90 inhibition compared to 17-AAG, and a docking study revealed that it fits nicely into the ATPase site. The objective of the second part is to maximize the anti-leukemic activity of HAA2020, which was combined with each of the eleven standard inhibitors. The best resulting synergistic effect in HL60 cells was with the pan cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) inhibitor dinaciclib, using an MTT assay. Furthermore, the inhibiting effect of the Hsp90alpha gene by the combination of HAA2020 and dinaciclib was associated with increased caspase-7 and TNF-alpha, leading to apoptosis in HL60 cells. In addition, the combination upregulated p27 simultaneously with the inhibition of cyclinD3 and CDK2, leading to abolished HL60 proliferation and survival. The actions of HAA2020 propagated the apoptotic and cell cycle control properties of dinaciclib, showing the importance of co-targeting Hsp90 and CDK, which could lead to the better management of leukemia.","['Abdalla, Ashraf N', 'Abdallah, Mohamed E', 'Aslam, Akhmed', 'Bader, Ammar', 'Vassallo, Antonio', 'Tommasi, Nunziatina De', 'Malki, Waleed H', 'Gouda, Ahmed M', 'Mukhtar, Mohammed H', 'El-Readi, Mahmoud Zaki', 'Alkahtani, Hamad M', 'Abdel-Aziz, Alaa A-M', 'El-Azab, Adel S']","['Abdalla AN', 'Abdallah ME', 'Aslam A', 'Bader A', 'Vassallo A', 'Tommasi N', 'Malki WH', 'Gouda AM', 'Mukhtar MH', 'El-Readi MZ', 'Alkahtani HM', 'Abdel-Aziz AA', 'El-Azab AS']","['College of Pharmacy, Umm Al-Qura University, Makkah 21955, Saudi Arabia.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Umm Al-Qura University, Makkah 21955, Saudi Arabia.', 'Faculty of Applied Medical Sciences, Umm Al-Qura University, Makkah 21955, Saudi Arabia.', 'College of Pharmacy, Umm Al-Qura University, Makkah 21955, Saudi Arabia.', 'Dipartimento di Scienze, Universita Degli Studi della Basilicata, 85100 Potenza, Italy.', 'Dipartimento di Farmacia, Universita Degli Studi di Salerno, 84084 Fisciano (SA), Italy.', 'College of Pharmacy, Umm Al-Qura University, Makkah 21955, Saudi Arabia.', 'Faculty of Pharmacy, Beni-Suef University, Beni-Suef 62514, Egypt.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Umm Al-Qura University, Makkah 21955, Saudi Arabia.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Umm Al-Qura University, Makkah 21955, Saudi Arabia.', 'Faculty of Pharmacy, Al-Azhar University, Assiut, 71524, Egypt.', 'College of Pharmacy, King Saud University, Riyadh 11451, Saudi Arabia.', 'College of Pharmacy, King Saud University, Riyadh 11451, Saudi Arabia.', 'College of Pharmacy, King Saud University, Riyadh 11451, Saudi Arabia.']",['eng'],"['15-MED-3-1-0060/Deanship of Scientific Research, Umm Al-Qura University']",['Journal Article'],20200508,Switzerland,Molecules,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",100964009,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cyclic N-Oxides)', '0 (HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Indolizines)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyridinium Compounds)', '4V8ECV0NBQ (dinaciclib)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cyclic N-Oxides/agonists/*pharmacology', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Drug Synergism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Indolizines/agonists/*pharmacology', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Pyridinium Compounds/agonists/*pharmacology']",PMC7248782,['NOTNLM'],"['Hsp90', 'acute myeloid leukemia (AML)', 'cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK)', 'dinaciclib']",2020/05/14 06:00,2021/02/10 06:00,['2020/05/14 06:00'],"['2020/04/15 00:00 [received]', '2020/04/29 00:00 [revised]', '2020/05/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/05/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/10 06:00 [medline]']","['molecules25092220 [pii]', '10.3390/molecules25092220 [doi]']",epublish,Molecules. 2020 May 8;25(9). pii: molecules25092220. doi: 10.3390/molecules25092220.,"['ORCID: 0000-0003-4770-9319', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7937-3309', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1707-4156', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6983-8587', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3362-9337', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7197-1515']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The activation of this receptor is dependent on signals derived from other receptors (inside-out signaling) with the crucial involvement of the Rap1-RIAM-Talin-1 pathway. Here, we analyze the implication of RIAM and its binding partner VASP in the signaling events occurring downstream of beta2 integrins (outside-in) during complement-mediated phagocytosis. To this end, we used HL-60 promyelocytic cell lines deficient in RIAM or VASP or overexpressing EGFP-tagged VASP to determine VASP dynamics at phagocytic cups. Our results indicate that RIAM-deficient HL-60 cells presented impaired particle internalization and altered integrin downstream signaling during complement-dependent phagocytosis. Similarly, VASP deficiency completely blocked phagocytosis, while VASP overexpression increased the random movement of phagocytic particles at the cell surface, with reduced internalization. Moreover, the recruitment of VASP to particle contact sites, amount of pSer157-VASP and formation of actin-rich phagocytic cups were dependent on RIAM expression. Our results suggested that RIAM worked as a relay for integrin complement receptors in outside-in signaling, coordinating integrin activation and cytoskeletal rearrangements via its interaction with VASP.","['Torres-Gomez, Alvaro', 'Sanchez-Trincado, Jose Luis', 'Toribio, Victor', 'Torres-Ruiz, Raul', 'Rodriguez-Perales, Sandra', 'Yanez-Mo, Maria', 'Reche, Pedro A', 'Cabanas, Carlos', 'Lafuente, Esther M']","['Torres-Gomez A', 'Sanchez-Trincado JL', 'Toribio V', 'Torres-Ruiz R', 'Rodriguez-Perales S', 'Yanez-Mo M', 'Reche PA', 'Cabanas C', 'Lafuente EM']","['Department of Immunology, Ophthalmology and Otorhinolaryngology, School of Medicine, Universidad Complutense de Madrid, and Instituto (I+12), 28040 Madrid, Spain.', 'Department of Immunology, Ophthalmology and Otorhinolaryngology, School of Medicine, Universidad Complutense de Madrid, and Instituto (I+12), 28040 Madrid, Spain.', 'Severo Ochoa Center for Molecular Biology (CSIC-UAM), 28049 Madrid, Spain.', 'Departamento de Biologia Molecular, Universidad Autonoma de Madrid (UAM) and Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria La Princesa (IIS-IP), 28049 Madrid, Spain.', 'Molecular Cytogenetics and Genome Editing Unit, Human Cancer Genetics Program, Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Oncologicas (CNIO), 28029 Madrid, Spain.', 'Josep Carreras Leukemia Research Institute and Department of Biomedicine, School of Medicine, University of Barcelona, 08007 Barcelona, Spain.', 'Molecular Cytogenetics and Genome Editing Unit, Human Cancer Genetics Program, Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Oncologicas (CNIO), 28029 Madrid, Spain.', 'Severo Ochoa Center for Molecular Biology (CSIC-UAM), 28049 Madrid, Spain.', 'Departamento de Biologia Molecular, Universidad Autonoma de Madrid (UAM) and Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria La Princesa (IIS-IP), 28049 Madrid, Spain.', 'Department of Immunology, Ophthalmology and Otorhinolaryngology, School of Medicine, Universidad Complutense de Madrid, and Instituto (I+12), 28040 Madrid, Spain.', 'Department of Immunology, Ophthalmology and Otorhinolaryngology, School of Medicine, Universidad Complutense de Madrid, and Instituto (I+12), 28040 Madrid, Spain.', 'Severo Ochoa Center for Molecular Biology (CSIC-UAM), 28049 Madrid, Spain.', 'Department of Immunology, Ophthalmology and Otorhinolaryngology, School of Medicine, Universidad Complutense de Madrid, and Instituto (I+12), 28040 Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200508,Switzerland,Cells,Cells,101600052,"['0 (APBB1IP protein, human)', '0 (Actins)', '0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Integrins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Microfilament Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, Complement)', '0 (vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein)', '42Z2K6ZL8P (Manganese)', '9007-36-7 (Complement System Proteins)']",IM,"['Actins/metabolism', 'Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/*metabolism', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/*metabolism', 'Cell Membrane/drug effects/metabolism', 'Complement System Proteins/metabolism', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Integrins/*metabolism', 'Manganese/pharmacology', 'Membrane Proteins/*metabolism', 'Microfilament Proteins/*metabolism', '*Phagocytosis/drug effects', 'Phosphoproteins/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Receptors, Complement/*metabolism', '*Signal Transduction/drug effects']",PMC7291270,['NOTNLM'],"['*CR3', '*CR4', '*Mac-1', '*RIAM', '*VASP', '*complement', '*outside-in', '*phagocytosis', '*beta2 integrins']",2020/05/14 06:00,2021/02/24 06:00,['2020/05/14 06:00'],"['2020/04/01 00:00 [received]', '2020/04/27 00:00 [revised]', '2020/05/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/05/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/24 06:00 [medline]']","['cells9051166 [pii]', '10.3390/cells9051166 [doi]']",epublish,Cells. 2020 May 8;9(5). pii: cells9051166. doi: 10.3390/cells9051166.,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-7377-1581', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7484-2866', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8767-060X', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8466-1022']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: A cohort of 126 patients diagnosed with T-ALL from 2008 to 2014 in West China Hospital, Sichuan University were enrolled in this study. They were further categorized by immunophenotype according to the expression of T-cell lineage markers CD1a, CD8, CD5 and one or more stem cell or myeloid markers. The laboratory indicators and prognosis factors were also statistically analyzed. Results: Of all patients, the ratio of male to female was 2.5ratio1, with the median age of 25 years old (range 14 to 77) . The percentage of ETP-ALL was up to 47.6%. T-ALL patients showed higher ratio in first clinical remission rate (CR(1)) than T-LBL ones (64.4% vs 30.8%, P=0.032) .

Methods: Data of newly diagnosed adults with Ph(-) ALL in high-risk who achieved CR were reviewed. Variables associated with outcome were identified by COX regression model and Landmark analysis. Results: A total of 177 patients, 99 (56%) cases male with a median age of 40 years (range, 16-65 years) were included in this study. Of them, 95 (54%) patients received allo-HSCT in CR(1). Multivariate analyses showed that MRD negativity after the first cycle of consolidation (HR=0.52, 95%CI 0.30-0.89, P=0.017) and achieving CR within 4 weeks (HR=0.43, 95%CI 0.24-0.79, P=0.006) were the factors significantly-associated with longer DFS, and allo-HSCT was associated with both longer DFS (HR=0.13, 95%CI 0.08-0.22, P<0.001) and OS (HR=0.24, 95%CI 0.15-0.41, P<0.001) .

Methods: We retrospectively analyzed Ph(+) CML patients who developed CCA/Ph(-) during TKI-therapy from May 2001 to December 2017. Results: Data of CCA/Ph(-) 63 patients, including 7 progressing to Ph(-) MDS/AML and 56 remaining disease stable were collected. Compared with those with stable disease, patients with Ph(-)MDS/AML had lower hemoglobin (P=0.007) and platelet (P=0.006) counts, and higher proportion of peripheral blasts (P<0.001) when the first time CCA/Ph(-) was detected, and more mosonomy 7 abnormality (5/7, 71.4%) when MDS or AML was diagnosed; meanwhile, trisomy 8 (32/56, 57.1%) was more common in those with stable disease. Outcome of the patients with Ph(-) MDS/AML were poor. However, most of those with CCA/Ph(-) and stable disease had optimal response on TKI-therapy. Conclusions: A few patients with Ph(+) CML developed CCA/Ph(-) during TKI-therapy, most of them had stable disease, but very few patients developed Ph(-) MDS/AML with more common occurrence of monosomy 7 or unknown cytopenia.

Despite initially responding to FLT3 inhibitors, most patients eventually relapse with drug resistance. The mechanism by which resistance arises and the initial response to drug treatment that promotes cell survival is unknown. Recent studies show that a transiently maintained subpopulation of drug-sensitive cells, so-called drug-tolerant ""persisters"" (DTPs), can survive cytotoxic drug exposure despite lacking resistance-conferring mutations. Using RNA sequencing and drug screening, we find that treatment of FLT3 internal tandem duplication AML cells with quizartinib, a selective FLT3 inhibitor, upregulates inflammatory genes in DTPs and thereby confers susceptibility to anti-inflammatory glucocorticoids (GCs). Mechanistically, the combination of FLT3 inhibitors and GCs enhances cell death of FLT3 mutant, but not wild-type, cells through GC-receptor-dependent upregulation of the proapoptotic protein BIM and proteasomal degradation of the antiapoptotic protein MCL-1. Moreover, the enhanced antileukemic activity by quizartinib and dexamethasone combination has been validated using primary AML patient samples and xenograft mouse models. Collectively, our study indicates that the combination of FLT3 inhibitors and GCs has the potential to eliminate DTPs and therefore prevent minimal residual disease, mutational drug resistance, and relapse in FLT3-mutant AML.","['Gebru, Melat T', 'Atkinson, Jennifer M', 'Young, Megan M', 'Zhang, Lijun', 'Tang, Zhenyuan', 'Liu, Zhenqiu', 'Lu, Pinyi', 'Dower, Christopher M', 'Chen, Longgui', 'Annageldiyev, Charyguly', 'Sharma, Arati', 'Imamura Kawasawa, Yuka', 'Zhao, Zhongming', 'Miller, Barbara A', 'Claxton, David F', 'Wang, Hong-Gang']","['Gebru MT', 'Atkinson JM', 'Young MM', 'Zhang L', 'Tang Z', 'Liu Z', 'Lu P', 'Dower CM', 'Chen L', 'Annageldiyev C', 'Sharma A', 'Imamura Kawasawa Y', 'Zhao Z', 'Miller BA', 'Claxton DF', 'Wang HG']","['Department of Pediatrics.', 'Department of Pediatrics.', 'Department of Pediatrics.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.', 'Institute for Personalized Medicine.', 'Department of Pediatrics.', 'Department of Public Health Sciences, Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine, Hershey, PA.', 'Center for Precision Health, School of Biomedical Informatics, The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, Houston, TX; and.', 'Department of Pediatrics.', 'Department of Pediatrics.', 'Department of Medicine, and.', 'Department of Pharmacology.', 'Department of Pharmacology.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.', 'Institute for Personalized Medicine.', 'Center for Precision Health, School of Biomedical Informatics, The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, Houston, TX; and.', 'The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center UTHealth Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Pediatrics.', 'Department of Medicine, and.', 'Department of Pediatrics.', 'Department of Pharmacology.']",['eng'],"['P01 CA171983/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA222349/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (Benzothiazoles)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Phenylurea Compounds)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '7LA4O6Q0D3 (quizartinib)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Flt3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Benzothiazoles/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Computer Simulation', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Synergism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Glucocorticoids/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Inflammation/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Phenylurea Compounds/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Selection, Genetic', 'Transcriptome', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics']",PMC7453151,,,2020/05/13 06:00,2021/03/18 06:00,['2020/05/13 06:00'],"['2019/08/28 00:00 [received]', '2020/04/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/18 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/13 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)61762-1 [pii]', '10.1182/blood.2019003124 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2020 Aug 27;136(9):1067-1079. doi: 10.1182/blood.2019003124.,,,['(c) 2020 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A frequent feature of high-risk B-ALL is loss of function of the IKAROS (encoded by the IKZF1 gene) tumor suppressor. Here, we report that IKAROS regulates expression of the BCL2L1 gene (encodes the BCL-XL protein) in human B-ALL. Gain-of-function and loss-of-function experiments demonstrate that IKAROS binds to the BCL2L1 promoter, recruits histone deacetylase HDAC1, and represses BCL2L1 expression via chromatin remodeling. In leukemia, IKAROS' function is impaired by oncogenic casein kinase II (CK2), which is overexpressed in B-ALL. Phosphorylation by CK2 reduces IKAROS binding and recruitment of HDAC1 to the BCL2L1 promoter. This results in a loss of IKAROS-mediated repression of BCL2L1 and increased expression of BCL-XL. Increased expression of BCL-XL and/or CK2, as well as reduced IKAROS expression, are associated with resistance to doxorubicin treatment. Molecular and pharmacological inhibition of CK2 with a specific inhibitor CX-4945, increases binding of IKAROS to the BCL2L1 promoter and enhances IKAROS-mediated repression of BCL2L1 in B-ALL. Treatment with CX-4945 increases sensitivity to doxorubicin in B-ALL, and reverses resistance to doxorubicin in multidrug-resistant B-ALL. Combination treatment with CX-4945 and doxorubicin show synergistic therapeutic effects in vitro and in preclinical models of high-risk B-ALL. Results reveal a novel signaling network that regulates chemoresistance in leukemia. These data lay the groundwork for clinical testing of a rationally designed, targeted therapy that combines the CK2 inhibitor, CX-4945, with doxorubicin for the treatment of hematopoietic malignancies.","['Song, Chunhua', 'Ge, Zheng', 'Ding, Yali', 'Tan, Bi-Hua', 'Desai, Dhimant', 'Gowda, Krishne', 'Amin, Shantu', 'Gowda, Raghavendra', 'Robertson, Gavin P', 'Yue, Feng', 'Huang, Suming', 'Spiegelman, Vladimir', 'Payne, Jonathon L', 'Reeves, Mark E', 'Gurel, Zafer', 'Iyer, Soumya', 'Dhanyamraju, Pavan Kumar', 'Xiang, Meixian', 'Kawasawa, Yuka Imamura', 'Cury, Nathalia M', 'Yunes, Jose Andres', 'McGrath, Mary', 'Schramm, Joe', 'Su, Ruijun', 'Yang, Yiping', 'Zhao, Zhijun', 'Lyu, Xiaoguang', 'Muschen, Markus', 'Payne, Kimberly J', 'Gowda, Chandrika', 'Dovat, Sinisa']","['Song C', 'Ge Z', 'Ding Y', 'Tan BH', 'Desai D', 'Gowda K', 'Amin S', 'Gowda R', 'Robertson GP', 'Yue F', 'Huang S', 'Spiegelman V', 'Payne JL', 'Reeves ME', 'Gurel Z', 'Iyer S', 'Dhanyamraju PK', 'Xiang M', 'Kawasawa YI', 'Cury NM', 'Yunes JA', 'McGrath M', 'Schramm J', 'Su R', 'Yang Y', 'Zhao Z', 'Lyu X', 'Muschen M', 'Payne KJ', 'Gowda C', 'Dovat S']","['Department of Pediatrics, Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine, Hershey, PA.', 'Department of Medicine, Ohio State University College of Medicine, Columbus, OH.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Zhongda Hospital, Medical School of Southeast University, Nanjing, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine, Hershey, PA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine, Hershey, PA.', 'Department of Pharmacology and.', 'Department of Pharmacology and.', 'Department of Pharmacology and.', 'Department of Pharmacology and.', 'Department of Pharmacology and.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine, Hershey, PA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine, Hershey, PA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine, Hershey, PA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine, Hershey, PA.', 'Department of Basic Sciences and.', 'Department of Surgery, Loma Linda University College of Medicine, Loma Linda, CA.', 'Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine, Hershey, PA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine, Hershey, PA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine, Hershey, PA.', 'School of Pharmaceutical Science, South-Central University for Nationalities, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine, Hershey, PA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine, Hershey, PA.', 'Graduate Program in Genetics and Molecular Biology, State University of Campinas, Campinas Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Laboratorio de Biologia Molecular, Centro Infantil Boldrini, Campinas, Brazil.', 'Department of Molecular Biology, Centro Infantil Boldrini, State University of Campinas, Campinas, Brazil.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine, Hershey, PA.', 'Department of Pathology and Human Anatomy, Loma Linda University College of Medicine, Loma Linda, CA.', 'Department of Medicine, Ohio State University College of Medicine, Columbus, OH.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine, Hershey, PA.', 'General Hospital of Ningxia Medical University, Yingchuan, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine, Hershey, PA.', 'Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China;

We included 6028 patients (median age, 6 years; interquartile range, 1-11; range, <1 to 20) from the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (1995-2012) registry. Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) in 2-year survivors and standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) were calculated to compare mortality and SN rates with expected rates in the general population. Median follow-up of survivors was 7.8 years. Diagnoses included severe aplastic anemia (SAA; 24%), Fanconi anemia (FA; 10%), other marrow failure (6%), hemoglobinopathy (15%), immunodeficiency (23%), and metabolic/leukodystrophy syndrome (22%). Ten-year survival was 93% (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 92% to 94%; SMR, 4.2; 95% CI, 3.7-4.8). Seventy-one patients developed SNs (1.2%). Incidence was highest in FA (5.5%), SAA (1.1%), and other marrow failure syndromes (1.7%); for other NMDs, incidence was <1%. Hematologic (27%), oropharyngeal (25%), and skin cancers (13%) were most common. Leukemia risk was highest in the first 5 years posttransplantation; oropharyngeal, skin, liver, and thyroid tumors primarily occurred after 5 years. Despite a low number of SNs, patients had an 11-fold increased SN risk (SIR, 11; 95% CI, 8.9-13.9) compared with the general population. We report excellent long-term survival and low SN incidence in an international cohort of children undergoing HCT for NMDs. The risk of SN development was highest in patients with FA and marrow failure syndromes, highlighting the need for long-term posttransplantation surveillance in this population.","['Kahn, Justine M',

Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis was posttransplant cyclophosphamide (PTCy), calcineurin inhibitor (CNI), and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) for haploidentical, and CNI with MMF or methotrexate with/without antithymoglobulin for MUDs. Haploidentical recipients were matched (1:2 ratio) with MUD controls for sex, conditioning intensity, disease stage, Philadelphia-chromosome status, and cytogenetic risk. In the myeloablative setting, day +28 neutrophil recovery was similar between haploidentical (87%) and MUD (88%) (P = .11). Corresponding rates after reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) were 84% and 88% (P = .47). The 3-month incidence of grade II-IV acute GVHD (aGVHD) and 3-year chronic GVHD (cGVHD) was similar after haploidentical compared with MUD: myeloablative conditioning, 33% vs 34% (P = .46) for aGVHD and 29% vs 31% for cGVHD (P = .58); RIC, 31% vs 30% (P = .06) for aGVHD and 24% vs 29% for cGVHD (P = .86). Among patients receiving myeloablative regimens, 3-year probabilities of overall survival were 44% and 51% with haploidentical and MUD (P = .56). Corresponding rates after RIC were 43% and 42% (P = .6). In this large multicenter case-matched retrospective analysis, despite the limitations of a registry-based study (ie, unavailability of key elements such as minimal residual disease testing), our analysis indicated that outcomes of patients with ALL undergoing HCT from a haploidentical donor were comparable with 8 of 8 MUD transplantations.","['Al Malki, Monzr M', 'Yang, Dongyun', 'Labopin, Myriam', 'Afanasyev, Boris', 'Angelucci, Emanuele', 'Bashey, Asad', 'Socie, Gerard', 'Karduss-Urueta, Amado', 'Helbig, Grzegorz', 'Bornhauser, Martin', 'Niittyvuopio, Riitta', 'Ganser, Arnold', 'Ciceri, Fabio', 'Brecht, Arne', 'Koc, Yener', 'Bejanyan, Nelli', 'Ferraro, Francesca', 'Kebriaei, Partow', 'Mokhtari, Sally', 'Ghobadi, Armin', 'Nakamura, Ryotaro', 'Forman, Stephen J', 'Champlin, Richard', 'Mohty, Mohamad', 'Ciurea, Stefan O', 'Nagler, Arnon']","['Al Malki MM', 'Yang D', 'Labopin M', 'Afanasyev B', 'Angelucci E', 'Bashey A', 'Socie G', 'Karduss-Urueta A', 'Helbig G', 'Bornhauser M', 'Niittyvuopio R', 'Ganser A', 'Ciceri F', 'Brecht A', 'Koc Y', 'Bejanyan N', 'Ferraro F', 'Kebriaei P', 'Mokhtari S', 'Ghobadi A', 'Nakamura R', 'Forman SJ', 'Champlin R', 'Mohty M', 'Ciurea SO', 'Nagler A']","['Department of Hematology and Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation and.', 'Department of Computational Quantitative Medicine-Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, CA.', 'Department of Hematology, European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) Paris Study Office/Centros de Referencia em Saude do Trabalhador, Hopital Saint Antoine, INSERM, Paris, France.', 'Raisa Gorbacheva Memorial Institute of Children Oncology, Hematology and Transplantation, St. Petersburg, Russia.', 'Ematologia e Centro Trapianti, Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, Genoa, Italy.', 'The Blood and Marrow Transplant Program, Northside Hospital, Atlanta, GA.', 'Department of Hematology-Bone Marrow Transplantation (BMT), Hospital St. Louis, Paris, France.', 'Bone Marrow Transplant Program, Instituto de Cancerologia-Clinica Las Americas, Medellin, Colombia.', 'Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, School of Medicine in Katowice, Medical University of Silesia, Katowice, Poland.', 'University Hospital Carl Gustav Carus, Technische Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'Stem Cell Transplantation Unit, Comprehensive Cancer Center, Helsinki University Hospital, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology, and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Hematology and BMT Unit, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.', 'Helios Dr. Horst Schmidt Kliniken Wiesbaden, Wiesbaden, Germany.', 'Stem Cell Transplant Unit, Medical Park Hospitals, Antalya, Turkey.', 'Division of Hematology, Oncology and Transplantation, University of Minnesota Medical Center, Minneapolis, MN.', 'Division of Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, School of Medicine, Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, MO.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Clinical Translational Project Development, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, CA.', 'Division of Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, School of Medicine, Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, MO.', 'Department of Hematology and Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation and.', 'Department of Hematology and Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation and.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Hematology, European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) Paris Study Office/Centros de Referencia em Saude do Trabalhador, Hopital Saint Antoine, INSERM, Paris, France.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Hematology, European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) Paris Study Office/Centros de Referencia em Saude do Trabalhador, Hopital Saint Antoine, INSERM, Paris, France.', 'Hematology Division, BMT Department, Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel Hashomer, Israel;

This first-in-human, open-label, dose-escalation study to evaluate the safety, maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and preliminary efficacy of CWP291 enrolled 69 patients with hematologic malignancies (acute myeloid leukemia [AML], n = 64; myelodysplastic syndrome, n = 5) in 15 dose-escalation cohorts of 4 to 334 mg/m2 using a modified 3+3 design and 1 dose-expansion cohort. CWP291 was administered IV daily for 7 days every 21 days. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were nausea (n = 44, 64%), vomiting (n = 32, 46%), diarrhea (n = 25, 36%), and infusion-related reactions (n = 20, 29%).

We assessed the ATL incidence rate among HTLV-1 infected women in a prospective cohort in French Guiana. This is the first prospective study to assess the ATL incidence rate in an area of South America where HTLV-1 prevalence is high. Patients were enrolled between 1991 and 2005, and follow-up continued until April 2018. In the general hospital in Saint-Laurent-du-Maroni, 307 pregnant women were diagnosed with HTLV-1 infection, and 268 of them were observed for a median of 16.7 years. During follow-up, 9 ATL incident cases occurred resulting in an ATL incidence rate of 2.03 per 1000 HTLV-1 carrier-years (95% confidence interval, 0.93-3.85 per 1000 HTLV-1 carrier-years). The median age at diagnosis was 47.4 years, and median survival from diagnosis was low at 3.5 months. The ATL incidence rate was elevated for a study population consisting mostly of young people, which could either be a general feature in South America or could be specific to the Noir Marron population that constituted most of the cohort.","['Ramassamy, Jill-Lea', 'Tortevoye, Patricia', 'Ntab, Balthazar', 'Seve, Beatrice', 'Carles, Gabriel', 'Gaquiere, Dominique', 'Madec, Yoann', 'Fontanet, Arnaud', 'Gessain, Antoine']","['Ramassamy JL', 'Tortevoye P', 'Ntab B', 'Seve B', 'Carles G', 'Gaquiere D', 'Madec Y', 'Fontanet A', 'Gessain A']","[""Institut Pasteur, Unite d'Epidemiologie et Physiopathologie des Virus Oncogenes, Departement de Virologie, Unite Mixte de Recherche 3569, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Paris, France."", 'Universite de Paris, Paris, France.', ""Institut Pasteur, Unite d'Epidemiologie et Physiopathologie des Virus Oncogenes, Departement de Virologie, Unite Mixte de Recherche 3569, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Paris, France."", ""Departement de l'Information Medicale and."", ""Service de Gynecologie-Obstetrique, Centre Hospitalier de l'Ouest Guyanais, Franck Joly, Saint-Laurent-du-Maroni, French Guiana."", ""Service de Gynecologie-Obstetrique, Centre Hospitalier de l'Ouest Guyanais, Franck Joly, Saint-Laurent-du-Maroni, French Guiana."", 'Protection Maternelle et Infantile, Saint-Laurent-du-Maroni, French Guiana.', ""Institut Pasteur, Unite de Recherche et d'Expertise Epidemiologie des Maladies Emergentes, Paris, France; and."", ""Institut Pasteur, Unite de Recherche et d'Expertise Epidemiologie des Maladies Emergentes, Paris, France; and."", 'Conservatoire National des Arts et Metiers, Unite Associee Pasteur-Cnam Risques Infectieux et Emergents, Paris, France.', ""Institut Pasteur, Unite d'Epidemiologie et Physiopathologie des Virus Oncogenes, Departement de Virologie, Unite Mixte de Recherche 3569, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Paris, France.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Female', 'French Guiana/epidemiology', '*Human T-lymphotropic virus 1', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Japan', '*Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/diagnosis/epidemiology', 'Pregnancy', 'Prospective Studies']",PMC7218432,,,2020/05/13 06:00,2021/05/15 06:00,['2020/05/13 06:00'],"['2020/02/07 00:00 [received]', '2020/04/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/05/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/15 06:00 [medline]']","['S2473-9529(20)31336-7 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2020001628 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Adv. 2020 May 12;4(9):2044-2048. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2020001628.,,,['(c) 2020 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The recent irruption of 3D cultured cells termed organoids could render a better representation of the original tumour sample. However, every laboratory has its own protocol and tissue-provider to establish these cancer models, preventing further dissemination and validation of the obtained data. To address this problem, the Human Cancer Models Initiative (HCMI) has selected the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) to make available organoid models to the scientific community. In this regard, no epigenetic information is available for these samples and, overall, the DNA methylation profiles of human cancer organoids are largely unknown. Herein, we provide the DNA methylation landscape of 25 human cancer organoids available at the ATCC using a microarray that interrogates more than 850,000 CpG sites. We observed that the studied organoids retain the epigenetic setting of their original primary cancer type; that exhibit a DNA methylation landscape characteristic of transformed tissues excluding an overgrowth of normal-matched cells; and that are closer to the DNA methylation profiles of the corresponding primary tumours than to established 2D cell lines. Most importantly, the obtained DNA methylation results are freely available to everyone for further data mining. Thus, our findings support from the epigenetic standpoint that the ATCC human cancer organoids recapitulate many of the features of the disorder in the patient and are excellent tools to be shared among investigators for further tumour biology research.","['Joshi, Ricky', 'Castro De Moura, Manuel', 'Pineyro, David', 'Alvarez-Errico, Damiana', 'Arribas, Carles', 'Esteller, Manel']","['Joshi R', 'Castro De Moura M', 'Pineyro D', 'Alvarez-Errico D', 'Arribas C', 'Esteller M']","['Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute (IJC), Badalona , Barcelona, Spain.', 'Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute (IJC), Badalona , Barcelona, Spain.', 'Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute (IJC), Badalona , Barcelona, Spain.', 'Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute (IJC), Badalona , Barcelona, Spain.', 'Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute (IJC), Badalona , Barcelona, Spain.', 'Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute (IJC), Badalona , Barcelona, Spain.', 'Institucio Catalana de Recerca i Estudis Avancats (ICREA) , Barcelona, Spain.', 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red Cancer (CIBERONC) , Madrid, Spain.', 'Physiological Sciences Department, School of Medicine and Health Sciences, University of Barcelona (UB) , Barcelona, Spain.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Validation Study']",20200512,United States,Epigenetics,Epigenetics,101265293,,IM,"['Biological Specimen Banks/*standards', 'CpG Islands', 'DNA Methylation', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', '*Epigenome', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Organoids/*metabolism/pathology', 'Primary Cell Culture/methods/*standards', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",PMC7595613,['NOTNLM'],"['*DNA methylation', '*Organoids', '*cancer', '*cell lines', '*epigenetics', '*microarray', '*primary tumours', '*validation']",2020/05/13 06:00,2021/06/16 06:00,['2020/05/13 06:00'],"['2020/05/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/16 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/13 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/15592294.2020.1762398 [doi]'],ppublish,Epigenetics. 2020 Nov;15(11):1167-1177. doi: 10.1080/15592294.2020.1762398.

The optimal preventative strategy is unclear. Our objective is to determine the effects of low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) as primary VTE prophylaxis. A single-centred retrospective cohort study of adult patients with Philadelphia chromosome negative (Ph-) ALL who received ASNase-based intensification from 2001 to 2017, with prophylaxis given from 2011 to 2017. In all, 214 patients were included in this study with 99 in the historical control group and 125 in the prophylaxis group. The mean (range) enoxaparin dose was 0.79 (0.39-1.2) mg/kg. Of the 125 patients in the prophylaxis group 17 (13.6%) developed VTE during the intensification phase, while 27/99 patients (27.3%) in the control cohort experienced at least one thrombotic event (odds ratio [OR] 0.42, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.21-0.83). Overall, the main sites of VTE incidences included deep vein thrombosis in the lower extremity (54.6%), pulmonary embolism (13.6%) and catheter-related thrombosis (22.7%). In addition, we found that after adjusting for age, T-phenotype ALL was associated with VTE development (OR 3.07, 95% CI 1.04-9.08). There was no documented major bleeding in the prophylaxis group. LMWH prophylaxis reduced the incidence of symptomatic VTE in adult patients with ALL receiving intensification chemotherapy with ASNase.","['Sibai, Hassan', 'Chen, Ruiqi', 'Liu, Xing', 'Falcone, Umberto', 'Schimmer, Aaron', 'Schuh, Andre', 'Law, Arjun', 'McNamara, Caroline', 'Maze, Dawn', 'Yee, Karen', 'Minden, Mark', 'Chan, Steven M', 'Gupta, Vikas', 'Murphy, Tracy', 'Sakurai, Naoko', 'Atenafu, Eshetu G', 'Brandwein, Joseph M', 'Seki, Jack T']","['Sibai H', 'Chen R', 'Liu X', 'Falcone U', 'Schimmer A', 'Schuh A', 'Law A', 'McNamara C', 'Maze D', 'Yee K', 'Minden M', 'Chan SM', 'Gupta V', 'Murphy T', 'Sakurai N', 'Atenafu EG', 'Brandwein JM', 'Seki JT']","['Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Biostatistics, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Biostatistics, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Division of Hematology, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Leslie Dan Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",20200512,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Anticoagulants)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Anticoagulants/*administration & dosage', '*Asparaginase/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', '*Venous Thromboembolism/chemically induced/prevention & control']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*anticoagulation', '*thrombosis']",2020/05/13 06:00,2021/03/24 06:00,['2020/05/13 06:00'],"['2020/02/24 00:00 [received]', '2020/04/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/24 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/13 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/bjh.16695 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2020 Dec;191(5):748-754. doi: 10.1111/bjh.16695.

This study sought to determine if ex vivo exposure of human adipose arterioles to the BCR-ABL TKIs imatinib and nilotinib causes endothelial dysfunction. METHODS: Human adipose arterioles were incubated overnight in cell culture media containing vehicle (PBS), imatinib (10 micromol/L) or nilotinib (100 micromol/L). Arterioles were cannulated onto glass pipettes and flow mediated dilation (FMD) was assessed via video microscopy. To determine the mechanism of vasodilation, FMD was re-assessed in the presence of either the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor L-NAME (100 micromol/L) or the H2 O2 scavenger PEG-Catalase (500 U/mL). RESULTS: Neither imatinib nor nilotinib affected the magnitude of FMD (max dilation = 78+/-17% vehicle, 80 +/- 24% nilotinib, 73 +/- 13% imatinib). FMD was decreased by L-NAME in vehicle-treated arterioles (max dilation = 47+/-29%). Conversely, L-NAME had no effect on FMD in imatinib- or nilotinib-treated vessels (max dilation = 79+/-14% and 80 +/- 24%, respectively), rather FMD was inhibited by PEG-Catalase (max dilation = 29+/-11% and 29 +/- 14%, respectively). CONCLUSION: Incubating human arterioles with imatinib or nilotinib switches the mediator of FMD from vasoprotective nitric oxide to pro-inflammatory H2 O2 .","['Durand, Matthew J', 'Hader, Shelby N', 'Derayunan, Alexa', 'Zinkevich, Natalya', 'McIntosh, Jennifer J', 'Beyer, Andreas M']","['Durand MJ', 'Hader SN', 'Derayunan A', 'Zinkevich N', 'McIntosh JJ', 'Beyer AM']","['Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA.', 'Cardiovascular Center, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA.', 'Cardiovascular Center, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA.', 'Cardiovascular Center, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA.', 'Cardiovascular Center, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA.', 'Cardiovascular Center, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA.', 'Cardiovascular Center, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA.', 'Department of Physiology, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA.', 'Redox Biology Program, Cardiovascular Center and Cancer Center, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA.']",['eng'],"['K08 HL150340/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL133029/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL113612/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20200905,United States,Microcirculation,"Microcirculation (New York, N.Y. : 1994)",9434935,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cardiotonic Agents)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (catalase-polyethylene glycol)', '31C4KY9ESH (Nitric Oxide)', '3WJQ0SDW1A (Polyethylene Glycols)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'EC 1.11.1.6 (Catalase)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (Nitric Oxide Synthase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)', 'V55S2QJN2X (NG-Nitroarginine Methyl Ester)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects', 'Arterioles/drug effects/physiology', 'Cardiotonic Agents/pharmacology', 'Catalase/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/metabolism', 'Imatinib Mesylate/adverse effects', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/physiopathology', 'Male', 'Microvessels/*drug effects/*physiology', 'Middle Aged', 'NG-Nitroarginine Methyl Ester/pharmacology', 'Nitric Oxide/metabolism', 'Nitric Oxide Synthase/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Polyethylene Glycols/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*adverse effects', 'Pyrimidines/adverse effects', 'Vasodilation/*drug effects']",PMC7606774,['NOTNLM'],"['*chronic myelogenous leukemia', '*microcirculation', '*nitric Oxide', '*tyrosine kinase inhibitor', '*vasodilation']",2020/05/13 06:00,2021/10/01 06:00,['2020/05/13 06:00'],"['2020/02/27 00:00 [received]', '2020/04/09 00:00 [revised]', '2020/05/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/01 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/13 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/micc.12625 [doi]'],ppublish,Microcirculation. 2020 Oct;27(7):e12625. doi: 10.1111/micc.12625.

Methods: A prospective observational single-center study was performed between July 2011 and July 2016. Consecutive episodes of pulmonary infiltrates were analyzed in subjects over 18 years of age who presented hematologic malignancies and underwent chemotherapy or stem cell transplantation. Results: Ninety-six episodes of pulmonary infiltrates were analyzed. Acute leukemia was the most frequent underlying condition. Thirty-seven patients (38.5%) received a stem cell transplant. Sixty-one (62.9%) were neutropenic at the moment of inclusion in the study. A definitive etiologic diagnosis was obtained in 41 cases (42.7%), where infection accounted for the vast majority of cases (33 cases, 80.5%). Definitive diagnosis was reached by non-invasive methods in 13 cases (13.5%). BAL was performed in 47 cases and led to a diagnosis in 40.4% of the cases. BAL results led to therapeutic changes in 27 cases (57.4%), including the addition of new antimicrobials to empiric treatments in 10. Regarding BAL's safety, two patients experienced minor adverse events and one a severe adverse event; no procedure-related deaths were observed. Conclusions: Infection was the leading cause of pulmonary infiltrates in patients with hematologic malignancies and stem cell transplantation. BAL was a useful decision-making diagnostic tool, with minor adverse events.","['Jorge, Laura', 'Torres, Diego', 'Languasco, Agustin', 'Rodriguez, Pablo', 'Bonvehi, Pablo', 'Temporiti, Elena', 'Relloso, Silvia', 'Videla, Cristina', 'Herrera, Fabian']","['Jorge L', 'Torres D', 'Languasco A', 'Rodriguez P', 'Bonvehi P', 'Temporiti E', 'Relloso S', 'Videla C', 'Herrera F']","['Division of Infectious Diseases, Centro de Educacion Medica e Investigaciones Clinicas ""Norberto Quirno"" (CEMIC), Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Division of Infectious Diseases, Centro de Educacion Medica e Investigaciones Clinicas ""Norberto Quirno"" (CEMIC), Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Department of Medicine, Centro de Educacion Medica e Investigaciones Clinicas ""Norberto Quirno"" (CEMIC), Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Pulmonary Medicine Section, Department of Medicine, Centro de Educacion Medica e Investigaciones Clinicas ""Norberto Quirno"" (CEMIC), Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Division of Infectious Diseases, Centro de Educacion Medica e Investigaciones Clinicas ""Norberto Quirno"" (CEMIC), Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Division of Infectious Diseases, Centro de Educacion Medica e Investigaciones Clinicas ""Norberto Quirno"" (CEMIC), Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Department of Microbiology, Centro de Educacion Medica e Investigaciones Clinicas ""Norberto Quirno"" (CEMIC), Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Clinical Virology Laboratory, Centro de Educacion Medica e Investigaciones Clinicas ""Norberto Quirno"" (CEMIC), Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Division of Infectious Diseases, Centro de Educacion Medica e Investigaciones Clinicas ""Norberto Quirno"" (CEMIC), Buenos Aires, Argentina.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200501,Italy,Mediterr J Hematol Infect Dis,Mediterranean journal of hematology and infectious diseases,101530512,,,,PMC7202335,['NOTNLM'],"['Bronchoalveolar lavage', 'Hematologic malignancy', 'Pulmonary infiltrate', 'Stem cell transplantation']",2020/05/13 06:00,2020/05/13 06:01,['2020/05/13 06:00'],"['2020/02/05 00:00 [received]', '2020/04/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/05/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/13 06:01 [medline]']","['10.4084/MJHID.2020.025 [doi]', 'mjhid-12-1-e2020025 [pii]']",epublish,Mediterr J Hematol Infect Dis. 2020 May 1;12(1):e2020025. doi: 10.4084/MJHID.2020.025. eCollection 2020.,,['Competing interests: The authors declare no conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The PML protein is a tumor suppressor that plays an important role by interacting with various proteins. Herein, we investigated the effect of the PML isoforms on oncostatin M (OSM)-induced signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT-3) transcriptional activity. PML influenced OSM-induced STAT-3 activity in a cell type-specific manner, which was dependent on the p53 status of the cells but regardless of PML isoform. Interestingly, overexpression of PML exerted opposite effects on OSM-induced STAT-3 activity in p53 wild-type and mutant cells. Specifically, overexpression of PML in the cell lines bearing wild-type p53 (NIH3T3 and U87-MG cells) decreased OSM-induced STAT-3 transcriptional activity, whereas overexpression of PML increased OSM-induced STAT-3 transcriptional activity in mutant p53-bearing cell lines (HEK293T and U251-MG cells). When wild-type p53 cells were co-transfected with PML-IV and R273H-p53 mutant, OSM-mediated STAT-3 transcriptional activity was significantly enhanced, compared to that of cells which were transfected with PML-IV alone; however, when cells bearing mutant p53 were co-transfected with PML-IV and wild-type p53, OSM-induced STAT-3 transcriptional activity was significantly decreased, compared to that of transfected cells with PML-IV alone. In conclusion, PML acts together with wild-type or mutant p53 and influences OSM-mediated STAT-3 activity in a negative or positive manner, resulting in the aberrant activation of STAT-3 in cancer cells bearing mutant p53 probably might occur through the interaction of mutant p53 with PML.","['Lim, Jiwoo', 'Choi, Ji Ha', 'Park, Eun-Mi', 'Choi, Youn-Hee']","['Lim J', 'Choi JH', 'Park EM', 'Choi YH']","['Departments of Physiology, Ewha Womans University College of Medicine, Seoul 07804, Korea.', 'Departments of Pharmacology, Ewha Womans University College of Medicine, Seoul 07804, Korea.', 'Departments of Pharmacology, Ewha Womans University College of Medicine, Seoul 07804, Korea.', 'Departments of Physiology, Ewha Womans University College of Medicine, Seoul 07804, Korea.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Korea (South),Korean J Physiol Pharmacol,The Korean journal of physiology & pharmacology : official journal of the Korean Physiological Society and the Korean Society of Pharmacology,9709505,,,,PMC7193908,['NOTNLM'],"['Promyelocytic leukemia', 'Signal transducer and activator of transcription-3', 'Transcriptional activity', 'p53']",2020/05/13 06:00,2020/05/13 06:01,['2020/05/13 06:00'],"['2019/08/07 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/22 00:00 [revised]', '2020/02/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/05/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/13 06:01 [medline]']","['10.4196/kjpp.2020.24.3.203 [doi]', 'KJPP-24-203 [pii]']",ppublish,Korean J Physiol Pharmacol. 2020 May 1;24(3):203-212. doi: 10.4196/kjpp.2020.24.3.203.,,['CONFLICTS OF INTEREST The authors declare no conflicts of interest.'],['Copyright (c) Korean J Physiol Pharmacol.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On the basis of the structural features of the most active compounds, a new library of chalcone derivatives, according to the structure-activity relationship design, was synthesized, and their antiproliferative activity was tested against the same cancer cell line. Furthermore, four of these derivatives (compounds 3, 4, 8, 28), based on lower IC50 values (between 6.1 and 8.9 muM), were selected for further investigation regarding the modulation of the protein expression of RACK1 (receptor for activated C kinase), protein kinase C (PKC)alpha and PKCbeta, and their action on the cell cycle level. The cell cycle analysis indicated a block in the G0/G1 phase for all four compounds, with a statistically significant decrease in the percentage of cells in the S phase, with no indication of apoptosis (sub-G0/G1 phase). Compounds 4 and 8 showed a statistically significant reduction in the expression of PKCalpha and an increase in PKCbeta, which together with the demonstration of an antiproliferative role of PKCbeta, as assessed by treating cells with a selective PKCbeta activator, indicated that the observed antiproliferative effect is likely to be mediated through PKCbeta induction.","['Corsini, Emanuela', 'Facchetti, Giorgio', 'Esposito, Sara', 'Maddalon, Ambra', 'Rimoldi, Isabella', 'Christodoulou, Michael S']","['Corsini E', 'Facchetti G', 'Esposito S', 'Maddalon A', 'Rimoldi I', 'Christodoulou MS']","['Laboratory of Toxicology, Dipartimento di Scienze Politiche ed Ambientali, Universita degli Studi di Milano, Milano, Italy.', 'DISFARM, Sezione di Chimica Generale e Organica ""A.

Intensification of chemotherapy and stem cell transplantation are often pivoted on MRD status. Relapse rates are high even with the integration of first-generation FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) inhibitors in pre- and post-transplant regimes and as maintenance in FLT3-mutated AML. Pre-clinical progress is hampered by the lack of suitable modelling of residual disease and post-therapy relapse. In the present study, we investigated the nature of pro-survival signalling in primary residual tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)-treated AML cells adherent to stroma and further determined their drug sensitivity in order to inform rational future therapy combinations. Using a primary human leukaemia-human stroma model to mimic the cell-cell interactions occurring in patients, the ability of several TKIs in clinical use, to abrogate stroma-driven leukaemic signalling was determined, and a synergistic combination with a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK) inhibitor identified for potential therapeutic application in the MRD setting. The findings reveal a common mechanism of stroma-mediated resistance that may be independent of mutational status but can be targeted through rational drug design, to eradicate MRD and reduce treatment-related toxicity.","['Zabkiewicz, Joanna', 'Lazenby, Michelle', 'Edwards, Gareth', 'Bygrave, Ceri A', 'Omidvar, Nader', 'Zhuang, Lihui', 'Knapper, Steve', 'Guy, Carol', 'Hills, Robert K', 'Burnett, Alan K', 'Alvares, Caroline L']","['Zabkiewicz J', 'Lazenby M', 'Edwards G', 'Bygrave CA', 'Omidvar N', 'Zhuang L', 'Knapper S', 'Guy C', 'Hills RK', 'Burnett AK', 'Alvares CL']","['Academic Department of Haematology, University of Cardiff, H, eath Park, Cardiff, UK.', 'Academic Department of Haematology, University of Cardiff, H, eath Park, Cardiff, UK.', 'Academic Department of Haematology, University of Cardiff, H, eath Park, Cardiff, UK.', 'Academic Department of Haematology, University of Cardiff, H, eath Park, Cardiff, UK.', 'Academic Department of Haematology, University of Cardiff, H, eath Park, Cardiff, UK.', 'Academic Department of Haematology, University of Cardiff, H, eath Park, Cardiff, UK.', 'Academic Department of Haematology, University of Cardiff, H, eath Park, Cardiff, UK.', 'Academic Department of Haematology, University of Cardiff, H, eath Park, Cardiff, UK.', 'Academic Department of Haematology, University of Cardiff, H, eath Park, Cardiff, UK.', 'Academic Department of Haematology, University of Cardiff, H, eath Park, Cardiff, UK.', 'Academic Department of Haematology, University of Cardiff, H, eath Park, Cardiff, UK.']",['eng'],"['CAAML/01/2016/Leukaemia Research Appeal for Wales', 'Experimental Cancer Medicine Centre']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200511,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0', '(11-(2-pyrrolidin-1-ylethoxy)-14,19-dioxa-5,7,26-triazatetracyclo(19.3.1.1(2,6).1', '(8,12))heptacosa-1(25),2(26),3,5,8,10,12(27),16,21,23-decaene)', '0 (Bridged-Ring Compounds)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology', 'Bridged-Ring Compounds/pharmacology', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Models, Biological', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', '*fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*acute myeloid leukaemia', '*drug resistance', '*microenvironment', '*minimal residual disease', '*tyrosine kinase inhibitors']",2020/05/13 06:00,2021/03/17 06:00,['2020/05/13 06:00'],"['2020/02/24 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/17 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/13 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/bjh.16665 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2020 Oct;191(2):231-242. doi: 10.1111/bjh.16665.

AKR/J mice, a model described to be susceptible to leukemia development, was used where females were maintained on either standard diet (SD), high sucrose diet, Western diet, or calorie restriction (CR) as they were mated with SD-fed males. Body weights, pregnancy rates, litter size, and litter survival were used as markers of successful pregnancy and pup health. Data indicated that maternal diet had significant effects on litter size, early pup survival, and early pup body weights. As pups matured, the makeup of their respective maternal diet was a predictor of adult metabolic health and survival. Overall, these results suggest that perinatal maternal diet is an important determinant of the health and survival of the offspring and that these effects continue well into adulthood, strongly correlating with lifespan.","['Palliyaguru, Dushani L', 'Rudderow, Annamaria L', 'Sossong, Alex M', 'Lewis, Kaitlyn N', 'Younts, Caitlin', 'Pearson, Kevin J', 'Bernier, Michel', 'de Cabo, Rafael']","['Palliyaguru DL', 'Rudderow AL', 'Sossong AM', 'Lewis KN', 'Younts C', 'Pearson KJ', 'Bernier M', 'de Cabo R']","['Translational Gerontology Branch, National Institute on Aging, NIH, 251 Bayview Blvd, Suite 100, Baltimore, MD, 21224, USA.', 'Translational Gerontology Branch, National Institute on Aging, NIH, 251 Bayview Blvd, Suite 100, Baltimore, MD, 21224, USA.', 'Translational Gerontology Branch, National Institute on Aging, NIH, 251 Bayview Blvd, Suite 100, Baltimore, MD, 21224, USA.', 'Translational Gerontology Branch, National Institute on Aging, NIH, 251 Bayview Blvd, Suite 100, Baltimore, MD, 21224, USA.', 'Translational Gerontology Branch, National Institute on Aging, NIH, 251 Bayview Blvd, Suite 100, Baltimore, MD, 21224, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Nutritional Sciences, University of Kentucky College of Medicine, Lexington, KY, USA.', 'Translational Gerontology Branch, National Institute on Aging, NIH, 251 Bayview Blvd, Suite 100, Baltimore, MD, 21224, USA.', 'Translational Gerontology Branch, National Institute on Aging, NIH, 251 Bayview Blvd, Suite 100, Baltimore, MD, 21224, USA. decaboRa@mail.nih.gov.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",20200511,Switzerland,Geroscience,GeroScience,101686284,,IM,"['Animals', 'Body Weight', '*Diet', 'Female', '*Leukemia', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Pregnancy', 'Reproduction']",PMC7394991,['NOTNLM'],"['*Adiposity', '*Lifespan', '*Maternal gestational diets', '*Perinatal interventions', '*Post-natal environment']",2020/05/13 06:00,2021/04/28 06:00,['2020/05/13 06:00'],"['2020/02/02 00:00 [received]', '2020/04/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/28 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/13 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s11357-020-00199-9 [doi]', '10.1007/s11357-020-00199-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Geroscience. 2020 Aug;42(4):1147-1155. doi: 10.1007/s11357-020-00199-9.

However, the SR frequency in colorectal cancer is very rare. Therefore, the accumulation of SR colorectal cancer cases might contribute to find the regression mechanism. CASE PRESENTATION: A 67-year-old woman received colonoscopy due to being positive for fecal occult blood testing and was diagnosed as having a transverse colon cancer at a local hospital. She was admitted to our institution for surgical treatment of the colon cancer. The colonoscopy revealed a type 2 tumor of 13 mm in diameter at the hepatic flexure of the transverse colon. The enhanced computed tomography (CT) showed an enlarged lymph node in the intermediate lymph node region. The 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/CT showed no abnormal accumulation on the transverse colon; however, an abnormal accumulation was found at the enlarged lymph node. The patient was preoperatively diagnosed as having advanced transverse colon cancer with lymph node metastasis and underwent laparoscopic right hemicolectomy with D3 lymph node dissection. Pathological examination showed only a scar-like tissue and no cancerous lesion in the transverse colon, while a metastatic lymph node was histologically confirmed in the intermediate lymph node region. Loss of MLH1 and PMS2 expression was observed in the cancer cells of both biopsy specimens and resected lymph nodes. No recurrence was seen for 5 years after surgery. CONCLUSIONS: We reported a rare case of SR of the primary transverse colon cancer without regression of the metastatic regional lymph node. We considered that colorectal cancer with SR should be resected because even if SR of the primary lesion occurs, lymph node metastasis might have an inconsistent behavior as shown in the present case.","['Nishiura, Bunpei', 'Kumamoto, Kensuke', 'Akamoto, Shintaro', 'Asano, Eisuke', 'Ando, Yasuhisa', 'Suto, Hironobu', 'Kishino, Takayoshi', 'Oshima, Minoru', 'Fujiwara, Masao', 'Usuki, Hisashi', 'Okano, Keiichi', 'Suzuki, Yasuyuki']","['Nishiura B', 'Kumamoto K', 'Akamoto S', 'Asano E', 'Ando Y', 'Suto H', 'Kishino T', 'Oshima M', 'Fujiwara M', 'Usuki H', 'Okano K', 'Suzuki Y']","['Department of Gastroenterological Surgery, Faculty of Medicine, Kagawa University, 1750-1 Ikenobe, Miki-cho, Kita-gun, Kagawa, 761-0793, Japan.', 'Department of Gastroenterological Surgery, Faculty of Medicine, Kagawa University, 1750-1 Ikenobe, Miki-cho, Kita-gun, Kagawa, 761-0793, Japan. kumamotk@med.kagawa-u.ac.jp.', 'Department of Surgery, Sumitomo Besshi Hospital, Niihama, Japan.', 'Department of Gastroenterological Surgery, Faculty of Medicine, Kagawa University, 1750-1 Ikenobe, Miki-cho, Kita-gun, Kagawa, 761-0793, Japan.', 'Department of Gastroenterological Surgery, Faculty of Medicine, Kagawa University, 1750-1 Ikenobe, Miki-cho, Kita-gun, Kagawa, 761-0793, Japan.', 'Department of Gastroenterological Surgery, Faculty of Medicine, Kagawa University, 1750-1 Ikenobe, Miki-cho, Kita-gun, Kagawa, 761-0793, Japan.', 'Department of Gastroenterological Surgery, Faculty of Medicine, Kagawa University, 1750-1 Ikenobe, Miki-cho, Kita-gun, Kagawa, 761-0793, Japan.', 'Department of Gastroenterological Surgery, Faculty of Medicine, Kagawa University, 1750-1 Ikenobe, Miki-cho, Kita-gun, Kagawa, 761-0793, Japan.', 'Department of Surgery, Takamatsu Red Cross Hospital, Takamatsu, Japan.', 'Department of Gastroenterological Surgery, Faculty of Medicine, Kagawa University, 1750-1 Ikenobe, Miki-cho, Kita-gun, Kagawa, 761-0793, Japan.', 'Department of Gastroenterological Surgery, Faculty of Medicine, Kagawa University, 1750-1 Ikenobe, Miki-cho, Kita-gun, Kagawa, 761-0793, Japan.', 'Department of Gastroenterological Surgery, Faculty of Medicine, Kagawa University, 1750-1 Ikenobe, Miki-cho, Kita-gun, Kagawa, 761-0793, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200511,Germany,Surg Case Rep,Surgical case reports,101662125,,,,PMC7214569,['NOTNLM'],"['Advanced colon cancer', 'Spontaneous regression']",2020/05/13 06:00,2020/05/13 06:01,['2020/05/13 06:00'],"['2020/02/26 00:00 [received]', '2020/04/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/05/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/13 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s40792-020-00858-1 [doi]', '10.1186/s40792-020-00858-1 [pii]']",epublish,Surg Case Rep. 2020 May 11;6(1):100. doi: 10.1186/s40792-020-00858-1.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MLL2/COMPASS methylates H3K4 on many developmental genes and bivalent clusters. To understand MLL2-dependent transcriptional regulation, we performed a CRISPR-based screen with an MLL2-dependent gene as a reporter in mouse embryonic stem cells. We found that MLL2 functions in gene expression by protecting developmental genes from repression via repelling PRC2 and DNA methylation machineries. Accordingly, repression in the absence of MLL2 is relieved by inhibition of PRC2 and DNA methyltransferases. Furthermore, DNA demethylation on such loci leads to reactivation of MLL2-dependent genes not only by removing DNA methylation but also by opening up previously CpG methylated regions for PRC2 recruitment, diluting PRC2 at Polycomb-repressed genes. These findings reveal how the context and function of these three epigenetic modifiers of chromatin can orchestrate transcriptional decisions and demonstrate that prevention of active repression by the context of the enzyme and not H3K4 trimethylation underlies transcriptional regulation on MLL2/COMPASS targets.","['Douillet, Delphine', 'Sze, Christie C', 'Ryan, Caila', 'Piunti, Andrea', 'Shah, Avani P', 'Ugarenko, Michal', 'Marshall, Stacy A', 'Rendleman, Emily J', 'Zha, Didi', 'Helmin, Kathryn A', 'Zhao, Zibo', 'Cao, Kaixiang', 'Morgan, Marc A', 'Singer, Benjamin D', 'Bartom, Elizabeth T', 'Smith, Edwin R', 'Shilatifard, Ali']","['Douillet D', 'Sze CC', 'Ryan C', 'Piunti A', 'Shah AP', 'Ugarenko M', 'Marshall SA', 'Rendleman EJ', 'Zha D', 'Helmin KA', 'Zhao Z', 'Cao K', 'Morgan MA', 'Singer BD', 'Bartom ET', 'Smith ER', 'Shilatifard A']","['Simpson Querrey Center for Epigenetics, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Simpson Querrey Center for Epigenetics, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Simpson Querrey Center for Epigenetics, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Simpson Querrey Center for Epigenetics, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Simpson Querrey Center for Epigenetics, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Simpson Querrey Center for Epigenetics, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Simpson Querrey Center for Epigenetics, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Simpson Querrey Center for Epigenetics, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Simpson Querrey Center for Epigenetics, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Simpson Querrey Center for Epigenetics, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Simpson Querrey Center for Epigenetics, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Simpson Querrey Center for Epigenetics, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Simpson Querrey Center for Epigenetics, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Simpson Querrey Center for Epigenetics, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Simpson Querrey Center for Epigenetics, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Simpson Querrey Center for Epigenetics, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL, USA.

One-hundred-and-eighty-nine NHL patients diagnosed in a 30 years period of 1980-2010 developing an SMN were retrieved from 19 members of the European Intergroup for Childhood NHL and/or the international Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster Study Group. Five subgroups of SMNs were identified: (1) myeloid neoplasms (n = 43; 23%), (2) lymphoid neoplasms (n = 51; 27%), (3) carcinomas (n = 48; 25%), (4) central nervous system (CNS) tumors (n = 19; 10%), and (5) ""other"" SMNs (n = 28; 15%).

Herein, we investigated the effect of nivolumab administered prior to allo-HCT on the following early T-cell reconstitution and its modulation by the GVHD prophylaxis (tacrolimus/sirolimus vs. posttransplant cyclophosphamide [PTCY]). In all nivolumab-exposed patients we detected circulating nivolumab in plasma for up to 56 days after allo-HCT. This residual nivolumab was able to bind and block PD-1 on T-cells at day 21 after allo-HCT, inducing a T cell activation that was differentially modulated depending on the GVHD prophylactic regimen. Among patients receiving tacrolimus/sirolimus, nivolumab-exposed patients had a higher incidence of severe aGVHD and a more effector T-cell profile compared with anti-PD-1-naive patients. Conversely, patients receiving PTCY-based prophylaxis showed a similar risk of aGVHD and T-cell profile irrespective of the previous nivolumab exposure. In conclusion, nivolumab persists in plasma after transplantation, binds to allogeneic T cells and generates an increased T-cell activation. This T-cell activation status can be mitigated with the use of PTCY, thus reducing the risk of aGVHD.","['Nieto, Juan C', 'Roldan, Elisa', 'Jimenez, Isabel', 'Fox, Laura', 'Carabia, Julia', 'Orti,

This study compared outcomes of bone marrow (BM) versus peripheral blood (PB) stem cell graft for haplo-HCT in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). A total of 314 patients with ALL (BM-157; PB-157) were included in this study. The cumulative incidence of engraftment at day 30 was higher in the PB group compared with BM (93% vs. 88%, p < 0.01). The incidences of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and chronic GVHD were not significantly different between the study cohorts. In the multivariate analysis, there were tendencies toward a higher incidence of grade II-IV acute GVHD (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.52, p = 0.07), chronic GVHD (HR = 1.58, p = 0.05), and nonrelapse mortality (NRM) (HR = 1.66, p = 0.06) in patients receiving PB versus BM graft, respectively. The use of PB grafts was associated with lower leukemia-free survival (LFS) (HR = 1.43, p = 0.05), overall survival (OS) (HR = 1.59, p = 0.02), and GVHD-free, relapse-free survival (GRFS) (HR = 1.42, p = 0.03) compared with BM grafts. There was no difference in relapse incidence (HR = 1.23, p = 0.41) between the study groups.

Although there were concerns that the mortality of HAM/TSP could be affected by the development of ATLL, prospective evidence was lacking in this area. In this 5-y prospective cohort study, we determined the mortality, prevalence, and incidence of ATLL in 527 HAM/TSP patients. The standard mortality ratio of HAM/TSP patients was 2.25, and ATLL was one of the major causes of death (5/33 deaths). ATLL prevalence and incidence in these patients were 3.0% and 3.81 per 1,000 person-y, respectively. To identify patients at a high risk of developing ATLL, flow cytometry, Southern blotting, and targeted sequencing data were analyzed in a separate cohort of 218 HAM/TSP patients. In 17% of the HAM/TSP patients, we identified an increase in T cells positive for cell adhesion molecule 1 (CADM1), a marker for ATLL and HTLV-1-infected cells. Genomic analysis revealed that somatic mutations of HTLV-1-infected cells were seen in 90% of these cases and 11% of them had dominant clone and developed ATLL in the longitudinal observation. In this study, we were able to demonstrate the increased mortality in patients with HAM/TSP and a significant effect of ATLL on their prognosis. Having dominant clonal expansion of HTLV-1-infected cells with ATLL-associated somatic mutations may be important characteristics of patients with HAM/TSP who are at an increased risk of developing ATLL.","['Nagasaka, Misako', 'Yamagishi, Makoto', 'Yagishita, Naoko', 'Araya, Natsumi', 'Kobayashi, Seiichiro', 'Makiyama, Junya', 'Kubokawa, Miyuki', 'Yamauchi, Junji', 'Hasegawa, Daisuke', 'Coler-Reilly, Ariella L G', 'Tsutsumi, Shuntaro', 'Uemura, Yu', 'Arai, Ayako', 'Takata, Ayako', 'Inoue, Eisuke', 'Hasegawa, Yasuhiro', 'Watanabe, Toshiki', 'Suzuki, Yutaka', 'Uchimaru, Kaoru', 'Sato, Tomoo', 'Yamano, Yoshihisa']","['Nagasaka M', 'Yamagishi M', 'Yagishita N', 'Araya N', 'Kobayashi S', 'Makiyama J', 'Kubokawa M', 'Yamauchi J', 'Hasegawa D', 'Coler-Reilly ALG', 'Tsutsumi S', 'Uemura Y', 'Arai A', 'Takata A', 'Inoue E', 'Hasegawa Y', 'Watanabe T', 'Suzuki Y', 'Uchimaru K', 'Sato T', 'Yamano Y']","['Division of Neurology, Department of Internal Medicine, St. Marianna University School of Medicine, Kawasaki, Kanagawa 216-8511, Japan.', 'Department of Oncology, Karmanos Cancer Institute, Detroit, MI 48201.', 'Department of Computational Biology and Medical Sciences, Graduate School of Frontier Sciences, The University of Tokyo, Minato-ku, Tokyo 108-8639, Japan.', 'Department of Rare Diseases Research, Institute of Medical Science, St. Marianna University School of Medicine, Kawasaki, Kanagawa 216-8512, Japan.', 'Department of Rare Diseases Research, Institute of Medical Science, St. Marianna University School of Medicine, Kawasaki, Kanagawa 216-8512, Japan.', 'Division of Molecular Therapy, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo 108-8639, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, Research Hospital, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo 108-8639, Japan.', 'Department of Computational Biology and Medical Sciences, Graduate School of Frontier Sciences, The University of Tokyo, Minato-ku, Tokyo 108-8639, Japan.', 'Department of Rare Diseases Research, Institute of Medical Science, St. Marianna University School of Medicine, Kawasaki, Kanagawa 216-8512, Japan.', 'Department of Rare Diseases Research, Institute of Medical Science, St. Marianna University School of Medicine, Kawasaki, Kanagawa 216-8512, Japan.', 'Department of Rare Diseases Research, Institute of Medical Science, St. Marianna University School of Medicine, Kawasaki, Kanagawa 216-8512, Japan.', 'Division of Neurology, Department of Internal Medicine, St. Marianna University School of Medicine, Kawasaki, Kanagawa 216-8511, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, St. Marianna University School of Medicine, Kawasaki, Kanagawa 216-8511, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, St. Marianna University School of Medicine, Kawasaki, Kanagawa 216-8511, Japan.', 'Department of Preventive Medicine, St. Marianna University School of Medicine, Kawasaki, Kanagawa 216-8511, Japan.', 'Department of Medical Informatics, St. Marianna University School of Medicine, Kawasaki, Kanagawa 216-8511, Japan.', 'Division of Neurology, Department of Internal Medicine, St. Marianna University School of Medicine, Kawasaki, Kanagawa 216-8511, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, Research Hospital, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo 108-8639, Japan.', 'Department of Practical Management of Medical Information, St. Marianna University Graduate School of Medicine, Kawasaki, Kanagawa 216-8512, Japan.', 'Department of Computational Biology and Medical Sciences, Graduate School of Frontier Sciences, The University of Tokyo, Chiba 277-8561, Japan.', 'Department of Computational Biology and Medical Sciences, Graduate School of Frontier Sciences, The University of Tokyo, Minato-ku, Tokyo 108-8639, Japan.', 'Department of Rare Diseases Research, Institute of Medical Science, St. Marianna University School of Medicine, Kawasaki, Kanagawa 216-8512, Japan.', 'Division of Neurology, Department of Internal Medicine, St. Marianna University School of Medicine, Kawasaki, Kanagawa 216-8511, Japan;

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: During FDA review of marketing applications for ivosidenib and enasidenib, data from pivotal trials were queried to identify cases of DS in patients with relapsed or refractory (R/R) AML. One hundred seventy-nine patients with R/R AML received ivosidenib and 214 received enasidenib. Adverse events, labs, and vital signs in the first 90 days of treatment were screened per diagnostic criteria, and narratives were reviewed to adjudicate DS cases. RESULTS: We identified 72 of 179 (40%) potential cases for ivosidenib and 86 of 214 (40%) for enasidenib; 34 of 179 (19%) and 41 of 214 (19%) were adjudicated as DS. Leukocytosis was present in 79% and 61% of cases, respectively. Median (range) time to onset was 20 (1-78) and 19 (1-86) days. Grade >/= 3 adverse reactions occurred in 68% and 66%; 6% and 5% were fatal. Univariate analyses suggested baseline bone marrow blasts >/= 48% and peripheral blood blasts >/= 25% and 15% for ivosidenib and enasidenib, respectively, were associated with increased risk of DS. Complete remission (CR) + CR with partial hematologic recovery rates were lower in patients with versus without DS [ivosidenib 18% (95% confidence interval, 7%-35%) vs. 36% (28%-45%); enasidenib 18% (7%-33%) vs. 25% (18%-32%)]. CONCLUSIONS: DS is a common and potentially fatal adverse reaction of IDH inhibitors, and use of standardized diagnostic criteria may aid in earlier diagnosis and treatment.See related commentary by Zeidner, p. 4174.","['Norsworthy, Kelly J', 'Mulkey, Flora', 'Scott, Emma C', 'Ward, Ashley F', 'Przepiorka, Donna', 'Charlab, Rosane', 'Dorff, Sarah E', 'Deisseroth, Albert', 'Kazandjian, Dickran', 'Sridhara, Rajeshwari', 'Beaver, Julia A', 'Farrell, Ann T', 'de Claro, R Angelo', 'Pazdur, Richard']","['Norsworthy KJ', 'Mulkey F', 'Scott EC', 'Ward AF', 'Przepiorka D', 'Charlab R', 'Dorff SE', 'Deisseroth A', 'Kazandjian D', 'Sridhara R', 'Beaver JA', 'Farrell AT', 'de Claro RA', 'Pazdur R']","['Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Silver Spring, Maryland. kelly.norsworthy@fda.hhs.gov.', 'Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Silver Spring, Maryland.', 'Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Silver Spring, Maryland.', 'Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Silver Spring, Maryland.', 'Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Silver Spring, Maryland.', 'Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Silver Spring, Maryland.', 'Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Silver Spring, Maryland.', 'Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Silver Spring, Maryland.', 'Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Silver Spring, Maryland.', 'Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Silver Spring, Maryland.', 'Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Silver Spring, Maryland.', 'Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Silver Spring, Maryland.', 'Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Silver Spring, Maryland.', 'Oncology Center of Excellence, U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Silver Spring, Maryland.']",['eng'],['FD999999/ImFDA/Intramural FDA HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Comment']",20200511,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Aminopyridines)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (Triazines)', '3T1SS4E7AG (enasidenib)', 'EC 1.1.1.41 (Isocitrate Dehydrogenase)', 'Q2PCN8MAM6 (ivosidenib)', 'TE7660XO1C (Glycine)']",IM,"['Aminopyridines', 'Glycine/analogs & derivatives', 'Humans', '*Isocitrate Dehydrogenase/genetics', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/drug therapy/genetics', 'Mutation', 'Pyridines', 'Triazines', 'United States', 'United States Food and Drug Administration']",PMC7442588,,,2020/05/13 06:00,2021/03/13 06:00,['2020/05/13 06:00'],"['2020/03/03 00:00 [received]', '2020/04/28 00:00 [revised]', '2020/05/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/13 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/13 06:00 [entrez]']","['1078-0432.CCR-20-0834 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-20-0834 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2020 Aug 15;26(16):4280-4288. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-20-0834.

This study investigated actual and preferred place of death, concurrence between these and characteristics of preferred place discussions. METHODS: Set within a population-based haematological malignancy patient cohort, adults (>/=18 years) diagnosed 2004-2012 who died 2011-2012 were included (n=963). Data were obtained via routine linkages (date, place and cause of death) and abstraction of hospital records (diagnosis, demographics, preferred place discussions). Logistic regression investigated associations between patient and clinical factors and place of death, and factors associated with the likelihood of having a preferred place discussion. RESULTS: Of 892 patients (92.6%) alive 2 weeks after diagnosis, 58.0% subsequently died in hospital (home, 20.0%; care home, 11.9%; hospice, 10.2%). A preferred place discussion was documented for 453 patients (50.8%). Discussions were more likely in women (p=0.003), those referred to specialist palliative care (p<0.001), and where cause of death was haematological cancer (p<0.001); and less likely in those living in deprived areas (p=0.005). Patients with a discussion were significantly (p<0.05) less likely to die in hospital. Last recorded preferences were: home (40.6%), hospice (18.1%), hospital (17.7%) and care home (14.1%); two-thirds died in their final preferred place. Multiple discussions occurred for 58.3% of the 453, with preferences varying by proximity to death and participants in the discussion. CONCLUSION: Challenges remain in ensuring that patients are supported to have meaningful end-of-life discussions, with healthcare services that are able to respond to changing decisions over time.","['Sheridan, Rebecca', 'Roman, Eve', 'Smith, Alex G', 'Turner, Andrew', 'Garry, Anne C', 'Patmore, Russell', 'Howard, Martin R', 'Howell, Debra A']","['Sheridan R', 'Roman E', 'Smith AG', 'Turner A', 'Garry AC', 'Patmore R', 'Howard MR', 'Howell DA']","['Epidemiology & Cancer Statistics Group, Department of Health Sciences, University of York, York, North Yorkshire, UK rebecca.sheridan@york.ac.uk.', 'Epidemiology & Cancer Statistics Group, Department of Health Sciences, University of York, York, North Yorkshire, UK.', 'Epidemiology & Cancer Statistics Group, Department of Health Sciences, University of York, York, North Yorkshire, UK.', 'Faculty of Health and Social Care, Edge Hill University, Ormskirk, Lancashire, UK.', 'Department of Palliative Care, York Hospital, York, YO31 8HE, UK.', 'Queens Centre for Oncology and Haematology, Castle Hill Hospital, Hull, HU16 5JQ, UK.', 'Department of Haematology, York Hospital, York, YO31 8HE, UK.', 'Epidemiology & Cancer Statistics Group, Department of Health Sciences, University of York, York, North Yorkshire, UK.']",['eng'],"['MCCC-RP-11-A12554/MCCC_/Marie Curie/United Kingdom', 'RP-PG-0613-20002/DH_/Department of Health/United Kingdom']",['Journal Article'],20200511,England,BMJ Support Palliat Care,BMJ supportive & palliative care,101565123,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Cohort Studies', '*Death', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*mortality', 'Home Care Services/statistics & numerical data', 'Hospices/statistics & numerical data', 'Hospitals/statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Patient Preference/*statistics & numerical data', 'Terminal Care/methods/psychology/*statistics & numerical data', 'United Kingdom']",PMC7907576,['NOTNLM'],"['cancer', 'end of life care', 'haematological disease', 'leukaemia', 'lymphoma']",2020/05/13 06:00,2021/05/14 06:00,['2020/05/13 06:00'],"['2019/10/29 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/18 00:00 [revised]', '2020/04/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/14 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/13 06:00 [entrez]']","['bmjspcare-2019-002097 [pii]', '10.1136/bmjspcare-2019-002097 [doi]']",ppublish,BMJ Support Palliat Care. 2021 Mar;11(1):7-16. doi: 10.1136/bmjspcare-2019-002097.

METHODS: The efficacy and safety of zanubrutinib, an investigational highly selective BTK inhibitor, was evaluated in this single-arm, phase 2 study of Chinese patients with relapsed/refractory CLL/SLL. The primary endpoint was overall response rate as assessed by an independent review committee. RESULTS: Of the 91 evaluable patients, 77 (84.6%) achieved a response, with three (3.3%), 54 (59.3%), and 20 (22%) patients achieving a complete response, partial response, and partial response with lymphocytosis, respectively, after a median follow-up of 15.1 months. The estimated 12-month event-free rate for duration of response was 92.9%. The most commonly reported grade >/= 3 adverse events (AEs) were neutropenia (44%), thrombocytopenia (15.4%), lung infection/pneumonia (13.2%), upper respiratory tract infection (9.9%), and anemia (8.8%). The 12-month overall survival rate was 96%. Eight (9.0%) patients discontinued zanubrutinib due to AEs, and seven (8.0%) patients required at least one dose reduction. CONCLUSION: Treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory CLL/SLL with zanubrutinib was generally well tolerated and resulted in a high overall response rate, thereby conferring a favorable benefit-risk profile.

Although uncoordinated 51-like kinase 1 (ULK1), which plays a central role in the autophagy pathway, has emerged as a novel therapeutic target for various cancers, its role in FLT3-ITD AML remains elusive. In this study, we evaluated the effects of ULK1 inhibition on leukemia cell death in FLT3-ITD AML. METHOD: We evaluated ULK1 expression and the levels of apoptosis and autophagy following ULK1 inhibition in FLT3-ITD AML cell lines and investigated the mechanism underlying apoptosis induced by ULK1 inhibition. Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 4.0 (GraphPad Software Inc). RESULTS: FLT3-ITD AML cells showed significantly higher ULK1 expression than FLT3-wild-type (WT) AML cells. Two ULK1 inhibitors, MRT 68921 and SBI-0206965, induced apoptosis in FLT3-ITD AML cells, with relatively minimal effects on FLT3-WT AML cells and normal CD34-positive cells. Apoptosis induction by ULK1 inhibition was associated with caspase pathway activation. Interestingly, ULK1 inhibition paradoxically also induced autophagy, showing synergistic interaction with autophagy inhibitors. Hence, autophagy may act as a prosurvival mechanism in FLT3-ITD AML cells. FLT3-ITD protein degradation and inhibition of the ERK, AKT, and STAT5 pathways were also observed in FLT3-ITD AML cells following treatment with ULK1 inhibitors. CONCLUSION: ULK1 is a viable drug target and ULK1 inhibition may represent a promising therapeutic strategy against FLT3-ITD AML.","['Hwang, Doh Yu', 'Eom, Ju-In', 'Jang, Ji Eun', 'Jeung, Hoi-Kyung', 'Chung, Haerim', 'Kim, Jin Seok', 'Cheong, June-Won', 'Min, Yoo Hong']","['Hwang DY', 'Eom JI', 'Jang JE', 'Jeung HK', 'Chung H', 'Kim JS', 'Cheong JW', 'Min YH']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Severance Hospital, Yonsei University College of Medicine, 50-1 Yonsei-ro, Seodaemun-gu, Seoul, 03722, South Korea.', 'Avison Biomedical Research Center, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, 03722, South Korea.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Severance Hospital, Yonsei University College of Medicine, 50-1 Yonsei-ro, Seodaemun-gu, Seoul, 03722, South Korea.', 'Avison Biomedical Research Center, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, 03722, South Korea.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Severance Hospital, Yonsei University College of Medicine, 50-1 Yonsei-ro, Seodaemun-gu, Seoul, 03722, South Korea.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Severance Hospital, Yonsei University College of Medicine, 50-1 Yonsei-ro, Seodaemun-gu, Seoul, 03722, South Korea.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Severance Hospital, Yonsei University College of Medicine, 50-1 Yonsei-ro, Seodaemun-gu, Seoul, 03722, South Korea.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Severance Hospital, Yonsei University College of Medicine, 50-1 Yonsei-ro, Seodaemun-gu, Seoul, 03722, South Korea. minbrmmd@yuhs.ac.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200511,England,J Exp Clin Cancer Res,Journal of experimental & clinical cancer research : CR,8308647,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (SBI-0206965)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Autophagy-Related Protein-1 Homolog)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (ULK1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Autophagy/drug effects', 'Autophagy-Related Protein-1 Homolog/*antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Benzamides/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', '*Mutation', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'Transfection', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*genetics/metabolism']",PMC7212592,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Apoptosis', 'Autophagy', 'FLT3-ITD mutation', 'ULK1']",2020/05/13 06:00,2021/02/03 06:00,['2020/05/13 06:00'],"['2020/01/08 00:00 [received]', '2020/04/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/05/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/03 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13046-020-01580-4 [doi]', '10.1186/s13046-020-01580-4 [pii]']",epublish,J Exp Clin Cancer Res. 2020 May 11;39(1):85. doi: 10.1186/s13046-020-01580-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the role of PML-RARalpha in leukemogenesis remain largely unknown. RESULTS: Using an inducible system, we comprehensively analyze the 3D genome organization in myeloid cells and its reorganization after PML-RARalpha induction and perform additional analyses in patient-derived APL cells with native PML-RARalpha. We discover that PML-RARalpha mediates extensive chromatin interactions genome-wide. Globally, it redefines the chromatin topology of the myeloid genome toward a more condensed configuration in APL cells; locally, it intrudes RNAPII-associated interaction domains, interrupts myeloid-specific transcription factors binding at enhancers and super-enhancers, and leads to transcriptional repression of genes critical for myeloid differentiation and maturation. CONCLUSIONS: Our results not only provide novel topological insights for the roles of PML-RARalpha in transforming myeloid cells into leukemia cells, but further uncover a topological framework of a molecular mechanism for oncogenic fusion proteins in cancers.","['Wang, Ping', 'Tang, Zhonghui', 'Lee, Byoungkoo', 'Zhu, Jacqueline Jufen', 'Cai, Liuyang', 'Szalaj, Przemyslaw', 'Tian, Simon Zhongyuan', 'Zheng, Meizhen', 'Plewczynski, Dariusz', 'Ruan, Xiaoan', 'Liu, Edison T', 'Wei, Chia-Lin', 'Ruan, Yijun']","['Wang P', 'Tang Z', 'Lee B', 'Zhu JJ', 'Cai L', 'Szalaj P', 'Tian SZ', 'Zheng M', 'Plewczynski D', 'Ruan X', 'Liu ET', 'Wei CL', 'Ruan Y']","['The Jackson Laboratory for Genomic Medicine, 10 Discovery Drive, Farmington, CT, 06030, USA.', 'The Jackson Laboratory for Genomic Medicine, 10 Discovery Drive, Farmington, CT, 06030, USA.', 'Present Address: Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.', 'The Jackson Laboratory for Genomic Medicine, 10 Discovery Drive, Farmington, CT, 06030, USA.', 'The Jackson Laboratory for Genomic Medicine, 10 Discovery Drive, Farmington, CT, 06030, USA.', 'Department of Genetics and Genome Sciences, University of Connecticut Health Center, 400 Farmington Avenue, Farmington, CT, 06030, USA.', 'The Jackson Laboratory for Genomic Medicine, 10 Discovery Drive, Farmington, CT, 06030, USA.', 'Centre of New Technologies, University of Warsaw, Stefana Banacha 2c, 02-097, Warsaw, Poland.', 'The Jackson Laboratory for Genomic Medicine, 10 Discovery Drive, Farmington, CT, 06030, USA.', 'The Jackson Laboratory for Genomic Medicine, 10 Discovery Drive, Farmington, CT, 06030, USA.', 'Centre of New Technologies, University of Warsaw, Stefana Banacha 2c, 02-097, Warsaw, Poland.', 'The Jackson Laboratory for Genomic Medicine, 10 Discovery Drive, Farmington, CT, 06030, USA.', 'The Jackson Laboratory for Genomic Medicine, 10 Discovery Drive, Farmington, CT, 06030, USA.', 'The Jackson Laboratory for Genomic Medicine, 10 Discovery Drive, Farmington, CT, 06030, USA.', 'The Jackson Laboratory for Genomic Medicine, 10 Discovery Drive, Farmington, CT, 06030, USA. yijun.ruan@jax.org.', 'Department of Genetics and Genome Sciences, University of Connecticut Health Center, 400 Farmington Avenue, Farmington, CT, 06030, USA. yijun.ruan@jax.org.']",['eng'],"['P30 CA034196/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30CA034196/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U54 (DK107967, 4DN)/NH/NIH HHS/United States', 'UM1-HG009409-ENCODE/NH/NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200511,England,Genome Biol,Genome biology,100960660,"['0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', '*Chromatin Assembly and Disassembly', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/etiology/*metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*metabolism']",PMC7212609,['NOTNLM'],"['*3D genome architecture', '*CTCF', '*ChIA-PET', '*PML-RARalpha', '*RNA polymerase II (RNAPII)', '*Super-enhancer (SE)', '*Transcription factor (TF)', '*Transcriptional regulation']",2020/05/13 06:00,2021/04/02 06:00,['2020/05/13 06:00'],"['2020/02/26 00:00 [received]', '2020/04/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/05/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/02 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13059-020-02030-2 [doi]', '10.1186/s13059-020-02030-2 [pii]']",epublish,Genome Biol. 2020 May 11;21(1):110. doi: 10.1186/s13059-020-02030-2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The PML protein is a tumor suppressor that plays an important role by interacting with various proteins. Herein, we investigated the effect of the PML isoforms on oncostatin M (OSM)-induced signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT-3) transcriptional activity. PML influenced OSM-induced STAT-3 activity in a cell type-specific manner, which was dependent on the p53 status of the cells but regardless of PML isoform. Interestingly, overexpression of PML exerted opposite effects on OSM-induced STAT-3 activity in p53 wild-type and mutant cells. Specifically, overexpression of PML in the cell lines bearing wild-type p53 (NIH3T3 and U87-MG cells) decreased OSM-induced STAT-3 transcriptional activity, whereas overexpression of PML increased OSM-induced STAT-3 transcriptional activity in mutant p53-bearing cell lines (HEK293T and U251-MG cells). When wild-type p53 cells were co-transfected with PML-IV and R273H-p53 mutant, OSM-mediated STAT-3 transcriptional activity was significantly enhanced, compared to that of cells which were transfected with PML-IV alone; however, when cells bearing mutant p53 were co-transfected with PML-IV and wild-type p53, OSM-induced STAT-3 transcriptional activity was significantly decreased, compared to that of transfected cells with PML-IV alone. In conclusion, PML acts together with wild-type or mutant p53 and influences OSM-mediated STAT-3 activity in a negative or positive manner, resulting in the aberrant activation of STAT-3 in cancer cells bearing mutant p53 probably might occur through the interaction of mutant p53 with PML.","['Lim, Jiwoo', 'Choi, Ji Ha', 'Park, Eun-Mi', 'Choi, Youn-Hee']","['Lim J', 'Choi JH', 'Park EM', 'Choi YH']","['Departments of Physiology, Ewha Womans University College of Medicine, Seoul 07804, Korea.', 'Departments of Pharmacology, Ewha Womans University College of Medicine, Seoul 07804, Korea.', 'Departments of Pharmacology, Ewha Womans University College of Medicine, Seoul 07804, Korea.', 'Departments of Physiology, Ewha Womans University College of Medicine, Seoul 07804, Korea.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Korea (South),Korean J Physiol Pharmacol,The Korean journal of physiology & pharmacology : official journal of the Korean Physiological Society and the Korean Society of Pharmacology,9709505,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Promyelocytic leukemia', 'Signal transducer and activator of transcription-3', 'Transcriptional activity', 'p53']",2020/05/13 06:00,2020/05/13 06:01,['2020/05/13 06:00'],"['2019/08/07 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/22 00:00 [revised]', '2020/02/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/05/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/13 06:01 [medline]']","['kjpp.2020.24.3.203 [pii]', '10.4196/kjpp.2020.24.3.203 [doi]']",ppublish,Korean J Physiol Pharmacol. 2020 May 1;24(3):203-212. doi: 10.4196/kjpp.2020.24.3.203.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Changes in cell metabolism are features of many cancers, including AML and this may be exploited as a therapeutic target. In this study we investigated the in vitro antileukemic effects of seven metabolic inhibitors that target different metabolic pathways. The metabolic inhibitors were tested on AML cells derived from 81 patients using proliferation and viability assays; we also compared global gene expression and proteomic profiles for various patient subsets. Metformin, 2DG, 6AN, BPTES and ST1326 had strong antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects for most patients, whereas lonidamine and AZD3965 had an effect only for a minority. Antiproliferative effects on AML cells were additive when combined with the chemotherapeutic agent AraC. Using unsupervised hierarchical clustering, we identified a strong antiproliferative effect on AML cells after treatment with metabolic inhibitors for a subset of 29 patients. Gene expression and proteomic studies suggested that this subset was characterized by altered metabolic and transcriptional regulation. In addition, the Bcl-2 inhibitor venetoclax, in combination with 2DG or 6AN, increased the antiproliferative effects of these metabolic inhibitors on AML cells. Therapeutic targeting of cellular metabolism may have potential in AML, but the optimal strategy will likely differ between patients.","['Gronningsaeter, Ida Sofie', 'Reikvam, Hakon', 'Aasebo, Elise', 'Bartaula-Brevik, Sushma', 'Tvedt, Tor Henrik', 'Bruserud, Oystein', 'Hatfield, Kimberley Joanne']","['Gronningsaeter IS', 'Reikvam H', 'Aasebo E', 'Bartaula-Brevik S', 'Tvedt TH', 'Bruserud O', 'Hatfield KJ']","['Department of Clinical Science, University of Bergen, 5021 Bergen, Norway.', 'Department of Medicine, Haukeland University Hospital, 5021 Bergen, Norway.', 'Department of Clinical Science, University of Bergen, 5021 Bergen, Norway.', 'Department of Medicine, Haukeland University Hospital, 5021 Bergen, Norway.', 'Department of Clinical Science, University of Bergen, 5021 Bergen, Norway.', 'Department of Clinical Science, University of Bergen, 5021 Bergen, Norway.', 'Department of Clinical Science, University of Bergen, 5021 Bergen, Norway.', 'Department of Medicine, Haukeland University Hospital, 5021 Bergen, Norway.', 'Department of Clinical Science, University of Bergen, 5021 Bergen, Norway.', 'Department of Medicine, Haukeland University Hospital, 5021 Bergen, Norway.', 'Department of Clinical Science, University of Bergen, 5021 Bergen, Norway.', 'Department of Immunology and Transfusion Medicine, Haukeland University Hospital, 5021 Bergen, Norway.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200507,Switzerland,Cells,Cells,101600052,"['0 (Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', '9G2MP84A8W (Deoxyglucose)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'N54AIC43PW (venetoclax)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology', 'Deoxyglucose/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', '*Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Humans', 'Karyotype', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Proteomics', 'Sulfonamides/pharmacology', 'Survival Analysis', 'Young Adult', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics']",PMC7290417,['NOTNLM'],"['*glycolysis', '*leukemia', '*metabolism', '*oxidative phosphorylation']",2020/05/13 06:00,2021/02/26 06:00,['2020/05/13 06:00'],"['2020/03/27 00:00 [received]', '2020/04/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/05/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/26 06:00 [medline]']","['cells9051155 [pii]', '10.3390/cells9051155 [doi]']",epublish,Cells. 2020 May 7;9(5). pii: cells9051155. doi: 10.3390/cells9051155.,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-6939-8059', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3310-8176']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The biology of each leukemia and its corresponding treatment with conventional intensive chemotherapy, with or without targeted therapies (venetoclax, FLT3 inhibitors, IDH1/2 inhibitors, Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitors), introduce additional layers of complexity during COVID-19 high-risk periods. The knowledge about COVID-19 is accumulating rapidly. An important distinction is the prevalence of ""exposure"" versus ""clinical infectivity,"" which determine the risk versus benefit of modifying potentially highly curative therapies in leukemia. At present, the rate of clinical infection is <1-2% worldwide. With a mortality rate of 1-5% in CO-VID-19 patients in the general population and potentially of >30% in patients with cancer, careful consideration should be given to the risk of COVID-19 in leukemia. Instead of reducing patient access to specialized cancer centers and modifying therapies to ones with unproven curative benefit, there is more rationale for less intensive, yet effective therapies that may require fewer clinic visits or hospitalizations. Here, we offer recommendations on the optimization of leukemia management during high-risk COVID-19 periods.","['Paul, Shilpa', 'Rausch, Caitlin R', 'Jain, Nitin', 'Kadia, Tapan', 'Ravandi, Farhad', 'DiNardo, Courtney D', 'Welch, Mary Alma', 'Dabaja, Bouthaina S', 'Daver, Naval', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Wierda, William', 'Pemmaraju, Naveen', 'Montalban Bravo, Guillermo', 'Thompson, Philip', 'Verstovsek, Srdan', 'Konopleva, Marina', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Jabbour, Elias']","['Paul S', 'Rausch CR', 'Jain N', 'Kadia T', 'Ravandi F', 'DiNardo CD', 'Welch MA', 'Dabaja BS', 'Daver N', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Wierda W', 'Pemmaraju N', 'Montalban Bravo G', 'Thompson P', 'Verstovsek S', 'Konopleva M', 'Kantarjian H', 'Jabbour E']","['Division of Pharmacy, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Division of Pharmacy, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA, ejabbour@mdanderson.org.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200511,Switzerland,Acta Haematol,Acta haematologica,0141053,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'COVID-19/*complications/epidemiology/prevention & control', 'Chronic Disease', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*complications/*therapy', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/complications/therapy', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/complications/therapy', 'Pandemics', 'Risk Factors', '*SARS-CoV-2']",PMC7270066,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute leukemia', '*COVID-19', '*Chronic leukemia', '*Myelodysplastic syndrome']",2020/05/12 06:00,2021/04/02 06:00,['2020/05/12 06:00'],"['2020/04/24 00:00 [received]', '2020/04/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/02 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/12 06:00 [entrez]']","['000508199 [pii]', '10.1159/000508199 [doi]']",ppublish,Acta Haematol. 2021;144(2):132-145. doi: 10.1159/000508199.

The recommended dose of midostaurin is 50 mg orally twice daily for AML and 100 mg orally twice daily for ASM, SM-AHN and MCL. Midostaurin was evaluated in two pivotal studies. Study A2301 (RATIFY) included 717 patients with AML. Overall survival (OS) was statistically significantly different between the two groups, and the median OS was 74.7 months in the midostaurin+daunorubicin+cytarabine group and 25.6 months in the placebo+daunorubicin+cytarabine group (HR 0.774; 95% CI 0.629 to 0.953; p=0.0078). Study D2201 included 116 patients with ASM, SM-AHN or MCL. An overall response rate, by IWG-MRT/ECNM (international working group - myelofibrosis research and treatment/European competence network on mastocytosis) criteria of 28.3% was observed in all patients and 60.0%, 20.8% and 33.3% in patients with ASM, SM-AHN and MCL respectively. The most common adverse drug reactions (ADRs) with midostaurin treatment in AML were febrile neutropenia, nausea, exfoliative dermatitis, vomiting, headache, petechiae and fever. In ASM, SM-AHN, MCL the most common ADRs were nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, peripheral oedema and fatigue.

We describe 3 patients as examples of the distinct clinical problems related to HTLV-1: a 53-year-old woman with HTLV-1-associated myelopathy, a 43-year-old woman with acute T-cell lymphoma and a 34-year-old pregnant woman who is an asymptomatic carrier. It is not known how many people are infected in the Netherlands, but it is probably more prevalent among immigrants from the Caribbean and Surinam and likely to be underdiagnosed.

The goal of this research is to (a) describe agreements and differences between measures of working memory and attention (b) identify contributors of these differences, such as emotional distress, affects, and fatigue. METHODS: We used data available for 138 adults successfully treated for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (PETALE cohort). Working memory and attention were assessed using subtests from the WAIS-IV and self-reported questionnaires (BRIEF-SR and CAARS-S:L). Potential contributors included emotional distress, anxiety, depression (BSI-18), affects (PANAS), and fatigue (PedsQL-MFS). We explored measurement agreements and differences using diagnostic indices and multivariate regression models. RESULTS: The frequencies of working memory and attention deficits were higher when using cognitive tests (15%-21%) than with self-reports (10%-11%). Self-reported questionnaires showed high specificity (median 0.87) and low sensitivity (median 0.10), suggesting they did not reliably identify positive cases on cognitive tests. We identified negative affectivity as a possible contributor to inconsistencies between self-report and test results. CONCLUSIONS: When measuring working memory and attention in childhood ALL survivors, cognitive test results and self-reports should not be considered equivalent. At best, self-report may be used for screening (high specificity), but not to assess prevalence in large samples. Self-reported difficulties are also probably influenced by the negative mood in this population.","['Leclerc, Andree-Anne', 'Lippe, Sarah', 'Bertout, Laurence', 'Chapados, Pascale', 'Boulet-Craig, Aubree', 'Drouin, Simon', 'Krajinovic, Maja', 'Laverdiere, Caroline', 'Michon, Bruno', 'Robaey, Philippe', 'Rondeau, Emelie', 'Sinnett, Daniel', 'Sultan, Serge']","['Leclerc AA', 'Lippe S', 'Bertout L', 'Chapados P', 'Boulet-Craig A', 'Drouin S', 'Krajinovic M', 'Laverdiere C', 'Michon B', 'Robaey P', 'Rondeau E', 'Sinnett D', 'Sultan S']","['Research Centre, Sainte-Justine University Health Center (SJUHC), Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Department of Psychology, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Research Centre, Sainte-Justine University Health Center (SJUHC), Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Department of Psychology, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Research Centre, Sainte-Justine University Health Center (SJUHC), Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Research Centre, Sainte-Justine University Health Center (SJUHC), Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Department of Psychology, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Research Centre, Sainte-Justine University Health Center (SJUHC), Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Department of Psychology, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Research Centre, Sainte-Justine University Health Center (SJUHC), Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Research Centre, Sainte-Justine University Health Center (SJUHC), Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Research Centre, Sainte-Justine University Health Center (SJUHC), Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Department of Hematology-Oncology, Quebec University Health Center (QUHC), Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Research Centre, Sainte-Justine University Health Center (SJUHC), Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Department of Psychiatry, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.', 'Research Centre, Sainte-Justine University Health Center (SJUHC), Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Research Centre, Sainte-Justine University Health Center (SJUHC), Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Research Centre, Sainte-Justine University Health Center (SJUHC), Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Department of Psychology, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200601,England,Psychooncology,Psycho-oncology,9214524,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Anxiety/epidemiology/*psychology', 'Attention/*physiology', 'Canada/epidemiology', 'Cancer Survivors/*psychology', 'Child', 'Cognitive Dysfunction/epidemiology/*psychology', 'Cohort Studies', 'Emotions', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Memory, Short-Term/*physiology', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*psychology', 'Prevalence', 'Self Report']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*attention', '*cancer', '*childhood leukemia', '*cognitive test', '*oncology', '*self-report', '*survivors', '*working memory']",2020/05/12 06:00,2020/12/22 06:00,['2020/05/12 06:00'],"['2019/12/07 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/24 00:00 [revised]', '2020/05/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/22 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/12 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pon.5410 [doi]'],ppublish,Psychooncology. 2020 Jul;29(7):1201-1208. doi: 10.1002/pon.5410.

As mutations in both these genes confer resistance to thiopurines, early detection protocols using peripheral blood could be implemented to preemptively alter maintenance therapy to extinguish resistant clones before overt relapse.","['Saliba, Jason', 'Evensen, Nikki A', 'Meyer, Julia A', 'Newman, Daniel', 'Nersting, Jacob', 'Narang, Sonali', 'Ma, Xiaotu', 'Schmiegelow, Kjeld', 'Carroll, William L']","['Saliba J', 'Evensen NA', 'Meyer JA', 'Newman D', 'Nersting J', 'Narang S', 'Ma X', 'Schmiegelow K', 'Carroll WL']","['Department of Pediatrics, Perlmutter Cancer Center, NYU Langone Health, New York.', 'Department of Pathology, Perlmutter Cancer Center, NYU Langone Health, New York.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Perlmutter Cancer Center, NYU Langone Health, New York.', 'Department of Pathology, Perlmutter Cancer Center, NYU Langone Health, New York.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Perlmutter Cancer Center, NYU Langone Health, New York.', 'Department of Pathology, Perlmutter Cancer Center, NYU Langone Health, New York.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, The University Hospital Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Perlmutter Cancer Center, NYU Langone Health, New York.', 'Department of Pathology, Perlmutter Cancer Center, NYU Langone Health, New York.', ""St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, The University Hospital Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Institute of Clinical Medicine, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Perlmutter Cancer Center, NYU Langone Health, New York.', 'Department of Pathology, Perlmutter Cancer Center, NYU Langone Health, New York.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, NYU Langone Health, New York.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA140729-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016087/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20200511,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/*blood/genetics', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Clone Cells/metabolism/*pathology', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', '*Mutation', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/blood/genetics/*pathology/therapy', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/genetics/*pathology/therapy', 'Prognosis']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*backtracking', '*clonal evolution', '*ddPCR', '*relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*thiopurines']",2020/05/12 06:00,2020/08/25 06:00,['2020/05/12 06:00'],"['2020/01/14 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/26 00:00 [revised]', '2020/03/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/25 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/12 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.28306 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2020 Jul;67(7):e28306. doi: 10.1002/pbc.28306.

METHODS: We developed daily billing and ICD-9 code definitions to identify relapses and HSCTs within a cohort of children with newly diagnosed ALL between January 1, 2004, and December 31, 2013, previously assembled from the Pediatric Health Information System (PHIS) database. Chart review for children with ALL at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) and Texas Children's Hospital (TCH) was performed to establish relapse and HSCT gold standards for sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV) calculations. We estimated incidences of relapse and HSCT in the PHIS ALL cohort. RESULTS: We identified 362 CHOP and 314 TCH ALL patients in PHIS and established true positives by chart review. Sensitivity and PPV for identifying both relapse and HSCT in PHIS were > 90% at both hospitals. Five-year relapse incidence in the 10 150-patient PHIS cohort was 10.3% (95% CI 9.8%-10.9%) with 7.1% (6.6%-7.6%) of children underwent HSCTs. Patients in higher-risk demographic groups had higher relapse and HSCT rates. Our analysis also identified differences in incidences of relapse and HSCT by race, ethnicity, and insurance status. CONCLUSIONS: Administrative data can be used to identify relapse and HSCT accurately in children with ALL whether they occur on- or off-therapy, in contrast with published approaches. This method has wide potential applicability for estimating these incidences in pediatric ALL, including patients not enrolled on clinical trials.","['Cahen, Viviane C', 'Li, Yimei', 'Getz, Kelly D', 'Elgarten, Caitlin W', 'DiNofia, Amanda M', 'Wilkes, Jennifer J', 'Winestone, Lena E', 'Huang, Yuan-Shung V', 'Miller, Tamara P', 'Gramatges, M Monica', 'Rabin, Karen R', 'Fisher, Brian T', 'Aplenc, Richard', 'Seif, Alix E']","['Cahen VC', 'Li Y', 'Getz KD', 'Elgarten CW', 'DiNofia AM', 'Wilkes JJ', 'Winestone LE', 'Huang YV', 'Miller TP', 'Gramatges MM', 'Rabin KR', 'Fisher BT', 'Aplenc R', 'Seif AE']","[""Center for Childhood Cancer Research, Division of Oncology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."", ""Center for Childhood Cancer Research, Division of Oncology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."", 'Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology, and Informatics, Perelman School of Medicine of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Perelman School of Medicine of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', ""Center for Childhood Cancer Research, Division of Oncology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."", 'Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology, and Informatics, Perelman School of Medicine of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', ""Center for Pediatric Clinical Effectiveness, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."", ""Center for Childhood Cancer Research, Division of Oncology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."", ""Center for Childhood Cancer Research, Division of Oncology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Perelman School of Medicine of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', ""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Seattle Children's Hospital and the Department of Pediatrics, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington."", ""Division of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital, University of California - San Francisco, San Francisco, California."", ""Center for Pediatric Clinical Effectiveness, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."", ""Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Atlanta, Georgia."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia.', ""Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Texas Children's Hospital and Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas."", ""Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Texas Children's Hospital and Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas."", 'Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology, and Informatics, Perelman School of Medicine of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Perelman School of Medicine of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', ""Division of Infectious Diseases, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."", ""Center for Childhood Cancer Research, Division of Oncology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."", 'Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology, and Informatics, Perelman School of Medicine of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Perelman School of Medicine of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', ""Center for Childhood Cancer Research, Division of Oncology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Perelman School of Medicine of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', ""Center for Pediatric Clinical Effectiveness, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200511,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*administrative data', '*pediatric', '*relapse', '*stem cell transplantation']",2020/05/12 06:00,2020/05/12 06:00,['2020/05/12 06:00'],"['2020/03/19 00:00 [revised]', '2020/01/17 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/12 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/12 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.28315 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2021 Sep;68(9):e28315. doi: 10.1002/pbc.28315.

Most HTLV-1-infected individuals are asymptomatic, and only 3% to 5% of carriers develop ATL. Here, we describe the contribution of aberrant DNA methylation to ATL leukemogenesis. HTLV-1-infected T-cells and their uninfected counterparts were separately isolated based on CADM1 and CD7 expression status, and differentially methylated positions (DMPs) specific to HTLV-infected T cells were identified through genome-wide DNA methylation profiling. Accumulation of DNA methylation at hypermethylated DMPs correlated strongly with ATL development and progression. In addition, we identified 22 genes downregulated because of promoter hypermethylation in HTLV-1-infected T cells, including THEMIS, LAIR1, and RNF130, which negatively regulate T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling. Phosphorylation of ZAP-70, a transducer of TCR signaling, was dysregulated in HTLV-1-infected cell lines but was normalized by reexpression of THEMIS. Therefore, we hypothesized that DNA hypermethylation contributes to growth advantages in HTLV-1-infected cells during ATL leukemogenesis. To test this idea, we investigated the anti-ATL activities of OR-1200 and OR-2100 (OR21), novel decitabine (DAC) prodrugs with enhanced oral bioavailability. Both DAC and OR21 inhibited cell growth, accompanied by global DNA hypomethylation, in xenograft tumors established by implantation of HTLV-1-infected cells. OR21 was less hematotoxic than DAC, whereas tumor growth inhibition was almost identical between the 2 compounds, making it suitable for long-term treatment of ATL patient-derived xenograft mice. Our results demonstrate that regional DNA hypermethylation is functionally important for ATL leukemogenesis and an effective therapeutic target.","['Watanabe, Tatsuro', 'Yamashita, Satoshi', 'Ureshino, Hiroshi', 'Kamachi, Kazuharu', 'Kurahashi, Yuki', 'Fukuda-Kurahashi, Yuki', 'Yoshida, Nao', 'Hattori, Naoko', 'Nakamura, Hideaki', 'Sato, Akemi', 'Kawaguchi, Atsushi', 'Sueoka-Aragane, Naoko', 'Kojima, Kensuke', 'Okada, Seiji', 'Ushijima, Toshikazu', 'Kimura, Shinya', 'Sueoka, Eisaburo']","['Watanabe T', 'Yamashita S', 'Ureshino H', 'Kamachi K', 'Kurahashi Y', 'Fukuda-Kurahashi Y', 'Yoshida N', 'Hattori N', 'Nakamura H', 'Sato A', 'Kawaguchi A', 'Sueoka-Aragane N', 'Kojima K', 'Okada S', 'Ushijima T', 'Kimura S', 'Sueoka E']","['Department of Drug Discovery and Biomedical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, Saga University, Saga, Japan.', 'Division of Epigenomics, National Cancer Center Research Institute, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Drug Discovery and Biomedical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, Saga University, Saga, Japan.', 'Department of Drug Discovery and Biomedical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, Saga University, Saga, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Respiratory Medicine and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Saga University, Saga, Japan.', 'Department of Drug Discovery and Biomedical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, Saga University, Saga, Japan.', 'OHARA Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Shiga, Japan.', 'Department of Drug Discovery and Biomedical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, Saga University, Saga, Japan.', 'OHARA Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Shiga, Japan.', 'Department of Drug Discovery and Biomedical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, Saga University, Saga, Japan.', 'Division of Epigenomics, National Cancer Center Research Institute, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Transfusion Medicine.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, and.', 'Section of Clinical Cooperation System, Center for Comprehensive Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Saga University, Saga, Japan; and.', 'Division of Hematology, Respiratory Medicine and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Saga University, Saga, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Respiratory Medicine and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Saga University, Saga, Japan.', 'Division of Hematopoiesis, Joint Research Center for Human Retrovirus Infection, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan.', 'Division of Epigenomics, National Cancer Center Research Institute, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Drug Discovery and Biomedical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, Saga University, Saga, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Respiratory Medicine and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Saga University, Saga, Japan.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, and.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Drugs, Investigational)', '0 (OR-2100)', '0 (Pyridines)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Cell Transformation, Viral/drug effects/genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA Methylation/*drug effects/genetics', 'Demethylation/drug effects', 'Drugs, Investigational/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'HTLV-I Infections/complications/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/drug effects/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy/methods', 'Pyridines/*administration & dosage', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays', 'Young Adult']",,,,2020/05/12 06:00,2021/03/18 06:00,['2020/05/12 06:00'],"['2019/08/27 00:00 [received]', '2020/04/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/18 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/12 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)61801-8 [pii]', '10.1182/blood.2019003084 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2020 Aug 13;136(7):871-884. doi: 10.1182/blood.2019003084.,,,['(c) 2020 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,['Blood. 2020 Aug 13;136(7):777-779.

However, its potential effect on AML remains largely unknown. Lactate dehydrogenase B (LDHB) is the key glycolytic enzyme that catalyses the interconversion between pyruvate and lactate. Currently, little is known about the role of LDHB in AML. In this study, we found that ATPR showed antileukaemic effects with RARalpha dependent in AML cells. LDHB was aberrantly overexpressed in human AML peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) and AML cell lines. A lentiviral vector expressing LDHB-targeting shRNA was constructed to generate a stable AML cells with low expression of LDHB. The effect of LDHB knockdown on differentiation and cycle arrest of AML cells was assessed in vitro and vivo, including involvement of Raf/MEK/ERK signalling. Finally, these data suggested that ATPR showed antileukaemic effects by RARalpha/LDHB/ ERK-glycolysis signalling axis.

Newly diagnosed de novo AML patients with FLT3-ITD were enrolled at the achievement of CR1 and received allo-HSCT as soon as possible after the first consolidation therapy. Mutations of 57 genes in AML cells at diagnosis were also analyzed. Among 48 eligible patients with a median age of 38.5 (17-49) years, 36 (75%) received allo-HSCT at a median of 108 days after CR1. The median follow-up was 1726 days. The primary end-point, 3-year disease-free survival (DFS) based on an intent to treat analysis, was 43.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 30%-57%), suggesting the efficacy of this treatment because the lower limit of the 95% CI exceeded the threshold response rate of 20%. The 3-year overall survival, post-transplant DFS, and non-relapse mortality rates were 54.2% (95% CI, 39%-67%), 58.3% (95% CI, 41%-72%), and 25.0% (95% CI, 12%-40%), respectively. The median ITD allelic ratio (AR) was 0.344 (0.006-4.099). Neither FLT3-ITD AR nor cooccurring genetic alterations was associated with a poor DFS. This prospective study indicated the efficacy and safety of allo-HSCT for FLT3-ITD AML patients in CR1.

Research on chemotherapy resistance has mainly focused on the heterogeneity of cancer cells, multiple gene mutations, and quiescence of malignant cancer cells. However, some studies have indicated that interactions between cancer cells and vascular cells promote resistance to chemotherapy. Here, we established mouse leukemia models using the cell lines THP-1 or MEG-1. These were derived from acute and chronic myeloid leukemias, respectively, and highly expressed DNA replication factor PSF1, a member of the GINS complex. We found that, after anti-cancer drug administration, surviving GFP-positive leukemia cells in the bone marrow were located adjacent to blood vessels, as previously reported in a subcutaneous solid tumor transplantation model. Treating THP-1 and MEG-1 cells with anti-cancer drugs in vitro revealed that those most strongly expressing PSF1 were most chemoresistant, suggesting that PSF1 induces not only cell cycle progression but also facilitates cell survival. Indeed, when PSF1 expression was suppressed by shRNA, the growth rate was reduced and cell death was enhanced in both cell lines. Furthermore, PSF1 knockdown in leukemia cells led to a change in their location at a distance from the blood vessels in a bone marrow transplantation model. These findings potentially reflect a mechanism of escape of leukemic cells from chemotherapy and suggest that PSF1 may be a possible therapeutic target to enhance the effect of chemotherapy.","['Hsieh, Han-Yun', 'Jia, Weizhen', 'Jin, Ze-Cheng', 'Kidoya, Hiroyasu', 'Takakura, Nobuyuki']","['Hsieh HY', 'Jia W', 'Jin ZC', 'Kidoya H', 'Takakura N']","['Department of Signal Transduction, Research Institute for Microbial Disease, Osaka University, Suita, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Signal Transduction, Research Institute for Microbial Disease, Osaka University, Suita, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Signal Transduction, Research Institute for Microbial Disease, Osaka University, Suita, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Signal Transduction, Research Institute for Microbial Disease, Osaka University, Suita, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Signal Transduction, Research Institute for Microbial Disease, Osaka University, Suita, Osaka, Japan.']",['eng'],"['19cm0106508h0004/Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development', '19gm5010002h0003/Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development', '16H02470/Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development', '2018/Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development', 'Japan Society for the Promotion of Science']",['Journal Article'],20200601,England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 2)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (TAP1 protein, human)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 2/*genetics/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/*genetics', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', '*Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",PMC7385346,['NOTNLM'],"['PSF1', 'blood vessel', 'cell cycle', 'cell death', 'leukemia']",2020/05/12 06:00,2020/08/11 06:00,['2020/05/12 06:00'],"['2019/08/23 00:00 [received]', '2020/04/08 00:00 [revised]', '2020/04/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/11 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/12 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/cas.14452 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2020 Jul;111(7):2400-2412. doi: 10.1111/cas.14452.

CNS tumors can be associated with significant morbidity, even those classified as low grade. Mortality from CNS tumors is disproportionately high compared to other childhood malignancies, although surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy have improved outcomes in these patients over the last few decades. Current therapeutic strategies lead to a high risk of side effects, especially in young children. Pediatric brain tumor survivors have unique sequelae compared to age-matched patients who survived other malignancies. They are at greater risk of significant impairment in cognitive, neurological, endocrine, social, and emotional domains, depending on the location and type of the CNS tumor. Next-generation genomics have shed light on the broad molecular heterogeneity of pediatric brain tumors and have identified important genes and signaling pathways that serve to drive tumor proliferation. This insight has impacted the research field by providing potential therapeutic targets for these diseases. In this review, we highlight recent progress in understanding the molecular basis of common pediatric brain tumors, specifically low-grade glioma, high-grade glioma, ependymoma, embryonal tumors, and atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor (ATRT).

Contrary to B-cell ALL, reports on T-ALL MRD are limited and mostly based on molecular methods, mainly from developed countries. Multicolor flow cytometry (MFC)-based T-ALL studies are very few. Clinically relevant cut-off levels and ideal time-point for MRD assessment are still inconclusive. In view of lack of T-ALL MRD data from the developing world, we evaluated the prognostic value of MFC-based post-induction (PI)-MRD assessment in T-ALL in the context of standard practice. Methods: We included 256 childhood-T-ALL patients (age < 15 years) treated with a modified-MCP841 protocol, which uses high-dose cytarabine during consolidation, as a part of standard hospital practice. MRD was studied using 10-color 11-antibody MFC with any level of detectable disease being considered positive. Post-induction (PI)-MRD was available in all patients, and post-consolidation (PC) MRD was available mostly in PI-MRD-positive patients (n = 88). Results: Three years cumulative-incidence-of-relapse (3years-CIR) in PI-MRD-positive patients was inferior to negative patients (46.3% vs. 18.4%). The median relapse-free-survival (RFS), event-free-survival (EFS) and overall-survival (OS) with hazard ratio (HR) of PI-MRD-positive patients were 21.4 months vs not reached (p < 0.0001, HR-4.7), 21.6 months vs. not-reached (p = 0.0003, HR-2.01) and 37.3 months vs. not reached (p = 0.026, HR-1.64) respectively. RFS, EFS and OS of patients with PI-MRD<0.01% (n = 17) were as inferior as PI-MRD >/= 0.01% in comparison with MRD-negative patients with HR of 4.7 (p < 0.0001), 2.45 (p = 0.0003), and 2.5 (p = 0.029), respectively. Three-years-CIR of patients with hyperleukocytosis (>/=100 x 109/L) was also higher (50.5 vs. 27.6%) with inferior RFS, EFS, and OS. Among PI-MRD-positive patients, 3years-CIR, RFS, EFS, and OS of PC-MRD-positive were also inferior to that of negative patients. On multivariate analysis any-level detectable PI-MRD and hyperleukocytosis remained independently associated with inferior RFS, EFS, and OS. A combination of PI-MRD-positive status and hyperleukocytosis identified the patients with the worst clinical outcomes. Conclusion: Detectable PI-MRD using MFC was found to be the strong predictive factor of inferior clinical outcome in T-ALL patients.

Since treatment options are few and efficacy is low, new approaches such as de novo allo-HSCT, targeted therapies and biomodulatory drugs have been developed, albeit prognosis is very poor. In this manuscript we present an unusual case of a patient with high-risk AML with an unbalanced jumping translocation and FLT3-TKD (low) mutation who presented with early relapse (FLT3 negative) after allo-HSCT, refractory to one cycle of azacytidine and discontinuation of immunosuppression (IS). As salvage therapy, the patient received a biomodulatory therapy consisting of low-dose azacytidine 75 mg/day (given s.c. d1-7 of 28), pioglitazone 45 mg/day orally, and all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) 45 mg/m(2)/day orally achieving a complete remission after two cycles of therapy. Even after cessation of treatment after 5 cycles, the patient remained in complete remission with full chimerism in peripheral blood and bone marrow for another 7 months. In conclusion, we report about an unusual case of long-lasting complete remission of early relapsed high-risk AML after allo-HSCT treated with azacytidine, pioglitazone and ATRA after standard of care treatment with HMA and discontinuation of IS failed.","['Kattner, Anna-Sophia', 'Holler, Ernst', 'Herr, Wolfgang', 'Reichle, Albrecht', 'Wolff, Daniel', 'Heudobler, Daniel']","['Kattner AS', 'Holler E', 'Herr W', 'Reichle A', 'Wolff D', 'Heudobler D']","['Department of Internal Medicine III, Hematology and Internal Oncology, University Hospital Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, Hematology and Internal Oncology, University Hospital Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, Hematology and Internal Oncology, University Hospital Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, Hematology and Internal Oncology, University Hospital Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, Hematology and Internal Oncology, University Hospital Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, Hematology and Internal Oncology, University Hospital Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.']",['eng'],,['Case Reports'],20200423,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,,PMC7190808,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'allogeneic stem cell transplantation', 'anakoinosis', 'biomodulatory treatment', 'relapse']",2020/05/12 06:00,2020/05/12 06:01,['2020/05/12 06:00'],"['2019/11/30 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/05/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/12 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2020.00443 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2020 Apr 23;10:443. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2020.00443. eCollection 2020.,,,"['Copyright (c) 2020 Kattner, Holler, Herr, Reichle, Wolff and Heudobler.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Based on our previous studies showing bendamustine with total body irradiation (BEN-TBI) conditioning reduces GvHD compared to the current clinical standard of care cyclophosphamide (CY)-TBI in a murine MHC-mismatched bone marrow transplantation (BMT) model, this study aimed to evaluate the role and fate of donor T-cells following BEN-TBI conditioning. We demonstrate that BEN-TBI reduces GvHD compared to CY-TBI independently of T regulatory cells (Tregs). BEN-TBI conditioned mice have a smaller proportion and less activated donor T-cells, with lower CD47 expression, early post-transplant, but no sustained phenotypic differences in T-cells. In BEN-TBI conditioned mice, donor T-cells gain tolerance specific to host MHC antigens. Though these T-cells are tolerant to host antigens, we demonstrate that BEN-TBI preserves a T-cell-dependent GvL effect. These findings indicate that BEN-TBI conditioning reduces GvHD without compromising GvL, warranting its further investigation as a potentially safer and more efficacious clinical alternative to CY-TBI.","['Stokes, Jessica', 'Hoffman, Emely A', 'Molina, Megan S', 'Kummet, Nicole', 'Simpson, Richard J', 'Zeng, Yi', 'Katsanis, Emmanuel']","['Stokes J', 'Hoffman EA', 'Molina MS', 'Kummet N', 'Simpson RJ', 'Zeng Y', 'Katsanis E']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA.', 'Department of Immunobiology, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA.', 'Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA.', 'Department of Immunobiology, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA.', 'Department of Nutritional Sciences, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA.', 'The University of Arizona Cancer Center, Tucson, AZ, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA.', 'The University of Arizona Cancer Center, Tucson, AZ, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA.', 'Department of Immunobiology, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA.', 'The University of Arizona Cancer Center, Tucson, AZ, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200430,United States,Oncoimmunology,Oncoimmunology,101570526,['981Y8SX18M (Bendamustine Hydrochloride)'],,"['Animals', '*Bendamustine Hydrochloride/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease', '*Graft vs Leukemia Effect', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', '*T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/immunology/radiation effects', '*Transplantation Conditioning', '*Whole-Body Irradiation']",PMC7199810,['NOTNLM'],"['*BMT', '*GvHD', '*GvL', '*bendamustine', '*conditioning']",2020/05/12 06:00,2020/05/12 06:01,['2020/05/12 06:00'],"['2020/02/24 00:00 [received]', '2020/04/01 00:00 [revised]', '2020/04/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/05/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/12 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1080/2162402X.2020.1758011 [doi]', '1758011 [pii]']",epublish,Oncoimmunology. 2020 Apr 30;9(1):1758011. doi: 10.1080/2162402X.2020.1758011. eCollection 2020.,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-7064-6881', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1466-6965']",,"['(c) 2020 The Author(s).

When thoracic extramedullary hemopoiesis presents as posterior mediastinum masses in specific clinical contexts, the diagnosis is not challenging. Other radiological presentations may be more difficult for diagnosis and require biopsy. Needle biopsy is typically preferred for the diagnosis of extramedullary hemopoiesis however, the high vascularization of tissues is one of the complications of this method thus, it is avoided. The aim of the present study was to compare the diagnostic parameters of CT with MRI for the diagnosis of thoracic extramedullary hemopoiesis in patients with leukemia, with an open lung biopsy as a reference standard. Chest CT, chest MRI and open lung biopsy data from a total of 912 patients with leukemia with a sign(s) and symptoms of suspected paravertebral and/or pulmonary extramedullary hemopoiesis were reviewed. In the present study, thoracic extramedullary hemopoiesis was defined as diffusivity of both lung fields being increased compared with the blood pool and no other abnormal focal of lungs being increased compared with the blood pool. The beneficial score was calculated for CT and MRI and plotted for the decision making of irradiation. With respect to open lung biopsy, MRI had a higher sensitivity compared with CT (0.865 vs. 0.809; P<0.0001; q=1691) however, CT had a higher accuracy compared with MRI (0.833 vs. 0.733; P<0.0001; q=3020). The low rate of overdiagnosis was observed for both methods for the detection of thoracic extramedullary hemopoiesis however, the working area for detecting thoracic extramedullary hemopoiesis at least once in images was higher for MRI compared with CT. CT and MRI both have diagnostic importance in the detection of thoracic extramedullary hemopoiesis in patients with leukemia however, chest MRI misdiagnoses the condition while CT can confirm it (level of evidence, 3).","['Ling, Zhiyu', 'Xia, Yingyi', 'Wang, Qiuxia']","['Ling Z', 'Xia Y', 'Wang Q']","[""Department of Radiology, The First People's Hospital of Yongkang, Yongkang, Zhejiang 321300, P.R.

Therefore, CSCs play crucial role in the initiation and the maintenance of cancer. Moreover, it has been proposed throughout several studies that CSCs are behind the failure of the conventional chemo-/radiotherapy as well as cancer recurrence due to their ability to resist the therapy and their ability to re-regenerate. Thus, the need for targeted therapy to eliminate CSCs is crucial; for that reason, chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells has currently been in use with high rate of success in leukemia and, to some degree, in patients with solid tumors. This review outlines the most common CSC populations and their common markers, in particular CD133, CD90, EpCAM, CD44, ALDH, and EGFR(VIII), the interaction between CSCs and the immune system, CAR T cell genetic engineering and signaling, CAR T cells in targeting CSCs, and the barriers in using CAR T cells as immunotherapy to treat solid cancers.","['Alhabbab, Rowa Y']",['Alhabbab RY'],"['Division of Applied Medical Sciences, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200422,Switzerland,Front Genet,Frontiers in genetics,101560621,,,,PMC7188929,['NOTNLM'],"['cancer stem cell', 'chimeric antigen receptor T cell', 'chimeric antigen receptor T cell production', 'chimeric antigen receptor T cell signaling', 'chimeric antigen receptor generations']",2020/05/12 06:00,2020/05/12 06:01,['2020/05/12 06:00'],"['2019/12/04 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/05/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/12 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fgene.2020.00312 [doi]'],epublish,Front Genet. 2020 Apr 22;11:312. doi: 10.3389/fgene.2020.00312. eCollection 2020.,,,['Copyright (c) 2020 Alhabbab.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With an annual incidence of ~30,770 cases in the United States, MM has a high mortality rate, leading to 12,770 deaths per year. MM is a genetically complex, highly heterogeneous malignancy, with significant inter- and intra-patient clonal variability. Recent years have witnessed dramatic improvements in the diagnostics, classification, and treatment of MM. However, patients with high-risk disease have not yet benefited from therapeutic advances. High-risk patients are often primary refractory to treatment or relapse early, ultimately resulting in progression toward aggressive end-stage MM, with associated extramedullary disease or plasma cell leukemia. Therefore, novel treatment modalities are needed to improve the outcomes of these patients. Bispecific antibodies (BsAbs) are immunotherapeutics that simultaneously target and thereby redirect effector immune cells to tumor cells. BsAbs have shown high efficacy in B cell malignancies, including refractory/relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Various BsAbs targeting MM-specific antigens such as B cell maturation antigen (BCMA), CD38, and CD138 are currently in pre-clinical and clinical development, with promising results. In this review, we outline these advances, focusing on BsAb drugs, their targets, and their potential to improve survival, especially for high-risk MM patients. In combination with current treatment strategies, BsAbs may pave the way toward a cure for MM.","['Caraccio, Chiara', 'Krishna, Sachi', 'Phillips, Darci J', 'Schurch, Christian M']","['Caraccio C', 'Krishna S', 'Phillips DJ', 'Schurch CM']","['Baxter Laboratory for Stem Cell Biology, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, United States.', 'Baxter Laboratory for Stem Cell Biology, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, United States.', 'Baxter Laboratory for Stem Cell Biology, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, United States.', 'Baxter Laboratory for Stem Cell Biology, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, United States.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20200424,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,"['0 (Antibodies, Bispecific)', '0 (B-Cell Maturation Antigen)', '0 (Epitopes)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/immunology', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Bispecific/*therapeutic use', 'B-Cell Maturation Antigen/immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/*physiology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Epitopes', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Plasma Cell/immunology/*therapy', 'Multiple Myeloma/immunology/*therapy', 'Risk']",PMC7193016,['NOTNLM'],"['*BCMA', '*CD38', '*bispecific antibodies', '*clinical trials', '*high-risk disease', '*multiple myeloma', '*review']",2020/05/12 06:00,2021/03/30 06:00,['2020/05/12 06:00'],"['2019/11/30 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/05/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2020.00501 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2020 Apr 24;11:501. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2020.00501. eCollection 2020.,,,"['Copyright (c) 2020 Caraccio, Krishna, Phillips and Schurch.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To test for K(+) channel function during DNA damage response, we subjected human chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cells to sub-lethal doses of ionizing radiation (0-8 Gy, 6 MV photons) and determined K(+) channel activity, K(+) channel-dependent Ca(2+) signaling, cell cycle progression, DNA repair, and clonogenic survival by whole-cell patch clamp recording, fura-2 Ca(2+) imaging, Western blotting, flow cytometry, immunofluorescence microscopy, and pre-plating colony formation assay, respectively. As a result, the human erythroid CML cell line K562 and primary human CML cells functionally expressed hERG1. Irradiation stimulated in both cell types an increase in the activity of hERG1 K(+) channels which became apparent 1-2 h post-irradiation. This increase in K(+) channel activity was paralleled by an accumulation in S phase of cell cycle followed by a G2/M cell cycle arrest as analyzed between 8 and 72 h post-irradiation. Attenuating the K(+) channel function by applying the hERG1 channel inhibitor E4031 modulated Ca(2+) signaling, impaired inhibition of the mitosis promoting subunit cdc2, overrode cell cycle arrest, and decreased clonogenic survival of the irradiated cells but did not affect repair of DNA double strand breaks suggesting a critical role of the hERG1 K(+) channels for the Ca(2+) signaling and the cell cycle control during DNA damage response.","['Palme, Daniela', 'Misovic, Milan', 'Ganser, Katrin', 'Klumpp, Lukas', 'Salih, Helmut R', 'Zips, Daniel', 'Huber, Stephan M']","['Palme D', 'Misovic M', 'Ganser K', 'Klumpp L', 'Salih HR', 'Zips D', 'Huber SM']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, University Hospital Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, University Hospital Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, University Hospital Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, University Hospital Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Clinical Collaboration Unit Translational Immunology, German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), University Hospital Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, University Hospital Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Partner Site Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.', 'German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, University Hospital Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200424,Switzerland,Front Pharmacol,Frontiers in pharmacology,101548923,,,,PMC7194033,['NOTNLM'],"['G2/M arrest', 'S progression', 'flow cytometry', 'hERG1 potassium channels', 'ionizing radiation', 'patch-clamp whole-cell recording']",2020/05/12 06:00,2020/05/12 06:01,['2020/05/12 06:00'],"['2019/12/09 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/05/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/12 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fphar.2020.00489 [doi]'],epublish,Front Pharmacol. 2020 Apr 24;11:489. doi: 10.3389/fphar.2020.00489. eCollection 2020.,,,"['Copyright (c) 2020 Palme, Misovic, Ganser, Klumpp, Salih, Zips and Huber.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: DEGs were analyzed by R package ""DESeq2"" and then run GSEA, GO enrichment, KEGG pathway and PPI network. Hub genes were selected out according to MCC. Log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test was used for survival analysis. Mann-Whitney U's nonparametric t test and Fisher's exact test was used for continuous and categorical variables respectively. p value< 0.05 was considered to be statistical significance. Results: TNFRSF4 was final screened out as a key gene. Besides TP53 mutation (p = 0.0118), high TNFRSF4 was also associated with FLT3 mutation (p = 0.0102) and NPM1 mutation (p = 0.0024). Elevated TNFRSF4 was significantly related with intermediate (p = 0.0004) and poor (p = 0.0011) risk stratification as well as relapse statute (p = 0.0099). Patients with elevated TNFRSF4 expression had significantly shorter overall survival (median survival: 2.35 months vs. 21 months, p < 0.0001). Based on our clinical center data, TNFRSF4 expression was significantly higher in non-M3 AML patients than HDs (p = 0.0377) and MDS patients (EB-1, 2; p = 0.0017). Conclusions: Elevated TNFRSF4 expression was associated with TP53, FLT3 and NPM1 mutation as well as poor clinical outcome. TNFRSF4 expression was significantly higher in non-M3 AML patients than HDs and MDS (EB-1, 2) patients. TNFRSF4 is need for future functional and mechanistic studies to investigate the role in non-M3 AML.","['Gu, Siyu', 'Zi, Jie', 'Han, Qi', 'Song, Chunhua', 'Ge, Zheng']","['Gu S', 'Zi J', 'Han Q', 'Song C', 'Ge Z']","['1Department of Hematology, Zhongda Hospital, School of Medicine, Southeast University, Institute of Hematology Southeast University, No. 87, Dingjiaqiao, Gulou District, Nanjing, 210009 Jiangsu China.grid.263826.b0000 0004 1761 0489', '1Department of Hematology, Zhongda Hospital, School of Medicine, Southeast University, Institute of Hematology Southeast University, No. 87, Dingjiaqiao, Gulou District, Nanjing, 210009 Jiangsu China.grid.263826.b0000 0004 1761 0489', '1Department of Hematology, Zhongda Hospital, School of Medicine, Southeast University, Institute of Hematology Southeast University, No. 87, Dingjiaqiao, Gulou District, Nanjing, 210009 Jiangsu China.grid.263826.b0000 0004 1761 0489', '2Hershey Medical Center, Pennsylvania State University Medical College, Hershey, PA17033 USA.grid.29857.310000 0001 2097 4281', '1Department of Hematology, Zhongda Hospital, School of Medicine, Southeast University, Institute of Hematology Southeast University, No. 87, Dingjiaqiao, Gulou District, Nanjing, 210009 Jiangsu China.grid.263826.b0000 0004 1761 0489']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200504,England,Cancer Cell Int,Cancer cell international,101139795,,,,PMC7197135,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'Bioinformatics', 'TCGA', 'TNFRSF4']",2020/05/12 06:00,2020/05/12 06:01,['2020/05/12 06:00'],"['2020/02/25 00:00 [received]', '2020/04/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/05/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/12 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12935-020-01213-y [doi]', '1213 [pii]']",epublish,Cancer Cell Int. 2020 May 4;20:146. doi: 10.1186/s12935-020-01213-y. eCollection 2020.,['ORCID: 0000-0001-8028-1612'],['Competing interestsThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.'],['(c) The Author(s) 2020.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The current work used common assays including cell cycle, apoptosis, clone formation and western blot to perform cytological detection for HL60 (wild type), NB4 (carrying t[15;17] chromosome translocation) and Kasumi-1 (with c-KIT N822K mutation); and meanwhile, the laser tweezers Raman spectroscopy (LTRS) was also used to perform label-free detection of single living cells. The results demonstrated that Kasumi-1 cell line bearing c-KIT N822K mutation has a stable cell cycle, while there was a significant difference between early and late apoptosis within 48 hours. The LTRS detection initially reflected the spectral differences induced by genetic abnormalities and highlighted progressive patterns of DNA and amino acids band contents which were appropriately consistent with that of cell clone ratio and the c-KIT phosphorylation level. It is concluded that methodology of LTRS-based single living cell characterization could be potential and effective to reveal gene mutation-induced cell differentiation.","['Chen, Yang', 'Wang, Lingyan', 'Lin, Xindi', 'Zhang, Qian', 'Xu, Yunchao', 'Lin, Donghong', 'Xu, Jianping', 'Feng, Shangyuan', 'Hu, Jianda']","['Chen Y', 'Wang L', 'Lin X', 'Zhang Q', 'Xu Y', 'Lin D', 'Xu J', 'Feng S', 'Hu J']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Fujian Institute of Hematology, Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory on Hematology, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, Fuzhou, China.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, China.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Optoelectronic Science and Technology for Medicine, Ministry of Education, Fujian Normal University, Fuzhou, China.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, China.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Optoelectronic Science and Technology for Medicine, Ministry of Education, Fujian Normal University, Fuzhou, China.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Fujian Institute of Hematology, Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory on Hematology, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, Fuzhou, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200605,Germany,J Biophotonics,Journal of biophotonics,101318567,"['0 (Core Binding Factors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (KIT protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)']",IM,"['Core Binding Factors/genetics', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics', 'Mutation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*CBF-AML', '*c-KIT N822K mutation', '*chromosome translocation', '*flow cytometry', '*laser tweezers Raman spectroscopy']",2020/05/12 06:00,2021/06/24 06:00,['2020/05/12 06:00'],"['2020/03/20 00:00 [received]', '2020/04/24 00:00 [revised]', '2020/05/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/24 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/12 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jbio.202000103 [doi]'],ppublish,J Biophotonics. 2020 Aug;13(8):e202000103. doi: 10.1002/jbio.202000103.

Unfortunately, many of these patients relapse after HCT and have a limited survival. The recent approval of venetoclax, an orally bioavailable BCL-2 inhibitor, resulted in significant responses in treatment naive acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and off-label use in the relapsed/refractory setting is increasing. We report the outcomes of 21 patients who underwent allogeneic HCT for myeloid disease, relapsed with AML, and were treated with venetoclax. Several patients had poor risk features including antecedent hematologic malignancy (6/21), complex karyotype (6/21), and TP53 mutations (5/21). The median age was 64.5 years and time from HCT to relapse was 5.7 months (range: 0.9 to 44.9 months). Of the 19 patients who were assessed for response, there were meaningful treatment responses seen in eight patients: five CR, three CRi, zero PR, for an ORR of 42.1%. Treatment effect was seen in six additional patients, including four in the morphologic leukemia-free state. Nine patients maintained their response for >/=3 months and eight were receiving therapy at data cut. Post-HCT AML relapse has an exceedingly poor outcome, and venetoclax-based therapy is a potent therapy option that should be studied prospectively in this setting.","['Byrne, Michael', 'Danielson, Nathalie', 'Sengsayadeth, Salyka', 'Rasche, Adrianne', 'Culos, Katie', 'Gatwood, Katie', 'Wyatt, Houston', 'Chinratanalab, Wichai', 'Dholaria, Bhagirathbhai', 'Ferrell, P Brent', 'Fogo, Kristin', 'Goodman, Stacey', 'Jagasia, Madan', 'Jayani, Reena', 'Kassim, Adetola', 'Mohan, Sanjay R', 'Savani, Bipin N', 'Strickland, Stephen A', 'Engelhardt, Brian G', 'Savona, Michael']","['Byrne M', 'Danielson N', 'Sengsayadeth S', 'Rasche A', 'Culos K', 'Gatwood K', 'Wyatt H', 'Chinratanalab W', 'Dholaria B', 'Ferrell PB', 'Fogo K', 'Goodman S', 'Jagasia M', 'Jayani R', 'Kassim A', 'Mohan SR', 'Savani BN', 'Strickland SA', 'Engelhardt BG', 'Savona M']","['Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.', 'Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.', 'Tennessee Valley Healthcare System, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.', 'Tennessee Valley Healthcare System, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.', 'Department of Nursing, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.', 'Tennessee Valley Healthcare System, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.', 'Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.', 'Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.', 'Department of Nursing, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.', 'Tennessee Valley Healthcare System, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.', 'Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.', 'Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.', 'Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.', 'Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.', 'Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.', 'Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.', 'Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.', 'Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.', 'Program in Cancer Biology, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20200615,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', 'N54AIC43PW (venetoclax)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Allografts', 'Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic/*administration & dosage', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/mortality/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Salvage Therapy', 'Sulfonamides/*administration & dosage', 'Survival Rate']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myeloid leukemia', '*allogeneic transplantation', '*relapse']",2020/05/12 06:00,2020/12/30 06:00,['2020/05/12 06:00'],"['2020/03/07 00:00 [received]', '2020/04/26 00:00 [revised]', '2020/05/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/30 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/12 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.25859 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2020 Sep;95(9):1006-1014. doi: 10.1002/ajh.25859.

InO has received attention as a bridging therapy before transplantation due to its high complete remission (CR) rate. However, the significance of InO in non-transplant patients remains unclear. We retrospectively evaluated four non-transplant patients treated with InO. All cases achieved CR after receiving at least two cycles of InO. Three of the four cases survived for more than 11 months without relapse. Moreover, all patients received InO as outpatients, because the adverse events were well-controlled.

One of its members, MLL1, has additionally received a lot of attention as it is a potent oncogenic driver in different types of leukaemia when aberrantly fused to a large variety of partners as a result of chromosomal translocations. Its exclusive association with cancers of the haematopoietic system has prompted a large number of investigations into the role of MLL/SET proteins in haematopoiesis, a summary of which was attempted in this review. Interestingly, MLL-rearranged leukaemias are particularly prominent in infant and paediatric leukaemia, which commonly initiate in utero. This, together with the known function of MLL/SET proteins in embryonic development, has focussed research efforts in recent years on understanding the role of this protein family in developmental haematopoiesis and how this may be subverted by MLL oncofusions in infant leukaemia. A detailed understanding of these prenatal events is essential for the development of new treatments that improve the survival specifically of this very young patient group.","['Antunes, Eric T B', 'Ottersbach, Katrin']","['Antunes ETB', 'Ottersbach K']","['MRC Centre for Regenerative Medicine, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, Scotland, UK.', 'MRC Centre for Regenerative Medicine, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, Scotland, UK.

However, its clinical relevance as an allergen is not fully appreciated. This is likely due to collagen insolubility in neutral aqueous solutions, leading to low abundance in commercially available in vitro and skin prick tests for fish allergy. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relevance of fish collagen as an allergen in a large patient population (n = 101). METHODS: Acid-soluble collagen type I was extracted from muscle and skin of Atlantic salmon, barramundi, and yellowfin tuna. IgE binding to collagen was analyzed by ELISA for 101 fish-allergic patients. Collagen-sensitized patients' sera were tested for IgE binding to parvalbumin from the same fish species. IgE cross-linking was analyzed by rat basophil leukemia assay and basophil activation test. Protein identities were confirmed by mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Purified fish collagen contained type I alpha1 and alpha2 chains and their multimers. Twenty-one of 101 patients (21%) were sensitized to collagen. Eight collagen-sensitized patients demonstrated absence of parvalbumin-specific IgE to some fish species. Collagen induced functional IgE cross-linking, as shown by rat basophil leukemia assay performed using 6 patients' sera, and basophil activation test using fresh blood from 1 patient. Collagen type I alpha chains from barramundi and Atlantic salmon were registered at www.allergen.org as Lat c 6 and Sal s 6, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: IgE sensitization and IgE cross-linking capacity of fish collagen were demonstrated in fish-allergic patients. Inclusion of relevant collagen allergens in routine diagnosis is indicated to improve the capacity to accurately diagnose fish allergy.","['Kalic, Tanja', 'Kamath, Sandip D', 'Ruethers, Thimo', 'Taki, Aya C', 'Nugraha, Roni', 'Le, Thu T K', 'Humeniuk, Piotr', 'Williamson, Nicholas A', 'Hira, Diamond', 'Rolland, Jennifer M', ""O'Hehir, Robyn E"", 'Dai, Danyi', 'Campbell, Dianne E', 'Breiteneder, Heimo', 'Lopata, Andreas L']","['Kalic T', 'Kamath SD', 'Ruethers T', 'Taki AC', 'Nugraha R', 'Le TTK', 'Humeniuk P', 'Williamson NA', 'Hira D', 'Rolland JM', ""O'Hehir RE"", 'Dai D', 'Campbell DE', 'Breiteneder H', 'Lopata AL']","['Institute of Pathophysiology and Allergy Research, Center for Pathophysiology, Infectiology and Immunology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', ""College of Public Health, Medical and Veterinary Sciences, Australian Institute of Tropical Health and Medicine, Molecular Allergy Research Laboratory, James Cook University, Townsville, QLD, Australia; Centre for Food and Allergy Research, Murdoch Children's Research Institute, Melbourne, VIC, Australia."", ""College of Public Health, Medical and Veterinary Sciences, Australian Institute of Tropical Health and Medicine, Molecular Allergy Research Laboratory, James Cook University, Townsville, QLD, Australia; Centre for Food and Allergy Research, Murdoch Children's Research Institute, Melbourne, VIC, Australia."", ""College of Public Health, Medical and Veterinary Sciences, Australian Institute of Tropical Health and Medicine, Molecular Allergy Research Laboratory, James Cook University, Townsville, QLD, Australia; Centre for Food and Allergy Research, Murdoch Children's Research Institute, Melbourne, VIC, Australia; Veterinary Biosciences, Melbourne Veterinary School, Faculty of Veterinary and Agricultural Sciences, The University of Melbourne, Melbourne, VIC, Australia."", 'College of Public Health, Medical and Veterinary Sciences, Australian Institute of Tropical Health and Medicine, Molecular Allergy Research Laboratory, James Cook University, Townsville, QLD, Australia; Department of Aquatic Product Technology, Bogor Agricultural University, Bogor, Jawa Barat, Indonesia.', 'College of Public Health, Medical and Veterinary Sciences, Australian Institute of Tropical Health and Medicine, Molecular Allergy Research Laboratory, James Cook University, Townsville, QLD, Australia.', 'Institute of Pathophysiology and Allergy Research, Center for Pathophysiology, Infectiology and Immunology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Bio21 Mass Spectrometry and Proteomics Facility, The Bio21 Molecular Science and Biotechnology Institute, The University of Melbourne, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Allergy Centre, Townsville, QLD, Australia.', 'Department of Immunology and Pathology, Monash University, Melbourne, VIC, Australia; Department of Allergy, Immunology and Respiratory Medicine, Central Clinical School, Monash University and The Alfred Hospital, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Department of Immunology and Pathology, Monash University, Melbourne, VIC, Australia; Department of Allergy, Immunology and Respiratory Medicine, Central Clinical School, Monash University and The Alfred Hospital, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', ""Department of Allergy and Immunology, Children's Hospital at Westmead, Sydney, NSW, Australia."", ""Centre for Food and Allergy Research, Murdoch Children's Research Institute, Melbourne, VIC, Australia; Department of Allergy and Immunology, Children's Hospital at Westmead, Sydney, NSW, Australia."", 'Institute of Pathophysiology and Allergy Research, Center for Pathophysiology, Infectiology and Immunology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', ""College of Public Health, Medical and Veterinary Sciences, Australian Institute of Tropical Health and Medicine, Molecular Allergy Research Laboratory, James Cook University, Townsville, QLD, Australia; Centre for Food and Allergy Research, Murdoch Children's Research Institute, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.

While asparaginase in whatever available formulation is a key component of modern treatment of ALL, many adult oncologists and hematologists struggle to deal with its particular toxicities in clinical practice. We reviewed toxicity outcomes of pegylated asparaginase (PEG-ASP) in adults with ALL treated in 3 reference centers in Brazil. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a cross-sectional retrospective chart-review study encompassing patients aged 15 years and older diagnosed with ALL or ambiguous-lineage leukemia who received at least one dose of PEG-ASP, regardless of the adopted regimen. RESULTS: A total of 57 patients were included (age range, 15-57 years). Most patients (70%) received 2000 IU/m(2) as the initial dose, by intravenous route (72%). The incidence of thromboembolic events was 17.5%, and the main site was cerebral venous sinus (4/10). Thrombosis was more frequent in patients receiving second-line treatment. In obese patients, grade 3 hepatotoxicity and hyperbilirubinemia were more common. Clinical pancreatitis (grade 3 or higher) was found in 2 of 57 cases. PEG-ASP had to be discontinued in 19.3% of exposed patients (11/57). CONCLUSION: By reviewing the medical charts of adult patients with ALL from 3 reference centers, we found that our incidence of thrombotic and hepatic adverse events is similar to those reported in other trials involving PEG-ASP. Usually these effects should not preclude further use of the drug because most events are manageable in routine clinical practice.","['Silva, Wellington F da', 'Massaut, Ires H B', 'Bendlin, Rodrigo M', 'Rosa, Lidiane I', 'Velloso, Elvira D R P', 'Rego, Eduardo M', 'Rocha, Vanderson']","['Silva WFD', 'Massaut IHB', 'Bendlin RM', 'Rosa LI', 'Velloso EDRP', 'Rego EM', 'Rocha V']","['Instituto do Cancer do Estado de Sao Paulo (ICESP), Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Sao Paulo (FMUSP), Sao Paulo, Brazil.

The present study compared the prognostic value of 5 PIs: CLL international prognostic index (CLL-IPI), Barcelona-Brno, international prognostic score-A (IPS-A), CLL-01, and a tailored approach. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We applied the 5 PIs to a cohort of 428 unselected patients with Binet A CLL from a multicenter Spanish database with clinical and biologic information available. The predictive value of the scores was assessed using Harrell's concordance index (C index) and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). RESULTS: We found a significant association between time to first treatment and risk subgroups for all 5 PIs used. The most accurate PI was the IPS-A (C-index, 0.72; AUC, 0.76), closely followed by CLL-01 (C-index, 0.69; AUC, 0.70), CLL-IPI (C-index, 0.69; AUC, 0.69), Barcelona-Brno (C-index, 0.67; AUC, 0.69), and the tailored approach (C-index, 0.61 and 0.58; AUC, 0.58 and 0.54). CONCLUSIONS: The concordance between the PIs was low (44%), suggesting that although all these PIs improve clinical staging and help physicians in routine clinical practice, it will be necessary to harmonize larger cohorts of patients to define the best PI for treatment decision-making in the real world.","['Gonzalez-Gascon-Y-Marin, Isabel', 'Munoz-Novas, Carolina', 'Figueroa, Inigo', 'Hernandez-Sanchez, Maria', 'Rodriguez-Vicente, Ana-Eugenia', 'Quijada-Alamo, Miguel', 'Perez-Carretero, Claudia', 'Moreno, Carol', 'Collado, Rosa', 'Espinet, Blanca', 'Puiggros, Anna', 'Heras, Natalia de Las', 'Bosch, Francesc', 'Hernandez, Jose-Angel']","['Gonzalez-Gascon-Y-Marin I', 'Munoz-Novas C', 'Figueroa I', 'Hernandez-Sanchez M', 'Rodriguez-Vicente AE', 'Quijada-Alamo M', 'Perez-Carretero C', 'Moreno C', 'Collado R', 'Espinet B', 'Puiggros A', 'Heras NL', 'Bosch F', 'Hernandez JA']","['Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital Universitario Infanta Leonor, Madrid, Spain.

In the present study, we evaluated the significance of the sIL-2R index among patients who underwent cord blood transplantation (CBT). METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 31 patients who underwent single-unit CBT as their first transplantation for hematologic malignancies. RESULTS: The median sIL-2R index was 4.2. The cumulative incidence of grade II to IV acute GVHD was not associated with the sIL-2R index. However, the cumulative incidence of relapse at 3 years after transplantation was significantly lower, with an sIL-2R index >/= 3.7 than with an index < 3.7 (12.8% vs 50.0%; P = .04). As a result, the probability of overall survival at 3 years after transplantation was significantly higher in the former group than in the latter (79.8% vs 20.0%; P < .01). Only the dose of corticosteroid administered in the pre-engraftment period influenced the sIL-2 index. CONCLUSION: The sIL-2R index can predict the incidence of relapse and probability of survival after CBT, possibly reflecting a graft-vs-leukemia effect.","['Kajimura, Yasuko', 'Nakamura, Yukinori', 'Tanaka, Yoshinori', 'Tanaka, Mayumi', 'Yamamoto, Kaoru', 'Matsuguma, Masafumi', 'Tokunaga, Yoshihiro', 'Yujiri, Toshiaki', 'Tanizawa, Yukio']","['Kajimura Y', 'Nakamura Y', 'Tanaka Y', 'Tanaka M', 'Yamamoto K', 'Matsuguma M', 'Tokunaga Y', 'Yujiri T', 'Tanizawa Y']","['Third Department of Internal Medicine, Yamaguchi University School of Medicine, Ube, Yamaguchi, Japan.', 'Third Department of Internal Medicine, Yamaguchi University School of Medicine, Ube, Yamaguchi, Japan.

The relationship between virus or provirus and specific antibodies in these secretions is particular to each infected cow and will probably determine whether the consumption of colostrum or milk from these naturally infected dams provides an infective or a protective effect in recipient calves. Our recent findings suggest that this issue is a key point in BLV transmission in very young calves. Based on this, the aim of the present study was to determine the effect of the spray-drying treatment of colostrum on BLV infectivity. The treatment was done on scale-down conditions, using fresh colostrum from BLV-negative cows spiked with infective BLV. Residual infectivity was tested in susceptible lambs. Lambs inoculated with colostrum spiked with BLV-infected cells or cell-free BLV showed evidence of infection 60 d after inoculation, whereas none of the lambs inoculated with spray-dried colostrum showed evidence of infection 60 d after inoculation. These results provide direct evidence that the experimental spray-drying process used in this study was effective in inactivating infectious BLV in colostrum. These findings suggest that the risk for BLV transmission could be reduced if milk and colostrum were treated by spray-drying prior to consumption in dairy facilities. The effect of spray-drying on the functional properties and stability of the antibodies present in colostrum under long-term storage should be further investigated.","['Lomonaco, Marina', 'Sowul, Mariana', 'Gutierrez, Geronimo', 'Malacari, Dario', 'Alvarez, Irene', 'Porta, Natalia Gabriela', 'Zabal, Osvaldo', 'Trono, Karina']","['Lomonaco M', 'Sowul M', 'Gutierrez G', 'Malacari D', 'Alvarez I', 'Porta NG', 'Zabal O', 'Trono K']","['Instituto de Virologia, Centro de Investigaciones en Ciencias Veterinarias y Agronomicas, Instituto Nacional de Tecnologia Agropecuaria (INTA), Nicolas Repetto y de los Reseros s/n (B1686 LQF), Hurlingham, Buenos Aires, Argentina.

This new electrode is intended for use in cell recognition via electron-transfer and cross-linker peptide immobilization. Myelopeptide-4 (MP-4:FRPRIMTP) is a marrow-origin peptide that interacts with receptors of the human leukemia cell line (K562 cells), and allows their differentiation. The YYYYC electron-transfer peptide improves the electron-transfer accessibility from an electroactive compound to an electrode. Oligoalanine plays the role of a cross-linker that immobilizes a peptide series (Ac-FRPRIMTPYYYYCAAAAA) to collagen, which then allows it to be cast onto an electrode. Use of the electrode with a peptide increased the peak currents of [Fe(CN)6](4-/3-) and also improved the reversibility of redox. These improvements are due to the interaction between [Fe(CN)6](4-/3-) and the peptide. When electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were carried out using a collagen/peptide probe-immobilized electrode, the electron transfer resisitance was lower than that without the peptide. The detection of K562 cells was based on an increase in resistance, because MP-4 was bound to the receptors on the cell surface. The responses were linear and ranged in number from 27 to 2,000 cells/mLwith a detection limit of 8 cells/mL. Recoveries of 50 and 1,000 cells/mL in human serum were accomplished at rates of 98 and 101%, respectively. Consequently, the proposed procedure is a powerful new concept for cytosensing.","['Sugawara, Kazuharu', 'Ishizaki, Sora', 'Kodaira, Keito', 'Kuramitz, Hideki', 'Kadoya, Toshihiko']","['Sugawara K', 'Ishizaki S', 'Kodaira K', 'Kuramitz H', 'Kadoya T']","['Maebashi Institute of Technology, Gunma, 371-0816, Japan.

32389183,NLM,MEDLINE,20200826,20210702,2468-1253 (Electronic),5,7,2020 Jul,"Short-course, direct-acting antivirals and ezetimibe to prevent HCV infection in recipients of organs from HCV-infected donors: a phase 3, single-centre, open-label study.",649-657,S2468-1253(20)30081-9 [pii] 10.1016/S2468-1253(20)30081-9 [doi],"BACKGROUND: An increasing percentage of potential organ donors are infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV). After transplantation from an infected donor, establishment of HCV infection in uninfected recipients is near-universal, with the requirement for post-transplant antiviral treatment. The aim of this study was to determine if antiviral drugs combined with an HCV entry blocker given before and for 7 days after transplant would be safe and reduce the likelihood of HCV infection in recipients of organs from HCV-infected donors. METHODS: HCV-uninfected organ recipients without pre-existing liver disease were treated with ezetimibe (10 mg; an HCV entry inhibitor) and glecaprevir-pibrentasvir (300 mg/120 mg) before and after transplantation from HCV-infected donors aged younger than 70 years without co-infection with HIV, hepatitis B virus, or human T-cell leukaemia virus 1 or 2. Recipients received a single dose 6-12 h before transplant and once a day for 7 days after surgery (eight doses in total). HCV RNA was assessed once a day for 14 days and then once a week until 12 weeks post-transplant. The primary endpoint was prevention of chronic HCV infection, as evidenced by undetectable serum HCV RNA at 12 weeks after transplant, and assessed in the intention-to-treat population. Safety monitoring was according to routine post-transplant practice. 12-week data are reported for the first 30 patients. The trial is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04017338. The trial is closed to recruitment but follow-up is ongoing. FINDINGS: 30 patients (23 men and seven women; median age 61 years (IQR 48-66) received transplants (13 lung, ten kidney, six heart, and one kidney-pancreas) from 18 HCV-infected donors. The median donor viral load was 5.11 log10IU/mL (IQR 4.55-5.63) and at least three HCV genotypes were represented (nine [50%] donors with genotype 1, two [11%] with genotype 2, five [28%] with genotype 3, and two [11%] with unknown genotype). All 30 (100%) transplant recipients met the primary endpoint of undetectable HCV RNA at 12 weeks post-transplant, and were HCV RNA-negative at last follow-up (median 36 weeks post-transplant [IQR 25-47]). Low-level viraemia was transiently detectable in 21 (67%) of 30 recipients in the early post-transplant period but not after day 14. Treatment was well tolerated with no dose reductions or treatment discontinuations; 32 serious adverse events occurred in 20 (67%) recipients, with one grade 3 elevation in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) possibly related to treatment. Non-serious transient elevations in ALT and creatine kinase during the study dosing period resolved with treatment completion. Among the serious adverse events were two recipient deaths due to causes unrelated to study drug treatment (sepsis at 49 days and subarachnoid haemorrhage at 109 days post-transplant), with neither patient ever being viraemic for HCV. INTERPRETATION: Ezetimibe combined with glecaprevir-pibrentasvir given one dose before and for 7 days after transplant prevented the establishment of chronic HCV infection in recipients of different organs from HCV-infected donors. This study shows that an ultra-short course of direct-acting antivirals and ezetimibe can prevent the establishment of chronic HCV infection in the recipient, alleviating many of the concerns with transplanting organs from HCV-infected donors.

Synthetic PIF (sPIF) has both immune-protective and regenerative properties, and reduces oxidative stress and protein misfolding. PIF is detected by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in hyperplastic endometriotic lesions and advanced uterine cancer. sPIF reduces graft-versus-host disease while maintaining a graft-versus-leukemia effect. METHODS: PIF detection in prostate cancer was assessed in 50 human prostate samples following radical prostatectomy using tumor-microarray-based IHC correlating PIF immune staining with Gleason score (GS) and cancer aggressiveness. RESULTS: PIF was detected in moderate-to-high risk prostate cancer (GS 4+3 and beyond, prognostic groups 3 to 5). In prostate cancer (GS (WHO Grade Group (GG)5), PIF was detected in 50% of cases; in prostate cancer (GS 4+4 GG4), PIF was observed in 62.5% of cases; in prostate cancer (GS 4+3 GG3), PIF immunostaining was observed in 57.1% of cases. In prostate cancer, (GS 3+4 GG2) and (GS 3+3 GG1) cases where PIF staining was negative to weak, membranous staining was observed in 20% of cases (staining pattern considered negative). High-grade prostate intraepithelial neoplasia PIF positive stain in 28.57% of cases (6 of 21) was observed. In contrast, PIF was not detected in normal prostate glands. Importantly, sPIF added to the PC3 cell line alone or combined with prostate cancer fibroblast feeder-cells did not affect proliferation. Only when peripheral blood mononuclear cells were added to the culture, a minor increase in cell proliferation was noted, reflecting local proliferation control. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, PIF assessment could be a valuable, simple-to-use immunohistochemical biomarker to evaluate aggressiveness/prognosis in specimens from prostate cancer patients.","['Raspollini, Maria Rosaria', 'Montagnani, Ilaria', 'Cirri, Paolo', 'Baroni, Gianna', 'Cimadamore, Alessia', 'Scarpelli, Marina', 'Cheng, Liang', 'Lopez-Beltran, Antonio', 'Montironi, Rodolfo', 'Barnea, Eytan R']","['Raspollini MR', 'Montagnani I', 'Cirri P', 'Baroni G', 'Cimadamore A', 'Scarpelli M', 'Cheng L', 'Lopez-Beltran A', 'Montironi R', 'Barnea ER']","['Histopathology and Molecular Diagnostics, University Hospital Careggi, Florence, Toscana, Italy.', 'Histopathology and Molecular Diagnostics, University Hospital Careggi, Florence, Toscana, Italy.', 'Dipartimento di Scienze Biomediche Sperimentali e Cliniche Sezione di Scienze Biochimiche, Scuola di Scienze della Salute Umana Universita degli Studi di Firenze, Florence, Toscana, Italy.', 'Histopathology and Molecular Diagnostics, University Hospital Careggi, Florence, Toscana, Italy.', 'Institute of Pathological Anatomy and Histopathology Polytechnic University of the Marche Region, Ancona, Torrette, Italy.', 'Institute of Pathological Anatomy and Histopathology Polytechnic University of the Marche Region, Ancona, Torrette, Italy.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN, USA.', 'Unit of Anatomical Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Cordoba, Cordoba, Andalucia, Spain.', 'Institute of Pathological Anatomy and Histopathology Polytechnic University of the Marche Region, Ancona, Torrette, Italy.', 'BioIncept, LLC & The Society for the Investigation of Early Pregnancy (SIEP), New York, NY, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200511,United States,Int J Biol Markers,The International journal of biological markers,8712411,"['0 (Peptides)', '3K6A6FJ98O (preimplantation factor, synthetic)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry/*methods', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Peptides/*metabolism', 'Prostatectomy/*methods', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/*immunology']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Gleason score', 'Prostate cancer', 'cancer aggressiveness', 'immunohistochemistry', 'preimplantation factor (PIF)']",2020/05/12 06:00,2021/01/14 06:00,['2020/05/12 06:00'],"['2020/05/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/14 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/12 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/1724600820919969 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Biol Markers. 2020 Jun;35(2):82-90. doi: 10.1177/1724600820919969.

METHODS: Papers were identified by searching Medline and Google Scholar, reference lists/citations and contacting key authors, with no date or language restrictions. Inclusion criteria were as follows: leukaemia, HSCT+TBI, aged </= 24 years at HSCT and changes in body composition (total fat, central adiposity, adipose tissue function, muscle mass, muscle function). Quality was assessed using a brief Newcastle-Ottawa scale. RESULTS: Of 900 papers, 20 were included: seven controlled, five uncontrolled studies and eight case reports. Study quality appeared good. There was little evidence of differences in total fat/weight for HSCT + TBI groups (compared to healthy controls/population norms/short stature controls). There was some evidence of significantly higher central adiposity and differences in adipose tissue function (compared to leukaemic/non-leukaemic controls). Muscle mass was significantly lower (compared to healthy/obese controls). Muscle function results were inconclusive but suggested impairment. Case reports confirmed a lipodystrophic phenotype. CONCLUSIONS: Early remodelling of adipose tissue and loss of skeletal muscle are evident following HSCT + TBI for CTYA leukaemia, with extreme phenotype of overt lipodystrophy. There is some evidence for reduced muscle effectiveness. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: Body composition changes in patients after HSCT + TBI are apparent by early adult life and link with the risk of excess cardiometabolic morbidity seen in adult survivors. Interventions to improve muscle and/or adipose function, perhaps utilizing nutritional manipulation and/or targeted activity, should be investigated.","['Lorenc, Ava', 'Hamilton-Shield, Julian', 'Perry, Rachel', 'Stevens, Michael']","['Lorenc A', 'Hamilton-Shield J', 'Perry R', 'Stevens M']","['NIHR Bristol Biomedical Research Centre (Nutrition Theme), Level 3, University Hospitals Bristol Education and Research Centre, Upper Maudlin Street, Bristol, BS2 8AE, UK.', 'NIHR Bristol Biomedical Research Centre (Nutrition Theme), Level 3, University Hospitals Bristol Education and Research Centre, Upper Maudlin Street, Bristol, BS2 8AE, UK.', 'NIHR Bristol Biomedical Research Centre (Nutrition Theme), Level 3, University Hospitals Bristol Education and Research Centre, Upper Maudlin Street, Bristol, BS2 8AE, UK.', 'NIHR Bristol Biomedical Research Centre (Nutrition Theme), Level 3, University Hospitals Bristol Education and Research Centre, Upper Maudlin Street, Bristol, BS2 8AE, UK. m.stevens@bristol.ac.uk.']",['eng'],"['215859/Z/19/Z/WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', 'DH_/Department of Health/United Kingdom']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Systematic Review']",20200718,United States,J Cancer Surviv,Journal of cancer survivorship : research and practice,101307557,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Body Composition', 'Cancer Survivors/*statistics & numerical data', 'Child', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/pathology/*therapy', 'Obesity/*etiology/pathology', 'Whole-Body Irradiation/*adverse effects', 'Young Adult']",PMC7473918,['NOTNLM'],"['*Adipose tissue', '*Leukaemia', '*Lipodystrophy', '*Sarcopenia', '*Stem cell transplantation']",2020/05/11 06:00,2021/02/02 06:00,['2020/05/11 06:00'],"['2019/11/25 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/02 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/11 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s11764-020-00871-1 [doi]', '10.1007/s11764-020-00871-1 [pii]']",ppublish,J Cancer Surviv. 2020 Oct;14(5):624-642. doi: 10.1007/s11764-020-00871-1.

Treatment with dasatinib, a second-generation Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor, was initiated, and complete cytogenetic remission was achieved. Two years later, proteinuria occurred, and the urinary protein level increased gradually in the next 3 years. Moreover, the serum creatinine level increased mildly during this period. The urinary protein level reached 2.18 g/gCr; hence, a renal biopsy was conducted. Light microscopy revealed mild proliferation of mesangial cells, and immunofluorescence analysis revealed IgG and C3 depositions in the mesangial area. Electron microscopy revealed electron-dense deposition in the paramesangial area, partial podocyte foot process effacement, and segmental endothelial cell swelling with a slight expansion of the subendothelial space. Dasatinib was discontinued, and within 3 weeks, the proteinuria disappeared, with improvements in her renal function.

However, data on their role in patients undergoing autologous stem cell transplantation (Auto-SCT) as post-remission therapy (PRT) are limited. We therefore sought to retrospectively evaluate the role of FLT3-ITD and NPM1 in a cohort of AML patients (n = 405) with intermediate-risk cytogenetics, autografted in first complete remission (CR1). Patients were transplanted between 2000 and 2014 and reported to the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) registry. Leukemia-free survival (LFS) was the primary outcome. Median follow-up was 5.5 years. FLT3-ITD(neg)/NPM1(WT) was the leading molecular subtype (50%), followed by FLT3-ITD(neg)/NPM1(mut) (30%). In the univariate analysis, molecular subtype was associated with LFS, overall survival (OS), and relapse incidence (RI) (p < 0.001); 5-year LFS: FLT3-ITD(neg)/NPM1(mut) 62%, FLT3-ITD(pos)/NPM1(mut) 38%, FLT3-ITD(neg)/NPM1(WT) 32%, and FLT3-ITD(pos)/NPM1(WT) 21%. At 5 years, OS and RI in the FLT3-ITD(neg)/NPM1(mut) subtype were 74% and 35%, respectively. The corresponding OS and RI in other subtypes were below 48% and over 57%. In a Cox multivariable model, molecular subtype was the strongest predictor of LFS, OS, and relapse. In conclusion, AML patients with intermediate-risk cytogenetics and FLT3-ITD(neg)/NPM1(mut) experience favorable outcomes when autografted in CR1, suggesting that Auto-SCT is a valid PRT option.","['Shouval, Roni', 'Labopin, Myriam', 'Bomze, David', 'Baerlocher, Gabriela M', 'Capria, Saveria', 'Blaise, Didier', 'Hanel, Mathias', 'Forcade, Edouard', 'Huynh, Anne', 'Saccardi, Riccardo', 'Milone, Giuseppe', 'Zuckerman, Tsila', 'Remenyi, Peter', 'Versluis, Jurjen', 'Esteve, Jordi', 'Gorin, Norbert Claude', 'Mohty, Mohamad', 'Nagler, Arnon']","['Shouval R', 'Labopin M', 'Bomze D', 'Baerlocher GM', 'Capria S', 'Blaise D', 'Hanel M', 'Forcade E', 'Huynh A', 'Saccardi R', 'Milone G', 'Zuckerman T', 'Remenyi P', 'Versluis J', 'Esteve J', 'Gorin NC', 'Mohty M', 'Nagler A']","['Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Division, Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel-Hashomer, Sackler School of Medicine, Tel-Aviv University, Tel-Aviv, Israel. shouval@gmail.com.', 'Dr. Pinchas Bornstein Talpiot Medical Leadership Program, Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel-Hashomer, Israel. shouval@gmail.com.', 'Acute Leukemia Working Party of EBMT, Paris, France.', 'Universite Pierre et Marie Curie, Paris, France.', 'Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Division, Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel-Hashomer, Sackler School of Medicine, Tel-Aviv University, Tel-Aviv, Israel.', 'Department of Hematology, Inselspital, Bern University Hospital, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland.', 'Hematology, Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology, Sapienza University, Policlinico Umberto I, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology, Institut Paoli Calmettes, Marseille, France.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology, Stem Cell Transplantation, Hospital Chemnitz, Chemnitz, Germany.', 'Hematologie Clinique et Therapie cellulaire, CHU Bordeaux, Pessac, France.', 'CHU Toulouse, IUCT-Oncopole, Toulouse, France.', 'AOUC Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Careggi, Florence, Italy.', 'Ospedale Ferrarotto, Catania, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Rambam Health Care Campus, Haifa, Israel.', 'St. Istvan and St. Laszlo Hospital of Budapest, Budapest, Hungary.', 'Department of Hematology, Erasmus University Medical Center Cancer Institute, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Hematology Department, Hospital Clinic de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'EBMT Paris study office / CEREST-TC, Saint Antoine Hospital, Paris, France.', 'Hospital Saint-Antoine, APHP, Sorbonne University, INSERM U938, Paris, France.', 'Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Division, Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel-Hashomer, Sackler School of Medicine, Tel-Aviv University, Tel-Aviv, Israel.', 'Acute Leukemia Working Party of EBMT, Paris, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200510,England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,"['0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/therapy', 'Mutation', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Assessment', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics']",,,,2020/05/11 06:00,2021/06/22 06:00,['2020/05/11 06:00'],"['2019/11/22 00:00 [received]', '2020/04/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/04/27 00:00 [revised]', '2020/05/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/22 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/11 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41409-020-0936-z [doi]', '10.1038/s41409-020-0936-z [pii]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2020 Dec;55(12):2244-2253. doi: 10.1038/s41409-020-0936-z.

Most patients have palpable lymphadenopathy, while 20-50% of the patients have hepatosplenomegaly. Cutaneous infiltrations in patients with CLL can be localized or generalized in the form of erythematous papules, plaques, nodules and, ulceration, which is uncommon. CASE REPORT We present the case of a 71-year-old man diagnosed with chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL) with atypical immunophenotype and increased prolymphocytes (CLL/PLL), which was treated initially after white blood counts (WBC) doubling with Bendamustine and Rituximab for 6 cycles, and achieved complete remission. The patient relapsed after 6 months of completion of treatment, with multiple large subcutaneous masses, proved to be infiltration with the same atypical CLL/SLL on tissue biopsy, with pathologic features indicating disease progression. The lack of similar reported cases, and the aggressiveness of the tumor clinically and histopathologically, resulted in the decision to treat with Rituximab, Cyclophosphamide, Doxorubicin, Vincristine, and Prednisolone (R-CHOP) as a case of aggressive lymphoma, with complete remission clinically and radiologically. CONCLUSIONS We present a rare case of subcutaneous extramedullary masses of atypical CLL/SLL. The high proliferation index (Ki-67) and the increase of large cells are suggestive of aggressive progression of the disease; however, no frank features of Richter's transformation were noted. Based on this and because of the unusual aggressive-looking skin masses, the panel decided to treat the patient with R-CHOP. The impact of this presentation on the prognosis of the disease is not clear. To date, our patient has responded well to treatment with R-CHOP, with complete remission of the subcutaneous masses and on PET scan, but further follow-up is needed.","['Aldapt, Mahmood B', 'Soliman, Dina', 'Szabados, Lajos', 'Sharaf Eldean, Mouhammad Z', 'Shwaylia, Hawraa M', 'Abdulla, Mohammad A J', 'Yassin, Mohamed A']","['Aldapt MB', 'Soliman D', 'Szabados L', 'Sharaf Eldean MZ', 'Shwaylia HM', 'Abdulla MAJ', 'Yassin MA']","['Department of Hematology, National Center for Cancer Care and Research, Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar.', 'Department of Hematopathology and Laboratory Medicine, Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar.', 'National Cancer Institute, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Department of Radiology, National Center for Cancer Care and Research, Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar.', 'Department of Histopathology and Laboratory Medicine, Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar.', 'Department of Hematology, National Center for Cancer Care and Research, Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar.', 'Department of Hematology, National Center for Cancer Care and Research, Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar.', 'Department of Hematology, National Center for Cancer Care and Research, Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20200510,United States,Am J Case Rep,The American journal of case reports,101489566,"['0 (R-CHOP protocol)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols', 'Cyclophosphamide', 'Disease Progression', 'Doxorubicin', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/*pathology', '*Leukemic Infiltration', 'Male', 'Prednisone', 'Remission Induction', 'Rituximab', 'Subcutaneous Tissue/*pathology', 'Vincristine']",PMC7244225,,,2020/05/11 06:00,2021/01/06 06:00,['2020/05/11 06:00'],"['2020/05/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/05/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/06 06:00 [medline]']","['920411 [pii]', '10.12659/AJCR.920411 [doi]']",epublish,Am J Case Rep. 2020 May 10;21:e920411. doi: 10.12659/AJCR.920411.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the antiproliferative potential of a ferrulic acid derivative, 8,8-bis-(dihydroconiferyl)-diferulate (DHCF2) on a panel of 18 cancer cell lines, including various sensitive and drug-resistant phenotypes, belonging to human and animals. The mode of induction of cell death by this compound was further studied. METHODS: The antiproliferative activity, autophagy, ferroptotic and necroptotic cell death were evaluated by the resazurin reduction assay (RRA). CCRF-CEM leukemia cells were used for all mechanistic studies. A caspase-Glo assay was applied to evaluate the activity of caspases. Cell cycle analysis (PI staining), apoptosis (annexin V/PI staining), mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) (JC-1) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) (H2DCFH-DA) were assessed by flow cytometry. RESULTS: DHCF2 demonstrated impressive cytotoxic effects towards the 18 cancer cell lines tested, with IC50 values all below 6.5 microM. The obtained IC50 values were in the range of 1.17 microM (towards CCRF-CEM leukemia cells) to 6.34 microM (towards drug-resistant HCT116 p53(-/-) human colon adenocarcinoma cells) for DHCF2 and from 0.02 microM (against CCRF-CEM cells) to 122.96 microM (against multidrug-resistant CEM/ADR5000 leukemia cells) for the reference drug, doxorubicin. DHCF2 had IC50 values lower than those of doxorubicin, against CEM/ADR5000 cells and on some melanoma cell lines, such as MaMel-80a cells, Mel-2a cells, MV3 cells and SKMel-505 cells. DHCF2 induced autophagy as well as apoptosis in CCRF-CEM cells though caspases activation, MMP alteration and increase of ROS production. CONCLUSION: The studied diferulic acid, DHCF2, is a promising antiproliferative compound. It deserves further indepth investigations with the ultimate aim to develop a novel drug to fight cancer drug resistance.","['Mbaveng, Armelle T', 'Damen, Francois', 'Guefack, Michel-Gael F', 'Tankeo, Simplice Beaudelaire', 'Abdelfatah, Sara', 'Bitchagno, Gabin T M', 'Celik, Ilhami', 'Kuete, Victor', 'Efferth, Thomas']","['Mbaveng AT', 'Damen F', 'Guefack MF', 'Tankeo SB', 'Abdelfatah S', 'Bitchagno GTM', 'Celik I', 'Kuete V', 'Efferth T']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Biology, Institute of Pharmacy and Biochemistry, University of Mainz, Staudinger Weg 5, 55128 Mainz, Germany; Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Science, University of Dschang, P.O.

The use of mass spectrometry-based approaches (immunopeptidomics) can provide powerful new avenues for the identification of such epitopes. In this study we report the use of complementary peptide antigen enrichment methods and a comprehensive mass spectrometric acquisition strategy to provide in-depth immunopeptidome data for the THP-1 cell line, a cell line used widely as a model of human leukaemia. To accomplish this, we combined robust experimental workflows that incorporated ultrafiltration or off-line reversed phase chromatography to enrich peptide ligand as well as a multifaceted data acquisition strategy using an Orbitrap Fusion LC-MS instrument. Using the combined datasets from the two ligand enrichment methods we gained significant depth in immunopeptidome coverage by identifying a total of 41,816 HLA class I peptides from THP-1 cells, including a significant number of peptides derived from different oncogenes or over expressed proteins associated with cancer. The physicochemical properties of the HLA-bound peptides dictated their recovery using the two ligand enrichment approaches and their distribution across the different precursor charge states considered in the data acquisition strategy. The data highlight the complementarity of the two enrichment procedures, and in cases where sample is not limiting, suggest that the combination of both approaches will yield the most comprehensive immunopeptidome information.","['Pandey, Kirti', 'Mifsud, Nicole A', 'Lim Kam Sian, Terry C C', 'Ayala, Rochelle', 'Ternette, Nicola', 'Ramarathinam, Sri H', 'Purcell, Anthony W']","['Pandey K', 'Mifsud NA', 'Lim Kam Sian TCC', 'Ayala R', 'Ternette N', 'Ramarathinam SH', 'Purcell AW']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology and Infection and Immunity Program, Biomedicine Discovery Institute, Monash University, Clayton 3800, VIC, Australia.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology and Infection and Immunity Program, Biomedicine Discovery Institute, Monash University, Clayton 3800, VIC, Australia.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology and Infection and Immunity Program, Biomedicine Discovery Institute, Monash University, Clayton 3800, VIC, Australia.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology and Infection and Immunity Program, Biomedicine Discovery Institute, Monash University, Clayton 3800, VIC, Australia.', 'The Jenner Institute, Mass Spectrometry Laboratory, University of Oxford, Oxford OX3 7FZ, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology and Infection and Immunity Program, Biomedicine Discovery Institute, Monash University, Clayton 3800, VIC, Australia.

A decline in donor chimerism may herald an impending relapse and therefore, early recognition and intervention plays an important role in such cases. A 32 year old male patient diagnosed as a case of Philadelphia positive mixed phenotypic acute leukaemia underwent peripheral blood hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) with his sibling as donor. During follow-up, a fall in donor chimerism was observed from 91.86% on day +37 to 88.83% on day +57 and 85.34% on day +77. Donor Lymphocyte Infusion (DLI) was harvested via apheresis. A dose of 1 x 10(6) per kg was infused and the rest was cryopreserved in aliquots of escalating doses. On day +102, he presented with biopsy proven acute mucocutaneous GVHD grade 2 which was managed conservatively and donor chimerism of 57.99%. On day +126, a repeat donor chimerism was performed which showed 100% chimerism. He continues to do well at day +161. Timely use of DLI can improve donor chimerism in patients with Philadelphia positive acute leukaemia who tend to relapse after HSCT.","['Pandey, Prashant', 'Setya, Divya', 'Kaul, Esha', 'Ranjan, Shweta', 'Kumar, Praveen']","['Pandey P', 'Setya D', 'Kaul E', 'Ranjan S', 'Kumar P']","['Department of Transfusion Medicine, Histocompatibility and Molecular Biology, Jaypee hospital, Sector-128, Noida, 201304, India.

Thus, there is a great need for developing novel, safe and effective drugs for the treatment of melanoma. Hispolon is a small molecular weight polyphenol derived from Phellinus linteus, which has antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-proliferative activities. Hispolon has been reported to induce apoptosis in gastric cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, and myeloid leukemia. However, the anticancer effect in melanoma is not well elucidated. Thus, our present study was to investigate the anti-cancer effect of hispolon on melanoma cancer cells. B16BL6 cells were treated with different concentrations of hispolon for 24 h and the effect on oxidative stress, mitochondrial functions, apoptosis and cell proliferation were studied. Hispolon is a potent generator of reactive oxygen species, nitrite and lipid peroxide levels. Furthermore, it significantly inhibits the expression of Bcl-2 and promotes the expression of Bax, increases the activity of caspase 1 and 3, inhibits mitochondrial Complex I and IV activities. By the above mechanisms, hispolon dose-dependently exhibited the antimelanoma effect similar to the well established pharmacological agent, curcumin. Thus, hispolon can be a potent anti-melanoma drug in the future if the pharmacodynamic effects and the toxicological studies are appropriately carried out.","['Al Saqr, Ahmed', 'Majrashi, Mohammed', 'Alrbyawi, Hamad', 'Govindarajulu, Manoj', 'Fujihashi, Ayaka', 'Gottumukkala, Subbaraju', 'Poudel, Ishwor', 'Arnold, Robert D', 'Babu, R Jayachandra', 'Dhanasekaran, Muralikrishnan']","['Al Saqr A', 'Majrashi M', 'Alrbyawi H', 'Govindarajulu M', 'Fujihashi A', 'Gottumukkala S', 'Poudel I', 'Arnold RD', 'Babu RJ', 'Dhanasekaran M']","['Department of Drug Discovery and Development, Harrison School of Pharmacy, Auburn University, AL 36849; Department of Pharmaceutics, College of Pharmacy, Prince Sattam Bin Abdulaziz University, Alkharj, Saudi Arabia.', 'Department of Drug Discovery and Development, Harrison School of Pharmacy, Auburn University, AL 36849; Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.', 'Department of Drug Discovery and Development, Harrison School of Pharmacy, Auburn University, AL 36849; Pharmaceutics and Pharmaceutical Technology Department, College of Pharmacy, Taibah University, Saudi Arabia.', 'Department of Drug Discovery and Development, Harrison School of Pharmacy, Auburn University, AL 36849.', 'Department of Drug Discovery and Development, Harrison School of Pharmacy, Auburn University, AL 36849.', 'NATSOL Laboratories Private Limited, Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh, India.', 'Department of Drug Discovery and Development, Harrison School of Pharmacy, Auburn University, AL 36849.', 'Department of Drug Discovery and Development, Harrison School of Pharmacy, Auburn University, AL 36849.', 'Department of Drug Discovery and Development, Harrison School of Pharmacy, Auburn University, AL 36849.

Its role in tumorigenesis is highly implicated. Sixty-three splice variants of this gene have been identified so far, with significant differences in expression patterns between various cancer cell lines. Presently, little is known regarding the regulation of expression of the BCL2L12 gene. For the vast majority of BCL2L12 gene splice variants, the 5'- and 3'-untranslated regions as well as their transcriptional regulation have not been determined yet. The aim of this study was to get insight into the regulation of the BCL2L12 gene transcription in human chronic myelogenous leukemia (K562) cell line. Our results point to the activity of novel transcription start site of the BCL2L12 gene and indicate that Sp1 and GATA-1 transcription factors could be involved in the regulation of BCL2L12 gene expression in K562 cells. The previously reported active promoter of BCL2L12 gene differs from the one we described in our study. If this novel BCL2L12 promoter is confirmed to be active in other malignancies, transcripts generated from this region could be considered as new cancer-specific biomarkers. The results of our study contribute to the better understanding of the transcriptional regulation of the BCL2L12 gene.","['Nikcevic, Gordana', 'Drazilov, Sanja Srzentic', 'Djurasevic, Teodora Karan', 'Tosic, Natasa', 'Kontos, Christos K', 'Scorilas, Andreas', 'Pavlovic, Sonja']","['Nikcevic G', 'Drazilov SS', 'Djurasevic TK', 'Tosic N', 'Kontos CK', 'Scorilas A', 'Pavlovic S']","['Institute of Molecular Genetics and Genetic Engineering, University of Belgrade, Belgrade, Serbia.', 'Institute of Molecular Genetics and Genetic Engineering, University of Belgrade, Belgrade, Serbia.', 'Institute of Molecular Genetics and Genetic Engineering, University of Belgrade, Belgrade, Serbia.', 'Institute of Molecular Genetics and Genetic Engineering, University of Belgrade, Belgrade, Serbia.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Faculty of Biology, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Athens, Greece.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Faculty of Biology, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Athens, Greece.', 'Institute of Molecular Genetics and Genetic Engineering, University of Belgrade, Belgrade, Serbia.

SPs possess functional domains (SAND, PHD, bromodomain) that dock to DNA or post-translationally modified histones and a caspase activation and recruitment domain (CARD) to promote multimerization. Mutations within immune expressed SPs associate with numerous immunological diseases including Crohn's disease, multiple sclerosis, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, veno-occlusive disease with immunodeficiency, as well as Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, underscoring their importance in immune regulation.

Life-threatening fungal infections mainly occur in immunocompromised patients, and are typically caused by environmental opportunists that take advantage of a weakened immune system. The filamentous fungus Aspergillus fumigatus is the most important and well-documented mold pathogen of humans, causing a number of complex respiratory diseases, including invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, an often fatal disease in patients with acute leukemia or in immunosuppressed bone marrow or solid organ transplant recipients. However, non-Aspergillus molds are increasingly reported as agents of disseminated diseases, with Fusarium, Scedosporium, Lomentospora and mucormycete species now firmly established as pathogens of immunosuppressed and immunocompetent individuals. Despite well-documented risk factors for invasive fungal diseases, and increased awareness of the risk factors for life-threatening infections, the number of deaths attributable to molds is likely to be severely underestimated driven, to a large extent, by the lack of readily accessible, cheap, and accurate tests that allow detection and differentiation of infecting species. Early diagnosis is critical to patient survival but, unlike Aspergillus diseases, where a number of CE-marked or FDA-approved biomarker tests are now available for clinical diagnosis, similar tests for fusariosis, scedosporiosis and mucormycosis remain experimental, with detection reliant on insensitive and slow culture of pathogens from invasive bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, tissue biopsy, or from blood. This review examines the ecology, epidemiology, and contemporary methods of detection of these mold pathogens, and the obstacles to diagnostic test development and translation of novel biomarkers to the clinical setting.","['Thornton, Christopher R']",['Thornton CR'],"['Biosciences, Hatherly Laboratories, University of Exeter, Exeter, United Kingdom.

Despite the innate toxicity challenge associated with SERCA inhibition, we identified CAD204520, a small molecule with better drug-like properties and reduced off-target Ca(2+) toxicity compared with the SERCA inhibitor thapsigargin. In this work, we describe the properties and complex structure of CAD204520 and show that CAD204520 preferentially targets mutated over wild-type NOTCH1 proteins in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). Uniquely among SERCA inhibitors, CAD204520 suppresses NOTCH1-mutated leukemic cells in a T-ALL xenografted model without causing cardiac toxicity.

How survivors engage in physical activity remains unclear, potentially increasing CVD risk. We assessed survivors' physical activity levels, barriers and enablers, fitness, and identified predictors of fitness and physical activity stage of change. METHODS: Childhood cancer survivors (CCS; 8-18 years old) >/=1 year post-treatment were assessed for aerobic fitness (6-min walk test), used to extrapolate VO2max , and body composition (InBody 570). Survivors self-reported physical activity to determine stage of change (Patient-Centered Assessment and Counselling for Exercise). Physical activity and fitness were compared with guidelines and CVD-risk cut-points (VO2max < 42 mL/kg/min: males; VO2max < 35 mL/kg/min: females). Multiple regression and mediator-moderator analysis were used to identify fitness predictors and stage of change. RESULTS: One hundred two survivors (12.8 +/- 3.3 years) participated (46% acute lymphoblastic leukaemia). Forty percent of males (VO2max = 43.3 +/- 6.3 mL/kg/min) and 28% of females (VO2max = 36.5 +/- 5.9 mL/kg/min) were in the CVD-risk category, while 25% met physical activity guidelines. Most prevalent physical activity barriers were fatigue (52%), preferring television instead of exercise (38%), and lacking time (34%). Predictive factors for reduced fitness included being older, female, higher waist-to-height ratio, higher screen time, and moderated by lower physical activity (r(2) = 0.91, P < .001). Survivors with higher physical activity stage of change were male, lower body fat percentage, lower screen time, and lived with both parents (r = 0.42, P = .003). CONCLUSION: Aerobic fitness and physical activity of CCS is low compared with population norms, potentially increasing CVD risk. Addressing physical activity barriers and enablers, including reducing screen time, could promote regular physical activity, reducing CVD risk.","['Mizrahi, David', 'Wakefield, Claire E', 'Simar, David', 'Ha, Lauren', 'McBride, James', 'Field, Penelope', 'Cohn, Richard J', 'Fardell, Joanna E']","['Mizrahi D', 'Wakefield CE', 'Simar D', 'Ha L', 'McBride J', 'Field P', 'Cohn RJ', 'Fardell JE']","['UNSW Medicine, UNSW, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.', ""Behavioural Sciences Unit, Kids Cancer Centre, Sydney Children's Hospital, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia."", 'UNSW Medicine, UNSW, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.', ""Behavioural Sciences Unit, Kids Cancer Centre, Sydney Children's Hospital, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia."", 'UNSW Medicine, UNSW, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.', 'UNSW Medicine, UNSW, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.', ""Behavioural Sciences Unit, Kids Cancer Centre, Sydney Children's Hospital, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia."", ""Respiratory Medicine, Sydney Children's Hospital, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia."", ""Respiratory Medicine, Sydney Children's Hospital, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia."", 'UNSW Medicine, UNSW, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.', ""Behavioural Sciences Unit, Kids Cancer Centre, Sydney Children's Hospital, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia."", 'UNSW Medicine, UNSW, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.', ""Behavioural Sciences Unit, Kids Cancer Centre, Sydney Children's Hospital, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200509,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Cancer Survivors/*psychology/statistics & numerical data', 'Child', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', '*Exercise', 'Fatigue/*physiopathology', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Male', '*Muscle Strength', 'Neoplasms/physiopathology/psychology/*rehabilitation', 'Prognosis', '*Quality of Life', 'Risk Factors']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*VO2max', '*aerobic fitness', '*barriers', '*childhood cancer survivors', '*exercise', '*physical activity', '*survivorship']",2020/05/10 06:00,2020/08/25 06:00,['2020/05/10 06:00'],"['2020/01/27 00:00 [received]', '2020/04/01 00:00 [revised]', '2020/04/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/05/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/25 06:00 [medline]', '2020/05/10 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.28339 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2020 Jul;67(7):e28339. doi: 10.1002/pbc.28339.
