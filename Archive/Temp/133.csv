METHODS: We collected and evaluated all relevant 1993 to 2007 publications. Summary estimates were obtained using various weighting schemes. To explore sources of heterogeneity, study characteristics were examined using regression analysis. RESULTS: Overall, for new studies, both brain cancer and leukemia showed small increases in risk estimates, 10% and 13%, respectively. Notably, pooled risk estimates were lower than in past meta-analyses, and leukemia subtypes showed no consistent pattern when past and present meta-analyses were compared. CONCLUSIONS: The lack of a clear pattern of EMF exposure and outcome risk does not support a hypothesis that these exposures are responsible for the observed excess risk. Findings were not sensitive to assumptions, influential studies, weighting schemes, publication bias, study characteristics, or funding source.","['Kheifets, Leeka', 'Monroe, Jason', 'Vergara, Ximena', 'Mezei, Gabor', 'Afifi, Abdelmonem A']","['Kheifets L', 'Monroe J', 'Vergara X', 'Mezei G', 'Afifi AA']","['Department of Epidemiology, UCLA School of Public Health, Los Angeles, CA, USA. kheifets@ucla.edu']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,J Occup Environ Med,Journal of occupational and environmental medicine,9504688,,IM,"['Adult', 'Brain Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Causality', 'Confidence Intervals', '*Electromagnetic Fields', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/classification/*epidemiology', 'Occupational Exposure/*statistics & numerical data', 'Occupations/classification/statistics & numerical data', 'Risk Assessment']",2008/06/12 09:00,2009/01/29 09:00,['2008/06/12 09:00'],"['2008/06/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/29 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/12 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/JOM.0b013e3181757a27 [doi]', '00043764-200806000-00010 [pii]']",ppublish,J Occup Environ Med. 2008 Jun;50(6):677-88. doi: 10.1097/JOM.0b013e3181757a27.,6,45,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MTIs may increase degradation of cyclin D1, a protein involved in dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) synthesis. Because resistance to methotrexate may correlate with high DHFR expression, we hypothesized MTIs may increase sensitivity of ALL to methotrexate through decreasing DHFR by increasing turn-over of cyclin D1. We tested this hypothesis using multiple ALL cell lines and nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient (NOD/SCID) mice xenografted with human ALL. We found MTIs and methotrexate were synergistic in combination in vitro and in vivo. Mice treated with both drugs went into a complete and durable remission whereas single agent treatment caused an initial partial response that ultimately progressed. ALL cells treated with MTIs had markedly decreased expression of DHFR and cyclin D1, providing a novel mechanistic explanation for a combined effect.

Lapatinib inhibited radiation-induced activation of ERBB1/2, extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2, and AKT, and radiosensitized HCT116 cells. Prolonged incubation of HCT116 cells with lapatinib caused cell killing followed by outgrowth of lapatinib-adapted cells. Adapted cells were resistant to serum starvation-induced cell killing and were cross-resistant to multiple therapeutic drugs. Lapatinib was competent to inhibit basal and epidermal growth factor (EGF)-stimulated ERBB1 phosphorylation in adapted cells. Coexpression of dominant-negative ERBB1 and dominant-negative ERBB2 inhibited basal and EGF-stimulated ERBB1 and ERBB2 phosphorylation in parental and adapted cells. However, in neither parental nor adapted cells did expression of dominant-negative ERBB1 and dominant-negative ERBB2 recapitulate the cell death-promoting effects of lapatinib. Adapted cells had increased expression of MCL-1, decreased expression of BAX, and decreased activation of BAX and BAK. Overexpression of BCL-XL protected parental cells from lapatinib toxicity. Knockdown of MCL-1 expression enhanced lapatinib toxicity in adapted cells that was reverted by knockdown of BAK expression. Inhibition of caspase function modestly reduced lapatinib toxicity in parental cells, whereas knockdown of apoptosis-inducing factor expression suppressed lapatinib toxicity. Thus, in HCT116 cells, lapatinib adaptation can be mediated by altered expression of pro- and antiapoptotic proteins that maintain mitochondrial function.","['Martin, Aditi Pandya', 'Miller, Anna', 'Emad, Luni', 'Rahmani, Mohammed', 'Walker, Teneille', 'Mitchell, Clint', 'Hagan, Michael P', 'Park, Margaret A', 'Yacoub, Adly', 'Fisher, Paul B', 'Grant, Steven', 'Dent, Paul']","['Martin AP', 'Miller A', 'Emad L', 'Rahmani M', 'Walker T', 'Mitchell C', 'Hagan MP', 'Park MA', 'Yacoub A', 'Fisher PB', 'Grant S', 'Dent P']","['Department of Biochemistry, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA 23298-0035, USA.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,"['0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Quinazolines)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein)', '0VUA21238F (Lapatinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (EGFR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ErbB Receptors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, ErbB-2)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, ErbB-3)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)']",IM,"['Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'ErbB Receptors/*genetics', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/metabolism', 'HCT116 Cells', 'Humans', 'Lapatinib', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'Quinazolines/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'Receptor, ErbB-2/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Receptor, ErbB-3/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics', 'bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein/*metabolism']",2008/06/12 09:00,2008/09/19 09:00,['2008/06/12 09:00'],"['2008/06/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/19 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/12 09:00 [entrez]']","['mol.108.047365 [pii]', '10.1124/mol.108.047365 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 2008 Sep;74(3):807-22. doi: 10.1124/mol.108.047365.

In this study, we identified four novel functional splice variants of ULBPs including ULBP4-I, ULBP4-II, ULBP4-III and RAET1G3 in HepG2 liver carcinoma cells, WISH human amnion cells, Hep-2 larynx carcinoma cells and K562 leukemia cells, respectively, by reverse transcription-PCR and T vector cloning strategy. Analysis of alignments of amino acid sequences of the splice variants illustrated that there were important modifications between splice variants and their individual parental ULBP. All ULBP4 splice variants (ULBP4-I, ULBP4-II and ULBP4-III) were type 1 membrane-spanning molecules and had the ability to bind with human NKG2D receptor in vitro. Ectopic expressions of ULBP4 and ULBP4 splice variants resulted in the enhanced cytotoxic sensitivity of target cells against NK cells, which could be blocked by anti-NKG2D mAb. Moreover, co-culture-free soluble forms of ULBP4 splice variants (their alpha1 + alpha2 ectodomains) and RAET1G3 (soluble splice variant of RAET1G2) with NK cells down-regulated the cell surface expression of NKG2D. Finally, immobilized in a plate-bound form of RAET1G3 stimulated NK cells to secrete IFN-gamma. Taken together, all the identified functional splice variants will help to advance our knowledge regarding the overall functions of ULBP gene family.","['Cao, Wei', 'Xi, Xueyan', 'Wang, Zhun', 'Dong, Liling', 'Hao, Zhiyong', 'Cui, Lianxian', 'Ma, Chi', 'He, Wei']","['Cao W', 'Xi X', 'Wang Z', 'Dong L', 'Hao Z', 'Cui L', 'Ma C', 'He W']","['Department of Immunology, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and School of Basic Medicine, Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100005, China. heweiimu@public.bta.net.cn']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Int Immunol,International immunology,8916182,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (KLRK1 protein, human)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily K)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (RAET1E protein, human)', '0 (RAET1G protein, human)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence/genetics', 'Carrier Proteins/*genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/genetics', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/*genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/genetics/metabolism', 'K562 Cells', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology/metabolism', 'Ligands', 'Lymphocyte Activation/genetics/immunology', 'Membrane Proteins/*genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily K/*agonists/biosynthesis/genetics/immunology', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Isoforms/genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/*genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Transfection']",2008/06/12 09:00,2009/06/20 09:00,['2008/06/12 09:00'],"['2008/06/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/12 09:00 [entrez]']","['dxn057 [pii]', '10.1093/intimm/dxn057 [doi]']",ppublish,Int Immunol. 2008 Aug;20(8):981-91. doi: 10.1093/intimm/dxn057.

Using two human acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell (CEM) clones with respective GC-sensitive and GC-resistant phenotypes, we discovered that the PKA regulatory subunit isoform RII(beta) is preferentially expressed in the GC-sensitive clone C7-14 cells, whereas other intracellular cAMP receptors, including the exchange proteins directly activated by cAMP (Epac), are expressed at similar levels in both GC-sensitive and GC-resistant clones. High RII(beta) expression level in C7-14 cells is associated with elevated total PKA cellular activity and cAMP sensitivity, which consequently lead to an increased basal PKA activity. cAMP analogs that selectively activate type II PKA recapitulate the effects of forskolin of promoting apoptosis and antagonizing AKT/PKB activity in both GC-sensitive and GC-resistant clones, whereas type I PKA-selective agonists do not. Furthermore, down-regulation of RII(beta) leads to increased AKT/PKB activation and enhanced GC resistance in C7-14 cells. These results demonstrate that PKA RII(beta) is responsible for increased GC sensitivity, critical for cAMP-mediated synergistic cell killing in CEM cells, and may represent a novel therapeutic target for GC-resistant lymphoid malignancy.","['Ji, Zhenyu', 'Mei, Fang C', 'Miller, Aaron L', 'Thompson, E Brad', 'Cheng, Xiaodong']","['Ji Z', 'Mei FC', 'Miller AL', 'Thompson EB', 'Cheng X']","['Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Sealy Center for Cancer Cell Biology, School of Medicine, The University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, Texas 77555-1031, USA.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinase RIIbeta Subunit)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Oncogene Protein v-akt)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclic AMP/*pharmacology', 'Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinase RIIbeta Subunit/genetics/*metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic/*drug effects', 'Glucocorticoids/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Oncogene Protein v-akt/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*enzymology/metabolism/*pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism']",2008/06/12 09:00,2008/09/18 09:00,['2008/06/12 09:00'],"['2008/06/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/18 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/12 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(20)66182-8 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M803193200 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2008 Aug 8;283(32):21920-5. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M803193200.

Although the mechanism of transformation and leukemogenesis is not fully elucidated, there is evidence to suggest that the viral oncoprotein Tax plays a crucial role in these processes through the regulation of several pathways including NF-kappaB and the cell cycle pathways. The observation that NF-kappaB, which is strongly induced by Tax, is indispensable for the maintenance of the malignant phenotype of HTLV-1 by regulating the expression of various genes involved in cell cycle regulation and inhibition of apoptosis provides a possible molecular target for these infected cells. To develop potential new therapeutic strategies for HTLV-1 infected cells, in this present study, we initially screened a battery of NF-kappaB and CDK inhibitors (total of 35 compounds) to examine their effects on the growth and survival of infected T-cell lines. Two drugs namely BMS-345541 and Purvalanol A exhibited higher levels of growth inhibition and apoptosis in infected cell as compared to uninfected cells. BMS-345541 inhibited IKKbeta kinase activity from HTLV-1 infected cells with an IC50 (the 50% of inhibitory concentration) value of 50 nM compared to 500 nM from control cells as measured by in vitro kinase assays. The effects of Purvalanol A were associated with suppression of CDK2/cyclin E complex activity as previously shown by us. Combination of both BMS-345541 and Purvalanol A showed a reduced level of HTLV-1 p19 Gag production in cell culture. The apparent apoptosis in these infected cells were associated with increased caspase-3 activity and PARP cleavage. The potent and selective apoptotic effects of these drugs suggest that both BMS-345541 and Purvalanol A, which target both NF-kappaB and CDK complex and the G1/S border, might be promising new agents in the treatment of these infected patients.","['Agbottah, Emmanuel', 'Yeh, Wen-I', 'Berro, Reem', 'Klase, Zachary', 'Pedati, Caitlin', 'Kehn-Hall, Kyleen', 'Wu, Weilin', 'Kashanchi, Fatah']","['Agbottah E', 'Yeh WI', 'Berro R', 'Klase Z', 'Pedati C', 'Kehn-Hall K', 'Wu W', 'Kashanchi F']","['Department of Microbiology, George Washington University School of Medicine, Washington, District of Columbia 20037, USA.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,AIDS Res Ther,AIDS research and therapy,101237921,,,,2008/06/12 09:00,2008/06/12 09:01,['2008/06/12 09:00'],"['2007/11/28 00:00 [received]', '2008/06/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/06/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/12 09:01 [medline]', '2008/06/12 09:00 [entrez]']","['1742-6405-5-12 [pii]', '10.1186/1742-6405-5-12 [doi]']",epublish,AIDS Res Ther. 2008 Jun 10;5:12. doi: 10.1186/1742-6405-5-12.,,,,"['R01 AI043894/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 AI065236/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",20080610,PMC2483717,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cell-based bone reconstruction therapies promise to offer new therapeutic opportunities for the repair of bone damaged by disease or injury. Currently, embryonic stem cells (ESCs) are discussed to be a potential cell source for bone tissue engineering. The purpose of this study was to investigate various supplements in culture media with respect to the induction of osteogenic differentiation. METHODS: Murine ESCs were cultured in the presence of LIF (leukemia inhibitory factor), DAG (dexamethasone, ascorbic acid and beta-glycerophosphate) or bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2). Microscopical analyses were performed using von Kossa staining, and expression of osteogenic marker genes was determined by real time PCR. RESULTS: ESCs cultured with DAG showed by far the largest deposition of calcium phosphate-containing minerals. Starting at day 9 of culture, a strong increase in collagen I mRNA expression was detected in the DAG-treated cells. In BMP-2-treated ESCs the collagen I mRNA induction was less increased. Expression of osteocalcin, a highly specific marker for osteogentic differentiation, showed a double-peaked curve in DAG-treated cells. ESCs cultured in the presence of DAG showed a strong increase in osteocalcin mRNA at day 9 followed by a second peak starting at day 17. CONCLUSION: Supplementation of ESC cell cultures with DAG is effective in inducing osteogenic differentiation and appears to be more potent than stimulation with BMP-2 alone. Thus, DAG treatment can be recommended for generating ESC populations with osteogenic differentiation that are intended for use in bone tissue engineering.","['Handschel, Jorg', 'Berr, Karin', 'Depprich, Rita A', 'Kubler, Norbert R', 'Naujoks, Christian', 'Wiesmann, Hans-Peter', 'Ommerborn, Michelle A', 'Meyer, Ulrich']","['Handschel J', 'Berr K', 'Depprich RA', 'Kubler NR', 'Naujoks C', 'Wiesmann HP', 'Ommerborn MA', 'Meyer U']","['Department for Cranio- and Maxillofacial Surgery, Heinrich-Heine-University Dusseldorf, Moorenstr, 5, 40225 Dusseldorf, Germany. handschel@t-online.de']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Head Face Med,Head & face medicine,101245792,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Bmp2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Bone Morphogenetic Protein 2)', '0 (Bone Morphogenetic Proteins)', '0 (Glycerophosphates)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '104982-03-8 (Osteocalcin)', '106441-73-0 (Osteopontin)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'EC 3.1.3.1 (Alkaline Phosphatase)', 'PQ6CK8PD0R (Ascorbic Acid)']",IM,"['Alkaline Phosphatase/biosynthesis', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD34/biosynthesis', 'Ascorbic Acid/pharmacology', 'Biomarkers', 'Bone Morphogenetic Protein 2', 'Bone Morphogenetic Proteins/pharmacology', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', 'Down-Regulation', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/*drug effects', 'Gene Expression', 'Glycerophosphates/pharmacology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Osteocalcin/biosynthesis', 'Osteogenesis/*drug effects', 'Osteopontin/biosynthesis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tissue Engineering', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/pharmacology']",2008/06/12 09:00,2008/08/09 09:00,['2008/06/12 09:00'],"['2007/07/30 00:00 [received]', '2008/06/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/06/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/09 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/12 09:00 [entrez]']","['1746-160X-4-10 [pii]', '10.1186/1746-160X-4-10 [doi]']",epublish,Head Face Med. 2008 Jun 10;4:10. doi: 10.1186/1746-160X-4-10.,,,,,20080610,PMC2443118,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have investigated the role of HLA-DPB1 allele matching in HSCT outcomes in 161 recipients who were HLA-A, -B, -C, -DRB1 and -DQB1-matched with their unrelated donors at the allelic level (10/10). In addition, we analysed the association of polymorphic amino acid mismatches of DPB1 molecule with HSCT end-points, and a previously published permissiveness concept. HLA-DPB1 allele mismatches were significantly associated with an increased incidence of acute graft-versus-host disease (aGvHD) and worse overall survival (OS). The mismatch at amino acid position 69 significantly increased the risk for transplant-related mortality (TRM). Risk factors for aGvHD also included mismatches at positions 8, 9, 35, 76 and 84. This is to our knowledge, the first report of an in vivo effect of single amino acid mismatches on HSCT outcomes. In this study, grouping of allelic mismatches into permissive and non-permissive categories and their association with transplantation end-points was relevant for TRM but not for other clinical end-points.","['Ludajic, Katarina', 'Balavarca, Yesilda', 'Bickeboller, Heike', 'Pohlreich, David', 'Kouba, Michal', 'Dobrovolna, Marie', 'Vrana, Milena', 'Rosenmayr, Agathe', 'Fischer, Gottfried F', 'Fae, Ingrid', 'Kalhs, Peter', 'Greinix, Hildegard T']","['Ludajic K', 'Balavarca Y', 'Bickeboller H', 'Pohlreich D', 'Kouba M', 'Dobrovolna M', 'Vrana M', 'Rosenmayr A', 'Fischer GF', 'Fae I', 'Kalhs P', 'Greinix HT']","['Division of Blood Group Serology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Amino Acids)', '0 (HLA-DP Antigens)', '0 (HLA-DP beta-Chains)', '0 (HLA-DPB1 antigen)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Alleles', 'Amino Acids/*genetics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Gene Frequency', 'Graft vs Host Disease', 'HLA-DP Antigens/*genetics/immunology', 'HLA-DP beta-Chains', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/mortality', 'Histocompatibility Testing/methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/immunology/mortality/*therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/immunology/mortality/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/immunology/mortality/therapy', 'Survival Rate', 'Young Adult']",2008/06/12 09:00,2009/05/20 09:00,['2008/06/12 09:00'],"['2008/06/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/20 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/12 09:00 [entrez]']","['BJH7177 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2008.07177.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2008 Jul;142(3):436-43. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2008.07177.x.

It is therefore important to develop and evaluate methods for identifying and studying tyrosine phosphorylated (P-Tyr) proteins. P-Tyr proteins are present at very low concentrations within cells, requiring highly selective enrichment methods to be detected. In this study, we applied immunoaffinity as enrichment step for P-Tyr proteins. Five selected anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (monoclonal antibodies 4G10, PY100, PYKD1, 13F9 and one polyclonal antiserum) were evaluated with respect to their capability to enrich P-Tyr proteins from cell extracts of the K562 leukemia cell line. The enrichment resulted in the detection of a group of proteins that potentially were tyrosine-phosphorylated (putative P-Tyr proteins). High accuracy identification of actual P-Tyr sites were performed using a highly selective and sensitive liquid chromatography Fourier transform mass spectrometer (LC-FTMS) setup with complementary collision activated dissociation (CAD) and electron capture dissociation (ECD) fragmentations. 4G10 and PY100 antibodies recognized the greatest number of putative P-Tyr proteins in initial screening experiments and were therefore further evaluated and compared in immunoaffinity enrichment of both P-Tyr proteins and peptides. Using the 4G10 antibody for enrichment of proteins, we identified 459 putative P-Tyr proteins by MS. Out of these proteins, 12 were directly verified as P-Tyr proteins by MS analysis of the actual site. Using the PY100 antibody for enrichment of peptides, we detected 67 P-Tyr peptides (sites) and 89 putative P-Tyr proteins. Generally, enrichment at the peptide level made it difficult to reliably determine the identity of the proteins. In contrast, protein identification following immunoaffinity enrichment at the protein level gave greater sequence coverage and thus a higher confidence in the protein identification. By combining all available information, 40 proteins were identified as true P-Tyr proteins from the K562 cell line. In conclusion, this study showed that a combination of immunoaffinity enrichment using multiple antibodies of both intact and digested proteins in parallel experiments is required for best possible coverage of all possible P-Tyr proteins in a sample.","['Bergstrom Lind, Sara', 'Molin, Magnus', 'Savitski, Mikhail M', 'Emilsson, Lina', 'Astrom, Jonas', 'Hedberg, Ludwig', 'Adams, Chris', 'Nielsen, Michael L', 'Engstrom, Ake', 'Elfineh, Lioudmila', 'Andersson, Eva', 'Zubarev, Roman A', 'Pettersson, Ulf']","['Bergstrom Lind S', 'Molin M', 'Savitski MM', 'Emilsson L', 'Astrom J', 'Hedberg L', 'Adams C', 'Nielsen ML', 'Engstrom A', 'Elfineh L', 'Andersson E', 'Zubarev RA', 'Pettersson U']","['Department of Genetics and Pathology, Rudbeck Laboratory, Uppsala University, SE-751 85 Uppsala, Sweden.

DESIGN: A descriptive cross-sectional study. SETTING: Paediatric Oncology Unit at Kenyatta National Hospital, Nairobi, Kenya. SUBJECTS: All paediatric oncology patients who had developed cytotoxic-induced neutropaenia. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The following were documented for every tissue proven case of malignancy; age, sex, type of malignancy, treatment regimen and schedule, initial blood count at the time of neutropaenia; subsequent blood counts daily for five days from day one of single dose filgastrim, and the calculated neutrophil incremental count. RESULTS: Initially eight patients with solid tumours previously treated with filgastrim revealed that cytotoxic induced neutropaenia could be ameliorated by a single dose of filgastrim. Subsequently, the study listed thirty patients. This cohort consisted of; 37% rhabdomyosarcoma, 30% Burkitts, 27% acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and 6% Hodgkin's lymphoma. Increased neutrophil count after 48 hours was documented in 26 (87%) patients, with absolute neutrophil counts range of 0.5 to 31.5 x 10(9)/L. This response was significantly influenced by gender (p>0.0001), malignancy type and chemotherapy regimen (p>0.001). CONCLUSION: The study shows that chemotherapy induced neutropaenia can be alleviated by a single dose of filgastrim without adverse effects on lymphoblastic leukaemia. This study suggests that a single dose of filgastrim should be first tried in cytotoxic induced neutropaenia in the paediatric age group.","['Abdallah, F K']",['Abdallah FK'],"['Department of Human Pathology, College of Health Sciences, University of Nairobi, Nairobi, Kenya.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],Kenya,East Afr Med J,East African medical journal,0372766,"['0 (Cytotoxins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'PVI5M0M1GW (Filgrastim)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Cytotoxins/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Filgrastim', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Health Status Indicators', 'Humans', 'Kenya/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Neutropenia/chemically induced/*drug therapy/epidemiology', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Retrospective Studies']",2008/06/12 09:00,2008/07/08 09:00,['2008/06/12 09:00'],"['2008/06/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/08 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/12 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.4314/eamj.v85i1.9603 [doi]'],ppublish,East Afr Med J. 2008 Jan;85(1):30-5. doi: 10.4314/eamj.v85i1.9603.,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: In the current study, the authors used a locus-specific indicator breakpoint cluster region/receptor tyrosine kinase (BCR/ABL) probe to evaluate the significance of del-der 9 in 163 patients with CML who had fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) results available. Serial changes in BCR/ABL fusion transcript levels also were monitored by using messenger RNA (mRNA) quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR). RESULTS: Of 163 patients, 22 (13.5%) had del-der 9 before commencing IM therapy. No differences were noted in the time to hematologic response (P = .598), major cytogenetic response (CyR) (P = .281), complete CyR (P = .883), major molecular response (MoR) (P = .125), or complete MoR (P = .834). In addition, the times to loss of response (LOR) (P = .974), treatment failure (P = .455; including primary hematologic or cytogenetic resistance and LOR), transformation-free survival (P = .276), and dose escalation of IM (P = .816) did not differ significantly between patients with and without del-der 9. The results of serial BCR/ABL mRNA quantitative PCR revealed similar patterns of BCR/ABL fusion gene reduction between the 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of del-der 9 in patients with CML did not influence 1) the response to IM therapy in terms of hematologic response, CyR, or MoR; 2) LOR; 3) treatment failure; 4) progression to accelerated phase/blast crisis; or 5) time to dose escalation of IM. Therefore, the authors concluded that the detection of del-der 9 does not have an impact on the current management of patients with CML who are receiving IM therapy.","['Kim, Dong Hwan Dennis', 'Popradi, Gizelle', 'Sriharsha, Lakshmi', 'Kamel-Reid, Suzanne', 'Chang, Hong', 'Messner, Hans A', 'Lipton, Jeffrey H']","['Kim DH', 'Popradi G', 'Sriharsha L', 'Kamel-Reid S', 'Chang H', 'Messner HA', 'Lipton JH']","['Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia Group, Department of Hematology/Medical Oncology, Princess Margaret Hospital, University Health Network, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada. drkiim@medmail.co.kr']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Benzamides', '*Chromosome Deletion', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperazines/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Failure', 'Treatment Outcome']",2008/06/11 09:00,2008/09/09 09:00,['2008/06/11 09:00'],"['2008/06/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/09 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/11 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.23607 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2008 Aug 15;113(4):772-81. doi: 10.1002/cncr.23607.,4,,,,,,,['2008 American Cancer Society'],,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Three pairs of primers and TaqMan probe were designed for detecting the most frequent PML/RAR alpha transcripts (L-form, S-form and V-form) and normal ABL was used as an internal control. A real time PCR condition was established to detect PML/RAR alpha and ABL positive templates with a series of dilutions. To evaluate this assay, bone marrow samples from 6 APL patients were detected. RESULTS: In repeated tests, maximal sensitivities of 10 copies/microL were obtained, while reproducible maximal sensitivity achieved 100 copies/microL. In 10 normal controls, no amplified fluorescent signals were detected. The median absolute and normalized amount of PML/RAR alpha fusion gene transcripts were 4.27 x 10(3)-3.36 x 10(5) copies/50 ng (median 4.33 x 10(4)copies/50 ng) and 29.38%-600.53% (median 48.12%) respectively. One case showed significant decrease of PML/RAR alpha fusion gene transcripts after induction therapy compared to that at the time of diagnosis, while the fusion transcripts significantly increased after relapsed. CONCLUSION: RQ-PCR is a sensitive, reliable quantitative assay and can be used in the diagnosis of APL and measurement of MRD.","['Lin, Jiang', 'Han, Lan-xiu', 'Qian, Jun', 'Wang, Ya-li', 'Qian, Zhen', 'Yang, Xiao-fei', 'Sheng, Xiao-jing']","['Lin J', 'Han LX', 'Qian J', 'Wang YL', 'Qian Z', 'Yang XF', 'Sheng XJ']","[""Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematolgy, Affiliated Peopleos Hospital, Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, 212002 People's Republic of China.""]",,['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Zhonghua Yi Xue Yi Chuan Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua yi xue yi chuan xue za zhi = Zhonghua yixue yichuanxue zazhi = Chinese journal of medical genetics,9425197,"['0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Young Adult']",2008/06/11 09:00,2009/03/20 09:00,['2008/06/11 09:00'],"['2008/06/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/03/20 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/11 09:00 [entrez]']",['940625071 [pii]'],ppublish,Zhonghua Yi Xue Yi Chuan Xue Za Zhi. 2008 Jun;25(3):319-21.,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated mechanisms of cobalt chloride induced apoptosis in HCT116 colorectal cancer cells. Cobalt chloride induced dose dependent apoptosis in HCT116 cells (250-750 muM) which, at higher concentrations (500-750 muM), was associated with an increase in the expression of the Bcl-2-related Mcl-1 survival protein. Cobalt chloride caused the accumulation of higher molecular weight ubiquitin-conjugates of Mcl-1 in intact HCT116 cells and inhibited the activity of the trypsin-like site of the 20S proteasome in an in vitro assay. Although siRNA-mediated knockdown of Mcl-1 increased apoptosis in HCT116 cells, the combination of Mcl-1 siRNA and cobalt chloride induced very high levels of cell killing. Therefore, inhibition of the proteasome by cobalt chloride leads to the accumulation of Mcl-1 which acts to limit cobalt chloride induced apoptosis.","['Lee, Melanie', 'Lapham, Abigail', 'Brimmell, Matthew', 'Wilkinson, Helen', 'Packham, Graham']","['Lee M', 'Lapham A', 'Brimmell M', 'Wilkinson H', 'Packham G']","['Cancer Research UK Clinical Centre, Cancer Sciences Division, University of Southampton School of Medicine, Southampton General Hospital, Southampton, SO16 6YD, UK.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Apoptosis,Apoptosis : an international journal on programmed cell death,9712129,"['0 (Antimutagenic Agents)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (HIF1A protein, human)', '0 (Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '3G0H8C9362 (Cobalt)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)', 'EVS87XF13W (cobaltous chloride)']",IM,"['Antimutagenic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/drug effects/metabolism', 'Binding Sites/drug effects/physiology', 'Carcinoma/drug therapy/*metabolism/physiopathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/physiology', 'Cobalt/*pharmacology', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/drug therapy/*metabolism/physiopathology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects/genetics', 'Feedback, Physiological/drug effects/genetics', 'Humans', 'Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit/genetics/metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/drug effects/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA Interference/physiology', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'Ubiquitination/drug effects/physiology']",2008/06/11 09:00,2008/09/18 09:00,['2008/06/11 09:00'],"['2008/06/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/18 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/11 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s10495-008-0229-2 [doi]'],ppublish,Apoptosis. 2008 Aug;13(8):972-82. doi: 10.1007/s10495-008-0229-2.,8,,,['Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In human cells, we demonstrate that Id genes are expressed in human acute myelogenous leukemia cells, and that knock down of Id1 expression inhibits leukemic cell line growth, suggesting that Id1 is required for leukemic cell proliferation. These findings established a causal relationship between Id1 overexpression and hematologic malignancy.

Therefore, it is important to recognize such cases. Monocytic differentiation is identified by morphology and confirmed by cytochemical stains or flow cytometry. However, the materials for such analyses are not always available (air-dried aspirate smears, touch preparations, fresh cells). Thus, the utility of CD163, a hemoglobin scavenger molecule present on monocytes/macrophages, in identifying a monocytic component in AML in fixed, paraffin-embedded bone marrows was assessed. Using tissue microarrays, 31 cases of AML with monocytic differentiation and 35 cases without monocytic differentiation were evaluated in a blinded fashion for CD163 positivity and compared with CD68. Diagnoses were previously well established using cytochemistry and flow cytometry techniques. CD163 immunoreactivity was seen in 49% of AML cases with and 6% (2/35) without monocytic differentiation. CD68 was positive in 81% of AML cases with and 17% without monocytic differentiation. CD163 showed superior specificity for a monocytic component in AML compared with CD68 (94% vs. 83%). However, the suboptimal sensitivity (49%) limits its utility as a definitive marker of monocytic differentiation if negative in paraffin sections. These findings demonstrate that CD163 is helpful for the evaluation of a monocytic component in AML. When positive, correlation and evaluation for an associated recurring cytogenetic abnormality is warranted.","['Garcia, Christine', 'Gardner, David', 'Reichard, Kaaren K']","['Garcia C', 'Gardner D', 'Reichard KK']","['Department of Pathology, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM 87131, USA.']",,['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Appl Immunohistochem Mol Morphol,Applied immunohistochemistry & molecular morphology : AIMM,100888796,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CD163 antigen)', '0 (CD68 antigen, human)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/*analysis/immunology', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/*analysis/immunology', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis/*immunology', 'Cell Differentiation/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*immunology/metabolism/*pathology', 'Monocytes/chemistry/*immunology/*pathology', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/*analysis/immunology', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",2008/06/11 09:00,2008/11/14 09:00,['2008/06/11 09:00'],"['2008/06/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/11/14 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/11 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/PAI.0b013e31815db477 [doi]'],ppublish,Appl Immunohistochem Mol Morphol. 2008 Oct;16(5):417-21. doi: 10.1097/PAI.0b013e31815db477.,5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Phase II studies have demonstrated efficacy and safety with dasatinib 70 mg twice daily in chronic-phase (CP) chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) after imatinib treatment failure. In phase I, responses occurred with once-daily administration despite only intermittent BCR-ABL inhibition. Once-daily treatment resulted in less toxicity, suggesting that toxicity results from continuous inhibition of unintended targets. Here, a dose- and schedule-optimization study is reported. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this open-label phase III trial, 670 patients with imatinib-resistant or -intolerant CP-CML were randomly assigned 1:1:1:1 between four dasatinib treatment groups: 100 mg once daily, 50 mg twice daily, 140 mg once daily, or 70 mg twice daily. RESULTS: With minimum follow-up of 6 months (median treatment duration, 8 months; range, < 1 to 15 months), marked and comparable hematologic (complete, 86% to 92%) and cytogenetic (major, 54% to 59%; complete, 41% to 45%) response rates were observed across the four groups. Time to and duration of cytogenetic response were similar, as was progression-free survival (8% to 11% of patients experienced disease progression or died). Compared with the approved 70-mg twice-daily regimen, dasatinib 100 mg once daily resulted in significantly lower rates of pleural effusion (all grades, 7% v 16%; P = .024) and grade 3 to 4 thrombocytopenia (22% v 37%; P = .004), and fewer patients required dose interruption (51% v 68%), reduction (30% v 55%), or discontinuation (16% v 23%). CONCLUSION: Dasatinib 100 mg once daily retains the efficacy of 70 mg twice daily with less toxicity. Intermittent target inhibition with tyrosine kinase inhibitors may preserve efficacy and reduce adverse events.","['Shah, Neil P', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M', 'Kim, Dong-Wook', 'Rea, Delphine', 'Dorlhiac-Llacer, Pedro E', 'Milone, Jorge H', 'Vela-Ojeda, Jorge', 'Silver, Richard T', 'Khoury, H Jean', 'Charbonnier, Aude', 'Khoroshko, Nina', 'Paquette, Ronald L', 'Deininger, Michael', 'Collins, Robert H', 'Otero, Irma', 'Hughes, Timothy', 'Bleickardt, Eric', 'Strauss, Lewis', 'Francis, Stephen', 'Hochhaus, Andreas']","['Shah NP', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Kim DW', 'Rea D', 'Dorlhiac-Llacer PE', 'Milone JH', 'Vela-Ojeda J', 'Silver RT', 'Khoury HJ', 'Charbonnier A', 'Khoroshko N', 'Paquette RL', 'Deininger M', 'Collins RH', 'Otero I', 'Hughes T', 'Bleickardt E', 'Strauss L', 'Francis S', 'Hochhaus A']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of California, San Francisco School of Medicine, Box 1270, 505 Parnassus Ave, San Francisco, CA 94143, USA. nshah@medicine.ucsf.edu']",,['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase III', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Benzamides', 'Dasatinib', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperazines/administration & dosage', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*administration & dosage', 'Pyrimidines/*administration & dosage', 'Survival Rate', 'Thiazoles/*administration & dosage', 'Treatment Outcome']",2008/06/11 09:00,2008/08/15 09:00,['2008/06/11 09:00'],"['2008/06/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/15 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/11 09:00 [entrez]']","['JCO.2007.14.9260 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2007.14.9260 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2008 Jul 1;26(19):3204-12. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2007.14.9260.

Recent measurements using mRNA-based assays have raised doubts, however, as to the importance of ASNS protein in the cellular mechanisms that confer drug resistance upon the leukemic cells. Studies aimed at determining the concentration of ASNS protein in human leukemias are therefore needed to resolve this issue. A mass spectrometry (MS)-based procedure is presented for the direct quantification of ASNS protein concentration in complex sample mixtures. This assay is able to distinguish samples from transformed cell lines that express ASNS over a wide dynamic range of concentration. Importantly, this method directly detects ASNS protein, the functional entity that may be synthesizing sufficient asparagine to render leukemia cells resistant to asparaginase-treatment. We also report the successful use of this MS method, which has lower limits of detection and quantification of 30 and 100 attomoles, respectively, for the first direct measurements of ASNS protein concentrations in four patient blast samples.","['Abbatiello, Susan E', 'Pan, Yuan-Xiang', 'Zhou, Mi', 'Wayne, Alan S', 'Veenstra, Timothy D', 'Hunger, Stephen P', 'Kilberg, Michael S', 'Eyler, John R', 'Richards, Nigel G J', 'Conrads, Thomas P']","['Abbatiello SE', 'Pan YX', 'Zhou M', 'Wayne AS', 'Veenstra TD', 'Hunger SP', 'Kilberg MS', 'Eyler JR', 'Richards NG', 'Conrads TP']","['Department of Pharmacology, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",Netherlands,J Proteomics,Journal of proteomics,101475056,['EC 6.3.1.1 (Aspartate-Ammonia Ligase)'],IM,"['Aspartate-Ammonia Ligase/*metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'K562 Cells', 'Lymphocytes/enzymology/pathology', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*enzymology/*pathology']",2008/06/11 09:00,2008/08/01 09:00,['2008/06/11 09:00'],"['2007/09/17 00:00 [received]', '2007/10/26 00:00 [revised]', '2007/11/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/06/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/01 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/11 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1874-3919(07)00251-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jprot.2007.11.009 [doi]']",ppublish,J Proteomics. 2008 Apr 30;71(1):61-70. doi: 10.1016/j.jprot.2007.11.009.

Recently, allogeneic-hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) has been suggested to improve the outcome. We retrospectively analyzed 15 patients with ATL who had received allo-HSCT in 2 institutions in Hokkaido, Japan. The median age of the patients was 57 years. The estimated 3-year overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) rates were 73.3% and 66.7%, respectively. Calcineurin inhibitor dosage was reduced and administration was discontinued abruptly in 6 of the 15 patients for disease control; as a result, 4 (66.7%) of the 6 patients achieved complete response (CR) or partial response. Therefore, a graft-versus-leukemia/lymphoma (GVL) effect might be induced by discontinuation of immunosuppression. Thirteen of the 15 patients were followed up by monitoring HTLV-1 proviral DNA levels. In 10 of the 11 patients with positive HTLV-1 proviral DNA before allo-HSCT, HTLV-1 proviral DNA became undetectable at least once after allo-HSCT, and only 1 of the 5 patients in whom HTLV-1 proviral DNA became detectable after allo-HSCT relapsed. Compared to the results of past studies, these results show that allo-HSCT greatly improved the prognosis of ATL and suggest a contribution of the induction of a GVL effect.","['Shiratori, Souichi', 'Yasumoto, Atsushi', 'Tanaka, Junji', 'Shigematsu, Akio', 'Yamamoto, Satoshi', 'Nishio, Mitsufumi', 'Hashino, Satoshi', 'Morita, Rena', 'Takahata, Mutsumi', 'Onozawa, Masahiro', 'Kahata, Kaoru', 'Kondo, Takeshi', 'Ota, Shuichi', 'Wakasa, Kentaro', 'Sugita, Junichi', 'Koike, Takao', 'Asaka, Masahiro', 'Kasai, Masaharu', 'Imamura, Masahiro']","['Shiratori S', 'Yasumoto A', 'Tanaka J', 'Shigematsu A', 'Yamamoto S', 'Nishio M', 'Hashino S', 'Morita R', 'Takahata M', 'Onozawa M', 'Kahata K', 'Kondo T', 'Ota S', 'Wakasa K', 'Sugita J', 'Koike T', 'Asaka M', 'Kasai M', 'Imamura M']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Hokkaido University Graduate School of Medicine, West 7 chome North 15 jo, North Ward, Sapporo, Japan.

There is no uniform standard therapy for PTCL, and autologous hematopoietic cell transplant (AHCT) is often offered as consolidation in first remission or at relapse because of the poor outcomes with conventional therapy. We conducted a retrospective review of patients who underwent AHCT for PTCL from 1989 to 2006. Fifty-three cases were identified consisting of systemic anaplastic large cell (n = 18), PTCL unspecified (n = 17), angioimmunoblastic (n = 9), nasal type extranodal NK/T (n = 7), hepatosplenic (n = 2), and adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma (n = 1). Fifteen patients were transplanted in first complete or partial response (CR1/PR1), 32 in second or beyond CR or PR (CR2/PR2+), and 11 with primary refractory disease (REF). With a median follow-up was 5 years (range: 1.0-11.5), the 5-year progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 25% and 48%, respectively. Disease status at AHCT had a significant impact on PFS and OS. The 5-year PFS for patients in CR1/PR1, CR2/PR2+, and REF was 51%, 12%, and 0%, respectively, and the corresponding figures for OS were 76%, 40%, and 30%, respectively. The pretransplant factors that impacted survival were disease status and the number of prior regimens. Histology, age, sex, stage, B symptoms, bone marrow involvement, and duration of first response did not significantly affect PFS or OS. Based on these results, AHCT as consolidation therapy in first complete or partial response may offer a durable survival benefit. However, AHCT with conventional salvage chemotherapy has minimal durable benefit in patients with relapsed or refractory PTCL, and thus novel strategies and/or allogeneic HCT should be more aggressively explored in lieu of AHCT for relapsed/ refractory PTCL.","['Chen, Andy I', 'McMillan, Alex', 'Negrin, Robert S', 'Horning, Sandra J', 'Laport, Ginna G']","['Chen AI', 'McMillan A', 'Negrin RS', 'Horning SJ', 'Laport GG']","['Stanford University Medical Center, Division of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Stanford, California 94305, USA. aichen@stanford.edu']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Hospitals, University', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Lymphocyte Depletion', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell, Peripheral/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*therapy', 'Remission Induction/methods', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",2008/06/11 09:00,2008/08/05 09:00,['2008/06/11 09:00'],"['2008/01/25 00:00 [received]', '2008/04/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/06/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/05 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/11 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1083-8791(08)00146-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbmt.2008.04.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2008 Jul;14(7):741-7. doi: 10.1016/j.bbmt.2008.04.004.,7,,,"['P01 CA049605/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA049605-15/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC2980839,['NIHMS232367'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

The HTLV-1 Tax protein plays an important role in the transformation of T-cells although the exact mechanisms remain unclear. Parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) plays an important role in the pathogenesis of humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy (HHM) that occurs in the majority of ATLL patients. However, PTHrP is also up-regulated in HTLV-1-carriers and HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP) patients without hypercalcemia, indicating that PTHrP is expressed before transformation of T-cells. The expression of PTHrP and the PTH/PTHrP receptor during immortalization or transformation of lymphocytes by HTLV-1 has not been investigated. RESULTS: We report that PTHrP was up-regulated during immortalization of lymphocytes from peripheral blood mononuclear cells by HTLV-1 infection in long-term co-culture assays. There was preferential utilization of the PTHrP-P2 promoter in the immortalized cells compared to the HTLV-1-transformed MT-2 cells. PTHrP expression did not correlate temporally with expression of HTLV-1 tax. HTLV-1 infection up-regulated the PTHrP receptor (PTH1R) in lymphocytes indicating a potential autocrine role for PTHrP. Furthermore, co-transfection of HTLV-1 expression plasmids and PTHrP P2/P3-promoter luciferase reporter plasmids demonstrated that HTLV-1 up-regulated PTHrP expression only mildly, indicating that other cellular factors and/or events are required for the very high PTHrP expression observed in ATLL cells. We also report that macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha (MIP-1alpha), a cellular gene known to play an important role in the pathogenesis of HHM in ATLL patients, was highly expressed during early HTLV-1 infection indicating that, unlike PTHrP, its expression was enhanced due to activation of lymphocytes by HTLV-1 infection. CONCLUSION: These data demonstrate that PTHrP and its receptor are up-regulated specifically during immortalization of T-lymphocytes by HTLV-1 infection and may facilitate the transformation process.","['Nadella, Murali V P', 'Shu, Sherry T', 'Dirksen, Wessel P', 'Thudi, Nanda K', 'Nadella, Kiran S', 'Fernandez, Soledad A', 'Lairmore, Michael D', 'Green, Patrick L', 'Rosol, Thomas J']","['Nadella MV', 'Shu ST', 'Dirksen WP', 'Thudi NK', 'Nadella KS', 'Fernandez SA', 'Lairmore MD', 'Green PL', 'Rosol TJ']","['Department of Veterinary Biosciences, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.

Data correlating the form of liver involvement with distinct lymphoma subtypes is, however, scarce. The aim was to review 89 liver biopsies diagnosed with lymphoma infiltration and evaluate the infiltration patterns. METHODS AND RESULTS: In equivocal cases, additional immunohistochemical and molecular pathology analyses were performed to differentiate between neoplastic and reactive cell infiltrates and to classify the lymphoma subtypes. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) and Burkitt lymphoma (BL) were the most prevalent subtypes in our series, which included 14 different lymphoma entities in total. Whereas DLBCL and BL predominantly demonstrated tumour nodules deranging the normal hepatic architecture, CLL and HL mostly showed infiltration of the portal fields. Interestingly, distinct lymphoma entities, particularly marginal zone B-cell lymphomas (MZL) and HL, commonly revealed lympho-epithelial lesions of bile ducts, which were observed in 10% of all investigated cases. Four cases, initially interpreted as T-cell lymphomas, proved to be reactive T-cell lesions. CONCLUSIONS: Distinct lymphoma subtypes show characteristic patterns of liver infiltration. Additional molecular analyses can support diagnosis by verification of clonality or detection of characteristic genetic aberrations.","['Baumhoer, D', 'Tzankov, A', 'Dirnhofer, S', 'Tornillo, L', 'Terracciano, L M']","['Baumhoer D', 'Tzankov A', 'Dirnhofer S', 'Tornillo L', 'Terracciano LM']","['Institute of Pathology, University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland. dbaumhoer@mac.com']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Histopathology,Histopathology,7704136,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biopsy', 'Child', 'Clone Cells', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Female', 'Gene Rearrangement, gamma-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor/genetics', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Liver Neoplasms/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Lymphoma/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies']",2008/06/11 09:00,2008/09/19 09:00,['2008/06/11 09:00'],"['2008/06/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/19 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/11 09:00 [entrez]']","['HIS3069 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2559.2008.03069.x [doi]']",ppublish,Histopathology. 2008 Jul;53(1):81-90. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2559.2008.03069.x.

We determined that a hairy-cell leukaemia line, MLMA, expressed a relatively high level of BAFF-R and was susceptible to apoptosis mediated by either CD20 or B-cell antigen receptor (BCR). Using MLMA cells as an in vitro model of mature B cells, we found that treatment with BAFF could inhibit apoptosis mediated by both CD20 and BCR. We also observed, using immunoblot analysis and microarray analysis, that BAFF treatment induced activation of nuclear factor-kappaB2 following elevation of the expression level of Bcl-2, which may be involved in the molecular mechanism of BAFF-mediated inhibition of apoptosis. Interestingly, BAFF treatment was also found to induce the expression of a series of genes, such as that for CD40, related to cell survival, suggesting the involvement of a multiple mechanism in the BAFF-mediated anti-apoptotic effect. MLMA cells should provide a model for investigating the molecular basis of the effect of BAFF on B cells in vitro and will help to elucidate how B cells survive in the immune system in which BAFF-mediated signalling is involved.","['Saito, Yohei', 'Miyagawa, Yoshitaka', 'Onda, Keiko', 'Nakajima, Hideki', 'Sato, Ban', 'Horiuchi, Yasuomi', 'Okita, Hajime', 'Katagiri, Yohko U', 'Saito, Masahiro', 'Shimizu, Toshiaki', 'Fujimoto, Junichiro', 'Kiyokawa, Nobutaka']","['Saito Y', 'Miyagawa Y', 'Onda K', 'Nakajima H', 'Sato B', 'Horiuchi Y', 'Okita H', 'Katagiri YU', 'Saito M', 'Shimizu T', 'Fujimoto J', 'Kiyokawa N']","['Department of Developmental Biology, National Research Institute for Child Health and Development, Setagaya-ku, Tokyo, Japan.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Immunology,Immunology,0374672,"['0 (Antigens, CD20)', '0 (B-Cell Activating Factor)', '0 (CD40 Antigens)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD20/*immunology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics', 'B-Cell Activating Factor/*pharmacology', 'B-Lymphocytes/cytology', 'CD40 Antigens/analysis/genetics', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Depression, Chemical', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/*immunology', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Up-Regulation']",2008/06/11 09:00,2009/02/21 09:00,['2008/06/11 09:00'],"['2008/06/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/02/21 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/11 09:00 [entrez]']","['IMM2872 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2567.2008.02872.x [doi]']",ppublish,Immunology. 2008 Dec;125(4):570-90. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2567.2008.02872.x.

These engraftment difficulties may be due to the unique nature of MDS genetic lesions that are truly able to recapitulate the disease phenotype. MDS and AML of younger patients harbour clonal yet different chromosomal markers, whereas MDS and AML of the elderly present similar defects. Potential involvement of tumor suppressor genes in MDS has been hypothesized but never confirmed, while cooperation between class I and class II mutations has been identified in AML.

CASE: A 25-year-old patient with a past history of treated large granular lymphocytic leukemia and presence of a predominant population of large, atypical lymphoid cells in the CSF, giving us the impression of involvement with large cell lymphoma. However, a timely call to the hematologist revealed that the serology was positive for acute Epstein-Barr virus infection. Flow cytometry of CSF confirmed polyclonal population of B-cells and T-cells.

CML was the first cancer to be associated with a defined genetic abnormality, BCR-ABL, that is necessary and sufficient for initiating chronic phase disease as well as the first cancer to be treated with molecular targeted therapy. Malignant progenitors or leukemia stem cells (LSCs) evolve as a result of both epigenetic and genetic events that alter hematopoietic progenitor differentiation, proliferation, survival, and self-renewal. LSCs are rare and divide less frequently, and thus, represent a reservoir for relapse and resistance to a molecularly targeted single agent. On subverting developmental processes normally responsible for maintaining robust life-long hematopoiesis, the LSCs are able to evade the majority of current cancer treatments that target rapidly dividing cells. Enthusiasm for the enormous success of tyrosine kinase inhibitors at controlling the chronic phase disease is tempered somewhat by the persistence of the LSC pool in the majority of the patients. Combined therapies targeting aberrant properties of LSC may obviate therapeutic resistance and relapse in advanced phase and therapeutically recalcitrant CML.","['Kavalerchik, Edward', 'Goff, Daniel', 'Jamieson, Catriona H M']","['Kavalerchik E', 'Goff D', 'Jamieson CH']","['Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Moores Cancer Center, 3855 Health Science Rd, University of California -San Diego, CA 92093-0820, USA. ekavalerchik@ucsd.edu']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects/enzymology/metabolism/*pathology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Secondary Prevention']",2008/06/10 09:00,2008/06/21 09:00,['2008/06/10 09:00'],"['2008/06/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/21 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['26/17/2911 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2008.17.5745 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2008 Jun 10;26(17):2911-5. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2008.17.5745.,17,67,,,,,,,,,['J Clin Oncol. 2009 Jan 10;27(2):313-4.

Bortezomib, a proteasome inhibitor, has shown impressive efficacy as a single agent in patients with hematologic malignancies but can result in toxicity when administered late after allogeneic transplantation in murine models of GVHD. In the current study, the effects of T-cell subsets and their associated cytokines on the efficacy of bortezomib in murine allogeneic BMT were investigated. Increased levels of serum tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha) and interferon-gamma (IFNgamma) were observed after allo-BMT and continuous bortezomib administration. Bortezomib-induced GVHD-dependent mortality was preventable by depletion of CD4(+) but not CD8(+) T cells from the donor graft. The improved survival correlated with markedly reduced serum TNFalpha but not IFNgamma levels. Transfer of Tnf(-/-) T cells also protected recipients from bortezomib-induced GVHD-dependent toxicity. Importantly, prolonged administration of bortezomib after transplantation of purified CD8(+) T cells resulted in enhanced GVT response, which was dependent on donor CD8(+) T cell-derived IFNgamma. These results indicate that decreased toxicity and increased efficacy of bortezomib in murine allo-BMT can be achieved by removal of CD4(+) T cells from the graft or by inhibiting TNFalpha.","['Sun, Kai', 'Li, Minghui', 'Sayers, Thomas J', 'Welniak, Lisbeth A', 'Murphy, William J']","['Sun K', 'Li M', 'Sayers TJ', 'Welniak LA', 'Murphy WJ']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Nevada, School of Medicine, Reno, NV 89557, USA.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Boronic Acids)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects/*methods', 'Boronic Acids/*administration & dosage', 'Bortezomib', 'Cytokines/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect', 'Graft vs Tumor Effect', 'Interferon-gamma', 'Lymphocyte Depletion', 'Mice', 'Pyrazines/*administration & dosage', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/metabolism/*transplantation', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/metabolism']",2008/06/10 09:00,2008/09/17 09:00,['2008/06/10 09:00'],"['2008/06/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)49744-7 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2008-03-143461 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2008 Aug 15;112(4):1522-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2008-03-143461.

We analyzed SM development and pathogenesis in a murine CEL model induced by F/P in hematopoietic stem cells and progenitors (HSCs/Ps) and T-cell overexpression of IL-5 (F/P-positive CEL mice). These mice had more mast cell (MC) infiltration in the bone marrow (BM), spleen, skin, and small intestine than control mice that received a transplant of IL-5 transgenic HSCs/Ps. Moreover, intestinal MC infiltration induced by F/P expression was severely diminished, but not abolished, in mice injected with neutralizing anti-c-kit antibody, suggesting that endogenous stem cell factor (SCF)/c-kit interaction synergizes with F/P expression to induce SM. F/P-expressing BM HSCs/Ps showed proliferation and MC differentiation in vitro in the absence of cytokines. SCF stimulated greater migration of F/P-expressing MCs than mock vector-transduced MCs. F/P-expressing bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMCs) survived longer than mock vector control BMMCs in cytokine-deprived conditions. The increased proliferation and survival correlated with increased SCF-induced Akt activation. In summary, F/P synergistically promotes MC development, activation, and survival in vivo and in vitro in response to SCF.","['Yamada, Yoshiyuki', 'Sanchez-Aguilera, Abel', 'Brandt, Eric B', 'McBride, Melissa', 'Al-Moamen, Nabeel J H', 'Finkelman, Fred D', 'Williams, David A', 'Cancelas, Jose A', 'Rothenberg, Marc E']","['Yamada Y', 'Sanchez-Aguilera A', 'Brandt EB', 'McBride M', 'Al-Moamen NJ', 'Finkelman FD', 'Williams DA', 'Cancelas JA', 'Rothenberg ME']","[""Division of Allergy and Immunology, Department of Pediatrics, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, OH 45229-3039, USA.""]",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (FIP1L1 protein, human)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '0 (mRNA Cleavage and Polyadenylation Factors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor alpha)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Movement', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Hypereosinophilic Syndrome/*etiology', 'Mastocytosis, Systemic/chemically induced/*etiology/pathology', 'Mice', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor alpha/*therapeutic use', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/*adverse effects', 'Stem Cell Factor/*physiology', 'mRNA Cleavage and Polyadenylation Factors/*therapeutic use']",2008/06/10 09:00,2008/10/31 09:00,['2008/06/10 09:00'],"['2008/06/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/31 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)59873-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2007-11-126268 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2008 Sep 15;112(6):2500-7. doi: 10.1182/blood-2007-11-126268.

The aim of this study was to differentiate the regulation of genes in the endometrium of patients with recurrent implantation failure (IF) versus those who became pregnant after in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment. Moreover, the effect of embryo-derived factors on endometrial transcriptional activity was studied. Nine women with known IVF outcome (IF, M, miscarriage, OP, ongoing pregnancy) and undergoing hysteroscopy with endometrial biopsy were enrolled. Biopsies were taken during the midluteal phase. After culture in the presence of embryo-conditioned IVF media, total RNA was extracted and submitted to reverse transcription, target cDNA synthesis, biotin labelling, fragmentation and hybridization using the Affymetrix Human Genome U133A 2.0 Chip. Differential expression of selected genes was re-analysed by quantitative PCR, in which the results were calculated as threshold cycle differences between the groups and normalized to Glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase and beta-actin. Differences were seen for several genes from endometrial tissue between the IF and the pregnancy groups, and when comparing OP with M, 1875 up- and 1807 down-regulated genes were returned. Real-time PCR analysis confirmed up-regulation for somatostatin, PLAP-2, mucin 4 and CD163, and down-regulation of glycodelin, IL-24, CD69, leukaemia inhibitory factor and prolactin receptor between Op and M. When the different embryo-conditioned media were compared, no significant differential regulation could be demonstrated. Although microarray profiling may currently not be sensitive enough for studying the effects of embryo-derived factors on the endometrium, the observed differences in gene expression between M and OP suggest that it will become an interesting tool for the identification of fertility-relevant markers produced by the endometrium.","['Bersinger, Nick A', 'Wunder, Dorothea M', 'Birkhauser, Martin H', 'Mueller, Michael D']","['Bersinger NA', 'Wunder DM', 'Birkhauser MH', 'Mueller MD']","['Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Inselspital, Berne University Hospital, University of Berne, Murtenstrasse 35, Berne CH-3010, Switzerland. nick.bersinger@dkf.unibe.ch']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Mol Hum Reprod,Molecular human reproduction,9513710,,IM,"['Embryo Implantation/genetics', 'Endometrium/*metabolism', 'Female', '*Fertilization in Vitro', 'Gene Expression Profiling/*methods', 'Humans', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tissue Culture Techniques']",2008/06/10 09:00,2009/01/20 09:00,['2008/06/10 09:00'],"['2008/06/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/20 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['gan036 [pii]', '10.1093/molehr/gan036 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Hum Reprod. 2008 Aug;14(8):475-84. doi: 10.1093/molehr/gan036.

Cytosine arabinoside, vincristine, daunorubicin, and doxorubicin are common drugs for hematological cancer therapy, and they may have some effects on bone marrow stroma during chemotherapy. The aim of this study was to elucidate interactions between the bone marrow stromal microenvironment and leukemic cells after drug treatment. We tested the hypothesis that human HS-5 stromal cells, pretreated with anticancer drugs, affected the growth of leukemic K562 cells by changing the cytokines in the culture microenvironment. Thereafter, proliferation of K562 cells increased nearly 2.5-fold compared the co-cultivation with drugs-pretreated HS-5 stromal cells and drugs-untreated HS-5 stromal cells. The results indicated that co-cultivation with HS-5 stromal cells pretreated with drugs caused significant K562 cell proliferation. Cytokines in the microenvironment were detected via the RayBio((R))Human Cytokine Antibody Array Membrane. The levels of the cytokines CKbeta, IL-12, IL-13, IGFBP-2, MCP-1, MCP-3, MCP-4, MDC, MIP-1beta and MIP-1delta were decreased, with a particularly marked decrease in MIP-3alpha. In co-culture medium, there was a 20-fold decrease in MIP-3alpha in daunorubicin-pretreated HS-5 cells and at least a 3-fold decrease in Ara-C-pretreated cells. This indicated a significant effect of anticancer drugs on the stromal cell line. Using phosphorylated Erk and pRb proteins as cell proliferation markers, we found that phosphorylation of these markers in K562 cells was inhibited during co-cultivation with drug-pretreated stromal cells in MIP-3alpha-supplemented medium and restored by MIP-3alpha antibody supplement. In conclusion, anticancer drug pretreatment suppresses the negative control exerted by HS-5 cells on leukemic cell proliferation, via modulation of cytokines in the microenvironment, especially at the level of MIP-3alpha.","['Lee, Ying Chu', 'Chiou, Tzeon-Jye', 'Tzeng, Woan-Fang', 'Chu, Sin Tak']","['Lee YC', 'Chiou TJ', 'Tzeng WF', 'Chu ST']","['Institute of Biological Chemistry, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Ireland,Toxicology,Toxicology,0361055,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Chemokine CCL20)', '0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Tetrazolium Salts)', '0 (Thiazoles)', 'EUY85H477I (thiazolyl blue)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Cell Survival', 'Chemokine CCL20/*pharmacology', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Culture Media, Conditioned', 'Cytokines/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Stromal Cells/*drug effects', 'Tetrazolium Salts', 'Thiazoles']",2008/06/10 09:00,2008/09/04 09:00,['2008/06/10 09:00'],"['2008/03/28 00:00 [received]', '2008/04/15 00:00 [revised]', '2008/04/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/06/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/04 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0300-483X(08)00178-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.tox.2008.04.017 [doi]']",ppublish,Toxicology. 2008 Jul 30;249(2-3):116-22. doi: 10.1016/j.tox.2008.04.017.

These findings may have broad implications for mechanisms underlying malignant transformation in hematopoietic and other malignancies.","['Faber, Jorg', 'Gregory, Richard I', 'Armstrong, Scott A']","['Faber J', 'Gregory RI', 'Armstrong SA']","[""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Children's Hospital Boston, Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.""]",,['eng'],"['Comment', 'Journal Article']",United States,Cancer Cell,Cancer cell,101130617,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (abl-bcr fusion protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', '*DNA Methylation', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', '*Gene Silencing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/drug therapy/enzymology/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'MicroRNAs/genetics/*metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl/*metabolism', 'Up-Regulation']",2008/06/10 09:00,2008/06/20 09:00,['2008/06/10 09:00'],"['2008/06/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1535-6108(08)00163-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ccr.2008.05.013 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Cell. 2008 Jun;13(6):467-9. doi: 10.1016/j.ccr.2008.05.013.,6,,['Cancer Cell. 2008 Jun;13(6):496-506.

Functional studies were performed using the Mo7e and Mo7e-p210 cell lines. Expression of CCND1 (Cyclin D1), as well as the chaperone HSPA8, which is important for regulation of CCND1, were significantly upregulated in CD34+ CML cells. Upregulation of HSPA8 was dependent, at least in part, on STAT5 (signal transducer and activator of transcrition 5)-dependent transcriptional activation, as demonstrated by chromatin immunoprecipitation. The presence of HSPA8 in the nuclear protein fraction as well as its binding to CCND1 suggests that it may contribute to stabilization of the CCND1/CDK4 complex, which, in turn, may participate in proliferation of CML cells. Treatment of CML cells with the specific HSPA8 inhibitor 15-deoxyspergualin induced inhibition of CML cell viability but did not induce apoptosis. In conclusion, our studies suggest that STAT5-mediated activation of HSPA8 induces nuclear translocation and activation of the CCND1/CDK4 complex leading to increased proliferation of CML cells, deciphering a new pathway implicated in CML and supporting a potential role of chaperone inhibitors in the treatment of CML.","['Jose-Eneriz, Edurne San', 'Roman-Gomez, Jose', 'Cordeu, Lucia', 'Ballestar, Esteban', 'Garate, Leire', 'Andreu, Enrique J', 'Isidro, Isabel', 'Guruceaga, Elizabeth', 'Jimenez-Velasco, Antonio', 'Heiniger, Anabel', 'Torres, Antonio', 'Calasanz, Maria Jose', 'Esteller, Manel', 'Gutierrez, Norma C', 'Rubio, Angel', 'Perez-Roger, Ignacio', 'Agirre, Xabier', 'Prosper, Felipe']","['Jose-Eneriz ES', 'Roman-Gomez J', 'Cordeu L', 'Ballestar E', 'Garate L', 'Andreu EJ', 'Isidro I', 'Guruceaga E', 'Jimenez-Velasco A', 'Heiniger A', 'Torres A', 'Calasanz MJ', 'Esteller M', 'Gutierrez NC', 'Rubio A', 'Perez-Roger I', 'Agirre X', 'Prosper F']","['Foundation for Applied Medical Research, Division of Cancer, Area of Cell Therapy and Haematology Service, Clinica Universitaria, Universidad de Navarra, Spain.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Cyclin D)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (HSC70 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (HSPA8 protein, human)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor/metabolism', 'Cell Survival', 'Cyclin D', 'Cyclins/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'HSC70 Heat-Shock Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/*metabolism', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Signal Transduction']",2008/06/10 09:00,2008/12/17 09:00,['2008/06/10 09:00'],"['2008/06/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['BJH7221 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2008.07221.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2008 Aug;142(4):571-82. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2008.07221.x.

Secreted Frizzled-related protein genes (SFRPs), functioning as Wnt signalling antagonists, have been found to be downregulated by promoter hypermethylation in many tumours. To analyse epigenetic dysregulation of SFRPs in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), we examined the promoter methylation status of SFRP1, -2, -4 and -5 in AML cell lines by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (MSP). Aberrant CpG island methylation was found for all four SFRP genes. By real-time reverse transcription-PCR, corresponding transcriptional silencing for SFRP1 and -2 was demonstrated and treatment of cell lines with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine resulted in re-expression. The methylation status of the SFRP genes was analysed in 100 specimens obtained from AML patients at diagnosis. The frequencies of aberrant methylation among the patient samples were 29% for SFRP1, 19% for SFRP2, 0% for SFRP4 and 9% for SFRP5. For SFRP2, a correlation between promoter hypermethylation and transcriptional downregulation was found in primary AML samples. Among AML cases with a favourable karyotype, hypermethylation of SFRP genes was restricted to patients with core binding factor (CBF) leukaemia, and aberrant methylation of the SFRP2 promoter was an adverse risk factor for survival in CBF leukaemia.","['Jost, E', 'Schmid, J', 'Wilop, S', 'Schubert, C', 'Suzuki, H', 'Herman, J G', 'Osieka, R', 'Galm, O']","['Jost E', 'Schmid J', 'Wilop S', 'Schubert C', 'Suzuki H', 'Herman JG', 'Osieka R', 'Galm O']","['Medizinische Klinik IV, Universitaetsklinikum Aachen, RWTH Aachen, Aachen, Germany. ejost@ukaachen.de']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Eye Proteins)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (SFRP1 protein, human)', '0 (SFRP2 protein, human)', '0 (SFRP4 protein, human)', '0 (SFRP5 protein, human)', '0 (Wnt Proteins)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Case-Control Studies', 'CpG Islands', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Eye Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Membrane Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Methylation', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Signal Transduction', 'Wnt Proteins/*genetics']",2008/06/10 09:00,2008/12/17 09:00,['2008/06/10 09:00'],"['2008/06/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['BJH7242 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2008.07242.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2008 Sep;142(5):745-53. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2008.07242.x.

Three of them: clofarabine (CAFdA), nelarabine, and forodesine (immucillin H, BCX-1777), despite belonging to the same group of drugs such as PNA, have shown some differences concerning their active forms, metabolic properties and mechanism of action. However, all these drugs have demonstrated promising activity in patients with relapsed and refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). CAFdA was approved for the therapy of relapsed or refractory ALL in the third line of treatment. It has proved promising in pediatric patients as well as in some patients who are able to proceed to allogenic hematopietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Moreover, the drug exhibits an efficacy in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), blast crisis of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML-BP) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Nelarabine is recommended for T-ALL and T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-LBL) with the overall response rates ranging from 11 to 60%. However, the use of the drug is limited by potentially severe neurotoxicity.

Over the past decade, interest in GSK-3beta has grown far beyond glycogen metabolism, and this is due in large measure to the critical role that GSK-3beta plays in the regulation of many other cellular processes, particularly cell proliferation and apoptosis. GSK-3beta has been shown to regulate the proteolysis and sub-cellular compartmentalization of a number of proteins directly involved in the regulation of cell cycling, proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. GSK-3beta also regulates the degradation of proteins that regulate gene expression and thus affects a variety of important cell functions. Specifically, GSK-3beta controls the degradation of beta-catenin, the main effector of Wnt that regulates haematopoiesis and stem cell function. In this case GSK-3beta is a negative regulator of Wnt. In contrast, GSK-3beta positively regulates NF-kappaB, another important biochemical pathway also involved in the regulation of multiple aspects of normal and aberrant haematopoiesis. GSK-3beta regulates degradation of IkappaB, a central inhibitor of NF-kappaB. In this way, GSK-3beta acts to control the resistance of leukaemic cells to chemotherapy through the modulation of NF-kappaB, a critical factor in maintaining leukaemic cell growth. In addition, GSK-3beta regulates the pro-inflammatory activity of NF-kappaB. As GSK-3beta is a pleiotropic regulator, inhibitors may increase the range of novel anti-leukaemic and anti-inflammatory drugs that control immune response.","['Holmes, T', ""O'Brien, T A"", 'Knight, R', 'Lindeman, R', 'Symonds, G', 'Dolnikov, A']","['Holmes T', ""O'Brien TA"", 'Knight R', 'Lindeman R', 'Symonds G', 'Dolnikov A']","[""Sydney Children's Hospital, University of New South Wales, Australia.""]",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United Arab Emirates,Curr Med Chem,Current medicinal chemistry,9440157,"['0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Wnt Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.26 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/enzymology/immunology/*metabolism', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic/enzymology/immunology/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Wnt Proteins/metabolism']",2008/06/10 09:00,2008/09/04 09:00,['2008/06/10 09:00'],"['2008/06/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/04 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/10 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.2174/092986708784638834 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Med Chem. 2008;15(15):1493-9. doi: 10.2174/092986708784638834.,15,87,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The growing knowledge of key cellular pathways in tumor induction and progression, targeted therapies represent an increasing proportion of new drugs entering clinical trials. Some molecules such as trastuzumab, rituximab, alemtuzumab, cetuximab are now widely used in clinical practice. These antibodies are now tested in different indications alone or in combination with standard chemotherapy. They are also developed for the treatment of inflammatory diseases (rituximab). Numerous others antibodies are currently in pre-clinical and clinical development phases for several malignancies including renal carcinoma, melanoma, lymphomas, leukaemia, breast, ovarian and colorectal cancer. An alternative approach is to conjugate the monoclonal antibody to a toxin, a cytotoxic agent, or a radioisotope. In other cases these antibodies aim to modify the tumour microenvironment through inhibition of angiogenesis or enhancing host immune response against cancer. If the molecule targeted by the antibodies is clearly identified, most often the precise mechanism of action of these immunoglobulins is not fully understood. They can have direct effects in inducing apoptosis or programmed cell death. They can block growth factor receptors, efficiently arresting proliferation of tumor cells. Indirect effects include recruiting cells that exert cytotoxicity, such as monocytes and macrophages (ADCC). Monoclonal antibodies also bind complement, leading to toxicity known as complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC). The side effects associated with these new treatments were in part foreseeable depending on the affected cell or function. But new or surprising side effects emerged from clinical studies. We present an overview of the monoclonal antibodies used in clinical oncology or currently in development phases.

METHODS: Fifty-nine patients with T1 lesions were treated with local excision alone, whereas 51 patients with T2 lesions received external beam irradiation (5,400 cGY) and 5-fluorouracil (500 mg/m(2) intravenously Days 1-3, Days 29-31) after local excision. Kaplan-Meier curves were used to estimate the primary outcomes. The log-rank test and Cox's proportional hazards model were used to compare subgroups relative to these outcomes. RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 7.1 (range, 2.1-11.4) years, ten-year rates of overall survival were 84 percent for patients with T1 and 66 percent for T2 rectal cancer. Disease-free survival was 75 percent for T1 and 64 percent for T2 disease. Local recurrence rates for patients with T1 and T2 lesions were 8 and 18 percent, respectively, and rates of distant metastases were 5 percent for T1 and 12 percent for T2 lesions. T stage was a statistically significant predictor of overall survival (P = 0.04) and approached statistical significance as a predictor of disease-free survival (P = 0.07). CONCLUSIONS: Local excision alone for T1 rectal adenocarcinomas is associated with low recurrence and good survival rates that remain durable with long-term follow-up. T2 lesions treated via local excision and adjuvant therapy are associated with higher recurrence rates.","['Greenberg, Jacob A', 'Shibata, David', 'Herndon, James E 2nd', 'Steele, Glenn D Jr', 'Mayer, Robert', 'Bleday, Ronald']","['Greenberg JA', 'Shibata D', 'Herndon JE 2nd', 'Steele GD Jr', 'Mayer R', 'Bleday R']","[""Department of Surgery, Brigham and Women's Hospital, 75 Francis Street, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA.""]",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Dis Colon Rectum,Diseases of the colon and rectum,0372764,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)']",IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/drug therapy/radiotherapy/*surgery', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/therapeutic use', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Fluorouracil/therapeutic use', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Radiotherapy Dosage', 'Rectal Neoplasms/drug therapy/pathology/radiotherapy/*surgery', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome']",2008/06/10 09:00,2008/08/30 09:00,['2008/06/10 09:00'],"['2007/05/15 00:00 [received]', '2007/08/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/06/15 00:00 [revised]', '2008/06/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/30 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/10 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s10350-008-9231-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Dis Colon Rectum. 2008 Aug;51(8):1185-91; discussion 1191-4. doi: 10.1007/s10350-008-9231-6.

EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: The aims of this study were to examine the strongly lipophilic iron chelator, salicylaldehyde isonicotinoyl hydrazone (SIH), for its ability to protect rat isolated cardiomyocytes against the toxicity of daunorubicin (DAU) and to investigate the effects of SIH on DAU-induced inhibition of proliferation in a leukaemic cell line. Cell toxicity was measured by release of lactate dehydrogenase and staining with Hoechst 33342 or propidium iodide and lipid peroxidation by malonaldehyde formation. KEY RESULTS: SIH fully protected cardiomyocytes against model oxidative injury induced by hydrogen peroxide exposure. SIH also significantly but only partially and with no apparent dose-dependency, reduced DAU-induced cardiomyocyte death. However, the observed protection was not accompanied by decreased lipid peroxidation. In the HL-60 acute promyelocytic leukaemia cell line, SIH did not blunt the antiproliferative efficacy of DAU. Instead, at concentrations that reduced DAU toxicity to cardiomyocytes, SIH enhanced the tumoricidal action of DAU. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: This study demonstrates that iron is most likely involved in anthracycline cardiotoxicity and that iron chelation has protective potential, but apparently through mechanism(s) other than by inhibition of ROS-induced injury. In addition to cardioprotection, iron chelation may have considerable potential to improve the therapeutic action of anthracyclines by enhancing their anticancer efficiency and this potential warrants further investigation.","['Simunek, T', 'Sterba, M', 'Popelova, O', 'Kaiserova, H', 'Adamcova, M', 'Hroch, M', 'Haskova, P', 'Ponka, P', 'Gersl, V']","['Simunek T', 'Sterba M', 'Popelova O', 'Kaiserova H', 'Adamcova M', 'Hroch M', 'Haskova P', 'Ponka P', 'Gersl V']","['Department of Biochemical Sciences, Faculty of Pharmacy, Charles University in Prague, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic. simunekt@faf.cuni.cz']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Pharmacol,British journal of pharmacology,7502536,"['0 (Aldehydes)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Hydrazones)', '0 (Iron Chelating Agents)', '0 (salicylaldehyde isonicotinoyl hydrazone)', '4Y8F71G49Q (Malondialdehyde)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Aldehydes/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*toxicity', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cytoprotection', 'Daunorubicin/*toxicity', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Hydrazones/*pharmacology', 'Iron Chelating Agents/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/metabolism/*pathology', 'Lipid Peroxidation/drug effects', 'Malondialdehyde/metabolism', 'Myocytes, Cardiac/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Oxidative Stress/drug effects', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Time Factors']",2008/06/10 09:00,2008/12/19 09:00,['2008/06/10 09:00'],"['2008/06/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/19 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['bjp2008236 [pii]', '10.1038/bjp.2008.236 [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Pharmacol. 2008 Sep;155(1):138-48. doi: 10.1038/bjp.2008.236.

However, some patients rapidly succumb to disease despite chemotherapy. We studied 56 patients with acute myeloid leukemia associated with t(8;21) and correlated clinicopathologic, cytogenetic and molecular findings with outcome to identify markers of prognosis. In a subset of patients, we also assessed the status of the c-KIT, FLT3 and RAS genes. There were 31 men and 25 women, with a median age of 38 years (range 4-76). The follow-up period ranged from 17 to 104 months (median 52). At the last follow-up, 29 patients had died, 25 patients were in complete remission and two patients were alive with disease. The median survial was 38 months. The 5-year overall survival rate of newly diagnosed patients was 56%. Most patients (39/56, 70%) had chromosomal aberrations in addition to t(8;21), with loss of a sex chromosome (39%) being most common followed by del(9q)(q21-22) (11%) and trisomy 8 (7%). These aberrations, however, did not predict survival. C-KIT (D816V or D816Y), FLT3 (ITD or D835) and RAS mutations were detected in 26, 10 and 7%, respectively, of cases assessed. The 5-year overall survival rate of patients with mutated leukemia was 20%. No mutations were observed in three patients who died within 7 months of diagnosis. Leukocytosis or CD56 expression did not correlate with a poor survival nor did the levels of CD19 expression predict c-KIT mutation status.

However, the recent approach of adapting therapy according to biologic features appears to be resulting in significant progress for specific subsets of adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. RECENT FINDINGS: The present review highlights some of these new risk-adapted approaches focusing on recent advances in treatment of Philadelphia chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia and mature B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia using biologically targeted therapies, and new approaches to treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia in older adolescents and young adults, adopting therapeutic strategies employed in the successful treatment of children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. A recent study that examines the role of allogeneic stem cell transplant for adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia in first remission will also be reviewed. SUMMARY: The subset-specific approach to therapy of adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia is beginning to result in promising improvements in survival. Future improvements in survival of adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia will depend on participation in large cooperative group trials using biologically defined protocols for this relatively rare and heterogeneous group of diseases.","['Larson, Sarah', 'Stock, Wendy']","['Larson S', 'Stock W']","['University of Chicago Medical Center and the University of Chicago Cancer Research Center, University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, USA.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/mortality/*therapy', 'Survival Rate']",2008/06/10 09:00,2008/07/17 09:00,['2008/06/10 09:00'],"['2008/06/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/MOH.0b013e3283034697 [doi]', '00062752-200807000-00019 [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2008 Jul;15(4):400-7. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0b013e3283034697.,4,68,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In hematopoiesis, recent work has improved our understanding of the role of microRNAs in hematopoietic differentiation and leukemogenesis. RECENT FINDINGS: Using animal models engineered to overexpress miR-150, miR-17 approximately 92 and miR-155 or to be deficient for miR-223, miR-155 and miR-17 approximately 92 expression, several groups have now shown that miRNAs are critical for B-lymphocyte development (miR-150 and miR-17 approximately 92), granulopoiesis (miR-223), immune function (miR-155) and B-lymphoproliferative disorders (miR-155 and miR-17 approximately 92). Distinctive miRNA signatures have been described in association with cytogenetics and outcome in acute myeloid leukemia.

However, acute promyelocytic leukemia represents only a small minority (10-15%) of the myeloid leukemias. Recent studies provide significant insight into why some myeloid leukemias respond dramatically to all-trans retinoic acid mediated differentiation therapy, whereas others do not. RECENT FINDINGS: Utilizing in-vitro experimental models of all-trans retinoic acid triggered myeloid leukemia differentiation, specific genes that are important regulators of granulocytic differentiation have been identified including transcription factors, apoptosis regulators, protein synthesis inhibitors and protein degradation factors. Moreover, recent studies have identified repressive chromatin marks generated by the aberrant, acute promyelocytic leukemia specific promyelocytic locus gene-retinoic acid receptor alpha (PML-RARalpha) fusion protein as well as the specific enzymes that mediate these chromatin changes. SUMMARY: The molecular basis for PML-RARalpha- mediated leukemogenesis is complex involving both the repression of numerous potential target genes and critical 'off promoter' functional activity of this fusion protein. The acute promyelocytic leukemia specific repressive chromatin marks related to PML-RARalpha activity may be present in other myeloid leukemias as well. This suggests alternative approaches for treating myeloid leukemia involving therapeutic agents that inhibit heterochromatin formation and enhance transcriptional activity. All-trans retinoic acid or related compounds may also play a significant role in enhancing hematopoietic stem cell self-renewal as well as the production and differentiation of regulatory T cells.","['Collins, Steven J']",['Collins SJ'],"['Human Biology Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington 98109, USA. scollins@fhcrc.org']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,"['0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/*etiology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy/etiology', '*Receptors, Retinoic Acid', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology/therapeutic use']",2008/06/10 09:00,2008/07/17 09:00,['2008/06/10 09:00'],"['2008/06/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/MOH.0b013e3283007edf [doi]', '00062752-200807000-00012 [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2008 Jul;15(4):346-51. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0b013e3283007edf.,4,57,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RECENT FINDINGS: Chromosomal translocations regulate the behavior of leukemia. They not only predict outcome but they define therapy. There is a great deal of knowledge on the products of leukemic translocations, yet little is known about the mechanism by which those translocations occur. Given the large number of DNA double-strand breaks that occur during normal progression through the cell cycle, especially from V(D)J recombination, stalled replication forks or failed decatenation, it is surprising that leukemogenic translocations do not occur more frequently. Fortunately, hematopoietic cells have sophisticated repair mechanisms to suppress such translocations. When these defenses fail leukemia becomes far more common, as seen in inherited deficiencies of DNA repair. Analyzing translocation sequences in cellular and animal models, and in human leukemias, has yielded new insights into the mechanisms of leukemogenic translocations. SUMMARY: New data from animal models suggest a two hit origin of leukemic translocations, where there must be both a defect in DNA double-strand break repair and a subsequent failure of cell cycle arrest for leukemogenesis.","['Nickoloff, Jac A', 'De Haro, Leyma P', 'Wray, Justin', 'Hromas, Robert']","['Nickoloff JA', 'De Haro LP', 'Wray J', 'Hromas R']","['Department of Molecular Genetics and Microbiology, the University of New Mexico Cancer Center, Albuquerque, New Mexico 87131, USA.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,,IM,"['Cell Cycle', 'DNA Repair/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/etiology/*genetics', '*Translocation, Genetic']",2008/06/10 09:00,2008/07/17 09:00,['2008/06/10 09:00'],"['2008/06/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/MOH.0b013e328302f711 [doi]', '00062752-200807000-00011 [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2008 Jul;15(4):338-45. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0b013e328302f711.,4,,,"['F31 CA132628/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM084020/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC3993924,['NIHMS570233'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Congenital neutropenia is a heterogeneous disorder of hematopoiesis characterized by a maturation arrest of granulopoiesis at the level of promyelocytes with peripheral blood absolute neutrophil counts below 0.5 x 10/l. RECENT FINDINGS: There are two major subtypes of congenital neutropenia as judged by inheritance, comprising the majority of congenital neutropenia patients: autosomal dominant trait defined by neutrophil elastase mutations consisting of 60% of patients and autosomal recessive trait comprising approximately 30% of patients, both presenting with the same clinical and morphological phenotype. Congenital neutropenia is considered as a preleukemic syndrome, as the cumulative incidence for leukemia is more than 25% after 20 years of observation. Acquired CSF3R mutations are detected in approximately 80% of congenital neutropenia patients who developed acute myeloid leukemia suggesting that these mutations are involved in leukemogenesis. One possible pathomechanism causing leukemia is that clones of cells harboring acquired CSF3R mutations have a growth advantage over wild type cells in vivo during granulocyte-colony stimulating factor treatment due to activation of STAT5 and ss-catenin, both known to be involved in leukemogenesis. SUMMARY: Congenital neutropenia patients with acquired CSF3R mutations define a group with high risk for development of leukemia.","['Germeshausen, Manuela', 'Skokowa, Julia', 'Ballmaier, Matthias', 'Zeidler, Cornelia', 'Welte, Karl']","['Germeshausen M', 'Skokowa J', 'Ballmaier M', 'Zeidler C', 'Welte K']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Medical University Hannover, Hannover, Germany.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,"['0 (Receptors, Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Humans', 'Leukemia/etiology/pathology', 'Leukopoiesis', '*Mutation', 'Neutropenia/congenital/*genetics', 'Receptors, Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*genetics']",2008/06/10 09:00,2008/07/17 09:00,['2008/06/10 09:00'],"['2008/06/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/MOH.0b013e328303b9f6 [doi]', '00062752-200807000-00010 [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2008 Jul;15(4):332-7. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0b013e328303b9f6.,4,41,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RECENT FINDINGS: Recent large international studies suggested that allogeneic umbilical cord blood transplantation may potentially emerge as the frontline stem cell source for pediatric patients with hematopoietic malignancies because of its ability to confer superior overall and relapse-free survival compared with matched marrow stem cells. In adults, umbilical cord blood transplantation, double umbilical cord blood units and nonmyeloablative engraftment strategies have attracted further attention in clinical practice with the advantages of possible stronger graft-versus-leukemia effect and expanding transplantation indications. Additional advances in the basic biology of umbilical cord blood also appear very promising in development of enhanced engraftment approaches for limiting hematopoietic stem cell numbers or expansion of repopulating cells. SUMMARY: Umbilical cord blood is a valuable alternative source of hematopoietic stem cells for patients that require allogeneic transplantation in the absence of readily available human leukocyte antigen matched marrow or blood hematopoietic stem cells. The current advances in clinical and biological research will further expand its application in pediatric and adult hematopoietic stem cells transplantation for treating hematologic disorders.","['Tse, William', 'Bunting, Kevin D', 'Laughlin, Mary J']","['Tse W', 'Bunting KD', 'Laughlin MJ']","['Division of Medical Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, Aurora, Colorado, USA']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,,IM,"['Adult', 'Child', 'Cord Blood Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods/trends', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Transplantation Conditioning/methods', 'Treatment Outcome']",2008/06/10 09:00,2008/07/17 09:00,['2008/06/10 09:00'],"['2008/06/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/MOH.0b013e328304ae2c [doi]', '00062752-200807000-00002 [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2008 Jul;15(4):279-84. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0b013e328304ae2c.,4,35,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A cancer diagnosis can represent a 'teachable moment', leading survivors to make positive changes in diet and exercise behaviors; however, little is known about how often this occurs or about factors that enhance or limit survivors' ability to make these changes. This cross-sectional descriptive study investigated both the prevalence and clustering of self-reported changes in diet and exercise and how these changes related to ongoing cancer-related symptoms, social support, and stressful life events among long-term breast cancer survivors. METHODS: Survivors (n=227, response rate=72%) of a prior Cancer and Leukemia Group B treatment trial, on average 12 years post-diagnosis, completed a mailed survey assessing health behavior changes since diagnosis and current symptoms, social support, and stressful life events. RESULTS: Over half of survivors reported making positive exercise or diet changes since diagnosis: over 25% reported making exercise and diet changes. Analyses of covariance models showed that survivors who reported increasing their exercise also reported lower fatigue. Trends were also found between increased fruit and vegetable intake and decreased fatigue and between increased exercise and increased social support. CONCLUSIONS: These results underscore the need for health promotion efforts among survivors. Exercise promotion is especially needed since more survivors attempted to change dietary behaviors than exercise on their own. Further, fatigue may limit survivors' ability to change their health behaviors; alternatively, survivors who increase their exercise may experience less fatigue.","['Alfano, Catherine M', 'Day, Jeannette M', 'Katz, Mira L', 'Herndon, James E 2nd', 'Bittoni, Marisa A', 'Oliveri, Jill M', 'Donohue, Kathleen', 'Paskett, Electra D']","['Alfano CM', 'Day JM', 'Katz ML', 'Herndon JE 2nd', 'Bittoni MA', 'Oliveri JM', 'Donohue K', 'Paskett ED']","['The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center and College of Public Health, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.

During embryogenesis, WT1 is expressed in a time- and tissue-specific manner in various organs including gonads and kidney but also in the hematopoietic system. Although widely regarded as a tumor suppressor gene, wild-type WT1 is overexpressed in a variety of hematologic malignancies, most notably in acute lymphoblastic leukemia as well as myelodysplastic syndromes. Reduction of WT1 expression levels leads to decrease of proliferation and apoptosis of leukemic cells, suggesting that in certain contexts WT1 might act as an oncogene. We show here that histone deacetylase inhibitors like Trichostatin A (TSA) can promptly and dramatically downregulate Wt1 expression levels in different cell lines. This effect was mostly due to the cessation of transcription and was mediated by sequences located in intron 3 of Wt1. In addition, TSA also caused enhanced degradation of the Wt1 protein by the proteasome. This was at least in part due to induction of the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBCH8. Thus, downregulation of Wt1 expression might contribute to the beneficial effects of histone deacetylase inhibitors that are currently used in clinical trials as cancer therapeutics.","['Makki, Mohammad Shahidul', 'Heinzel, Thorsten', 'Englert, Christoph']","['Makki MS', 'Heinzel T', 'Englert C']","['Leibniz Institute for Age Research - Fritz Lipmann Institute, Beutenbergstrasse 11, 07745 Jena, Germany.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Nucleic Acids Res,Nucleic acids research,0411011,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)', '3X2S926L3Z (trichostatin A)', 'EC 2.3.2.23 (UBE2L6 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.23 (Ubiquitin-Conjugating Enzymes)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Down-Regulation', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', '*Genes, Wilms Tumor', '*Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Ubiquitin-Conjugating Enzymes/metabolism', 'WT1 Proteins/*metabolism']",2008/06/07 09:00,2008/08/13 09:00,['2008/06/07 09:00'],"['2008/06/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/13 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['gkn356 [pii]', '10.1093/nar/gkn356 [doi]']",ppublish,Nucleic Acids Res. 2008 Jul;36(12):4067-78. doi: 10.1093/nar/gkn356.

In addition, the influence of phorbol ester (PMA) on PML NBs formation was analyzed. A reduced number of PML bodies, which led to relocation of PML NBs closer to the nuclear interior, mostly accompanied RA- and PMA-induced differentiation. Centrally located PML NBs were associated with transcriptional protein RNAP II and SC35 regions, which support importance of PML NBs in RNA processing that mostly proceeds within the nuclear interior. Conversely, the quantity of PML NBs was increased after cytostatic treatment, which caused re-distribution of PML NBs closer to the nuclear envelope. Here we showed correlations between the number of PML NBs and average Centre-to-PML distances. Moreover, a number of cells in S phase, especially during differentiation, influenced number of PML NBs.

However, the molecular mechanism by which Lf influences these cellular responses remains unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that Lf-induced apoptosis in Jurkat T cells occurs in a dose- and time-dependent manner via the regulation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activity. Jurkat cells exposed to Lf for 1 day, especially at concentrations in excess of 500 microg/ml, showed typical apoptosis, as indicated by decreased cell viability and increased Annexin V binding. Our results also showed that Lf induced the activation of caspase 9 and caspase 3 activation, as demonstrated by our detection of cleaved caspases and PARP. Lf-induced apoptosis did not influence Bcl-2 expression via an ERK1/2 phosphorylation pathway, but was rather associated with the level of Bcl-2 phosphorylation. The treatment of cells with the specific JNK inhibitor SP600125, but not the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580, revealed that the JNK-Bcl-2 signaling cascade is required for Lf-induced apoptosis. When JNK activation was abolished by SP600125, no Bcl-2 phosphorylation was detected, and the Lf-treated Jurkat cells did not undergo cell death. These findings indicate that Lf functions as a biological mediator of apoptosis in the human leukemia Jurkat T-cell line, via the JNK-associated Bcl-2 signaling pathway.","['Lee, Shin-Hee', 'Park, Sang Won', 'Pyo, Chul-Woong', 'Yoo, Na-Kyung', 'Kim, Jiyoung', 'Choi, Sang-Yun']","['Lee SH', 'Park SW', 'Pyo CW', 'Yoo NK', 'Kim J', 'Choi SY']","['School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Korea University, 5 Anam-dong Sungbuk-gu, Seoul 136-701, Republic of Korea.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",France,Biochimie,Biochimie,1264604,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Lactoferrin)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Jurkat Cells/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Lactoferrin/*pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/*physiology']",2008/06/07 09:00,2009/05/06 09:00,['2008/06/07 09:00'],"['2008/03/24 00:00 [received]', '2008/05/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/06/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/06 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0300-9084(08)00126-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.biochi.2008.05.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochimie. 2009 Jan;91(1):102-8. doi: 10.1016/j.biochi.2008.05.004.

The accelerated phase (AP) and blast crisis (BC) of CML are usually manifested by additionally acquired oncogene aberrations, resistance to therapy, advancing anaplasia, progressive organomegaly, and increased blast count. Abnormal expression of some proto-oncogenes may accompany or even precede AP or BC of CML. Our objective was to follow-up oncogene expression over time covering different clinical phases of CML. A total of 85 patients [44 females and 41 males; median age 51 years; range 16-75 years] were studied. At the start of the study, 29 patients were in CP, 25 in an AP, and 31 in BC. Temporal variation in expression (percentage positivity per 1000 analyzed cells) of c-kit, c-myc, H-Ras, cyclin A1, p53, bcl-2 and VEGF oncogenic proteins in CP, AP, and BC of CML was studied by immunohistochemical procedures. This was then correlated with parameters of clinical disease (organomegaly, duration of CP, AP, and BC) and laboratory (Hb, WBC and platelet counts, and the percentage of blasts) data. The level of c-kit expression differed significantly over the course of disease (x(2), p = 0 x 025). Antiapoptotic bcl-2 protein increased significantly with the progression of CML (x(2), p = 0 x 005). The expression of c-myc was most pronounced in the AP (Anova, p = 0 x 033) and then tended to decline. There was no significant difference in the level of expression of H-Ras, cyclin A1 and p53 over the course of disease. The expression of VEGF protein was most pronounced in the AP (Anova, p = 0 x 033) and it was inversely correlated with degree of splenomegaly (Pearson, r = -0 x 400, p = 0 x 011) and overall survival (log rank, p = 0,042). CONCLUSION: The changes in oncogene expression, assessed by immunohistochemical approach over the course of CML may have clinical relevance in deciding on and timing of therapy. Temporal distribution of changes in oncoprotein expression in CML requires further study at the molecular level.","['Vidovic, Ana', 'Jankovic, Gradimir', 'Colovic, Milica', 'Tomin, Dragica', 'Perunicic, Maja', 'Bila, Jelena', 'Markovic, Olivera', 'Boskovic, Darinka']","['Vidovic A', 'Jankovic G', 'Colovic M', 'Tomin D', 'Perunicic M', 'Bila J', 'Markovic O', 'Boskovic D']","['Institute of Hematology, Clinical Center of Serbia, Belgrade, Serbia. vidana@drenik.net']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,"['0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (MYC protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (VEGFA protein, human)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Blast Crisis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/*metabolism', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/genetics/metabolism']",2008/06/07 09:00,2008/08/05 09:00,['2008/06/07 09:00'],"['2008/06/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/05 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/07 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1179/102453308X315807 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematology. 2008 Feb;13(1):34-40. doi: 10.1179/102453308X315807.,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cytogenetic abnormalities and age are the prognostic factors that guide treatment decisions. However, many AML patients still die. The biological factors that influence treatment outcome are largely unknown. Thus, the objective of our study was to use the in vitro viability test to correlate with treatment outcome. Acute myeloid leukaemia blasts demonstrated differing ability to survive in culture. Our examination of blast phenotype at various days in culture showed two possible growth directions. First, cells underwent maturation by increased expression of CD16 and down-regulated CD34 (a haemopoietic stem cell marker). These cells also appeared to have undergone apoptosis. Alternatively, cells continued to survive in culture and maintained high expression of CD34. An MTT assay was carried out to determine viability after three days of culture. Lower optical density values were obtained for samples that underwent apoptosis and higher values were obtained for samples that survived in culture. Apoptosis was measured by Annexin V/propidium iodide staining. A comparison between results of MTT assay and duration of disease free survival revealed that a higher viability in vitro correlated significantly with shorter survival duration in the patient (R -0.761, p=0.002, n=13). Thus, this study further supports the hypothesis that AML patients with poor survival may be related to having blasts with a biologically more immature or stem cell-like nature.","['Maha, Abdullah', 'Cheong, Soon-Keng', 'Leong, Chooi-Fun', 'Seow, Heng-Fong']","['Maha A', 'Cheong SK', 'Leong CF', 'Seow HF']","['Immunology Unit, Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Universiti Putra Malaysia, Malaysia. maha@medic.upm.edu.my']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Apoptosis', '*Cell Differentiation', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Granulocyte Precursor Cells/*pathology', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Phenotype', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Analysis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2008/06/07 09:00,2008/08/05 09:00,['2008/06/07 09:00'],"['2008/06/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/05 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/07 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1179/102453308X315762 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematology. 2008 Feb;13(1):13-20. doi: 10.1179/102453308X315762.,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although conventional chemotherapy can cure between 25 and 45% of AML patients, the majority of patients die after relapse or of complications associated with treatment. Thus, more specific and less toxic treatments for AML patients are needed, especially for elderly patients. An indispensable prerequisite to investigate tailored approaches for AML is the recent progress in the understanding the molecular features that distinguish leukemia progenitors from normal hematopoietic counterparts and the identification of a variety of dysregulated molecular pathways. This in turn would allow the identification of tumor-specific characteristics that provide a rational basis for the development of more tailored, and hence potentially more effective and less toxic, therapeutic approaches. In this review, we describe some of the signaling pathways that are aberrantly regulated in AML, with a specific focus on their pathogenetic and therapeutic significance, and we examine some recent therapies directed against these targets, used in clinical trial for relapsed patients or unfit for conventional chemotherapy.","['Palmisano, Michela', 'Grafone, Tiziana', 'Renzulli, Matteo', 'Ottaviani, Emanuela', 'Testoni, Nicoletta', 'Paolini, Stefania', 'Papayannidis, Cristina', 'Baccarani, Michele', 'Martinelli, Giovanni']","['Palmisano M', 'Grafone T', 'Renzulli M', 'Ottaviani E', 'Testoni N', 'Paolini S', 'Papayannidis C', 'Baccarani M', 'Martinelli G']","['Institute of Hematology and Medical Oncology L. e A.

There are rare occasions when the abdominal pain is derived from extra-abdominal organs or systems. The aim of the present study was to establish the most common extra-abdominal causes of acute abdominal pain. METHODS: The notes of all children (1 month-14 years of age) examined for acute abdominal pain in the Accident and Emergency (A&E) Department of Alexandroupolis District University Hospital in January 2001-December 2005 were analyzed retrospectively. Demographic data, clinical signs and symptoms, and laboratory findings were recorded, as well as the final diagnosis and outcome. RESULTS: Of a total number of 28 124 children who were brought to the A&E department, in 1731 the main complaint was acute abdominal pain. In 51 children their symptoms had an extra-abdominal cause, the most frequent being pneumonia (n = 15), tonsillitis (n = 10), otitis media (n = 9), and acute leukemia (n = 5). CONCLUSION: Both abdominal and extra-abdominal causes should be considered by a pediatrician who is confronted with a child with acute abdominal pain.","['Tsalkidis, Aggelos', 'Gardikis, Stefanos', 'Cassimos, Dimitrios', 'Kambouri, Katerina', 'Tsalkidou, Evanthia', 'Deftereos, Savas', 'Chatzimichael, Athanasios']","['Tsalkidis A', 'Gardikis S', 'Cassimos D', 'Kambouri K', 'Tsalkidou E', 'Deftereos S', 'Chatzimichael A']","['Department of Pediatrics, University Hospital of Alexandroupolis, Democritus University of Thrace-Medical School, Alexandroupolis, Greece. atsalkid@med.duth.gr']",,['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Australia,Pediatr Int,Pediatrics international : official journal of the Japan Pediatric Society,100886002,,IM,"['Abdomen, Acute/diagnosis/*etiology', 'Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/*complications/diagnosis', 'Male', 'Otitis Media/*complications/diagnosis', 'Pneumonia/*complications/diagnosis', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Tonsillitis/*complications/diagnosis']",2008/06/07 09:00,2008/08/01 09:00,['2008/06/07 09:00'],"['2008/06/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/01 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['PED2578 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1442-200X.2008.02578.x [doi]']",ppublish,Pediatr Int. 2008 Jun;50(3):315-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1442-200X.2008.02578.x.,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, hepatomegaly, and splenomegaly were present. Results of a CBC revealed marked leukocytosis (62,600/microL; reference interval 4000-15,500/microL) and large numbers of atypical cells (30,700/microL) with abundant cytoplasm. There was no concurrent anemia, neutropenia, or thrombocytopenia. Morphology of the atypical cells was most consistent with a histiocytic origin. Similar cells were identified in bone marrow aspirates, and were morphologically suggestive of the macrophage variant of disseminated histiocytic sarcoma. However, flow cytometry of the abnormal circulating cells revealed CD1c, CD11c, and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) Class II expression without expression of CD11d or lymphoid markers, consistent with myeloid dendritic antigen-presenting cells. At necropsy, the splenic architecture was effaced by neoplastic histiocytes that were also infiltrating lung, liver, an abdominal lymph node, myocardium, an bone marrow. Immunohistochemistry of the splenic neoplastic cells confirmed dendritic cell origin (CD1c+, CD11c+, MHC II+, no expression of CD11d and lymphoid markers).

The ability to integrate their DNA into the DNA of infected cells also makes retroviruses attractive vectors for delivery of therapeutic genes into the genome of cells carrying adverse mutations in their cellular DNA. Sequencing of the entire human genome has enabled identification of integration site preferences of both replication-competent retroviruses and retroviral vectors. These results, together with the unfortunate outcome of a gene therapy trial, in which integration of a retroviral vector in the vicinity of a protooncogene was associated with the development of leukemia, have stimulated efforts to elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying integration site selection by retroviral vectors, as well as the development of methods to direct integration to specific DNA sequences and chromosomal regions. This review outlines our current knowledge of the mechanism of integration site selection by retroviruses in vitro, in cultured cells, and in vivo; the outcome of several of the more recent gene therapy trials, which employed these vectors; and the efforts of several laboratories to develop vectors that integrate at predetermined sites in the human genome.","['Daniel, Rene', 'Smith, Johanna A']","['Daniel R', 'Smith JA']","['Division of Infectious Diseases, Center for Human Virology, Kimmel Cancer Center, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA 19107, USA.

CML is invariably associated with a specific genetic lesion--the t(9;22) chromosomal translocation. As a consequence of this translocation, a BCR-ABL fusion gene is formed on the 22q- derivative (traditionally known as the Philadelphia chromosome) and the deregulated tyrosine kinase activity of the protein encoded by this gene has been shown to be both necessary and sufficient for initiation and maintenance of the disease. Imatinib mesylate, an orally available tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets Bcr-Abl, entered clinical evaluation in 1998. Its efficacy surpassed almost everyone's predictions, and the observation of high response rates and favorable toxicity profile associated with imatinib therapy led to its approval as first-line treatment for all newly diagnosed CML patients over an exceptionally short period of time. The 6-year results of the Phase III trial have recently been reported and confirm durability of responses and declining incidence of adverse events over time, although, at present, occurrence of unexpected side effects in the long term cannot be excluded. Although imatinib does not 'cure' CML and has to be administered chronically to patients, it has revolutionized both outcome and quality of life of CML patients.","['Soverini, Simona', 'Martinelli, Giovanni', 'Iacobucci, Ilaria', 'Baccarani, Michele']","['Soverini S', 'Martinelli G', 'Iacobucci I', 'Baccarani M']","['Department of Hematology & Oncological Sciences ""Lorenzo e Ariosto Seragnoli"" University of Bologna, Via Massarenti 9, 40138 Bologna, Italy. simona.soverini@tin.it']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Expert Rev Anticancer Ther,Expert review of anticancer therapy,101123358,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/physiopathology', 'Piperazines/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Quality of Life', 'Treatment Outcome']",2008/06/07 09:00,2008/07/18 09:00,['2008/06/07 09:00'],"['2008/06/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/18 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/07 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1586/14737140.8.6.853 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Rev Anticancer Ther. 2008 Jun;8(6):853-64. doi: 10.1586/14737140.8.6.853.,6,82,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHOD: 80% ethanol extracts of S. parasitica parasitizing on Nernium indicum, Morus alba, Opsmanthus fragrans, and Sapindus mulorossi were purified by polyamides column chromatography, and the eluates of 30%, 50%, 70% and 90% ethanol were mixed as flavonoids extracts. Human acute myeloid leukemia cell line HL-60 was used to evaluate the cytotoxicity induced by flavonoids extracts of S. parasitica L with MTT assay. Apoptosis was detected by AO/EB fluorescence staining and DNA fragmentation analysis, apoptosis rates and cell cycle distribution were detected by flow cytometry analysis. RESULT: Extract of S. parasitica parasitizing on N. indicum (NISPEX) was the most sensitive to HL-60 cells of the 4 different host trees, the IC50 value being 0.60 mg x L(-1); and extract of S. parasitica parasitizing on M. alba took the second place, the IC50 value, being 2.49 mg x L(-1); extract of S. parasitica parasitizing on O. fragrans had no effectiveness as high as 50 mg x L(-1) concentration. NISPEX induced HL-60 cell apoptosis and inhibited the cell proliferation in dose and time-dependent manner. Cell cycles were arrested at G0-G1 phase after treated with NISPEX. CONCLUSION: Anticancer effects of S. parasitica correlated with the host trees. Flavonoids extracts of S. parasitica parasitizing on N. indicum exhibited comparatively better anticancer activity in vitro among the host trees studied. NISPEX is found to be a good candidate for anticancer.","['Xiao, Yi-Jun', 'Chen, Yuan-Zhong', 'Chen, Bing-Hua', 'Chen, Jian-Hu', 'Lin, Zhen-Xing', 'Fan, Yan-Li']","['Xiao YJ', 'Chen YZ', 'Chen BH', 'Chen JH', 'Lin ZX', 'Fan YL']","['Fujian Institute of Hematology, Affiliated Union Hospital, Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou 350001, China.']",,['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",China,Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi,Zhongguo Zhong yao za zhi = Zhongguo zhongyao zazhi = China journal of Chinese materia medica,8913656,"['0 (Drugs, Chinese Herbal)', '0 (Flavonoids)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Drugs, Chinese Herbal/chemistry/isolation & purification/pharmacology', 'Flavonoids/*chemistry/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Loranthaceae/*chemistry']",2008/06/07 09:00,2009/04/25 09:00,['2008/06/07 09:00'],"['2008/06/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/25 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/07 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi. 2008 Feb;33(4):427-32.,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The examined parameters included clinical observation of oropharyngeal mucosa, type of malignant disease and intake of chemotherapy and antimicrobial treatment. METHODS: The gingival and mucosal status of the patients was recorded before each sampling procedure. Samples were collected by oropharyngeal swabbing in children with leukaemia or other oncological diseases for isolation of Capnocytophaga strains. RESULTS: Capnocytophaga strains were more often isolated in samples from children with oncological diseases (71%) other than leukaemia (57%). Concomitant chemotherapy had no influence on oral Capnocytophaga carriage. A significant decrease of the prevalence of Capnocytophaga strains isolated was observed in children who received antimicrobial treatment within 8 days before the sampling procedure (15.5% vs. 28%). But, the incidence of beta-lactamase-producing strains was not linked to previous antimicrobial treatments. CONCLUSION: Oral carriage of Capnocytophaga strains can be linked to haematological disease and previous antibiotherapy, but results did not confirm that beta-lactamase treatments exert a selective pressure. Other factors might be involved in emerging for oral beta-lactamase-producing Capnocytophaga strains.","['Jolivet-Gougeon, Anne', 'Guerin, Jacques', 'Tamanai-Shacoori, Zohreh', 'Gandemer, Virginie', 'Sixou, Jean-Louis', 'Bonnaure-Mallet, Martine']","['Jolivet-Gougeon A', 'Guerin J', 'Tamanai-Shacoori Z', 'Gandemer V', 'Sixou JL', 'Bonnaure-Mallet M']","['Equipe de Microbiologie, UPRES-EA 1254, Universite de Rennes, Rennes, France. anne.gougeon@univ-rennes1.fr']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Norway,Acta Paediatr,"Acta paediatrica (Oslo, Norway : 1992)",9205968,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', 'EC 3.5.2.6 (beta-Lactamases)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Capnocytophaga/enzymology/*isolation & purification', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*microbiology', 'Oropharynx/*microbiology', 'beta-Lactamases/*biosynthesis']",2008/06/06 09:00,2008/11/04 09:00,['2008/06/06 09:00'],"['2008/06/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/11/04 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/06 09:00 [entrez]']","['APA824 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1651-2227.2008.00824.x [doi]']",ppublish,Acta Paediatr. 2008 Jul;97(7):964-7. doi: 10.1111/j.1651-2227.2008.00824.x.,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Conventional chemotherapeutic regimens, which almost invariably include cytarabine and anthracyclines, are untargeted, and more specific therapies are needed. OBJECTIVE: We have chosen acute myeloid leukemia as a disease prototype to review established and novel targeted approaches in leukemia treatment. METHODS: Our selection of the reviewed literature focused on drug delivery aspects. CONCLUSION: While the toxicity profile of chemotherapeutics has been improved by liposomal formulations and antibody conjugation for leukemia-directed uptake, their efficacy has probably not changed significantly. Drugs with an alternative mode of action, including kinase inhibitors, hold great promise. Further improvements may result from the characterization of novel acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell surface receptors and of leukemic stem cells, as well as from the design of leukemia-targeted gene therapy vectors.","['Kohlschutter, Johannes', 'Michelfelder, Stefan', 'Trepel, Martin']","['Kohlschutter J', 'Michelfelder S', 'Trepel M']","['University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Department of Oncology and Hematology, Martinistrasse 52, D-20246 Hamburg, Germany.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Expert Opin Drug Deliv,Expert opinion on drug delivery,101228421,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CD33 protein, human)', '0 (Integrin alpha4beta1)', '0 (Liposomes)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/administration & dosage', 'Antigens, CD/immunology', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/immunology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Genetic Therapy', 'Humans', 'Integrin alpha4beta1/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy', 'Liposomes', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3']",2008/06/06 09:00,2008/10/29 09:00,['2008/06/06 09:00'],"['2008/06/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/29 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/06 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1517/17425247.5.6.653 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Drug Deliv. 2008 Jun;5(6):653-63. doi: 10.1517/17425247.5.6.653.,6,114,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Melanoma represents only 4% of all skin cancers, but nearly 80% of skin cancer deaths. In loss of potential productive life-years, it is second only to adult leukemia. Once melanoma spreads to regional and distant sites, the chance of cure decreases significantly. Unfortunately, current diagnostic and prognostic methods are often inadequate. More precise staging and disease characterization will lead to new and more rational approaches to treatment. Proteomics is a fast-growing discipline in biomedicine that can be defined as the global characterization and differential expression of the entire protein complement of a cell, tissue or organism. Despite major advances in molecular approaches to the diagnosis and prognostication of human diseases such as melanoma, there remain significant obstacles in applying the proteomic technologies to clinical samples to extract important biological information. The application of a shotgun-based technique termed direct tissue proteomics with improved extraction protocol of proteins from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue would enable retrospective biomarker investigations of the vast archive of pathologically characterized clinical samples that exist worldwide. Combination of this direct tissue proteomics method with laser-capture microdissection may assist in the discovery of new biomarkers and may lead to new diagnostic tests, risk assessment and staging tools as well as improvement in therapeutics. In addition, these tools can provide a molecular characterization of melanoma, which may enable individualized molecular therapy.","['Rezaul, Karim', 'Wilson, Lori L', 'Han, David K']","['Rezaul K', 'Wilson LL', 'Han DK']","['University of Connecticut Health Center, Center for Vascular Biology, Department of Cell Biology, 263 Farmington Avenue, Farmington, CT 06030, USA. karim@neuron.uchc.edu']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Expert Rev Proteomics,Expert review of proteomics,101223548,['0 (Biomarkers)'],IM,"['Biomarkers', 'Humans', 'Mass Spectrometry/methods', 'Melanoma/*metabolism', '*Proteomics', 'Skin Neoplasms/*metabolism']",2008/06/06 09:00,2008/08/12 09:00,['2008/06/06 09:00'],"['2008/06/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/12 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/06 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1586/14789450.5.3.405 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Rev Proteomics. 2008 Jun;5(3):405-12. doi: 10.1586/14789450.5.3.405.,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All epidemiological case control and cohort studies published in English between 1990 and 2006 that reported at least the size of the study population and risk estimates were included. Results were summarized separately for pre- and postnatal exposure and for each cancer site. Nineteen case control studies and six cohort studies matched the inclusion criteria. No association of leukemia with prenatal exposures was observed in nine case control studies. Heterogeneous results were found for postnatal exposures and leukemia in four studies. No significant effect of pre- and postnatal X-ray exposure was observed for other cancer sites (non-Hodgkin lymphomas, solid tumors and brain tumors). Most studies have limitations in study design, study size, or exposure measurement, and involve very low exposures. These results thus do not contradict previous evidence accumulated since 1956 indicating risk increases associated with prenatal X-ray exposure.

In the majority of cases, renal impairment is caused by the accumulation and precipitation of light chains, which form casts in the distal tubules, resulting in renal obstruction. In addition, myeloma light chains are also directly toxic on proximal renal tubules, further adding to renal dysfunction. Adequate hydration, correction of hypercalcemia and hyperuricemia and antimyeloma therapy should be initiated promptly. Recovery of renal function has been reported in a significant proportion of patients treated with conventional chemotherapy, especially when high-dose dexamethasone is also used. Severe renal impairment and large amount of proteinuria are associated with a lower probability of renal recovery. Novel agents, such as thalidomide, bortezomib and lenalidomide, have significant activity in pretreated and untreated MM patients. Although there is limited experience with thalidomide and lenalidomide in patients with renal failure, data suggest that bortezomib may be beneficial in this population.

TKs are excellent drug targets as exemplified by the activity of imatinib in BCR-ABL1-positive disease, particularly chronic myeloid leukemia. Resistance to imatinib is seen in a minority of cases and is often associated with the appearance of secondary point mutations within the TK domain of BCR-ABL1. These mutations are highly variable in their sensitivity to increased doses of imatinib or alternative TK inhibitors such as nilotinib or dasatinib. Selective and non-selective inhibitors of JAK2 are currently being developed, and encouraging data from pre-clinical experiments and initial phase-I studies regarding efficacy and potential toxicity of these compounds have already been reported.","['Walz, C', 'Cross, N C P', 'Van Etten, R A', 'Reiter, A']","['Walz C', 'Cross NC', 'Van Etten RA', 'Reiter A']","['Molecular Oncology Research Institute, Tufts Medical Center, Boston, MA, USA.']",,['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Autoantigens)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (PCM1 protein, human)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Autoantigens/genetics', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/genetics', 'Genes, abl', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2/antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/*genetics', '*Mutation', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Polycythemia Vera/genetics', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/genetics', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl/antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/*genetics']",2008/06/06 09:00,2008/08/30 09:00,['2008/06/06 09:00'],"['2008/06/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/30 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/06 09:00 [entrez]']","['leu2008133 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2008.133 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2008 Jul;22(7):1320-34. doi: 10.1038/leu.2008.133.

Here we report additional mutations located in exon 10 of MPL in PMF patients. We investigated whether these new mutations also lead to cell transformation. MPL exon 10 was systematically sequenced in 100 PMF patients. Seven different mutations were found in eight patients. We introduced each MPL mutant in Ba/F3 cells to determine whether they correspond to gain-of-function mutations. Only MPL W515 mutations induced (1) Ba/F3 proliferation independently of growth factors, (2) tumorigenesis in nude mice, (3) spontaneous activation of JAK/STAT, RAS/MAPK and PI3K transduction pathways and (4) increased S phase of cell cycle. Similar to all other myeloproliferative disorder oncogenic events identified to date, these results demonstrate that only the detected MPL W515 mutations trigger spontaneous MPL activation leading to a G(1)/S transition activation. The other mutations are devoid of significant transforming activity but may synergize with JAK2 V617F or other not yet characterized molecular events.","['Chaligne, R', 'Tonetti, C', 'Besancenot, R', 'Roy, L', 'Marty, C', 'Mossuz, P', 'Kiladjian, J-J', 'Socie, G', 'Bordessoule, D', 'Le Bousse-Kerdiles, M-C', 'Vainchenker, W', 'Giraudier, S']","['Chaligne R', 'Tonetti C', 'Besancenot R', 'Roy L', 'Marty C', 'Mossuz P', 'Kiladjian JJ', 'Socie G', 'Bordessoule D', 'Le Bousse-Kerdiles MC', 'Vainchenker W', 'Giraudier S']","['INSERM, U790, Villejuif, France.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Mpl protein, mouse)', '0 (Receptors, Thrombopoietin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Proliferation', '*G1 Phase', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', '*Mutation', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/*genetics/pathology', 'Receptors, Thrombopoietin/*genetics', '*S Phase', 'Signal Transduction']",2008/06/06 09:00,2008/09/13 09:00,['2008/06/06 09:00'],"['2008/06/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/13 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/06 09:00 [entrez]']","['leu2008137 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2008.137 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2008 Aug;22(8):1557-66. doi: 10.1038/leu.2008.137.

Noscapine is a nontoxic ingredient in cough medicine currently used in clinical trials for patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or chronic lymphocytic leukemia to assess antitumor efficacy. Here, we have evaluated the sensitivity of four human glioma cell lines to noscapine-induced apoptosis. Noscapine was a potent inhibitor of proliferation and inducer of apoptosis. Induction of apoptosis was associated with activation of the c-jun N-terminal kinase signaling pathway concomitant with inactivation of the extracellular signal regulated kinase signaling pathway and phosphorylation of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2. Noscapine-induced apoptosis was associated with the release of mitochondrial proteins apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) and/or cytochrome c. In some glioma cell lines, only AIF release occurred without cytochrome c release or poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage. Knock-down of AIF decreased noscapine-induced apoptosis. Our results suggest the potential importance of noscapine as a novel agent for use in patients with glioblastoma owing to its low toxicity profile and its potent anticancer activity.","['Newcomb, Elizabeth W', 'Lukyanov, Yevgeniy', 'Smirnova, Iva', 'Schnee, Tona', 'Zagzag, David']","['Newcomb EW', 'Lukyanov Y', 'Smirnova I', 'Schnee T', 'Zagzag D']","['Department of Pathology, New York University School of Medicine, New York, NY 10016, USA. newcoe01@med.nyu.edu']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Anticancer Drugs,Anti-cancer drugs,9100823,"['0 (Apoptosis Inducing Factor)', '0 (CCNB1 protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin B)', '0 (Cyclin B1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '8V32U4AOQU (Noscapine)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Apoptosis Inducing Factor/*physiology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cyclin B/analysis', 'Cyclin B1', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'Glioma/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Humans', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/drug effects', 'Noscapine/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/analysis']",2008/06/06 09:00,2008/10/15 09:00,['2008/06/06 09:00'],"['2008/06/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/15 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/06 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/CAD.0b013e3282ffd68d [doi]', '00001813-200807000-00001 [pii]']",ppublish,Anticancer Drugs. 2008 Jul;19(6):553-63. doi: 10.1097/CAD.0b013e3282ffd68d.,6,,,"['CA100426/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'NS057829/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, the prevalence of the disease was examined in a total of 129 chickens in three other zoological gardens by nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR), reverse transcription nested PCR and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Twenty-six to 56 percent of the fowls in each of the examined gardens were positive by nested PCR. The phylogenetic analysis revealed that the 3' untranslated region, including the specific sequence of FGV, of the 14 isolated ALVs showed high sequence identity and a close relationship with FGV. In addition, the env gene of the isolates frequently showed mutations and deletions of nucleotides.

Defining the unique properties of the leukemic stem cells that produce the chronic phase of CML has therefore had to rely heavily on access to samples from rare patients in which the stem cell compartment is dominated by leukemic elements. Here we review past and ongoing approaches using such samples to identify biologically and clinically relevant biomarkers of BCR-ABL+ stem cells that explain their unusual biology and that may help to design, or at least predict, improved treatment responses in CML patients.

We have previously shown increased error-prone repair of DSBs by nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) in CML cells. Recent reports have identified alternative NHEJ pathways that are highly error prone, prompting us to examine the role of the alternative NHEJ pathways in BCR-ABL-positive CML. Importantly, we show that key proteins in the major NHEJ pathway, Artemis and DNA ligase IV, are down-regulated, whereas DNA ligase IIIalpha, and the protein deleted in Werner syndrome, WRN, are up-regulated. DNA ligase IIIalpha and WRN form a complex that is recruited to DSBs in CML cells. Furthermore, ""knockdown"" of either DNA ligase IIIalpha or WRN leads to increased accumulation of unrepaired DSBs, demonstrating that they contribute to the repair of DSBs. These results indicate that altered DSB repair in CML cells is caused by the increased activity of an alternative NHEJ repair pathway, involving DNA ligase IIIalpha and WRN. We suggest that, although the repair of ROS-induced DSBs by this pathway contributes to the survival of CML cells, the resultant genomic instability drives disease progression.","['Sallmyr, Annahita', 'Tomkinson, Alan E', 'Rassool, Feyruz V']","['Sallmyr A', 'Tomkinson AE', 'Rassool FV']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, Greenebaum Cancer Center, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21201, USA.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (LIG4 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Poly-ADP-Ribose Binding Proteins)', '0 (Xenopus Proteins)', 'EC 3.1.- (DCLRE1C protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.- (Endonucleases)', 'EC 3.1.- (Exodeoxyribonucleases)', 'EC 3.6.4.12 (RecQ Helicases)', 'EC 3.6.4.12 (WRN protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.4.12 (Werner Syndrome Helicase)', 'EC 6.5.1.- (DNA Ligases)', 'EC 6.5.1.1 (DNA Ligase ATP)', 'EC 6.5.1.1 (DNA ligase III alpha protein, Xenopus)']",IM,"['Cell Survival', '*DNA Breaks, Double-Stranded', 'DNA Ligase ATP', 'DNA Ligases/analysis/*physiology', '*DNA Repair', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Disease Progression', 'Endonucleases', 'Exodeoxyribonucleases/analysis/*physiology', 'Genomic Instability', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/pathology', 'Nuclear Proteins', 'Poly-ADP-Ribose Binding Proteins', 'RecQ Helicases/analysis/*physiology', '*Up-Regulation', 'Werner Syndrome Helicase', 'Xenopus Proteins']",2008/06/06 09:00,2008/09/17 09:00,['2008/06/06 09:00'],"['2008/06/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/06 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)49732-0 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2007-07-104257 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2008 Aug 15;112(4):1413-23. doi: 10.1182/blood-2007-07-104257.

Therefore, a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms that regulate MCL proliferation/survival is needed to develop an effective therapy. Because sonic hedgehog (Shh)-GLI signaling has been shown to be important in the proliferation and survival of several cancers, and no such information is available for MCL, this study was undertaken. Our results show that the molecules associated with Shh-GLI signaling, such as PTCH and SMO receptors, and GLI1 and GLI2 target transcription factors were expressed in the human MCL cell lines and primary MCL cells from patients. Perturbation of this signaling in the presence of exogenous Shh/cyclopamine significantly (P < 0.001) influenced the proliferation of JVM2 MCL cells. Furthermore, down-regulation of GLI transcription factors using antisense oligonucleotides not only resulted in significantly (P < 0.001) decreased proliferation of the MCL cells but also significantly (P < 0.05) increased their susceptibility to chemotherapeutic drug, doxorubicin. Also, down-regulation of GLI decreased cyclin D1 and BCL2 transcript levels, which suggests that these key molecules might be regulated by GLI in MCL. Thus, our results indicate a significant role for Shh-GLI signaling in the proliferation of MCL, and molecular targeting of GLI is a potential therapeutic approach to improve the treatment for MCL.","['Hegde, Ganapati V', 'Munger, Corey M', 'Emanuel, Katy', 'Joshi, Avadhut D', 'Greiner, Timothy C', 'Weisenburger, Dennis D', 'Vose, Julie M', 'Joshi, Shantaram S']","['Hegde GV', 'Munger CM', 'Emanuel K', 'Joshi AD', 'Greiner TC', 'Weisenburger DD', 'Vose JM', 'Joshi SS']","['Department of Genetics, Cell Biology, and Anatomy, Center for Research in Leukemia and Lymphoma, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE 68198-6395, USA.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,"['0 (GLI1 protein, human)', '0 (Hedgehog Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Zinc Finger Protein GLI1)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cyclin D1/genetics/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Hedgehog Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/genetics/pathology/*therapy', 'Models, Biological', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/metabolism', '*Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Zinc Finger Protein GLI1']",2008/06/06 09:00,2008/08/23 09:00,['2008/06/06 09:00'],"['2008/06/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/23 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/06 09:00 [entrez]']","['1535-7163.MCT-07-2118 [pii]', '10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-07-2118 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2008 Jun;7(6):1450-60. doi: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-07-2118.

Hyperglycemic adult ALL patients have shorter remissions, more infections, and increased mortality. No corresponding data are available in children. We hypothesized that children with ALL who become hyperglycemic during induction chemotherapy have an increased risk for infection during their first year of treatment. PROCEDURE: We conducted a retrospective chart review of 135 patients diagnosed with ALL during 1999-2001 at Texas Children's Hospital. Infectious outcomes during the first year of therapy were compared in three groups patients based on blood glucose concentrations during induction therapy: euglycemic (<140 mg/dl), mild hyperglycemic (MH) (140-199 mg/dl) and overt hyperglycemic (OH) (blood glucose >200 mg/dl). RESULTS: Seventy-five (56%) patients met criteria for either MH (21%) or OH (35%). Hyperglycemia was more prevalent in older children (P < 0.001) and those at risk for being overweight (BMI% >85%) at diagnosis (P < 0.01). Patients with MH and OH were 2.5 times (95% CI 1.0-6.2) and 2.1 times (95% CI 1.0-4.6) more likely to have documented infections, respectively. Patients with OH were 4.2 times (95% CI 1.5-12) more likely to have bacteremia/fungemia, 3.8 times (95% CI 1.2-11.6) more likely to have cellulitis, and 4.0 times (95% CI 1.7-9.3) more likely to be admitted for fever and neutropenia than the euglycemia group. CONCLUSION: Hyperglycemia, especially when overt, may be a previously unrecognized risk factor of infectious complications in children with ALL during the first year of treatment.","['Sonabend, Rona Y', 'McKay, Siripoom V', 'Okcu, M Fatih', 'Yan, Jinrong', 'Haymond, Morey W', 'Margolin, Judith F']","['Sonabend RY', 'McKay SV', 'Okcu MF', 'Yan J', 'Haymond MW', 'Margolin JF']","['Department of Pediatrics, Endocrinology and Metabolism, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, USA.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,['0 (Blood Glucose)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Blood Glucose/analysis', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hyperglycemia/*complications/etiology', 'Infections/*etiology', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications', 'Prevalence', 'Remission Induction/methods', 'Retrospective Studies']",2008/06/05 09:00,2008/08/14 09:00,['2008/06/05 09:00'],"['2008/06/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/14 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/05 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.21624 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2008 Sep;51(3):387-92. doi: 10.1002/pbc.21624.,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its impact in leukemia progression is not fully understood. We performed genomewide screening for methylated CpG islands and identified 8 genes frequently methylated in leukemia cell lines and in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML): NOR1, CDH13, p15, NPM2, OLIG2, PGR, HIN1, and SLC26A4. We assessed the methylation status of these genes and of the repetitive element LINE-1 in 30 patients with AML, both at diagnosis and relapse. Abnormal methylation was found in 23% to 83% of patients at diagnosis and in 47% to 93% at relapse, with CDH13 being the most frequently methylated. We observed concordance in methylation of several genes, confirming the presence of a hypermethylator pathway in AML. DNA methylation levels increased at relapse in 25 of 30 (83%) patients with AML. These changes represent much larger epigenetic dysregulation, since methylation microarray analysis of 9008 autosomal genes in 4 patients showed hypermethylation ranging from 5.9% to 13.6% (median 8.3%) genes at diagnosis and 8.0% to 15.2% (median 10.6%) genes in relapse (P < .001).

One method commonly used to isolate these rare cells is to sort cells stained with fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies into fractions, then transplant the different fractions into immunodeficient mice to test their repopulating ability. The antibodies are generally treated as being neutral in terms of their effects on the experiment. Human repopulating cells are thought to express CD34 and lack CD38. Here we present evidence that anti-CD38 antibodies have a profound inhibitory effect on engraftment of cord blood and leukemia cells. We show that this effect is Fc-mediated and can be overcome by treating mice with immunosuppressive antibodies. When this inhibitory effect is prevented, we demonstrate that the CD34(+)CD38(+) fraction of certain acute myeloid leukemia samples contains all, or at least most, leukemia-initiating cell capacity. This study highlights the potential pitfall of antibody-mediated clearance of repopulating cells and is important for any groups working with this model. More importantly, the work suggests that there is greater variation in the phenotypes of leukemia-initiating cells than previously suggested.","['Taussig, David C', 'Miraki-Moud, Farideh', 'Anjos-Afonso, Fernando', 'Pearce, Daniel J', 'Allen, Kirsty', 'Ridler, Christopher', 'Lillington, Debra', 'Oakervee, Heather', 'Cavenagh, Jamie', 'Agrawal, Samir G', 'Lister, T Andrew', 'Gribben, John G', 'Bonnet, Dominique']","['Taussig DC', 'Miraki-Moud F', 'Anjos-Afonso F', 'Pearce DJ', 'Allen K', 'Ridler C', 'Lillington D', 'Oakervee H', 'Cavenagh J', 'Agrawal SG', 'Lister TA', 'Gribben JG', 'Bonnet D']","[""Department of Medical Oncology, St Bartholomew's Hospital, London, UK. david.taussig@qmul.ac.uk""]",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['*ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/immunology', 'Animals', 'Antibodies/*pharmacology', 'Antigens, CD34', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cord Blood Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Fetal Blood/cytology', 'Graft Survival/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasm Transplantation']",2008/06/05 09:00,2008/09/06 09:00,['2008/06/05 09:00'],"['2008/06/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/06 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)60400-1 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2007-10-118331 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2008 Aug 1;112(3):568-75. doi: 10.1182/blood-2007-10-118331.

The multifunctional virally encoded oncoprotein Tax is responsible for malignant transformation and potent activation of HTLV-1 transcription. Tax, in complex with phosphorylated cAMP response element binding protein (pCREB), strongly recruits the cellular coactivators CREB binding protein (CBP)/p300 to the viral promoter concomitant with transcriptional activation. Although the mechanism of activator/coactivator-mediated transcriptional activation is poorly understood, the recruitment of CBP/p300 by regulatory factors appears to function, in part, by promoting changes in chromatin architecture that are permissive to transcriptional activation. Here, we show that CBP/p300 recruitment promotes histone acetylation and eviction of the histone octamer from the chromatin-assembled HTLV-1 promoter template in vitro. Nucleosome disassembly is strictly acetyl-CoA dependent and is not linked to ATP utilization. We find that the histone chaperone, nucleosome assembly protein 1 (NAP1), cooperates with CBP/p300 in eviction of the acetylated histones from the chromatin template. These findings reveal a unique mechanism in which the DNA-bound Tax/pCREB complex recruits CBP/p300, and together with NAP1, the coactivators cooperate to dramatically reduce nucleosome occupancy at the viral promoter in an acetylation-dependent and transcription-independent fashion.","['Sharma, Neelam', 'Nyborg, Jennifer K']","['Sharma N', 'Nyborg JK']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Campus Box 1870, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO 80523, USA.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Drosophila Proteins)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Molecular Chaperones)', '0 (NAP1L1 protein, human)', '0 (Nap1 protein, Drosophila)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Nucleosome Assembly Protein 1)', '0 (Nucleosomes)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '72-89-9 (Acetyl Coenzyme A)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (p300-CBP Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Acetyl Coenzyme A/pharmacology', 'Acetylation/drug effects', 'Animals', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Drosophila Proteins', 'Drosophila melanogaster/metabolism', 'Gene Products, tax/metabolism', 'Histones/*metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Models, Genetic', 'Molecular Chaperones/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Nucleosome Assembly Protein 1', 'Nucleosomes/*metabolism', 'Phosphoproteins/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/*genetics', '*Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'p300-CBP Transcription Factors/*metabolism']",2008/06/05 09:00,2008/06/28 09:00,['2008/06/05 09:00'],"['2008/06/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/28 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['0800534105 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.0800534105 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2008 Jun 10;105(23):7959-63. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0800534105.

The longer half-life of iodine-131 ((131)I)-rituximab may result in increased bone marrow exposure, with greater toxicity on repeat administration. We examined the effects of a second (131)I-rituximab in patients with indolent lymphoma following relapse. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed two institutional databases from January 2000 to July 2007 for retreatment with (131)I-rituximab. The severity of cytopenia, development of myelodysplasia (MDS), acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and hypothyroidism was noted. We compared response duration and toxicity of the treatments. RESULTS: Fourteen of 16 patients responded with nine complete responses (CRs), with a median duration of 10.5 months in responders. Six of 13 reresponders had the same or a longer response and six more remain in complete response. The median event-free survival was not significantly different for the two treatments.

METHODS: We reviewed the database of 6 consecutive Italian Association of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (AIEOP)-ALL trials conducted between 1982 and 2004. Features of DS patients were compared with those of non-DS patients. RESULTS: The 120 DS patients (1.9%) were more often girls (P = .027), aged > or = 10 years (P = .014), and high risk according to National Cancer Institute (NCI) criteria (P = .045). The distribution of white blood cell count did not differ (P = .32). DS patients belonged less frequently to the current high-risk group (P = .017). In all but 1 case they demonstrated B-cell precursor (BCP) immunophenotype (P < or = .001). TEL/AML1 molecular fusion transcript was found in only 1 of 44 (2.2%) tested patients. Induction death occurred more often in DS patients (4.2%, P = .009), but not failure to achieve remission. Leukemia relapse occurred in 31.6% of DS patients (vs 23.5%; P = .003), usually in the marrow. Remission death was more frequent in DS patients (4.2%, P = .03). Ten-year event-free survival and survival were significantly worse compared with non-DS patients (P < 0.001). DS patients diagnosed since 1995 had a better outcome (P = .06) than those diagnosed in previous years, but still had worse outcomes than non-DS patients (P = .04). Event-free survival of DS patients at NCI standard risk was lower than that of non-DS patients (P = .006). CONCLUSIONS: Presenting features of childhood ALL in DS differ from those in non-DS patients. They are almost invariably characterized by BCP phenotype, and are often TEL/AML1 negative. Treatment results, although not as good as for non-DS patients, improved progressively, with modern therapy and support allowing 75% to survive.","['Arico, Maurizio', 'Ziino, Ottavio', 'Valsecchi, Maria Grazia', 'Cazzaniga, Giovanni', 'Baronci, Carlo', 'Messina, Chiara', 'Pession, Andrea', 'Santoro, Nicola', 'Basso, Giuseppe', 'Conter, Valentino']","['Arico M', 'Ziino O', 'Valsecchi MG', 'Cazzaniga G', 'Baronci C', 'Messina C', 'Pession A', 'Santoro N', 'Basso G', 'Conter V']","['Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Children Hospital ""A.O.U.

We used an integrative genomic approach to investigate the significance of 17p loss in 18 B-CLLs in Binet stage A, carrying a TP53 monoallelic deletion detected by means of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Genome-wide DNA analysis using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays of 12 of 18 samples showed 17p loss in 11 cases, with breakpoints scattered along the 17p11.2 region. FISH analysis confirmed these findings and revealed 17p loss in a small fraction of leukemic cells in the remaining TP53-deleted case, and it also indicated 17p loss in the six cases not investigated by means of SNP arrays. Mutations in exons 2-11 of the remaining TP53 allele were found in 9 of 12 deleted samples. Gene-expression profiling of 60 B-CLLs, including seven patients with 17p loss, identified 40 differentially expressed genes in 17p- versus 17p normal samples, 35 of which were downregulated in 17p-tumors. The majority (30 of 35) of these transcripts, including putative tumor suppressor genes, mapped to 17p, thus indicating a remarkable gene-dosage effect. Our data provide evidence that 17p loss may play an additional pathogenetic role in B-CLL and suggest that the concomitant loss of multiple tumor suppressor genes could be responsible for the highly adverse prognostic relevance associated with TP53 loss.","['Fabris, Sonia', 'Mosca, Laura', 'Todoerti, Katia', 'Cutrona, Giovanna', 'Lionetti, Marta', 'Intini, Daniela', 'Matis, Serena', 'Colombo, Monica', 'Agnelli, Luca', 'Gentile, Massimo', 'Spriano, Mauro', 'Callea, Vincenzo', 'Festini, Gianluca', 'Molica, Stefano', 'Lambertenghi Deliliers, Giorgio', 'Morabito, Fortunato', 'Ferrarini, Manlio', 'Neri, Antonino']","['Fabris S', 'Mosca L', 'Todoerti K', 'Cutrona G', 'Lionetti M', 'Intini D', 'Matis S', 'Colombo M', 'Agnelli L', 'Gentile M', 'Spriano M', 'Callea V', 'Festini G', 'Molica S', 'Lambertenghi Deliliers G', 'Morabito F', 'Ferrarini M', 'Neri A']","['Centro per lo Studio delle Leucemie, Dipartimento di Scienze Mediche, Universita di Milano, U.O.

Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most frequent glioma. Its aggressive and infiltrative growth renders it extremely difficult to treat. Median survival after diagnosis is currently only 12-14 months. The present review describes the use of retroviral tagging to identify candidate cancer-causing genes that cooperate with PDGF in brain tumor formation. Newborn mice injected intracerebrally with a Moloney murine leukemia retrovirus carrying the sis/PDGF-B oncogene and a replication competent helper virus developed brain tumors with many characteristics of human gliomas. Analysis of proviral integrations in the brain tumors identified almost 70 common insertion sites (CISs). These CISs were named brain tumor loci and harbored known but also putative novel cancer-causing genes. Microarray analysis identified differentially expressed genes in the mouse brain tumors compared to normal brain. Known tumor genes and markers of immature cells were upregulated in the tumors. Tumors developed 13-42 weeks after injection and short latency tumors were further distinguished as fast growing and GBM-like. Long latency tumors resembled slow-growing oligodendrogliomas and contained significantly less integrations as compared to short latency tumors. Several candidate genes tagged in this retroviral screen have known functions in neoplastic transformation and oncogenesis. Some candidates with a previously unknown function in tumorigenesis were found and their putative role in brain tumor formation will be discussed in this review. The results show that proviral tagging may be a useful tool in the search for candidate glioma genes.","['Johansson Swartling, Fredrik']",['Johansson Swartling F'],"['Department of Genetics and Pathology, The Rudbeck Laboratory, Uppsala University, Sweden. fredrik.johansson@genpat.uu.se']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Ups J Med Sci,Upsala journal of medical sciences,0332203,['0 (Platelet-Derived Growth Factor)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Brain Neoplasms/*genetics/therapy', 'Glioma/*genetics/therapy', 'Mice', 'Platelet-Derived Growth Factor/*genetics']",2008/06/04 09:00,2008/08/12 09:00,['2008/06/04 09:00'],"['2008/06/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/12 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:pub:diva-215 [pii]', '10.3109/2000-1967-215 [doi]']",ppublish,Ups J Med Sci. 2008;113(1):1-38. doi: 10.3109/2000-1967-215.,1,240,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis of ALA showed homology at 15, 19-21, 24-27, and 29 residues with other lectin members of Moraceae family viz., Artocarpus integrifolia (jacalin) lectin, Artocarpus hirsuta lectin, and Maclura pomifera agglutinin.

Patients with a poor prednisone response (PPR) have a poor event-free survival as compared to those with a good prednisone response (PGR). Causes of prednisone resistance are still not well understood. We hypothesized that GC resistance is an intrinsic feature of ALL cells which is reflected in the gene expression pattern and analyzed genome-wide gene expression using microarrays. A case-control study was performed comparing gene expression profiles from initial ALL samples of 20 patients with PPR and those of 20 patients with PGR. Differential gene expression of a subset of genes was confirmed by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis and validation was performed in a second independent patient sample (n=20). We identified 121 genes that clearly distinguished prednisone-resistant from sensitive ALL samples (FDR<5%, fold change>or=1.5). Differential gene expression of 21 of these genes could be validated in a second independent set. Of importance, there was a remarkable concordance of genes identified by comparing expression signatures of PPR and PGR cells at diagnosis and those previously described to be up- or downregulated in leukemic cells persisting under GC treatment. Thus, GC resistance seems at least in part to be an intrinsic feature of leukemic cells. Leukemic cells of patients with PPR are characterized by gene expression pattern which are similar to those of resistant cells persisting under glucocorticoid treatment.","['Cario, Gunnar', 'Fetz, Andrea', 'Bretscher, Christian', 'Moricke, Anja', 'Schrauder, Andre', 'Stanulla, Martin', 'Schrappe, Martin']","['Cario G', 'Fetz A', 'Bretscher C', 'Moricke A', 'Schrauder A', 'Stanulla M', 'Schrappe M']","['Department of Pediatrics, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Campus Kiel, Schwanenweg 20, 24105 Kiel, Germany. g.cario@pediatrics.uni-kiel.de']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)', 'PVDA protocol']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols', 'Asparaginase', 'Blast Crisis', 'Child', 'Daunorubicin', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'Prednisone/*therapeutic use', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Vincristine']",2008/06/04 09:00,2008/09/26 09:00,['2008/06/04 09:00'],"['2007/11/02 00:00 [received]', '2008/04/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/06/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/26 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/04 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00277-008-0504-x [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2008 Sep;87(9):709-16. doi: 10.1007/s00277-008-0504-x.

However, the mechanisms that link these malignancies to activated coagulation have not been fully identified. Since anti-haemostatic agents are studied in clinical trials for their potential to prolong survival in cancer patients, a detailed characterisation of haemostatic markers in cancer subtypes is needed. Hence, in this study, we measured the plasma concentrations and mRNA expression in blood mononuclear cells of haemostatic parameters in 93 patients with haematological neoplasias (acute myeloid leukaemia, chronic lymphatic leukaemia, multiple myeloma, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma) before start and after completion of cancer therapy. At diagnosis we found activation of coagulation and fibrinolysis, especially in patients with acute myeloid leukaemia. This hypercoagulation was not associated with increased levels of tissue factor (TF) or factor VII (fVII) antigen or mRNA, or levels of activated fVII. In conclusion we found a hypercoagulable state in patients with haematological malignancy that did not seem to be initiated by TF.","['Negaard, Helene F S', 'Iversen, Per Ole', 'Ostenstad, Bjorn', 'Iversen, Nina', 'Holme, Pal A', 'Sandset, Per Morten']","['Negaard HF', 'Iversen PO', 'Ostenstad B', 'Iversen N', 'Holme PA', 'Sandset PM']","['Department of Haematology, Ulleval University Hospital Trust, Oslo, Norway.

In this process, tissue oxygen concentration is well known to determine capillary density via the hypoxia-induced cascade, in which HIFs and VEGF play key roles. However, some additional mechanisms modulating this cascade are suggested to be involved in precise capillary network formation. Here, we showed that leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) was predominantly expressed in developing endothelium, while its receptor was expressed in surrounding cells such as retinal astrocytes. The retinas of Lif(-/-) mice displayed increased microvessel density accompanied by sustained tip cell activity, due to increased VEGF expression by astrocytes in the vascularized area. Lif(-/-) mice resisted hyperoxygen insult in the oxygen-induced retinopathy model, whereas they paradoxically had increased numbers of neovascular tufts. In an in vitro study, LIF inhibited hypoxia-induced VEGF expression and proliferation in cultured astrocytes. Lif(-/-) mice also exhibited similarly increased microvessel density and upregulated VEGF in various tissues outside the retina. Together, these findings suggest that tissues and advancing vasculature communicate to ensure adequate vascularization using LIF as well as oxygen, which suggests a new strategy for antiangiogenic therapy in human diseases such as diabetic retinopathy and cancer.","['Kubota, Yoshiaki', 'Hirashima, Masanori', 'Kishi, Kazuo', 'Stewart, Colin L', 'Suda, Toshio']","['Kubota Y', 'Hirashima M', 'Kishi K', 'Stewart CL', 'Suda T']","['Department of Cell Differentiation, Sakaguchi Laboratory, School of Medicine, Keio University, Tokyo, Japan. ykubo33@sc.itc.keio.ac.jp']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein)', '0 (Hif1a protein, mouse)', '0 (Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lifr protein, mouse)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '0 (glial fibrillary astrocytic protein, mouse)', '0 (vascular endothelial growth factor A, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Jak2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)', 'S88TT14065 (Oxygen)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Astrocytes/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Endothelial Cells/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Endothelium, Vascular/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein', 'Hypoxia/metabolism', 'Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit/metabolism', 'Janus Kinase 2/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/genetics/pharmacology/*physiology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Models, Biological', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic/metabolism/pathology', 'Neovascularization, Physiologic/drug effects/*physiology', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/metabolism', 'Oxygen/pharmacology/*physiology', 'Retina/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism']",2008/06/04 09:00,2008/09/26 09:00,['2008/06/04 09:00'],"['2007/12/26 00:00 [received]', '2008/04/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/06/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/26 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/04 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1172/JCI34882 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Invest. 2008 Jul;118(7):2393-403. doi: 10.1172/JCI34882.,7,,,,,PMC2398738,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

R, S-HZ08 and their racemate also moderately reversed the resistance to adriamycin and vincristine of MCF-7/ADM cells that overexpress MRP1. However, R, S-HZ08 and their racemate hardly affected intracellular glutathione (GSH) levels and glutathione S-transferase (GST) activities in MCF-7/ADM cells.

To date, most of the available data come from a single multicenter study in which some of the patients were censored for diverse reasons. Here, we report our experience in treating patients at a single institution in a setting where all events were recorded. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 204 consecutive adult patients with newly diagnosed CML in CP received imatinib from June 2000 until August 2006. Response (hematologic, cytogenetic, and molecular), progression-free survival (PFS) and survival were evaluated. RESULTS: At 5 years, cumulative incidences of complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) and major molecular response (MMR) were 82.7% and 50.1%, respectively. Estimated overall survival and PFS were 83.2% and 82.7%, respectively. By 5 years, 25% of patients had discontinued imatinib treatment because of an unsatisfactory response and/or toxicity. The 5-year probability of remaining in major cytogenetic response while still receiving imatinib was 62.7%. Patients achieving a CCyR at 1 year had a better PFS and overall survival than those failing to reach CCyR, but achieving a MMR conferred no further advantage. The identification of a kinase domain mutation was the only factor predicting for loss of CCyR. CONCLUSION: Imatinib is highly effective in most patients with CML-CP; patients who respond are likely to live substantially longer than those treated with earlier therapies. Achieving CCyR correlated with PFS and overall survival, but achieving MMR had no further predictive value. However, approximately one third of patients still need better therapy.","['de Lavallade, Hugues', 'Apperley, Jane F', 'Khorashad, Jamshid S', 'Milojkovic, Dragana', 'Reid, Alistair G', 'Bua, Marco', 'Szydlo, Richard', 'Olavarria, Eduardo', 'Kaeda, Jaspal', 'Goldman, John M', 'Marin, David']","['de Lavallade H', 'Apperley JF', 'Khorashad JS', 'Milojkovic D', 'Reid AG', 'Bua M', 'Szydlo R', 'Olavarria E', 'Kaeda J', 'Goldman JM', 'Marin D']","['Department of Haematology, Imperial College London, Du Cane Rd, London W12 0NN, United Kingdom.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Benzamides', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*pathology', 'Cohort Studies', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*diagnosis/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperazines/*administration & dosage', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Pyrimidines/*administration & dosage', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Assessment', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Statistics, Nonparametric', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome']",2008/06/04 09:00,2008/08/14 09:00,['2008/06/04 09:00'],"['2008/06/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/14 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['JCO.2007.15.8154 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2007.15.8154 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2008 Jul 10;26(20):3358-63. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2007.15.8154.

Yet, in CLL, both homotypic and heterotypic CD31-CD38 interactions are expected to be rather ubiquitous. We analyzed whether CD38-CD31 interactions result in proliferative and antiapoptotic signals. We found a high expression of CD31 on CLL, irrespective of CD38 expression. Coculture of CD38(high) CLL with endothelial cells or CD31 transfected fibroblasts, with or without blocking CD31 or CD38 antibodies, did not result in increased survival or proliferation. Analysis of gene expression of most known regulators of apoptosis revealed no influence of coculture with CD31-expressing feeder cells. In conclusion, our data do not support an important contribution of CD38 triggering by CD31 to the proliferative and antiapoptotic state of the leukemic clone.","['Tonino, Sanne H', 'Spijker, Rene', 'Luijks, Dieuwertje M P', 'van Oers, Marinus H J', 'Kater, Arnon P']","['Tonino SH', 'Spijker R', 'Luijks DM', 'van Oers MH', 'Kater AP']","['Department of Hematology, Academic Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands. s.h.tonino@amc.uva.nl']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Platelet Endothelial Cell Adhesion Molecule-1)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Endothelial Cells/cytology', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*etiology/pathology', 'Platelet Endothelial Cell Adhesion Molecule-1/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2008/06/04 09:00,2008/09/06 09:00,['2008/06/04 09:00'],"['2008/06/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/06 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)60431-1 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2008-03-144576 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2008 Aug 1;112(3):840-3. doi: 10.1182/blood-2008-03-144576.

Sixty-seven patients with HLA-matched sibling donors received fractionated total body irradiation (FTBI) and high-dose VP16, whereas 11 patients received FTBI/VP16/cyclophosphamide, and 1 patient received FTBI/VP16/busulfan. The median age was 36 years. At the time of HCT, 49 patients (62%) were in first complete remission (CR1) and 30 patients (38%) were beyond CR1 (> CR1). The median follow-up was 75 months (range, 14-245 months). The 10-year overall survival for the CR1 and beyond CR1 patients was 54% and 29% (P = .01), respectively, and event-free survival was 48% and 26% (P = .02), respectively. There was no significant difference in relapse incidence (28% vs 41%, P = .28), but nonrelapse mortality was significantly higher in the beyond CR1 patients, (31% vs 54%, P = .03, respectively). By univariate analysis, factors affecting event-free and overall survival were white blood cell count at diagnosis (< 30 x 10(9)/L vs > 30 x 10(9)/L) and disease status (CR1 vs > CR1). The median time to relapse for CR1 and for beyond CR1 patients was 12 months and 9 months, respectively.

Through a compound library screen, 6-benzylthioinosine (6BT) was identified as a promising differentiation-inducing agent. 6BT induces monocytic differentiation of myeloid leukemia cell lines such as HL-60 and OCI-AML3, as well as primary patient samples as evidenced by morphology, immunophenotyping, and nitroblue tetrazolium reduction. Not only can 6BT induce differentiation but a subset of AML cell lines such as MV4-11 and HNT34 instead undergo 6BT-mediated cell death. Despite inducing cell death in some leukemic cells, 6BT exhibits extremely low toxicity on several nonmalignant cells such as fibroblasts, normal bone marrow, and endothelial cells. This toxicity profile may relate to the function of 6BT as an inhibitor of the nucleoside transporter, ent1, which is thought to prevent it from entering many cell types. In contrast, 6BT likely enters at least some leukemic cell lines as shown by its requirement for phosphorylation for its differentiation activity. 6BT is also able to synergize with currently used myeloid differentiation agents such as ATRA and decitabine. Early studies indicate that the mechanism of action of this compound may involve ATP depletion that leads to growth inhibition and subsequent differentiation. Besides in vitro activity, 6BT also shows the ability to impair HL-60 and MV4-11 tumor growth in nude mice. 6BT is a promising new monocytic differentiation agent with apparent leukemic cell-specific activity.","['Wald, David N', 'Vermaat, Hanna M', 'Zang, Shaolei', 'Lavik, Andrew', 'Kang, Zizhen', 'Peleg, Gil', 'Gerson, Stanton L', 'Bunting, Kevin D', 'Agarwal, Munna L', 'Roth, Bryan L', 'Tse, William']","['Wald DN', 'Vermaat HM', 'Zang S', 'Lavik A', 'Kang Z', 'Peleg G', 'Gerson SL', 'Bunting KD', 'Agarwal ML', 'Roth BL', 'Tse W']","['Department of Pathology, Case Western Reserve School of Medicine, Cleveland, Ohio 44106, USA. dnw@case.edu']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (6-benzylthioinosine)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '46S541971T (Thioinosine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Primers', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Phosphorylation', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Thioinosine/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Transplantation, Heterologous']",2008/06/04 09:00,2008/08/16 09:00,['2008/06/04 09:00'],"['2008/06/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/16 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['68/11/4369 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-6559 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2008 Jun 1;68(11):4369-76. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-6559.,11,,,"['K12 CA076917/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA043703/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA098916/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA98916/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC3896053,['NIHMS502107'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

They vary substantially in their natural history and show important clinical differences from their adult counterparts. To address the biological basis for these observations, we have undertaken a comprehensive analysis of global gene expression patterns in pediatric malignant GCTs and compared these findings with published data on adult testicular GCTs (TGCT). Our study included 27 primary tumors and assessed the principal malignant histologic types of pediatric GCT, yolk sac tumor (YST; n = 18), and seminoma (n = 9). Analysis of Affymetrix U133A GeneChip data was performed using the statistical software environment R, including gene set enrichment analysis, with cross-validation at the RNA and protein level. Unsupervised analysis showed complete separation of YSTs and seminomas by global gene expression profiles and identified a robust set of 657 discriminatory transcripts. There was no segregation of tumors of the same histology arising at different sites or at different ages within the pediatric range. In contrast, there was segregation of pediatric malignant GCTs and adult malignant TGCTs, most notably for the YSTs. The pediatric seminomas were significantly enriched for genes associated with the self-renewing pluripotent phenotype, whereas the pediatric YSTs were significantly enriched for genes associated with a differentiation and proliferation phenotype. We conclude that histologic type is the key discriminator in pediatric malignant GCTs and that the observed clinical differences between malignant GCTs of children and adults are mirrored by significant differences in global gene expression.","['Palmer, Roger D', 'Barbosa-Morais, Nuno L', 'Gooding, Emma L', 'Muralidhar, Balaji', 'Thornton, Claire M', 'Pett, Mark R', 'Roberts, Ian', 'Schneider, Dominik T', 'Thorne, Natalie', 'Tavare, Simon', 'Nicholson, James C', 'Coleman, Nicholas']","['Palmer RD', 'Barbosa-Morais NL', 'Gooding EL', 'Muralidhar B', 'Thornton CM', 'Pett MR', 'Roberts I', 'Schneider DT', 'Thorne N', 'Tavare S', 'Nicholson JC', 'Coleman N']","['MRC Cancer Cell Unit, Hutchison/MRC Research Center, Cambridge, United Kingdom. rdp@hutchison-mrc.cam.ac.uk']","[""Children's Cancer and Leukaemia Group""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Endodermal Sinus Tumor/*genetics/pathology', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Neoplasms, Germ Cell and Embryonal/*genetics/pathology', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'RNA, Messenger/*genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Seminoma/*genetics/pathology']",2008/06/04 09:00,2008/08/16 09:00,['2008/06/04 09:00'],"['2008/06/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/16 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['68/11/4239 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-5560 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2008 Jun 1;68(11):4239-47. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-5560.,11,,,"['MC_U105359875/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'CRUK_/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom']",,,,,,['GEO/GSE10615'],,,,,,,,,,

Promoter CpG island hypermethylation of differentiating genes, however, has rarely been reported. The Groucho homologue Transducin-like Enhancer of Split 1 (TLE1) is a multitasked transcriptional corepressor that acts through the acute myelogenous leukemia 1, Wnt, and Notch signaling pathways. We have found that TLE1 undergoes promoter CpG island hypermethylation-associated inactivation in hematologic malignancies, such as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and AML. We also observed a mutual exclusivity of the epigenetic alteration of TLE1 and the cytogenetic alteration of AML1. TLE1 reintroduction in hypermethylated leukemia/lymphoma cells causes growth inhibition in colony assays and nude mice, whereas TLE1-short hairpin RNA depletion in unmethylated cells enhances tumor growth. We also show that these effects are mediated by TLE1 transcriptional repressor activity on its target genes, such as Cyclin D1, Colony-Stimulating Factor 1 receptor, and Hairy/Enhancer of Split 1. These data suggest that TLE1 epigenetic inactivation contributes to the development of hematologic malignancies by disrupting critical differentiation and growth-suppressing pathways.","['Fraga, Mario F', 'Berdasco, Maria', 'Ballestar, Esteban', 'Ropero, Santiago', 'Lopez-Nieva, Pilar', 'Lopez-Serra, Lidia', 'Martin-Subero, Jose I', 'Calasanz, Maria J', 'Lopez de Silanes, Isabel', 'Setien, Fernando', 'Casado, Sara', 'Fernandez, Agustin F', 'Siebert, Reiner', 'Stifani, Stefano', 'Esteller, Manel']","['Fraga MF', 'Berdasco M', 'Ballestar E', 'Ropero S', 'Lopez-Nieva P', 'Lopez-Serra L', 'Martin-Subero JI', 'Calasanz MJ', 'Lopez de Silanes I', 'Setien F', 'Casado S', 'Fernandez AF', 'Siebert R', 'Stifani S', 'Esteller M']","['Cancer Epigenetics Laboratory, Spanish National Cancer Research Centre, Madrid, Spain.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Co-Repressor Proteins)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (TLE1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Co-Repressor Proteins', 'CpG Islands', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Primers', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Repressor Proteins/*genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2008/06/04 09:00,2008/08/16 09:00,['2008/06/04 09:00'],"['2008/06/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/16 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['68/11/4116 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-0085 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2008 Jun 1;68(11):4116-22. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-0085.,11,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Support for the cancer stem cell model has been stimulated by experiments in which human tumor cells were transplanted into immunodeficient mice. Most notably, in human acute myeloid leukemia, only a minute proportion of the cells, displaying a defined phenotype, could seed leukemia in mice. Xenotransplantation, however, may fail to reveal many tumor growth-sustaining cells because the foreign microenvironment precludes essential interactions with support cells. In studies that instead have transplanted mouse leukemias and lymphomas into syngeneic animals, most of the tumors seem to be maintained by the dominant cell population, and only a few types of mouse leukemia seem to be sustained by a minor tumor growth-sustaining subpopulation. The collective evidence suggests that various tumors may span the spectrum between the extremes represented by the two models.

We evaluated the significance of the complete clearance of peripheral leukemic blasts on survival in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. DESIGN AND METHODS: Seven hundred and fifty-four children diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, consecutively enrolled from 1999 to 2003 in the TCCSG L99-15 study, were eligible for analysis. Patients were stratified into three risk groups based on presenting features, such as age and the leukocyte count before starting the treatment, followed by reclassification into three categories 7 days after prednisolone monotherapy based on the peripheral blast count; 0/microL (Day8NoBlasts), 1-999/microL and >or= 1,000/microL. RESULTS: After 7 days of prednisolone monotherapy, 249 patients (33%) were classified as Day8NoBlasts, 392 patients (52%) had blast counts of 1-999/microL, and 113 patients (15%) had blast counts >or= 1,000/microL. The event-free survival for all patients was 79.6+/-1.6 (SE)% at 4 years, whereas that for patients with Day8NoBlasts was 90.4+/-2.0% (n=249) and the event-free survival for the other patients was 74.2+/-2.2% (n=504) (log rank p<0.001). The event-free survival for Day8NoBlasts patients with B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia and T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia was 89.8+/-2.1% (n=226) and 95.7+/-4.3% (n=23), respectively. In a multivariate analysis, age at diagnosis, the initial white blood cell count, immunophenotype, and gender did not remain as independent risk factors for treatment failure, whereas Day8NoBlasts and marked hyperdiploidy (more than 50 chromosomes) became statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Children with Day8NoBlasts constituted one third of all the cases with childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia with an excellent outcome, and should be candidates for curative management with less intensive treatment.","['Manabe, Atsushi', 'Ohara, Akira', 'Hasegawa, Daisuke', 'Koh, Katsuyoshi', 'Saito, Tomohiro', 'Kiyokawa, Nobutaka', 'Kikuchi, Akira', 'Takahashi, Hiroyuki', 'Ikuta, Koichiro', 'Hayashi, Yasuhide', 'Hanada, Ryoji', 'Tsuchida, Masahiro']","['Manabe A', 'Ohara A', 'Hasegawa D', 'Koh K', 'Saito T', 'Kiyokawa N', 'Kikuchi A', 'Takahashi H', 'Ikuta K', 'Hayashi Y', 'Hanada R', 'Tsuchida M']","[""Department of Pediatrics, St. Luke's International Hospital, 9-1, Akashi-cho, Chuo-ku, Tokyo 104-8560, Japan. manabe-luke@umin.ac.jp""]","[""Tokyo Children's Cancer Study Group""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal)', '9PHQ9Y1OLM (Prednisolone)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Blast Crisis/*drug therapy', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/classification/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Prednisolone/*therapeutic use', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Tokyo']",2008/06/04 09:00,2008/10/10 09:00,['2008/06/04 09:00'],"['2008/06/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/10 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.12365 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.12365 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2008 Aug;93(8):1155-60. doi: 10.3324/haematol.12365.

Both chronic myeloid leukemia and gastrointestinal stromal tumor patients developed a significant reduction of gammaglobulin and immunoglobulin serum levels. No significant hypogammaglobulinemia was observed in chronic myeloid leukemia patients in the pre-imatinib era.

We sought to evaluate the effects of this drug on cell proliferation, centrosomes, mitotic spindles, and cell cycle progression in vitro and in vivo. DESIGN AND METHODS: Human dermal fibroblasts, Chinese hamster cells, human osteosarcoma cells, and blood and bone marrow mononuclear cells from 32 patients with chronic myeloid leukemia, gastrointestinal stromal tumor, and systemic mastocytosis as well as from six healthy individuals were investigated. The effects of dasatinib were compared with those of the ABL inhibitors imatinib and nilotinib, the SRC inhibitor PP2, and the ABL/LYN inhibitor INNO-406. RESULTS: Dasatinib induced G(1) phase arrest in all cell lines and this was associated with a decline in cyclin D1 levels. In vitro, centrosomal aberrations, a decrease of mitotic spindles, and G(1) phase arrest were observed. In patients, centrosome alterations were found in a median of 17% (range, 10-22%) of cells with a decrease of spindles in 8/18 patients. In comparison, imatinib, nilotinib and PP2 led to centrosome aberrations without G(1) phase arrest. INNO-406 was associated with centrosome aberrations and cell cycle arrest in G(1) phase. CONCLUSIONS: Dasatinib blocks the G(1)/S transition and inhibits cell growth. It induces centrosomal aberrations and a decrease of mitotic spindles. The effects suggest an involvement of SRC and ABL inhibition.","['Fabarius, Alice', 'Giehl, Michelle', 'Rebacz, Blanka', 'Kramer, Alwin', 'Frank, Oliver', 'Haferlach, Claudia', 'Duesberg, Peter', 'Hehlmann, Rudiger', 'Seifarth, Wolfgang', 'Hochhaus, Andreas']","['Fabarius A', 'Giehl M', 'Rebacz B', 'Kramer A', 'Frank O', 'Haferlach C', 'Duesberg P', 'Hehlmann R', 'Seifarth W', 'Hochhaus A']","['III.

METHODS: We conducted a nationwide and population based cohort study including 44,905 persons aged 30-60 years diagnosed with selected cancers in the period 1981-2000 and 211,562 randomly sampled cancer-free controls. Information on socioeconomic status, demography and physical and psychiatric comorbidity was obtained from Danish administrative registries. RESULTS: We analyzed the risk for ERP adjusted for known risk factors and found that cancer patients has an excess risk of ERP compared to cancer-free controls (RR, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.55-1.65 and RR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.46-1.65 for women and men, respectively). The observed risk factors for taking ERP were late age, dissimilated disease, manual job, sickness leave the year before taking ERP, physical and psychological comorbidity, low education and low income. Three risk categories were identified (high, medium and low) by cancer site and we found that in the high risk category, people diagnosed with leukemia, prostate cancer or ovary cancer had a more than two-fold increased risk for ERP and the risk remained increased with up to 8 years of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: We observed a significantly increased risk for taking early retirement up to 8 years after the cancer diagnosis and that the magnitude of the risk was dependent of cancer sites.","['Carlsen, Kathrine', 'Oksbjerg Dalton, Susanne', 'Frederiksen, Kirsten', 'Diderichsen, Finn', 'Johansen, Christoffer']","['Carlsen K', 'Oksbjerg Dalton S', 'Frederiksen K', 'Diderichsen F', 'Johansen C']","['Department of Psychosocial Cancer Research, Institute of Cancer Epidemiology, Danish Cancer Society, Copenhagen, Denmark. kathcarl@cancer.dk']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Sweden,Scand J Public Health,Scandinavian journal of public health,100883503,,IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Cohort Studies', 'Comorbidity', 'Denmark/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Neoplasms/complications/mortality/psychology', 'Pensions/statistics & numerical data', '*Retirement/economics/statistics & numerical data', 'Risk Factors', 'Sex Factors', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Survivors/psychology/statistics & numerical data', 'Time Factors']",2008/06/04 09:00,2008/06/06 09:00,['2008/06/04 09:00'],"['2008/06/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/06 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['36/2/117 [pii]', '10.1177/1403494807085192 [doi]']",ppublish,Scand J Public Health. 2008 Mar;36(2):117-25. doi: 10.1177/1403494807085192.,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One yr after HSCT, the mean serum ferritin level was 1158 ng/mL (range, 22-3264 ng/mL), with 124 patients (93.2%) having a serum ferritin level that exceeded the upper limit of the normal range (110 ng/mL). Thereafter, the serum ferritin level declined over time. There was a positive correlation between the level of serum ferritin and that of total bilirubin (r = 0.21, p < 0.001) and glutamate pyruvate transaminase (r = 0.17, p < 0.001). A high concentration of serum ferritin was associated with low cardiac fractional shortening (r = -0.15, p = 0.047). In addition, patients with hypothyroidism and GH deficiency had a higher level of serum ferritin than those without (p < 0.02). We conclude that iron overload is common after HSCT and is associated with hepatic, cardiac, and endocrine dysfunction.","['Chotsampancharoen, Thirachit', 'Gan, Kwan', 'Kasow, Kimberly A', 'Barfield, Raymond C', 'Hale, Gregory A', 'Leung, Wing']","['Chotsampancharoen T', 'Gan K', 'Kasow KA', 'Barfield RC', 'Hale GA', 'Leung W']","[""Division of Bone Marrow Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA.""]",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",Denmark,Pediatr Transplant,Pediatric transplantation,9802574,['9007-73-2 (Ferritins)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Endocrine System Diseases/etiology', 'Female', 'Ferritins/blood', 'Heart Diseases/etiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Iron Overload/blood/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Liver Diseases/etiology', 'Male', 'Risk Factors', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Young Adult']",2008/06/04 09:00,2009/08/07 09:00,['2008/06/04 09:00'],"['2008/06/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/07 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['PTR983 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1399-3046.2008.00983.x [doi]']",ppublish,Pediatr Transplant. 2009 May;13(3):348-52. doi: 10.1111/j.1399-3046.2008.00983.x.

It has also been shown that the rate of second cancers is increased in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to review the immune alterations in untreated and treated chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and define their impact for clinical practice. METHODS: The author gives a comprehensive review of the most relevant preclinical and clinical studies pertaining to various immune abnormalities and infectious complications in both untreated and treated chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. Landmark clinical trials involving the contemporary chronic lymphocytic leukaemia chemo- and immunotherapies, alone or in combination, as well as the main epidemiological studies establishing the increased rate of second cancers in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia are also discussed. RESULTS/CONCLUSIONS: Iatrogenic immunosuppression in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia alters the pattern of opportunistic infections, can cause autoimmune cytopenias and might further increase the rate of second malignancies in patients whose disease already places them at a greater risk. Careful consideration of existing risk factors in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia could establish the optimal screening and follow-up schedule for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia patients as its therapeutics evolves.","['Dasanu, Constantin A']",['Dasanu CA'],"['Seattle Hematology-Oncology, 2202 70th Ave West, University Place, WA 98466, USA. c_dasanu@yahoo.com']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Expert Opin Pharmacother,Expert opinion on pharmacotherapy,100897346,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['*Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Immune System Diseases/*chemically induced', 'Immune Tolerance/*drug effects', '*Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/immunology', '*Neoplasms, Second Primary/chemically induced/epidemiology/immunology', '*Opportunistic Infections/etiology/immunology']",2008/06/04 09:00,2008/07/11 09:00,['2008/06/04 09:00'],"['2008/06/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/11 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/04 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1517/14656566.9.9.1481 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Pharmacother. 2008 Jun;9(9):1481-94. doi: 10.1517/14656566.9.9.1481.,9,69,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most cases of CML diagnosed and treated in chronic phase are extremely well controlled with imatinib monotherapy, and primary resistance is very uncommon. Even though the treatment failure rate is low, the emergence of drug resistance and the lack of eradication of the hematopoietic stem cell clone has prompted a wave of drugs to address one or both these problems. Several clinical trials (Phase I and II) of dasatinib or nilotinib in the treatment of imatinib-resistant or -intolerant Ph chromosome-positive leukemia have already reported a remarkable rate of hematologic response greater than 90% for chronic-phase patients. These drugs minimize the risk of acquired drug resistance that is particularly seen within the first 24-36 months of therapy, and can prevent early failure in these patients, Furthermore, rational, noncross-resistant combinations that include a T315I inhibitor and drugs that can eradicate the hematopoietic stem cell clone may extend the coverage to virtually all patients with bcr-abl. Here we review the 6-year impact of the 'magic pill', Gleevec, (Glivec), including the emerging problems with its treatment, the efficacy data of dasatinib and nilotinib and the very promising data of the newer generation of drugs for CML.","['Padmanabhan, Swami', 'Ravella, Saritha', 'Curiel, Tyler', 'Giles, Francis']","['Padmanabhan S', 'Ravella S', 'Curiel T', 'Giles F']","['Department of Hematology/Oncology, Institute for Drug Development, Cancer Therapy and Research Center, San Antonio, TX, USA.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Future Oncol,"Future oncology (London, England)",101256629,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Drug Design', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy']",2008/06/04 09:00,2008/08/08 09:00,['2008/06/04 09:00'],"['2008/06/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/08 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/04 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.2217/14796694.4.3.359 [doi]'],ppublish,Future Oncol. 2008 Jun;4(3):359-77. doi: 10.2217/14796694.4.3.359.,3,77,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The pathomechanisms causing primary MDS require further work. Development and progression of MDS is suggested to be a multistep alteration to hematopoietic stem cells. Different molecular alterations have been described, affecting genes involved in cell-cycle control, mitotic checkpoints, and growth factor receptors. Secondary signal proteins and transcription factors, which gives the cell a growth advantage over its normal counterpart, may be affected as well.

Further advances in the treatment of T-cell leukemia will require the development of novel agents that can target specific malignancies without a significant increase in toxicity. Nelarabine (2-amino-9beta-D-arabinosyl-6-methoxy-9H-guanine), a synthesized guanosine nucleoside prodrug of ara-G (9-beta-D-arabinofuranosylguanine), recently received accelerated approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of relapsed/refractory T-ALL and T-LBL in adults and children. Nelarabine is water soluble and rapidly converted to ara-G, which is specifically cytotoxic to T-lymphocytes and T-lymphoblastoid cells.

We hypothesised that altered secretion of adiponectin and resistin may underlie this association. We thus investigated the role of both total and high molecular weight (HMW) adiponectin and resistin in MDS. METHODS: In a case-control study, we studied 101 cases with incident, histologically confirmed primary MDS and 101 controls matched on gender and age between 2004 and 2007. Total and HMW adiponectin, resistin, insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) and insulin-like growth factor binding protein (IGFBP-3) were determined. RESULTS: Lower serum total or HMW adiponectin and/or resistin levels were independently associated with higher risk of MDS controlling for age, gender, BMI and serum levels of leptin, IGF-I and IGFBP-3 (p<0.002). Although total and HMW adiponectin were both significantly inversely associated with MDS when modelled either in quartiles or continuously, HMW did not offer any substantial additional predictive value over total adiponectin (Odds ratio (OR)=0.91 versus 0.93 for a 1 microg/ml change, respectively). IGF-I was positively associated with MDS by bivariate analysis and both IGF-I and IGFBP-3 were higher in advanced MDS and higher risk stages, but were not significantly and independently associated with MDS. CONCLUSION: Total and HMW adiponectin may have a protective role in MDS, whereas resistin levels may be decreased via a compensatory mechanism.","['Dalamaga, Maria', 'Karmaniolas, Konstantinos', 'Nikolaidou, Athina', 'Chamberland, John', 'Hsi, Alex', 'Dionyssiou-Asteriou, Amalia', 'Mantzoros, Christos S']","['Dalamaga M', 'Karmaniolas K', 'Nikolaidou A', 'Chamberland J', 'Hsi A', 'Dionyssiou-Asteriou A', 'Mantzoros CS']","['Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Medical School, University of Athens, Attikon General University Hospital, Chaidari, Athens, Greece.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Cancer,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",9005373,"['0 (Adiponectin)', '0 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Proteins)', '0 (Resistin)', '67763-96-6 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor I)']",IM,"['Adiponectin/*blood', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Body Mass Index', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Proteins/blood', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor I/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*blood/prevention & control', 'Obesity/blood', 'Odds Ratio', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Resistin/*blood', 'Risk Factors', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",2008/06/03 09:00,2008/10/14 09:00,['2008/06/03 09:00'],"['2008/03/18 00:00 [received]', '2008/04/23 00:00 [revised]', '2008/04/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/06/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/14 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0959-8049(08)00340-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ejca.2008.04.015 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Cancer. 2008 Aug;44(12):1744-53. doi: 10.1016/j.ejca.2008.04.015.,12,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Second-generation Bcr-Abl inhibitors are capable to overcome resistance mediated by most mutations except T315I. As this mutation is causative for approximately 20% of clinically observed resistances, the need for novel treatment strategies becomes obvious. Here, we report on a novel kinase inhibitor PHA-680626 exhibiting strong inhibitory activity on both Bcr-Abl and Aurora kinases. Significant anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects were observed in human BCR-ABL positive cell lines and murine BaF3 cells ectopically expressing wt BCR-ABL or the Imatinib-resistant BCR-ABL mutants M351T, E255K and, T315I. Treatment with PHA-680626 decreased phosphorylation of CrkL and histone H3. As CrkL represents a typical downstream target of Bcr-Abl while histone H3 phosphorylation is an indicator for Aurora kinase B activity, these findings indicate that effects of PHA-680626 are mediated via inhibition of both pathways. Moreover, high anti-proliferative activity of PHA-680626 was observed in primary CD34+ cells derived from CML patients at diagnosis or in blast crisis as well as from an individual harbouring the T315I mutation. Thus, both Bcr-Abl and Aurora kinase inhibition contribute to the efficacy of PHA-680626 against Imatinib-resistant BCR-ABL positive leukemias, particularly those harbouring the T315I mutation.","['Gontarewicz, Artur', 'Balabanov, Stefan', 'Keller, Gunhild', 'Panse, Jens', 'Schafhausen, Philippe', 'Bokemeyer, Carsten', 'Fiedler, Walter', 'Moll, Jurgen', 'Brummendorf, Tim H']","['Gontarewicz A', 'Balabanov S', 'Keller G', 'Panse J', 'Schafhausen P', 'Bokemeyer C', 'Fiedler W', 'Moll J', 'Brummendorf TH']","['Onkologisches Zentrum, Universitats-Klinikum Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (PHA 680626)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Pyrroles)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (AURKB protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Aurora Kinase B)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Aurora Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/drug effects', 'Antigens, CD34/*drug effects', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Aurora Kinase B', 'Aurora Kinases', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Division/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/enzymology/*pathology', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrazoles/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Pyrroles/*pharmacology']",2008/06/03 09:00,2009/01/10 09:00,['2008/06/03 09:00'],"['2008/01/15 00:00 [received]', '2008/04/04 00:00 [revised]', '2008/04/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/06/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/10 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0145-2126(08)00209-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2008.04.012 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2008 Dec;32(12):1857-65. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2008.04.012.

It can also be found in meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials. However, though readers are able to recalculate examples from hypothetical as well as real data, they may have problems to easily figure where it emerges from. METHOD: First, two kinds of plots are proposed to illustrate the phenomenon graphically, a scatter plot and a line graph. Subsequently, these can be overlaid, resulting in a overlay plot. The plots are applied to the recent large meta-analysis of adverse effects of rosiglitazone on myocardial infarction and to an example from the literature. A large set of meta-analyses is screened for further examples. RESULTS: As noted earlier by others, occurrence of Simpson's paradox in the meta-analytic setting, if present, is associated with imbalance of treatment arm size. This is well illustrated by the proposed plots. The rosiglitazone meta-analysis shows an effect reversion if all trials are pooled. In a sample of 157 meta-analyses, nine showed an effect reversion after pooling, though non-significant in all cases. CONCLUSION: The plots give insight on how the imbalance of trial arm size works as a confounder, thus producing Simpson's paradox. Readers can see why meta-analytic methods must be used and what is wrong with simple pooling.","['Rucker, Gerta', 'Schumacher, Martin']","['Rucker G', 'Schumacher M']","['Institute of Medical Biometry and Medical Informatics, University Medical Center Freiburg, Germany. ruecker@imbi.uni-freiburg.de']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,BMC Med Res Methodol,BMC medical research methodology,100968545,"['0 (Thiazolidinediones)', '05V02F2KDG (Rosiglitazone)']",IM,"['Child', '*Data Interpretation, Statistical', 'Electric Power Supplies/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/etiology', '*Meta-Analysis as Topic', 'Myocardial Infarction/*chemically induced', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Rosiglitazone', 'Sample Size', 'Statistics as Topic', 'Thiazolidinediones/*adverse effects']",2008/06/03 09:00,2008/07/11 09:00,['2008/06/03 09:00'],"['2007/12/04 00:00 [received]', '2008/05/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/06/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/11 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['1471-2288-8-34 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2288-8-34 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Med Res Methodol. 2008 May 30;8:34. doi: 10.1186/1471-2288-8-34.,,,,,20080530,PMC2438436,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study aims to establish a new strategy that provides for the rapid establishment of human clonal marrow stem cell (hcMSC) lines with a relatively small amount of bone marrow aspirate and to characterize newly generated hcMSC lines for their cell phenotype, differentiation potential, lineage-specific gene expression, and cytokine secretion. Human cMSC lines were generated with human bone marrow aspirates using a new protocol, called the subfractionation culturing method. The newly established hcMSC lines were analyzed for their cell surface epitopes by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), differentiation potential by in vitro differentiation assays, lineage-specific gene expression by RT-PCR, and cytokine secretion by enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA). The overall profile of the cell-surface epitopes of the newly established hcMSC lines was similar to those of the known MSCs. These hcMSC lines were capable of differentiating into multilineages with some differences in differentiation capability. In addition, these hcMSC lines secrete high levels of transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), TGF-alpha, and interleukein-10 (IL-10), again with some variation in each cell line. The newly designed protocol may be an efficient method to establish hcMSC lines rapidly with a relatively small amount of bone marrow sample, and these newly established hcMSC lines possess stem cell characteristics and exhibit some differences in cell-surface epitopes, differentiation potential, lineage-specific gene expression, and cytokine secretion.","['Song, S U', 'Kim, C S', 'Yoon, S P', 'Kim, S K', 'Lee, M H', 'Kang, J S', 'Choi, G S', 'Moon, S H', 'Choi, M S', 'Cho, Y K', 'Son, B K']","['Song SU', 'Kim CS', 'Yoon SP', 'Kim SK', 'Lee MH', 'Kang JS', 'Choi GS', 'Moon SH', 'Choi MS', 'Cho YK', 'Son BK']","['Clinical Research Center and Inha University, 7-206, 3-Ga, Shinheung-Dong, Chung-Gu, Incheon, Korea. sunuksong@inha.ac.kr']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Stem Cells Dev,Stem cells and development,101197107,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Epitopes)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow Cells/*cytology', 'Cell Count', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cell Membrane/*metabolism', 'Clone Cells', 'Cytokines/*metabolism', 'Epitopes/*metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/cytology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Stem Cells/*cytology/metabolism']",2008/06/03 09:00,2008/08/30 09:00,['2008/06/03 09:00'],"['2008/06/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/30 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/03 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/scd.2007.0167 [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cells Dev. 2008 Jun;17(3):451-61. doi: 10.1089/scd.2007.0167.,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MSCs have the capability to self-renew and retain multipotency after extensive expansion in vitro, making them attractive targets for ex vivo modification and autologous transplantation. Viral vectors, including lentiviral vectors, provide an efficient means for transgene delivery into human MSCs. In contrast, mouse MSCs have proven more difficult to transduce with lentiviral vectors than their human counterparts, and because many studies use mouse models of human disease, an improved method of transduction would facilitate studies using ex vivo-modified mouse MSCs. We have worked toward improving the production of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-based lentiviral vectors and optimizing transduction conditions for mouse MSCs using lentivirus vectors pseudotyped with the vesicular stomatitis virus G glycoprotein (VSV-G), the ecotropic murine leukemia virus envelope glycoprotein (MLV-E), and the glycoproteins derived from the Armstrong and WE strains of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV-Arm, LCMV-WE). Mouse MSCs were readily transduced following overnight incubation using a multiplicity of infection of at least 40. Alternatively, mouse MSCs in suspension were readily transduced after a 1-h exposure to lentiviral pseudotypes immediately following trypsin treatment or retrieval from storage in liquid nitrogen. LCMV-WE pseudotypes resulted in efficient transduction of mouse MSCs with less toxicity than VSV-G pseudotypes. In conclusion, our improved production and transduction conditions for lentiviral vectors resulted in efficient transduction of mouse MSCs, and these improvements should facilitate the application of such cells in the context of mouse models of human disease.","['Ricks, David M', 'Kutner, Robert', 'Zhang, Xian-Yang', 'Welsh, David A', 'Reiser, Jakob']","['Ricks DM', 'Kutner R', 'Zhang XY', 'Welsh DA', 'Reiser J']","['Gene Therapy Program, Department of Medicine, LSU Health Sciences Center, New Orleans, LA 70112, USA.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Stem Cells Dev,Stem cells and development,101197107,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD9 protein, human)', '0 (Cd9 protein, mouse)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Lipids)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-8B)', '0 (Tetraspanin 29)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*cytology', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Glycoproteins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lentivirus/*metabolism', 'Lipids/pharmacology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/metabolism', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/cytology/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Receptors, Interleukin-8B/metabolism', 'Tetraspanin 29', 'Time Factors', '*Transduction, Genetic']",2008/06/03 09:00,2008/08/30 09:00,['2008/06/03 09:00'],"['2008/06/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/30 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/03 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/scd.2007.0194 [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cells Dev. 2008 Jun;17(3):441-50. doi: 10.1089/scd.2007.0194.,3,,,"['R01 HL073770/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P40RR017447/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'NS044832/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL073770-04/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL073770-03/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL073770-04S1/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL073770-02/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL073770-01/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL075161/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL073770/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC2996877,['NIHMS185161'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because little is known about the protective role of natural antioxidants, such as polyphenols, for the myeloperoxidase-derived DNA damage, we screened the inhibitory effects of various phenolic antioxidants on the chlorination of the 2'-deoxycytidine residue by HOCl in vitro and found that green tea catechins, especially (-)-epicatechin gallate (ECg) and (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCg), significantly inhibited the chlorination. These catechins also reduced nucleoside- and taurine-chloramines, which can induce secondary oxidative damage, into their native forms. Mass spectrometric and nuclear magnetic resonance analyses showed that ECg and EGCg can effectively scavenge HOCl and/or chloramine species resulting in the formation of mono- and dichlorinated ECg and EGCg. Using the HL-60 human leukemia cell line, it was found that ECg could efficiently accumulate in the cells. Immunocytometric analyses using antihalogenated 2'-deoxycytidine antibody showed that pretreatment of cells with ECg inhibited the HOCl-induced immunofluorescence. In addition, the chlorinated ECg derivatives were detected in the HOCl-treated HL-60 cells. These results showed that green tea catechins, especially 3-galloylated catechins, may be the plausible candidate for the prevention of inflammation-derived DNA damage and perhaps carcinogenesis.","['Kawai, Yoshichika', 'Matsui, Yuri', 'Kondo, Hajime', 'Morinaga, Hiroshi', 'Uchida, Koji', 'Miyoshi, Noriyuki', 'Nakamura, Yoshimasa', 'Osawa, Toshihiko']","['Kawai Y', 'Matsui Y', 'Kondo H', 'Morinaga H', 'Uchida K', 'Miyoshi N', 'Nakamura Y', 'Osawa T']","['Laboratory of Food Biodynamics, Graduate School of Bioagricultural Sciences, Nagoya University, Nagoya 464-8601, Japan. y-kawai@nutr.med.tokushima-u.ac.jp']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Chem Res Toxicol,Chemical research in toxicology,8807448,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Free Radical Scavengers)', '0 (Oxidants)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Tea)', '712K4CDC10 (Hypochlorous Acid)', '8R1V1STN48 (Catechin)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', '91080-16-9 (calf thymus DNA)', '92587OVD8Z (epicatechin gallate)', 'HEJ6575V1X (gallocatechol)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Catechin/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Cattle', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'DNA/chemistry/drug effects', 'DNA Damage/*drug effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/chemistry/*drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Antagonism', 'Free Radical Scavengers/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Halogenation', 'Humans', 'Hypochlorous Acid/antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/*toxicity', 'Oxidants/antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/*toxicity', 'Plant Extracts/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Tea/chemistry']",2008/06/03 09:00,2008/09/13 09:00,['2008/06/03 09:00'],"['2008/06/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/13 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/03 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/tx800069e [doi]'],ppublish,Chem Res Toxicol. 2008 Jul;21(7):1407-14. doi: 10.1021/tx800069e.

METHODS: PML-RAR alpha fusion gene was detected by RT-PCR in 33 APL patients. The optical density of three bands including E5 (+) E6 (+) 636 bp (no deletion), E5 (-) E6 (+) 492 bp (exon 5 deleted) and E5 (-) E6 (-) 232 bp (both exon 5 and exon 6 deleted) was measured by a UVP analysis system and their relative proportions were calculated. The relative expression level of each splicing band, initial WBC count and age were statistically (for single and multi-factor analysis) analyzed with prognosis. RESULTS: The relative expressions of E5 (-) E6 (+) and E5 (-) E6 (-) in death group were obviously different from that in first complete remission (CR1) group (P < 0.01), but do not for E5 (+) E6 (+) (P > 0.05). The relative expression levels of E5 (-) E6 (+), E5 (-) E6 (-) and E5 (+) E6 (+) were 0.23 +/- 0.12, 0.58 +/- 0.18, 0.20 +/- 0.09 in death group, and 0.45 +/- 0.16, 0.23 +/- 0.12, 0.31 +/- 0.16 in CR1 group, respectively. Initial WBC count and age was no difference between the two groups (P > 0.05). Logistic regression analysis showed that the expression of E5 (-) E6 (+) had no effect on the prognosis (B = 3.475, P = 0.492), but the expression of E5 (-) E6 (-) showed a negative correlation with prognosis (B = -19.660, P = 0.046). CONCLUSIONS: The high expression of E5 (-) E6 (-) is correlated with the poor prognosis for patients with APL.","['Tan, Yan-Hong', 'Wang, Hong-Wei', 'Zhang, Zhi-Ping', 'Liu, Wei', 'Guo, Hui-Min', 'Zhu, Lei', 'Zhang, Li']","['Tan YH', 'Wang HW', 'Zhang ZP', 'Liu W', 'Guo HM', 'Zhu L', 'Zhang L']","['Institute of Hematology, 2nd Hospital of Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan 030001, China.']",,['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",China,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua xue ye xue za zhi = Zhonghua xueyexue zazhi,8212398,"['0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Alternative Splicing', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Young Adult']",2008/06/03 09:00,2010/03/10 06:00,['2008/06/03 09:00'],"['2008/06/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/10 06:00 [medline]', '2008/06/03 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2008 Jan;29(1):44-7.,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The immunophenotype of leukemia cells from 51 CD34+ CD38+ CD7+ and/or CD34+ CD38+ CD56+ acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients (exclude M3) at diagnosis was analyzed by using 4 - 6 panels of 4 color antibodies, and cells from 28 normal bone marrow (NBM) samples were served as control. The expression of CD7 and CD56 in the CD34+ CD38+ subpopulation was used as a leukemic cell marker for monitoring MRD of 53 samples from 26 CD7+ and (or) CD56+ patients. RESULTS: In CD7+ and/or CD56+ AML patients at diagnosis, the average positivity of CD7 in CD34+ CD38+ subpopulation and CD34+ CD38- Lin- stem cells subpopulation was (77.39 +/- 20.71)% and (44.57 +/- 22.70)%, and that of CD56 was (56.71 +/- 32.56)% and (33.51 +/- 29.64)%, respectively, all significantly higher than that of NBM (P < 0.01 and P < 0.05). Compared with that of NBM, the expression of CD90 in AML patients was significantly lower in the CD34+ CD38- Lin- subpopulation (P < 0.01), the expression of CD123 was significantly higher than NBM (P < 0.01), and the expression of CD117 was no significant difference (P > 0.05). In follow up of CD7+ and (or) CD56+ patients, the expression rate of CD7 and (or) CD56 in the CD34+ CD38- Lin- subpopulation MRD+ group was significantly higher than that in the MRD- group. The actual rate for CD7 was 71% (15/21) and 16% (4/25) (P = 0.001), and its relative rate was 81% (17/ 21) and 24% (6/25) (P = 0.000), respectively.

The inhibitory function of TGIF is executed in part through its ability to sequester the tumour suppressor cytoplasmic promyelocytic leukaemia (cPML) in the nucleus, thereby preventing the phosphorylation of Smad2 by the activated TGF-beta type I receptor. Here, we report on the identification of PCTA (PML competitor for TGIF association), a TGIF antagonist that promotes TGF-beta-induced transcriptional and cytostatic responses. We provide evidence that PCTA functions in TGF-beta signalling by relieving the suppression of Smad2 phosphorylation by TGIF. Furthermore, we demonstrate that PCTA selectively competes with cPML for TGIF association, resulting in the accumulation of cPML in the cytoplasm, where it associates with SARA and coordinates the access of Smad2 for phosphorylation by the activated TGF-beta type I receptor. Thus, our findings on the mode of action of PCTA provide new and important insights into the molecular mechanism underlying the antagonistic interplay between TGIF and cPML in the TGF-beta signalling network.","['Faresse, Nourdine', 'Colland, Frederic', 'Ferrand, Nathalie', 'Prunier, Celine', 'Bourgeade, Marie-Francoise', 'Atfi, Azeddine']","['Faresse N', 'Colland F', 'Ferrand N', 'Prunier C', 'Bourgeade MF', 'Atfi A']","['Laboratory of Cell Signaling and Carcinogenesis, INSERM U673, Paris, France.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (SMAD2 protein, human)', '0 (Smad2 Protein)', '0 (TGIF1 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (IRF2BP1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Carrier Proteins/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'DNA, Complementary', 'Dogs', 'Female', 'Gene Library', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Placenta/metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Repressor Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Smad2 Protein/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*metabolism', 'Two-Hybrid System Techniques', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases']",2008/05/31 09:00,2008/07/23 09:00,['2008/05/31 09:00'],"['2007/12/17 00:00 [received]', '2008/05/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/05/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/23 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/31 09:00 [entrez]']","['emboj2008109 [pii]', '10.1038/emboj.2008.109 [doi]']",ppublish,EMBO J. 2008 Jul 9;27(13):1804-15. doi: 10.1038/emboj.2008.109.

Expression of SphK1 is up-regulated in cancers, including leukemia, and associated with cancer progression. A screen of sphingosine analogs identified (2R,3S,4E)-N-methyl-5-(4'-pentylphenyl)-2-aminopent-4-ene-1,3-diol, designated SK1-I (BML-258), as a potent, water-soluble, isoenzyme-specific inhibitor of SphK1. In contrast to pan-SphK inhibitors, SK1-I did not inhibit SphK2, PKC, or numerous other protein kinases. SK1-I decreased growth and survival of human leukemia U937 and Jurkat cells, and enhanced apoptosis and cleavage of Bcl-2. Lethality of SK1-I was reversed by caspase inhibitors and by expression of Bcl-2. SK1-I not only decreased S1P levels but concomitantly increased levels of its proapoptotic precursor ceramide. Conversely, S1P protected against SK1-I-induced apoptosis. SK1-I also induced multiple perturbations in activation of signaling and survival-related proteins, including diminished phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and Akt. Expression of constitutively active Akt protected against SK1-I-induced apoptosis. Notably, SK1-I potently induced apoptosis in leukemic blasts isolated from patients with acute myelogenous leukemia but was relatively sparing of normal peripheral blood mononuclear leukocytes. Moreover, SK1-I markedly reduced growth of AML xenograft tumors. Our results suggest that specific inhibitors of SphK1 warrant attention as potential additions to the therapeutic armamentarium in leukemia.","['Paugh, Steven W', 'Paugh, Barbara S', 'Rahmani, Mohamed', 'Kapitonov, Dmitri', 'Almenara, Jorge A', 'Kordula, Tomasz', 'Milstien, Sheldon', 'Adams, Jeffrey K', 'Zipkin, Robert E', 'Grant, Steven', 'Spiegel, Sarah']","['Paugh SW', 'Paugh BS', 'Rahmani M', 'Kapitonov D', 'Almenara JA', 'Kordula T', 'Milstien S', 'Adams JK', 'Zipkin RE', 'Grant S', 'Spiegel S']","['Departments ofBiochemistry and Molecular Biology, Virginia Commonwealth University School of Medicine and Massey Cancer Center, Richmond, VA 23298-0614, USA.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor))', 'EC 2.7.1.- (sphingosine kinase)', 'NGZ37HRE42 (Sphingosine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor)/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Sphingosine/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2008/05/31 09:00,2008/09/17 09:00,['2008/05/31 09:00'],"['2008/05/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/31 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)49729-0 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2008-02-138958 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2008 Aug 15;112(4):1382-91. doi: 10.1182/blood-2008-02-138958.

The 8;21(q22;q22) chromosomal translocation is one of the most common chromosome abnormalities identified in leukemia. It generates fusion proteins between AML1 and ETO. Since AML1 is a well-defined DNA-binding protein, AML1-ETO fusion proteins have been recognized as DNA-binding proteins interacting with the same consensus DNA-binding site as AML1. The alteration of AML1 target gene expression due to the presence of AML1-ETO is related to the development of leukemia. Here, using a 25-bp random double-stranded oligonucleotide library and a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based DNA-binding site screen, we show that compared with native AML1, AML1-ETO fusion proteins preferentially bind to DNA sequences with duplicated AML1 consensus sites. This finding is further confirmed by both in vitro and in vivo DNA-protein interaction assays. These results suggest that AML1-ETO fusion proteins have a selective preference for certain AML1 target genes that contain multimerized AML1 consensus sites in their regulatory elements. Such selected regulation provides an important molecular mechanism for the dysregulation of gene expression during cancer development.","['Okumura, Akiko J', 'Peterson, Luke F', 'Okumura, Fumihiko', 'Boyapati, Anita', 'Zhang, Dong-Er']","['Okumura AJ', 'Peterson LF', 'Okumura F', 'Boyapati A', 'Zhang DE']","['Department of Molecular and Experimental Medicine, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA 92093, USA.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (AML1-ETO fusion protein, human)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Oligonucleotides)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*genetics/*metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', '*Enhancer Elements, Genetic', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Library', 'Humans', 'Oligonucleotides/*metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', '*Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Translocation, Genetic']",2008/05/31 09:00,2008/09/17 09:00,['2008/05/31 09:00'],"['2008/05/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/31 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)49730-7 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2007-11-124735 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2008 Aug 15;112(4):1392-401. doi: 10.1182/blood-2007-11-124735.

We have previously found that in interleukin (IL)-2-independent transformed HTLV-I cells, Tax strongly activates the hTERT promoter through nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB)-mediated Sp1 and c-Myc activation. In IL-2-dependent cells and adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) patient samples, however, Tax expression is very low to undetectable, yet these cells retain strong telomerase activity. This suggests the existence of compensatory mechanisms in IL-2-dependent cells and ATLL patients. In this study, we demonstrate that telomerase activity is significantly decreased upon IL-2 withdrawal in immortalized HTLV-I cell lines. Inhibition of PI3K or AKT signaling pathways reduced telomerase activity in HTLV-I cells. We found that IL-2/IL-2R signaling was associated with a PI3K-dependent/AKT-independent transcriptional up-regulation of the endogenous hTERT promoter. We found that activation of the PI3K pathway mediated cytoplasmic retention of the Wilms tumor (WTI) protein, which strongly suppressed the hTERT promoter. The importance of this regulatory pathway for telomerase expression is underscored by findings that the PI3K pathway is commonly found activated in cancer cells.","['Bellon, Marcia', 'Nicot, Christophe']","['Bellon M', 'Nicot C']","['Department of Microbiology, Immunology, and Molecular Genetics, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, USA.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (TERT protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/drug effects/genetics', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'HTLV-I Infections/*enzymology/*genetics', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/drug effects/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Protein Binding/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Telomerase/*genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Transcriptional Activation/drug effects/*genetics', 'WT1 Proteins/metabolism']",2008/05/31 09:00,2008/10/10 09:00,['2008/05/31 09:00'],"['2008/05/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/10 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/31 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)59821-2 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2008-01-134692 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2008 Oct 1;112(7):2946-55. doi: 10.1182/blood-2008-01-134692.

We previously showed that the cytoplasmic domain of the hematopoietic receptor, betac, which is shared by IL-5, IL-3, and GM-CSF, is directly ubiquitinated and degraded by the proteasomes in a JAK2-dependent manner. However, studies describing the spatial distribution, endocytic regulation, and trafficking of betac-sharing receptors in human eosinophils are currently lacking. Using deconvolution microscopy and biochemical methods, we clearly demonstrate that IL-5Rs reside in and are internalized by clathrin- and lipid raft-dependent endocytic pathways. Microscopy analyses in TF1 cells and human eosinophils revealed significant colocalization of betac, IL-5Ralpha, and Cy3-labeled IL-5 with transferrin- (clathrin) and cholera toxin-B- (lipid raft) positive vesicles. Moreover, whereas internalized IL-5Rs were detected in both clathrin- and lipid raft-positive vesicles, biochemical data revealed that tyrosine phosphorylated, ubiquitinated, and proteasome-degraded IL-5Rs partitioned to the soluble, nonraft fractions (clathrin-containing). Lastly, we show that optimal IL-5-induced signaling requires entry of activated IL-5Rs into the intracellular compartment, as coimmunoprecipitation of key signaling molecules with the IL-5R was completely blocked when either endocytic pathway was inhibited. These data provide the first evidence that IL-5Rs segregate and traffic into two distinct plasma membrane compartments, and they further establish that IL-5R endocytosis regulates signaling both positively and negatively.","['Lei, Jonathan T', 'Martinez-Moczygemba, Margarita']","['Lei JT', 'Martinez-Moczygemba M']","['Biology of Inflammation Center, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030-3411, USA.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,"['0 (Clathrin)', '0 (Interleukin-5)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-5)', '0 (Transferrin)', '9012-63-9 (Cholera Toxin)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Membrane/drug effects/physiology', 'Cholera Toxin/pharmacology', 'Clathrin/physiology', 'Endocytosis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Eosinophils/*physiology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-5/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Receptors, Interleukin-5/*physiology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/physiology', 'Transferrin/pharmacology/*physiology']",2008/05/31 09:00,2008/09/05 09:00,['2008/05/31 09:00'],"['2008/05/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/05 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/31 09:00 [entrez]']","['jlb.1207828 [pii]', '10.1189/jlb.1207828 [doi]']",ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 2008 Aug;84(2):499-509. doi: 10.1189/jlb.1207828.

There are two pathways for RA action; one via RA nuclear receptors (RARs), and one via acylation of proteins by RA (retinoylation). However, an understanding of which actions of RA occur via RARs and which occur via retinoylation is lacking. Thus, we undertook the examination of HL60 proteins using anti-RA monoclonal antibodies (ARMAs). These ARMAs showed specific binding to proteins in a saturable manner depending on protein and antibody concentration. Proteins eluted by Mono Q anion exchange chromatography and separated using two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were detected by ARMAs. One of these ARMA-bound proteins in HL60 cells was identified as alpha-actinin. These results indicate that retinoylated proteins in HL60 cells can be recognized by ARMAs and that alpha-actinin modified by RA may play a significant role in RA-induced differentiation, including the promotion of cytomorphology changes.","['Kubo, Yoshinori', 'Ohba, Toshihiro', 'Takahashi, Noriko']","['Kubo Y', 'Ohba T', 'Takahashi N']","['Institute of Medicinal Chemistry, Hoshi University, Shinagawa, Tokyo, 142-8501, Japan.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Biochem,Journal of biochemistry,0376600,"['0 (Anions)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Ions)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '11003-00-2 (Actinin)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Actinin/chemistry', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Anions', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*chemistry', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Chromatography, Ion Exchange/methods', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Ions', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/chemistry', 'Protein Binding', 'Subcellular Fractions/metabolism', 'Tretinoin/*chemistry']",2008/05/31 09:00,2008/11/14 09:00,['2008/05/31 09:00'],"['2008/05/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/11/14 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/31 09:00 [entrez]']","['mvn071 [pii]', '10.1093/jb/mvn071 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biochem. 2008 Sep;144(3):349-55. doi: 10.1093/jb/mvn071.

NPM1 is one of the most abundant proteins found in the nucleolus and has links to the MDM2/p53 tumor suppressor pathway. A distinctive feature of NPM1 mutants in AML is their aberrant localization to the cytoplasm of leukemic cells. This mutant phenotype is the result of the substitution of several C-terminal residues, including one or two conserved tryptophan residues, with a leucine-rich nuclear export signal. The exact molecular mechanism underlying the loss of nucleolar retention, and the role of the tryptophans, remains unknown. In this study we have determined the structure of an independently folded globular domain in the C terminus of NPM1 using NMR spectroscopy, and we report that the conserved tryptophans are critical for structure. This domain is necessary for the nucleolar targeting of NPM1 and is disrupted by mutations in AML with cytoplasmic NPM1. Furthermore, we identify conserved surface-exposed lysine residues that are functionally rather than structurally important for nucleolar localization. This study provides new focus for efforts to understand the pathogenesis of AML with cytoplasmic NPM1 and may be used to aid the design of small molecules that target the C-terminal domain of NPM1 to act as novel anti-proliferative and anti-leukemia therapeutics.","['Grummitt, Charles G', 'Townsley, Fiona M', 'Johnson, Christopher M', 'Warren, Alan J', 'Bycroft, Mark']","['Grummitt CG', 'Townsley FM', 'Johnson CM', 'Warren AJ', 'Bycroft M']","['Medical Research Council Centre for Protein Engineering, Cambridge CB2 0QH, UK.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', '8DUH1N11BX (Tryptophan)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cell Nucleolus/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Mutation', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Tryptophan/chemistry']",2008/05/31 09:00,2008/10/07 09:00,['2008/05/31 09:00'],"['2008/05/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/07 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/31 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(19)49389-7 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M801706200 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2008 Aug 22;283(34):23326-32. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M801706200.

Chlorambucil has been shown to be detoxified by human glutathione transferase Pi (GST P1-1), an enzyme that is often found over-expressed in cancer tissues. The allelic variants of GST P1-1 are associated with differing susceptibilities to leukaemia and differ markedly in their efficiency in catalysing glutathione (GSH) conjugation reactions. Here, we perform detailed kinetic studies of the allelic variants with the aid of three representative co-substrates. We show that the differing catalytic properties of the variants are highly substrate-dependent. We show also that all variants exhibit the same temperature stability in the range 10 degrees C to 45 degrees C. We have determined the crystal structures of GST P1-1 in complex with chlorambucil and its GSH conjugate for two of these allelic variants that have different residues at positions 104 and 113. Chlorambucil is found to bind in a non-productive mode to the substrate-binding site (H-site) in the absence of GSH. This result suggests that under certain stress conditions where GSH levels are low, GST P1-1 can inactivate the drug by sequestering it from the surrounding medium. However, in the presence of GSH, chlorambucil binds in the H-site in a productive mode and undergoes a conjugation reaction with GSH present in the crystal. The crystal structure of the GSH-chlorambucil complex bound to the *C variant is identical with the *A variant ruling out the hypothesis that primary structure differences between the variants cause structural changes at the active site. Finally, we show that chlorambucil is a very poor inhibitor of the enzyme in contrast to ethacrynic acid, which binds to the enzyme in a similar fashion but can act as both substrate and inhibitor.","['Parker, Lorien J', 'Ciccone, Sarah', 'Italiano, Louis C', 'Primavera, Alessandra', 'Oakley, Aaron J', 'Morton, Craig J', 'Hancock, Nancy C', 'Bello, Mario Lo', 'Parker, Michael W']","['Parker LJ', 'Ciccone S', 'Italiano LC', 'Primavera A', 'Oakley AJ', 'Morton CJ', 'Hancock NC', 'Bello ML', 'Parker MW']","[""Biota Structural Biology Laboratory, St. Vincent's Institute of Medical Research, Fitzroy, Victoria 3065, Australia.""]",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",England,J Mol Biol,Journal of molecular biology,2985088R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Mutant Proteins)', '18D0SL7309 (Chlorambucil)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione S-Transferase pi)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'M5DP350VZV (Ethacrynic Acid)']",IM,"['*Alleles', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Chlorambucil/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Crystallography, X-Ray', 'Enzyme Stability', 'Ethacrynic Acid/chemistry', 'Glutathione/chemistry', 'Glutathione S-Transferase pi/antagonists & inhibitors/*chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Mutant Proteins/chemistry/metabolism', '*Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Protein Structure, Secondary', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Temperature']",2008/05/31 09:00,2008/06/26 09:00,['2008/05/31 09:00'],"['2008/01/10 00:00 [received]', '2008/04/14 00:00 [revised]', '2008/04/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/05/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/26 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/31 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0022-2836(08)00533-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jmb.2008.04.066 [doi]']",ppublish,J Mol Biol. 2008 Jun 27;380(1):131-44. doi: 10.1016/j.jmb.2008.04.066.

AIM: To evaluate the incidence of TB in paediatric oncology patients at Tygerberg Hospital, located in a Cape Town area of high TB prevalence, and to describe the clinical characteristics of the disease in this particular group of patients whose treatment typically suppresses their immune response. METHODS: We reviewed the records of 625 paediatric oncology patients admitted from 1 January 1991 to 31 December 2005. Of these, 87 received treatment for TB; however, only 57 cases had sufficient data to support a diagnosis of TB and only these were used for further analysis. RESULTS: In the children with TB, acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) was the most common malignancy (13/57, 22.8%). The incidence of TB in the study group was 9117/100,000/year, which is 22 times higher than the overall TB incidence reported in children from a similar background. Importantly, 47% of the active infections appeared in the 1st 5 months of chemotherapy, suggesting reactivation of latent TB. CONCLUSIONS: Identifying latent TB in our patients and providing prophylactic treatment during the initial months of chemotherapy might have prevented disease progression in these cases. Routine screening of paediatric oncology patients for latent TB infection and exclusion of active disease prior to initiation of cancer therapy might be indicated in TB-endemic areas.","['Stefan, D C', 'Kruis, A L', 'Schaaf, H S', 'Wessels, G']","['Stefan DC', 'Kruis AL', 'Schaaf HS', 'Wessels G']","['Department of Paediatrics & Child Health, Tygerberg Hospital, Stellenbosch University, South Africa. cs@sun.ac.za']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Ann Trop Paediatr,Annals of tropical paediatrics,8210625,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*complications', 'Opportunistic Infections/*complications/epidemiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications', 'South Africa/epidemiology', 'Tuberculosis/*complications/epidemiology']",2008/05/31 09:00,2008/08/22 09:00,['2008/05/31 09:00'],"['2008/05/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/22 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/31 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1179/146532808X302125 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Trop Paediatr. 2008 Jun;28(2):111-6. doi: 10.1179/146532808X302125.,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As regards human normal bone marrow, detailed characterization of ALDH+ cells has been addressed by one single study (Gentry et al, 2007). The goal of our work was to provide new information about the dissection of normal bone marrow progenitor cells based upon the simultaneous detection by flow cytometry of ALDH and early hematopoietic antigens, with particular attention to the expression of ALDH on erythroid precursors. To this aim, we used three kinds of approach: i) multidimensional analytical flow cytometry, detecting ALDH and early hematopoietic antigens in normal bone marrow; ii) fluorescence activated cell sorting of distinct subpopulations of progenitor cells, followed by in vitro induction of erythroid differentiation; iii) detection of ALDH+ cellular subsets in bone marrow from pure red cell aplasia patients. RESULTS: In normal bone marrow, we identified three populations of cells, namely ALDH+CD34+, ALDH-CD34+ and ALDH+CD34- (median percentages were 0.52, 0.53 and 0.57, respectively). As compared to ALDH-CD34+ cells, ALDH+CD34+ cells expressed the phenotypic profile of primitive hematopoietic progenitor cells, with brighter expression of CD117 and CD133, accompanied by lower display of CD38 and CD45RA. Of interest, ALDH+CD34- population disclosed a straightforward erythroid commitment, on the basis of three orders of evidences. First of all, ALDH+CD34- cells showed a CD71bright, CD105+, CD45- phenotype. Secondly, induction of differentiation experiments evidenced a clear-cut expression of glycophorin A (CD235a). Finally, ALDH+CD34- precursors were not detectable in patients with pure red cell aplasia (PRCA). CONCLUSION: Our study, comparing surface antigen expression of ALDH+/CD34+, ALDH-/CD34+ and ALDH+/CD34- progenitor cell subsets in human bone marrow, clearly indicated that ALDH+CD34- cells are mainly committed towards erythropoiesis. To the best of our knowledge this finding is new and could be useful for basic studies about normal erythropoietic differentiation as well as for enabling the employment of ALDH as a red cell marker in polychromatic flow cytometry characterization of bone marrow from patients with aplastic anemia and myelodysplasia.","['Mirabelli, Peppino', 'Di Noto, Rosa', 'Lo Pardo, Catia', 'Morabito, Paolo', 'Abate, Giovanna', 'Gorrese, Marisa', 'Raia, Maddalena', 'Pascariello, Caterina', 'Scalia, Giulia', 'Gemei, Marica', 'Mariotti, Elisabetta', 'Del Vecchio, Luigi']","['Mirabelli P', 'Di Noto R', 'Lo Pardo C', 'Morabito P', 'Abate G', 'Gorrese M', 'Raia M', 'Pascariello C', 'Scalia G', 'Gemei M', 'Mariotti E', 'Del Vecchio L']","['Servizio di Immunoematologia e Medicina Trasfusionale, Ospedale A.

T cells bearing alphabeta T-cell receptors (TCR) expressed increased amounts of CD95 and of CD45RO, which are phenotypically memory T cells. The TCR repertoire was broad and diverse. Regardless of CD95 expression, these cells were resistant to CD95-mediated apoptosis. Aggressive natural killer cell leukaemia (ANKL) without an association with Epstein-Barr virus was detected 1 month after therapeutic splenectomy that followed 3 yr of immunosuppressive therapy against HPS. The immunophenotype of these leukaemia cells was CD56, CD16(dim), CD7, CD45RA and they expressed some CD2, CD8 and HLA-DR. Moreover, hyperdiploid clones with complex chromosomal abnormalities were also detected. Latent NK-cell malignancy seemed to cause the CD95-resistant memory T-cell proliferation and splenectomy resulted in overt ANKL progression.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sequential dose-escalating cohorts of three to six patients with hematological malignancies received belinostat administered as a 30-min i.v. infusion on days 1-5 of a 21-d cycle. Experience from a parallel dose-finding study in patients with solid tumors influenced the selection of the final dose. RESULTS: Sixteen patients received belinostat at one of three dose levels: 600 mg/m(2)/d (three patients), 900 mg/m(2)/d (three patients) and 1000 mg/m(2)/d (10 patients), the dose determined to be the MTD in a phase I solid tumor study [Steele et al. (2008) Clin Cancer Res, 14, 804-10]. The most common treatment-related adverse events (all grades) were nausea (50%), vomiting (31%), fatigue (31%) and flushing (31%). No grade 3 or 4 hematological toxicity compared with baseline occurred except one case of grade 3 lymphopenia. There were two related grade 4 adverse events of renal failure observed. Both events occurred in patients with multiple myeloma and had similar characteristics, i.e. an acute episode of decrease in renal function (pre-existing nephropathy in one patient), with a metabolic profile and decrease in tumor burden consistent with tumor lysis syndrome. No other related grade 4 events were noted. The only related grade 3 events noticed in more than one patient were fatigue and neurological symptoms (one patient had status epilepticus in association with uremia and one patient had paresthesia), all other related grade 3 events occurred in single patients. No cardiac events were noted. No complete or partial remissions were noted in these heavily pre-treated (median of four prior regimens) patients. However, five patients, including two patients with diffuse large-cell lymphoma [including one patient with transformed chronic myelocytic leukaemia (CLL)], two patients with CLL and one patient with multiple myeloma, achieved disease stabilization in of two to nine treatment cycles. CONCLUSIONS: Intravenous belinostat at 600, 900 and 1000 mg/m(2)/d is well tolerated by patients with hematological malignancies. The study was carried out in parallel to a similar dose-finding study in patients with solid tumors, in which the MTD was determined to be 1000 mg/m(2)/d days 1-5 in a 21-d cycle. This dose can also be recommended for phase II studies in patients with hematological neoplasms.","['Gimsing, Peter', 'Hansen, Mads', 'Knudsen, Lene M', 'Knoblauch, P', 'Christensen, Ib Jarle', 'Ooi, Chean Eng', 'Buhl-Jensen, Peter']","['Gimsing P', 'Hansen M', 'Knudsen LM', 'Knoblauch P', 'Christensen IJ', 'Ooi CE', 'Buhl-Jensen P']","['Department of Hematology, Finsen Center, University Hospital Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark. peter.gimsing@rh.regionh.dk']",,['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', 'F4H96P17NZ (belinostat)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Disease Progression', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Male', 'Maximum Tolerated Dose', 'Middle Aged', 'Remission Induction', 'Sulfonamides', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",2008/05/31 09:00,2008/10/08 09:00,['2008/05/31 09:00'],"['2008/05/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/08 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/31 09:00 [entrez]']","['EJH1102 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-0609.2008.01102.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2008 Sep;81(3):170-6. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2008.01102.x.

Hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) are believed to be the target cell for leukemia-initiating MLL rearrangement events. Although etoposide treatment is sufficient to induce readily detectable MLL rearrangements in primary human CD34+ cells, the majority of cells that gain translocations do not proliferate in culture possibly due to reduced proliferative capacity of most CD34+ cells during normal differentiation [Blood 2005;105:2124]. We characterized the impact of etoposide on primary human long-term repopulating HSC that represent only a minor portion of CD34+ cells. The proliferative capacity of HSC is dramatically increased following both a single and multiple exposures to etoposide as determined by their ability to engraft bone marrow of immune-deficient non-obese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient mice and to initiate hematopoiesis in long-term initiating cultures. Similar to results in CD34+ cells, a significant proportion of etoposide-treated HSC-derived clones harbored stable MLL rearrangements, including duplications, inversions and translocations. These results indicate HSC are highly susceptible to etoposide-induced and potentially oncogenic rearrangements initiating within MLL, and these HSC are particularly proficient for continued long-term proliferation both in vivo and in vitro.","['Libura, Jolanta', 'Ward, Maureen', 'Solecka, Joanna', 'Richardson, Christine']","['Libura J', 'Ward M', 'Solecka J', 'Richardson C']","['Department of Pathology, Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA. jl2278@columbia.edu']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Lipids)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD34/drug effects/immunology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*toxicity', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromosome Aberrations/*chemically induced', 'Etoposide/*toxicity', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*drug effects/immunology', 'Humans', 'Lipids/biosynthesis', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*genetics', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/methods', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods']",2008/05/31 09:00,2008/10/08 09:00,['2008/05/31 09:00'],"['2008/05/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/08 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/31 09:00 [entrez]']","['EJH1103 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-0609.2008.01103.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2008 Sep;81(3):185-95. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2008.01103.x.

We describe here different features in Foxp3 expression profile between normal and leukemic CD4(+)CD25(+) T cells, using peripheral blood samples from healthy controls (HCs), human T-cell leukemia virus type-1 (HTLV-1)-infected asymptomatic carriers (ACs), patients with adult T-cell leukemia (ATL), and various hematopoietic cell lines. The majority of CD4(+)CD25(+) T cells in HCs were positive for Foxp3, but not all CD4(+)CD25(+) T cells in ACs were positive, indicating that Foxp3 expression is not always linked to CD25 expression in normal T cells. Leukemic (ATL) T cells constitutively expressing CD25 were characteristic of heterogeneous Foxp3 expression, such as intra- and inter-case heterogeneity in intensity, inconsistency with CD25 expression, and a discrepancy in the mRNA and its protein expression. Surprisingly, a discernible amount of Foxp3 mRNA was detectable even in most cell lines without CD25 expression, a small fraction of which was positive for the Foxp3 proteins. The subcellular localization of Foxp3 in HTLV-1-infected cell lines was mainly cytoplasmic, different from that of primary ATL cells. These findings indicate that Foxp3 has two facets: essential Treg identity and molecular mimicry secondary to tumorigenesis. Conclusively, Foxp3 in normal T cells, but not mRNA, is basically potent at discriminating a subset of Treg cells from CD25(+) T-cell populations, whereas the modulation of Foxp3 expression in leukemic T cells could be implicated in oncogenesis and has a potentially useful clinical role.","['Abe, Masaki', 'Uchihashi, Kinya', 'Kazuto, Tsuruda', 'Osaka, Akemi', 'Yanagihara, Katsunori', 'Tsukasaki, Kunihiro', 'Hasegawa, Hiroo', 'Yamada, Yasuaki', 'Kamihira, Shimeru']","['Abe M', 'Uchihashi K', 'Kazuto T', 'Osaka A', 'Yanagihara K', 'Tsukasaki K', 'Hasegawa H', 'Yamada Y', 'Kamihira S']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki, Japan.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (FOXP3 protein, human)', '0 (Forkhead Transcription Factors)', '0 (Interleukin-2 Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line', 'Flow Cytometry/methods', 'Forkhead Transcription Factors/analysis/biosynthesis/*genetics', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Interleukin-2 Receptor alpha Subunit/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*immunology/virology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/*immunology/virology']",2008/05/31 09:00,2008/10/08 09:00,['2008/05/31 09:00'],"['2008/05/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/08 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/31 09:00 [entrez]']","['EJH1105 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-0609.2008.01105.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2008 Sep;81(3):209-17. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2008.01105.x.

Some TL patients die at an early age due to organ failure. Seventy DS patients with TL were studied retrospectively to identify clinical and laboratory characteristics associated with early death (<6 months of age). Sixteen of 70 patients (22.9%) died early. The main causes of death were organ failure, particularly hepatic and cardiopulmonary failure. On univariate analysis, early gestational age (EGA), high white blood cell (WBC) count (> or =100 x 10(9)/l), percentage of peripheral blasts, elevated aspartate transaminase (AST), elevated direct bilirubin (DB), and low Apgar score were significantly associated with poor survival. On multivariate analysis, EGA, WBC count, and DB were independent predictors of poor outcome. A simple risk stratification system combining EGA and WBC count was devised to predict poor outcome. Term infants (EGA > or = 37 weeks) whose WBC count was lower than 100 x 10(9)/l had the best outcome [7.7% (3/39) died early], while preterm infants (EGA < 37 weeks) whose WBC count was higher than 100 x 10(9)/l had the worst outcome [54.5% (6/11) died early]. This stratification system may be useful for identifying high-risk patients who need early therapeutic interventions.","['Muramatsu, Hideki', 'Kato, Koji', 'Watanabe, Nobuhiro', 'Matsumoto, Kimikazu', 'Nakamura, Tomohiko', 'Horikoshi, Yasuo', 'Mimaya, Junichi', 'Suzuki, Chizuko', 'Hayakawa, Masahiro', 'Kojima, Seiji']","['Muramatsu H', 'Kato K', 'Watanabe N', 'Matsumoto K', 'Nakamura T', 'Horikoshi Y', 'Mimaya J', 'Suzuki C', 'Hayakawa M', 'Kojima S']","['Department of Paediatrics, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Japanese Red Cross Nagoya First Hospital, Aichi, Japan. hidechi@ac.cyberhome.ne.jp']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,IM,"['Child, Preschool', 'Down Syndrome/blood/complications/*mortality', 'Female', 'Gestational Age', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/blood/complications/*mortality', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Analysis']",2008/05/31 09:00,2008/12/17 09:00,['2008/05/31 09:00'],"['2008/05/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/31 09:00 [entrez]']","['BJH7231 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2008.07231.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2008 Aug;142(4):610-5. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2008.07231.x.

In the present investigation, we assessed the apoptotic effect of DHA on leukemia HL60 cells and its regulation of transferrin receptor (TfR). Cell growth inhibition was assessed by Trypan blue exclusive staining; the expression of caspase-3, Bcl-2, and Bax in HL60 cells was evaluated by Western blotting; DHA-induced apoptosis was determined by AO/EB double staining, DNA fragmentation assay, and flow cytometric analysis; the expression of TfR in HL60 cells was examined by real-time PCR assays, Western blotting, and flow cytometric analysis. DHA could specifically reduce the mRNA and protein expression of TfR in HL60 cells, and the flow cytometric analysis presented the unity tendency that the TfR content decreased progressively in a dose-dependent manner. Consequently, DHA exhibited high anticancer activity in HL60 cells; MTT assay and growth inhibition assay showed that DHA could specifically inhibit the growth of HL60 cells in a dose-dependent (0.25-8 micromol/l) and time-dependent (12-72 h) manner. DHA-induced DNA fragmentation also induced the activation of caspase-3 and influenced the expression of Bcl-2 and Bax. Taken together, these data from our study show that DHA can induce HL60 cell apoptosis via the effect of downregulation TfR expression resulting in an induction of apoptosis through the mitochondrial pathway, and it might be a potential antileukemia strategy for leukemia therapy.","['Zhou, Hui-Jun', 'Wang, Zeng', 'Li, Ao']","['Zhou HJ', 'Wang Z', 'Li A']","['Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, PR China. zhouhj_zhouhj@yahoo.com']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Anticancer Drugs,Anti-cancer drugs,9100823,"['0 (Antimalarials)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Artemisinins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)', '0 (Sesquiterpenes)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '6A9O50735X (artenimol)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'I2ZWO3LS3M (Trypan Blue)']",IM,"['Antimalarials/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Artemisinins/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Caspase 3/drug effects/metabolism', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Down-Regulation/*drug effects', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Mitochondria/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/drug effects/metabolism', 'Receptors, Transferrin/*drug effects/genetics', 'Sesquiterpenes/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Staining and Labeling', 'Time Factors', 'Trypan Blue', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/drug effects/metabolism']",2008/05/31 09:00,2008/06/20 09:00,['2008/05/31 09:00'],"['2008/05/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/31 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/cad.0b013e3282f3f152 [doi]'],ppublish,Anticancer Drugs. 2008 Mar;19(3):247-55. doi: 10.1097/cad.0b013e3282f3f152.,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Five cases of extramedullary infiltration of acute monocytic leukemia/monoblastic sarcoma were selected from 102 cases of myeloid sarcoma diagnosed during the period from 1990 to 2006. The clinicopathologic findings and followup data were retrospectively analyzed. Immunohistochemical study was also carried out with SP method. RESULTS: Among the 5 cases studied, 3 were males and 2 were females, including 2 children and 3 adults. Generalized lymphadenopathy was found in 4 patients and skin lesions were observed in 2 patients. The tumor cells in all cases were positive for CD68 (KP1), CD68 (PGM1), lysozyme and CD45. They were negative for MPO, CD15, CD163, TdT, CD117, T and B cell markers. The Ki-67 index ranged from 40% to 80%. Follow-up data were available in all the 5 patients. Four of the 5 patients died of the disease, with the average survival time being 6.25 months. CONCLUSIONS: Monoblastic sarcoma is a rare disease with poor prognosis. It is almost impossible to distinguish monoblastic sarcoma from granulocytic sarcoma and other types of small round cell tumors on the basis of morphologic examination alone. Immunohistochemistry is mandatory for a correct diagnosis.","['Zuo, Zhuo', 'Lu, Wei-Ping', 'Yu, Jian-Bo', 'Li, Ji-Man', 'Liao, Dian-Ying']","['Zuo Z', 'Lu WP', 'Yu JB', 'Li JM', 'Liao DY']","['Department of Pathology, West-China Hospital of Sichuan University, Chengdu 610041, China.']",,['chi'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",China,Zhonghua Bing Li Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua bing li xue za zhi = Chinese journal of pathology,0005331,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (CD163 antigen)', '0 (CD68 antigen, human)', '0 (Lewis X Antigen)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)']",IM,"['Adult', '*Antigens, CD/immunology', '*Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/immunology', 'Child', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry/methods', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/immunology/*pathology', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens', 'Lewis X Antigen/immunology', 'Male', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/immunology', 'Sarcoma/immunology/pathology', 'Sarcoma, Myeloid/immunology/*pathology']",2008/05/31 09:00,2010/09/14 06:00,['2008/05/31 09:00'],"['2008/05/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/14 06:00 [medline]', '2008/05/31 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Bing Li Xue Za Zhi. 2008 Jan;37(1):27-30.,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In 12 NK-cell lymphomas, all nasal/extranasal lesions were FDG-avid. In nasal/maxillary areas, FDG-avid tumours were consistently more localised than on CT, suggesting that soft tissue masses on CT were partly due to inflammation. These findings have important implications in radiotherapy planning.

The localization pattern of promyelocytic leukemia (PML) protein is drastically altered during viral infection. This alteration is traditionally viewed as a viral strategy to promote viral replication. Although multiple PML splice variants exist, we demonstrate that the ratio of a subset of cytoplasmic PML isoforms lacking exons 5 & 6 is enriched in cells exposed to herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1). In particular, we demonstrate that a PML isoform lacking exons 5 & 6, called PML Ib, mediates the intrinsic cellular defense against HSV-1 via the cytoplasmic sequestration of the infected cell protein (ICP) 0 of HSV-1.

We have previously generated conditionally replication-competent MLV variants that require activation by tumour-associated proteases to become infectious. Here we analysed in a comparative study the spreading of non-targeted and of such tumour-targeted MLV variants to tumour and extratumoural organs in immunodeficient mice. Both virus types were able to efficiently infect tumour cells after systemic administration. The non-targeted virus, however, also infected extratumoural organs like bone marrow, spleen and liver efficiently. In contrast, the targeted viruses revealed in a quantitative analysis of virus spreading an up to 500-fold more selective infection of tumour tissue than the non-targeted virus.

In contrast, at low MOI, infected cells formed syncytia where only one nucleus contained virus DNA, decreasing total virus production but increasing cytotoxicity.","['Guedan, S', 'Gros, A', 'Cascallo, M', 'Vile, R', 'Mercade, E', 'Alemany, R']","['Guedan S', 'Gros A', 'Cascallo M', 'Vile R', 'Mercade E', 'Alemany R']","[""Translational Research Laboratory, IDIBELL-Institut Catala d'Oncologia, L'Hospitalet de Llobregat, Barcelona, Spain.""]",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Gene Ther,Gene therapy,9421525,['0 (Viral Fusion Proteins)'],IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic Engineering', 'Genetic Therapy/*methods', 'Genetic Vectors/*genetics', 'Giant Cells/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Gibbon Ape/genetics/*physiology', 'Oncolytic Virotherapy/*methods', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Transgenes', 'Viral Fusion Proteins/*genetics', 'Virus Replication']",2008/05/30 09:00,2008/09/16 09:00,['2008/05/30 09:00'],"['2008/05/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/16 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['gt200894 [pii]', '10.1038/gt.2008.94 [doi]']",ppublish,Gene Ther. 2008 Sep;15(17):1240-5. doi: 10.1038/gt.2008.94.

It is the product of advances in our understanding of the biology of myeloma cells, their interactions with the microenvironment and of the underlying molecular pathways. In preclinical and clinical studies, lenalidomide was more potent and less toxic than thalidomide. Subsequent phase II and III studies confirmed the activity of lenalidomide either as a single agent or in combination with dexamethasone in relapsed or refractory myeloma patients, whereas combinations with chemotherapy induce high response rates and durable remissions. Lenalidomide has been used successfully as an upfront treatment either with high or low dose dexamethasone or with melphalan and prednisone, resulting in high overall response and complete response rates and excellent 1-year survival. Lenalidomide causes less neuropathy than thalidomide; however, the risk of thromboembolism is high, especially in patients treated with lenalidomide and steroids. In this review, we summarize the mechanisms of action, toxicity and clinical activity, and the current role of lenalidomide in patients with multiple myeloma or other related plasma cell disorders.","['Dimopoulos, M A', 'Kastritis, E', 'Rajkumar, S V']","['Dimopoulos MA', 'Kastritis E', 'Rajkumar SV']","['Department of Clinical Therapeutics, University of Athens, School of Medicine, Athens, Greece. mdimop@med.uoa.gr']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Boronic Acids)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '4Z8R6ORS6L (Thalidomide)', '69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'F0P408N6V4 (Lenalidomide)']",IM,"['Amyloidosis/drug therapy', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects', 'Boronic Acids/administration & dosage', 'Bortezomib', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Dexamethasone/administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Lenalidomide', 'Multiple Myeloma/drug therapy', 'Paraproteinemias/*drug therapy', 'Pyrazines/administration & dosage', 'Renal Insufficiency/metabolism', 'Thalidomide/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Thromboembolism/chemically induced', 'Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia/drug therapy']",2008/05/30 09:00,2008/08/30 09:00,['2008/05/30 09:00'],"['2008/05/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/30 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['leu2008123 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2008.123 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2008 Jul;22(7):1343-53. doi: 10.1038/leu.2008.123.

It would therefore be useful to identify therapeutic agents that target leukaemic stem cells. We devised a flow cytometric chemosensitivity assay allowing 48 h culture of leukaemic blasts in a defined microenvironment followed by enumeration of viable CD34+CD38-CD123+ leukaemic stem and progenitor cells (LSPC). The assay was used to investigate the LSPC response to cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C) and to the FLT3 inhibitor AG1296. There was a 3.6-fold increase in Ara-C-treated LSPC survival under defined 'niche-like' conditions compared to culture without microenvironmental support. Nine AML samples with internal tandem duplications of FLT3 (FLT3/ITDs) were treated with AG1296. Three samples were very sensitive (>50% kill) and 4 were moderately sensitive (10-50% kill) in bulk suspension culture without microenvironmental support. However, under defined 'niche-like' conditions, the survival of LSPC was enhanced rather than inhibited by AG1296 treatment. We conclude that an interaction between LSPC and a defined in vitro microenvironment models a chemoresistant niche. Our data point to a need to investigate more novel chemotherapeutic agents under these stringent conditions to identify agents that may be suitable to target minimal residual disease in AML.","['Mony, U', 'Jawad, M', 'Seedhouse, C', 'Russell, N', 'Pallis, M']","['Mony U', 'Jawad M', 'Seedhouse C', 'Russell N', 'Pallis M']","['Division of Haematology, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, UK.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (IL3RA protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-3 Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-3)', '0 (Tyrphostins)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '146535-11-7 (6,7-dimethoxy-3-phenylquinoxaline)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (CD38 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/analysis', 'Antigens, CD34/analysis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3 Receptor alpha Subunit/analysis', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/analysis', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects', 'Phenotype', 'Receptors, Interleukin-3/analysis', 'Tyrphostins/*pharmacology', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics']",2008/05/30 09:00,2008/08/30 09:00,['2008/05/30 09:00'],"['2008/05/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/30 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['leu2008125 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2008.125 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2008 Jul;22(7):1395-401. doi: 10.1038/leu.2008.125.

In this report, we describe the existence of an autocrine stimulatory loop involving interleukin-22 (IL-22) that contributes to STAT3 activation and tumorigenicity of ALK(+)ALCL. The IL-22 receptor, a heterodimer composed of IL-22R1 and IL-10R2, was expressed in all ALK(+)ALCL cell lines and tumors examined. The expression of IL-22R1 in ALK(+)ALCL is aberrant, as this protein is absent in benign lymphocytes. Although ALK(+)ALCL cells produce endogenous IL-22, addition of recombinant IL-22 to ALK(+)ALCL cell lines significantly increased STAT3 activation, cell proliferation and colony formation in soft agar. Opposite biological effects were observed in cells treated with recombinant IL-22 binding protein (a naturally occurring IL-22 decoy) or IL-22-neutralizing antibody. Nucleophosmin (NPM)-ALK, the characteristic fusion gene oncoprotein expressed in ALK(+)ALCL, directly contributes to the aberrant expression of IL-22R1, as transfection of NPM-ALK in Jurkat cells-induced IL-22R1 expression and IL-22-mediated STAT3 activation. To conclude, for the first time, we demonstrate the importance of the IL-22 autocrine pathway in a lymphoid malignancy, and reveal yet another novel function of NPM-ALK.","['Bard, J Dien', 'Gelebart, P', 'Anand, M', 'Amin, H M', 'Lai, R']","['Bard JD', 'Gelebart P', 'Anand M', 'Amin HM', 'Lai R']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Cross Cancer Institute, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Interleukins)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (interleukin-22 receptor)', 'XEO71E2E45 (interleukin-22)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'DNA Primers', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Humans', 'Interleukins/metabolism/*physiology', 'Lymphoma, Large-Cell, Anaplastic/genetics/*pathology', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'Receptors, Interleukin/*genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction']",2008/05/30 09:00,2008/09/13 09:00,['2008/05/30 09:00'],"['2008/05/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/13 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['leu2008129 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2008.129 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2008 Aug;22(8):1595-603. doi: 10.1038/leu.2008.129.

However, whether rMLL-related leukemogenesis is inextricably linked to drug cytotoxicity remains controversial. We therefore compared (i) rMLL in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who developed t-AML and those who did not, (ii) epipodophyllotoxin toxicity in patients with t-AML and in controls, and (iii) rMLL in cells sensitive to etoposide and in those resistant to etoposide. In children with ALL, rMLL appeared to be more frequent in children who developed t-AML than in those who did not (seven pairs, P = 0.04), although independent of the cumulative etoposide dose (P = 0.5). Similarly, the frequency of epipodophyllotoxin-related toxicities did not differ between patients with t-AML and controls (26 pairs, P > 0.17). Moreover, in 25 cell lines, etoposide-induced MLL fusions did not differ in sensitive vs. resistant lines at equitoxic concentrations (P = 0.65). Together, these results indicate that epipodophyllotoxin-mediated leukemogenesis is not directly linked to drug cytotoxicity.","['Yang, J', 'Bogni, A', 'Cheng, C', 'Bleibel, W K', 'Cai, X', 'Fan, Y', 'Yang, W', 'Rocha, J C C', 'Pei, D', 'Liu, W', 'Dolan, M E', 'Pui, C-H', 'Relling, M V']","['Yang J', 'Bogni A', 'Cheng C', 'Bleibel WK', 'Cai X', 'Fan Y', 'Yang W', 'Rocha JC', 'Pei D', 'Liu W', 'Dolan ME', 'Pui CH', 'Relling MV']","[""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee, USA.""]",,['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Clin Pharmacol Ther,Clinical pharmacology and therapeutics,0372741,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Drug Hypersensitivity', 'Etoposide/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*chemically induced/physiopathology', 'Male', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*drug effects/genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Reference Values', 'Risk Assessment']",2008/05/30 09:00,2008/12/17 09:00,['2008/05/30 09:00'],"['2008/05/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['clpt200886 [pii]', '10.1038/clpt.2008.86 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Pharmacol Ther. 2008 Dec;84(6):691-7. doi: 10.1038/clpt.2008.86.

This study examines racial differences in clinical outcomes in the setting of two large cooperative group randomized clinical trials. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study cohort consisted of 787 white (80%) and 195 African American (20%) patients with metastatic breast cancer enrolled in two successive Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) trials using taxanes in the metastatic setting. Differences in overall survival (OS), response incidence, and time to treatment failure (TTF) were examined by race. In addition, differences in the incidence of baseline and treatment-related toxicities were examined. RESULTS: With 779 deaths (166 African Americans and 613 whites), median OS was 14.3 months for African Americans and 18.75 months for whites (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.37; 95% CI, 1.15 to 1.63). When adjusted for prognostic factors, African Americans had a 24% increase in the hazard of death compared with whites (HR = 1.24; 95% CI, 1.02 to 1.51). No significant differences in TTF or overall response to therapy were seen. No clinically significant toxicity differences were seen. CONCLUSION: African Americans with metastatic breast cancer have an increased hazard of death compared with whites despite the receipt of similar per-protocol treatment, but experience no differences in TTF or overall response to therapy. We hypothesize that more direct and robust measures of comorbidities, and perhaps other factors such as receipt of subsequent therapy could help further explain the observed survival difference.","['Polite, Blase N', 'Cirrincione, Constance', 'Fleming, Gini F', 'Berry, Donald A', 'Seidman, Andrew', 'Muss, Hyman', 'Norton, Larry', 'Shapiro, Charles', 'Bakri, Kamal', 'Marcom, Kelly', 'Lake, Diana', 'Schwartz, Joel H', 'Hudis, Clifford', 'Winer, Eric P']","['Polite BN', 'Cirrincione C', 'Fleming GF', 'Berry DA', 'Seidman A', 'Muss H', 'Norton L', 'Shapiro C', 'Bakri K', 'Marcom K', 'Lake D', 'Schwartz JH', 'Hudis C', 'Winer EP']","['The University of Chicago Medical Center, 5841 South Maryland Ave, MC 2115, Chicago, IL 60637-1470, USA. bpolite@medicine.bsd.uchicago.edu']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)']",IM,"['Adult', '*African Americans', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/therapeutic use', 'Breast Neoplasms/drug therapy/ethnology/*mortality', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Logistic Models', 'Middle Aged', 'Multicenter Studies as Topic', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Paclitaxel/therapeutic use', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', '*Survival Analysis', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Failure', '*Whites']",2008/05/30 09:00,2008/06/26 09:00,['2008/05/30 09:00'],"['2008/05/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/26 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['26/16/2659 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2007.13.9782 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2008 Jun 1;26(16):2659-65. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2007.13.9782.,16,,,"['CA33601/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA077658/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA32291/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA035421/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA045418/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA077440/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA041287/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180882/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA47559/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA047642/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA003927/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA047577/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA032291/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA77406/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA47577/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA045564/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA41287/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA035279/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA045808/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA77651/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA033601/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA045389/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180821/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA077597/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA047559/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA077651/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA074811/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA77658/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC4830463,['NIHMS548559'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Herpesviruses express proteins that modulate PML or PML-associated proteins by a variety of strategies, including degradation of PML or relocalization of PML NB proteins. The consequences of PML-herpesvirus interactions during infection in vivo have yet to be investigated in detail, largely because of the species-specific tropism of many human herpesviruses. Murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (gammaHV68) is emerging as a suitable model to study basic biological questions of virus-host interactions because it naturally infects mice. Therefore, we sought to determine whether gammaHV68 targets PML NBs as part of its natural life cycle. We found that gammaHV68 induces PML degradation through a proteasome-dependent mechanism and that loss of PML results in more robust virus replication in mouse fibroblasts. Surprisingly, gammaHV68-mediated PML degradation was mediated by the virion tegument protein ORF75c, which shares homology with the cellular formylglycinamide ribotide amidotransferase enzyme. In addition, we show that ORF75c is essential for production of infectious virus. ORF75 homologs are conserved in all rhadinoviruses but so far have no assigned functions. Our studies shed light on a potential role for this unusual protein in rhadinovirus biology and suggest that gammaHV68 will be a useful model for investigation of PML-herpesvirus interactions in vivo.","['Ling, Paul D', 'Tan, Jie', 'Sewatanon, Jaturong', 'Peng, RongSheng']","['Ling PD', 'Tan J', 'Sewatanon J', 'Peng R']","['Department of Molecular Virology and Microbiology, Baylor College of Medicine, Mail Stop BCM-385, One Baylor Plaza, Houston, Texas 77030, USA. pling@bcm.edu']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Nuclear Proteins)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",IM,"['Alleles', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Fibroblasts/metabolism/virology', 'Gammaherpesvirinae/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/metabolism', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid']",2008/05/30 09:00,2008/09/03 09:00,['2008/05/30 09:00'],"['2008/05/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/03 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['JVI.02752-07 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.02752-07 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2008 Aug;82(16):8000-12. doi: 10.1128/JVI.02752-07.

Indeed, kinetic analysis showed that, as observed with MuLV RT, PFV RT exhibits approximately 10 to 80 times lower dNTP binding affinity than HIV-1 RT.

The GIMEMA experience.,1025-32,10.3324/haematol.11889 [doi],"BACKGROUND: Myelomonocytic acute myeloid leukemia (M4-AML) is frequently associated with the cytogenetic marker inv(16) and/or the presence of eosinophilia. The aim of this study was to analyze the incidence and prognostic role of these factors in a large series of patients. DESIGN AND METHODS: Adult patients with acute myeloid leukemia consecutively enrolled in the GIMEMA trials AML10 and LAM99p were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: Among 1686 patients, 400 cases of M4-AML were identified; of these, 78% had neither eosinophilia nor inv(16), 6% had eosinophilia only, 8% had inv(16) only and 8% had both. Univariate analysis showed that both eosinophilia and inv(16) were correlated with a higher probability of complete remission, lower resistance to chemotherapy and increased overall survival. Multivariate analysis showed that the simultaneous presence of the two factors significantly increased the probabilities of both complete remission and overall survival. The presence of only one of the two factors also increased the probabilities of complete remission and overall survival, but not to a statistically significant extent. The relapse-free survival of the responding patients was not influenced by the two factors. CONCLUSIONS: In a large series of patients with M4-AML we confirmed the favorable role of inv(16), but the weight of this factor among the whole M4 population was of limited relevance. Eosinophilia, which affects a small proportion of cases, also emerged as a favorable prognostic factor.

The aim of this study was to verify this prospectively in a large group of patients. DESIGN AND METHODS: Genetic characterization was prospectively carried out in 397 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (median age, 46 years) receiving uniform treatment according to the LAM99P protocol of the Italian GIMEMA group. The impact of genetic markers on response to therapy and outcome was assessed by univariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS: For induction response, conventional karyotyping identified three groups with complete remission rates of 92%, 67% and 39% (p<0.0001). Complete remission rates in NPM1 mutated (NPM1+) and wild-type (NPM1-) groups were 76% and 60%, respectively, for the whole population and 81% and 61% in the group with normal karyotype (p<0.001 and p=0.026, respectively). Multivariate analysis indicated that low risk karyotype and NPM1+ were independent factors favorably affecting complete remission. Multivariate analysis of overall and disease-free survival among 269 patients who achieved complete remission showed a significant impact of karyotype on both estimates and of FLT3 status on disease free-survival (FLT3-ITD vs. FLT3 wild-type, p=0.0001). NPM1 status did not significantly influence disease free-survival in either the whole population or in the patients with a normal karyotype in this series, probably due to the low number of cases analyzed. CONCLUSIONS: These results reiterate the prognostic relevance of combining cytogenetic and mutational analysis in the diagnostic work up of patients with acute myeloid leukemia.","['Lo-Coco, Francesco', 'Cuneo, Antonio', 'Pane, Fabrizio', 'Cilloni, Daniela', 'Diverio, Daniela', 'Mancini, Marco', 'Testoni, Nicoletta', 'Bardi, Antonella', 'Izzo, Barbara', 'Bolli, Niccolo', 'La Starza, Roberta', 'Fazi, Paola', 'Iacobelli, Simona', 'Piciocchi, Alfonso', 'Vignetti, Marco', 'Amadori, Sergio', 'Mandelli, Franco', 'Pelicci, Pier Giuseppe', 'Mecucci, Cristina', 'Falini, Brunangelo', 'Saglio, Giuseppe']","['Lo-Coco F', 'Cuneo A', 'Pane F', 'Cilloni D', 'Diverio D', 'Mancini M', 'Testoni N', 'Bardi A', 'Izzo B', 'Bolli N', 'La Starza R', 'Fazi P', 'Iacobelli S', 'Piciocchi A', 'Vignetti M', 'Amadori S', 'Mandelli F', 'Pelicci PG', 'Mecucci C', 'Falini B', 'Saglio G']","['Department of Biopathology, University Tor Vergata, via Montpellier 1, 00161 Rome, Italy. francesco.lo.coco@uniroma2.it']",['Acute Leukemia Working Party of the GIMEMA group'],['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Genetic Markers)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Cytogenetics', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Genetic Markers', 'Humans', 'Italy', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/*genetics/therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Mutation', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Remission Induction']",2008/05/30 09:00,2008/10/10 09:00,['2008/05/30 09:00'],"['2008/05/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/10 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.12004 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.12004 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2008 Jul;93(7):1017-24. doi: 10.3324/haematol.12004.

Single nucleotide polymorphism array analysis has been shown to detect not only gene deletions but also regions of uniparental disomy that can pinpoint particular regions for mutation analysis. DESIGN AND METHODS: We studied 42 cases of myelodysplastic syndrome with del(5q), comprising 21 patients with 5q- syndrome and 21 with del(5q) (not 5q- syndrome), and 45 healthy controls by genome wide single nucleotide polymorphism analysis with the 50K Affymetrix single nucleotide polymorphism arrays. RESULTS: The del(5q) was characterized in all cases. The commonly deleted region of the 5q- syndrome extends between the genes SH3TC2 (proximal boundary) and GLRA1 (distal boundary) and measures 2.9 Mb. Copy number changes in addition to the del(5q) were observed in 10 of 21 patients with del(5q) myelodysplastic syndrome but in none of the patients with the 5q- syndrome. A total of 63 regions of uniparental disomy greater than 2 Mb were detected in 40 of 42 patients, dispersed on 18/23 chromosomes. In the 5q- syndrome group 31 regions of uniparental disomy were identified in 19 of 21 patients, the largest one being 7.6 Mb. All 21 patients with del(5q) myelodysplastic syndrome had uniparental disomy; in total 32 regions of uniparental disomy were identified in the 21 patients, including six regions of uniparental disomy > 10 Mb. Eight recurrent regions of uniparental disomy were observed among the 42 patients. For eight patients we had T-cell DNA as a germline control and four recurrent regions of uniparental disomy were identified that were present only in the neutrophil and not T-cell DNA. One small region of uniparental disomy at 10p12.31-p12.2 was observed in four patients with the 5q- syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that regions of uniparental disomy greater than 2 Mb are found in the 5q-syndrome and del(5q) myelodysplastic syndrome, although large regions of uniparental disomy (>10 Mb) are only found in the latter group. The recurrent regions of uniparental disomy may indicate the position of novel leukemia-associated genes.","['Wang, Li', 'Fidler, Carrie', 'Nadig, Nandita', 'Giagounidis, Aristoteles', 'Della Porta, Matteo G', 'Malcovati, Luca', 'Killick, Sally', 'Gattermann, Norbert', 'Aul, Carlo', 'Boultwood, Jacqueline', 'Wainscoat, James S']","['Wang L', 'Fidler C', 'Nadig N', 'Giagounidis A', 'Della Porta MG', 'Malcovati L', 'Killick S', 'Gattermann N', 'Aul C', 'Boultwood J', 'Wainscoat JS']","['LRF Molecular Haematology Unit, Nuffield Department of Clinical, Laboratory Sciences, University of Oxford, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford OX3 9DU, UK.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Case-Control Studies', '*Chromosome Deletion', 'Female', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genome, Human', 'Humans', '*Loss of Heterozygosity', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Uniparental Disomy/genetics']",2008/05/30 09:00,2008/10/10 09:00,['2008/05/30 09:00'],"['2008/05/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/10 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.12603 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.12603 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2008 Jul;93(7):994-1000. doi: 10.3324/haematol.12603.

The complex arrangement, regulation and co-factor association of HOX has been an area of intense research, particularly in cancer biology, for over a decade. The concept of redeployment of embryonic regulators in the neoplastic arena has received support from many quarters. Observations of altered HOX gene expression in various solid tumours and leukemia appear to support the thesis that 'oncology recapitulates ontogeny' but the identification of critical HOX subsets and their functional role in cancer onset and maintenance requires further investigation. The application of novel techniques and model systems will continue to enhance our understanding of the HOX network in the years to come. Better understanding of the intricacy of the complex as well as identification of functional pathways and direct targets of the encoded proteins will permit harnessing of this family of genes for clinical application.","['McGonigle, Glenda J', 'Lappin, Terence R J', 'Thompson, Alexander']","['McGonigle GJ', 'Lappin TR', 'Thompson A']","[""Haematology, Centre for Cancer Research and Cell Biology, Queen's University Belfast, 97 Lisburn Road, Belfast, BT9 7BL.""]",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Front Biosci,Frontiers in bioscience : a journal and virtual library,9709506,,IM,"['Animals', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Evolution, Molecular', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', '*Genes, Homeobox', 'Hematopoiesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/classification/*genetics/physiopathology', 'Mammals', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Translocation, Genetic']",2008/05/30 09:00,2008/09/20 09:00,['2008/05/30 09:00'],"['2008/05/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/20 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['3006 [pii]', '10.2741/3006 [doi]']",epublish,Front Biosci. 2008 May 1;13:4297-308. doi: 10.2741/3006.,,128,,,20080501,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In recent years, inhibition of proteasome function has emerged as a novel anti-cancer therapy.

Bortezomib is the first proteasome inhibitor to be used clinically and a second generation of proteasome inhibitors with differential pharmacological properties are currently in early clinical trials. This review summarises the development of proteasome inhibitors as therapeutic agents and describes how novel assays for measuring proteasome activity and inhibition may help to further delineate the mechanisms of action of different proteasome inhibitors. This will allow for the optimized use of proteasome inhibitors in combination therapies and provide the opportunity to design more potent and therapeutically efficacious proteasome inhibitors.","['Crawford, Lisa Judith-Ann', 'Walker, Brian', 'Irvine, Alexandra Elizabeth']","['Crawford LJ', 'Walker B', 'Irvine AE']","[""Haematology, Centre for Cancer Research and Cell Biology, Queen's University Belfast, 97 Lisburn Road, Belfast, BT9 7BL.""]",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Front Biosci,Frontiers in bioscience : a journal and virtual library,9709506,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Boronic Acids)', '0 (Protease Inhibitors)', '0 (Proteasome Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '0 (Ubiquitin)', '69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)', 'EC 3.4.99.- (ATP dependent 26S protease)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Boronic Acids/therapeutic use', 'Bortezomib', 'Cell Nucleus/enzymology', 'Cytoplasm/enzymology', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy', 'Protease Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex', '*Proteasome Inhibitors', 'Pyrazines/therapeutic use', 'Ubiquitin/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism']",2008/05/30 09:00,2008/09/20 09:00,['2008/05/30 09:00'],"['2008/05/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/20 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['3005 [pii]', '10.2741/3005 [doi]']",epublish,Front Biosci. 2008 May 1;13:4285-96. doi: 10.2741/3005.,,77,,,20080501,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Results from cell proliferation assays showed that AAQ caused significant decrease in cell number in a dose-dependent manner. The cell death induced by AAQ appeared to involve apoptosis, based on evidence from apoptotic DNA fragmentation, flow cytometry, fluorescence microscopy, and Western blot analyses.

To validate the ethnopharmacological claims against cancer, the anticancer effects of alcoholic extracts prepared from pond apple leaves, pulp and seed, were investigated in human leukemia cell lines. The alcoholic extracts were not cytotoxic to normal human lymphocytes. However, extracts were highly cytotoxic to drug sensitive (CEM) and multidrug-resistant leukemia (CEM/VLB) cell lines. The seed extract was more potent than leaf and pulp extracts, and the cytotoxicity values were significantly lower than that for adriamycin. The seed extract caused a concentration-dependent increase in the percentage of the sub G0/G1, as well as G0/G1 cell population, contributing to the cytotoxicity. The sub G0/G1 population increased from 2.2 to 7.0% in CEM and from 1.0 to 10.7% in CEM/VLB cell lines, when the cells were treated with 0-10 Bg/ml seed extract. Treatment of CEM and CEM/VLB cells with seed extract induced apoptosis and necrosis in both sensitive and resistant leukemia cells in a concentration-dependent manner. The seed extract at 2 and 5 Bg/ml enhanced cellular daunorubicin accumulation, indicating the competitive P-glycoprotein binding ability and drug-resistance reversal effect. Treatment of CEM and CEM/VLB cells with seed extracts also up-regulated the expression of cyclin kinase inhibitor (WAF1/p21) contributing to the arrest of cells at the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle. These results support the traditional use of A. glabra and the alcoholic seed extract is a potent source of anticancer compounds that could be utilized pharmaceutically.","['Cochrane, Curtis Bruce', 'Nair, P K Raveendran', 'Melnick, Steven J', 'Resek, Anna P', 'Ramachandran, Cheppail']","['Cochrane CB', 'Nair PK', 'Melnick SJ', 'Resek AP', 'Ramachandran C']","[""Department of Pathology, Miami Children's Hospital, Miami, FL 33155, USA.""]",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Validation Study']",Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Annona/*chemistry', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Daunorubicin/pharmacokinetics', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Phytotherapy', 'Plant Extracts/*therapeutic use']",2008/05/30 09:00,2008/06/19 09:00,['2008/05/30 09:00'],"['2008/05/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/19 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/30 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2008 Mar-Apr;28(2A):965-71.,2A,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL/Apo2L) is of great interest since it has been shown to predominantly kill cancer cells without toxic effects on normal counterparts, thus representing a promising anticancer agent. However, resistance towards TRAIL/Apo2L treatment has also been described. To overcome this obstacle, co-administration of TRAIL/Apo2L plus several compounds, including histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi), has been attempted as a strategy to restore cancer cell sensitivity to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. In recent years, the clinical application of HDACi has been largely explored for their ability to modulate gene transcription, block cell division cycle, inhibit cell proliferation, induce cellular differentiation and apoptosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The ability of valproic acid (VPA), a well-known HDACi, to sensitise the K562 cell line, derived from a human leukemia, to TRAIL/Apo2L-mediated apoptosis was evaluated. VPA was selected since it is currently used in clinical practice and its pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic and bioavailability are known. RESULTS: When applied with TRAIL/Apo2L, VPA increased cell death and caspase-3 activity by 4-fold compared to the treatment with TRAIL/Apo2L alone. VPA sensitized K562 cells to TRAIL/Apo2L-mediated apoptosis by increasing the expression of DR4 and DR5 by 3- and 14-fold respectively. In addition, VPA per se, in the absence of TRAIL/Apo2L, reduced the expression of antiapoptotic factors, such as c-FLPs, associated with DISC, and Bcl-2/Bcl-X(L), associated with mitochondria, acting on both extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrated the ability of VPA to sensitize TRAIL/Apo2L-resistant cells to apoptosis, thus providing an attractive approach for the treatment of leukemias and other proliferative malignancies.","['Iacomino, Giuseppe', 'Medici, Maria Cristina', 'Russo, Gian Luigi']","['Iacomino G', 'Medici MC', 'Russo GL']","['Institute of Food Sciences, National Research Council, Avellino, Italy. piacomino@isa.cnr.it']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '614OI1Z5WI (Valproic Acid)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*pathology', 'Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/metabolism', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/*pharmacology', 'Valproic Acid/*pharmacology']",2008/05/30 09:00,2008/06/19 09:00,['2008/05/30 09:00'],"['2008/05/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/19 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/30 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2008 Mar-Apr;28(2A):855-64.,2A,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous studies had shown that deoxyadenosine-resistant L1210 cells (Y8) proceeded to apoptosis under conditions in which the parental L1210 cell line (WT) did not undergo an apoptotic response. Combinations of drugs, acting at different molecular targets, markedly potentiated the apoptotic response in the Y8 cells without inducing apoptosis in the WT cells. In the present study, induction of apoptosis by parthenolide and BAY 11-7085, drugs that targeted nuclear factor kappa B activation, was blocked by the presence of N-acetylcysteine (NAC). On the other hand, the levels of apoptosis induced by parthenolide or BAY 11-7085 were increased by pre-treatment of the cells with glutathione lowering L-buthionine-(S,R)-sulfoximine (BSO). Western blot analyses showed that the levels of the stress proteins, Grp 78 and Gadd 153 were reduced in the parthenolide-treated Y8 cells, but not in those co-treated with NAC. Protection of the cells from apoptosis induced by parthenolide or BAY 11-7085 by NAC was relatively specific as the induction of apoptosis in the Y8 cells by MG-132, flavopiridol, Gemcitabine or PRIMA-1 was not decreased by NAC. These data suggest that multiple pathways, one of which is ER-stress induced, may ultimately be involved and interactive in the induction of apoptosis in specific cell lines.","['Cory, Ann H', 'Chen, Jianming', 'Cory, Joseph G']","['Cory AH', 'Chen J', 'Cory JG']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Brody School of Medicine, East Carolina University, Greenville, NC 27834, USA.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (BAY 11-7085)', '0 (Ddit3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Deoxyadenosines)', '0 (Endoplasmic Reticulum Chaperone BiP)', '0 (Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Molecular Chaperones)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Sesquiterpenes)', '0 (Sulfones)', '147336-12-7 (Transcription Factor CHOP)', '2RDB26I5ZB (parthenolide)', '5072-26-4 (Buthionine Sulfoximine)', 'WYQ7N0BPYC (Acetylcysteine)']",IM,"['Acetylcysteine/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Buthionine Sulfoximine/pharmacology', 'Deoxyadenosines/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum/*metabolism', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum Chaperone BiP', 'Heat-Shock Proteins/*metabolism', 'Leukemia L1210', 'Molecular Chaperones/metabolism', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Nitriles/*pharmacology', 'Sesquiterpenes/*pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sulfones/*pharmacology', 'Transcription Factor CHOP/metabolism']",2008/05/30 09:00,2008/06/19 09:00,['2008/05/30 09:00'],"['2008/05/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/19 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/30 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2008 Mar-Apr;28(2A):681-6.,2A,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PROCEDURE: Between January 1998 and October 2004, 346 newly diagnosed ALL patients <or=16 years were admitted to our hospital. Of these, 248 patients received modified National Protocol of Childhood ALL in China 1997 (NPCAC97) for at least 2 weeks of treatment and were eligible for protocol evaluation. RESULTS: Among the 346 newly diagnosed patients, 167 (48.3%) stopped treatment either at diagnosis or during therapy. The abandonment rates for urban area group (UAG) and rural area group (RAG) were 25.3% and 57.3%, respectively (P < 0.0001). The 5-year event-free survival (EFS) rate for the entire cohort was 38.5 +/- 2.7%. For 248 evaluable patients, the remission rate was 97.2%. The 5-year EFS and overall survival (OS) rates were 70.7 +/- 3.6% and 82.1 +/- 3.0%, respectively. The 5-year EFS for standard-risk group (n = 196) was significantly higher than that of high-risk group (n = 52) (75.9 +/- 3.9% vs. 50.7 +/- 8.0%, P = 0.0002). Prognostic factor analysis showed that poor response to remission induction therapy and a poor socioeconomic status were predictive for an inferior outcome. CONCLUSION: Abandonment of chemotherapy was the most common cause of treatment failure, which was strongly related to poor socioeconomic status and financial support. For patients who could adhere to the treatment protocol, a relatively good outcome was achieved.","['Tang, Yongmin', 'Xu, Xiaojun', 'Song, Hua', 'Yang, Shilong', 'Shi, Shuwen', 'Wei, Jian']","['Tang Y', 'Xu X', 'Song H', 'Yang S', 'Shi S', 'Wei J']","[""Division of Hematology-Oncology, Children's Hospital Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, PR China. y_m_tang@zju.edu.cn""]",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'China', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/mortality/*therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Social Class', 'Survival Analysis', '*Treatment Failure', 'Treatment Outcome', '*Treatment Refusal']",2008/05/29 09:00,2008/08/14 09:00,['2008/05/29 09:00'],"['2008/05/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/14 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/29 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.21629 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2008 Sep;51(3):380-6. doi: 10.1002/pbc.21629.,3,,,,,,,"['(c) 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

An important molecular mechanism responsible for the observed cytokine profiles by CKS-17 is provided by our findings demonstrating that this small peptide activates several intracellular signaling molecules, i.e., elevates intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels, and induces phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1 and 2, mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase (MEK), protein kinase D, Raf1, and phospholipase C gamma1 (PLCgamma1). The activation of ERK1/2 is via the PLCgamma1-protein kinase C-Raf1-MEK signaling cascade. The activation of both ERK1/2 and cAMP appears to be via a mechanism sensitive to AG879, a receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, but not to AG825, AG1296, or AG1478. Furthermore, phosphoinositide-3 kinase appears to mediate the CKS-17-induced activation of ERK1/2, but not of cAMP. A specific amino acid sequence as well as the dimerization of this peptide is required to confer these biological activities. The results obtained are compelling and reproducible. This highly conserved molecule may enable us to understand a basic mechanism(s) of intracellular signaling pathways, regulation of Th1/Th2 cytokines, immunosuppression, and immunologic tolerance.","['Haraguchi, Soichi', 'Good, Robert A', 'Day-Good, Noorbibi K']","['Haraguchi S', 'Good RA', 'Day-Good NK']","[""Division of Allergy, Immunology, and Rheumatology, Department of Pediatrics, University of South Florida, Children's Research Institute, 140 Seventh Avenue South, CRI 4008, St. Petersburg, FL 33701, USA. sharaguc@health.usf.edu""]",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Immunol Res,Immunologic research,8611087,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (p15E protein, Murine leukemia virus)', '99273-04-8 (CKS 17)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Immune Tolerance', 'Immunosuppression Therapy', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/drug effects/immunology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Peptides/genetics/*immunology/pharmacology', 'Retroviridae', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/genetics', 'Second Messenger Systems/drug effects/immunology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/*immunology', 'Th1 Cells/drug effects/*immunology', 'Th2 Cells/drug effects/*immunology', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/genetics']",2008/05/29 09:00,2008/08/20 09:00,['2008/05/29 09:00'],"['2008/05/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/20 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/29 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s12026-007-0039-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Immunol Res. 2008;41(1):46-55. doi: 10.1007/s12026-007-0039-6.,1,55,,['R01 CA40931-07/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Effects on differentiation were assessed through monitoring morphological changes and Western blot analysis of the expression of neuronal marker proteins. In contrast to PACAP-38, which induced a 5.5-fold increase in the number of neurite-bearing cells, LIF had no significant effect on cell morphology compared to control cells over the 4-day time course. Cells co-treated with PACAP-38+LIF showed a similar increase in neurite-bearing cells compared to those treated with PACAP-38 alone. Cell morphology was similar for PACAP-38-treated and PACAP-38+LIF-co-treated cells, with the formation of bipolar neuron-like cells with long thin neurites, topped by growth cone-like structures and varicosities. SH-SY5Y cells express tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) but only low levels of the neuronal marker proteins: Bcl-2, GAP-43 and choline acetyltransferase (ChAT). Treatment of cells with PACAP-38 induced the expression of Bcl-2, GAP-43, and ChAT but did not appear to alter the expression of TH. LIF failed to induce the expression of GAP-43 and had little effect on the expression of TH, but did induce the expression of Bcl-2 and upregulated the expression of ChAT. Co-treatment with LIF had no effect on PACAP-38-induced expression of Bcl-2, GAP-43, and ChAT. Cells differentiated for 4 days with PACAP-38 or treated with LIF also displayed increased resistance to hypoxic conditions and to treatment with H2O2 and TNFalpha. The increased resistance to hypoxic conditions for PACAP-differentiated cells was blocked by the p38 MAP kinase inhibitor, SB203580, but not by the MEK1 inhibitor, PD98059. Additionally, cell proliferation assays show that LIF, but not PACAP-38, stimulates proliferation of SH-SY5Y cells, and this observed increase by LIF is not attenuated by co-treatment with PACAP. Further investigation of the intracellular signaling pathways mediating the neurotrophic effects of PACAP on SH-SY5Y cells indicate that neither phospholipase C activation nor Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CAMKII) are involved.","['Monaghan, T K', 'Pou, C', 'MacKenzie, C J', 'Plevin, R', 'Lutz, E M']","['Monaghan TK', 'Pou C', 'MacKenzie CJ', 'Plevin R', 'Lutz EM']","['Strathclyde Institute of Pharmacy and Biomedical Sciences, Royal College, 204 George Street, Glasgow, G1 1XW, UK.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Mol Neurosci,Journal of molecular neuroscience : MN,9002991,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Nerve Growth Factors)', '0 (Pituitary Adenylate Cyclase-Activating Polypeptide)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', '0 (Receptors, Pituitary Adenylate Cyclase-Activating Polypeptide, Type I)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinase Type 2)', 'EC 3.1.4.- (Type C Phospholipases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biomarkers/metabolism', 'Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinase Type 2/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Shape', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*pharmacology', 'Nerve Growth Factors/*pharmacology', 'Neuroblastoma', 'Pituitary Adenylate Cyclase-Activating Polypeptide/*pharmacology', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Pituitary Adenylate Cyclase-Activating Polypeptide, Type I/genetics/metabolism', 'Type C Phospholipases/metabolism']",2008/05/29 09:00,2009/02/20 09:00,['2008/05/29 09:00'],"['2008/02/22 00:00 [received]', '2008/03/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/05/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/02/20 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/29 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s12031-008-9082-6 [doi]'],ppublish,J Mol Neurosci. 2008 Nov;36(1-3):45-56. doi: 10.1007/s12031-008-9082-6.

It is unlikely that improvements in outcome can be achieved by further intensification of conventional chemotherapy. Instead, advances in the treatment of children with AML will require a greater understanding of the biology of the disease, with particular attention to the genetic abnormalities underlying leukemogenesis and drug resistance. Future clinical trials should include refined risk-directed therapy based on the genetics of the leukemic blasts and the patient's response to therapy. More important, we must develop alternative treatment approaches, such as agents that target specific leukemia-associated abnormalities and agents that selectively eradicate leukemic stem cells.","['Rubnitz, Jeffrey E']",['Rubnitz JE'],"[""Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, 332 N.

Computed tomography imaging revealed fullness of the pancreatic head and multiple enlarged retroperitoneal lymph nodes. Cholangiogram revealed a distal common bile duct stricture. Due to concerns of malignancy, the patient underwent operative exploration. Several enlarged lymph nodes in the aortocaval region and a firm hard mass in the pancreatic head were found. Frozen section from one of the lymph nodes was suspicious for low-grade lymphoma. A pancreaticoduodenectomy was performed. Histologic analysis of the pancreatic head revealed a lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate with stromal fibrosis consistent with autoimmune pancreatitis. The retroperitoneal lymph nodes were involved by small lymphocytic lymphoma. DISCUSSION: Autoimmune pancreatitis is the most common benign diagnosis after pancreatic resection for presumed malignancy. It has a well-documented association with autoimmune conditions, such as Sjogren's syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, and sclerosing cholangitis. Additionally, chronic lymphocytic leukemia-small lymphocytic lymphoma is often associated with autoimmune phenomena, most notably autoimmune hemolytic anemia. However, an association between autoimmune pancreatitis and small lymphocytic lymphoma has not been previously described.

METHODS: Retrospective analysis of medical records from patients with final diagnosis of neoplasia attended at the ""Unidade de Reumatologia do Instituto da Crianca - FMUSP"" between January 1983 and December 2006. Data on musculoskeletal complaints, clinical examination, laboratory tests, radiological studies and diagnostic procedures were obtained. RESULTS: From 4876 patients, 25 (0.5%) children were studied (52% with acute lymphoid leukemia and 24% with neuroblastoma). Twenty children (80%) presented arthritis and/or arthralgia at onset of the disease. All patients presented systemic symptoms, such as fever (22 cases - 88%). The initial blood cell count was abnormal in 16 patients (64%), showing anemia and thrombocytopenia (12 and 5 cases, respectively). Blast cells were present in only two patients and eleven patients developed blood cell count abnormalities during follow-up. X-ray studies showed abnormalities in 11/14 patients, ultrasound in 12/18, scintigraphy in 5/5, CT in 7/9 and MRI in 3/3. Bone marrow smear was abnormal in 18/22 patients, but in three of them the abnormalities were not detected by the first test. CONCLUSION: Musculoskeletal symptoms are common at the onset of neoplasia, especially for acute lymphoid leukemia, and this possibility should be considered in the differential diagnosis of rheumatic diseases. Laboratory tests may be normal at the onset of the disease, therefore serial exams should be performed. For a correct diagnosis. radiological studies and bone marrow aspiration have proven to be essential.","['Campos, Lucia Maria de Arruda', 'Goldstein, Silvia', 'Santiago, Rosabraulia Acioly', 'Jesus, Adriana Almeida de', 'Cristofani, Lilian Maria', 'Odone Filho, Vicente', 'Silva, Clovis Artur Almeida']","['Campos LM', 'Goldstein S', 'Santiago RA', 'Jesus AA', 'Cristofani LM', 'Odone Filho V', 'Silva CA']","['Unidades de Reumatologia e Oncologia Pediatricas, Instituto da Crianca, Hospital das Clinicas da Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Sao Paulo (ICr-HC-FMUSP), S.

They presently do not undergo transplantation in first remission (CR1), but there is concern about late relapses. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From 1990 to 2004, 325 adult patients received transplantations in CR1 (159 patients with inv16 and 166 patients with t(8;21), including 35 and 60 patients, respectively, with additional chromosomal abnormalities). Genoidentical allografts were performed in 64 patients with inv16 and 81 patients with t(8;21), and autografts were performed in 95 patients with inv16 and 85 patients with t(8;21). RESULTS: In patients with inv16, after allogeneic and autologous transplantation, the 5-year leukemia-free survival (LFS) rates were 59% and 66% (P = .5), the relapse incidence (RI) rates were 27% and 32% (P = .45), and the transplantation-related mortality (TRM) rates were 14% and 2% (P = .003), respectively. Female patients had a lower RI and a higher LFS. Additional chromosomal abnormalities, compared with no additional abnormalities, were associated with lower RI rate (12% v 34%, respectively; P = .01) and higher 5-year LFS rate (78% v 59%, respectively; P = .04). In patients with t(8;21), after allogeneic and autologous transplantation, the 5-year LFS rates were 60% and 66% (P = .69), the RI rates were 15% and 28% (P = .03), and the TRM rates were 24% and 6% (P = .003), respectively. Younger age and a lower WBC count at diagnosis were associated with a lower TRM and a better LFS. The TRM was lower and the RI was higher in patients with autologous transplantations versus allogeneic transplantations.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the overall progress and contribution of candidate gene association studies to current understanding of the genetic susceptibility to cancer. DATA SOURCES: We systematically examined the results of meta-analyses and pooled analyses for genetic polymorphisms and cancer risk published through March 2008. STUDY SELECTION: We identified 161 meta-analyses and pooled analyses, encompassing 18 cancer sites and 99 genes. Analyses had to meet the following criteria: include at least 500 cases, have cancer risk as outcome, not be focused on HLA antigen genetic markers, and be published in English. DATA EXTRACTION: Information on cancer site, gene name, variant, point estimate and 95% confidence interval (CI), allelic frequency, number of studies and cases, tests of study heterogeneity, and publication bias were extracted by 1 investigator and reviewed by other investigators. RESULTS: These 161 analyses evaluated 344 gene-variant cancer associations and included on average 7.3 studies and 3551 cases (range, 508-19 729 cases) per investigated association. The summary odds ratio (OR) for 98 (28%) statistically significant associations (P value <.05) were further evaluated by estimating the false-positive report probability (FPRP) at a given prior probability and statistical power. At a prior probability level of 0.001 and statistical power to detect an OR of 1.5, 13 gene-variant cancer associations remained noteworthy (FPRP <0.2). Assuming a very low prior probability of 0.000001, similar to a probability assumed for a randomly selected single-nucleotide polymorphism in a genome-wide association study, and statistical power to detect an OR of 1.5, 4 associations were considered noteworthy as denoted by an FPRP value <0.2: GSTM1 null and bladder cancer (OR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.3-1.6; P = 1.9 x 10(-14)), NAT2 slow acetylator and bladder cancer (OR, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.26-1.68; P = 2.5 x 10(-7)), MTHFR C677T and gastric cancer (OR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.31-1.77; P = 4.9 x 10(-8)), and GSTM1 null and acute leukemia (OR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.14-1.25; P = 8.6 x 10(-15)). When the OR used to determine statistical power was lowered to 1.2, 2 of the 4 noteworthy associations remained so: GSTM1 null with bladder cancer and acute leukemia. CONCLUSION: In this review of candidate gene association studies, nearly one-third of gene-variant cancer associations were statistically significant, with variants in genes encoding for metabolizing enzymes among the most consistent and highly significant associations.","['Dong, Linda M', 'Potter, John D', 'White, Emily', 'Ulrich, Cornelia M', 'Cardon, Lon R', 'Peters, Ulrike']","['Dong LM', 'Potter JD', 'White E', 'Ulrich CM', 'Cardon LR', 'Peters U']","['Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington 98109, USA.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",United States,JAMA,JAMA,7501160,,IM,"['*Genes, Neoplasm', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Meta-Analysis as Topic', 'Neoplasms/*genetics', '*Polymorphism, Genetic']",2008/05/29 09:00,2008/06/05 09:00,['2008/05/29 09:00'],"['2008/05/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/05 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/29 09:00 [entrez]']","['299/20/2423 [pii]', '10.1001/jama.299.20.2423 [doi]']",ppublish,JAMA. 2008 May 28;299(20):2423-36. doi: 10.1001/jama.299.20.2423.,20,128,,"['R25 CA94880/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R25 CA094880/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA059045/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA118421/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R25 CA094880-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC2772197,['NIHMS146387'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we show that retroviral transduction of TLS-ERG confers a growth advantage to L-G myeloid progenitor cells and blocks terminal differentiation. We found that the level of cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1) protein was significantly decreased in controls but unchanged in TLS-ERG-expressing cells after granulocyte colony-stimulating factor treatment or interleukin-3 withdrawal. Injection of TLS-ERG-expressing L-G cells induced rapid development of a leukemia-like disease in syngeneic mice. Through site-directed mutagenesis, we showed that transformation and deregulation of Cdk1 by TLS-ERG require an intact ets DNA-binding domain within the fusion protein. Interestingly, treatment of TLS-ERG-expressing L-G cells with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (Decitabine) or trichostatin A resulted in down-regulation of Cdk1 and induction of terminal differentiation. To investigate whether Cdk1 deregulation is indeed responsible for transformation by TLS-ERG, we constructed lentiviral vectors for delivery of Cdk1 mutants and small interfering RNA (siRNA). Both dominant-negative inhibition and siRNA knockdown of Cdk1 were able to restore the ability of TLS-ERG-expressing L-G cells to undergo terminal differentiation. In addition, siRNA knockdown of Cdk1 in YNH-1 cells derived from a t(16;21) acute myelogenous leukemia patient also resulted in terminal differentiation. As restoration of terminal myeloid differentiation to TLS-ERG cells is dependent on cell cycle arrest, our findings suggest an important role for Cdk1 in cellular transformation and may be useful in the search for new treatments of TLS-ERG-associated myeloid leukemia.","['Pan, Jing', 'Zou, Junhui', 'Wu, Daniel Y', 'Roberson, Rachael S', 'Hennings, Leah J', 'Ma, Xiaoyun', 'Yared, Marwan', 'Blackburn, Michael L', 'Chansky, Howard A', 'Yang, Liu']","['Pan J', 'Zou J', 'Wu DY', 'Roberson RS', 'Hennings LJ', 'Ma X', 'Yared M', 'Blackburn ML', 'Chansky HA', 'Yang L']","['Departments of Orthopedics and Medicine/Hematology, University of Washington, 1660 South Columbian Way, GMR 151, Seattle, WA 98108. lyang@u.washington.edu.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Mol Cancer Res,Molecular cancer research : MCR,101150042,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (ERG protein, mouse)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Protein Synthesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Protein c-ets-1)', '0 (RNA-Binding Protein FUS)', '0 (TLS-ERG fusion protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Transcriptional Regulator ERG)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '3X2S926L3Z (trichostatin A)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDC2 Protein Kinase)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Azacitidine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'CDC2 Protein Kinase/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Decitabine', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/metabolism', 'Hydroxamic Acids/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-3/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Myeloid Progenitor Cells/*cytology/metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*metabolism', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Protein Synthesis Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Protein c-ets-1/*metabolism', 'RNA-Binding Protein FUS/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors', 'Transcriptional Regulator ERG']",2008/05/29 09:00,2008/09/09 09:00,['2008/05/29 09:00'],"['2008/05/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/09 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/29 09:00 [entrez]']","['6/5/862 [pii]', '10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-07-2070 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Res. 2008 May;6(5):862-72. doi: 10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-07-2070.,5,,,['R01 CA090941/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Coadministration of vorinostat dramatically increased MK-0457 lethality in K562 and LAMA84 cells. Notably, the MK-0457/vorinostat regimen was highly active against primary CD34(+) chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) cells and Ba/F3 cells bearing various Bcr/Abl mutations (ie, T315I, E255K, and M351T), as well as IM-resistant K562 cells exhibiting Bcr/Abl-independent, Lyn-dependent resistance. These events were associated with inactivation and down-regulation of wild-type (wt) and mutated Bcr/Abl (particularly T315I). Moreover, treatment with MK-0457 resulted in accumulation of cells with 4N or more DNA content, whereas coadministration of vorinostat markedly enhanced aurora kinase inhibition by MK-0457, and preferentially killed polyploid cells. Furthermore, vorinostat also interacted with a selective inhibitor of aurora kinase A and B to potentiate apoptosis without modifying Bcr/Abl activity. Finally, vorinostat markedly induced Bim expression, while blockade of Bim induction by siRNA dramatically diminished the capacity of this agent to potentiate MK-0457 lethality. Together, these findings indicate that vorinostat strikingly increases MK-0457 activity against IM-sensitive and -resistant CML cells through inactivation of Bcr/Abl and aurora kinases, as well as by induction of Bim.","['Dai, Yun', 'Chen, Shuang', 'Venditti, Charis A', 'Pei, Xin-Yan', 'Nguyen, Tri K', 'Dent, Paul', 'Grant, Steven']","['Dai Y', 'Chen S', 'Venditti CA', 'Pei XY', 'Nguyen TK', 'Dent P', 'Grant S']","['Department of Medicine, Virginia Commonwealth University/Massey Cancer Center, Richmond, VA 23298, USA.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BCL2L11 protein, human)', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '58IFB293JI (Vorinostat)', '639089-54-6 (VX680)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (AURKA protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Aurora Kinase A)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Aurora Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Aurora Kinase A', 'Aurora Kinases', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Synergism', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/*pharmacology', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Membrane Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines', 'Vorinostat']",2008/05/29 09:00,2008/09/06 09:00,['2008/05/29 09:00'],"['2008/05/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/06 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/29 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)60425-6 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2007-10-116376 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2008 Aug 1;112(3):793-804. doi: 10.1182/blood-2007-10-116376.

In the present study, we investigated the mechanisms underlying the anticancer activity of CTX III in human leukaemia (HL-60 cells). Cardiotoxin III activated the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) pathway of apoptosis in HL-60 cells, as indicated by increased levels of calcium and glucose-related protein 78 (Grp78), and triggered the subsequent activation of micro-calpain and caspase 12. In addition, CTX III initiated the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway in HL-60 cells, as evidenced by an increased Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, the release of cytochrome c and activation of caspase 9. In the presence of 50 micromol/L Z-ATAD-FMK (a caspase 12 inhibitor) and 100 micromol/L Z-LEHD-FMK (a caspase 9 inhibitor), the CTX III-mediated activation of caspase 9 and caspase 3 was significantly reduced. There was no significant effect of the caspase 12 inhibitor Z-ATAD-FMK on mitochondrial cytochrome c release. Cardiotoxin III-mediated activation of caspase 12 was not abrogated in the presence of the caspase 9 inhibitor Z-LEHD-FMK, indicating that caspase 12 activation was not downstream of caspase 9. These results indicate that CTX III induces cell apoptosis via both ER stress and a mitochondrial death pathway.","['Chien, Ching-Ming', 'Yang, Sheng-Huei', 'Chang, Long-Sen', 'Lin, Shinne-Ren']","['Chien CM', 'Yang SH', 'Chang LS', 'Lin SR']","['Faculty of Medicinal and Applied Chemistry, Kaohsiung Medical University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Australia,Clin Exp Pharmacol Physiol,Clinical and experimental pharmacology & physiology,0425076,"['0 (Cobra Cardiotoxin Proteins)', '0 (Endoplasmic Reticulum Chaperone BiP)', '0 (HSPA5 protein, human)', '0 (Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Molecular Chaperones)', '0 (cardiotoxin III, Naja naja atra)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP12 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Calpain)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 12)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (mu-calpain)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects/physiology', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Calpain/metabolism', 'Caspase 12/metabolism', 'Cobra Cardiotoxin Proteins/*pharmacology', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum/drug effects/*physiology', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum Chaperone BiP', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Heat-Shock Proteins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/*physiology', 'Molecular Chaperones/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/*physiology', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",2008/05/29 09:00,2009/01/17 09:00,['2008/05/29 09:00'],"['2008/05/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/29 09:00 [entrez]']","['CEP4968 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1440-1681.2008.04968.x [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Exp Pharmacol Physiol. 2008 Sep;35(9):1059-64. doi: 10.1111/j.1440-1681.2008.04968.x.

Evaluation included volumetry, calculation of mean diffusivity (MD) and fractional anisotropy (FA), and comparison of results to an age-matched control group. RESULTS: DTI showed significantly reduced FA values in the temporal lobes (difference of 0.069 units, P < 0.001), hippocampi (difference of 0.033 units, P < 0.001), and thalami (difference of 0.046 units, P = 0.001), which were accompanied by significant white matter volume loss (difference of 92 cm(3), P < 0.001). Significant elevations of MD were limited to the temporal white matter (difference of 42 x 10(-6) mm(2)/s, P = 0.005). Global and frontal white matter MD correlated negatively to increasing age of the survivors (P < 0.01).

Consequently the natural isoforms are limited, constant and characterized. Purification included selective precipitations and chromatographical steps. Characterization of structure and allergenic activity assessment of milk allergens were carried out using physicochemical and immunochemical methods. Taken together data demonstrated the absence of impurities and of contamination by other milk allergens in each preparation. NMR and circular dichroism analyses confirmed the native conformation and proper folding of ALA and BLG and the expected absence of folding of bovine and caprine casein. Enzyme immuno assays confirmed the native conformation of BLG and the purity and immunoreactivity of all the proteins.

In APL, PML-NDs are disrupted, thus implicating these structures in the pathogenesis of this leukaemia. Unexpectedly, recent studies indicate that PML and the PML-ND play a tumour suppressive role in several different types of human neoplasms in addition to APL.

These fusion oncoproteins constitutively repress RARalpha target genes, in large part through aberrant recruitment of multiprotein co-repressor complexes. PML and PML-RARalpha have previously been shown to associate with the retinoblastoma (Rb) tumour suppressor protein in its hypophosphorylated state. Here, we demonstrate that PLZF also interacts with Rb in vitro and in vivo. The interaction between PLZF and Rb is mediated through the Rb pocket and the region of PLZF that lies between its transcriptional repression (poxvirus and zinc-finger, POZ) and DNA-binding (zinc-finger) domains. In addition, Rb can simultaneously interact with PLZF and the E2F1 S phase-inducing transcription factor, suggesting that these proteins can exist in the same multiprotein complex. In contrast to the interaction of Rb with PML or E2F1, the PLZF-Rb interaction is not dependent on hypophosphorylation of Rb. These data are supported by chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis, which indicates that PLZF associates with the promoter region of CDC6, a known E2F/Rb target gene. Co-expression of PLZF and Rb results in enhancement of transcriptional repression of PLZF and E2F/Rb target genes, indicating functional co-operation between the two proteins. Both PLZF and Rb have been shown to function in stem cells and taken together these data suggest that interactions between PLZF and Rb could be important in stem cell biology.","['Petrie, K', 'Guidez, F', 'Zhu, J', 'Howell, L', 'Owen, G', 'Chew, Y P', 'Parks, S', 'Waxman, S', 'Licht, J', 'Mittnacht, S', 'Zelent, A']","['Petrie K', 'Guidez F', 'Zhu J', 'Howell L', 'Owen G', 'Chew YP', 'Parks S', 'Waxman S', 'Licht J', 'Mittnacht S', 'Zelent A']","['Section of Haemato-Oncology, Institute of Cancer Research, Sutton, UK.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)', '147855-37-6 (ZBTB16 protein, human)']",IM,"['Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'Humans', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein', 'Protein Binding', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic']",2008/05/28 09:00,2008/10/01 09:00,['2008/05/28 09:00'],"['2008/05/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/01 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['onc2008159 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2008.159 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2008 Sep 4;27(39):5260-6. doi: 10.1038/onc.2008.159.

We determined the occurrence of the E17K variant in a panel of 764 tumour samples. These included breast, lung, ovarian, colorectal and pancreatic carcinomas as well as melanomas and glioblastomas. Despite the fact that these tumours are known to bear alterations in genes involved in the PI3K signalling pathway, AKT1(E17K) was detected only in breast (16/273), colorectal (1/88) and lung (1/155) cancers.

Our results, showing that AKT1 mutations seem to occur in a tissue-specific fashion have basic and clinical implications.

The trans-activator protein Tax of HTLV-I can promote cell-cycle progression in resting T cells along with induction of cyclin D2 and cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk6) gene expression. Here, we found that Tax cannot induce cell-cycle progression in resting fibroblasts and analysed the molecular basis of the cell-type specificity. Tax activated cyclin D2 and cdk6 promoters in T cells, but not in fibroblasts, depending on its ability to activate the transcription factor nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB. Expression of cyclin D2 and CDK6 activated the transcription factor E2F, which is essential for cell-cycle progression, in both T cells and fibroblasts. Short-hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated inhibition of cyclin D2 and CDK6 induction suppressed Tax-induced activation of E2F in T cells. Finally, shRNA-mediated downregulation of NF-kappaB p65 or p100 expression reduced Tax-induced activation of cyclin D2 and/or cdk6 promoters and cell-cycle progression in T cells. These results indicate that Tax-induced cell-cycle progression in T cells is mediated, at least in part, through cell-type-specific activation of the cyclin D2 and cdk6 genes through NF-kappaB and may be important for the cell-type-specific oncogenesis.","['Iwanaga, R', 'Ozono, E', 'Fujisawa, J', 'Ikeda, M A', 'Okamura, N', 'Huang, Y', 'Ohtani, K']","['Iwanaga R', 'Ozono E', 'Fujisawa J', 'Ikeda MA', 'Okamura N', 'Huang Y', 'Ohtani K']","['Laboratory of Microbiology and Immunology, Graduate School of Health Sciences, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, Japan.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Cyclin D2)', '0 (E2F Transcription Factors)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (tax protein, Human T-lymphotrophic virus 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 6)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Cell Cycle', 'Cell Line', 'Cyclin D2/*genetics', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 6/*genetics', 'E2F Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Products, tax/*physiology', 'Humans', 'NF-kappa B/*physiology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Rats']",2008/05/28 09:00,2010/07/10 06:00,['2008/05/28 09:00'],"['2008/05/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/10 06:00 [medline]', '2008/05/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['onc2008174 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2008.174 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2008 Sep 18;27(42):5635-42. doi: 10.1038/onc.2008.174.

EoL-1 cells have an FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion gene that causes transformation of eosinophilic precursor cells into leukemia cells. The HDAC inhibitors apicidin and n-butyrate suppress the proliferation of EoL-1 cells and induce differentiation into eosinophils by a decrease in the protein level of FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha without affecting the mRNA level for FIP1L1-PDGFRA. In this study, we analyzed the mechanism by which the protein level of FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha is decreased by apicidin and n-butyrate. METHODS: EoL-1 cells were incubated in the presence of the HDAC inhibitors apicidin, trichostatin A or n-butyrate. The protein levels of FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha and phosphorylated eIF-2alpha were determined by Western blotting. Actinomycin D and cycloheximide were used to block RNA synthesis and protein synthesis, respectively, in the chasing experiment of the amount of FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha protein. RESULTS: When apicidin- and n-butyrate-treated EoL-1 cells were incubated in the presence of actinomycin D, the decrease in the protein level of FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha was significantly enhanced when compared with controls. In contrast, the protein levels were not changed by cycloheximide among these groups. Apicidin and n-butyrate induced the continuous phosphorylation of eIF-2alpha for up to 8 days. CONCLUSIONS: The decrease in the level of FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha protein by continuous inhibition of HDAC may be due to the decrease in the translation rate of FIP1L1-PDGFRA.","['Ishihara, Kenji', 'Kaneko, Motoko', 'Kitamura, Hajime', 'Takahashi, Aki', 'Hong, Jang Ja', 'Seyama, Toshio', 'Iida, Koji', 'Wada, Hiroshi', 'Hirasawa, Noriyasu', 'Ohuchi, Kazuo']","['Ishihara K', 'Kaneko M', 'Kitamura H', 'Takahashi A', 'Hong JJ', 'Seyama T', 'Iida K', 'Wada H', 'Hirasawa N', 'Ohuchi K']","['Laboratory of Pathophysiological Biochemistry, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan. ishihara@wadalab.mech.tohoku.ac.jp']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Int Arch Allergy Immunol,International archives of allergy and immunology,9211652,"['0 (Butyrates)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-2)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Peptides, Cyclic)', '0 (apicidin)', '0 (mRNA Cleavage and Polyadenylation Factors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor alpha)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)']",IM,"['Acetylation/drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Butyrates/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Eosinophils/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-2/analysis/drug effects/*metabolism', '*Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Histone Deacetylases/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hypereosinophilic Syndrome/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*analysis/drug effects/metabolism', 'Peptides, Cyclic/*pharmacology', 'Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor alpha/*analysis/drug effects/metabolism', 'mRNA Cleavage and Polyadenylation Factors/*analysis/drug effects/metabolism']",2008/06/25 09:00,2008/08/08 09:00,['2008/06/25 09:00'],"['2008/06/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/08 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['000126053 [pii]', '10.1159/000126053 [doi]']",ppublish,Int Arch Allergy Immunol. 2008;146 Suppl 1:7-10. doi: 10.1159/000126053.

METHODS: Nested reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed on 40 bone marrow samples from 23 patients to amplify the ABL kinase domain, followed by direct sequencing and sequence homologous analysis. RESULTS: In the 23 patients analyzed, the ABL domain point mutations was detected in 7 patients who presented with 5 types of nucleotide changes, namely T315I(n=3), Y253H, E255K, F317L and G321W. The incidence of mutations in chronic phase (CP), accelerated phase (AP) and blast phase (BP) was 25.00%, 40.00% and 30.00%, respectively. For 6 of the 7 patients with mutations who were resistant to imatinib before sequencing, the daily drug dose had been increased to 600-800 mg daily for poor response to 400 mg/day imatinib. During the follow-up for 3-6 months, only the patient with F317L achieved major cytogenetic response (MCR), and the patient with Y253H and 1 of the 3 with T315I progressed to BP. The newly diagnosed patient with G321W IN cp achieved a complete hematologic remission and had a significant decrease of the proportion of BCR-ABL-positive cells.

The type of mutations is associated with the level of resistance to imatinib, and detection of ABL kinase point mutations by direct sequencing may help estimate the prognosis and plan for therapeutic strategy adjustment.","['Ouyang, Zhao', 'DU, Qing-feng', 'Liu, Xiao-li', 'Zhang, Song', 'Zhu, Hong-qian', 'Gong, Jun-mei', 'Song, Lan-lin', 'Ouyang, Ling-yun', 'Liu, Zhi']","['Ouyang Z', 'DU QF', 'Liu XL', 'Zhang S', 'Zhu HQ', 'Gong JM', 'Song LL', 'Ouyang LY', 'Liu Z']","['Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510515, China. ouyangzhao82@yahoo.com.cn']",,['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Nan Fang Yi Ke Da Xue Xue Bao,Nan fang yi ke da xue xue bao = Journal of Southern Medical University,101266132,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (ARG tyrosine kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Base Sequence', 'Benzamides', 'Drug Resistance/genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', '*Point Mutation', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*genetics', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use']",2008/05/28 09:00,2009/04/14 09:00,['2008/05/28 09:00'],"['2008/05/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/14 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/28 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Nan Fang Yi Ke Da Xue Xue Bao. 2008 May;28(5):704-6.,5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The cellular and cytokine mechanisms driving GVHD are now well defined and have led to several prophylactic approaches. Selective allodepletion techniques promise to prevent GVHD without causing immune deficiency provoked by global T-cell depletion. Targeted dosing of other (non-T-cells) cells in the graft - such as CD34+ progenitors, regulatory T cells, natural killer cells and mesenchymal stromal cells - can also lead to transplants designed to retain immune capability without causing GVHD. Immunosuppressive drugs such as methotrexate, cyclosporine and anti-lymphocyte antibodies are the mainstay in the prevention of GVHD and can be used in conjunction with engineered grafts to eliminate GVHD. In future it is anticipated that further refinements in targeting the elimination or suppression of the GVHD reacting T cells should be selective enough to preserve the important graft-versus-leukemia effect which contributes to the cure of malignant diseases by allogeneic stem-cell transplantation.","['Barrett, A John', 'Le Blanc, Katarina']","['Barrett AJ', 'Le Blanc K']","['Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,Best Pract Res Clin Haematol,Best practice & research.

Karyotype of the unstimulated peripheral blood at diagnosis was 46,XX,i(7)(q10),der(17)t(1;17)(q21;p11.1),-18,+mar[15].

Both the i(7q) and der(17) were present in two clones, which differed from each other in having two distinct derivative chromosomes 10. In one clone, the additional material on the short arm of chromosome 10 appears to have originated from either chromosome 1p or chromosome 22q, whereas for the second clone the donor of the additional material is most likely chromosome 8q.

ERAF, EDRF) transcript levels are reduced in the blood of mice incubating transmissible spongiform encephalopathy. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were used to measure AHSP transcript and protein levels in normal blood donors, patients with CJD, and patients with other neuronal and hematologic diseases. Temporal AHSP expression was measured in sheep incubating bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). RESULTS: Quantitation of AHSP in peripheral blood from normal blood donors revealed that protein levels, but not transcript levels, are influenced by sex with higher levels found in males, suggesting posttranslational regulation involving the product of an X-linked gene. When AHSP mRNA and protein levels were quantitated in peripheral blood from patients with variant and sporadic CJD, no consistent differences from normal were found. Serial quantitation of AHSP in individual BSE-infected sheep did not reveal any disease-related changes. CONCLUSION: We conclude that quantitation of AHSP is not likely to be useful for detection of preclinical prion disease in man.","['Appleford, Nigel E J', 'Wilson, Kim', 'Houston, Fiona', 'Bruce, Lesley J', 'Morrison, Alex', 'Bishop, Matthew', 'Chalmers, Kevin', 'Miele, Gino', 'Massey, Edwin', 'Prowse, Chris', 'Manson, Jean', 'Will, Robert G', 'Clinton, Michael', 'MacGregor, Ian', 'Anstee, David J']","['Appleford NE', 'Wilson K', 'Houston F', 'Bruce LJ', 'Morrison A', 'Bishop M', 'Chalmers K', 'Miele G', 'Massey E', 'Prowse C', 'Manson J', 'Will RG', 'Clinton M', 'MacGregor I', 'Anstee DJ']","['Bristol Institute for Transfusion Sciences, National Blood Service, Bristol, UK.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Transfusion,Transfusion,0417360,"['0 (AHSP protein, human)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Blood Proteins)', '0 (Molecular Chaperones)', '0 (Prions)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Anemia, Iron-Deficiency/blood/diagnosis', 'Animals', 'Biomarkers/*blood', '*Blood Donors', 'Blood Proteins/genetics', 'Cattle', 'Creutzfeldt-Jakob Syndrome/*blood/*diagnosis', 'Encephalopathy, Bovine Spongiform/blood/diagnosis', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'Hemochromatosis/blood/diagnosis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/blood/diagnosis', 'Male', 'Mass Screening/*methods', 'Molecular Chaperones/*blood/genetics', 'Neural Tube Defects/blood/diagnosis', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Porphyrias/blood/diagnosis', 'Prions/blood/genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/blood', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sheep']",2008/05/28 09:00,2008/10/01 09:00,['2008/05/28 09:00'],"['2008/05/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/01 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['TRF01759 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1537-2995.2008.01759.x [doi]']",ppublish,Transfusion. 2008 Aug;48(8):1616-26. doi: 10.1111/j.1537-2995.2008.01759.x.

Erythroid recovery, disappearance of recipient type and appearance of donor-type isohaemaglutinins was compared in 84 patients undergoing RIC and 50 patients with standard-conditioning (SCo) HCT. All patients received alemtuzumab as part of their conditioning. The incidence of immune-mediated anaemia and red cell transfusion usage were also compared. Immune factors affecting post-transplant erythroid kinetics showed little variance between different conditioning regimens. Disappearance of recipient isohaemaglutinins and emergence of donor red cells proceeded at similar rates in RIC and SCo transplants; the effects of ABO mismatch were marginal. Pure red cell aplasia, alloimmune haemolysis and autoimmune haemolytic anaemia were not more common in RIC transplants. We believe that alemtuzumab played a critical role in dampening immune reactions of both the host and the donor. Patients in both conditioning groups had similar post-transplant erythroid burst-forming unit (BFU-E) counts; BFU-E chimaerism analysis showed that 90-100% progenitors were of donor origin. However, transfusion requirements were significantly higher in the SCo group, due at least partly to earlier onset of bone marrow hypoplasia.","['Mijovic, Aleksandar', 'Abdallah, Atiyeh', 'Pearce, Laurence', 'Tobal, Khalid', 'Mufti, Ghulam J']","['Mijovic A', 'Abdallah A', 'Pearce L', 'Tobal K', 'Mufti GJ']","[""Department of Haematological Medicine, King's College Hospital, London, UK. aleksandar.mijovic@kch.nhs.uk""]",,['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (ABO Blood-Group System)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Hemagglutinins)', '3A189DH42V (Alemtuzumab)']",IM,"['ABO Blood-Group System', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Alemtuzumab', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Chimera', 'Erythrocyte Transfusion', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells', 'Erythropoiesis/*drug effects', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hemagglutinins/analysis', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/blood/*therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Prospective Studies', 'Reticulocyte Count', 'Time Factors', 'Tissue Donors', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods', 'Young Adult']",2008/05/28 09:00,2009/05/20 09:00,['2008/05/28 09:00'],"['2008/05/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/20 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['BJH7211 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2008.07211.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2008 Jul;142(3):444-52. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2008.07211.x.

There were no significant differences in the growth curves or colony formation between the JurkatB cells and parental Jurkat cells. The effects of bortezomib on cytotoxicity, cell cycle arrest, and induction of apoptosis were decreased in JurkatB cells compared with parental Jurkat cells. A mutation in the proteasome beta5 subunit (PSMB5) gene (G322A), which encodes an amino acid change from Ala to Thr at polypeptide position 108, was detected by sequencing full-length cDNA clones and direct polymerase chain reaction products of the PSMB5 gene. Bortezomib caused less inhibition of chymotrypsin-like activity in resistant cells. When the G322A mutant PSMB5 was retrovirally introduced into parental Jurkat cells, it conferred bortezomib resistance to these cells, resulting in decreased cytotoxicity, apoptosis, and inhibition of chymotrypsin-like activity. The predicted structure of A108T-mutated PSMB5 shows a conformational change that suggests decreased affinity to bortezomib. In short, the G322A mutation of the PSMB5 gene is a novel mechanism for bortezomib resistance.","['Lu, Shuqing', 'Yang, Jianmin', 'Song, Xianmin', 'Gong, Shenglan', 'Zhou, Hong', 'Guo, Lieping', 'Song, Ningxia', 'Bao, Xiaochen', 'Chen, Pingping', 'Wang, Jianmin']","['Lu S', 'Yang J', 'Song X', 'Gong S', 'Zhou H', 'Guo L', 'Song N', 'Bao X', 'Chen P', 'Wang J']","['Department of Hematology, Changhai Hospital, Second Military Medical University, 174 Changhai Road, Shanghai 200433, China.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Pharmacol Exp Ther,The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics,0376362,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Boronic Acids)', '0 (Protease Inhibitors)', '0 (Proteasome Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (PSMB5 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/genetics', 'Boronic Acids/*pharmacology', 'Bortezomib', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', '*Point Mutation', 'Protease Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/*genetics', 'Proteasome Inhibitors', 'Pyrazines/*pharmacology', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",2008/05/27 09:00,2008/08/13 09:00,['2008/05/27 09:00'],"['2008/05/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/13 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['jpet.108.138131 [pii]', '10.1124/jpet.108.138131 [doi]']",ppublish,J Pharmacol Exp Ther. 2008 Aug;326(2):423-31. doi: 10.1124/jpet.108.138131.

In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that gingival fibroblasts may exert local osteotropic effects through production of IL-6 and related cytokines. IL-6-type cytokine expression and regulation by IL-1beta and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) were studied in fibroblasts from the non-inflamed gingiva of healthy individuals. Constitutive mRNA expression of IL-6, IL-11, and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), but not of oncostatin M (OSM), was demonstrated, as was concentration-dependent stimulation of IL-6 and LIF mRNA and of protein by IL-1beta and TNF-alpha. IL-11 mRNA and protein were concentration-dependently stimulated by IL-1beta. The signaling pathway involved in IL-6 and LIF mRNA stimulation involved MAP kinases, but not NF-kappaB. The findings support the view that resident cells may influence the pathogenesis of periodontal disease through osteotropic IL-6-type cytokine production mediated by activation of MAP kinases.

In this study, we have characterized Leydig cell re-generation and expression of selected cell-signaling molecules in a germ cell-free model of EDS action. This model offers the advantage that re-generation occurs on a stable background without confounding changes from the regressing and repopulating germ cell population. Adult rats were treated with busulfan to remove the germ cell population and Leydig cells were then ablated with EDS. Testicular testosterone levels declined markedly within 24 h of EDS treatment and started to recover after 8 days. After EDS treatment there were marked declines in levels of Leydig cell-specific mRNA transcripts coding for steroidogenic enzymes cytochrome P450 11a1 (Cyp11a1), cytochrome P450 17a1 (Cyp17a1), 3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (Hsd3b1), 17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 3 (Hsd17b3) and the LH receptor. Levels of all transcripts recovered within 20 days of EDS treatment apart from Hsd17b3, which remained undetectable up to 20 days. Immunohistochemical localization of CYP11A1 during the phase of early Leydig cell re-generation showed that the Leydig cell precursors are spindle-shaped peritubular cells. Studies on factors which may be involved in Leydig cell re-generation showed there were significant but transient increases in platelet-derived growth factor A (Pdgfa), leukemia inhibitory factor (Lif), and neurofilament heavy polypeptide (Nefh) after EDS, while desert hedgehog (Dhh) levels declined sharply but recovered by 3 days. This study shows that the Leydig cell precursors are peritubular cells and that expression of Pdgfa and Lif is increased at the start of the re-generation process when precursor proliferation is likely to be taking place.","[""O'Shaughnessy, P J"", 'Morris, I D', 'Baker, P J']","[""O'Shaughnessy PJ"", 'Morris ID', 'Baker PJ']","['Division of Cell Sciences, Institute of Comparative Medicine, University of Glasgow Veterinary School, Bearsden Road, Glasgow G61 1QH, UK. p.j.oshaughnessy@vet.gla.ac.uk']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Reproduction,"Reproduction (Cambridge, England)",100966036,"['0 (Antispermatogenic Agents)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Hedgehog Proteins)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Mesylates)', '0 (Neurofilament Proteins)', '0 (Platelet-Derived Growth Factor)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, LH)', '0 (platelet-derived growth factor A)', '108688-71-7 (neurofilament protein H)', '3XMK78S47O (Testosterone)', 'EC 1.1.- (17-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenases)', 'EC 1.1.- (17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 3)', 'EC 1.1.- (3-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenases)', 'EC 1.14.14.19 (Steroid 17-alpha-Hydroxylase)', 'EC 1.14.15.6 (Cholesterol Side-Chain Cleavage Enzyme)', 'EW8V7BJ66Q (ethylene dimethanesulfonate)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)']",IM,"['17-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenases/genetics', '3-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenases/genetics', 'Animals', 'Antispermatogenic Agents', 'Base Sequence', 'Busulfan', 'Cholesterol Side-Chain Cleavage Enzyme/genetics', 'DNA Primers', 'Gene Expression', 'Hedgehog Proteins/genetics', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/genetics', 'Leydig Cells/*physiology', 'Male', 'Mesylates', 'Models, Animal', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neurofilament Proteins/genetics', 'Platelet-Derived Growth Factor/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Receptors, LH/genetics', 'Regeneration/*genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Signal Transduction/*genetics', 'Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Steroid 17-alpha-Hydroxylase/genetics', 'Testis/cytology/metabolism', 'Testosterone/analysis']",2008/05/27 09:00,2008/12/23 09:00,['2008/05/27 09:00'],"['2008/05/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/23 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['135/6/851 [pii]', '10.1530/REP-07-0529 [doi]']",ppublish,Reproduction. 2008 Jun;135(6):851-8. doi: 10.1530/REP-07-0529.,6,,,['Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We evaluated WT1 as an immunotherapeutic target using our proven DNA fusion vaccine design, p.DOM-peptide, encoding a minimal tumor-derived major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I-binding epitope downstream of a foreign sequence of tetanus toxin. Three p.DOM-peptide vaccines, each encoding a different WT1-derived, HLA-A2-restricted epitope, induced cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) in humanized transgenic mice expressing chimeric HLA-A2, without affecting hematopoietic stem cells. Mouse CTLs killed human leukemia cells in vitro, indicating peptide processing/presentation. Low numbers of T cells specific for these epitopes have been described in cancer patients. Expanded human T cells specific for each epitope were lytic in vitro. Focusing on human WT1(37-45)-specific cells, the most avid of the murine responses, we demonstrated lysis of primary leukemias, underscoring their clinical relevance. Finally, we showed that these human CTL kill target cells transfected with the relevant p.DOM-peptide DNA vaccine, confirming that WT1-derived epitopes are presented to T cells similarly by tumors and following DNA vaccination. Together, these data link mouse and human studies to suggest that rationally designed DNA vaccines encoding WT1-derived epitopes, particularly WT1(37-45), have the potential to induce/expand functional tumor-specific cytotoxic responses in cancer patients.","['Chaise, Coralie', 'Buchan, Sarah L', 'Rice, Jason', 'Marquet, Jeanine', 'Rouard, Helene', 'Kuentz, Mathieu', 'Vittes, Gisella E', 'Molinier-Frenkel, Valerie', 'Farcet, Jean-Pierre', 'Stauss, Hans J', 'Delfau-Larue, Marie-Helene', 'Stevenson, Freda K']","['Chaise C', 'Buchan SL', 'Rice J', 'Marquet J', 'Rouard H', 'Kuentz M', 'Vittes GE', 'Molinier-Frenkel V', 'Farcet JP', 'Stauss HJ', 'Delfau-Larue MH', 'Stevenson FK']","[""Inserm U-841, Institut Mondor de Recherche Biomedicale (IMRB), Departement d'Immunologie, Dermatologie et Oncologie, Creteil, France.""]",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (HLA-A Antigens)', '0 (HLA-A*02:01 antigen)', '0 (HLA-A2 Antigen)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Vaccines, DNA)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigen Presentation/immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'HLA-A Antigens/immunology', 'HLA-A2 Antigen', 'Health', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Peptides/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/cytology/immunology', 'Tissue Donors', '*Vaccination', 'Vaccines, DNA/*immunology', 'WT1 Proteins/*immunology']",2008/05/27 09:00,2008/10/10 09:00,['2008/05/27 09:00'],"['2008/05/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/10 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)59822-4 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2008-02-137695 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2008 Oct 1;112(7):2956-64. doi: 10.1182/blood-2008-02-137695.

CCG AYAs had a 63% event-free survival (EFS) and 67% overall survival (OS) at 7 years in contrast to the CALGB AYAs, in which 7-year EFS was only 34% (P < .001; relative hazard rate [RHR] = 2.2) and OS was 46% (P < .001; RHR = 1.9). While CALGB AYAs aged 16 to 17 years achieved similar outcomes to all CCG AYAs with a 7-year EFS of 55%, the EFS for 18- to 20-year-old CALGB patients was only 29%. Comparison of the regimens showed that CCG AYAs received earlier and more intensive central nervous system prophylaxis and higher cumulative doses of nonmyelosuppressive agents. There were no differences in outcomes of those who reached maintenance therapy on time compared with those who were delayed. Based on these observations, a prospective study for AYAs with ALL using the more successful approach of the CCG has been initiated.","['Stock, Wendy', 'La, Mei', 'Sanford, Ben', 'Bloomfield, Clara D', 'Vardiman, James W', 'Gaynon, Paul', 'Larson, Richard A', 'Nachman, James']","['Stock W', 'La M', 'Sanford B', 'Bloomfield CD', 'Vardiman JW', 'Gaynon P', 'Larson RA', 'Nachman J']","['Section of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Chicago and University of Chicago Cancer Research Center, IL 60637, USA. wstock@medicine.bsd.uchicago.edu']","[""Children's Cancer Group"", 'Cancer and Leukemia Group B studies']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', '*Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols', 'Clinical Protocols', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/mortality/radiotherapy', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",2008/05/27 09:00,2008/10/01 09:00,['2008/05/27 09:00'],"['2008/05/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/01 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)49595-3 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2008-01-130237 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2008 Sep 1;112(5):1646-54. doi: 10.1182/blood-2008-01-130237.

D-cyclins are overexpressed in many tumors, including multiple myeloma and leukemia, and contribute to disease progression and chemoresistance. To better understand the role and impact of D-cyclins in hematologic malignancies, we conducted a high throughput screen for inhibitors of the cyclin D2 promoter and identified the drug cyproheptadine. In myeloma and leukemia cells, cyproheptadine decreased expression of cyclins D1, D2, and D3 and arrested these cells in the G(0)/G(1) phase. After D-cyclin suppression, cyproheptadine induced apoptosis in myeloma and leukemia cell lines and primary patient samples preferentially over normal hematopoietic cells. In mouse models of myeloma and leukemia, cyproheptadine inhibited tumor growth without significant toxicity. Cyproheptadine-induced apoptosis was preceded by activation of the mitochondrial pathway of caspase activation and was independent of the drug's known activity as an H1 histamine and serotonin receptor antagonist. Thus, cyproheptadine represents a lead for a novel therapeutic agent for the treatment of malignancy. Because the drug is well tolerated and already approved in multiple countries for clinical use as an antihistamine and appetite stimulant, it could be moved directly into clinical trials for cancer.","['Mao, Xinliang', 'Liang, Sheng-ben', 'Hurren, Rose', 'Gronda, Marcela', 'Chow, Sue', 'Xu, G Wei', 'Wang, Xiaoming', 'Beheshti Zavareh, Reza', 'Jamal, Nazir', 'Messner, Hans', 'Hedley, David W', 'Datti, Alessandro', 'Wrana, Jeff L', 'Zhu, Yuanxiao', 'Shi, Chang-xin', 'Lee, Kyle', 'Tiedemann, Rodger', 'Trudel, Suzanne', 'Stewart, A Keith', 'Schimmer, Aaron D']","['Mao X', 'Liang SB', 'Hurren R', 'Gronda M', 'Chow S', 'Xu GW', 'Wang X', 'Beheshti Zavareh R', 'Jamal N', 'Messner H', 'Hedley DW', 'Datti A', 'Wrana JL', 'Zhu Y', 'Shi CX', 'Lee K', 'Tiedemann R', 'Trudel S', 'Stewart AK', 'Schimmer AD']","['Princess Margaret Hospital, Ontario Cancer Institute, Toronto, ON, Canada.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (CCND2 protein, human)', '0 (CCND3 protein, human)', '0 (Ccnd3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Cyclin D2)', '0 (Cyclin D3)', '0 (Cyclins)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)', '2YHB6175DO (Cyproheptadine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclin D1/genetics', 'Cyclin D2', 'Cyclin D3', 'Cyclins/*genetics', 'Cyproheptadine/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Mice', 'Multiple Myeloma/*drug therapy/pathology']",2008/05/27 09:00,2008/09/06 09:00,['2008/05/27 09:00'],"['2008/05/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/06 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)60422-0 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2008-02-142687 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2008 Aug 1;112(3):760-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2008-02-142687.

The surface hybridization of the immobilized single-stranded CML DNA fragment with its complementary DNA fragment was evidenced by electrochemical methods using NAD as a novel electrochemical indicator, with a detection limit of 6.7 x 10(-9)M and a linear response range of 1.8 x 10(-8)M to 9.1 x 10(-8)M for CML DNA.

In U937 cells ectopically overexpressing AXL, addition of exogenous Gas6 induced AXL phosphorylation and activation of the Akt and ERK1/2 survival pathways. The Gas6-AXL activation pathway of drug resistance was associated with increased expression of Bcl-2 and Twist.

Th2 cell identity is maintained in memory Th2 cells. Significant advances in understanding of the molecular requirement for these processes have been made. The expression of GATA3, a master transcription factor for Th2 cell differentiation, is uniquely regulated by several distinct mechanisms.

All offspring suckled from surrogate infected or control mothers, except one group of infected pups left with their biological mothers. Thirteen of 91 infected pups developed lymphoma. Inverse-PCR, DNA cloning, and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) were used to study the virus integration sites (VIS) and alterations in gene expression. VIS were randomly distributed throughout the genome. The majority of insertion sites were found in chromosomes 10, 12 and 13. A total of 209 proviral genomic insertion sites were located with 52 intragenic and 157 intergenic sites. We have identified 29 target genes. Four genes including Tacc3, Aurka, Gfi1 and Ahi1 showed the maximum upregulation of mRNA expression. These four genes can be considered as candidate genes based on their association with cancer. Upregulation of these genes may be involved in this type of lymphoma development.

To enhance its VDR antagonistic actions, we synthesized multiple analogues of 1alpha,25-(OH)(2)D(3)-26,23-lactam. Among these analogues, (23S,25S)-N-phenetyl-1alpha,25-(OH)(2)D(3)-26,23-lactam, ((23S,25S)-DLAM-2P) had the strongest VDR binding affinity, which was 3 times higher than that of (23S,25S)-DLAM-1P.

(23S,25S)-DLAM-2P was 5-12 times more potent as a vitamin D antagonist than (23S,25S)-DLAM-1P in HL-60 cells, human and mouse bone marrow cultures.

Our previous studies indicated that decreased arsenite sensitivity correlated with reduced mitotic spindle checkpoint function and reduced expression of the checkpoint protein BUBR1. In the current study, arsenite induced securin and cyclin B stabilization, BUBR1 phosphorylation, and spindle checkpoint activation. Arsenite also increased activating cyclin dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) Thr(161) phosphorylation but decreased inhibitory Tyr15 phosphorylation. Mitotic arrest resulted in apoptosis as indicated by colocalization of mitotic phospho-Histone H3 with active caspase 3. Apoptosis was associated with BCL-2 Ser70 phosphorylation. Inhibition of CDK1 with roscovitine in arsenite-treated mitotic cells inhibited spindle checkpoint maintenance as inferred from reduced BUBR1 phosphorylation, reduced cyclin B expression, and diminution of mitotic index. Roscovitine also reduced BCL-2 Ser70 phosphorylation and protected against apoptosis, suggesting mitotic arrest caused by hyperactivation of CDK1 directly or indirectly leads to BCL-2 phosphorylation and apoptosis. In addition, suppression of BUBR1 with siRNA prevented arsenite-induced mitotic arrest and apoptosis. These findings provide insight into the mechanism of arsenic's chemotherapeutic action and indicate a functional spindle checkpoint may be required for arsenic-sensitivity.","['McNeely, Samuel C', 'Taylor, B Frazier', 'States, J Christopher']","['McNeely SC', 'Taylor BF', 'States JC']","['Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Center for Environmental Genomics and Integrative Biology, Center for Genetics and Molecular Medicine and Brown Cancer Center, University of Louisville, 570 S.

However, the degree of risk and types of second cancers detected have been inconsistent in previous studies. PATIENTS AND METHODS: To further characterize the risk for malignancy associated with CTCL, patients treated for CTCL at M. D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, Texas, between November 1979 and November 1999 were assessed for the occurrence of additional cancers by analysis of institutional tumor registry data. RESULTS: Of 672 patients with CTCL, 112 had > or = 1 additional cancer, 37 occurring after the diagnosis of CTCL. This represents a significant elevation in cancer prevalence and incidence, with a 1.79-fold risk (95% CI, 1.22-2.39) for developing cancer after CTCL. An excess of Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma, acute myeloid leukemia, and vulvar cancers was seen. CONCLUSION: These data provide evidence for an increased overall incidence of second malignancy in CTCL, particularly with respect to other lymphoproliferative malignancies. Appropriate monitoring for the early detection of second cancers might be warranted in patients with CTCL.","['Brownell, Isaac', 'Etzel, Carol J', 'Yang, Deborah J', 'Taylor, Sarah H', 'Duvic, Madeleine']","['Brownell I', 'Etzel CJ', 'Yang DJ', 'Taylor SH', 'Duvic M']","['Department of Dermatology, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Clin Lymphoma Myeloma,Clinical lymphoma & myeloma,101256500,,IM,"['Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell, Cutaneous/*complications', 'Male', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*epidemiology', 'Risk Factors']",2008/05/27 09:00,2008/08/06 09:00,['2008/05/27 09:00'],"['2008/05/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/06 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1557-9190(11)70223-2 [pii]', '10.3816/CLM.2008.n.011 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Lymphoma Myeloma. 2008 Apr;8(2):100-5. doi: 10.3816/CLM.2008.n.011.,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the concept of stem cells in leukemia has received significant attention for more than the past decade, over the past several years, expression of several surface markers on cancer cells has led to identification of tumor-initiating cells in several solid tumors, including melanoma, brain, breast, prostate, liver, pancreatic, ovarian, and recently, colon cancer.

Repression and activation of transcriptional control have been reported, but it is currently unclear how Evi1 may evoke these opposing effects. Using a yeast two-hybrid screen, we identified a novel binding partner of Evi1, i.e., methyl binding domain 3b (Mbd3b) protein, a member of the Mi-2/NuRD histone deacetylase complex. Applying in vitro and in vivo assays, we found that Evi1 interacts with Mbd3b but not with other MBD family members Mbd1, -2, and -4 or MeCP2. We show that interaction of Evi1 with Mbd3 requires 40 amino acids that are adjacent and downstream of the methyl binding domain (MBD). We further demonstrate that the first three zinc fingers of Evi1 are needed for Mbd3 interaction. Evi1 acts as a transcriptional repressor when recruited to an active promoter, yet when present in the Mi-2/NuRD complex through Mbd3 interaction, it inhibits the histone deacetylation function of this multiprotein structure.

METHODS: Case report of a 34-year-old woman who underwent bone marrow transplantation for chronic myelogenous leukemia. Four months after the transplant, while on relatively high doses of immunosuppressive drugs, she developed bilateral multifocal retinitis versus leukemic retinal infiltration. Fine-needle aspiration biopsy was performed on one eye in an attempt to establish a cytological diagnosis. RESULTS: The aspirate was found to contain individual crescent-shaped intraretinal organisms and cysts, consistent with the diagnosis of toxoplasmic retinitis. The patient was started immediately on an anti-toxoplasmosis regimen consisting of sulfadiazine, pyrimethamine, and folinic acid. Follow-up examinations revealed complete inactivation of the retinitis and no delayed complications of the biopsy.

Here, we assessed the prevalence of lymphomas in a large SSc cohort. We analyzed data of 218 Hungarian patients undergoing follow-ups in our institutions between 1995 and 2007. During this follow-up period, there were three SSc patients, who eventually developed B cell lymphoma. The first case is a woman with diffuse cutaneous form of SSc (dcSSc) including pulmonary, cardiac, gastrointestinal, and renal manifestations and anti-topoisomerase I antibody positivity. B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) with Zap70 expression (Rai I stage) developed 2 years after the onset of SSc. The second case is a woman with dcSSc presenting with pulmonary, cardiac, and gastroesophageal manifestations. Twenty-one months after disease onset, a chronic small lymphocytic B cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma was diagnosed from retroperitoneal lymph nodes. Our third case is a woman with dcSSc and no internal organ manifestations. She also developed Zap70-positive B-CLL, stage Rai I 9 months after the onset of SSc. Thus, there were three cases of B cell lymphoma among our 218 SSc patients (1.38%). The association of scleroderma and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma may be a rather uncommon feature; however, the incidence of lymphoma among Hungarian SSc patients may be 1.9-2.5 times higher than that in the general population. In our three patients, B cell lymphoma developed within 2 years after the onset of SSc. Altered B cell function implicated in the pathogenesis of SSc may lead to the development of lymphoid malignancies.","['Szekanecz, Eva', 'Szamosi, Szilvia', 'Gergely, Lajos', 'Keszthelyi, Peter', 'Szekanecz, Zoltan', 'Szucs, Gabriella']","['Szekanecz E', 'Szamosi S', 'Gergely L', 'Keszthelyi P', 'Szekanecz Z', 'Szucs G']","['Department of Oncology, University of Debrecen Medical Center, Debrecen, Hungary.']",,['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Clin Rheumatol,Clinical rheumatology,8211469,,IM,"['Aged', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hungary/epidemiology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*complications/epidemiology', 'Middle Aged', 'Prevalence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Scleroderma, Systemic']",2008/05/27 09:00,2009/01/15 09:00,['2008/05/27 09:00'],"['2008/04/08 00:00 [received]', '2008/04/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/04/26 00:00 [revised]', '2008/05/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/15 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/27 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s10067-008-0925-x [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Rheumatol. 2008 Sep;27(9):1163-6. doi: 10.1007/s10067-008-0925-x.

Fifty-three patients who received cytarabine at a dose of 3 g/m2 every 12 h for 4 days after receiving TBI (12 Gy) as a conditioning for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) were evaluated. For the prophylaxis of kerato-conjunctivitis, all patients received betamethasone sodium phosphate eye drops every 6 h, starting 1 day before the first dose of cytarabine and continuing until 1 day after the last dose of cytarabine or the complete resolution of ocular symptoms. For grading of kerato-conjuncitivitis, the National Cancer Institute-Common Toxicity Criteria were used. Among the 53 patients, the grades of kerato-conjunctivitis were grade 0 in 13 patients, grade 1 in 6 patients (11.3%), grade 2 in 10 patients (18.9%) and grade 3 in 25 patients (47.2%).

No beneficial influence of palifermin on the incidence and severity of acute GVHD (aGVHD) was apparent. The incidence and duration of febrile neutropenia, documented infections, hematopoietic recovery or overall survival remained unchanged.

EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: The APL blasts from leukaemia patients and NB4 cells were cotreated with auroanofin and all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) at suboptimal concentration. The HL-60 cells were treated with auroanofin and a subeffective dose of 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2 vit D3) in combination. The effect of auroanofin was investigated on histone acetylation at the promoter of differentiation-associated genes and expression of cell cycle regulators. KEY RESULTS: Treatment with auroanofin and ATRA cooperatively induced granulocytic differentiation of fresh APL blasts isolated from patients and NB4 cells. The combined treatment also increased reorganization of nuclear PML bodies and histone acetylation at the promoter of the RARbeta2 gene. Auroanofin also promoted monocytic differentiation of the HL-60 cells triggered by subeffective concentration of 1,25(OH)2 vit D3. The combined treatment of auroanofin and 1,25(OH)2 vit D3 stimulated histone acetylation at p21 promoters and increased the accumulation of cells in the G0/G1 phase. Consistent with this, the expressions of p21, p27 and PTEN were increased and the levels of cyclin A, Cdk2 and Cdk4 were decreased. Furthermore, the hypophosphorylated form of pRb was markedly increased in cotreated cells. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: These findings indicate that auroanofin in combination with low doses of either ATRA or 1,25(OH)2 vit D3 promotes APL cell differentiation by enhancing histone acetylation and the expression of differentiation-associated genes.","['Park, S J', 'Kim, M', 'Kim, N H', 'Oh, M K', 'Cho, J K', 'Jin, J Y', 'Kim, I S']","['Park SJ', 'Kim M', 'Kim NH', 'Oh MK', 'Cho JK', 'Jin JY', 'Kim IS']","['1Department of Natural Sciences, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, South Korea.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Pharmacol,British journal of pharmacology,7502536,"['0 (Antirheumatic Agents)', '0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (RARA protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '0 (retinoic acid receptor beta)', '3H04W2810V (Auranofin)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (Oncogene Protein p21(ras))', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)']",IM,"['Acetylation/drug effects', 'Adult', 'Antirheumatic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Auranofin/*pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Calcitriol/*physiology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Child', 'Chromatin/metabolism', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Granulocytes/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Histones/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oncogene Protein p21(ras)/genetics', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/genetics/metabolism', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha', 'Tretinoin/*physiology']",2008/05/27 09:00,2008/12/17 09:00,['2008/05/27 09:00'],"['2008/05/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['bjp2008197 [pii]', '10.1038/bjp.2008.197 [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Pharmacol. 2008 Jul;154(6):1196-205. doi: 10.1038/bjp.2008.197.

For HIV-2, the envelope (Env) protein replaces the role of Vpu. Both Vpu and HIV-2 Env enhance virus release by counteracting an innate host-cell block within human cells that is absent in African green monkey (AGM) cells. Here we identify calcium-modulating cyclophilin ligand (CAML) as a Vpu-interacting host factor that restricts HIV-1 release. Expression of human CAML (encoded by CAMLG) in AGM cells conferred a strong restriction of virus release that was reversed by Vpu and HIV-2 Env, suggesting that CAML is the mechanistic link between these two viral regulators. Depletion of CAML in human cells eliminated the need for Vpu in enhancing HIV-1 and murine leukemia virus release. These results point to CAML as a Vpu-sensitive host restriction factor that inhibits HIV release from human cells. The ability of CAML to inhibit virus release should illuminate new therapeutic strategies against HIV.","['Varthakavi, Vasundhara', 'Heimann-Nichols, Ellen', 'Smith, Rita M', 'Sun, Yuehui', 'Bram, Richard J', 'Ali, Showkat', 'Rose, Jeremy', 'Ding, Lingmei', 'Spearman, Paul']","['Varthakavi V', 'Heimann-Nichols E', 'Smith RM', 'Sun Y', 'Bram RJ', 'Ali S', 'Rose J', 'Ding L', 'Spearman P']","['Department of Pediatrics, Division of Infectious Diseases, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, 1161 21st Avenue South, D-7235 MCN, Nashville, Tennessee 37232-2581, USA. vasundhara.varthakavi@vanderbilt.edu']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Retracted Publication']",United States,Nat Med,Nature medicine,9502015,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (CAMLG protein, human)', '0 (Human Immunodeficiency Virus Proteins)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Viral Regulatory and Accessory Proteins)', '0 (vpu protein, Human immunodeficiency virus 1)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/genetics/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'COS Cells', 'Cell Line', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Electroporation', 'Gene Deletion', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/metabolism', 'HIV-1/genetics/*metabolism', 'HeLa Cells', 'Human Immunodeficiency Virus Proteins/genetics/*metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Humans', 'Ligands', 'Plasmids', 'T-Lymphocytes/ultrastructure/virology', 'Transfection', 'Viral Regulatory and Accessory Proteins/genetics/*metabolism/ultrastructure']",2008/05/27 09:00,2008/07/12 09:00,['2008/05/27 09:00'],"['2007/12/14 00:00 [received]', '2008/04/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/05/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/12 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['nm1778 [pii]', '10.1038/nm1778 [doi]']",ppublish,Nat Med. 2008 Jun;14(6):641-7. doi: 10.1038/nm1778.

Prolymphocytes appear relatively unfamiliar in cytopathology practice, and, particularly when present in body fluids, may resemble blasts or adult T-cell leukemia/ lymphoma (ATLL) cells. CASE: A 32-year-old man, referred to us with a diagnosis of acute leukemia, presented with shortness of breath for 2 months and loss of appetite for 3 months. He had enlarged liver and spleen, 6 and 8 cm, respectively, below the costal margin and pleural effusion. The raised total leukocyte count chiefly comprised prolymphocytes that, especially in the pleural fluid, had prominent nucleoli and significant pleomorphism, raising the possibility of blasts or ATLL. CONCLUSION: Prolymphocytes in body fluids can be misinterpreted as blasts or even ATLL cells. Better awareness among cytopathologists about prolymphocytes and the disease states in which they occur, as well as insistence, in a clinical setting of leukemia, on interpreting the pleural fluid in relation to the clinical and laboratory findings, especially those of the peripheral blood and bone marrow, can prevent misdiagnosis. Equally importantly, immunophenotyping must be done in such situations.","['Anand, Mona', 'Sharma, Shruti', 'Kumar, Rajive', 'Raina, Vinod']","['Anand M', 'Sharma S', 'Kumar R', 'Raina V']","['Laboratory Oncology Unit, Institute Rotary Cancer Hospital, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.']",,['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Switzerland,Acta Cytol,Acta cytologica,0370307,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'CHOP protocol']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Diagnostic Errors/*prevention & control', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunophenotyping/methods', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/immunology/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Prolymphocytic, T-Cell/drug therapy/immunology/*pathology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/immunology/*pathology', 'Male', 'Pleural Effusion, Malignant/drug therapy/immunology/*pathology', 'Precursor Cells, T-Lymphoid/immunology/*pathology', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",2008/05/27 09:00,2008/06/18 09:00,['2008/05/27 09:00'],"['2008/05/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/18 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/27 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1159/000325493 [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Cytol. 2008 Mar-Apr;52(2):251-4. doi: 10.1159/000325493.,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RFC as a double edged sword in folate homeostasis.,20687-95,10.1074/jbc.M802812200 [doi],"The reduced folate carrier (RFC), a bidirectional anion transporter, is the major uptake route of reduced folates essential for a spectrum of biochemical reactions and thus cellular proliferation. However, here we show that ectopic overexpression of the RFC, but not of folate receptor alpha, a high affinity unidirectional folate uptake route serving here as a negative control, resulted in an approximately 15-fold decline in cellular viability in medium lacking folates but not in folate-containing medium. Moreover to explore possible mechanisms of adaptation to folate deficiency in various cell lines that express the endogenous RFC, we first determined the gene expression status of the following genes: (a) RFC, (b) ATP-driven folate exporters (i.e. MRP1, MRP5, and breast cancer resistance protein), and (c) folylpoly-gamma-glutamate synthetase and gamma-glutamate hydrolase (GGH), enzymes catalyzing folate polyglutamylation and hydrolysis, respectively. Upon 3-7 days of folate deprivation, semiquantitative reverse transcription-PCR analysis revealed a specific approximately 2.5-fold decrease in RFC mRNA levels in both breast cancer and T-cell leukemia cell lines that was accompanied by a consistent fall in methotrexate influx, serving here as an RFC transport activity assay. Likewise a 2.4-fold decrease in GGH mRNA levels and approximately 19% decreased GGH activity was documented for folate-deprived breast cancer cells. These results along with those of a novel mathematical biomodeling devised here suggest that upon severe short term (i.e. up to 7 days) folate deprivation RFC transport activity becomes detrimental as RFC, but not ATP-driven folate exporters, efficiently extrudes folate monoglutamates out of cells. Hence down-regulation of RFC and GGH may serve as a novel adaptive response to severe folate deficiency.","['Ifergan, Ilan', 'Jansen, Gerrit', 'Assaraf, Yehuda G']","['Ifergan I', 'Jansen G', 'Assaraf YG']","['The Fred Wyszkowski Cancer Research Laboratory, Department of Biology, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Membrane Transport Proteins)', '0 (Oligonucleotides)', '0 (Reduced Folate Carrier Protein)', '0 (SLC19A1 protein, human)', '935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Breast Neoplasms/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival', 'Cricetinae', 'Cricetulus', 'Folic Acid/*chemistry', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Membrane Transport Proteins/metabolism/*physiology', 'Models, Biological', 'Models, Theoretical', 'Oligonucleotides/chemistry', 'Reduced Folate Carrier Protein', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2008/05/24 09:00,2008/09/09 09:00,['2008/05/24 09:00'],"['2008/05/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/09 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(19)54690-7 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M802812200 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2008 Jul 25;283(30):20687-95. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M802812200.

The Zizimin subfamily is composed of three members: Dock9, Dock10, and Dock11. We have identified DOCK10 as an interleukin-4 (IL4)-inducible gene in chronic lymphocytic leukemias (CLLs). Subsequently, we have obtained the full-length cDNA sequence, which encodes a 2180 amino acid protein. Dock9 (2069 amino acids) and Dock11 (2073 amino acids) share more identity between them (58%) than with Dock10 (52% and 50%, respectively). Among normal human tissues, DOCK10 and DOCK11 mRNAs were mainly expressed in peripheral blood (PB) leukocytes. Dock10 protein was expressed at similar levels in normal PB-B and PB-T cells. Dock10 protein levels were heterogeneous in CLLs. IL4 consistently increased Dock10 mRNA and protein levels in CLL and normal PB-B cells. In contrast, IL4 did not affect the levels of Dock10 expression in normal PB-T cells. IL4 neither increased DOCK9 or DOCK11 mRNA levels in CLL cells. Dock10 protein distributed in the cytoplasm and nucleus of CLL cells, and IL4 increased its expression in both cellular compartments. The rapid and distinctive induction of Dock10 expression by IL4 in CLL and normal PB-B cells suggests a role for Dock10 in IL4-induced B-cell activation. Dock10 could represent a point of convergence for IL4 signalling and small Rho GTPase function in B cells.","['Yelo, Estefania', 'Bernardo, Maria Victoria', 'Gimeno, Lourdes', 'Alcaraz-Garcia, Maria Jose', 'Majado, Maria Juliana', 'Parrado, Antonio']","['Yelo E', 'Bernardo MV', 'Gimeno L', 'Alcaraz-Garcia MJ', 'Majado MJ', 'Parrado A']","['Servicio de Inmunologia, Hospital Universitario Virgen de la Arrixaca, Ctra.

Some particles involved in the regulation of an immune system might represent prognostic value for B-CLL. Recently we found no correlation between HLA-G on messenger and protein level, suggesting that HLA-G is released in soluble form. To confront this hypothesis we characterized soluble HLA-G (sHLA-G) by the prognostic factors in the first cohort of 34 CLL patients. No correlation was observed between sHLA-G levels in ZAP-70(+) and ZAP-70(-) CLL as well as in CD38(+) CLL and CD38(-) CLL patients. Next, we wondered whether gene expression of HLA-G, which represent the whole HLA-G pool in the cell, posses prognostic value for CLL. In the second cohort of 41 CLL patients we assessed messenger levels of HLA-G by the strongest prognostic factors in CLL including cytogenetics, IgVH mutational status, ZAP-70 as well as CD38. No changes of HLA-G expression levels were found in different CLL groups characterized by IgVH gene mutational status, ZAP-70 as well as CD38. We observed no differences in expression of HLA-G in various cytogenetic groups of CLL including del17p, del13q, del11q, +8q, +3q, del14q and del6q when compared to those with normal karyotype or with 12+. Both, mRNA expression of HLA-G and levels of its soluble form in plasma bring no additional prognostic value for B-CLL patients.","['Giannopoulos, K', 'Schmitt, M', 'Kowal, M', 'Wlasiuk, P', 'Bojarska-Junak, A', 'Rolinski, J', 'Dmoszynska, A']","['Giannopoulos K', 'Schmitt M', 'Kowal M', 'Wlasiuk P', 'Bojarska-Junak A', 'Rolinski J', 'Dmoszynska A']","['Clinical Immunology Department, Medical University of Lublin, Lublin, Poland. giannop@tlen.pl']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (HLA-G Antigens)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 13', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17', 'Cohort Studies', 'DNA Primers', 'Female', 'HLA Antigens/*blood/*genetics', 'HLA-G Antigens', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/*blood/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/*immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Messenger/*genetics', 'Sequence Deletion']",2008/05/24 09:00,2009/01/10 09:00,['2008/05/24 09:00'],"['2008/02/04 00:00 [received]', '2008/04/14 00:00 [revised]', '2008/04/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/05/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/10 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0145-2126(08)00205-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2008.04.008 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2008 Dec;32(12):1815-9. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2008.04.008.

However, their ability to inhibit flavivirus replication has not been investigated. Hence the present study was designed to evaluate the antiviral activity of 14 MIBT derivatives against Flaviviruses that are prevalent in India such as Japanese Encephalitis Virus (JEV), Dengue-2 (Den-2) and West Nile viruses (WNV). RESULTS: Amongst the fourteen Mannich bases of MIBT derivatives tested one compound - SCH 16 was able to completely inhibit in vitro Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) and West Nile virus (WNV) replication. However no antiviral activity of SCH 16 was noted against Den-2 virus replication. This compound was able to inhibit 50% of the plaques (IC50) produced by JEV and WNV at a concentration of 16 microgm/ml (0.000025 microM) and 4 microgm/ml (0.000006 microM) respectively. Furthermore, SCH 16 at a concentration of 500 mg/kg body weight administered by oral route twice daily was able to completely (100%) prevent mortality in mice challenged with 50LD50 JEV by the peripheral route. Our experiments to understand the mechanism of action suggest that SCH 16 inhibited JEV replication at the level of early protein translation. CONCLUSION: Only one of the 14 isatin derivatives -SCH 16 exhibited antiviral action on JEV and WNV virus infection in vitro. SCH 16 was also found to completely inhibit JEV replication in vivo in a mouse model challenged peripherally with 50LD50 of the virus. These results warrant further research and development on SCH 16 as a possible therapeutic agent.","['Sebastian, Liba', 'Desai, Anita', 'Shampur, Madhusudana N', 'Perumal, Yogeeswari', 'Sriram, D', 'Vasanthapuram, Ravi']","['Sebastian L', 'Desai A', 'Shampur MN', 'Perumal Y', 'Sriram D', 'Vasanthapuram R']","['Department of Neurovirology, National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro Sciences, Bangalore-560029, India. liba_sebastian@yahoo.co.in']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Virol J,Virology journal,101231645,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Thiosemicarbazones)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antiviral Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Cricetinae', 'Cytopathogenic Effect, Viral/drug effects', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Encephalitis Virus, Japanese/*drug effects/*physiology', 'Encephalitis, Japanese/*drug therapy/virology', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Kinetics', 'Mice', 'Models, Animal', 'Protein Biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Swine', 'Thiosemicarbazones/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Virus Replication/drug effects']",2008/05/24 09:00,2008/07/04 09:00,['2008/05/24 09:00'],"['2008/01/22 00:00 [received]', '2008/05/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/05/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/04 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['1743-422X-5-64 [pii]', '10.1186/1743-422X-5-64 [doi]']",epublish,Virol J. 2008 May 22;5:64. doi: 10.1186/1743-422X-5-64.,,,,,20080522,PMC2408923,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

During normal hematopoiesis, Notch-1 promotes myeloid differentiation through up-regulation of the transcriptional factor PU.1. We therefore speculated that down-regulation of Notch-1 expression might be involved in the leukemogenesis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Here we investigated Notch-1 expression and its association with PU.1-mediated differentiation signaling in AML. The transcriptional level of Notch-1 and PU.1 was evaluated in 6 AML cell lines and 54 AML patient samples using real-time PCR analysis, and Western blot analysis of Notch-1, PU.1 and one of its downstream targets, the M-CSF receptor (MCSFR), was performed to test for confirmation. A significant decrease in the transcription levels of Notch-1 was noted in AML cell lines and patient samples, and decreased Notch-1 protein expression in AML was confirmed by Western blotting. Down-regulation of Notch-1 expression was associated with a decrease in PU.1/MCSFR expression in AML. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed that partial disruption of the Notch-1/PU.1 complex was noted in AML cells. No detectable mutation of Notch-1 (ANK, PEST) and PU.1 (PEST, DBD) was noted by PCR-single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) assay. These results suggest that down-regulation of Notch-1 expression decreases PU.1/MCSFR expression and disrupts the Notch-1/PU.1 complex, which may impede the PU.1-mediated myeloid signaling and contribute to the leukemogenesis of AML.","['Chen, Po-Min', 'Yen, Chueh-Chuan', 'Wang, Wei-Shu', 'Lin, Yu-Jen', 'Chu, Chiau-Jun', 'Chiou, Tzeon-Jye', 'Liu, Jin-Hwang', 'Yang, Muh-Hwa']","['Chen PM', 'Yen CC', 'Wang WS', 'Lin YJ', 'Chu CJ', 'Chiou TJ', 'Liu JH', 'Yang MH']","['Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Medicine, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan R.O.C.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,"['0 (NOTCH1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (proto-oncogene protein Spi-1)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Blotting, Western', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Down-Regulation', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptor, Notch1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Trans-Activators/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transcriptional Activation']",2008/05/24 09:00,2008/07/31 09:00,['2008/05/24 09:00'],"['2008/05/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/31 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/24 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.3892/ijo_32_6_1335 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2008 Jun;32(6):1335-41. doi: 10.3892/ijo_32_6_1335.,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the signalling events that govern CdA-mediated cytotoxicity in leukemia cells remain unclear. We show here that CdA treatment caused Jurkat human T leukemia cells to die via apoptosis in a dose- and time-dependent fashion. Bcl-2 overexpression protected Jurkat T leukemia cells from CdA-induced apoptosis and loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential (Delta Psi m). Furthermore, mitochondria that were isolated from Jurkat T leukemia cells and then exposed to CdA showed a loss of Delta Psi m, indicating that CdA directly compromised outer mitochondrial membrane integrity. CdA treatment of Jurkat T leukemia cells resulted in the activation of caspase-3, -8, and -9, while inhibition of these caspases prevented the CdA-induced loss of Delta Psi m, as well as DNA fragmentation. In addition, caspase-3 inhibition prevented caspase-8 activation while caspase-8 inhibition prevented caspase-9 activation. Death receptor signalling was not involved in CdA-induced apoptosis since cytotoxicity was not affected by FADD-deficiency or antibody neutralization of either Fas ligand or tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL). Taken together, these data suggested that CdA-induced apoptosis in Jurkat T leukemia cells was mediated via a caspase-3-dependent mitochondrial feedback amplification loop. CdA treatment also increased p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAPK) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) phosphorylation in Jurkat T leukemia cells. Although ERK1/2 inhibition did not affect CdA-mediated cytotoxicity, inhibition of p38 MAPK had an enhancing effect, which suggested a cytoprotective function for p38 MAPK. Agents that inhibit p38 MAPK might therefore increase the effectiveness of CdA-based chemotherapy.","['Conrad, David M', 'Robichaud, Matthew R J', 'Mader, Jamie S', 'Boudreau, Robert T M', 'Richardson, Angela M', 'Giacomantonio, Carman A', 'Hoskin, David W']","['Conrad DM', 'Robichaud MR', 'Mader JS', 'Boudreau RT', 'Richardson AM', 'Giacomantonio CA', 'Hoskin DW']","['Department of Microbiology & Immunology, Faculty of Medicine, Dalhousie University, Halifax, Nova Scotia, B3H 1X5, Canada.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Fas-Associated Death Domain Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 3/*metabolism', 'Cladribine/*pharmacology', 'Fas-Associated Death Domain Protein/metabolism', '*Feedback, Physiological', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction']",2008/05/24 09:00,2008/07/31 09:00,['2008/05/24 09:00'],"['2008/05/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/31 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/24 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.3892/ijo_32_6_1325 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2008 Jun;32(6):1325-33. doi: 10.3892/ijo_32_6_1325.,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, approximately 50% of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (B-NHL) patients respond to treatment with this antibody. Novel humanized antibodies target membrane CD20 with enhanced effector properties should improve treatment for a broader patient population with relapsed and refractory disease. A novel chimerized form of the murine anti-CD20 1K1791 exerts more potent antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) activities and induces cell death by a non-caspase dependent process. Humanized mAbs derived from 1K1791 were designed using four different humanization techniques and characterized. In contrast to rituximab or 2F2 (human anti-CD20 mAb), several of these exhibited superior ADCC, CDC, inhibition of cell growth and cell death. There was a wide range of functional differences among the humanized forms of 1K1791 despite a modest replacement of amino acid residues in the CDRs. To determine whether the superior activities exhibited by parental murine mAb 1K1791 were due to differences in VH and VL rearrangement, we analyzed its germline and compared it to other anti-CD20 mAbs. A remarkable conservation of VH and Vk (VL kappa) gene usage was observed in the murine anti-CD20 mAbs. 18/23 used the same germline gene J558.42 and 4/23 used closely related genes of the 'J558' group. Thus, 22/23 belonged to VH1 family. One exception was the mAb 1K1791, which was derived from the VH9.12 germline gene. 1K1791 was also unique in its use of a Vk19/28 family gene whereas most other mAbs (21/23) used Vk4/5 family genes. A formal relationship between the particular germline gene recruitment and antibody functionality has not been established, however, the present findings identified humanized mAbs with functional activities that were superior to rituximab and 2F2. These in vitro results support future in vivo animal testing and subsequent clinical trials.","['Nishida, Michio', 'Teshigawara, Keisuke', 'Niwa, Otsura', 'Usuda, Sadakazu', 'Nakamura, Tetsuo', 'Ralph, Peter', 'Newman, Roland', 'Padlan, Eduardo A']","['Nishida M', 'Teshigawara K', 'Niwa O', 'Usuda S', 'Nakamura T', 'Ralph P', 'Newman R', 'Padlan EA']","['Late Effects Studies, Radiation Biology Center, Kyoto University, Kyoto 606-8501, Japan. minishida@aol.com']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD20)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Light Chains)', '9007-36-7 (Complement System Proteins)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*pharmacology', 'Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity', 'Antigens, CD20/*immunology', 'Apoptosis', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Complement System Proteins/metabolism', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Light Chains/*genetics', 'Leukemia/genetics/immunology/therapy', 'Lymphoma/genetics/immunology/therapy', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Necrosis', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid']",2008/05/24 09:00,2008/07/31 09:00,['2008/05/24 09:00'],"['2008/05/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/31 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/24 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.3892/ijo_32_6_1263 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2008 Jun;32(6):1263-74. doi: 10.3892/ijo_32_6_1263.,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, a selective Abl kinase inhibitor, Imatinib mesylate, was introduced as a first line therapy for CML. Despite the initial response, CML patients develop a resistantance to Imatinib, which is mediated mainly by point mutations within the Abl protein. Herein, we describe the identification of mycelium organic extracts of Daedalea gibbosa with selective anti-proliferating and apoptosis-inducing activities against K562 cells and other laboratory model of CML. Using activity-guided purification, we isolated an active fraction, F6, which inhibits in vitro kinase activity of recombinant Abl. The active fraction significantly inhibits the autophosphorylation of native and mutated Bcr-Abl, which are resistant to Imatinib treatment including the T315I mutation. Using a colony-forming assay, we demonstrated that the active fraction is effective in inhibiting the colony formation of the Ba/F3 cell line harboring either native Bcr-Abl or its mutations, including the T315I mutation.

We found that ex vivo spontaneous apoptosis was higher in advanced-stage (III-IV acc. Rai) than in early-stage (I-II acc. Rai) patients.

A comparative assessment of both agents against the human kidney cell line 293T has shown that [Au(II)Hp(-2H).(H(2)O)(2)] is less cytotoxic.

A prominent intracellular gold accumulation was detected after treating tumor cells with [Au(II)Hp(-2H).(H(2)O)(2)] which shows that its putative pharmacological targets are readily accessible after a short incubation period.","['Momekov, Georgi', 'Ferdinandov, Dilyan', 'Konstantinov, Spiro', 'Arpadjan, Sonja', 'Tsekova, Daniela', 'Gencheva, Galina', 'Bontchev, Panayot R', 'Karaivanova, Margarita']","['Momekov G', 'Ferdinandov D', 'Konstantinov S', 'Arpadjan S', 'Tsekova D', 'Gencheva G', 'Bontchev PR', 'Karaivanova M']","['Laboratory of Molecular Pharmacology and Experimental Chemotherapy, Department of Pharmacology, Pharmacotherapy, and Toxicology, Faculty of Pharmacy, Medical University of Sofia, 2 Dunav Street, 1000 Sofia, Bulgaria.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],Egypt,Bioinorg Chem Appl,Bioinorganic chemistry and applications,101200445,,,,2008/05/24 09:00,2008/05/24 09:01,['2008/05/24 09:00'],"['2007/11/22 00:00 [received]', '2008/03/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/05/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/24 09:01 [medline]', '2008/05/24 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1155/2008/367471 [doi]'],ppublish,Bioinorg Chem Appl. 2008:367471. doi: 10.1155/2008/367471.,,,,,,PMC2386889,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While the detailed mechanism of restriction remains unclear, recent studies have implicated the activity of cellular proteasomes in the restriction of retroviral reverse transcription imposed by TRIM5alpha. Here, we show that TRIM5alpha is rapidly degraded upon encounter of a restriction-susceptible retroviral core. Inoculation of TRIM5alpha-expressing human 293T cells with a saturating level of HIV-1 particles resulted in accelerated degradation of the HIV-1-restrictive rhesus macaque TRIM5alpha protein but not the nonrestrictive human TRIM5alpha protein. Exposure of cells to HIV-1 also destabilized the owl monkey restriction factor TRIMCyp; this was prevented by addition of the inhibitor cyclosporin A and was not observed with an HIV-1 virus containing a mutation in the capsid protein that relieves restriction by TRIMCyp IVHIV. Likewise, human TRIM5alpha was rapidly degraded upon encounter of the restriction-sensitive N-tropic murine leukemia virus (N-MLV) but not the unrestricted B-MLV. Pretreatment of cells with proteasome inhibitors prevented the HIV-1-induced loss of both rhesus macaque TRIM5alpha and TRIMCyp proteins. We also detected degradation of endogenous TRIM5alpha in rhesus macaque cells following HIV-1 infection. We conclude that engagement of a restriction-sensitive retrovirus core results in TRIM5alpha degradation by a proteasome-dependent mechanism.","['Rold, Christopher James', 'Aiken, Christopher']","['Rold CJ', 'Aiken C']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, Tennessee, United States of America.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,PLoS Pathog,PLoS pathogens,101238921,"['0 (Antiviral Restriction Factors)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Tripartite Motif Proteins)', '0 (Viral Core Proteins)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (TRIM5 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (TRIM5(alpha) protein, rhesus monkey)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antiviral Restriction Factors', 'Aotidae', 'Carrier Proteins/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cyclosporine/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Gene Silencing', 'HIV-1/physiology', '*Host-Pathogen Interactions', 'Humans', 'Macaca mulatta', '*Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex', 'Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Retroviridae/*physiology', '*Reverse Transcription', 'Transfection', 'Tripartite Motif Proteins', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases', 'Viral Core Proteins/metabolism']",2008/05/24 09:00,2008/08/06 09:00,['2008/05/24 09:00'],"['2007/07/23 00:00 [received]', '2008/04/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/05/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/06 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/24 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1371/journal.ppat.1000074 [doi]'],epublish,PLoS Pathog. 2008 May 23;4(5):e1000074. doi: 10.1371/journal.ppat.1000074.,5,,,"['R56 AI050423/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'T32GM008554/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI050423/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM008554/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'T32AI060571/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI076121/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 AI060571/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI050423/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI76121/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",20080523,PMC2374908,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On the other hand, they contribute significantly to the therapy-related morbidity in this group of patients. The most common complications are catheter-associated infections or thromboses. Here we report on the rare, but potentially life-threatening case of a vessel wall perforation by a CVC. CASE REPORT: A 29-year-old female with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia had a CVC inserted via the left subclavian vein. After two weeks she complained about acute chest pain. Radiology revealed right-sided pleural effusion which was due to a vena cava superior vessel wall perforation by the CVC. Chemotherapy extravasation was excluded by pleural fluid analyses. CONCLUSION: A vessel wall perforation by a CVC is a rare and often late CVC complication with usually unspecific symptoms. Especially patients with leftsided, large-bore catheters are at risk. Awareness of this complication and immediate therapy are essential. We discuss the possible mechanisms and treatment options of this rare CVC complication.","['Jost, Kirsten', 'Leithauser, Malte', 'Grosse-Thie, Christina', 'Bartolomaeus, Anne', 'Hilgendorf, Inken', 'Andree, Holger', 'Casper, Jochen', 'Freund, Mathias', 'Junghanss, Christian']","['Jost K', 'Leithauser M', 'Grosse-Thie C', 'Bartolomaeus A', 'Hilgendorf I', 'Andree H', 'Casper J', 'Freund M', 'Junghanss C']","['Abteilung Hamatologie/Onkologie, Klinik fur Innere Medizin, Universitat Rostock, Germany.']",,['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Switzerland,Onkologie,Onkologie,7808556,,IM,"['Adult', 'Catheterization, Central Venous/*adverse effects', 'Drainage/*methods', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Rare Diseases/etiology/therapy', 'Vena Cava, Superior/*injuries', 'Wounds, Penetrating/*etiology/*therapy']",2008/05/24 09:00,2008/06/21 09:00,['2008/05/24 09:00'],"['2008/05/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/21 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['000122071 [pii]', '10.1159/000122071 [doi]']",ppublish,Onkologie. 2008 May;31(5):262-4. doi: 10.1159/000122071.

Activation of CD40 by its ligand (CD40L) induces proliferation and rescues the cells from spontaneous and chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. CD40 activation also induces secretion of cytokines, such as IL-6, IL-10, TNF-alpha, IL-8, and GM-CSF, which are involved in tumor cell survival, migration, and interaction with cells in the tumor microenvironment. Here we demonstrate that in primary B-CLL tumor cells, the novel antagonist anti-CD40 monoclonal antibody, HCD122, inhibits CD40L-induced activation of signaling pathways, proliferation and survival, and secretion of cytokines. Furthermore, HCD122 is also a potent mediator of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), lysing B-CLL cells more efficiently than rituximab in vitro, despite a significantly higher number of cell surface CD20 binding sites compared with CD40. Unlike rituximab, however, HCD122 (formerly CHIR-12.12) does not internalize upon binding to the cells. Our data suggest that HCD122 may inhibit B-CLL growth by blocking CD40 signaling and by ADCC-mediated cell lysis.","['Luqman, Mohammad', 'Klabunde, Sha', 'Lin, Karen', 'Georgakis, Georgios V', 'Cherukuri, Anu', 'Holash, Jocelyn', 'Goldbeck, Cheryl', 'Xu, Xiaomei', 'Kadel, Edward E 3rd', 'Lee, Sang Hoon', 'Aukerman, Sharon Lea', 'Jallal, Bahija', 'Aziz, Natasha', 'Weng, Wen-Kai', 'Wierda, William', ""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Younes, Anas']","['Luqman M', 'Klabunde S', 'Lin K', 'Georgakis GV', 'Cherukuri A', 'Holash J', 'Goldbeck C', 'Xu X', 'Kadel EE 3rd', 'Lee SH', 'Aukerman SL', 'Jallal B', 'Aziz N', 'Weng WK', 'Wierda W', ""O'Brien S"", 'Younes A']","['Disease Area Oncology, Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research, Emeryville, CA 94608, USA. mohammad.luqman@novartis.com']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CD40 Antigens)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived', 'Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity/drug effects', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Binding Sites', 'CD40 Antigens/*immunology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Rituximab', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects']",2008/05/24 09:00,2008/09/06 09:00,['2008/05/24 09:00'],"['2008/05/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/06 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)60417-7 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2007-04-084756 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2008 Aug 1;112(3):711-20. doi: 10.1182/blood-2007-04-084756.

We studied the effects of inhibition of IL-6 in LNCaP-IL6+ cells, a model system for advanced PC, which produce IL-6. By using the chimeric anti-IL-6 antibody, CNTO 328, we showed that the autocrine IL-6 loop is responsible for decreased sensitivity of LNCaP-IL-6+ cells to die by apoptosis. Dysregulation of Bcl-2 family members could be implicated in the acquisition of resistance to apoptosis in malignant cell lines. Myeloid cell leukemia 1 (Mcl-1) is an antiapoptotic member of this family that is overexpressed in the IL-6 selected cells compared with control. Specific knock-down of Mcl-1 gene expression by siRNA yielded an increase in apoptosis of LNCaP-IL-6+ cells. Interestingly, inactivation of IL-6 autocrine loop was not able to increase apoptosis levels in the absence of Mcl-1, thus suggesting this molecule as a mediator of the survival action of IL-6. Finally, using selective kinase inhibitors we provide evidence for the involvement of p38 and ERK1/2 mitogen-activated protein kinases pathways in the IL-6-mediated regulation of Mcl-1. In conclusion, these data suggest that endogenous IL-6 acts as an antiapoptotic factor in LNCaP-IL-6+ cells and that Mcl-1 is critical for its survival activity. CNTO 328, in our experimental conditions, is able to render LNCaP-IL-6+ cells more sensitive to apoptosis.

It has recently been demonstrated that VPA could promote neurite outgrowth, activate the extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway, and increase B-cell lymphoma/leukemia-2 (bcl-2)and growth cone-associated protein 43 (GAP-43) levels in spinal cord. We hypothesized that VPA could enhance axonal regeneration in the rat. In the present research, we demonstrate the effect of VPA on peripheral nerve regeneration and recovery of motor function through a silicon tube implanted with VPA. The left sciatic nerves were exposed through dorsal-splitting incisions, and 8-mm nerve sections were excised at the middle of the thigh. Then, a 1.0-cm-long silicone tube (internal diameter,1.0 mm; exterior diameter, 2.0 mm) was used to bridge the nerve deficit, anchored to the proximal and distal terminals of the excised deficit of sciatic nerves with 9-0 nylon epineural suture. Sterile petroleum jelly was used to seal the ends of the tubes to avoid leakage. The rats in the VPA group and control group were locally delivered 10 muL VPA injection (400 mg/5 mL) and normal saline, respectively, after the operation. The sciatic nerve index (SFI) was observed in each animal at 2-week intervals and electrophysiology was studied at 4-week intervals for 12 weeks. Histological and morphometrical analyses were performed at the end of the experiment (12 weeks after the operation). Using the digital image-analysis system, the thickness of the myelin sheath was measured, and total numbers of regenerated axons were counted. There was a significant difference in SFI, electrophysiological index (motor-nerve conduct velocity, amplitude of activity potential), and morphometrical results (regenerated axon number and thickness of myelin sheath) in nerve regeneration between the VPA group and controls ( P < 0.05). The results demonstrated that VPA is able to enhance sciatic nerve regeneration in rats, suggesting the potential clinical application of VPA for the treatment of peripheral nerve injury in humans.","['Wu, Fei', 'Xing, Danmou', 'Peng, Zhengren', 'Rao, Ting']","['Wu F', 'Xing D', 'Peng Z', 'Rao T']","[""Department of Hand Surgery and Microsurgery, Pu Ai Hospital of Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan City, Hu Bei Province, People's Republic of China.""]",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Reconstr Microsurg,Journal of reconstructive microsurgery,8502670,"['614OI1Z5WI (Valproic Acid)', 'Z4152N8IUI (Silicon)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Male', 'Nerve Regeneration/*drug effects/physiology', 'Prostheses and Implants', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Sciatic Nerve/injuries/*physiopathology', 'Silicon/*pharmacology', 'Statistics, Nonparametric', 'Valproic Acid/*pharmacology']",2008/05/23 09:00,2008/12/17 09:00,['2008/05/23 09:00'],"['2008/05/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/23 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1055/s-2008-1078696 [doi]'],ppublish,J Reconstr Microsurg. 2008 May;24(4):267-76. doi: 10.1055/s-2008-1078696.

Specific immune reactions are likely to be particularly relevant to the long-term treatment of diseases, such as chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML), in which residual cells may remain quiescent and unresponsive to cytotoxic and molecular therapies for long periods of time. Specific GvL effects result from the expression on leukaemic cells of specific tumour-associated antigens (TAAs) in the context of HLA proteins. As human leukocyte antigen (HLA) types vary widely, the development of broadly applicable tumour vaccines will require the identification of multiple TAAs active in different HLA backgrounds. Here, we describe the identification of NM23-H2 as a novel HLA-A32-restricted TAA of CML cells and demonstrate the presence of specifically reactive T cells in a patient 5 years after transplantation. As the NM23 proteins are aberrantly expressed in a range of different tumours, our findings suggest potential applications beyond CML and provide a new avenue of investigation into the molecular mechanisms underlying CML.","['Tschiedel, S', 'Gentilini, C', 'Lange, T', 'Wolfel, C', 'Wolfel, T', 'Lennerz, V', 'Stevanovic, S', 'Rammensee, H-G', 'Huber, C', 'Cross, M', 'Niederwieser, D']","['Tschiedel S', 'Gentilini C', 'Lange T', 'Wolfel C', 'Wolfel T', 'Lennerz V', 'Stevanovic S', 'Rammensee HG', 'Huber C', 'Cross M', 'Niederwieser D']","['Department of Hematology and Internal Oncology, University of Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (NM23 Nucleoside Diphosphate Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.4.6 (NME2 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antigen-Presenting Cells/immunology', 'DNA, Complementary', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*immunology/surgery', 'Male', 'NM23 Nucleoside Diphosphate Kinases/genetics/*immunology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology']",2008/05/23 09:00,2008/09/13 09:00,['2008/05/23 09:00'],"['2008/05/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/13 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['leu2008107 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2008.107 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2008 Aug;22(8):1542-50. doi: 10.1038/leu.2008.107.

Megakaryocyte (CFU-MK) colony formation occurred in the absence of added cytokines in cultures of peripheral blood from affected family members. Some reports of familial ET have identified mutations in THPO and MPL, the genes for a cytokine (thrombopoietin, TPO) that regulates platelet production and its receptor (c-MPL), respectively. In this family, the MPL gene was excluded by linkage analysis. Although TPO levels were elevated in most affected family members and evidence for linkage was found between the disease and THPO (theta=0.0, Z(max)=3.0), a THPO mutation was not identified by DNA sequencing. The JAK2 V617F mutation that has been associated with 50% of sporadic cases of ET was identified as a somatic mutation, an acquired defect, in peripheral blood of the two most severely affected family members.

Here, we addressed the leukemogenic potential of vectors expressing interleukin-2 receptor common gamma-chain (IL2RG), the coding sequence required for correction of X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency. Similar to conventional gamma-retroviral vectors, self-inactivating (SIN) vectors with strong internal enhancers also triggered profound clonal imbalance, yet with a characteristic insertion preference for a window located downstream of the transcriptional start site. Controls including lentivirally transduced cells revealed that ectopic IL2RG expression was not sufficient to trigger leukemia. After serial bone marrow transplantation involving 106 C57Bl6/J mice monitored for up to 18 months, we observed leukemic progression of six distinct clones harboring gamma-retroviral long terminal repeat (LTR) or SIN vector insertions in Evi1 or Prdm16, two functionally related genes. Three leukemic clones had single vector integrations, and identical clones manifested with a remarkably similar latency and phenotype in independent recipients. We conclude that upregulation of Evi1 or Prdm16 was sufficient to initiate a leukemogenic cascade with consistent intrinsic dynamics. Our study also shows that insertional mutagenesis is required for leukemia induction by IL2RG vectors, a risk to be addressed by improved vector design.","['Modlich, U', 'Schambach, A', 'Brugman, M H', 'Wicke, D C', 'Knoess, S', 'Li, Z', 'Maetzig, T', 'Rudolph, C', 'Schlegelberger, B', 'Baum, C']","['Modlich U', 'Schambach A', 'Brugman MH', 'Wicke DC', 'Knoess S', 'Li Z', 'Maetzig T', 'Rudolph C', 'Schlegelberger B', 'Baum C']","['Department of Experimental Hematology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein)', '0 (Mecom protein, mouse)', '0 (Prdm16 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', '*Genetic Vectors', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*genetics', 'MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mutagenesis, Insertional', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Proto-Oncogenes/*genetics', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Up-Regulation']",2008/05/23 09:00,2008/09/13 09:00,['2008/05/23 09:00'],"['2008/05/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/13 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['leu2008118 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2008.118 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2008 Aug;22(8):1519-28. doi: 10.1038/leu.2008.118.

Tipifarnib is a specific and potent farnesyltransferase inhibitor that demonstrates in vivo and in vitro activity against a variety of human cancers. Although tipifarnib was initially thought to target the Ras protein, recent evidence suggests that the presence of ras mutations is not necessary for the antitumor effects of tipifarnib, and that tipifarnib may exert its effects downstream of Ras. The oral administration and favorable toxicity profile of tipifarnib, combined with its activity in a variety of intracellular pathways that have been implicated in the pathogenesis of hematologic malignancies, make it an especially attractive agent for use in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), myelodysplastic syndromes, chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), and multiple myeloma. Because hematologic malignancies are likely driven by multiple genetic aberrations, the most effective treatment strategy will likely combine multiple agents with complementary mechanisms of action. Thus, additional studies of combination regimens that incorporate tipifarnib with other antineoplastic agents are crucial. Early results from studies combining tipifarnib with imatinib or etoposide in CML and AML have been promising and warrant further evaluation in larger clinical trials.","['Martinelli, Giovanni', 'Iacobucci, Ilaria', 'Paolini, Stefania', 'Ottaviani, Emanuela']","['Martinelli G', 'Iacobucci I', 'Paolini S', 'Ottaviani E']","['Institute of Hematology and Medical Oncology, University of Bologna, 40138 Bologna, Italy. giovanni.martinelli2@unibo.it']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Clin Adv Hematol Oncol,Clinical advances in hematology & oncology : H&O,101167661,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Quinolones)', 'EC 2.5.1.29 (Farnesyltranstransferase)', 'MAT637500A (tipifarnib)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Farnesyltranstransferase/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*drug therapy/physiopathology', 'Humans', 'Quinolones/*therapeutic use', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects']",2008/05/23 09:00,2008/07/09 09:00,['2008/05/23 09:00'],"['2008/05/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/09 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/23 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Adv Hematol Oncol. 2008 Apr;6(4):303-10.,4,45,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Extracorporeal Life Support Organization (ELSO) data registry. PATIENTS: All nonneonatal pediatric patients receiving ECLS for respiratory failure. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: As of February 4, 2004, the ELSO registry contained 2,879 pediatric patients between 1 month and 19 yrs of age who were treated with ECLS for respiratory failure. Overall, 183 patients had at least one International Classification of Diseases (Ninth Revision) or Current Procedural Terminology code associated with an ICC; ICC status was associated with lower hospital survival (31 vs. 57 %; p < .001). Six ICC subgroups were also examined: immune deficiency, leukemia-lymphoma, cancer, opportunistic infection, solid organ transplant, and bone marrow transplant. Each ICC subgroup was also associated with reduced hospital survival, varying from a high of 34.6% (solid organ transplants) to a low of 0% (bone marrow transplant). In a multivariate logistic regression model that controlled for factors reported to be associated with survival and other respiratory interventions (high-frequency ventilation, inhaled nitric oxide, and surfactant), the presence of an ICC remained associated with reduced hospital survival (odds ratio 0.20-0.45; p < .001). In this multivariate model, an unexpected strong association between inhaled nitric oxide therapy and lower ECLS survival was observed (odds ratio 0.49-0.80; p < .001). CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort of pediatric patients receiving ECLS for respiratory failure, survival to hospital discharge was reduced for each ICC subgroup examined and was approximately one in three for the overall group. Further study of the association of lower survival rates for patients who received inhaled nitric oxide prior to ECLS is needed.","['Gupta, Monika', 'Shanley, Thomas P', 'Moler, Frank W']","['Gupta M', 'Shanley TP', 'Moler FW']","[""University of Louisville, Kosair Children's Hospital, Louisville, KY, USA.""]",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Pediatr Crit Care Med,Pediatric critical care medicine : a journal of the Society of Critical Care Medicine and the World Federation of Pediatric Intensive and Critical Care Societies,100954653,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', '*Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation', 'Female', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Humans', '*Immunocompromised Host', 'Infant', '*Life Support Systems', 'Male', 'Respiratory Insufficiency/*mortality/*therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Sex Factors']",2008/05/23 09:00,2009/03/10 09:00,['2008/05/23 09:00'],"['2008/05/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/03/10 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/23 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/PCC.0b013e318172d54d [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Crit Care Med. 2008 Jul;9(4):380-5. doi: 10.1097/PCC.0b013e318172d54d.,4,,,,,,,,,,"['Pediatr Crit Care Med. 2008 Jul;9(4):442-4.

One of the adverse effects of glucocorticoids is hypertension. Our aim was to define the frequency of and clinical and genetic risk factors for steroid-induced hypertension. METHODS: We determined the genotypes for 203 candidate polymorphisms in genes previously linked to hypertension or to the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of antileukemic agents. Hypertension was defined according to the guidelines of the American Academy of Pediatrics; patients were evaluated during the 28-day period of prednisone at 40 mg/m2/day during remission induction of childhood ALL. RESULTS: Of the 602 children with newly diagnosed ALL who were normotensive pretherapy, 270 (45%) developed hypertension during remission induction. None of the putative risk factors (age, sex, race, white blood cell count, risk group, body mass index, or serum creatinine) was associated with hypertension. Among the polymorphisms genotyped, we identified eight genes (CNTNAP2, LEPR, CRHR1, NTAN1, SLC12A3, ALPL, BGLAP, and APOB) containing variants that were associated with hypertension (chi2 P values 0.002-0.048), several of which interact with the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis. Polymorphisms in CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 were not associated with hypertension. CONCLUSION: Hypertension is common during ALL remission induction and is related to germline genetic variation.","['Kamdem, Landry K', 'Hamilton, Leo', 'Cheng, Cheng', 'Liu, Wei', 'Yang, Wenjian', 'Johnson, Julie A', 'Pui, Ching-Hon', 'Relling, Mary V']","['Kamdem LK', 'Hamilton L', 'Cheng C', 'Liu W', 'Yang W', 'Johnson JA', 'Pui CH', 'Relling MV']","[""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee 38105-2794, USA.""]",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Pharmacogenet Genomics,Pharmacogenetics and genomics,101231005,"['0 (Glucocorticoids)', '9035-51-2 (Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (CYP3A protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System/genetics', 'Female', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genotype', 'Glucocorticoids/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Hypertension/*chemically induced/*genetics', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'Regression Analysis']",2008/05/23 09:00,2008/08/14 09:00,['2008/05/23 09:00'],"['2008/05/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/14 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/23 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/FPC.0b013e3282fc5801 [doi]'],ppublish,Pharmacogenet Genomics. 2008 Jun;18(6):507-14. doi: 10.1097/FPC.0b013e3282fc5801.,6,,,"['T32 CA070089/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 36401/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 51001/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32-CA070089/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01GM61374/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'CA21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 GM61393/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Twenty-nine patients with a median age of 62 years (range, 32-84 years) were enrolled at planned dose levels (20, 40, and 80 mg/m(2)). The majority of patients (76%) had acute myelogenous leukemia (AML).

The maximum tolerated dose was determined to be 60 mg/m(2), with dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea observed at higher doses. Three patients achieved a complete bone marrow response (blasts <or= 5%). Pharmacokinetic analyses indicated absorption of MGCD0103 within 1 hour and an elimination half-life in plasma of 9 (+/- 2) hours. Exposure to MGCD0103 was proportional to dose up to 60 mg/m(2). Analysis of peripheral white cells demonstrated induction of histone acetylation and dose-dependent inhibition of HDAC enzyme activity.

Among the family members, Ap2delta is the most divergent, because it lacks highly conserved residues within the transactivation domain (TAD) and has weak affinity for known Ap2 binding sites. To identify specific Ap2delta coactivators/regulators during development, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen, using Ap2delta's TAD. We identified the trithorax superfamily member, Ash2l, as a binding partner that interacts exclusively with Ap2delta. We showed that Ash2l positively mediates Ap2delta transactivation in a dose-dependent manner. Given the known role of Ash2l in histone modification, we determined whether Ap2delta was able to form a complex with that activity. Our results showed that Ap2delta associates with endogenous ASH2L and a member of the MLL family of histone lysine methyltransferases (HKMTs), MLL2 (ALR), forming a complex that methylates lysine 4 of histone H3 (H3K4). Additionally, we showed that Ap2delta is necessary for recruitment of Ash2l and Alr to the Hoxc8 locus and that recruitment of this complex leads to H3K4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) and subsequent gene activation. Altogether, we provide evidence of an association between a highly restricted gene-specific transcription factor and a Su(var), Enhancer of Zeste, Trithorax (SET)1/trithorax-like complex with H3K4 methyltransferase activity. Our studies also document a functional role for Ap2delta in recruiting histone methyltransferases (HMTs) to specific gene targets, such as Hoxc8. This role provides a mechanism through which these transcription factors can have diverse effects despite nearly identical DNA-binding motifs.","['Tan, Cheryl C', 'Sindhu, K V', 'Li, Side', 'Nishio, Hitomi', 'Stoller, Jason Z', 'Oishi, Kimihiko', 'Puttreddy, Sahitya', 'Lee, Tamara J', 'Epstein, Jonathan A', 'Walsh, Martin J', 'Gelb, Bruce D']","['Tan CC', 'Sindhu KV', 'Li S', 'Nishio H', 'Stoller JZ', 'Oishi K', 'Puttreddy S', 'Lee TJ', 'Epstein JA', 'Walsh MJ', 'Gelb BD']","['Departments of Pediatrics, Center for Molecular Cardiology, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, One Gustave L.

Increased expression of nuclear Mcl-1 and/or a previously reported short nuclear form of Mcl-1, snMcl-1, was observed in response to treatment with low concentrations of etoposide or low doses of UV irradiation. We showed that after etoposide treatment, Mcl-1 could coimmunoprecipitate with the regulatory kinase, Chk1. Chk1 is a known regulator of DNA damage response, and its phosphorylation is associated with activation of the kinase. Transient transfection with Mcl-1 resulted in an increase in the expression of phospho-Ser345 Chk1, in the absence of any evidence of DNA damage, and accumulation of cells in G2. Importantly, knockdown of Mcl-1 expression abolished Chk1 phosphorylation in response to DNA damage. Mcl-1 could induce Chk1 phosphorylation in ATM-negative (ataxia telangectasia mutated) cells, but this response was lost in ATR (AT mutated and Rad3 related)-defective cells. Low levels of UV treatment also caused transient increases in Mcl-1 levels and an ATR-dependent phosphorylation of Chk1. Together, our results strongly support an essential regulatory role for Mcl-1, perhaps acting as an adaptor protein, in controlling the ATR-mediated regulation of Chk1 phosphorylation.","['Jamil, Sarwat', 'Mojtabavi, Shadi', 'Hojabrpour, Payman', 'Cheah, Stefanie', 'Duronio, Vincent']","['Jamil S', 'Mojtabavi S', 'Hojabrpour P', 'Cheah S', 'Duronio V']","['Department of Medicine, University of British Columbia and Vancouver Coastal Health Research Institute, Vancouver, BC, V6H 3Z6 Canada.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Biol Cell,Molecular biology of the cell,9201390,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (ATR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (CHEK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Checkpoint Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/pharmacology', 'Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/*metabolism', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Checkpoint Kinase 1', 'DNA Damage', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'HL-60 Cells', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'Subcellular Fractions/metabolism', 'Ultraviolet Rays']",2008/05/23 09:00,2008/12/23 09:00,['2008/05/23 09:00'],"['2008/05/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/23 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['E07-11-1171 [pii]', '10.1091/mbc.e07-11-1171 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Biol Cell. 2008 Aug;19(8):3212-20. doi: 10.1091/mbc.e07-11-1171.

Acute thymic atrophy is a complication of many infections, environmental stressors, clinical preparative regimens, and cancer treatments used today. This undesirable sequela can decrease host ability to reconstitute the peripheral T cell repertoire and respond to new antigens. Currently, there are no treatments available to protect against acute thymic atrophy or accelerate recovery, thus leaving the immune system compromised during acute stress events. Several useful murine models are available for mechanistic studies of acute thymic atrophy, including a sepsis model of endotoxin-induced thymic involution. We have identified the IL-6 cytokine gene family members (i.e., leukemia inhibitory factor, IL-6, and oncostatin M) as thymosuppressive agents by the observation that they can acutely involute the thymus when injected into a young, healthy mouse. We have gone on to explore the role of thymosuppressive cytokines and specifically defined a corticosteroid-dependent mechanism of action for the leukemia inhibitory factor in acute thymic atrophy. We also have identified leptin as a novel, thymostimulatory agent that can protect against endotoxin-induced acute thymic atrophy. This review will highlight mechanisms of stress-induced thymic involution and focus on thymosuppressive agents involved in atrophy induction and thymostimulatory agents that may be exploited for therapeutic use.","['Gruver, Amanda L', 'Sempowski, Gregory D']","['Gruver AL', 'Sempowski GD']","['Department of Pathology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC 27710, USA.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Leptin)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Atrophy', 'Cytokines/immunology/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leptin/immunology/*physiology', 'Life Expectancy', 'Lipopolysaccharides/toxicity', 'Models, Animal', 'Satiety Response', 'Stress, Physiological/*immunology/*physiopathology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Thymus Gland/*pathology']",2008/05/23 09:00,2008/11/05 09:00,['2008/05/23 09:00'],"['2008/05/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/11/05 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['jlb.0108025 [pii]', '10.1189/jlb.0108025 [doi]']",ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 2008 Oct;84(4):915-23. doi: 10.1189/jlb.0108025.

As Tax is known to deregulate various basic bHLH factors, we looked more specifically at its effect on TAL1 (T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia 1), also known as SCL (stem cell leukemia). Indeed, TAL1 is deregulated in a high percentage of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells, and its oncogenic properties are well-established. Here we show that Tax induces transcription of this proto-oncogene by stimulating the activity of the TAL1 gene promoter 1b, through both the CREB and NF-kappaB pathways. It was also observed that TAL1 upregulates HTLV-1 promoter activity, in either the presence or the absence of Tax. The viral promoter is inhibited in trans by expression of the E2A protein E47, and TAL1 is able to abrogate this inhibition. These data show the existence of a positive feedback loop between Tax and TAL1 expression and support the notion that this proto-oncogene participates in generation of adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma by increasing the amount of the Tax oncoprotein but also possibly by its own transforming activities.","['Terme, Jean-Michel', 'Wencker, Melanie', 'Favre-Bonvin, Arnaud', 'Bex, Francoise', 'Gazzolo, Louis', 'Duc Dodon, Madeleine', 'Jalinot, Pierre']","['Terme JM', 'Wencker M', 'Favre-Bonvin A', 'Bex F', 'Gazzolo L', 'Duc Dodon M', 'Jalinot P']","[""Laboratoire de Biologie Moleculaire de la Cellule, UMR5239 CNRS/ENS de Lyon, IFR 128 Biosciences Lyon Gerland, 46 Allee d'Italie, 69364 Lyon cedex 07, France.""]",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (tax protein, Human T-lymphotrophic virus 1)', '135471-20-4 (TAL1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Line', 'Feedback, Physiological', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Gene Products, tax/*metabolism', 'HeLa Cells', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*virology', 'Models, Biological', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'Thymus Gland/cytology']",2008/05/23 09:00,2008/09/03 09:00,['2008/05/23 09:00'],"['2008/05/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/03 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['JVI.02414-07 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.02414-07 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2008 Aug;82(16):7913-22. doi: 10.1128/JVI.02414-07.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: An advancement in vector development now allows the generation of rAAV capsid mutants that offer higher target cell efficiency and specificity. To increase the gene transfer into hematopoietic progenitor cells, we applied this method for the first time on primary human CD34(+) PBPC cells. RESULTS: On a panel of leukemia cell lines (CML/AML), significantly higher gene transfer efficiency of the rAAV capsid mutants (up to 100% gene transfer) was observed compared to standard rAAV2 vectors. A higher transduction efficiency in the imatinib-resistant cell line LAMA84-R than in their sensitive counterpart LAMA84-S and a pronounced difference in susceptibility for the capsid mutants vs rAAV2 in LAMA84-S were particularly striking. On solid tumor cell lines, on the other hand, rAAV2 was more efficient than the capsid mutants, suggesting an increased specificity of our capsid mutants for hematopoietic progenitor cells. On primary human CD34(+) PBPC significantly higher (up to eightfold; 16% green fluorescent protein-positive) gene transfer could be obtained with the newly generated vectors compared to standard rAAV2 vectors. CONCLUSION: These novel vectors may enable efficient gene transfer using rAAV-based vectors into primary human blood progenitor cells for a future clinical application.","['Sellner, Leopold', 'Stiefelhagen, Marius', 'Kleinschmidt, Jurgen A', 'Laufs, Stephanie', 'Wenz, Frederik', 'Fruehauf, Stefan', 'Zeller, W Jens', 'Veldwijk, Marlon R']","['Sellner L', 'Stiefelhagen M', 'Kleinschmidt JA', 'Laufs S', 'Wenz F', 'Fruehauf S', 'Zeller WJ', 'Veldwijk MR']","['Pharmacology of Cancer Treatment (G402), German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Peptide Library)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)']",IM,"['Capsid/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Dependovirus/*genetics', 'Directed Molecular Evolution', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genetic Vectors/*genetics', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism/virology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics/metabolism/virology', 'Mutagenesis', '*Peptide Library', 'Recombinant Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2008/05/23 09:00,2008/09/20 09:00,['2008/05/23 09:00'],"['2007/10/30 00:00 [received]', '2008/02/27 00:00 [revised]', '2008/03/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/05/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/20 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-472X(08)00121-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2008.03.007 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2008 Aug;36(8):957-64. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2008.03.007.

As cathepsin B is a highly predictive indicator for prognosis and diagnosis of cancer, a possible antitumor potential for these new compounds is expected. In this work, it was investigated the effectiveness of organotellurium(IV) RT-04 to produce lethal effects in the human promyelocytic leukaemia cell line HL60. Using the MTT tetrazolium reduction test, and trypan blue exclusion assay, the IC50 for the compound after 24 h incubation was 6.8 and 0.35 microM, respectively. Moreover, the compound was found to trigger apoptosis in HL60 cells, inducing DNA fragmentation and caspase-3, -6, and -9 activations. The apoptsosis-induced by RT-04 is probably related to the diminished Bcl-2 expression, observed by RT-PCR, in HL60-treated cells. In vivo studies demonstrated that the RT-04 treatment (2.76 mg/kg given for three consecutive days) produces no significant toxic effects for bone marrow and spleen CFU-GM. However, higher doses (5.0 and 10 mg/kg) produced a dose-dependent reduction in the number of CFU-GM of RT-04-treated mice. These results suggest that RT-04 is able to induce apoptosis in HL60 cells by Bcl-2 expression down-modulation. Further studies are necessary to better clarify the effects of this compound on bone marrow normal cells.","['Abondanza, T S', 'Oliveira, C R', 'Barbosa, C M V', 'Pereira, F E G', 'Cunha, R L O R', 'Caires, A C F', 'Comasseto, J V', 'Queiroz, M L S', 'Valadares, M C', 'Bincoletto, C']","['Abondanza TS', 'Oliveira CR', 'Barbosa CM', 'Pereira FE', 'Cunha RL', 'Caires AC', 'Comasseto JV', 'Queiroz ML', 'Valadares MC', 'Bincoletto C']","['Universidade de Mogi das Cruzes (UMC), Mogi das Cruzes, Sao Paulo, Brazil.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Food Chem Toxicol,Food and chemical toxicology : an international journal published for the British Industrial Biological Research Association,8207483,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Organometallic Compounds)', '0 (RT-04 compound)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Down-Regulation', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Enzyme Activation', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Genes, bcl-2/*drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Organometallic Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2008/05/23 09:00,2008/08/06 09:00,['2008/05/23 09:00'],"['2007/11/14 00:00 [received]', '2008/04/02 00:00 [revised]', '2008/04/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/05/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/06 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0278-6915(08)00183-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.fct.2008.04.010 [doi]']",ppublish,Food Chem Toxicol. 2008 Jul;46(7):2540-5. doi: 10.1016/j.fct.2008.04.010.

The present data suggest that p190 may be a secondary event in at least some cases of childhood CML, suggesting an association with progression to a blastic crisis in these patients.","['Scrideli, Carlos Alberto', 'de Oliveira, Fabio Morato', 'Brassesco, Maria Sol', 'de Paula Queiroz, Rosane', 'Bernardes, Jose Eduardo', 'Valera, Elvis Terci', 'Tone, Luiz Gonzaga']","['Scrideli CA', 'de Oliveira FM', 'Brassesco MS', 'de Paula Queiroz R', 'Bernardes JE', 'Valera ET', 'Tone LG']","['Department of Pediatrics, Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto, Universidade de Sao Paulo, Avenida Bandeirantes 3900, 14049-900 Ribeirao Preto (SP), Brazil.']",,['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Blast Crisis', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', '*Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics', 'Male', 'RNA, Neoplasm/analysis']",2008/05/23 09:00,2009/02/28 09:00,['2008/05/23 09:00'],"['2008/02/09 00:00 [received]', '2008/04/07 00:00 [revised]', '2008/04/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/05/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/02/28 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0145-2126(08)00186-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2008.04.007 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2009 Mar;33(3):495-9. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2008.04.007.

Studies on HLA-G expression in malignant haematopoietic diseases are controversial, and the functions of HLA-G on this context are limited. In the current study, HLA-G expression was analysed in different types of patients: de novo acute myeloid leukaemia (AML, n = 54), B cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (B-ALL, n= 13), chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML, n= 9) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS, n= 11). HLA-G expression was observed in 18.5% cases of AML, 22.2% in CML and 18.2% in MDS, but not in B-ALL patients. In AML, HLA-G-positive patients had a significant higher bone marrow leukaemic blast cell percentage when compared with that of HLA-G-negative patients (P < 0.01). Total T-cell percentage was dramatically decreased in HLA-G-positive patients (P < 0.05). Cytogenetic karyotyping results showed that all HLA-G-positive AML patients (n= 5) were cytogenetically abnormal, which was markedly different from that of HLA-G-negative patients (P < 0.01). Ex vivo cytotoxicity analysis revealed that HLA-G expression in AML leukaemic cells could directly inhibit NK cell cytolysis (P < 0.01). These findings indicated that HLA-G expression in AML is of unfavourable clinical implications, and that HLA-G could be a potential target for therapy.","['Yan, W-H', 'Lin, A', 'Chen, B-G', 'Luo, W-D', 'Dai, M-Z', 'Chen, X-J', 'Xu, H-H', 'Li, B-L']","['Yan WH', 'Lin A', 'Chen BG', 'Luo WD', 'Dai MZ', 'Chen XJ', 'Xu HH', 'Li BL']","[""Medical Research Center, Taizhou Hospital of Zhejiang province, Wenzhou Medical College, Linhai, Zhejiang, People's Republic of China. yanwhcom@yahoo.com""]",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Cell Mol Med,Journal of cellular and molecular medicine,101083777,"['0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (HLA-G Antigens)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', 'EC 1.1.1.27 (L-Lactate Dehydrogenase)', 'I223NX31W9 (Fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate)']",IM,"['Adult', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Chromosome Banding', 'Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate/metabolism', 'Fluorescent Dyes/metabolism', 'HLA Antigens/*immunology/metabolism', 'HLA-G Antigens', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/*immunology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Karyotyping', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology', 'L-Lactate Dehydrogenase/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/classification/*diagnosis/*immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2008/05/23 09:00,2008/09/18 09:00,['2008/05/23 09:00'],"['2008/05/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/18 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['JCMM175 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1582-4934.2008.00175.x [doi]']",ppublish,J Cell Mol Med. 2008 Jun;12(3):889-98. doi: 10.1111/j.1582-4934.2008.00175.x.,3,,,,,PMC4401132,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All patients had PBF disturbances such as decrease of portal vein blood flow, increase of venous drainage of hepar and spleen. The degree of disturbances intensity increased depending on degree of chronic hepatitis activity (the index of histological activity) and hepatic fibrosis stage. Thus, presence of chronic hepatitis in HB patients regardless of aetiology, is the factor aggravating patients' stage and corrupting PBF.

In this study, more than 33 compounds were identified and then compared with the results obtained in our previous work. Cyperene, alpha-cyperone, isolongifolen-5-one, rotundene, and cyperorotundene were the principal compounds comprising 62% of the oil. An in vitro cytotoxicity assay with MTT indicated that this oil was very effective against L1210 leukaemia cells line. This result correlates with significantly increased apoptotic DNA fragmentation. The oxidative effects of the essential oil were evaluated using the 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), xanthine/xanthine oxidase assays, and the scavenging of superoxide radical assay generated by photo-reduction of riboflavin. The antimutagenic activity of essential oil has been examined by following the inhibition of H(2)O(2) UV photolysis which induced strand-break formation in pBS plasmid DNA scission assay. Based on all these results, it is concluded that C. rotundus essential-oil composition established by GC/MS analysis, in EI- and CI-MS modes, presents a variety of a chemical composition we were not able to detect with only GC/MS analysis in our previous work. This essential oil exhibited antioxidant, cytotoxic, and apoptotic properties.","['Kilani, Soumaya', 'Ledauphin, Jerome', 'Bouhlel, Ines', 'Ben Sghaier, Mohamed', 'Boubaker, Jihed', 'Skandrani, Ines', 'Mosrati, Ridha', 'Ghedira, Kamel', 'Barillier, Daniel', 'Chekir-Ghedira, Leila']","['Kilani S', 'Ledauphin J', 'Bouhlel I', 'Ben Sghaier M', 'Boubaker J', 'Skandrani I', 'Mosrati R', 'Ghedira K', 'Barillier D', 'Chekir-Ghedira L']","['Unite de Pharmacognosie/Biologie Moleculaire 99/UR/07-03, Faculty of Pharmacy, Monastir 5000, Tunisia.']",,['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Switzerland,Chem Biodivers,Chemistry & biodiversity,101197449,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Free Radicals)', '0 (Oils, Volatile)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'EC 1.17.3.2 (Xanthine Oxidase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antioxidants/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cyperus/*chemistry', 'Free Radicals/metabolism', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry/*methods', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Structure', 'Oils, Volatile/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Photochemistry', 'Plant Extracts/chemistry', 'Plasmids/genetics', 'Xanthine Oxidase/metabolism']",2008/05/22 09:00,2008/08/20 09:00,['2008/05/22 09:00'],"['2008/05/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/20 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/22 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cbdv.200890069 [doi]'],ppublish,Chem Biodivers. 2008 May;5(5):729-42. doi: 10.1002/cbdv.200890069.,5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Approximately 150 cases have been reported in the literature, with only one previously documented case of PPB in siblings. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We present the case of two brothers diagnosed with PPB. RESULTS: A two month-old boy with an abnormal breathing pattern was referred for evaluation of a cystic mass discovered on chest radiograph. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest was performed at our institution which revealed findings compatible with congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation (CCAM) of the right middle and lower lobes. The patient underwent urgent thoracic exploration one week later after developing severe respiratory distress. Histological examination revealed PPB type I (cystic). The patient's 15-month-old brother was presumed to have a CCAM noted radiographically months earlier during an asthma exacerbation. He underwent elective cyst resection and was also found to have type I PPB. The index patient was treated with adjuvant chemotherapy due to the large size of the PPB and intraoperative spillage of cystic fluid during the emergent surgery. In contrast, the brother is being followed without adjuvant chemotherapy, given the much smaller size of the PPB, wide margins of resection, and lack of spillage. Family history included an uncle diagnosed at age 11 with an unusual form of T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. CONCLUSION: Although PPB is known to have a familial association with other neoplasms, this case represents only the second report of PPB occurring in siblings. The importance of thoroughly investigating and resecting pulmonary cystic masses in the pediatric population is highlighted by these cases.","['Gutweiler, J R', 'Labelle, J', 'Suh, M Y', 'Misra, M V', 'Ahmed, M', 'Lee, E Y', 'Vargas, S O', 'Kim, H B', 'Weldon, C B']","['Gutweiler JR', 'Labelle J', 'Suh MY', 'Misra MV', 'Ahmed M', 'Lee EY', 'Vargas SO', 'Kim HB', 'Weldon CB']","[""Department of Surgery, Children's Hospital Boston, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.""]",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Eur J Pediatr Surg,European journal of pediatric surgery : official journal of Austrian Association of Pediatric Surgery ...

Febrile neutropenia is a common serious side effect of the cytostatic treatment of malignancies. The clinical use of Granulocyte Colony Stimulating Factor (G-CSF) has become widespread to minimize chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression and febrile neutropenia in childhood solid tumors, acute lymphoid leukaemia (ALL) and in several trials with AML. In case of ALL this seems to be reasonable because, due to the absence of G-CSF receptor (G-CSFR) on the surface of normal lymphoid cells, G-CSF does not have any influence on the pathways of proliferation and differentiation of lymphoid lineage cells. It has been suggested, however, that ALL blasts with B or T cell surface antigens as well as biphenotypic leukaemia cells express G-CSFR, and they are able to respond to exogenously added G-CSF with proliferation. In this study we investigated how G-CSF might influence the sensitivity of leukemic cells to daunorubicin induced cell death using MTT assay, flow cytometry and Western blot analysis. After pretreatment of KG-1 leukaemic cells with G-CSF a moderate increase in the resistance of these cells to daunorubicin could be observed. These results draw attention to the risk of G-CSF application as an adjuvant therapy of childhood ALL. In addition, adjuvant treatment of AML patients with G-CSF in order to prevent neutropenia, or its use in priming regimens might result resistance to daunorubicin.","['Markasz, Laszlo', 'Hajas, Gyorgy', 'Kiss, Andrea', 'Lontay, Beata', 'Rajnavolgyi, Eva', 'Erdodi, Ferenc', 'Olah, Eva']","['Markasz L', 'Hajas G', 'Kiss A', 'Lontay B', 'Rajnavolgyi E', 'Erdodi F', 'Olah E']","['Department of Paediatrics, Medical and Health Science Center, University of Debrecen, Debrecen, Hungary. markaszl@freemail.hu']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Pathol Oncol Res,Pathology oncology research : POR,9706087,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Receptors, Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chemotherapy, Adjuvant', 'Daunorubicin/*therapeutic use', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Myeloid Cells/*drug effects/pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/pathology', 'Receptors, Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/drug effects']",2008/05/22 09:00,2009/03/25 09:00,['2008/05/22 09:00'],"['2008/04/14 00:00 [received]', '2008/04/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/05/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/03/25 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/22 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s12253-008-9057-5 [doi]'],ppublish,Pathol Oncol Res. 2008 Sep;14(3):285-92. doi: 10.1007/s12253-008-9057-5.

The mechanisms involved in the propagation of these structures remain elusive. Fission yeast centromeres are composed of two chromatin domains: the central CENP-A(Cnp1) kinetochore domain and flanking heterochromatin domains. Here we show that fission yeast Mcl1, a DNA polymerase alpha (Pol alpha) accessory protein, is critical for maintenance of centromeric chromatin. In a screen for mutants that alleviate both central domain and outer repeat silencing, we isolated several cos mutants, of which cos1 is allelic to mcl1. The mcl1-101 mutation causes reduced CENP-A(Cnp1) in the central domain and an aberrant increase in histone acetylation in both domains. These phenotypes are also observed in a mutant of swi7(+), which encodes a catalytic subunit of Pol alpha. Mcl1 forms S-phase-specific nuclear foci, which colocalize with those of PCNA and Pol alpha. These results suggest that Mcl1 and Pol alpha are required for propagation of centromere chromatin structures during DNA replication.","['Natsume, Toyoaki', 'Tsutsui, Yasuhiro', 'Sutani, Takashi', 'Dunleavy, Elaine M', 'Pidoux, Alison L', 'Iwasaki, Hiroshi', 'Shirahige, Katsuhiko', 'Allshire, Robin C', 'Yamao, Fumiaki']","['Natsume T', 'Tsutsui Y', 'Sutani T', 'Dunleavy EM', 'Pidoux AL', 'Iwasaki H', 'Shirahige K', 'Allshire RC', 'Yamao F']","['Division of Mutagenesis, National Institute of Genetics, Mishima, Shizuoka, Japan.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Histones)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', 'EC 2.7.7.7 (DNA Polymerase I)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)']",IM,"['Acetylation', '*Centromere', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'Chromosomes, Fungal', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA Polymerase I/*metabolism', 'Gene Silencing', 'Histone Deacetylases/genetics', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Mutation', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*physiology', 'Schizosaccharomyces/enzymology/genetics/metabolism/*ultrastructure']",2008/05/22 09:00,2008/08/20 09:00,['2008/05/22 09:00'],"['2008/01/10 00:00 [received]', '2008/04/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/05/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/20 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/22 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1371/journal.pone.0002221 [doi]'],epublish,PLoS One. 2008 May 21;3(5):e2221. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0002221.,5,,,['WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom'],20080521,PMC2376062,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When considering an unsupervised machine learning routine, such as clustering, a bottom-up hierarchical (BU, agglomerative) algorithm is used as a default and is often the only method applied. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We show that hierarchical clustering that involve global considerations, such as top-down (TD, divisive), or glocal (global-local) algorithms are better suited to reveal meaningful patterns in the data. This is demonstrated, by testing the correspondence between the results of several algorithms (TD, glocal and BU) and the correct annotations provided by experts. The correspondence was tested in multiple domains including gene expression experiments, stock trade records and functional protein families. The performance of each of the algorithms is evaluated by statistical criteria that are assigned to clusters (nodes of the hierarchy tree) based on expert-labeled data. Whereas TD algorithms perform better on global patterns, BU algorithms perform well and are advantageous when finer granularity of the data is sought. In addition, a novel TD algorithm that is based on genuine density of the data points is presented and is shown to outperform other divisive and agglomerative methods. Application of the algorithm to more than 500 protein sequences belonging to ion-channels illustrates the potential of the method for inferring overlooked functional annotations. ClustTree, a graphical Matlab toolbox for applying various hierarchical clustering algorithms and testing their quality is made available. CONCLUSIONS: Although currently rarely used, global approaches, in particular, TD or glocal algorithms, should be considered in the exploratory process of clustering. In general, applying unsupervised clustering methods can leverage the quality of manually-created mapping of proteins families. As demonstrated, it can also provide insights in erroneous and missed annotations.","['Varshavsky, Roy', 'Horn, David', 'Linial, Michal']","['Varshavsky R', 'Horn D', 'Linial M']","['School of Computer Science and Engineering, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Jerusalem, Israel. roy.varshavsky@mail.huji.ac.il']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Ion Channels)']",IM,"['Algorithms', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/genetics', '*Cluster Analysis', '*Data Interpretation, Statistical', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Investments', 'Ion Channels/classification/physiology', 'Leukemia/genetics']",2008/05/22 09:00,2008/08/20 09:00,['2008/05/22 09:00'],"['2007/10/16 00:00 [received]', '2008/03/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/05/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/20 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/22 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1371/journal.pone.0002247 [doi]'],epublish,PLoS One. 2008 May 21;3(5):e2247. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0002247.,5,,,,20080521,PMC2375056,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We analyzed the outcome of 118 patients who received transplants for acute leukemia in 2 centers. Patients received highly T cell-depleted haploidentical grafts after myelo-ablative conditioning. Five-year event-free survival was better in patients who received transplants from the mother than from the father (50.6% +/- 7.6% vs 11.1% +/- 4.2%; P < .001). Better survival was the result of both reduced incidence of relapse and transplantation-related mortality. The protective effect was seen in both female and male recipients, in both lymphoid and myeloid diseases; it was more evident in patients receiving transplants in remission than in chemotherapy-resistant relapse. Incidences of rejection and acute graft-versus-host disease were not significantly influenced. Multivariate analysis confirmed donor sex in parental donor transplantation as an independent prognostic factor for survival (hazard ratio, father vs mother = 2.36; P = .003). In contrast, in a control cohort of patients who received transplants from haploidentical siblings, donor sex had no influence on outcome. Although obtained in a retrospective analysis, these data suggest that the mother of the patient should be preferred as donor for haploidentical HSCT.","['Stern, Martin', 'Ruggeri, Loredana', 'Mancusi, Antonella', 'Bernardo, Maria Ester', 'de Angelis, Claudia', 'Bucher, Christoph', 'Locatelli, Franco', 'Aversa, Franco', 'Velardi, Andrea']","['Stern M', 'Ruggeri L', 'Mancusi A', 'Bernardo ME', 'de Angelis C', 'Bucher C', 'Locatelli F', 'Aversa F', 'Velardi A']","['Department of Hematology, University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland. sternm@uhbs.ch']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Graft Rejection/epidemiology', 'Graft vs Host Disease/epidemiology', 'Haploidy', 'Humans', 'Italy/epidemiology', 'Killer Cells, Natural', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/mortality/prevention & control/therapy', '*Lymphocyte Depletion', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Minnesota/epidemiology', 'Mortality', '*Mothers', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Recurrence', '*Stem Cell Transplantation', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', '*Tissue Donors']",2008/05/22 09:00,2008/10/10 09:00,['2008/05/22 09:00'],"['2008/05/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/10 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)59827-3 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2008-01-135285 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2008 Oct 1;112(7):2990-5. doi: 10.1182/blood-2008-01-135285.

It has been suggested that LIF may play a role in human first trimester extravillous trophoblast (EVT) invasion. The aim of the present study was to establish whether LIF induces changes in EVT function related to invasiveness. METHODS: Primary first trimester human EVT cell cultures were treated with/without LIF and the effects on cell adhesion to fibronectin (FN), vitronectin (VN) and laminin (LN) were assessed. Transcript levels of integrin subunits that mediate cell adhesion to these extracellular matrix (ECM) elements were determined by real-time RT-PCR. Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)2 and MMP9 secretion was assessed by gelatine zymography and tissue inhibitors matrix metalloproteinase (TIMP) -1 and TIMP-2 secretion by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: EVT cells showed increased adhesion to FN, VN and LN ECM elements in response to LIF (20, 20 and 29%, respectively, P < 0.05 FN and VN compared to control; and P < 0.001 LN compared to control). Integrin beta(4) mRNA levels decreased by 50% following LIF treatment (P < 0.001 versus control). MMP2 and MMP9 secretion was not affected by LIF but LIF did increase secretion of TIMP-1 and -2 (P < 0.001 versus control). LIF stimulated the phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 3 protein while it did not affect STAT3 protein abundance. The addition of a LIF inhibitor attenuated the LIF-induced STAT3 phosphorylation in EVT. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that LIF can regulate EVT invasion, suggesting an important role in early placental development.","['Tapia, Alejandro', 'Salamonsen, Lois A', 'Manuelpillai, Ursula', 'Dimitriadis, Evdokia']","['Tapia A', 'Salamonsen LA', 'Manuelpillai U', 'Dimitriadis E']","[""Prince Henry's Institute of Medical Research, PO Box, 5152 Clayton, VIC 3168, Australia.""]",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Hum Reprod,"Human reproduction (Oxford, England)",8701199,"['0 (Fibronectins)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Laminin)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinase-1)', '0 (Vitronectin)', '127497-59-0 (Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinase-2)', 'EC 3.4.24.35 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 9)']",IM,"['Cell Adhesion/*drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Female', 'Fibronectins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Laminin/metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*physiology', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 9/metabolism', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Trimester, First', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinase-1/*metabolism', 'Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinase-2/*metabolism', 'Trophoblasts/*physiology', 'Vitronectin/metabolism']",2008/05/22 09:00,2008/09/30 09:00,['2008/05/22 09:00'],"['2008/05/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/30 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['den121 [pii]', '10.1093/humrep/den121 [doi]']",ppublish,Hum Reprod. 2008 Aug;23(8):1724-32. doi: 10.1093/humrep/den121.

Recent findings of over-activation of the TGF-beta signal in FKBP12-knockout mouse prompted us to investigate whether FK506, the canonical ligand of FKBP, can activate the TGF-beta signal in chronic lymphocytic leukemia. DESIGN AND METHODS: We studied 62 chronic lymphocytic leukemia samples from patients with Rai/Binet stage 0 to 4 disease. The TGF-beta signal was investigated by western blotting and flow cytometry. The levels of Bcl2-family members and death-associated-protein kinase were also investigated by western blotting, whereas apoptosis was studied in flow cytometry. Down-modulation of FKBP12 was obtained by gene silencing with short interfering RNA. RESULTS: Twenty-two out of 62 chronic lymphocytic leukemia samples were sensitive to TGF-beta-induced apoptosis. All but two of the responsive samples underwent apoptosis also when cultured with FK506, but not with cyclosporine. Thirteen samples that were not sensitive to TGF-beta were sensitive to FK506. Overall, response to FK506 occurred in 33 samples. FK506 induced Smad2 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation. Accordingly, death-associated-protein kinase, a transcriptional target of Smad, was induced. At the same time, Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL levels decreased whereas the levels of Bim and Bmf increased. A loss of mitochondrial membrane potential preceded caspase activation and cell death. FK506 removed FKBP12 from its binding to the TGF-beta-receptor. FKBP12 release activated the receptor-kinase activity as suggested by the enhanced levels of phospho-Smad found in cells depleted of FKBP12. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that most chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells escape the homeostatic control of TGF-beta and that FK506 restores the TGF-beta signal in a proportion of non-responsive samples. We demonstrated that FK506 activates TGF-beta receptor I kinase activity in chronic lymphocytic leukemia, which transduces apoptosis by a mitochondrial-dependent pathway.","['Romano, Simona', 'Mallardo, Maria', 'Chiurazzi, Federico', 'Bisogni, Rita', ""D'Angelillo, Anna"", 'Liuzzi, Raffaele', 'Compare, Giovanna', 'Romano, Maria Fiammetta']","['Romano S', 'Mallardo M', 'Chiurazzi F', 'Bisogni R', ""D'Angelillo A"", 'Liuzzi R', 'Compare G', 'Romano MF']","['Department of Biochemistry and Medical Biotechnologies, Federico II University, via Pansini, 5. 80131, Naples, Italy.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Smad Proteins)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', 'EC 5.2.1.- (Tacrolimus Binding Proteins)', 'WM0HAQ4WNM (Tacrolimus)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Disease Progression', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Ligands', 'Mitochondria/metabolism', 'Mutation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smad Proteins/metabolism', 'Tacrolimus/*pharmacology', 'Tacrolimus Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/*metabolism', 'bcl-X Protein/metabolism']",2008/05/22 09:00,2008/10/10 09:00,['2008/05/22 09:00'],"['2008/05/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/10 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.12402 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.12402 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2008 Jul;93(7):1039-48. doi: 10.3324/haematol.12402.

Acute leukemia with pulmonary infection was initially diagnosed, but subsequent examinations including open lung biopsy revealed leukemic pulmonary infiltrates without infection. In one case, the clinical condition and chest radiography improved initially after combination therapy with chemotherapy for leukemia and aggressive pulmonary support. However, new pulmonary infiltration on chest radiography and hypoxemia recurred, which was consistent with acute lysis pneumopathy. Despite aggressive treatment, both patients died due to rapidly deteriorating condition. Leukemic pulmonary involvement should be considered in acute leukemia patients with non-infectious diffusive lung infiltration, especially in acute leukemia with a high blast count.","['Wu, Yao-Kuang', 'Huang, Yi-Chih', 'Huang, Shiu-Feng', 'Huang, Chung-Chi', 'Tsai, Ying-Huang']","['Wu YK', 'Huang YC', 'Huang SF', 'Huang CC', 'Tsai YH']","['Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Buddhist Tzu Chi General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.']",,['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Singapore,J Formos Med Assoc,Journal of the Formosan Medical Association = Taiwan yi zhi,9214933,,IM,"['Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemic Infiltration/*complications', 'Lung/*pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Respiratory Distress Syndrome/*etiology']",2008/05/22 09:00,2008/09/13 09:00,['2008/05/22 09:00'],"['2008/05/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/13 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0929-6646(08)60108-4 [pii]', '10.1016/S0929-6646(08)60108-4 [doi]']",ppublish,J Formos Med Assoc. 2008 May;107(5):419-23. doi: 10.1016/S0929-6646(08)60108-4.,5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Richter transformation occurs in 3.3 to 10.6% of patients with CLL. The large cell lymphoma clone occurs by transformation of the original CLL clone in the majority of patients, and as a separate and independent neoplasm in fewer cases. Richter transformation may be triggered by viral infections, such as Epstein-Barr virus infection, which are common in immunosuppressed patients. Trisomy 12 and chromosome 11 abnormalities, as well as multiple genetic defects, have been described in patients with Richter syndrome. These abnormalities may cause CLL cells to proliferate and, by facilitating the acquisition of new genetic abnormalities, to transform into Richter syndrome cells. Presenting features typically include a rapid clinical deterioration with fever in the absence of infection, progressive lymph node enlargement, and an elevation in serum lactate dehydrogenase. Extranodal Richter syndrome has also been reported to occur in the central nervous system, eye, gastrointestinal system, nose, skin, face, bone and bronchus. The therapeutic options include cytoreductive therapy consisting of chemotherapy and immunotherapy, followed by allogeneic stem cell transplantation as postremission therapy.","['Omoti, Caroline Edijana', 'Omoti, Afekhide Ernest']","['Omoti CE', 'Omoti AE']","['Department of Haematology, University of Benin Teaching Hospital, Benin City, Nigeria. ediomoti@yahoo.com']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,IM,"['Central Nervous System Diseases/etiology', 'Eye Diseases/etiology', 'Gastrointestinal Diseases/etiology', '*Hodgkin Disease/diagnosis/etiology/therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/complications', '*Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/diagnosis/etiology/therapy', 'Syndrome']",2008/05/22 09:00,2008/12/17 09:00,['2008/05/22 09:00'],"['2008/05/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['BJH7248 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2008.07248.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2008 Sep;142(5):709-16. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2008.07248.x.

Strategies to improve immune responses induced by DC are currently being explored. We have recently shown the feasibility of generating fully functional DC from acute myeloid leukaemic (AML) blasts, but with varying expression levels of the important costimulatory molecule CD86. To overcome this variability, we developed a novel bispecific diabody that simultaneously and agonistically targeted CD40 on AML-DC and CD28 on naive T cells. Beside optimization of CD28-mediated signalling, the resulting cellular cross-linking was also hypothesized to increase the strength and duration of T cell/AML-DC interactions, thus increasing T-cell responsiveness to AML antigens. The alphaCD40/alphaCD28-bispecific diabody was found to bind to its target antigens and provoked increased T-cell-DC cluster formation. The alphaCD40/alphaCD28 diabody is capable of increasing T-cell proliferation induced by AML-DC as well as the induction of DC maturation. Importantly, priming efficacy of tumour-specific cytotoxic T cells can also be improved by cross-linking AML-DC and T cells with the alphaCD40/alphaCD28 diabody. We propose that the alphaCD40/alphaCD28-bispecific diabody can serve as a potent therapeutic tool to effectively augment anti-tumour T-cell responses elicited by AML-DC.","['Houtenbos, Ilse', 'Santegoets, Saskia', 'Westers, Theresia M', 'Waisfisz, Quinten', 'Kipriyanov, Sergey', 'Denkers, Fedor', 'Scheper, Rik J', 'de Gruijl, Tanja D', 'Ossenkoppele, Gert J', 'van de Loosdrecht, Arjan A']","['Houtenbos I', 'Santegoets S', 'Westers TM', 'Waisfisz Q', 'Kipriyanov S', 'Denkers F', 'Scheper RJ', 'de Gruijl TD', 'Ossenkoppele GJ', 'van de Loosdrecht AA']","['Department of Haematology, VU University Medical Centre, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antibodies, Bispecific)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (CD28 Antigens)', '0 (CD40 Antigens)', '0 (Cancer Vaccines)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Bispecific/biosynthesis/immunology/*therapeutic use', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*immunology', 'CD28 Antigens/*immunology', 'CD40 Antigens/*immunology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Cancer Vaccines/*immunology', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Dendritic Cells/cytology/immunology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/*methods', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*immunology/pathology/therapy', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology']",2008/05/22 09:00,2010/02/23 06:00,['2008/05/22 09:00'],"['2008/05/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/23 06:00 [medline]', '2008/05/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['BJH6990 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2008.06990.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2008 Jun;142(2):273-83. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2008.06990.x.

TGF-beta1 is also known to affect cell-to-cell interactions between tumour cells and stromal cells. We investigated the role of TGF-beta1 in the survival of myelo-monocytic leukaemia cell lines co-cultured with bone marrow (BM)-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSC). Treatment with recombinant human (rh)TGF-beta1 inhibited spontaneous and cytarabine-induced apoptosis in U937 cells, most prominently in U937 cells directly attached to MSCs. Conversely, the pro-survival effects of TGF-beta1 were inhibited by LY2109761 or TGF-beta1 neutralizing antibody. rhTGF-beta1 increased pro-survival phosphorylation of Akt, which was inhibited by LY2109761. The combination of rhTGF-beta1 and MSC co-culture induced significant upregulation of C/EBPbeta gene (CEBPB) and protein expression along with increased C/EBPbeta liver-enriched activating protein: liver-enriched inhibitory protein ratio, suggesting the novel role of C/EBPbeta in TGF-beta1-mediated U937 cell survival in the context of stromal cell support. In summary, these results indicate that TGF-beta1 produced by BM stromal cells promotes the survival and chemoresistance of leukaemia cells under the direct cell-to-cell interactions. The blockade of TGF-beta signalling by LY2109761, which effectively inhibited the pro-survival signalling, may enhance the efficacy of chemotherapy against myelo-monocytic leukaemic cells in the BM microenvironment.","['Xu, Yuanyuan', 'Tabe, Yoko', 'Jin, Linhua', 'Watt, Julie', 'McQueen, Teresa', 'Ohsaka, Akimichi', 'Andreeff, Michael', 'Konopleva, Marina']","['Xu Y', 'Tabe Y', 'Jin L', 'Watt J', 'McQueen T', 'Ohsaka A', 'Andreeff M', 'Konopleva M']","['Department of Clinical Pathology, Juntendo University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (LY2109761)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharide Receptors)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrroles)', '0 (Receptors, Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta1)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Lipopolysaccharide Receptors/metabolism', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Pyrazoles/*pharmacology', 'Pyrroles/*pharmacology', 'Receptors, Transforming Growth Factor beta/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Stromal Cells/metabolism', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta1/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'U937 Cells/metabolism']",2008/05/22 09:00,2010/02/23 06:00,['2008/05/22 09:00'],"['2008/05/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/23 06:00 [medline]', '2008/05/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['BJH7130 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2008.07130.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2008 Jun;142(2):192-201. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2008.07130.x.

Risk factors of CLL transformation differed from risk factors of CLL progression. These results suggest that CD38 and del13q14 may identify biological subsets of CLL with different RS predisposition.

The Polish Adult Leukemia Group ALL 4-2002 MRD Study.,227-37,10.1111/j.1365-2141.2008.07185.x [doi],"The treatment of adults with Philadelphia-negative acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) depends on the presence of risk factors including age, white blood cell count, immunophenotype and time to complete remission. In recent years, status of minimal residual disease (MRD) has been postulated as an additional risk criterion. This study prospectively evaluated the significance of MRD. Patients were treated with a uniform Polish Adult Leukemia Group (PALG) 4-2002 protocol. MRD status was assessed after induction and consolidation by multiparametric flow cytometry. Out of 132 patients included (age, 17-60 years), 116 patients were suitable for analysis. MRD level >/=0.1% of bone marrow cells after induction was found to be a strong and independent predictor for relapse in the whole study population (P < 0.0001), as well as in the standard risk (SR, P = 0.0003) and high-risk (P = 0.008) groups. The impact of MRD after consolidation on outcome was not significant. The combination of MRD status with conventional risk stratification system identified a subgroup of patients allocated to the SR group with MRD <0.1% after induction who had a very low risk of relapse of 9% at 3 years as opposed to 71% in the remaining subjects (P = 0.001). We conclude that MRD evaluation after induction should be considered with conventional risk criteria for treatment decisions in adult ALL.","['Holowiecki, Jerzy', 'Krawczyk-Kulis, Malgorzata', 'Giebel, Sebastian', 'Jagoda, Krystyna', 'Stella-Holowiecka, Beata', 'Piatkowska-Jakubas, Beata', 'Paluszewska, Monika', 'Seferynska, Ilona', 'Lewandowski, Krzysztof', 'Kielbinski, Marek', 'Czyz, Anna', 'Balana-Nowak, Agnieszka', 'Krol, Maria', 'Skotnicki, Aleksander B', 'Jedrzejczak, Wieslaw W', 'Warzocha, Krzysztof', 'Lange, Andrzej', 'Hellmann, Andrzej']","['Holowiecki J', 'Krawczyk-Kulis M', 'Giebel S', 'Jagoda K', 'Stella-Holowiecka B', 'Piatkowska-Jakubas B', 'Paluszewska M', 'Seferynska I', 'Lewandowski K', 'Kielbinski M', 'Czyz A', 'Balana-Nowak A', 'Krol M', 'Skotnicki AB', 'Jedrzejczak WW', 'Warzocha K', 'Lange A', 'Hellmann A']","['Department of Haematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Silesian Medical University, Katowice, Poland. holow@sum.edu.pl']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antigens, CD)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antigens, CD/*analysis', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Cells/immunology', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry/methods', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping/methods', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*diagnosis/immunology', 'Poland', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Recurrence', 'Risk', 'Young Adult']",2008/05/22 09:00,2010/02/23 06:00,['2008/05/22 09:00'],"['2008/05/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/23 06:00 [medline]', '2008/05/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['BJH7185 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2008.07185.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2008 Jun;142(2):227-37. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2008.07185.x.

Breakpoint cluster region (Bcr)-Abl signaling is reactivated at the time of resistance, predominantly due to mutations in the kinase domain of Bcr-Abl that interfere with drug binding. This discovery prompted the development of new Abl kinase inhibitors, among which nilotinib and dasatinib have gained regulatory approval. Despite excellent results in patients with imatinib-resistant or imatinib-intolerant CML treated with nilotinib or dasatinib, early indications suggest that: the cross-resistant Bcr-Abl(T315I) mutant is disproportionately represented among patients who relapse on these therapies; each Abl inhibitor exhibits vulnerabilities to certain kinase domain mutations. We review new inhibitors of Bcr-Abl, including preliminary information on inhibitors of Bcr-Abl(T315I) and discuss the potential of combined Abl kinase inhibitor therapy to preempt resistance. Improved Abl inhibitor therapies will be useful in achieving maximum disease control but a clinical T315I inhibitor remains a high priority.","[""O'Hare, Thomas"", 'Eide, Christopher A', 'Deininger, Michael W']","[""O'Hare T"", 'Eide CA', 'Deininger MW']","['Oregon Health & Science University Cancer Institute, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Portland, Oregon 97239, USA.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Expert Opin Investig Drugs,Expert opinion on investigational drugs,9434197,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Harringtonines)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '6FG8041S5B (Homoharringtonine)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Biological Availability', 'Clinical Trials as Topic/statistics & numerical data', 'Drug Design', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects/genetics', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Genes, abl', 'HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Harringtonines/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Homoharringtonine', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/enzymology/genetics', 'Mutation, Missense', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Piperazines/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Point Mutation', 'Protein Conformation/drug effects', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/enzymology']",2008/05/22 09:00,2008/09/19 09:00,['2008/05/22 09:00'],"['2008/05/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/19 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/22 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1517/13543784.17.6.865 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Investig Drugs. 2008 Jun;17(6):865-78. doi: 10.1517/13543784.17.6.865.,6,110,,['Howard Hughes Medical Institute/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Cancer mortality rates for Alaska Native (AN), U.S., White (USW) and other populations were calculated using SEERStat. Ratios of age-adjusted incidence rates with 95% confidence intervals are provided. RESULTS: Data were from SEERStat. Age-adjusted cancern mortality rates for Alaska Native exceeded those of USW population by 20%. For specific cancer sites, rates were significantly higher among AN people: oral cavity and pharynx (RR=1.9), esophagus (RR=2.0), stomach (RR=3.9), colon and rectum (RR=1.8), liver (RR=1.9), gallbladder (RR=2.6), pancreas (RR=1.3), lung and bronchus (RR=1.2), and kidney and renal pelvis (RR=2.2). In contrast, mortality rates among AN people were significantly lower than USW rates for cancers of the prostate (RR=0.7), brain and nervous system (RR=0.3), lymphoma (RR=0.6), and leukemia (RR=0.4). CONCLUSION: Marked disparities in cancer mortality exist among the Alaska Native population compared to the US White population. Excess mortality is documented for all sites combined and for many cancer specific sites. Rates for all cancers combined and for select sites are among the highest of any racial/ethnic group in the United States.","['Lanier, Anne P', 'Day, Gretchen Ehrsam', 'Kelly, Janet J', 'Provost, Ellen']","['Lanier AP', 'Day GE', 'Kelly JJ', 'Provost E']","['Office of Alaska Native Health Research, Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium, Anchorage, Alaska, USA.']",,['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Alaska Med,Alaska medicine,0370457,,IM,"['Alaska/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Indians, North American/*statistics & numerical data', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*ethnology/*mortality', 'Whites']",2008/05/22 09:00,2008/06/25 09:00,['2008/05/22 09:00'],"['2008/05/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/25 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/22 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Alaska Med. 2008 Jan-Mar;49(4):120-5.,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Four forms of OSMR have been identified: leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR), OSMR beta, short-form OSMR (OSMRs) and soluble OSMR (sOSMR). In this study, we examined the type and expression of OSMR in lung adenocarcinomas (LADCs). Expression of OSMR was determined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), immunoblotting, immunohistochemistry and confocal immunofluorescent microscopy (CIM). Our results showed that, among the four forms of OSMR, OSMRs was mainly expressed in LADC, and expression level of OSMRs correlated with patient survival. CIM revealed that OSMRs was localized on the cell membrane of LADC cell lines in vitro. OSMRs acts as a decoy receptor by reducing the inhibitory effect of OSM on cell growth. Decrease in OSMRs expression by siRNA increased cell sensitivity to OSM, and ectopic expression of OSMRs reduced cell sensitivity to OSM. These results suggest that expression of OSMRs, which operates as a decoy receptor for OSM, is correlated with disease progression and adverse prognosis in patients with LADC.","['Chen, Dr', 'Chu, C-Y', 'Chen, C-Y', 'Yang, H-C', 'Chiang, Y-Y', 'Lin, T-Y', 'Chiang, I-P', 'Chuang, D-Y', 'Yu, C-C', 'Chow, K-C']","['Chen D', 'Chu CY', 'Chen CY', 'Yang HC', 'Chiang YY', 'Lin TY', 'Chiang IP', 'Chuang DY', 'Yu CC', 'Chow KC']","['Department of Surgery, Chang-Hua Christian Hospital, Chang-Hua, Taiwan.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Pathol,The Journal of pathology,0204634,"['0 (Oncostatin M Receptor beta Subunit)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', '0 (Receptors, Oncostatin M)', '106956-32-5 (Oncostatin M)']",IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/*chemistry/mortality/pathology', 'Cell Membrane/chemistry/ultrastructure', 'Chi-Square Distribution', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Lung Neoplasms/*chemistry/mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Oncostatin M/analysis/genetics/metabolism', 'Oncostatin M Receptor beta Subunit/analysis/genetics/metabolism', 'Prognosis', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering/pharmacology', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF/analysis/genetics', 'Receptors, Oncostatin M/*analysis/genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Survival Rate']",2008/05/21 09:00,2008/08/14 09:00,['2008/05/21 09:00'],"['2008/05/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/14 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/21 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/path.2361 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pathol. 2008 Jul;215(3):290-9. doi: 10.1002/path.2361.,3,,,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2008 Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we investigated the role and regulation of death-associated protein-5 (DAP5/p97/NAT1), a novel inhibitor of translational initiation, in APL cell differentiation and apoptosis. We found that ATRA markedly induced DAP5/p97 protein and gene expression and nuclear translocation during terminal differentiation of APL (NB4) and HL60 cells but not differentiation-resistant cells (NB4.R1 and HL60R), which express very low levels of DAP5/p97. At the differentiation inducing concentrations, ATO (<0.5 microM), dimethyl sulfoxide, 1,25-dihydroxy-vitamin-D3, and phorbol-12-myristate 13-acetate also significantly induced DAP5/p97 expression in NB4 cells. However, ATO administered at apoptotic doses (1-2 microM) induced expression of DAP5/p86, a proapoptotic derivative of DAP5/p97. ATRA and ATO-induced expression of DAP5/p97 was associated with inhibition of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway. Furthermore, DAP5/p97 expression was upregulated by inhibition of the PI3K/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway via LY294002 and via rapamycin. Finally, knockdown of DAP5/p97 expression by small interfering RNA inhibited ATRA-induced granulocytic differentiation and ATO-induced apoptosis. Together, our data reveal new roles for DAP5/p97 in ATRA-induced differentiation and ATO-induced apoptosis in APL and suggest a novel regulatory mechanism by which PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway inhibition mediates ATRA- and ATO-induced expression of DAP5/p97.","['Ozpolat, Bulent', 'Akar, Ugur', 'Zorrilla-Calancha, Isabel', 'Vivas-Mejia, Pablo', 'Acevedo-Alvarez, Marian', 'Lopez-Berestein, Gabriel']","['Ozpolat B', 'Akar U', 'Zorrilla-Calancha I', 'Vivas-Mejia P', 'Acevedo-Alvarez M', 'Lopez-Berestein G']","['Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas M D Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Boulevard, Box 422, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",Netherlands,Apoptosis,Apoptosis : an international journal on programmed cell death,9712129,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (EIF4G2 protein, human)', '0 (Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-2)', '0 (Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-4G)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (PDCD4 protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects/physiology', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/metabolism', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/pharmacology', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-2/metabolism', 'Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-4G/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Granulocytes/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Models, Biological', 'Oxides/pharmacology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",2008/05/21 09:00,2008/08/21 09:00,['2008/05/21 09:00'],"['2008/05/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/21 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/21 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s10495-008-0222-9 [doi]'],ppublish,Apoptosis. 2008 Jul;13(7):915-28. doi: 10.1007/s10495-008-0222-9.,7,,,"['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U54 RFA CA096300/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In previous research, we found that MZ3 is a potent and specific compound against leukemia cell lines both in vitro and in vivo. In this paper, our purpose is to investigate the mechanisms of MZ3 induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in K562 cells. METHODS: Cytotoxicity was measured by MTT method; apoptosis and cell cycle arrest were measured by flow cytometry. DNA fragmentation was tested by agarose gel electrophoresis. Protein expression was analyzed by western blotting. The polymerization of microtubules in cell was detected through immunofluorescence. RESULTS: MZ3 increases cyclin B1 levels and decreases the expression of cdc2, cdc25C and activation of Wee1. The changes in cdc2, cdc25C and Wee1 coincide with the appearance of phosphoepitopes recognized by a marker of mitosis, MPM-2. MZ3 induces apoptosis in K562 cells, proved by condensed DNA (DAPI stain) and DNA ladder. This apoptosis is related with the activation of caspase-9, caspase-3 and PARP cleavage, both of which are at the downstream of mitochondria. The changes of protein expression of Bcl-2 and Bax confirm the causal relationship between MZ3 and mitochondrial pathway, and the downregulation of AKT, p-AKT and XIAP indicate that the AKT pathway may participate in regulating this apoptosis. Moreover, MZ3 can reduce the soluble tubulin in K562 cells and inhibit microtubule assembly. CONCLUSIONS: MZ3 is a promising antileukemia compound with antimitotic and apoptotic activity that has potential for management of various leukemias.","['Fang, Liang', 'Shen, Li', 'Fang, Yanfen', 'Hu, Yongzhou', 'He, Qiaojun', 'Yang, Bo']","['Fang L', 'Shen L', 'Fang Y', 'Hu Y', 'He Q', 'Yang B']","['Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhejiang University, #388 Yuhangtang Road, Hangzhou, Zhejiang 310058, China.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol,Journal of cancer research and clinical oncology,7902060,"['0', '(4-(4-bromophenyl)-2,3-dihydro-N,3-bis(3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)-2-oxoidmi-dazole-1', '-carboxamide)', '0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (COL11A2 protein, human)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Collagen Type XI)', '0 (Cyclin B)', '0 (FOXM1 protein, human)', '0 (Forkhead Box Protein M1)', '0 (Forkhead Transcription Factors)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Tubulin)', '0 (X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein)', '0 (XIAP protein, human)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (WEE1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDC2 Protein Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (CDC25C protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (cdc25 Phosphatases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'CDC2 Protein Kinase', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Caspase 9/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Division/*drug effects', 'Collagen Type XI/metabolism', 'Cyclin B/metabolism', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Forkhead Box Protein M1', 'Forkhead Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'G2 Phase/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/*pharmacology', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/metabolism/*pathology', 'Mitosis/drug effects', 'Molecular Structure', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Tubulin/metabolism', 'X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein/metabolism', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism', 'cdc25 Phosphatases/metabolism']",2008/05/21 09:00,2009/02/20 09:00,['2008/05/21 09:00'],"['2007/09/20 00:00 [received]', '2008/05/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/05/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/02/20 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/21 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00432-008-0416-0 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol. 2008 Dec;134(12):1337-45. doi: 10.1007/s00432-008-0416-0.

Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) can be used to detect subtle structural changes in brain morphology and via analysis of fractional anisotropy (FA), diffusion-tensor imaging (DTI) can non-invasively probe white matter (WM) integrity. We used VBM and DTI to examine 20 long-term survivors of ALL and 21 healthy matched controls. Ten ALL survivors received chemotherapy and irradiation; ten survivors received chemotherapy alone during childhood. Imaging was performed on a 3.0-T MRI. For VBM, group comparisons of segmented T1-weighted grey matter (GM) and WM images from controls and ALL survivors were performed separately for patients who received chemotherapy alone and who received chemotherapy and irradiation. For DTI, FA in WM was compared for the same groups. Survivors of childhood ALL who underwent cranial irradiation during childhood had smaller WM volumes and reduced GM concentration within the caudate nucleus and thalamus. The FA in WM was reduced in adult survivors of ALL but the effect was more severe after combined treatment with irradiation and chemotherapy. Our results indicate that DTI and VBM can reveal persistent long-term WM and caudate changes in children after ALL treatment, even without T2 changes in conventional imaging.","['Porto, L', 'Preibisch, C', 'Hattingen, E', 'Bartels, M', 'Lehrnbecher, T', 'Dewitz, R', 'Zanella, F', 'Good, C', 'Lanfermann, H', 'DuMesnil, R', 'Kieslich, M']","['Porto L', 'Preibisch C', 'Hattingen E', 'Bartels M', 'Lehrnbecher T', 'Dewitz R', 'Zanella F', 'Good C', 'Lanfermann H', 'DuMesnil R', 'Kieslich M']","['Department of Neuroradiology, Klinikum Goethe Universitat, Frankfurt, Germany. luciana.porto@kgu.de']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Eur Radiol,European radiology,9114774,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Brain/*pathology', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging/*methods', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Imaging, Three-Dimensional/*methods', 'Leukemia/*diagnosis', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Male', 'Survivors', 'Young Adult']",2008/05/21 09:00,2009/04/07 09:00,['2008/05/21 09:00'],"['2008/01/31 00:00 [received]', '2008/04/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/03/06 00:00 [revised]', '2008/05/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/07 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/21 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00330-008-1038-2 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur Radiol. 2008 Nov;18(11):2691-700. doi: 10.1007/s00330-008-1038-2.

Little is known regarding the effectiveness of DLI in children who relapse after HSCT. We report outcomes of 49 children who received DLI for relapse after allogeneic transplant. Prognosis was particularly poor (0/14 responses) for patients relapsing within 6 months from transplant. DLI rarely induced remission when given as sole therapy for marrow relapse. One-year disease-free survival was 30% (6/20) in patients who received DLI as consolidation following chemotherapy. The development of GVHD grades 1-2 was associated with superior 3-year survival than patients who developed GVHD grades 3-4 (P<0.002). To determine the benefit of DLI, 45 children who received DLI for relapse (four children without matches were excluded) were compared to 1229 children with similar characteristics whose relapse was not treated with DLI. There was no difference in survival (P=0.30) once adjustments were made to account for the time from relapse to DLI. Although a few children achieved durable remissions when DLI was used as part of a post-relapse treatment strategy, DLI was unsuccessful in the majority of cases. Strategies may be better directed at preempting post transplant relapse.","['Levine, J E', 'Barrett, A J', 'Zhang, M-J', 'Arora, M', 'Pulsipher, M A', 'Bunin, N', 'Fort, J', 'Loberiza, F', 'Porter, D', 'Giralt, S', 'Drobyski, W', 'Wang, D', 'Pavletic, S', 'Ringden, O', 'Horowitz, M M', 'Collins, R Jr']","['Levine JE', 'Barrett AJ', 'Zhang MJ', 'Arora M', 'Pulsipher MA', 'Bunin N', 'Fort J', 'Loberiza F', 'Porter D', 'Giralt S', 'Drobyski W', 'Wang D', 'Pavletic S', 'Ringden O', 'Horowitz MM', 'Collins R Jr']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109-5941, USA. jelevine@med.umich.edu']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Child', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/epidemiology', 'Graft vs Tumor Effect', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*surgery/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/surgery/therapy', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/surgery/therapy', '*Leukocyte Transfusion', 'Male', 'Recurrence', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Tissue Donors', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2008/05/21 09:00,2008/11/14 09:00,['2008/05/21 09:00'],"['2008/05/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/11/14 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['bmt2008135 [pii]', '10.1038/bmt.2008.135 [doi]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2008 Aug;42(3):201-5. doi: 10.1038/bmt.2008.135.

In murine hematopoiesis, Flt3 is not expressed in self-renewing hematopoietic stem cells, but its expression is restricted to the multipotent and the lymphoid progenitor stages at which cells are incapable of self-renewal. We extensively analyzed the expression of Flt3 in human (h) hematopoiesis. Strikingly, in both the bone marrow and the cord blood, the human hematopoietic stem cell population capable of long-term reconstitution in xenogeneic hosts uniformly expressed Flt3. Furthermore, human Flt3 is expressed not only in early lymphoid progenitors, but also in progenitors continuously along the granulocyte/macrophage pathway, including the common myeloid progenitor and the granulocyte/macrophage progenitor. We further found that human Flt3 signaling prevents stem and progenitors from spontaneous apoptotic cell death at least through up-regulating Mcl-1, an indispensable survival factor for hematopoiesis. Thus, the distribution of Flt3 expression is considerably different in human and mouse hematopoiesis, and human FLT3 signaling might play an important role in cell survival, especially at stem and progenitor cells that are critical cellular targets for acute myelogenous leukemia transformation.","['Kikushige, Yoshikane', 'Yoshimoto, Goichi', 'Miyamoto, Toshihiro', 'Iino, Tadafumi', 'Mori, Yasuo', 'Iwasaki, Hiromi', 'Niiro, Hiroaki', 'Takenaka, Katsuto', 'Nagafuji, Koji', 'Harada, Mine', 'Ishikawa, Fumihiko', 'Akashi, Koichi']","['Kikushige Y', 'Yoshimoto G', 'Miyamoto T', 'Iino T', 'Mori Y', 'Iwasaki H', 'Niiro H', 'Takenaka K', 'Nagafuji K', 'Harada M', 'Ishikawa F', 'Akashi K']","['Medicine and Biosystemic Science, Kyushu University Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Fukuoka, Japan.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Bone Marrow Cells/enzymology', 'Cell Survival', 'Fetal Blood/cytology', 'Granulocyte Precursor Cells/cytology/*enzymology', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/*enzymology', 'Humans', 'Lymphoid Progenitor Cells/cytology/enzymology', 'Macrophages/cytology', 'Mice', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Myeloid Progenitor Cells/cytology/enzymology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'Up-Regulation', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*metabolism']",2008/05/21 09:00,2008/07/19 09:00,['2008/05/21 09:00'],"['2008/05/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/19 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['180/11/7358 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.180.11.7358 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2008 Jun 1;180(11):7358-67. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.180.11.7358.,11,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVE: To compare cancer incidence among HIV-infected persons with incidence in the general population from 1992 to 2003. DESIGN: Prospective observational cohort studies. SETTING: United States. PATIENTS: 54,780 HIV-infected persons in the Adult and Adolescent Spectrum of HIV Disease Project (47,832 patients) and the HIV Outpatient Study (6948 patients), who contributed 157,819 person-years of follow-up from 1992 to 2003, and 334,802,121 records from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program of 13 geographically defined, population-based, central cancer registries. MEASUREMENTS: Standardized rate ratios (SRRs) to compare cancer incidence in the HIV-infected population with standardized cancer incidence in the general population. RESULTS: The incidence of the following types of non-AIDS-defining cancer was significantly higher in the HIV-infected population than in the general population: anal (SRR, 42.9 [95% CI, 34.1 to 53.3]), vaginal (21.0 [CI, 11.2 to 35.9]), Hodgkin lymphoma (14.7 [CI, 11.6 to 18.2]), liver (7.7 [CI, 5.7 to 10.1]), lung (3.3 [CI, 2.8 to 3.9]), melanoma (2.6 [CI, 1.9 to 3.6]), oropharyngeal (2.6 [CI, 1.9 to 3.4]), leukemia (2.5 [CI, 1.6 to 3.8]), colorectal (2.3 [CI, 1.8 to 2.9]), and renal (1.8 [CI, 1.1 to 2.7]). The incidence of prostate cancer was significantly lower among HIV-infected persons than the general population (SRR, 0.6 [CI, 0.4 to 0.8]).

To establish the safety and efficacy of induction chemotherapy with infusional fluorouracil (FU) plus cisplatin followed by FU plus mitomycin C with concurrent radiation in patients with poor-prognosis squamous cell cancers of the anal canal. METHODS: Patients with previously untreated anal canal cancers with T3 or T4 tumors and/or extensive nodal involvement (bulky N2 or N3) received two 28-day cycles of induction treatment with infusional FU plus cisplatin followed by two 28-day cycles of FU plus mitomycin C with concurrent split-course radiation. A third cycle of FU and cisplatin with radiation boost was given to patients with persistent primary site disease or bulky N2 or N3 disease at presentation. RESULTS: Forty-five assessable patients received protocol therapy. Treatment was generally well tolerated, and gastrointestinal and hematologic toxicities were the most common. Induction chemotherapy resulted in eight complete and 21 partial responses. After induction, combined-modality, and boost therapy, 37 (82%) of 45 assessable high-risk patients achieved a complete response. After 4 years of follow-up, 68% of patients are alive, 61% are disease-free, and 50% are colostomy- and disease-free. CONCLUSION: A combined-modality approach that includes induction treatment with FU and cisplatin followed by combined-modality therapy with FU, mitomycin C, and concurrent radiation results in long-term disease control in the majority of patients with poor-prognosis anal canal cancer.","['Meropol, Neal J', 'Niedzwiecki, Donna', 'Shank, Brenda', 'Colacchio, Thomas A', 'Ellerton, John', 'Valone, Frank', 'Budinger, Susan', 'Day, Jeannette M', 'Hopkins, Judy', 'Tepper, Joel', 'Goldberg, Richard M', 'Mayer, Robert J']","['Meropol NJ', 'Niedzwiecki D', 'Shank B', 'Colacchio TA', 'Ellerton J', 'Valone F', 'Budinger S', 'Day JM', 'Hopkins J', 'Tepper J', 'Goldberg RM', 'Mayer RJ']","['Fox Chase Cancer Center, 333 Cottman Ave, Philadelphia, PA 19111, USA. neal.meropol@fccc.edu']",,['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['50SG953SK6 (Mitomycin)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Anus Neoplasms/*drug therapy/radiotherapy', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/*drug therapy/radiotherapy', 'Chemotherapy, Adjuvant', 'Cisplatin/administration & dosage', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Fluorouracil/administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitomycin/administration & dosage', 'Neoadjuvant Therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome']",2008/05/21 09:00,2008/08/15 09:00,['2008/05/21 09:00'],"['2008/05/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/15 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['JCO.2008.16.2339 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2008.16.2339 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2008 Jul 1;26(19):3229-34. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2008.16.2339.

At diagnosis, acquisition of segmental uniparental disomy (UPD) by mitotic recombination has been reported in 15% to 20% of AML cases, associated with homozygous mutations in the region of loss of heterozygosity. This study aimed to discover if clonal evolution from heterozygous to homozygous mutations by mitotic recombination provides a mechanism for relapse. DNA from 27 paired diagnostic and relapsed AML samples were analyzed using genotyping arrays. Newly acquired segmental UPDs were observed at relapse in 11 AML samples (40%). Six were segmental UPDs of chromosome 13q, which were shown to lead to a change from heterozygosity to homozygosity for internal tandem duplication mutation of FLT3 (FLT3 ITD). Three further AML samples had evidence of acquired segmental UPD of 13q in a subclone of the relapsed leukemia. One patient acquired segmental UPD of 19q that led to homozygosity for a CEBPA mutation 207C>T. Finally, a single patient with AML acquired segmental UPD of chromosome 4q, for which the candidate gene is unknown. We conclude that acquisition of segmental UPD and the resulting homozygous mutation is a common event associated with relapse of AML.","['Raghavan, Manoj', 'Smith, Lan-Lan', 'Lillington, Debra M', 'Chaplin, Tracy', 'Kakkas, Ioannis', 'Molloy, Gael', 'Chelala, Claude', 'Cazier, Jean-Baptiste', 'Cavenagh, James D', 'Fitzgibbon, Jude', 'Lister, T Andrew', 'Young, Bryan D']","['Raghavan M', 'Smith LL', 'Lillington DM', 'Chaplin T', 'Kakkas I', 'Molloy G', 'Chelala C', 'Cazier JB', 'Cavenagh JD', 'Fitzgibbon J', 'Lister TA', 'Young BD']","['Medical Oncology Unit, Centre for Molecular Oncology, Institute of Cancer, Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry, London, UK. manoj.raghavan@cancer.org.uk']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 13', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 19', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 4', 'Clone Cells', 'Female', 'Genotype', 'Homozygote', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', '*Recombination, Genetic', 'Recurrence', '*Uniparental Disomy', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics']",2008/05/21 09:00,2008/09/06 09:00,['2008/05/21 09:00'],"['2008/05/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/06 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)60427-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2008-01-132431 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2008 Aug 1;112(3):814-21. doi: 10.1182/blood-2008-01-132431.

Although E. chaffeensis induces the generation of several cytokines and chemokines by leukocytes, E. chaffeensis lacks lipopolysaccharide and peptidoglycan. Bioinfomatic analysis of the E. chaffeensis genome, however, predicted genes encoding 15 lipoproteins and 3 posttranslational lipoprotein-processing enzymes. The present study showed that by use of multidimensional liquid chromatography followed by tandem mass spectrometry, all predicted lipoproteins as well as lipoprotein-processing enzymes were expressed by E. chaffeensis cultured in the human promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL-60. Consistent with this observation, a signal peptidase II inhibitor, globomycin, was found to inhibit E. chaffeensis infection and lipoprotein processing in HL-60 cell culture. To study in vivo E. chaffeensis lipoprotein expression and host immune responses to E. chaffeensis lipoproteins, 13 E. chaffeensis lipoprotein genes were cloned into a mammalian expression vector. When the DNA constructs were inoculated into naive dogs, or when dogs were infected with E. chaffeensis, the animals developed delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions at cutaneous sites of the DNA construct deposition and serum antibodies to these lipoproteins. This is the first demonstration of lipoprotein expression and elicitation of immune responses by a member of the order Rickettsiales. Multiple lipoproteins expressed by E. chaffeensis in vitro and in vivo may play key roles in pathogenesis and immune responses in HME.","['Huang, Haibin', 'Lin, Mingqun', 'Wang, Xueqi', 'Kikuchi, Takane', 'Mottaz, Heather', 'Norbeck, Angela', 'Rikihisa, Yasuko']","['Huang H', 'Lin M', 'Wang X', 'Kikuchi T', 'Mottaz H', 'Norbeck A', 'Rikihisa Y']","['Department of Veterinary Biosciences, The Ohio State University, 1925 Coffey Rd., Columbus, OH 43210, USA.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Infect Immun,Infection and immunity,0246127,"['0 (Antibodies, Bacterial)', '0 (Bacterial Proteins)', '0 (Lipoproteins)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Bacterial/blood', 'Bacterial Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/*immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Dog Diseases/microbiology', 'Dogs', 'Ehrlichia chaffeensis/genetics/*immunology', 'Ehrlichiosis/immunology/veterinary', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hypersensitivity, Delayed', 'Lipoproteins/biosynthesis/genetics/*immunology', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Proteomics', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry']",2008/05/21 09:00,2008/08/08 09:00,['2008/05/21 09:00'],"['2008/05/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/08 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['IAI.00056-08 [pii]', '10.1128/IAI.00056-08 [doi]']",ppublish,Infect Immun. 2008 Aug;76(8):3405-14. doi: 10.1128/IAI.00056-08.

Most current research on human tumors is focused on molecular and cellular analysis of the bulk tumor mass. However, evidence in leukemia and, more recently, in solid tumors suggests that the tumor cell population is heterogeneous. In recent years, several groups have described the existence of a cancer stem cell population in different brain tumors. These neural cancer stem cells (NCSC) can be isolated by cell sorting of dissociated suspensions of tumor cells for the neural stem cell marker CD133. These CD133+ cells -which also express nestin, an intermediate filament that is another neural stem cell marker- represent a small fraction of the entire brain tumor population. The stem-like cancer cells appear to be solely responsible for propagating the disease in laboratory models. A promising new approach to treating glioblastoma proposes targeting cancer stem cells. Here, we summarize progress in delineating NCSC and the implications of the discovery of this cell population in human brain tumors.","['Perez Castillo, A', 'Aguilar-Morante, D', 'Morales-Garcia, J A', 'Dorado, J']","['Perez Castillo A', 'Aguilar-Morante D', 'Morales-Garcia JA', 'Dorado J']","['Instituto de Investigaciones Biomedicas, CSIC-UAM and Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red sobre Enfermedades Neurodegenerativas, Madrid, Spain. aperez@iib.uam.es']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Italy,Clin Transl Oncol,Clinical & translational oncology : official publication of the Federation of Spanish Oncology Societies and of the National Cancer Institute of Mexico,101247119,"['0 (AC133 Antigen)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (PROM1 protein, human)', '0 (Peptides)']",IM,"['AC133 Antigen', 'Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Brain Neoplasms/metabolism/*pathology', 'Glioblastoma/metabolism/*pathology', 'Glycoproteins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*pathology/*physiology', 'Peptides/metabolism']",2008/05/21 09:00,2008/11/19 09:00,['2008/05/21 09:00'],"['2008/05/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/11/19 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['1159 [pii]', '10.1007/s12094-008-0195-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Transl Oncol. 2008 May;10(5):262-7. doi: 10.1007/s12094-008-0195-8.,5,56,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) were evaluated before and after allogeneic BMT every 3 months in 32 patients who survived for at least 100 days. General case histories were also examined. RESULTS: Univariate analysis revealed that decreased post-BMT DLCO was associated with increased overall and event-free survival (p < 0.05). While a pre-BMT FEV1 of < 70% was associated with significantly decreased overall survival (p < 0.05), multiple regression analysis indicated that patients without cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, having limited chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and with markedly decreased DLCO had better overall survival (p < 0.05). After adjusting for age, gender, chronic GVHD, and CMV infection, patients with decreased DLCO exhibited enhanced overall survival. Two-year survival and event-free survival rates were significantly higher in patients with decreased DLCO.

Pegylated filgrastim (pegfilgrastim) has a substantially increased elimination half-life due to decreased serum clearance. A single-dose of pegfilgrastim is equivalent in enhancing neutrophil recovery after chemotherapy compared to daily filgrastim administrations. Several clinical trials also investigated chemotherapy plus single-dose pegfilgrastim in the mobilization of autologous PBSC in patients with lymphoma or myeloma. The results indicated similar efficacy compared to unconjugated G-CSF in terms of blood CD34+ cell count, stem cell yields as well as engraftment of after reinfusion. However, the number of patients in these trials were limited and there were non-randomized controls only. Furthermore, the mobilization of 12 mg pegfilgrastim was not superior over the 6 mg dose, and in one trial insufficient results were observed in heavily pretreated patients. In allogeneic stem cell donors a single-dose of 12 mg pegfilgrastim has been shown to induce a sufficient increase of blood CD34+ cells with a similar kinetics as known from conventional G-CSF. Adequate numbers of PBSC for transplantation could be harvested mostly by a single apheresis. Bone pain and headaches appeared to be more severe and about 90% of donors required analgetics. Additional concerns are due to spleen enlargement and hyperleukocytosis.

We evaluated the feasibility of reduced-intensity transplantation using fludarabine and busulfan, with particular focus on the clinical impact of antithymocyte globulin (ATG) in the conditioning regimen. Fourteen elderly patients with aggressive ATLL were enrolled in the current study without ATG, and were compared to those in 15 patients who were treated similarly, but with ATG, in our previous study. Engraftment was prompt, and treatment was tolerable. Overall (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) at 3 years were 36% and 31%, respectively. HTVL-1 proviral load became undetectable by the polymerase chain reaction in 62% of patients. Compared to the previous study with ATG, complete donor chimera was significantly delayed. Although early relapse tended to be decreased, OS or PFS was not improved significantly. Analysis of combined data from both our current and previous studies disclosed that grade I-II acute GVHD was the only factor that favorably affected OS and PFS.

Because persistence or increase of recipient-derived hematopoietic or malignant cells has pathogenic import under these conditions, analysis of recipient-derived cells should be useful to understand the pathogenesis of graft failure and relapse of primary disease. Because most CBT involves human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-mismatched transplantation, we developed a 9-color fluorescence activated cell sorter (FACS)-based method of mixed chimerism (MC) analysis using anti-HLA antibodies to detect mismatched antigens (HLA-Flow method). Among CD4(+) T cells, CD8(+) T cells, B cells, NK cells, monocytes, and granulocytes, donor- and recipient-derived cells alike could be individually analyzed simultaneously in a rapid, quantitative and highly sensitive manner, making the HLA-Flow method very valuable in monitoring the engraftment process. In addition, this method was also useful in monitoring recipient-derived cells with leukemia-specific phenotypes, both as minimal residual disease (MRD) and as early harbingers of relapse. Leukemia relapse can be definitively diagnosed by cytogenetic or PCR studies using recipient-derived cells sorted for leukemia markers. Multicolor HLA-fFlow analysis and cell sorting in early diagnosis of graft failure and relapse was confirmed as valuable in 14 patients who had received HLA-mismatched CBT.","['Watanabe, Nobukazu', 'Takahashi, Satoshi', 'Ishige, Masayuki', 'Ishii, Yumiko', 'Ooi, Jun', 'Tomonari, Akira', 'Tsukada, Nobuhiro', 'Konuma, Takaaki', 'Kato, Seiko', 'Sato, Aki', 'Tojo, Arinobu', 'Nakauchi, Hiromitsu']","['Watanabe N', 'Takahashi S', 'Ishige M', 'Ishii Y', 'Ooi J', 'Tomonari A', 'Tsukada N', 'Konuma T', 'Kato S', 'Sato A', 'Tojo A', 'Nakauchi H']","['FACS Core Laboratory, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan. nwatanab@ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (HLA Antigens)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis', 'Blood Cell Count/instrumentation/methods', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cell Separation/instrumentation/*methods', '*Cord Blood Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Flow Cytometry/instrumentation/*methods', 'Graft Rejection/*blood', 'Graft Survival', 'HLA Antigens/analysis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Histocompatibility', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*blood/diagnosis/pathology/surgery', 'Lymphocyte Subsets/cytology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Monocytes/cytology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Phenotype', 'Recurrence']",2008/05/21 09:00,2008/08/20 09:00,['2008/05/21 09:00'],"['2008/02/20 00:00 [received]', '2008/04/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/05/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/20 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1083-8791(08)00145-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbmt.2008.04.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2008 Jun;14(6):693-701. doi: 10.1016/j.bbmt.2008.04.001.,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most patients with isolated central nervous system (CNS) relapse have good outcomes when treated with intrathecal and systemic chemotherapy followed by irradiation to the neuroaxis. However, the role of HCT remains unclear for those patients with early isolated CNS relapse (<18 months) or who had high risk disease at diagnosis. We therefore compared the HCT outcomes of 116 children treated at the University of Minnesota from 1991 to 2006 with relapsed ALL involving the CNS alone (CNS, n = 14), the bone marrow alone (BM, n = 85), or both bone marrow and CNS (BM + CNS, n = 17). There were no significant differences among groups in age at diagnosis or transplant, length of first complete remission (CR1), remission status (CR2 versus >or=CR3), graft source, or preparative regimen. The incidence of acute GVHD was similar between groups. Patients with isolated CNS relapse had the lowest cumulative incidence of mortality following transplant (CNS: 0%, BM: 19%, BM + CNS: 29%, P = .03) and relapse (CNS: 0% BM: 30%, BM + CNS: 12%, at 2 years, P = .01) and highest leukemia-free survival (CNS: 91%, BM: 35%, BM + CNS: 46%, P < .01) at 5 years. Risk factors for poor survival were: T cell leukemia or BCR-ABL gene rearrangement, history of marrow relapse, and receipt of HLA-mismatched marrow. These data support the use of allogeneic HCT in the treatment of children with poor prognosis isolated CNS relapse.","['Harker-Murray, Paul D', 'Thomas, Avis J', 'Wagner, John E', 'Weisdorf, Daniel', 'Luo, Xianghua', 'DeFor, Todd E', 'Verneris, Michael R', 'Dusenbery, Kathryn E', 'MacMillan, Margaret L', 'Tolar, Jakub', 'Baker, K Scott', 'Orchard, Paul J']","['Harker-Murray PD', 'Thomas AJ', 'Wagner JE', 'Weisdorf D', 'Luo X', 'DeFor TE', 'Verneris MR', 'Dusenbery KE', 'MacMillan ML', 'Tolar J', 'Baker KS', 'Orchard PJ']","['Pediatric Blood and Marrow Transplant Program, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA.']",,['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Factors', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/statistics & numerical data', 'Central Nervous System/*pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cord Blood Stem Cell Transplantation/statistics & numerical data', 'Cranial Irradiation', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemic Infiltration/radiotherapy/*surgery', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/pathology/radiotherapy/*surgery', 'Prognosis', 'Radiotherapy, Adjuvant', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",2008/05/21 09:00,2008/08/20 09:00,['2008/05/21 09:00'],"['2007/10/04 00:00 [received]', '2008/03/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/05/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/20 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1083-8791(08)00119-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbmt.2008.03.011 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2008 Jun;14(6):685-92. doi: 10.1016/j.bbmt.2008.03.011.,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The groups had comparable pretreatment characteristics, except that Bu-Flu patients were older (46 versus 39 years, P < .01), more often had unrelated donors (47.3% versus 20.9%, P < .0003), and had shorter median follow-up (39.7 versus 74.6 months). To account for improved supportive care and other unidentified factors that may affect outcome (""period"" effects), 78 acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) patients receiving Melphalan-Flu (MF), treated in parallel during this time (1997-2004) were used to estimate the period effect. The MF patients' outcomes worsened during this period. Therefore, the period effect is unlikely to explain the greatly improved outcome with Bu-Flu.

Donor lymphocyte infusion and graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) are generally ineffective in such ALLs, whereas GVL is highly active against bcr/abl(+) CML, which does not have a lesion in the INK4A/ARF locus. The mechanisms for the ineffectiveness of GVL are not fully known, and it is possible that intrinsic resistance of acute lymphoid leukemias to immune effectors associated with allogeneic GVL may contribute to ineffectiveness. This work tested the hypothesis that INK4A/ARF mutations that are associated with transformation of bcr/abl(+) CML to an ALL phenotype, and that are associated with increased resistance to apoptosis render ALL cells insensitive to allogeneic immune responses to minor histocompatibility antigens (mHA). Murine acute pre-B ALLs were induced by transfer of the human p210 bcr/abl gene into bone marrow of INK4A/ARF null mice. These ALL lines were then studied in a murine model of MHC-matched, mHA-mismatched allogeneic BMT. In vivo growth of these ALLs was inhibited in allogeneic transplants characterized by active allogeneic immune responses compared to their behavior in syngeneic transplants. In vitro ALLs with INK4A/ARF, p210 bcr/abl, or p190 bcr/abl mutations remained sensitive to anti-mHA cytolytic T cells. In addition, the ALLs were capable of inducing primary immune responses to mHAs in vivo. Thus, ALLs with INK4A/ARF or bcr/abl mutations are not intrinsically resistant to allogeneic T cell responses, suggesting that active immunotherapies against mHA have the potential to control such acute lymphoblastic leukemias.","['Young, Faith M', 'Campbell, Andrew', 'Emo, Kris Lambert', 'Jansson, Johan', 'Wang, Pin-Yi', 'Jordan, Craig T', 'Mullen, Craig A']","['Young FM', 'Campbell A', 'Emo KL', 'Jansson J', 'Wang PY', 'Jordan CT', 'Mullen CA']","['Department of Medicine, University of Rochester, Rochester, New York, USA.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,"['0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (Minor Histocompatibility Antigens)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/immunology', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cells, Cultured/immunology', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16/deficiency/*genetics', 'Disease Progression', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Genes, abl', 'Genes, p16', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Minor Histocompatibility Antigens/*immunology', 'Models, Immunological', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*immunology/pathology/surgery', 'Radiation Chimera', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/*immunology/transplantation', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology/transplantation', 'Transplantation, Homologous/immunology']",2008/05/21 09:00,2008/08/20 09:00,['2008/05/21 09:00'],"['2007/11/14 00:00 [received]', '2008/02/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/05/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/20 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1083-8791(08)00091-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbmt.2008.02.015 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2008 Jun;14(6):622-30. doi: 10.1016/j.bbmt.2008.02.015.

This study aimed at estimating life expectancy (LE) after the diagnosis of cancer and the expected years of life lost (EYLL) using a newly developed semiparametric method. METHODS: Patients (n = 425,294) diagnosed with 17 different types of major cancer were enrolled. All of the patients were registered with the Taiwan Cancer Registry between 1990 and 2001; their survivals were followed through the end of 2004. The survival function for an age- and sex-matched reference population was generated using the Monte Carlo method from the life table of the general population. Lifetime survival of the cancer patients (up to 50 years) were obtained using linear extrapolation of a logit-transformed curve of the survival ratio between the cancer and reference populations. The estimates were compared with the results from the extrapolation of fitted Weibull models. RESULTS: The 15-year survival, LE, and EYLL for 17 different types of cancer were determined, of which the LE of breast, cervical, ovarian, and skin cancers exceeded 15 years; nasopharyneal, leukemia, bladder, kidney, and colorectal cancers exceeded 10 years. Validity tests indicated that the relative biases of the extrapolated estimates were usually <5% under high censoring rates. CONCLUSIONS: The newly developed method is feasible and relatively accurate to project LE and EYLL, which could also be merged with data pertaining to quality of life, for a more detailed outcome assessment in the future.","['Chu, Po-Ching', 'Wang, Jung-Der', 'Hwang, Jing-Shiang', 'Chang, Yu-Yin']","['Chu PC', 'Wang JD', 'Hwang JS', 'Chang YY']","['Institute of Occupational Medicine and Industrial Hygiene, College of Public Health, National Taiwan University, Taiwan.']",,['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Value Health,Value in health : the journal of the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research,100883818,,IM,"['Aged', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', '*Life Expectancy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Monte Carlo Method', 'Neoplasms/*mortality', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Survivors', 'Taiwan/epidemiology']",2008/05/21 09:00,2009/07/30 09:00,['2008/05/21 09:00'],"['2008/05/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/30 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1098-3015(10)60592-X [pii]', '10.1111/j.1524-4733.2008.00350.x [doi]']",ppublish,Value Health. 2008 Dec;11(7):1102-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1524-4733.2008.00350.x.

Unfortunately, its use has also been associated with agranulocytosis. Here, we have investigated the metabolism of PA by myeloperoxidase (MPO) and the formation of an MPO protein free radical. We hypothesized that PA oxidation by MPO/H 2O 2 would produce a PA cation radical that, in the absence of a biochemical reductant, would lead to the free radical oxidation of MPO. We utilized a novel anti-DMPO antibody to detect DMPO (5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide) covalently bound to protein, which forms by the reaction of DMPO with a protein free radical. We found that PA metabolism by MPO/H 2O 2 induced the formation of DMPO-MPO, which was inhibited by MPO inhibitors and ascorbate. N-acetyl-PA did not cause DMPO-MPO formation, indicating that the unsubstituted aromatic amine was more oxidizable. PA had a lower calculated ionization potential than N-acetyl-PA. The DMPO adducts of MPO metabolism, as analyzed by electron spin resonance spectroscopy, included a nitrogen-centered radical and a phenyl radical derived from PA, either of which may be involved in the free radical formation on MPO. Furthermore, we also found protein-DMPO adducts in MPO-containing, intact human promyelocytic leukemia cells (HL-60). MPO was affinity-purified from HL-60 cells treated with PA/H 2O 2 and was found to contain DMPO using the anti-DMPO antibody. Mass spectrometry analysis confirmed the identity of the protein as human MPO. These findings were also supported by the detection of protein free radicals with electron spin resonance in the cellular cytosolic lysate. The formation of an MPO protein free radical is believed to be mediated by free radical metabolites of PA, which we characterized by spin trapping. We propose that drug-induced free radical formation on MPO may play a role in the origin of agranulocytosis.","['Siraki, Arno G', 'Deterding, Leesa J', 'Bonini, Marcelo G', 'Jiang, Jinjie', 'Ehrenshaft, Marilyn', 'Tomer, Kenneth B', 'Mason, Ronald P']","['Siraki AG', 'Deterding LJ', 'Bonini MG', 'Jiang J', 'Ehrenshaft M', 'Tomer KB', 'Mason RP']","['Laboratory of Pharmacology and Chemistry, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, National Institutes of Health, 111 Alexander Dr., Research Triangle Park, NC 27709, USA. sirakia@niehs.nih.gov']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",United States,Chem Res Toxicol,Chemical research in toxicology,8807448,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Free Radicals)', '0 (Ions)', '910Q707V6F (Acecainide)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'EC 1.11.1.7 (Peroxidase)', 'L39WTC366D (Procainamide)', 'PQ6CK8PD0R (Ascorbic Acid)']",IM,"['Acecainide/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Ascorbic Acid/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Electron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Free Radicals/*metabolism', 'Granulocytes/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/pharmacology', 'Ions/chemistry', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Molecular Structure', 'Peroxidase/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Procainamide/chemistry/metabolism/*pharmacology']",2008/05/21 09:00,2008/07/23 09:00,['2008/05/21 09:00'],"['2008/05/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/23 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/21 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/tx700415b [doi]'],ppublish,Chem Res Toxicol. 2008 May;21(5):1143-53. doi: 10.1021/tx700415b.

Using chromatin immunoprecipitation microarrays (ChIP-chip) in prostate cancer cells compared to normal prostate, we found that up to 5% of promoters (16% CpG islands and 84% non-CpG islands) were enriched with H3K27triM. These genes were silenced specifically in prostate cancer, and those CpG islands affected showed low levels of DNA methylation. Downregulation of the EZH2 histone methyltransferase restored expression of the H3K27triM target genes alone or in synergy with histone deacetylase inhibition, without affecting promoter DNA methylation, and with no effect on the expression of genes silenced by DNA hypermethylation.

These cells may be refractory to various known growth-promoting signals, making it imperative to identify the biochemical signals necessary to coax them into mitosis. Using serum-starved cell lines as an experimental model of quiescent leukemic cells (QLCs), we demonstrate that a suppression of p38 stress kinase by pharmacological means forms a sufficient trigger to induce proliferative responses in the treated QLCs, even in the absence of any external growth-promoting stimulus. A robust expression of Ki67 and B23 was seen in treated cells, an effect clearly mediated through the activation of extra-cellular signal-regulated kinase (MEK/ERK) pathway. Commensurate with their proliferative status, the treated QLCs got sensitized to significantly low concentrations of anti-mitotic agents. Most importantly, primitive leukemic progenitors present in the mononuclear cells (MNCs) that were isolated from the peripheral blood of freshly diagnosed untreated acute myeloid leukemic (AML) patients got more efficiently killed by cytosine arabinoside (AraC), when the cells were pre-treated with a pharmacological inhibitor of p38. Our data strongly suggest that a suppression of p38 leads to the sensitization of QLCs to anti-mitotic drugs by triggering proliferative responses in them. This approach may have a potential clinical application.","['Vaidya, Anuradha A', 'Sharma, Monika B', 'Kale, Vaijayanti P']","['Vaidya AA', 'Sharma MB', 'Kale VP']","['National Center for Cell Science, NCCS Complex, University of Pune Campus, Ganeshkhind, Pune, India.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Biol Ther,Cancer biology & therapy,101137842,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Culture Media, Serum-Free)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Ki-67 Antigen)', '0 (heavy chain, monoclonal antibody B23)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/metabolism', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Culture Media, Serum-Free', 'Cytarabine/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/metabolism', 'Ki-67 Antigen/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Stress, Physiological', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism']",2008/05/20 09:00,2009/01/01 09:00,['2008/05/20 09:00'],"['2008/05/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/01 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['6262 [pii]', '10.4161/cbt.7.8.6262 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Biol Ther. 2008 Aug;7(8):1232-40. doi: 10.4161/cbt.7.8.6262.

Here we report that mice lacking Lsh develop leukemia associated with DNA hypomethylation and oncogene activation. Lsh is a member of the SNF2 chromatin remodeling family and is required for de novo methylation of genomic DNA. Mice that received Lsh deficient hematopoietic progenitors showed severe impairment of hematopoiesis, suggesting that Lsh is necessary for normal hematopoiesis. A subset of mice developed erythroleukemia, a tumor that does not spontaneously occur in mice. Tumor tissues were CpG hypomethylated and showed a modest elevation of the transcription factor PU.1, an oncogene that is crucial for Friend virus induced erythroleukemia. Analysis of Lsh(-/-) hematopoietic progenitors revealed widespread DNA hypomethylation at repetitive sequences and hypomethylation at specific retroviral elements within the PU.1 gene. Wild type cells showed Lsh and Dnmt3b binding at the retroviral elements located within the PU.1 gene. On the other hand, Lsh deficient cells had no detectable Dnmt3b association suggesting that Lsh is necessary for recruitment of Dnmt3b to its target. Furthermore, Lsh(-/-) hematopoietic precursors showed impaired suppression of retroviral elements in the PU.1 gene, an increase of PU.1 transcripts and protein levels. Thus DNA hypomethylation caused by Lsh depletion is linked to transcriptional upregulation of retroviral elements and oncogenes such as PU.1 which in turn may promote the development of erythroleukemia in mice.","['Fan, Tao', 'Schmidtmann, Anja', 'Xi, Sichuan', 'Briones, Victorino', 'Zhu, Heming', 'Suh, Hyung Chan', 'Gooya, John', 'Keller, Jonathan R', 'Xu, Hong', 'Roayaei, Jean', 'Anver, Miriam', 'Ruscetti, Sandra', 'Muegge, Kathrin']","['Fan T', 'Schmidtmann A', 'Xi S', 'Briones V', 'Zhu H', 'Suh HC', 'Gooya J', 'Keller JR', 'Xu H', 'Roayaei J', 'Anver M', 'Ruscetti S', 'Muegge K']","['Laboratory of Cancer Prevention, SAIC-FCRDC, Basic Research Program, National Cancer Institute, Frederick, Maryland, USA.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",United States,Epigenetics,Epigenetics,101265293,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (proto-oncogene protein Spi-1)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA methyltransferase 3B)', 'EC 3.6.4.- (DNA Helicases)', 'EC 5.99.- (lymphoid specific helicase, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases/metabolism', 'DNA Helicases/*deficiency/genetics', '*DNA Methylation', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Hematopoiesis/genetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*genetics/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Protein Binding', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'Retroviridae', 'Trans-Activators/genetics']",2008/05/20 09:00,2008/10/03 09:00,['2008/05/20 09:00'],"['2008/05/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/03 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['6252 [pii]', '10.4161/epi.3.3.6252 [doi]']",ppublish,Epigenetics. 2008 May-Jun;3(3):134-42. doi: 10.4161/epi.3.3.6252.

The objective of present experiment was to describe expression of genes encoding proteins known to be involved in pathways regulating mammary cell proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation, cell survival, and tissue remodeling. Mammary gland biopsies were taken 7 times during the pregnancy-lactation cycle of 10 dairy cows, and samples were analyzed by immunohistochemistry and real-time PCR. Cell proliferation was greatest during the dry period and apoptosis was high in early dry period and early lactation. Based on Fas (tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 6), Fas ligand, and caspase-3, caspase-8, and caspase-9 gene expression, no indication was found of a stage-dependent shift between the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways leading to apoptosis. Gene expression of microsomal glutathione S-transferase (mGST) did not vary significantly, whereas B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) and BCL2-associated X protein (Bax) gene expression was greatest during the dry period and early lactation and coincided with high cell turnover. Gene expression of early response genes c-Fos, c-Jun, and c-Myc correlated to neither rate of cell proliferation nor plasma concentration of insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I and insulin. Gene expression of nuclear factor of kappa light chain gene enhancer in B-cells (NFkappaB) and NFkappaB inhibitor alpha was greatest in the periparturient period, and NFkappaB gene expression coincided with an anticipated need for cell survival factors. Expression of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) receptor 1 and 2 mRNA was greatest in early lactation, whereas TGF-beta1 did not vary significant during the pregnancy-lactation cycle. Even though our results on the TGF-beta system did not comply with other studies, the gene expression pattern of the TGF-beta receptors indicates a role in regulating apoptosis in early lactation. Signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) gene expression was high in the periparturient period, which suggests a role for STAT5 in regulation of mammary cell proliferation and differentiation in dairy cows. Expression of tissue-plasminogen activator, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, and IGF binding protein 5 genes was greatest in early lactation, suggesting a role for IGF binding protein 5 in coordinating regulation of apoptosis and tissue remodeling.","['Norgaard, J V', 'Theil, P K', 'Sorensen, M T', 'Sejrsen, K']","['Norgaard JV', 'Theil PK', 'Sorensen MT', 'Sejrsen K']","['Department of Animal Health, Welfare and Nutrition, University of Aarhus, PO Box 50, DK-8830, Tjele, Denmark.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Dairy Sci,Journal of dairy science,2985126R,"['0 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Protein 5)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Caspases/genetics/metabolism', 'Cattle/metabolism/*physiology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival', 'Female', '*Gene Expression', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Protein 5/*physiology', 'Lactation/metabolism/*physiology', '*Mammary Glands, Animal/cytology/enzymology/physiology', 'Postpartum Period', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy, Animal/metabolism/*physiology', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/*physiology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Time Factors']",2008/05/20 09:00,2008/07/29 09:00,['2008/05/20 09:00'],"['2008/05/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/29 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0022-0302(08)71182-2 [pii]', '10.3168/jds.2007-0767 [doi]']",ppublish,J Dairy Sci. 2008 Jun;91(6):2319-27. doi: 10.3168/jds.2007-0767.,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although it is assumed that pain represents an adverse prognostic factor, this variable has not been extensively evaluated. The objective of this study was to determine whether men with CRPC who had higher pain interference scores at baseline had worse clinical outcomes compared with men who had lower pain scores. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data from three randomized phase III multicenter trials conducted by the Cancer and Leukemia Group B from 1992 to 1998 were combined. Eligible patients had progressive CRPC adenocarcinoma of the prostate, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 to 2, and adequate hematologic, renal, and hepatic functions. Seven items from the Brief Pain Inventory were used to assess the impact of pain on a range of daily activities and quality of life, each rated on a scale from 0 to 10. RESULTS: In 599 men, the median pain interference scores was 17 (interquartile range, 4 to 34), and 38% of the men had opioid analgesic use at baseline. There was a statistically significant association between pain interference scores and risk of death. The median survival times were 17.6 months (95% CI, 16.1 to 19.1 months) and 10.2 months (95% CI, 8.6 to 11.3 months; P < .001) in men with low (< 17) and high (>or= 17) pain scores, respectively. Pain was inversely associated with likelihood of prostate-specific antigen decline, objective response, and time to bone progression. CONCLUSION: This analysis demonstrates that pain is a statistically significant predictor of overall survival in men with metastatic CRPC. These results need to be validated prospectively in future phase III trials.","['Halabi, Susan', 'Vogelzang, Nicholas J', 'Kornblith, Alice B', 'Ou, San-San', 'Kantoff, Philip W', 'Dawson, Nancy A', 'Small, Eric J']","['Halabi S', 'Vogelzang NJ', 'Kornblith AB', 'Ou SS', 'Kantoff PW', 'Dawson NA', 'Small EJ']","['Department of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics, Duke University, and Cancer and Leukemia Group B Statistical Center, Durham, NC, USA. susan.halabi@duke.edu']",,['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/*mortality/secondary/surgery', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Bone Neoplasms/*mortality/secondary/surgery', 'Clinical Trials, Phase III as Topic', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Multicenter Studies as Topic', 'Neoplasms, Hormone-Dependent/*mortality/secondary/therapy', '*Orchiectomy', '*Pain Measurement', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/*mortality/pathology/surgery', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Statistics as Topic']",2008/05/20 09:00,2008/06/18 09:00,['2008/05/20 09:00'],"['2008/05/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/18 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['26/15/2544 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2007.15.0367 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2008 May 20;26(15):2544-9. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2007.15.0367.,15,,,"['P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 36601/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,['J Clin Oncol. 2008 Sep 1;26(25):4215-6; author reply 4216-7.

To investigate the association between clinicobiologic features and responsiveness of CLL cells to anti-IgM stimulation, we evaluated gene expression changes and modifications in cell-cycle distribution, proliferation, and apoptosis of IgV(H) mutated (M) and unmutated (UM) samples upon BCR cross-linking. Unsupervised analysis highlighted a different response profile to BCR stimulation between UM and M samples. Supervised analysis identified several genes modulated exclusively in the UM cases upon BCR cross-linking. Functional gene groups, including signal transduction, transcription, cell-cycle regulation, and cytoskeleton organization, were up-regulated upon stimulation in UM cases. Cell-cycle and proliferation analyses confirmed that IgM cross-linking induced a significant progression into the G(1) phase and a moderate increase of proliferative activity exclusively in UM patients. Moreover, we observed only a small reduction in the percentage of subG(0/1) cells, without changes in apoptosis, in UM cases; contrariwise, a significant increase of apoptotic levels was observed in stimulated cells from M cases.

We have mapped the global gene targets of SALL4 using chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by microarray hybridization and identified more than 2000 high-confidence, SALL4-binding genes in the human acute promyelocytic leukemic cell line, NB4. Analysis of SALL4-binding sites reveals that genes involved in cell death, cancer, DNA replication/repair, and cell cycle were highly enriched (P < .05). These genes include 38 important apoptosis-inducing genes (TNF, TP53, PTEN, CARD9, CARD11, CYCS, LTA) and apoptosis-inhibiting genes (Bmi-1, BCL2, XIAP, DAD1, TEGT). Real-time polymerase chain reaction has shown that expression levels of these genes changed significantly after SALL4 knockdown, which ubiquitously led to cell apoptosis. Flow cytometry revealed that reduction of SALL4 expression in NB4 and other leukemia cell lines dramatically increased caspase-3, annexin V, and DNA fragmentation activity. Bromodeoxyuridine-incorporation assays showed decreased numbers of S-phase cells and increased numbers of G1- and G2-phase cells indicating reduced DNA synthesis, consistent with results from cell proliferation assays. In addition, NB4 cells that express low levels of SALL4 have significantly decreased tumorigenecity in immunodeficient mice. Our studies provide a foundation in the development of leukemia stem cell-specific therapy by targeting SALL4.","['Yang, Jianchang', 'Chai, Li', 'Gao, Chong', 'Fowles, Taylor C', 'Alipio, Zaida', 'Dang, Hien', 'Xu, Dan', 'Fink, Louis M', 'Ward, David C', 'Ma, Yupo']","['Yang J', 'Chai L', 'Gao C', 'Fowles TC', 'Alipio Z', 'Dang H', 'Xu D', 'Fink LM', 'Ward DC', 'Ma Y']","['Division of Laboratory Medicine, Nevada Cancer Institute, Las Vegas, Nevada 89135, USA.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (SALL4 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*genetics', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/genetics', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/genetics/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism/*physiology', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2008/05/20 09:00,2008/09/06 09:00,['2008/05/20 09:00'],"['2008/05/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/06 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)60426-8 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2007-11-126326 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2008 Aug 1;112(3):805-13. doi: 10.1182/blood-2007-11-126326.

We report a detailed clinical and molecular characterization of 3 patients with chronic thrombocytopenia caused by distinct constitutional microdeletions involving chromosomal region 21q22.12. The patients exhibited growth restriction, dysmorphic features, and developmental delays. One patient developed acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) at 6 years of age. All 3 deletions included the RUNX1, CLIC6, DSCR, and KCNE1 genes. Our data provide additional support for the role of RUNX1 haploinsufficiency in megakaryopoiesis and predisposition to AML. The leukemic clone had trisomy 21 resulting from duplication of chromosome 21 containing the RUNX1 deletion. This shows that genes other than RUNX1 must also play a role in AML associated with trisomy 21. We recommend that children with syndromic thrombocytopenia have clinical array-comparative genomic hybridization analysis and appropriate cytogenetic studies to facilitate our ability to provide a definitive diagnosis.","['Shinawi, Marwan', 'Erez, Ayelet', 'Shardy, Deborah L', 'Lee, Brendan', 'Naeem, Rizwan', 'Weissenberger, George', 'Chinault, A Craig', 'Cheung, Sau Wai', 'Plon, Sharon E']","['Shinawi M', 'Erez A', 'Shardy DL', 'Lee B', 'Naeem R', 'Weissenberger G', 'Chinault AC', 'Cheung SW', 'Plon SE']","['Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Child', '*Chromosome Deletion', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21', 'Clone Cells', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/genetics', 'Erythropoiesis', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Megakaryocytes', 'Syndrome', 'Thrombocytopenia/*genetics']",2008/05/20 09:00,2008/09/17 09:00,['2008/05/20 09:00'],"['2008/05/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)49689-2 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2008-01-135970 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2008 Aug 15;112(4):1042-7. doi: 10.1182/blood-2008-01-135970.

(-)-Syringaresinol decreased the viability of HL-60 cells by inducing G(1) arrest followed by apoptosis in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The G(0)/G(1) phase of the cell cycle is regulated by cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdk), cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (Cdki). We show by western blot analysis, that the (-)-syringaresinol-induced G(1) arrest was mediated through the increased expression of Cdki proteins (p21(cip1/waf1) and p27(kip1)) with a simultaneous decrease in cdk2, cdk4, cdk6, cyclin D(1), cyclin D(2), and cyclin E expression. The induction of apoptosis after treatment with (-)-syringaresinol for 24 h was demonstrated by morphological changes, DNA fragmentation, altered ratio of Bax/Bcl-2, cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase and flow cytometry analysis. (-)-Syringaresinol also induced cytochrome c release and activation of caspase-3 and caspase-9. To our knowledge, this is the first time that (-)-syringaresinol has been reported to potently inhibit the proliferation of human promyelocytic HL-60 cells through G(1) arrest and induction of apoptosis. These findings suggest that (-)-syringaresinol may be a potential chemotherapeutic agent for the treatment of cancer.","['Park, Bo-Young', 'Oh, Sei-Ryang', 'Ahn, Kyung-Seop', 'Kwon, Ok-Kyong', 'Lee, Hyeong-Kyu']","['Park BY', 'Oh SR', 'Ahn KS', 'Kwon OK', 'Lee HK']","['Natural Medicines Research Center, KRIBB, 111 Gwahangno, Yuseong-gu, Daejeon 305-806, South Korea.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Int Immunopharmacol,International immunopharmacology,100965259,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Furans)', '0 (Lignans)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '21453-69-0 (syringaresinol)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'Furans/*pharmacology', 'G1 Phase/*drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Lignans/*pharmacology', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/analysis']",2008/05/20 09:00,2008/08/08 09:00,['2008/05/20 09:00'],"['2007/10/15 00:00 [received]', '2008/02/20 00:00 [revised]', '2008/02/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/05/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/08 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1567-5769(08)00077-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.intimp.2008.02.012 [doi]']",ppublish,Int Immunopharmacol. 2008 Jul;8(7):967-73. doi: 10.1016/j.intimp.2008.02.012.

Although involvement of in vitro fertilization in the tumor pathogenesis was not established, the likely effect of assisted reproductive technology has been increasingly considered in these tumors in the last decade. Congenital mesoblastic nephroma is the most common renal tumor of infancy younger than 6 months associated with an overall good prognosis. The cellular variant of congenital mesoblastic nephroma, which occurs primarily in infants older than 3 months, confers a less favorable prognosis. We present a case of an atypical congenital mesoblastic nephroma with cellular elements in a 2-month-old infant who was born after in vitro fertilization. To our knowledge, this is the second congenital mesoblastic nephroma case and the first one with cellular variant reported to date in the English literature after a pregnancy induced by an assisted reproductive technology.","['Yigiter, Murat', 'Arda, Irfan Serdar', 'Kiyici, Halil', 'Hicsonmez, Akgun']","['Yigiter M', 'Arda IS', 'Kiyici H', 'Hicsonmez A']","['Department of Pediatric Surgery, Faculty of Medicine, Baskent University, 06490 Bahcelievler, Ankara, Turkey.']",,['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Pediatr Surg,Journal of pediatric surgery,0052631,,IM,"['Female', 'Fertilization in Vitro/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Kidney Neoplasms/diagnostic imaging/drug therapy/etiology/*pathology/surgery', '*Mitosis', 'Nephroma, Mesoblastic/diagnostic imaging/drug therapy/etiology/*pathology/surgery', 'Ultrasonography']",2008/05/20 09:00,2008/08/30 09:00,['2008/05/20 09:00'],"['2007/10/09 00:00 [received]', '2008/01/03 00:00 [revised]', '2008/01/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/05/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/30 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0022-3468(08)00016-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.jpedsurg.2008.01.008 [doi]']",ppublish,J Pediatr Surg. 2008 May;43(5):E27-9. doi: 10.1016/j.jpedsurg.2008.01.008.,5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although arsenic compounds have been studied intensively, their interactions with living cells are still not fully elucidated. We have previously proposed that modulation of intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) homeostasis induced by As2O3 could be an important mechanism to induce cytotoxicity. Here we demonstrate, using human cell models (neuroblastoma (SY-5Y) or embryonic kidney cells (HEK)) and confocal microscopy in combination with the calcium sensitive dye fluo 4-AM, that As2O3 interferes with calcium signaling at low (environmentally and clinically relevant concentrations of 100 pM to 1 microM). Within this concentration range, As2O3 had cell type specific cytotoxic effects, with neuroblastoma cells being more sensitive to As2O3 than HEK 293. In addition, by staining with Hoechst 33347 and counting micronucleated cells as well as apoptotic nuclei, As2O3 was found to increase the rate of apoptosis and DNA damage, which was also cell type specific. These results indicate that the As2O3-induced cell death could be triggered or mediated by [Ca2+]i signals and suggest that low concentrations of As2O3 are able to interfere with specific physiological processes in diverse cell models.","['Florea, Ana-Maria', 'Busselberg, Dietrich']","['Florea AM', 'Busselberg D']","['Institut fur Physiologie, Universitatsklinikum, Universitat Duisburg Essen, Essen, Germany. anamflorea@gmail.com']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Toxicol Lett,Toxicology letters,7709027,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', 'I2ZWO3LS3M (Trypan Blue)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*toxicity', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Calcium Signaling/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'DNA Damage', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Homeostasis', 'Humans', 'Kidney/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Micronuclei, Chromosome-Defective/chemically induced', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Neuroblastoma/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Oxides/*toxicity', 'Trypan Blue']",2008/05/20 09:00,2008/08/06 09:00,['2008/05/20 09:00'],"['2008/02/04 00:00 [received]', '2008/03/22 00:00 [revised]', '2008/03/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/05/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/06 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0378-4274(08)00100-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.toxlet.2008.03.019 [doi]']",ppublish,Toxicol Lett. 2008 Jun 10;179(1):34-42. doi: 10.1016/j.toxlet.2008.03.019.

Mutations were detected by PCR-SSCP of all coding exons of the three isoforms of FBXW7, shifted bands were direct sequenced. As expected, mutations were found in T-cell acute lymphocytic leukemias. However mutations of FBXW7 were also found in four of 118 B-cell acute lymphocytic leukemias and one of 24 adult T-cell leukemia samples. The nucleotide changes consisted of an insertion, resulting in a frameshift mutation, and missense mutations of highly conserved residues. All mutations affected the FBXW7 target interacting domain.

This condition should be distinguished from inherited disorders with Mendelian transmission and single haematopoietic lineage proliferation, named hereditary erythrocytosis and thrombocytosis. The recently discovered mutations in patients with CMD (V617F and exon 12 of JAK2 gene, MPL gene), and those identified in hereditary erythrocytosis and in hereditary thrombocytosis have improved our ability to discriminate these conditions. In familial CMD, the JAK2 mutations are acquired and occur as secondary genetic events. As both mutations of the JAK2 gene have been reported in the same pedigree, a genetic predisposition to the acquisition of the JAK2 mutations is supposed to be inherited. The prevalence of familial cases within CMD is at least 7.6%. The inheritance pattern of familial CMD is consistent with an autosomal dominant trait with decreased penetrance. The clinical presentation at diagnosis of patients with familial CMD does not differ from that of patients with sporadic CMD. In addition, patients with familial CMD develop the same type of complications (thrombosis and haemorrhage) and disease evolution (post-PV myelofibrosis, post-ET myelofibrosis and leukaemia) observed in patients with sporadic CMD. The 10-year survival is 83% for patients with familial PV, 100% for those with familial ET, and 30% for those with familial PMF. The aim of this review is to focus the state of the art of familial CMD and to offer an overview of inherited conditions causing erythrocytosis and thrombocytosis.","['Rumi, Elisa']",['Rumi E'],"['Department of Hematology, University of Pavia Medical School, Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo, Pavia, Italy. elisarumi@hotmail.com']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Hematol Oncol,Hematological oncology,8307268,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Chronic Disease', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2/genetics', 'Mutation', 'Polycythemia/genetics', 'Polycythemia Vera/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Thrombocythemia, Essential/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Thrombocytosis/genetics']",2008/05/20 09:00,2008/11/05 09:00,['2008/05/20 09:00'],"['2008/05/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/11/05 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/20 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/hon.863 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematol Oncol. 2008 Sep;26(3):131-8. doi: 10.1002/hon.863.,3,105,,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

To the authors' knowledge, no recently published study has evaluated the management and clinical course in this regard, especially in relation to pediatric patients. METHODS: The authors reviewed 579 patients with newly diagnosed pediatric AML who were treated at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital from 1968 to 2002 and carefully examined 106 patients with initial leukocyte counts > or = 100 x 10(9)/L and French-American-British (FAB) AML subtypes other than M3. These patients with hyperleukocytosis were divided into 2 groups-'before' (early period; 70 patients) and 'after' (late period; 36 patients) the initiation of the AML-83 protocol-to address potential differences in supportive measures (including leukoreduction). RESULTS: Forty-five patients (42.5%) had early complications that were associated strongly with M4 and M5 FAB subtypes and had higher initial leukocyte counts than the patients without complications. Early deaths were less common in the late period (2.8%) than in the early period (22.9%; P = .01), although the incidence of early complications was similar. The late period was associated with a shorter time for referral (P = .0018), a longer time from admission to chemotherapy initiation (P < .0001), and lower white blood cell counts at chemotherapy initiation (P < .0001). In the late period, patients with or without hyperleukocytosis had similar complete remission rates. However, those with hyperleukocytosis had a lower postremission 10-year event-free survival rate (21.2% vs 41.7%; P = .0228). CONCLUSIONS: With improved management, including supportive care, early mortality in patients with AML and hyperleukocytosis decreased remarkably in the more recent period. However, better postremission treatment is required to improve long-term survival.","['Inaba, Hiroto', 'Fan, Ying', 'Pounds, Stanley', 'Geiger, Terrence L', 'Rubnitz, Jeffrey E', 'Ribeiro, Raul C', 'Pui, Ching-Hon', 'Razzouk, Bassem I']","['Inaba H', 'Fan Y', 'Pounds S', 'Geiger TL', 'Rubnitz JE', 'Ribeiro RC', 'Pui CH', 'Razzouk BI']","[""Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee 38105-2794, USA. hiroto.inaba@stjude.org""]",,['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications/*diagnosis/mortality/*therapy', 'Leukocytosis/complications/*diagnosis/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Neoadjuvant Therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",2008/05/20 09:00,2008/09/11 09:00,['2008/05/20 09:00'],"['2008/05/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/11 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/20 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.23581 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2008 Aug 1;113(3):522-9. doi: 10.1002/cncr.23581.,3,,,['CA21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,['(c) 2008 American Cancer Society'],,,,,,,,,,,,

We here analyzed 10 chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) samples using four different high-resolution platforms: BAC arrays (32K), oligonucleotide arrays (185K, Agilent), and two SNP arrays (250K, Affymetrix and 317K, Illumina). Cross-platform comparison revealed 29 concordantly detected CNAs, including known recurrent alterations, which confirmed that all platforms are powerful tools when screening for large aberrations. However, detection of 32 additional regions present in 2-3 platforms illustrated a discrepancy in detection of small CNAs, which often involved reported copy-number variations. LOH analysis using dChip revealed concordance of mainly large regions, but showed numerous, small nonoverlapping regions and LOH escaping detection. Evaluation of baseline variation and copy-number ratio response showed the best performance for the Agilent platform and confirmed the robustness of BAC arrays. Accordingly, these platforms demonstrated a higher degree of platform-specific CNAs. The SNP arrays displayed higher technical variation, although this was compensated by high density of elements. Affymetrix detected a higher degree of CNAs compared to Illumina, while the latter showed a lower noise level and higher detection rate in the LOH analysis. Large-scale studies of genomic aberrations are now feasible, but new tools for LOH analysis are requested.","['Gunnarsson, Rebeqa', 'Staaf, Johan', 'Jansson, Mattias', 'Ottesen, Anne Marie', 'Goransson, Hanna', 'Liljedahl, Ulrika', 'Ralfkiaer, Ulrik', 'Mansouri, Mahmoud', 'Buhl, Anne Mette', 'Smedby, Karin Ekstrom', 'Hjalgrim, Henrik', 'Syvanen, Ann-Christine', 'Borg, Ake', 'Isaksson, Anders', 'Jurlander, Jesper', 'Juliusson, Gunnar', 'Rosenquist, Richard']","['Gunnarsson R', 'Staaf J', 'Jansson M', 'Ottesen AM', 'Goransson H', 'Liljedahl U', 'Ralfkiaer U', 'Mansouri M', 'Buhl AM', 'Smedby KE', 'Hjalgrim H', 'Syvanen AC', 'Borg A', 'Isaksson A', 'Jurlander J', 'Juliusson G', 'Rosenquist R']","['Lund Strategic Research Center for Stem Cell Biology and Cell Therapy, Hematology and Transplantation, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.']",,['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,,IM,"['Chromosomes, Artificial, Bacterial', '*Gene Dosage', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics', '*Loss of Heterozygosity', 'Microchip Analytical Procedures/*methods/*standards', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide']",2008/05/20 09:00,2008/08/08 09:00,['2008/05/20 09:00'],"['2008/05/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/08 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/20 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/gcc.20575 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2008 Aug;47(8):697-711. doi: 10.1002/gcc.20575.,8,,,,,,,"['(c) 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients aged 2-16 years with hematological malignancies who had febrile neutropenia were randomly assigned to receive piperacillin/tazobactam (80 mg/kg piperacillin/10 mg/kg tazobactam, q6h) combined with amikacin (PTA) (7.5 mg/kg, q12h) or meropenem or imipenem (20 mg/kg, q8h) (C). Response to antimicrobial therapy, evaluated for etiological agents, was measured. Duration of fever, neutropenia, and hospitalization, mortality, and the need for additional antibiotics or antifungal drugs were compared for the treatment success between the two groups. Out of 87 febrile neutropenic episodes that were evaluable for comparison, 46 patients received PTA and 41 patients were treated with carbapenems (imipenem or meropenem). Overall, the microbiologically documented infection rate was 21.9%, with Staphylococcus epidermidis as the most common cause of bacteremia. The rate of treatment modification was 56.5% in the PTA group and 53.6% in the carbapenem group with no statistical difference (p > .05).

Loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsim) is an early initiating event in the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. We investigated the apoptotic response of 3 head and neck cancer cell lines treated with a mitochondrial-membrane-depolarizing agent, valinomycin, and studied the ability of depolarization to induce release of cytochrome c in these cell lines. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: HNSCC cell lines JHU-011, -012 and -019, and a leukemia control cell line HL-60 were assayed for DeltaPsim after valinomycin treatment by staining with mitochondrial-membrane-potential-specific probe JC-1 and stained with apoptosis-specific probe annexin-V to measure their rate of apoptosis by FACS. Western blotting was also applied to detect cytoplasmic cytochrome c release. RESULTS: DeltaPsim in head and neck cell lines started to show slight loss of DeltaPsim, while HL-60 showed significant loss of DeltaPsim after 30 min of treatment. All cell lines demonstrated complete mitochondrial depolarization within 24 h, however, only the control cell line HL-60 underwent apoptosis. In addition, HNSCC cell lines did not demonstrate cytoplasmic cytochrome c release despite significant mitochondrial membrane depolarization, while HL-60 cell initiated apoptosis and cytochcrome c release after 24 h of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Head and neck cancer cell lines exhibit defects in mitochondrial-membrane-depolarization-induced apoptosis as well as impaired release of cytochrome c despite significant mitochondrial membrane depolarization. Proximal defects in the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway are a feature of HNSCC.","['Zhao, Ming', 'Mydlarz, Wojciech K', 'Zhou, Shaoyu', 'Califano, Joseph']","['Zhao M', 'Mydlarz WK', 'Zhou S', 'Califano J']","['Department of Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery, Johns Hopkins Medical Institution, Baltimore, MD 21287-0910, USA.']",,['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Switzerland,ORL J Otorhinolaryngol Relat Spec,ORL; journal for oto-rhino-laryngology and its related specialties,0334721,['9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)'],IM,"['Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/metabolism/*pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytochromes c/biosynthesis', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Head and Neck Neoplasms/metabolism/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/*physiology', 'Mitochondria/*metabolism/pathology']",2008/05/17 09:00,2008/08/30 09:00,['2008/05/17 09:00'],"['2007/03/29 00:00 [received]', '2007/07/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/05/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/30 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['000133280 [pii]', '10.1159/000133280 [doi]']",ppublish,ORL J Otorhinolaryngol Relat Spec. 2008;70(4):257-63. doi: 10.1159/000133280.

Three transcription factors, Nanog, Oct4, and Sox2, have been reported to form a feedforward circuit promoting pluripotent cell self-renewal in embryonic stem cells (ESC). Previously, we found that a transcriptional repressor activity of Tcf3, a DNA-binding effector of Wnt signaling, reduced Nanog promoter activity and Nanog levels in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESC). The objective of this study was to determine the scope of Tcf3 effects on gene expression and self-renewal beyond the regulation of Nanog levels. We show that Tcf3 acts broadly on a genome-wide scale to reduce the levels of several promoters of self-renewal (Nanog, Tcl1, Tbx3, Esrrb) while not affecting other ESC genes (Oct4, Sox2, Fgf4). Comparing effects of Tcf3 ablation with Oct4 or Nanog knockdown revealed that Tcf3 counteracted effects of both Nanog and Oct4. Interestingly, the effects of Tcf3 were more strongly correlated with Oct4 than with Nanog, despite the normal levels of Oct4 in TCF3-/- mESC. The deranged gene expression allowed TCF3-/- mESC self-renewal even in the absence of leukemia inhibitory factor and delayed differentiation in embryoid bodies. These findings identify Tcf3 as a cell-intrinsic inhibitor of pluripotent cell self-renewal that functions by limiting steady-state levels of self-renewal factors.

The angiopoietin/Tie ligand-receptor system is an essential regulator of this process. We evaluated whether circulating angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2) is a predictor for the probability of disease-free survival (DFS) in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) for high-risk acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome. Ang-2 was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in serum from 20 healthy controls and 90 patients with acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome before conditioning for HSCT. Circulating Ang-2 was elevated in patients (median, 2.21 ng/mL; range, 0.18-48.84 ng/mL) compared with controls (median, 0.87 ng/mL; range, 0.27-4.51 ng/mL; P < .001). Multivariate analyses confirmed the independent prognostic impact of Ang-2 (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.46; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.27-4.76, P = .005), percentage of bone marrow infiltration (HR = 1.14; 95% CI, 1.01-1.29, P = .033), and chemotherapy cycles before HSCT (HR = 1.38; 95% CI, 1.01-1.08, P = .048). Regression tree analysis detected optimal cutoff values for Ang-2 and recursively identified bone marrow blasts and Ang-2 as the best predictors for DFS. Because few predictors for DFS exist in the setting of allo-HSCT, Ang-2 may be used as a readily available powerful biomarker to pre-estimate DFS and may open new perspectives for risk-adapted treatment of high-risk myeloid malignancies.","['Kumpers, Philipp', 'Koenecke, Christian', 'Hecker, Hartmut', 'Hellpap, Julian', 'Horn, Rudiger', 'Verhagen, Willem', 'Buchholz, Stefanie', 'Hertenstein, Bernd', 'Krauter, Jurgen', 'Eder, Matthias', 'David, Sascha', 'Gohring, Gudrun', 'Haller, Hermann', 'Ganser, Arnold']","['Kumpers P', 'Koenecke C', 'Hecker H', 'Hellpap J', 'Horn R', 'Verhagen W', 'Buchholz S', 'Hertenstein B', 'Krauter J', 'Eder M', 'David S', 'Gohring G', 'Haller H', 'Ganser A']","['Center for Internal Medicine, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Angiopoietin-2)', '0 (Biomarkers)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Angiopoietin-2/*blood', 'Biomarkers/blood', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*blood/genetics/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Models, Biological', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*blood/genetics/*therapy', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic', 'Prognosis', 'Regression Analysis', 'Risk Factors', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2008/05/17 09:00,2008/10/01 09:00,['2008/05/17 09:00'],"['2008/05/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/01 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)49653-3 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2007-12-130021 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2008 Sep 1;112(5):2139-48. doi: 10.1182/blood-2007-12-130021.

Here, we characterized the contribution of solute carriers to imatinib transport in an effort to further understand mechanisms involved in the intracellular uptake and retention (IUR) of the drug. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: IUR of [3H]imatinib was studied in Xenopus laevis oocytes and HEK293 cells expressing OATP1A2, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OCT1-3, OCTN1-2, or OAT1-3. Gene expression was determined in nine leukemia cell lines using the Affymetrix U133 array. RESULTS: Imatinib was not found to be a substrate for OCT1 in oocytes (P = 0.21), whereas in HEK293 cells IUR was increased by only 1.20-fold relative to control cells (P = 0.002). Furthermore, in 74 cancer patients, the oral clearance of imatinib was not significantly altered in individuals carrying reduced-function variants in SLC22A1 (P = 0.99). Microarray analysis indicated that SLC22A1 was interrelated with gene expression of various transporters, including ABCB1, ABCC4, ABCG2 (negative), and OATP1A2 (positive). Imatinib was confirmed to be a substrate for the three efflux transporters (P < 0.05) as well as for OATP1A2 (P = 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that SLC22A1 expression is a composite surrogate for expression of various transporters relevant to imatinib IUR.

Such patients might benefit from additional therapy in complete remission (CR). Tipifarnib is an oral farnesyltransferase inhibitor with activity in AML. We conducted a phase II trial of maintenance tipifarnib monotherapy for 48 adults with poor-risk AML in first CR. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Tipifarnib 400 mg twice daily for 14 of 21 days was initiated after recovery from consolidation chemotherapy, for a maximum of 16 cycles (48 weeks). RESULTS: Twenty (42%) patients completed 16 cycles, 24 (50%) were removed from study for relapse, and 4 (8%) discontinued drug prematurely for intolerance. Nonhematologic toxicities were rare, but tipifarnib dose was reduced in 58% for myelosuppression. Median disease-free survival (DFS) was 13.5 months (range, 3.5-59+ months), with 30% having DFS >2 years. Comparison of CR durations for 25 patients who received two-cycle timed sequential therapy followed by tipifarnib maintenance with 23 historically similar patients who did not receive tipifarnib showed that tipifarnib was associated with DFS prolongation for patients with secondary AML and adverse cytogenetics. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that some patients with poor-risk AML, including patients with secondary AML and adverse cytogenetics, may benefit from tipifarnib maintenance therapy. Future studies are warranted to examine alternative tipifarnib dosing and continuation beyond 16 cycles.","['Karp, Judith E', 'Smith, B Douglas', 'Gojo, Ivana', 'Lancet, Jeffrey E', 'Greer, Jacqueline', 'Klein, Maureen', 'Morris, Larry', 'Levis, Mark J', 'Gore, Steven D', 'Wright, John J', 'Garrett-Mayer, Elizabeth']","['Karp JE', 'Smith BD', 'Gojo I', 'Lancet JE', 'Greer J', 'Klein M', 'Morris L', 'Levis MJ', 'Gore SD', 'Wright JJ', 'Garrett-Mayer E']","['Johns Hopkins Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Baltimore, MD 21231-1000, USA. jkarp2@jhmi.edu']",,['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Quinolones)', 'MAT637500A (tipifarnib)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Quinolones/*therapeutic use', 'Remission Induction', 'Risk Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",2008/05/17 09:00,2008/08/19 09:00,['2008/05/17 09:00'],"['2008/05/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/19 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['14/10/3077 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-07-4743 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2008 May 15;14(10):3077-82. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-07-4743.,10,,,"['U01 CA069854-07/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 CA070095/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 69854/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 CA70095/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC3074480,['NIHMS281726'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, TRAIL can also stimulate the proliferation and metastasis of TRAIL-resistant cancer cells. Thus, acquired TRAIL resistance during TRAIL therapy would shift the patient's treatment from beneficial to detrimental. In this study, we focused on the acquired TRAIL resistance mechanism and showed that the elevated expression of the antiapoptotic factor cellular FLICE-like inhibitory protein (c-FLIP) and the prosurvival Bcl-2 family member myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1) underlie the main mechanism of this type of TRAIL resistance in lung cancer cells. Chronic exposure to TRAIL resulted in lung cancer cell resistance to TRAIL-induced cytotoxicity, and this resistance was associated with the increase in the cellular levels of c-FLIP(L) and Mcl-1(L). Overexpresssion of c-FLIP(L) suppressed recruitment of caspase-8 to the death-inducing signaling complex, whereas increased Mcl-1(L) expression blunted the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway. The elevation of c-FLIP(L) and Mcl-1(L) expression was due to Akt-mediated stabilization of these proteins in TRAIL-resistant cells. Importantly, suppressing c-FLIP(L) and Mcl-1(L) expression by RNA interference collectively alleviated acquired TRAIL resistance. Taken together, these results identify c-FLIP(L) and Mcl-1(L) as the major determinants of acquired TRAIL resistance and could be molecular targets for improving the therapeutic value of TRAIL against lung cancer.","['Wang, Xia', 'Chen, Wenshu', 'Zeng, Weihua', 'Bai, Lang', 'Tesfaigzi, Yohannes', 'Belinsky, Steven A', 'Lin, Yong']","['Wang X', 'Chen W', 'Zeng W', 'Bai L', 'Tesfaigzi Y', 'Belinsky SA', 'Lin Y']","['Molecular Biology and Lung Cancer Program, Lovelace Respiratory Research Institute, 2425 Ridgecrest Drive Southeast, Albuquerque, NM 87108, USA.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CASP8 and FADD-Like Apoptosis Regulating Protein)', '0 (Death Domain Receptor Signaling Adaptor Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/metabolism/therapeutic use/*toxicity', 'Apoptosis', 'CASP8 and FADD-Like Apoptosis Regulating Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'Caspase 8/metabolism', 'Cell Death', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Death Domain Receptor Signaling Adaptor Proteins/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/*drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/metabolism/*toxicity']",2008/05/17 09:00,2008/08/23 09:00,['2008/05/17 09:00'],"['2008/05/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/23 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['7/5/1156 [pii]', '10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-07-2183 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2008 May;7(5):1156-63. doi: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-07-2183.,5,,,"['R03 CA125796/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R03 CA125796-01A1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R03 CA125796-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R03CA125796/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC2715176,['NIHMS123493'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we show that reversine causes a failure in cytokinesis and induces polyploidization. These effects of reversine are due to the inhibition of Aurora A and B, two related kinases that are implicated in several aspects of mitosis and that are frequently amplified and overexpressed in human tumors. Reversine inhibits the phosphorylation of histone H3, a direct downstream target of Aurora kinases. Similarly to the Aurora kinase inhibitor VX-680, which has recently entered phase II clinical trials for cancer treatment, reversine inhibited colony formation of leukemic cells from patients with acute myeloid leukemia but was significantly less toxic than VX-680 on cells from healthy donors. The crystal structure of the reversine-Aurora B kinase complex shows that reversine is a novel class of ATP-competitive Aurora kinase inhibitors. Thus, although our studies raise serious doubts on the application of reversine in regenerative medicine, they support the paradigm that reversine might be a useful agent in cancer chemotherapy.","[""D'Alise, Anna Morena"", 'Amabile, Giovanni', 'Iovino, Mariangela', 'Di Giorgio, Francesco Paolo', 'Bartiromo, Marta', 'Sessa, Fabio', 'Villa, Fabrizio', 'Musacchio, Andrea', 'Cortese, Riccardo']","[""D'Alise AM"", 'Amabile G', 'Iovino M', 'Di Giorgio FP', 'Bartiromo M', 'Sessa F', 'Villa F', 'Musacchio A', 'Cortese R']","['CEINGE, Biotecnologie Avanzate, Via Comunale Margherita 482, 80131 Naples, Italy.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Morpholines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Purines)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (AURKB protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Aurora Kinase B)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Aurora Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'Z499CLJ023 (2-(4-morpholinoanilino)-6-cyclohexylaminopurine)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Aurora Kinase B', 'Aurora Kinases', 'Binding Sites/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'HeLa Cells', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*enzymology', 'Models, Molecular', 'Morpholines/chemistry/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Polyploidy', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/metabolism', 'Purines/chemistry/metabolism/*pharmacology']",2008/05/17 09:00,2008/08/23 09:00,['2008/05/17 09:00'],"['2008/05/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/23 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['7/5/1140 [pii]', '10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-07-2051 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2008 May;7(5):1140-9. doi: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-07-2051.,5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we report that the novel triterpenoid methyl-2-cyano-3,12-dioxooleana-1,9-diene-28-oate (CDDO-Me) potently induced cytotoxicity in imatinib-resistant KBM5 cells expressing the T315I mutation of bcr-abl (24-h EC50, 540 nmol/L). In long-term culture, CDDO-Me abrogated the growth of human parental KBM5 and KBM5-STI cells with 96-h IC50 of 205 and 221 nmol/L, respectively. In addition, CDDO-Me rapidly decreased the viability of murine lymphoid Ba/F3 cells expressing wild-type p210 as well as the imatinib-resistant E255K and T315I mutations of bcr-abl. The low-dose effects of CDDO-Me are associated with inhibition of mitochondrial oxygen consumption, whereas the cytotoxic effects appear to be mediated by a rapid and selective depletion of mitochondrial glutathione that accompanies the increased generation of reactive oxygen species and mitochondrial dysfunction. Interestingly, the mitochondriotoxic effects of CDDO-Me are followed by the rapid autophagocytosis of intracellular organelles or the externalization of phosphatidylserine in different cell types. We conclude that alterations in mitochondrial function by CDDO-Me can result in autophagy or apoptosis of chronic myeloid leukemia cells regardless of the mutational status of bcr-abl. CDDO-Me is in clinical trials and shows signs of clinical activity, with minimal side effects and complete lack of cardiotoxicity.

Sorafenib and sunitinib were potent inhibitors of cells with fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 internal tandem duplication (IC50, 2 and 7 nmol/L) and c-KIT N822K mutations (IC50, 23 and 40 nmol/L). In four cell lines (MV4-11, Kasumi-1, KG-1, and U937) that spanned a range of drug sensitivities, sorafenib and sunitinib had similar activity in apoptosis and cell cycle assays, except that sunitinib did not promote apoptosis in U937 cells. Both drugs inhibited mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling but had no effect on AKT signaling in most of the cell lines tested. Sorafenib was substantially more bound than sunitinib in human plasma (unbound fraction, 0.59% versus 8.4%) and cell culture medium (unbound fraction, 1.3% versus 39%), indicating that sorafenib was more potent than sunitinib and that unbound sorafenib concentrations with activity against most AML cell lines are achievable in vivo. There was more intracellular accumulation of sorafenib than of sunitinib and imatinib in AML cells. Between 1 and 10 micromol/L, sorafenib inhibited the proliferation of six of nine primary AML blast samples by > or =50%.

Cancer cell growth and progression are associated with high levels of PI3K/Akt activation by loss of PTEN expression and the inactivation of p53 by MDM2 overexpression. We report that inhibition of PI3K/Akt, either by the PI3K inhibitor Ly294002 or by expression of PTEN, synergized the ability of the MDM2 antagonist nutlin-3 to induce apoptosis in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). We used a set of ALL cell lines with wild-type p53 and MDM2 overexpression, but different status of PTEN expression/PI3K/Akt activation, to test the ability of nutlin-3 to induce p53 and apoptosis. Nutlin-3 activated p53 in all the ALL cell lines; however, induction of apoptosis was dependent on PTEN status. Nutlin-3 induced potent apoptosis in cells with PTEN expression but not in those without PTEN, suggesting that PTEN/PI3K/Akt pathway may play a role in this process. Furthermore, nutlin-3 significantly down-regulated survivin expression in PTEN-positive cells but not in PTEN-negative cells. When these nutlin-3-resistant cells were either pretransfected with the PTEN gene or simultaneously treated with the PI3K inhibitor Ly294002, survivin was down-regulated and sensitivity to nutlin-3 was increased. Furthermore, direct silencing of survivin by small interfering RNA also increased the proapoptotic effect of nutlin-3 on the PTEN-negative, nutlin-3-resistant ALL cells. Our results suggest that Akt-mediated survivin up-regulation in PTEN-negative ALL cells may counteract the proapoptotic effect of nutlin-3, and indicate that a combination of MDM2 antagonist and PI3K/Akt inhibitor may be a promising approach for treating refractory ALL.","['Zhu, Ningxi', 'Gu, Lubing', 'Li, Fengzhi', 'Zhou, Muxiang']","['Zhu N', 'Gu L', 'Li F', 'Zhou M']","['Department of Pediatrics, Emory University School of Medicine, 2015 Uppergate Drive, Atlanta, GA 30322, USA.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,"['0 (BIRC5 protein, human)', '0 (Chromones)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Morpholines)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Survivin)', '31M2U1DVID (2-(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)', '53IA0V845C (nutlin 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN Phosphohydrolase)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN protein, human)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Death', 'Chromones/pharmacology', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/*pharmacology', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Morpholines/pharmacology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'PTEN Phosphohydrolase/metabolism', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Survivin', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2008/05/17 09:00,2008/08/23 09:00,['2008/05/17 09:00'],"['2008/05/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/23 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['7/5/1101 [pii]', '10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-08-0179 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2008 May;7(5):1101-9. doi: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-08-0179.,5,,,['R01 CA123490/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However resistance to the drug emerges at the advanced phases of the disease. Therefore, novel therapy models remained to be designed. We have developed a novel dual targeted agent termed ""combi-molecule"" designed to not only block Bcr-Abl but also damage DNA. ZRF1, the first optimized prototype of the approach, was ""programmed"" to degrade into another inhibitor ZRF0 plus a methyl diazonium species. It was approximately 2-fold stronger Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor than Imatinib and a more potent DNA-damaging agent than Temodal. In the p53 wild-type Mo7p210 cells, the potency of ZRF1 was approximately 1,000-fold superior to that of the equieffective combinations of Imatinib plus Temodal. More importantly, its superior potency over Imatinib was more pronounced in Bcr-Abl-positive cells coexpressing wild-type p53. Studies to rationalize these results showed that, through its Bcr-Abl inhibitory function, it down-regulated p53. However, sufficient level of the latter protein was available for transactivating p21 and Bax, which are required for cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. The results suggest that, in p53 wild-type cells, apoptosis is induced not only through Bcr-Abl inhibition but also through the p53-controlled DNA-damaging pathway, leading to an additive effect that translates into enhanced cell death. The study conclusively showed that p53 is a major determinant for the cytotoxic advantages of the novel combi-molecular approach in CML, a disease in which 70% to 85% of all the cases express wild-type p53.","['Katsoulas, Athanasia', 'Rachid, Zakaria', 'McNamee, James P', 'Williams, Christopher', 'Jean-Claude, Bertrand J']","['Katsoulas A', 'Rachid Z', 'McNamee JP', 'Williams C', 'Jean-Claude BJ']","['Cancer Drug Research Laboratory, Department of Medicine, Division of Medical Oncology, McGill University Health Center/Royal Victoria Hospital, 687 Pine Avenue West, M7.19, Montreal, Quebec, Canada H3A 1A1.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (DNAJC2 protein, human)', '0 (Molecular Chaperones)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '7GR28W0FJI (Dacarbazine)', 'YF1K15M17Y (Temozolomide)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Proliferation', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Dacarbazine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Genes, abl', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Models, Biological', 'Molecular Chaperones', 'Oncogene Proteins/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'RNA-Binding Proteins', 'Temozolomide', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism']",2008/05/17 09:00,2008/08/23 09:00,['2008/05/17 09:00'],"['2008/05/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/23 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['7/5/1033 [pii]', '10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-07-0179 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2008 May;7(5):1033-43. doi: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-07-0179.,5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, many cancers fail immune interventions, and secretion of immunosuppressive factors, defective antigen presentation, and expression of death ligands or serpins are regarded as main escape mechanisms. Here, we study whether deregulation of growth and survival factor signaling, which is encountered in most human cancers, provides another level of protection against immunologic tumor eradication. We show in two models that activated cell autonomous protein kinase B (PKB)/AKT signaling mediates resistance against tumor suppression by antigen-specific CTLs in vitro and adoptively transferred cellular immune effectors in vivo. PKB/AKT-dependent immunoresistance of established tumors is reversed by genetic suppression of endogenous Mcl-1, an antiapoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family. Mechanistically, deregulated PKB/AKT stabilizes Mcl-1 expression in a mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)-dependent pathway. Treatment with the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin effectively sensitizes established cancers to adoptive immunotherapy in vivo. In conclusion, cancer cell-intrinsic PKB/AKT signaling regulates the susceptibility to immune-mediated cytotoxicity. Combined targeting of signal transduction pathways may be critical for improvement of cancer immunotherapies.","['Hahnel, Patricia S', 'Thaler, Sonja', 'Antunes, Edite', 'Huber, Christoph', 'Theobald, Matthias', 'Schuler, Martin']","['Hahnel PS', 'Thaler S', 'Antunes E', 'Huber C', 'Theobald M', 'Schuler M']","['Department of Medicine (Cancer Research), West German Cancer Center, University Hospital Essen, Essen, Germany.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (mTOR protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Coculture Techniques', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/*methods', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Models, Biological', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Neoplasms/*enzymology/immunology', 'Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases']",2008/05/17 09:00,2008/06/25 09:00,['2008/05/17 09:00'],"['2008/05/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/25 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['68/10/3899 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-6286 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2008 May 15;68(10):3899-906. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-6286.,10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We observe that the activated (autophosphorylated) Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IIgamma (CaMKIIgamma) is invariably present in myeloid leukemia cell lines as well as in the majority of primary acute myelogenous leukemia patient samples. In contrast, myeloid leukemia cells induced to terminally differentiate or undergo growth arrest display a marked reduction in this CaMKIIgamma autophosphorylation. In cells harboring the bcr-abl oncogene, the activation (autophosphorylation) of CaMKIIgamma is regulated by this oncogene. Moreover, inhibition of CaMKIIgamma activity with pharmacologic agents, dominant-negative constructs, or short hairpin RNAs inhibits the proliferation of myeloid leukemia cells, and this is associated with the inactivation/down-regulation of multiple critical signal transduction networks involving the mitogen-activated protein kinase, Janus-activated kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription (Jak/Stat), and glycogen synthase kinase (GSK3beta)/beta-catenin pathways. In myeloid leukemia cells, CaMKIIgamma directly phosphorylates Stat3 and enhances its transcriptional activity. Thus, CaMKIIgamma is a critical regulator of multiple signaling networks regulating the proliferation of myeloid leukemia cells.

Moreover, APRIL did not significantly enhance the induction of T cell lymphomas upon Moloney murine leukemia virus (MLV) infection. This clearly contrasts current belief and indicates that APRIL does not serve a major role in T cell immunity or lymphomagenesis. However, we did observe a strong increase in erythroleukemia formation after MLV inoculation of APRIL Tg mice. Strikingly, this erythroleukemia-facilitating property of APRIL was confirmed using the erythroleukemogenic Friend-MLV. Erythroleukemia in APRIL Tg mice was characterized by low hematocrits and grossly enlarged spleens with an increased percentage of erythroid precursors.

MLL-related leukemia is coincident with increased expression of a subset of HOX genes, including HOXA9. MLL functions to maintain, rather than initiate, expression of its target genes. However, the mechanism of MLL maintenance of target gene expression is not understood. Here, we demonstrate that Mll binds to specific clusters of CpG residues within the Hoxa9 locus and regulates expression of multiple transcripts. The presence of Mll at these clusters provides protection from DNA methylation. shRNA knock-down of Mll reverses the methylation protection status at the previously protected CpG clusters; methylation at these CpG residues is similar to that observed in Mll null cells. Furthermore, reconstituting MLL expression in Mll null cells can reverse DNA methylation of the same CpG residues, demonstrating a dominant effect of MLL in protecting this specific region from DNA methylation. Intriguingly, an oncogenic MLL-AF4 fusion can also reverse DNA methylation, but only for a subset of these CpGs. This method of transcriptional regulation suggests a mechanism that explains the role of Mll in transcriptional maintenance, but it may extend to other CpG DNA binding proteins. Protection from methylation may be an important mechanism of epigenetic inheritance by regulating the function of both de novo and maintenance DNA methyltransferases.","['Erfurth, Frank E', 'Popovic, Relja', 'Grembecka, Jolanta', 'Cierpicki, Tomasz', 'Theisler, Catherine', 'Xia, Zhen-Biao', 'Stuart, Tara', 'Diaz, Manuel O', 'Bushweller, John H', 'Zeleznik-Le, Nancy J']","['Erfurth FE', 'Popovic R', 'Grembecka J', 'Cierpicki T', 'Theisler C', 'Xia ZB', 'Stuart T', 'Diaz MO', 'Bushweller JH', 'Zeleznik-Le NJ']","['Oncology Institute, Molecular Biology Program, Department of Medicine, Loyola University Chicago, Maywood, IL 60153, USA.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (homeobox protein HOXA9)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', '*CpG Islands', '*DNA Methylation', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic']",2008/05/17 09:00,2008/06/17 09:00,['2008/05/17 09:00'],"['2008/05/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['0800090105 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.0800090105 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2008 May 27;105(21):7517-22. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0800090105.

They included cases, participating controls, and first-choice nonparticipating controls in their analyses. Exposure was assessed by wire coding, a classification system based on the distribution line characteristics near homes. Although an imperfect measure of magnetic field exposure, wire coding is the only method applicable to nonparticipating subjects. First-choice nonparticipant controls tended to be of lower socioeconomic status than their replacements (non-first-choice participant controls), and lower socioeconomic status was related to higher wire code categories. The odds ratios for developing childhood leukemia in the highest exposure category were 1.6 (95% confidence interval: 1.0, 2.6) when the actual participating controls were used and 1.3 (95% confidence interval: 0.8, 2.1) when the first-choice ideal controls were used, regardless of their participation. Overall, the authors conclude that, although there is some evidence for control selection or participation bias in the Canadian study, it is unlikely to explain entirely the observed association between magnetic field exposure and childhood leukemia. Inherent problems in exposure assessment for nonparticipating subjects, however, limit the interpretations of these results, and the role of selection bias cannot entirely be dismissed on the basis of these results alone.","['Mezei, Gabor', 'Spinelli, John J', 'Wong, Paul', 'Borugian, Marilyn', 'McBride, Mary L']","['Mezei G', 'Spinelli JJ', 'Wong P', 'Borugian M', 'McBride ML']","['Electric Power Research Institute, Palo Alto, CA, USA. gmezei@epri.com']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Epidemiol,American journal of epidemiology,7910653,,IM,"['Canada/epidemiology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Electromagnetic Fields/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Odds Ratio', 'Prevalence', 'Residence Characteristics', 'Risk Assessment', '*Selection Bias', 'Social Class']",2008/05/17 09:00,2008/07/04 09:00,['2008/05/17 09:00'],"['2008/05/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/04 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['kwn086 [pii]', '10.1093/aje/kwn086 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Epidemiol. 2008 Jun 15;167(12):1504-10. doi: 10.1093/aje/kwn086.

It has been reported that arsenic trioxide (ATO), a potent cancer chemotherapeutic agent, in particular for acute promyelocytic leukemia, activates the Chk2/p53 pathway, leading to apoptosis. ATO is also known to activate the p38 MAPK/p53 pathway. Here we show that phosphatase activities of purified Wip1 toward phosphorylated Chk2 and p38 in vitro are inhibited by ATO in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, DNA damage-induced phosphorylation of Chk2 and p38 in cultured cells is suppressed by ectopic expression of Wip1, and this Wip1-mediated suppression can be restored by the presence of ATO. We also show that treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia cells with ATO resulted in induction of phosphorylation and activation of Chk2 and p38 MAPK, which are required for ATO-induced apoptosis. Importantly, this ATO-induced activation of Chk2/p53 and p38 MAPK/p53 apoptotic pathways can be enhanced by siRNA-mediated suppression of Wip1 expression, further indicating that ATO inhibits Wip1 phosphatase in vivo. These results exemplify that Wip1 is a direct molecular target of ATO.","['Yoda, Akinori', 'Toyoshima, Kyoko', 'Watanabe, Yasuhide', 'Onishi, Nobuyuki', 'Hazaka, Yuki', 'Tsukuda, Yusuke', 'Tsukada, Junichi', 'Kondo, Takeshi', 'Tanaka, Yoshiya', 'Minami, Yasuhiro']","['Yoda A', 'Toyoshima K', 'Watanabe Y', 'Onishi N', 'Hazaka Y', 'Tsukuda Y', 'Tsukada J', 'Kondo T', 'Tanaka Y', 'Minami Y']","['Department of Physiology and Cell Biology, Faculty of Medical Sciences, Graduate School of Medicine, Kobe University, 7-5-1, Kusunoki-cho, Chuo-ku, Kobe 650-0017, Japan.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.1.11 (Checkpoint Kinase 2)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (ATM protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (CHEK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (CHEK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Checkpoint Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (PPM1D protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Phosphoprotein Phosphatases)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Protein Phosphatase 2C)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/genetics', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Checkpoint Kinase 1', 'Checkpoint Kinase 2', 'DNA Damage/drug effects/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects/genetics', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy/*enzymology/genetics', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/drug effects/genetics', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'Phosphoprotein Phosphatases/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Protein Kinases/genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Phosphatase 2C', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/genetics/metabolism']",2008/05/17 09:00,2008/08/20 09:00,['2008/05/17 09:00'],"['2008/05/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/20 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(20)81497-5 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M800560200 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2008 Jul 4;283(27):18969-79. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M800560200.

TPMT is a major pharmacogenomic target with 23 alleles identified to date. Several of these alleles cause rapid protein degradation and/or aggregation, making it extremely difficult to study the structural impact of the TPMT polymorphisms experimentally. We, therefore, have performed multiple molecular dynamics simulations of the four most common alleles [TPMT*2 (A80P), *3A (A154T/Y240C), *3B (A154T) and *3C (Y240C)] to investigate the molecular mechanism of TPMT inactivation at an atomic level. The A80P polymorphism in TPMT*2 disrupts helix alpha3 bordering the active site, which breaks several salt-bridge interactions and opens up a large cleft in the protein. The A154T polymorphism is located within the co-substrate binding site. The larger threonine alters the packing of substrate-binding residues (P68, L69, Y166), increasing the solvent exposure of the polymorphic site. This packing rearrangement may account for the complete lack of activity in the A154T mutant. The Y240C polymorphism is located in beta-strand 9, distant from the active site. Side-chain contacts between residue 240 and helix alpha8 are lost in TPMT*3C. Residues 154 and 240 in TPMT*3A are connected through a hydrogen-bonding network. The dual polymorphisms result in a flattened, slightly distorted protein structure and an increase in the thiopurine-binding site solvent accessibility. The two variants that undergo the most rapid degradation in vivo, TPMT*2 and *3A, are also the most deformed in the simulations.","['Rutherford, Karen', 'Daggett, Valerie']","['Rutherford K', 'Daggett V']","['Department of Biochemistry, University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98195-5013, USA.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Mol Biol,Journal of molecular biology,2985088R,"['0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.67 (thiopurine methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Alleles', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Catalytic Domain/genetics', 'Enzyme Stability', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Bonding', 'Methyltransferases/antagonists & inhibitors/*chemistry/*genetics/metabolism', 'Models, Molecular', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Protein Conformation', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Recombinant Proteins/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Thermodynamics', 'Ubiquitination']",2008/05/17 09:00,2008/06/20 09:00,['2008/05/17 09:00'],"['2008/01/14 00:00 [received]', '2008/03/29 00:00 [revised]', '2008/04/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/05/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0022-2836(08)00461-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jmb.2008.04.032 [doi]']",ppublish,J Mol Biol. 2008 Jun 13;379(4):803-14. doi: 10.1016/j.jmb.2008.04.032.

The aim of this study was to investigate the differences in perception of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) among children, parents and paediatricians at the time of diagnosis and after initial treatment in four chronic diseases. METHODS: HRQoL was assessed with the Health Utilities Index mark 3 (HUI3). The HUI3 consists of eight attributes (vision, hearing, speech, ambulation, dexterity, emotion, cognition and pain). RESULTS: Nineteen paediatricians and 60 patients (aged 10-17 years) and their parents with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, asthma or with cystic fibrosis admitted for pneumonia participated in the study. Health and well-being perceptions were clearly different among paediatricians, parents and patients, both at diagnosis and after initial treatment. Perception differences were more prominent in the subjective attributes, emotion and pain. The agreement for these attributes was 23% and 5%, respectively. Paediatricians assessed the patients to have less pain than the patients and parents did. The reverse was true for the attribute emotion. At follow-up, the agreement was higher for the attributes ambulation and pain. CONCLUSION: At the onset of a chronic disease and after initial treatment, paediatricians, parents and children have different perceptions of the child's quality of life, particularly as to the subjective attributes pain and emotion. In view of these differences in perception among patients, their caregivers and paediatricians, this study suggests that whenever possible, multi-respondent assessment of HRQoL should be considered.","['Janse, A J', 'Sinnema, G', 'Uiterwaal, C S P M', 'Kimpen, J L L', 'Gemke, R J B J']","['Janse AJ', 'Sinnema G', 'Uiterwaal CS', 'Kimpen JL', 'Gemke RJ']","[""Department of Pediatrics, Wilhelmina Children's Hospital, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands.""]",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],Norway,Acta Paediatr,"Acta paediatrica (Oslo, Norway : 1992)",9205968,,IM,"['Adolescent', '*Attitude of Health Personnel', '*Attitude to Health', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chronic Disease/*epidemiology/*psychology', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Health Status Indicators', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Observer Variation', '*Parents', 'Quality of Life/*psychology', '*Surveys and Questionnaires']",2008/05/17 09:00,2008/11/19 09:00,['2008/05/17 09:00'],"['2008/05/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/11/19 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['APA847 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1651-2227.2008.00847.x [doi]']",ppublish,Acta Paediatr. 2008 Aug;97(8):1118-24. doi: 10.1111/j.1651-2227.2008.00847.x.

BACKGROUND: Diagnosis of leukaemia in children leads to an existential shock for parents and a reversal of normal family life. Today, in the Netherlands, after diagnosis, children stay at home most of the time. Therefore, their parents face considerable responsibilities for administering home-based treatment and for the support of their child during illness and treatment. METHODS: A grounded theory study was undertaken at a Dutch University Hospital and involved one-time individual in-depth interviews with 12 mothers and 11 fathers (n = 23) of 12 children. FINDINGS: 'Being there', was identified as the core concept. It means: 'I'll be there for you; I will never let you down'. 'Being there' is described as a parental response to the perceived vulnerability of the child and the parental need to give meaning to parenthood. It serves two purposes: protection and preservation. Protection means guarding the child against the negative aspects of illness and treatment. Preservation refers to the way parents influence the child's perception of his/her life, thus contributing to his/her coping and willingness to undergo treatment, to maximise the chances for survival. Six aspects were identified: a trusting relationship, presence, emotional support, advocacy, routines and rituals and effacing oneself. CONCLUSIONS: The concept provides a theoretical frame for parenting the child with cancer. It clarifies the actions and reactions of parents and increases insight into the underlying force that enables parents to provide continuing care despite their personal burden. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: The concept offers an essential insight into parenting the child with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and has relevance for nursing practice and education. Understanding of the concept would improve the ability to understand, communicate and work pro-actively in partnership with parents.","['Kars, Marijke C', 'Duijnstee, Mia S H', 'Pool, Aart', 'van Delden, Johannes J M', 'Grypdonck, Mieke H F']","['Kars MC', 'Duijnstee MS', 'Pool A', 'van Delden JJ', 'Grypdonck MH']","['University Medical Centre Utrecht, Julius Centre for Health Sciences and Primary Care, Department Nursing Science, Utrecht, The Netherlands.

Here we report that CP-690,550 exerts greater antiproliferative and pro-apoptotic activity against cells harboring JAK2(V617F) compared with JAK2(WT). CP-690,550 treatment of murine factor-dependent cell Patersen-erythropoietin receptor (FDCP-EpoR) cells harboring human wild-type or V617F JAK2 resulted in inhibition of cell proliferation with a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) of 2.1 microM and 0.25 microM, respectively. Moreover, CP-690,550 induced a significant pro-apoptotic effect on murine FDCP-EpoR cells carrying JAK2(V617F), whereas a lesser effect was observed for cells carrying wild-type JAK2. This activity was coupled with inhibition of phosphorylation of the key JAK2(V617F)-dependent downstream signaling effectors signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)3, STAT5, and v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog (AKT). Furthermore, CP-690,550 treatment of ex-vivo-expanded erythroid progenitors from JAK2(V617F)-positive PV patients resulted in specific, antiproliferative (IC(50) = 0.2 microM) and pro-apoptotic activity. In contrast, expanded progenitors from healthy controls were less sensitive to CP-690,550 in proliferation (IC(50) > 1.0 microM), and apoptosis assays. The antiproliferative effect on expanded patient progenitors was paralleled by a decrease in JAK2(V617F) mutant allele frequency, particularly in a patient homozygous for JAK2(V617F). Flow cytometric analysis of expanded PV progenitor cells treated with CP-690,550 suggests a possible transition towards a pattern of erythroid differentiation resembling expanded cells from normal healthy controls.","['Manshouri, Taghi', 'Quintas-Cardama, Alfonso', 'Nussenzveig, Roberto H', 'Gaikwad, Amos', 'Estrov, Zeev', 'Prchal, Josef', 'Cortes, Jorge E', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M', 'Verstovsek, Srdan']","['Manshouri T', 'Quintas-Cardama A', 'Nussenzveig RH', 'Gaikwad A', 'Estrov Z', 'Prchal J', 'Cortes JE', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Verstovsek S']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas, M D Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,"['0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Pyrroles)', '0 (Receptors, Erythropoietin)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', '87LA6FU830 (tofacitinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Nucleus/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Erythropoietin/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Janus Kinase 2/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Mice', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Piperidines', 'Polycythemia Vera/*drug therapy/enzymology/pathology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Protein Transport', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrroles/*therapeutic use', 'Receptors, Erythropoietin/genetics/metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects']",2008/05/17 09:00,2008/06/20 09:00,['2008/05/17 09:00'],"['2008/05/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['CAS817 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1349-7006.2008.00817.x [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2008 Jun;99(6):1265-73. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.2008.00817.x.,6,,,"['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '16672/PHS HHS/United States', 'R00 CA166729/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC4829954,['NIHMS772562'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, the effect of lucidenic acids (A, B, C, and N) isolated from a new G. lucidum (YK-02) on induction of cell apoptosis and the apoptotic pathway in HL-60 cells were investigated. The results demonstrated that lucidenic acids decreased cell population growth of HL-60 cells, assessed with the MTT assay. The cell cycle assay indicated that treatment of HL-60 cells with lucidenic acid A, C, and N caused cell cycle arrest in the G 1 phase. Lucidenic acid B (LAB) did not affect the cell cycle profile; however, it increased the number of early and late apoptotic cells but not necrotic cells. Treatment of HL-60 cells with LAB caused loss of mitochondria membrane potential. Moreover, the ratio of expression levels of pro- and antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members was changed by LAB treatment. LAB-induced apoptosis involved release of mitochondria cytochrome c and subsequently induced the activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3, which were followed by cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). Pretreatment with a general caspase-9 inhibitor (Z-LEHD-FMK) and caspase-3 inhibitor (Z-DEVD-FMK) prevented LAB from inhibiting cell viability in HL-60 cells.

The leukemia cell line C1498 transduced with a potentially immunodominant antigen (ovalbumin) was used to track expansion and functionality of antigen-specific cytotoxic T cell (CTL), both in vitro and in vivo. Three times more leukemia-specific CTL could be generated when compared with the respective controls. CTL generated after increasing the antigen-specific T-cell precursor frequency in vitro cured up to 80% of mice bearing leukemia with the respective antigen (P < 0.005, as compared with controls). Alternatively, the yield of CTL reactive to a immunodominant neoantigen increased by factor 2 to 6 when T-cell donors were immunized with dendritic cell presenting the respective antigen.

The condition is lethal within a few months without treatment, but most young patients reach complete remission with chemotherapy. Many of them will relapse after a while, but an increasing number of young people survive for a long time. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Survival data were retrieved from the Norwegian Registry for Acute Leukemias and Lymphoblastic Lymphomas for patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (aged from 16 to 60 years) who were registered in the period 1.1.2000-31.12.2005. The patients were divided in risk groups according to karyotype and response to initial chemotherapy. Patients with secondary acute myelogenous leukemia were classified as high-risk. RESULTS AND INTERPRETATION: 4-year survival was 94.5% in acute promyelocytic leukemia, 77.7% in other low-risk acute myelogenous leukemia, 39.0% in standard risk patients and 29.1% in high-risk patients. For all patients totally 4-year survival was 43.0%. This is an increase of about 15% compared to previous Norwegian studies. The increase is most probably due to an intensification of chemotherapy after remission and to the implementation of all-trans-retinoic acid in the treatment of promyelocytic leukemia.","['Tangen, Jon-Magnus', 'Floisand, Yngvar', 'Foss-Abrahamsen, Jenny', 'Haukas, Einar', 'Naess, Inger Anne', 'Skjelbakken, Tove']","['Tangen JM', 'Floisand Y', 'Foss-Abrahamsen J', 'Haukas E', 'Naess IA', 'Skjelbakken T']","['Hematologisk avdeling, Ulleval universitetssykehus, 0407 Oslo. tangen.jon-magnus@uus.no']",,['nor'],"['Comparative Study', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Norway,Tidsskr Nor Laegeforen,"Tidsskrift for den Norske laegeforening : tidsskrift for praktisk medicin, ny raekke",0413423,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/genetics/*mortality', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy/genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/mortality', 'Norway/epidemiology', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate']",2008/05/16 09:00,2008/06/17 09:00,['2008/05/16 09:00'],"['2008/05/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/16 09:00 [entrez]']",['1688903 [pii]'],ppublish,Tidsskr Nor Laegeforen. 2008 May 15;128(10):1164-7.,10,,,,,,,,Overlevelse hos voksne med akutt myelogen leukemi.,,"['Tidsskr Nor Laegeforen. 2008 Aug 14;128(15):1681-2; author reply 1682.

Pharmacologic blockade of Hsp90 has consistently been found to induce MM cell death. However, most data have been obtained with MM cell lines whereas knowledge about the molecular effects of pharmacologic Hsp90 blockade in primary tumour cells is limited. Furthermore, these investigations have so far focused on geldanamycin derivatives. We analysed the biochemical effects of a novel diarylisoxazole-based Hsp90 inhibitor (NVP-AUY922) on signalling pathways and cell death in a large set of primary MM tumour samples and in MM cell lines. Treated cells displayed the molecular signature and pharmacodynamic properties for abrogation of Hsp90 function, such as downregulation of multiple survival pathways and strong upregulation of Hsp70. NVP-AUY922 treatment efficiently induced MM cell apoptosis and revealed both sensitive and resistant subgroups. Sensitivity was not correlated with TP53 mutation or Hsp70 induction levels and stromal cells from the bone marrow microenvironment were unable to abrogate NVP-AUY922-induced apoptosis of MM cells. Thus, NVP-AUY922 may be a promising drug for treatment of MM and clinical studies are warranted.","['Stuhmer, T', 'Zollinger, A', 'Siegmund, D', 'Chatterjee, M', 'Grella, E', 'Knop, S', 'Kortum, M', 'Unzicker, C', 'Jensen, M R', 'Quadt, C', 'Chene, P', 'Schoepfer, J', 'Garcia-Echeverria, C', 'Einsele, H', 'Wajant, H', 'Bargou, R C']","['Stuhmer T', 'Zollinger A', 'Siegmund D', 'Chatterjee M', 'Grella E', 'Knop S', 'Kortum M', 'Unzicker C', 'Jensen MR', 'Quadt C', 'Chene P', 'Schoepfer J', 'Garcia-Echeverria C', 'Einsele H', 'Wajant H', 'Bargou RC']","['Department of Internal Medicine II, Division of Hematology, University Hospital Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany. stuehmer_t@medizin.uni-wuerzburg.de']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0', '(5-(2,4-dihydroxy-5-isopropylphenyl)-4-(4-morpholin-4-ylmethylphenyl)isoxazole-3-', 'carboxylic acid ethylamide)', '0 (HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Isoxazoles)', '0 (Resorcinols)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Coculture Techniques', 'HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Isoxazoles/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Multiple Myeloma/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Resorcinols/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', '*Signal Transduction']",2008/05/16 09:00,2008/09/13 09:00,['2008/05/16 09:00'],"['2008/05/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/13 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['leu2008111 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2008.111 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2008 Aug;22(8):1604-12. doi: 10.1038/leu.2008.111.

Twenty ET were studied by microarray analysis and the results were confirmed by real-time quantitative RT-PCR in 40 ET patients, not receiving cytoreductive treatment. A heterogeneous molecular signature characterized by two main gene expression patterns was found: one with an upregulation of inflammatory genes related to neutrophil activation and thrombosis, and the other with significantly lower expression of these genes. Supervised clustering analysis showed 30 genes differentially expressed between JAK2V617F-negative and JAK2V617F-positive ET patients. Among the JAK2V617F-negative, a set of 14 genes (CISH, C13orf18, CCL3, PIM1, MAFF, SOCS3, ID2, GADD45B, KLF5, TNF, LAMB3, HRH4, TAGAP and TRIB1) showed an abnormal expression pattern. In this group of patients, CISH, SOCS2, SOCS3 and PIM1 genes, all involved in JAK-STAT signalling pathway, presented a lower expression. A two-gene predictor model was built comprising FOSB and CISH genes, which were the best discriminators of JAK2V617F status. In conclusion, JAK2V617F-negative ET patients present a characteristic gene expression profile, different from JAK2V617F-positive patients. Other pathways, besides JAK-STAT, might be implicated in the pathophysiology of JAK2V617F-negative ET patients.","['Puigdecanet, E', 'Espinet, B', 'Lozano, J J', 'Sumoy, L', 'Bellosillo, B', 'Arenillas, L', 'Alvarez-Larran, A', 'Sole, F', 'Serrano, S', 'Besses, C', 'Florensa, L']","['Puigdecanet E', 'Espinet B', 'Lozano JJ', 'Sumoy L', 'Bellosillo B', 'Arenillas L', 'Alvarez-Larran A', 'Sole F', 'Serrano S', 'Besses C', 'Florensa L']","['Laboratori de Citogenetica i Biologia Molecular, Servei de Patologia.

In the upcoming fourth edition of the WHO fascicle, due out later this year, the term 'MPD' is replaced by 'myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN)'. Accordingly, the term MDS/MPD is being replaced by 'MDS/MPN' that will be used in this review. Although much progress has been made in understanding the molecular pathogenesis of myeloid neoplasms, most of the diseases included in the group of MDS/MPN still remain 'clinicopathologically assigned'. In other words, they can only be accurately categorized by a careful multiparametric approach that is based on the integration of bone marrow and peripheral blood morphology with other laboratory and clinical findings. The current 'spotlight' review provides practical guidelines, which should allow for a reproducible classification of these uncommon neoplasms when encountered in clinical practice.","['Orazi, A', 'Germing, U']","['Orazi A', 'Germing U']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Clarian Pathology Laboratory, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN 46202, USA. aorazi@iupui.edu']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Chromatin)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Anemia, Refractory/classification', 'Chromatin/chemistry', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/classification/diagnosis/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/classification/diagnosis/genetics', 'Mutation', 'Myelodysplastic-Myeloproliferative Diseases/*classification', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*classification', 'Prognosis']",2008/05/16 09:00,2008/08/30 09:00,['2008/05/16 09:00'],"['2008/05/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/30 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['leu2008119 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2008.119 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2008 Jul;22(7):1308-19. doi: 10.1038/leu.2008.119.

Thus, we hypothesized that LIF expression might be altered during in-stent neointimal hyperplasia. Ossabaw miniature swine, a unique large-animal model of metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease, were used for these studies. Bare-metal stents were deployed in the left anterior descending and left circumflex coronary arteries. Stents were expanded to either 1.0 x luminal diameter (in accordance with current clinical practice) or 1.3 x (overexpansion). The development of in-stent neointimal hyperplasia was assessed 28-day postimplantation using intravascular ultrasound. The atherosclerotic coverage of the vessel wall was approximately five-fold higher in 1.0 x stents and approximately nine-fold higher in 1.3 x stents 4 weeks after deployment, compared with the same segments before stenting. LIF mRNA was elevated approximately 11-fold in stented segments, relative to unstented epicardial coronary arteries. LIF expression and the intima : media ratio were strongly correlated in 1.0 x stented vessels. Further studies to investigate the nature of the association between LIF and neointimal hyperplasia revealed that vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation was inhibited by LIF treatment in an in-vitro model of atherosclerosis (coronary artery organ culture). These novel and clinically relevant studies show that elevated LIF gene expression is predictive for in-stent neointimal hyperplasia, and suggest that LIF upregulation may be a compensatory mechanism in this setting.","['Lloyd, Pamela G', 'Sheehy, Alexander J', 'Edwards, Jason M', 'Mokelke, Eric A', 'Sturek, Michael']","['Lloyd PG', 'Sheehy AJ', 'Edwards JM', 'Mokelke EA', 'Sturek M']","['Department of Cellular and Integrative Physiology, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, Indiana 46202, USA.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Coron Artery Dis,Coronary artery disease,9011445,['0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Coronary Restenosis/*metabolism/pathology', 'Coronary Vessels/*metabolism', 'Hyperplasia/metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Muscle, Smooth, Vascular/metabolism', 'Organ Culture Techniques', 'Stents', 'Swine', 'Swine, Miniature', 'Tunica Intima/metabolism/pathology', 'Up-Regulation']",2008/05/16 09:00,2008/10/08 09:00,['2008/05/16 09:00'],"['2008/05/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/08 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/MCA.0b013e3282f9d3be [doi]', '00019501-200806000-00001 [pii]']",ppublish,Coron Artery Dis. 2008 Jun;19(4):217-26. doi: 10.1097/MCA.0b013e3282f9d3be.,4,,,"['R01 HL062552/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R24 RR013223/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'HL062552/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'RR013223/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We previously reported the cloning of the full-length cDNAs of 20 kDa regulatory myosin light chain (MLC-2), named as MLC-2A, from Meg-01, a human megakaryoblastic leukemia cell line (J. Smooth Muscle Res. 37: 25-38, 2001). We now cloned another MLC-2 isoforms from human platelets and U937, a human monocytic leukemia cell line, named as MLC-2B and MLC-2C, respectively. Both MLC-2A and MLC-2B consisted of three exons, which were situated on gene loci 18p1.3. Analysis of the gene structure indicated that MLC-2A and MLC-2B utilized different exons. MLC-2C also consisted of three exons, which was situated on gene loci 20p12. Amino acid sequence of MLC-2C was, of interest, apparently almost the same as that of MLC-2 from chicken gizzard smooth muscle LC20-A (one amino acid's difference) and human vascular smooth muscle LC-20 (two amino acids' difference). All three protein kinase C phosphorylation residues (Ser-1, Ser-2, Thr-9) and both myosin light chain kinase phosporylation residues (Thr-18, Ser-19) are conserved in these three isoforms. The MLC-2A and MLC-2B mRNA were expressed constitutively in all of the human hematopoietic cell lines examined and their expression levels were almost the same. On the other hand, MLC-2C mRNA was expressed in untreated monocytic cell lines (U937 and A-THP-1) and HL-60 differentiated into monocyte/macrophage cell lineage by TPA treatment. These results indicate that smooth muscle type isoform, MLC-2C is the inducible isoform, and might play a crucial role in monocyte/macrophage cell lineage.","['Higashihara, Masaaki', 'Watanabe, Mariko', 'Usuda, Shigeki', 'Miyazaki, Kouji']","['Higashihara M', 'Watanabe M', 'Usuda S', 'Miyazaki K']","['Department of Hematology, Internal Medicine, Kitasato University School of Medicine, Sagamihara-shi, Kanagawa 228-8555, Japan. mahigash@med.kitasato-u.ac.jp']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,J Smooth Muscle Res,Journal of smooth muscle research = Nihon Heikatsukin Gakkai kikanshi,9211664,"['0 (Myosin Light Chains)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (myosin light chain 2)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (Cardiac Myosins)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cardiac Myosins/analysis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chickens', 'Exons', 'Humans', 'Macrophages/cytology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Monocytes/cytology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Muscle, Smooth, Vascular/*metabolism', 'Myosin Light Chains/analysis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Isoforms/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism']",2008/05/16 09:00,2008/07/22 09:00,['2008/05/16 09:00'],"['2008/05/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/22 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['JST.JSTAGE/jsmr/44.29 [pii]', '10.1540/jsmr.44.29 [doi]']",ppublish,J Smooth Muscle Res. 2008 Feb;44(1):29-40. doi: 10.1540/jsmr.44.29.,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we have tested whether this motif is used for isomerization of the intersubunit disulfide of Env and whether this rearrangement is required for membrane fusion. We introduced the C225A and C228A mutations into Env and found that the former but not the latter mutant matured into covalently linked SU-TM complexes in transfected cells. Next, we constructed a secreted Env ectodomain and showed that it underwent incubation-dependent intersubunit disulfide isomerization on target cells. However, the rearrangement was blocked by the C225A mutation, suggesting that C(225) carried the isomerization-active thiol. Still, it was possible to reduce the intersubunit disulfide of the native C225A ectodomain mutant with dithiothreitol (DTT). The importance of the CXXC-mediated disulfide isomerization for infection was studied using murine leukemia virus vectors pseudotyped with wild-type or C225A HTLV-1 Env. We found that the mutant Env blocked infection, but this could be rescued with DTT. The fusion activity was tested in a fusion-from-within assay using a coculture of rat XC target and transfected BHK-21 effector cells. We found that the mutation blocked polykaryon formation, but this could be reversed with DTT. Similar DTT-reversible inhibition of infection and fusion was observed when a membrane-impermeable alkylator was present during the infection/fusion incubation. We conclude that the fusion activity of HTLV-1 Env is controlled by an SU CXXC-mediated isomerization of the intersubunit disulfide. Thus, this extends the applicability of the isomerization model from gammaretroviruses to deltaretroviruses.","['Li, Kejun', 'Zhang, Shujing', 'Kronqvist, Malin', 'Wallin, Michael', 'Ekstrom, Maria', 'Derse, David', 'Garoff, Henrik']","['Li K', 'Zhang S', 'Kronqvist M', 'Wallin M', 'Ekstrom M', 'Derse D', 'Garoff H']","['Department of Biosciences and Nutrition, Karolinska Institute, S-141 57 Huddinge, Sweden.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Disulfides)', '0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (Reducing Agents)', 'T8ID5YZU6Y (Dithiothreitol)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Substitution/genetics', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cricetinae', 'Disulfides/*metabolism', 'Dithiothreitol/pharmacology', 'Gene Products, env/genetics/*metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Mutation, Missense', 'Rats', 'Reducing Agents/pharmacology', '*Virus Internalization']",2008/05/16 09:00,2008/07/17 09:00,['2008/05/16 09:00'],"['2008/05/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['JVI.00448-08 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.00448-08 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2008 Jul;82(14):7135-43. doi: 10.1128/JVI.00448-08.

PML-NB disruption is recapitulated by a variety of DNA viruses that encode proteins responsible for compromising PML-NB integrity through different mechanisms. PML-NB disruption has been correlated with the antagonism of both innate and intrinsic immune responses. The E4 ORF3 protein is required for adenoviral DNA replication in the interferon (IFN)-induced antiviral state. This may reflect the fact that PML itself, in addition to several other PML-NB proteins, is encoded by an interferon-stimulated gene. Here, we demonstrate that reorganization of the PML-NB by E4 ORF3 antagonizes an innate antiviral response mediated by both PML and Daxx. Reduction of either of these proteins is sufficient to restore the replicative capacity of virus with the E4 ORF3 protein deleted in the IFN-induced antiviral state. Further, we provide evidence that both the HSV1 ICP0 and HCMV IE1 proteins, which disrupt PML-NBs by mechanistically distinct strategies, behave in a manner functionally analogous to E4 ORF3 with respect to antagonizing the IFN-induced antiviral state. In addition, we assert that this innate antiviral strategy mediated by PML and Daxx does not involve transcriptional repression. While early gene transcription is modestly diminished in the absence of E4 ORF3 protein expression, this reduction does not affect early protein function. We propose that, in addition to its ability to repress gene expression, the PML-NB participates in additional innate immune activities.","['Ullman, Amanda J', 'Hearing, Patrick']","['Ullman AJ', 'Hearing P']","['Department of Molecular Genetics and Microbiology, School of Medicine, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY 11794, USA.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Adenovirus E4 Proteins)', '0 (Co-Repressor Proteins)', '0 (DAXX protein, human)', '0 (Immediate-Early Proteins)', '0 (Molecular Chaperones)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Vmw110 protein, Human herpesvirus 1)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Adenoviridae/genetics/*immunology', 'Adenovirus E4 Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/virology', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Co-Repressor Proteins', 'Cytomegalovirus', 'Gene Deletion', 'Humans', 'Immediate-Early Proteins/metabolism', 'Interferon-gamma/immunology', 'Molecular Chaperones', 'Nuclear Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Transcription Factors/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/metabolism', 'Viral Proteins/metabolism', 'Virus Replication']",2008/05/16 09:00,2008/08/02 09:00,['2008/05/16 09:00'],"['2008/05/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/02 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['JVI.00723-08 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.00723-08 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2008 Aug;82(15):7325-35. doi: 10.1128/JVI.00723-08.

To study the dynamics of PML NBs during mitosis, we developed several U2OS cell lines stably coexpressing PML-enhanced cyan fluorescent protein with other individual marker proteins. Using three-dimensional time-lapse live cell imaging and four-dimensional particle tracking, we quantitatively demonstrated that PML NBs exhibit a high percentage of directed movement when cells progressed from prophase to prometaphase. The timing of this increased dynamic movement occurred just before or upon nuclear entry of cyclin B1, but before nuclear envelope breakdown. Our data suggest that entry into prophase leads to a loss of tethering between regions of chromatin and PML NBs, resulting in their increased dynamics. On exit from mitosis, Sp100 and Fas death domain-associated protein (Daxx) entered the daughter nuclei after a functional nuclear membrane was reformed. However, the recruitment of these proteins to PML NBs was delayed and correlated with the timing of de novo PML NB formation. Together, these results provide insight into the dynamic changes associated with PML NBs during mitosis.","['Chen, Yi-Chun M', 'Kappel, Constantin', 'Beaudouin, Joel', 'Eils, Roland', 'Spector, David L']","['Chen YC', 'Kappel C', 'Beaudouin J', 'Eils R', 'Spector DL']","['Molecular and Cellular Biology Program, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY 11794, USA.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Biol Cell,Molecular biology of the cell,9201390,"['0 (Antigens, Nuclear)', '0 (Autoantigens)', '0 (CCNB1 protein, human)', '0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Cyan Fluorescent Protein)', '0 (Cyclin B)', '0 (Cyclin B1)', '135844-47-2 (Sp100 protein, human)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)']",IM,"['Antigens, Nuclear/metabolism', 'Autoantigens/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Chromatin/chemistry', 'Cyclin B/metabolism', 'Cyclin B1', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Intranuclear Inclusion Bodies/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Metaphase', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence/methods', '*Mitosis', 'Prophase', 'Time Factors', 'Transcription, Genetic']",2008/05/16 09:00,2009/02/26 09:00,['2008/05/16 09:00'],"['2008/05/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/02/26 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['E08-01-0035 [pii]', '10.1091/mbc.e08-01-0035 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Biol Cell. 2008 Jul;19(7):3147-62. doi: 10.1091/mbc.e08-01-0035.

Gain-of-function mutations in several types of leukemia define Shp2 as a bona fide oncogene. We performed a high-throughput in silico screen for small-molecular-weight compounds that bind the catalytic site of Shp2. We have identified the phenylhydrazonopyrazolone sulfonate PHPS1 as a potent and cell-permeable inhibitor, which is specific for Shp2 over the closely related tyrosine phosphatases Shp1 and PTP1B. PHPS1 inhibits Shp2-dependent cellular events such as hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor (HGF/SF)-induced epithelial cell scattering and branching morphogenesis. PHPS1 also blocks Shp2-dependent downstream signaling, namely HGF/SF-induced sustained phosphorylation of the Erk1/2 MAP kinases and dephosphorylation of paxillin. Furthermore, PHPS1 efficiently inhibits activation of Erk1/2 by the leukemia-associated Shp2 mutant, Shp2-E76K, and blocks the anchorage-independent growth of a variety of human tumor cell lines. The PHPS compound class is therefore suitable for further development of therapeutics for the treatment of Shp2-dependent diseases.","['Hellmuth, Klaus', 'Grosskopf, Stefanie', 'Lum, Ching Tung', 'Wurtele, Martin', 'Roder, Nadine', 'von Kries, Jens Peter', 'Rosario, Marta', 'Rademann, Jorg', 'Birchmeier, Walter']","['Hellmuth K', 'Grosskopf S', 'Lum CT', 'Wurtele M', 'Roder N', 'von Kries JP', 'Rosario M', 'Rademann J', 'Birchmeier W']","['Max Delbruck Center for Molecular Medicine, Robert Rossle Strasse 10, D-13125 Berlin, Germany.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Benzenesulfonates)', '0 (Hydrazones)', '0 (Pyrazolones)', '0 (phenylhydrazonopyrazolone sulfonate 1)', '39455-90-8 (pyrazolone)', '67256-21-7 (Hepatocyte Growth Factor)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Benzenesulfonates/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Catalytic Domain', 'Dogs', '*Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Hepatocyte Growth Factor/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydrazones/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3/metabolism', 'Models, Biological', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11/metabolism/*physiology', 'Pyrazolones/chemistry', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",2008/05/16 09:00,2008/06/25 09:00,['2008/05/16 09:00'],"['2008/05/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/25 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['0710468105 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.0710468105 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2008 May 20;105(20):7275-80. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0710468105.

The frequency of leukemic bone marrow/median frequency of LAPs in normal or regenerating bone marrow samples using maximum log difference statistics revealed that CD2, CD56, CD11b, CD7, and CD19 expression on AML blasts represented the most sensitive and reliable markers for detection of MRD. Serial dilutional experiments showed that the sensitivity level of immunophenotyping was between 10-4 and 10-5 and that the approach was highly reproducible. Immunophenotypic analysis using a CD45 gating strategy, 5-color staining, and an extensive panel of monoclonal antibodies allowed the identification of LAPs in 94% of AML cases, and these immunophenotypes can be used for MRD monitoring with a sensitivity limit of 10-4 to 10-5.","['Al-Mawali, Adhra', 'Gillis, David', 'Hissaria, Pravin', 'Lewis, Ian']","['Al-Mawali A', 'Gillis D', 'Hissaria P', 'Lewis I']","['Division of Human Immunology, Hanson Institute, Institute of Medical and Veterinary Science, Adelaide, Australia.']",,['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Am J Clin Pathol,American journal of clinical pathology,0370470,"['0 (Antigens, CD)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD/immunology/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Cells/classification/pathology', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry/instrumentation/*methods', 'Humans', '*Immunophenotyping', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/immunology/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm, Residual/diagnosis', 'Phenotype', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Regeneration', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",2008/05/16 09:00,2008/07/02 09:00,['2008/05/16 09:00'],"['2008/05/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/02 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['030406XQ26673284 [pii]', '10.1309/FY0UMAMM91VPMR2W [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Clin Pathol. 2008 Jun;129(6):934-45. doi: 10.1309/FY0UMAMM91VPMR2W.,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PD-1 expression was recently reported in some T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) subtypes, but the expression profile of PD-1 and its ligands (PD-L1 and PD-L2) in B-NHLs remains largely to be characterized. To investigate this issue, monoclonal antibodies against PD-1, PD-L1, and PD-L2 were generated by immunization of balb-c mice. A series of 161 lymphoma tissue and 11 blood samples was analyzed using either immunohistochemistry or flow cytometry. In reactive lymph nodes, PD-1 was mainly expressed in follicular T cells. In B-NHLs, PD-1 was mainly expressed in reactive T cells; but expression was also noted in neoplastic B cells from small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL, 12/13), grade III follicular lymphoma (3/3), and diffuse large cell lymphoma (2/25). In contrast, neoplastic B cells from mantle cell lymphoma (0/11), marginal zone lymphoma (0/12), Burkitt lymphoma (0/3), and grade 1 to 2 follicular lymphoma (0/40) were PD-1 negative. PD-L1 and PD-L2 were negative in small B-cell lymphomas, including B-SLL. Flow cytometry showed that blood cells from chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) also displayed PD-1 expression, which could be increased by CD40 stimulation. PD-1 expression in T-NHLs was restricted to the angioimmunoblastic subtype (8/8). These results show that PD-1 expression among B-NHLs is mainly associated with SLL/CLL and is influenced by activation of the CD40/CD40L pathway. Because the anti-PD-1.6.4 antibody works on paraffin sections, it represents a useful tool to differentiate SLL/CLL from other small B-cell lymphomas.","['Xerri, Luc', 'Chetaille, Bruno', 'Serriari, Nacer', 'Attias, Coralie', 'Guillaume, Yves', 'Arnoulet, Christine', 'Olive, Daniel']","['Xerri L', 'Chetaille B', 'Serriari N', 'Attias C', 'Guillaume Y', 'Arnoulet C', 'Olive D']","['Department of Bio-pathology, Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Marseille 13009, France. xerril@marseille.fnclcc.fr']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Hum Pathol,Human pathology,9421547,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (PDCD1 protein, human)', '0 (Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD/*metabolism', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/*metabolism', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*metabolism', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Immunoblastic Lymphadenopathy/diagnosis/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/*metabolism', 'Lymph Nodes/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/diagnosis/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor']",2008/05/16 09:00,2008/07/09 09:00,['2008/05/16 09:00'],"['2007/07/06 00:00 [received]', '2007/11/13 00:00 [revised]', '2007/11/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/05/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/09 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0046-8177(07)00655-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.humpath.2007.11.012 [doi]']",ppublish,Hum Pathol. 2008 Jul;39(7):1050-8. doi: 10.1016/j.humpath.2007.11.012.

Using PICOT overexpressing rat basophilic leukemia cells (RBL-2H3), we evaluated the effect of PICOT overexpression on the FcepsilonRI-mediated signaling. In comparison to the control cells, introduction of PICOT to RBL-2H3 cells induced increased degranulation and the activation of NFAT and in the expression of IL-4 and TNF-alpha transcripts by FcepsilonRI-crosslinking, whereas no significant change was observed with the elevation of ERK1/2 and p38 MAP kinase phosphorylation and NF-kappaB activation by FcepsilonRI aggregation. More interesting was the exogenous PICOT overexpression in RBL-2H3 cells causing a large decrease in the elevation of JNK phosphorylation. PICOT-regulated FcepsilonRI-mediated signals in RBL-2H3 cells and acted as a positive regulator on IL-4 and TNF-alpha expression, NFAT and degranulation signal pathways and a negative regulator on a JNK signal pathway.

This study was to compare the reversal effects of BrTet and Tet on MDR of human leukemia cell line K562/A02. METHODS: The effects of BrTet on the proliferation of K562 and K562/A02 cells were observed by MTT assay. The inhibitory effects of adriamycin (ADM) used alone or in combination with BrTet or Tet on the proliferation of K562 and K562/A02 cells were evaluated by MTT assay. The effect of BrTet or Tet on ADM accumulation was analyzed by flow cytometry (FCM). The protein level of P-gp was detected by Western blot. RESULTS: The inhibition rates of low concentrations of BrTet (< or =2.0 micromol/L) and Tet (< or =1.5 micromol/L) on the proliferation of K562 and K562/A02 cells were below 10%; no significant cytotoxicity was observed. The resistance of K562/A02 cells to ADM was 49.51 folds of that of K562 cells. When added 1.0 micromol/L Tet, the chemosensitivity of K562/A02 cells to ADM was increased to 12.17 folds; when added 0.25, 0.5 and 1.0 micromol/L BrTet, the chemosensitivity of K562/A02 cells to ADM was increased to 17.88, 9.9 and 4.24 folds, respectively. FCM showed that 1.0 micromol/L BrTet inhibited the overexpression of P-gp and increased the accumulation of ADM in K562/A02 cells, and its potency was greater than that of 1.0 micromol/L Tet(P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: BrTet could reverse MDR in vitro. Its activity may be related to the inhibition of P-gp overexpression and the increase in intracellular accumulation of anticancer drugs.","['Wang, Jue-Qiong', 'Chen, Bao-An', 'Cheng, Jian', 'Xu, Wen-Lin', 'Sun, Xin-Chen']","['Wang JQ', 'Chen BA', 'Cheng J', 'Xu WL', 'Sun XC']","[""Department of Hematology, Zhongda Hospital, Southeast University, Nanjing,Jiangsu, 210009, People's Republic of China.""]",,['chi'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Ai Zheng,Ai zheng = Aizheng = Chinese journal of cancer,9424852,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Benzylisoquinolines)', '0 (bromotetrandrine)', '29EX23D5AJ (tetrandrine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*metabolism', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/pharmacology', 'Benzylisoquinolines/*pharmacology', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells']",2008/05/16 09:00,2010/04/28 06:00,['2008/05/16 09:00'],"['2008/05/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/28 06:00 [medline]', '2008/05/16 09:00 [entrez]']",['1000-467X200805491 [pii]'],ppublish,Ai Zheng. 2008 May;27(5):491-5.,5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: 120 patients diagnosed as CML with positive Ph chromosome were treated with IM 400 mg/d for CML in chronic phase (CP) (n = 90) or 600 mg/d for CML in accelerated or blastic phase (AP or BP) (n = 30) once daily. Hematological, cytogenetic and molecular effects of IM on the disease process of these patients were evaluated with blood and marrow cells morphology examination, G-band conventional cytogenetics analysis for Ph chromosome and PCR assay for BCR/ABL gene. The treatment efficacy and safety were retrospectively studied. RESULTS: (1) In CML-CP patients, after a follow-up of 9 ( range 3-42) months, cumulative complete hematological response (CHR), complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) and complete molecular response (CMR) rates were 73.3%, 66.7% and 54.4%, which was not influenced by prior treatment of interferon. CMR was better when time from diagnosis to treatment with IM was < or = 6 months (P < 0.05). The effect was not related with sex or age (P < 0.05). It is significant that the time to first CHR and time to first CCyR were related with the time to first CCyR and the time to first negative BCR/ ABL, respectively (both P < 0.05), while there was no relation between the time to first CHR and the time to first negative BCR/ABL (P > 0.05). (2) CHR, CCyR and CMR rates of the patients with progressive course (AP and BP) were 43.3%, 25.9% and 25.0%, respectively. The total mortality rate was 30.0%. (3) The mortality rate of the patients with age < or = 25 was higher than those >25 (P < 0.05). (4) Grade 3 leukocytopenia occurred in 16.0% of the patients and grade 3 thrombocytopenia in 18.0% of the patients and they 12 (5-20) weeks and 9 (3-16) weeks after the treatment, respectively.

However, the absolute number of irradiated children is estimated to be quite low. The aim of this study was to evaluate the availability and application of pediatric radiation oncology in Germany. METHOD: In summer 2007, a standardized questionnaire was sent to all radiotherapy facilities in Germany. The questions regarded the structure of the departments, the number of irradiated children each year including the distribution of the different diagnoses, the number of curative treatments, inclusion in study trials, and existence of special contact persons for pediatric radiotherapy as well as technical aspects of irradiation of children. RESULTS: Answers to the questionnaires were obtained from 171 departments (77.4%). Of these, 67 (39%) stated to regularly treat children. These departments treated one to nine children in median each year (<5 children/year: 23 departments; >or=20 children: 15 departments). Most of these children suffered from brain tumors, Hodgkin's disease and acute lymphatic leukemia (ALL). Three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy was the most frequent treatment technique; special techniques like intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) or brachytherapy were rare. CONCLUSIONS: Due to quite low patient numbers treated in most radiotherapy facilities, individual experiences in pediatric radiation oncology can be assumed to be quite limited. As radiotherapy is part of multimodal therapy approaches in pediatric oncology and children treated with radiotherapy are at special risk for potential side effects, pediatric radiation oncology remains a sophisticated area. Therefore radiotherapy reference-institutions implemented by the therapy optimizing protocols are of fundamental importance.","['Bolling, T', 'Ernst, I', 'Konemann, S', 'Willich, N']","['Bolling T', 'Ernst I', 'Konemann S', 'Willich N']","['Department of Radiotherapy, University Hospital of Munster, Germany.

The important role of Se in antioxidative biological pathways is proven. Many parents of children with malignancies ask for supplementation with Se as part of complementary therapy during or after the oncological treatment. However, toxic Se concentrations may easily be reached in children. In order to analyse whether Se is also supplied by red cell transfusions (RCT), we determined Se concentration in whole blood prior and after packed RCT in pediatric patients with hemato-oncological diseases. PATIENTS AND METHODS: EDTA-blood was collected from 17 patients (median age: 4 years, range: 1 month - 17 years) with aplastic anemia, acute leukemia and solid tumours prior and after RCT (n=60). Patients received a median of 2 transfusions (range: 1-14). Samples were also collected from the transfusion blood bags and Se concentration was determined quantitatively by atomic absorption spectrometry. RESULTS: 95% of the specimen collected from the transfusion bags exhibited selenium concentrations within the normal adult range. Mean Se concentration in the patients' blood prior to RCT was 66.2 microg/l (range: 38.0-166.4 microg/l) and increased to 70.7 microg/l (range: 14.1-105.1 microg/l) thereafter (statistically not significant). Applying age dependant reference values Se concentrations were below the lower limit in 45% of the samples prior to RCT and only in 26% after RCT. The reason for this increase was the fact that Se concentrations were often just marginally below the age-dependant lower limit prior to RCT and in the lower normal range thereafter. CONCLUSION: 43% of the patients with hemato-oncological diseases in this study exhibited no Se deficiency at any time point. In the remaining 57% of the patients a transient or persistent Se deficiency was detected with blood levels partially far below the lower threshold of the age adjusted normal range. The Se deficiency was corrected in four out of eight patients by RCT. As Se levels may fluctuate in individual pts a supplementation should only be initiated if based on regular monitoring of the Se concentration.","['Mackenroth, J', 'Holig, K', 'Kuhlisch, E', 'Siegert, G', 'Suttorp, M']","['Mackenroth J', 'Holig K', 'Kuhlisch E', 'Siegert G', 'Suttorp M']","['Klinik und Poliklinik fur Kinder- und Jugendmedizin, Universitatsklinikum Carl Gustav Carus, Technische Universitat Dresden, Dresden.']",,['ger'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Klin Padiatr,Klinische Padiatrie,0326144,['H6241UJ22B (Selenium)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Anemia, Aplastic/blood/*therapy', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Erythrocyte Transfusion', 'Erythrocytes/metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/blood/*therapy', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/blood/*therapy', 'Reference Values', 'Selenium/*blood']",2008/05/15 09:00,2008/07/30 09:00,['2008/05/15 09:00'],"['2008/05/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/30 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/15 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1055/s-2008-1065344 [doi]'],ppublish,Klin Padiatr. 2008 May-Jun;220(3):153-8. doi: 10.1055/s-2008-1065344.,3,,,,,,,,Einfluss der Transfusion von Erythrozytenkonzentrat auf die Selenkonzentration im Vollblut bei Kindern mit hamato-onkologischen Erkrankungen.,,,,,,,,,,,

Genetic variation at >500,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) was also assessed. The expression of only 176/11,783 (1.5%) genes was correlated (p<0.008, FDR = 25%) in the two tissue types, but expression of a high proportion (20 of these 176 genes) was significantly related to cis-SNP genotypes (adjusted p<0.05). In an independent set of 134 patients with ALL, 14 of these 20 genes were validated as having expression related to cis-SNPs, as were 9 of 20 genes in a second validation set of HapMap cell lines.

The current challenge in gene selection is the comparison of a large number of genes with limited patient samples. Thus it is trivial task in simple statistical analysis. Various statistical measurements are adopted by filter methods applied in gene selection studies. Their ability to discriminate phenotypes is crucial in classification and selection. Here we describe the standard deviation error distribution (SDED) method for gene selection. It utilizes variations within-class and among-class in gene expression data.

The Prediction accuracies by SDED are better than both GS2 and CHO for different datasets. These are 0.8-4.2% and 1.6-8.4% more that in GS2 and CHO.

A quantitative expression profile analysis of 157 mature miRNAs was performed on 100 AML patients representing the spectrum of known karyotypes common in AML. The principle observation reported here is that AMLs bearing a t(15;17) translocation had a distinctive signature throughout the whole set of genes, including the up regulation of a subset of miRNAs located in the human 14q32 imprinted domain. The set included miR-127, miR-154, miR-154*, miR-299, miR-323, miR-368, and miR-370. Furthermore, specific subsets of miRNAs were identified that provided molecular signatures characteristic of the major translocation-mediated gene fusion events in AML. Analysis of variance showed the significant deregulation of 33 miRNAs across the leukaemic set with respect to bone marrow from healthy donors. Fluorescent in situ hybridisation analysis using miRNA-specific locked nucleic acid (LNA) probes on cryopreserved patient cells confirmed the results obtained by real-time PCR. This study, conducted on about a fifth of the miRNAs currently reported in the Sanger database (microrna.sanger.ac.uk), demonstrates the potential for using miRNA expression to sub-classify cancer and suggests a role in the aetiology of leukaemia.","['Dixon-McIver, Amanda', 'East, Phil', 'Mein, Charles A', 'Cazier, Jean-Baptiste', 'Molloy, Gael', 'Chaplin, Tracy', 'Andrew Lister, T', 'Young, Bryan D', 'Debernardi, Silvana']","['Dixon-McIver A', 'East P', 'Mein CA', 'Cazier JB', 'Molloy G', 'Chaplin T', 'Andrew Lister T', 'Young BD', 'Debernardi S']","['Institute of Cancer, Medical Oncology Centre, Barts and The London, School Of Medicine, London, United Kingdom.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Validation Study']",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Oligonucleotides)', '0 (locked nucleic acid)']",IM,"['Analysis of Variance', 'Base Sequence', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14', 'DNA Probes', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Oligonucleotides/chemistry', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2008/05/15 09:00,2008/08/20 09:00,['2008/05/15 09:00'],"['2008/01/24 00:00 [received]', '2008/03/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/05/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/20 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/15 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1371/journal.pone.0002141 [doi]'],epublish,PLoS One. 2008 May 14;3(5):e2141. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0002141.,5,,,"['A6438/CRUK_/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom', 'A6789/CRUK_/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom', 'C6277/A6789/CRUK_/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom']",20080514,PMC2373886,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Leukemic LGLs correspond to terminally differentiated effector-memory cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) that escape Fas-mediated activation-induced cell death (AICD) in vivo. The gene expression signature of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 30 LGL leukemia patients showed profound dysregulation of expression of apoptotic genes and suggested uncoupling of activation and apoptotic pathways as a mechanism for failure of AICD in leukemic LGLs. Pathway-based microarray analysis indicated that balance of proapoptotic and antiapoptotic sphingolipid-mediated signaling was deregulated in leukemic LGLs. We further investigated sphingolipid pathways and found that acid ceramidase was constitutively overexpressed in leukemic LGLs and that its inhibition induced apoptosis of leukemic LGLs. We also showed that S1P(5) is the predominant S1P receptor in leukemic LGLs, whereas S1P(1) is down-regulated. FTY720, a functional antagonist of S1P-mediated signaling, induced apoptosis in leukemic LGLs and also sensitized leukemic LGLs to Fas-mediated death. Collectively, these results show a role for sphingolipid-mediated signaling as a mechanism for long-term survival of CTLs. Therapeutic targeting of this pathway, such as use of FTY720, may have efficacy in LGL leukemia.","['Shah, Mithun Vinod', 'Zhang, Ranran', 'Irby, Rosalyn', 'Kothapalli, Ravi', 'Liu, Xin', 'Arrington, Ty', 'Frank, Bryan', 'Lee, Norman H', 'Loughran, Thomas P Jr']","['Shah MV', 'Zhang R', 'Irby R', 'Kothapalli R', 'Liu X', 'Arrington T', 'Frank B', 'Lee NH', 'Loughran TP Jr']","['Penn State Hershey Cancer Institute, Milton S.

Imatinib and dasa-tinib (a dual-specific SRC/BCR-ABL kinase inhibitor) were compared in a preclinical mouse model of intracranial Ph(+) leukemia. Clinical dasatinib treatment in patients with CNS Ph(+) leukemia was assessed. In preclinical studies, dasatinib increased survival, whereas imatinib failed to inhibit intracranial tumor growth. Stabilization and regression of CNS disease were achieved with continued dasa-tinib administration. The drug also demonstrated substantial activity in 11 adult and pediatric patients with CNS Ph(+) leukemia. Eleven evaluable patients had clinically significant, long-lasting responses, which were complete in 7 patients. In 3 additional patients, isolated CNS relapse occurred during dasatinib therapy; and in 2 of them, it was caused by expansion of a BCR-ABL-mutated dasatinib-resistant clone, implying selection pressure exerted by the compound in the CNS. Dasatinib has promising therapeutic potential in managing intracranial leukemic disease and substantial clinical activity in patients who experience CNS relapse while on imatinib therapy.

The aim of the study was to assess the feasibility of modification of retroviral vectors by exogenous addition of recombinant protein, removing the need for genetic engineering of virus producer cell lines. The recombinant GPI protein CD59his was purified via fast protein liquid chromatography and associated with concentrated virus stock in a controlled incubation procedure. Reaction mixtures were purified in order to remove nonassociated GPI protein and endogenous protein. Analysis of samples by immunoblotting revealed that CD59his was only detectable in the presence of viral particles. From this, we conclude that CD59his could be stably associated with retroviral particles. In addition, we demonstrated by flow cytometry that virus particles remain infectious after these procedures. As well as suggesting a novel possibility for interaction between enveloped virus and host, we believe that the stable association of recombinant GPI proteins to retroviral particles can be developed into an important tool for both research and clinical applications, especially in the fields of gene therapy and vaccine development.","['Metzner, Christoph', 'Mostegl, Meike M', 'Gunzburg, Walter H', 'Salmons, Brian', 'Dangerfield, John A']","['Metzner C', 'Mostegl MM', 'Gunzburg WH', 'Salmons B', 'Dangerfield JA']","['Institute of Virology, University of Veterinary Medicine, Veterinarplatz 1, A-1210 Vienna, Austria. christoph.metzner@vu-wien.ac.at']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,FASEB J,FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology,8804484,"['0 (CD59 Antigens)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Glycosylphosphatidylinositols)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '101754-01-2 (CD59 protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'CD59 Antigens/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'Glycosylphosphatidylinositols/*metabolism', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Lentivirus/metabolism', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Recombinant Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Retroviridae/*metabolism', 'Virion/metabolism', 'Virology/methods']",2008/05/15 09:00,2008/09/04 09:00,['2008/05/15 09:00'],"['2008/05/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/04 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['fj.08-108217 [pii]', '10.1096/fj.08-108217 [doi]']",ppublish,FASEB J. 2008 Aug;22(8):2734-9. doi: 10.1096/fj.08-108217.

C/EBPdelta is regulated at the transcriptional, post-transcriptional, and post-translational levels, suggesting tight control of C/EBPdelta content and function. Protein inhibitors of activated STATs (PIASs) regulate a growing number of transcription factors, including C/EBPs. HC11 nontransformed mammary epithelial cells express PIAS3, PIASxbeta, and PIASy, and all three PIAS family members repress C/EBPdelta transcriptional activity. PIASy is the most potent, however, repressing C/EBPdelta transcriptional activity by >80%. PIASy repression of C/EBPdelta transcriptional activity is dependent upon interaction between the highly conserved PIASy N-terminal nuclear matrix binding domain (SAPD) and the C/EBPdelta transactivation domain (TAD). PIASy repression of C/EBPdelta transcriptional activity is independent of histone deacetylase activity, PIASy E3 SUMO ligase activity, and C/EBPdelta sumoylation status. PIASy expression is associated with C/EBPdelta translocation from nuclear foci, where C/EBPdelta co-localizes with p300, to the nuclear periphery. PIASy-mediated translocation of C/EBPdelta is dependent upon the PIASy SAPD and C/EBPdelta TAD. PIASy reduces the expression of C/EBPdelta adhesion-related target genes and enhances repopulation of open areas within a cell monolayer in the in vitro ""scratch"" assay. These results demonstrate that PIASy represses C/EBPdelta by a mechanism that requires interaction between the PIASy SAPD and C/EBPdelta TAD and does not require PIASy SUMO ligase activity or C/EBPdelta sumoylation. PIASy alters C/EBPdelta nuclear localization, reduces C/EBPdelta transcriptional activity, and enhances cell proliferation/migration.","['Zhou, Shanggen', 'Si, Junling', 'Liu, Tong', 'DeWille, James W']","['Zhou S', 'Si J', 'Liu T', 'DeWille JW']","['Ohio State Biochemistry Program, Department of Veterinary Biosciences, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Protein Inhibitors of Activated STAT)', '0 (SUMO-1 Protein)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '142662-43-9 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-delta)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-delta/*metabolism', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Movement', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Mice', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Inhibitors of Activated STAT/classification/*metabolism', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'SUMO-1 Protein/metabolism', 'Trans-Activators/*genetics']",2008/05/15 09:00,2008/09/04 09:00,['2008/05/15 09:00'],"['2008/05/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/04 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(20)59669-5 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M801307200 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2008 Jul 18;283(29):20137-48. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M801307200.

Subsequent investigation demonstrated the acute development of tumour lysis syndrome in the setting of a new onset, undiagnosed acute leukaemia. The patient died on the third postoperative day.

However, this type of ATLL with skin manifestations had a worse prognosis than that without skin lesions. This study aimed to define and distinguish cutaneous ATLL lacking nodal lymphoma and leukemic change from smoldering ATLL. We propose an entity of cutaneous ATLL, which has less than 5% abnormal T lymphocyte in peripheral blood, a normal lymphocyte count (i.e. <4 x 10(9)/L), no hypercalcemia and lactate dehydrogenase values of up to 1.5 times the normal upper limit. At least one of the histologically proven skin lesions should be present accompanying monoclonal integration of human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) proviral DNA in the skin lesion. Blood samples were collected from 41 HTLV-1-infected patients, 21 asymptomatic carriers, 16 patients with cutaneous ATLL and four patients with smoldering ATLL. HTLV-1 proviral loads, soluble interleukin-2 receptors and other parameters were examined in each case. HTLV-1 proviral DNA loads in smoldering ATLL group are significantly higher than those in asymptomatic carrier and cutaneous ATLL group. Cutaneous ATLL may be a distinct entity that should be separated from smoldering ATLL clinically and virologically.","['Amano, Masahiro', 'Kurokawa, Motoki', 'Ogata, Katsumi', 'Itoh, Hiroshi', 'Kataoka, Hiroaki', 'Setoyama, Mitsuru']","['Amano M', 'Kurokawa M', 'Ogata K', 'Itoh H', 'Kataoka H', 'Setoyama M']","['Department of Dermatology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki, Kiyotake, Miyazaki, Japan.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Dermatol,The Journal of dermatology,7600545,"['0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'DNA, Viral/*analysis', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/classification/*diagnosis', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell, Cutaneous/classification/*diagnosis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Proviruses/genetics', 'Viral Load']",2008/05/15 09:00,2008/09/05 09:00,['2008/05/15 09:00'],"['2008/05/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/05 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['JDE465 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1346-8138.2008.00465.x [doi]']",ppublish,J Dermatol. 2008 May;35(5):270-5. doi: 10.1111/j.1346-8138.2008.00465.x.,5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of the present paper was to examine p53 mutation and immunostaining of the same patients, because there have been few reports of simultaneous analysis of these markers. Seven p53 mutations were observed among 37 MDS and 11 cases of overt leukemia transformed from MDS (MDS-OL). Mutated p53 mainly observed in high-risk MDS had more intense p53 staining than in MDS with wild-type p53 overexpression. Aplastic anemia (AA) produced no p53 staining. The percentage of p53 staining in MDS (71%) was higher than that of mutated p53 (11%) but did not reach 100% of MDS cases studied, therefore the authors attempted to differentiate MDS, especially refractory anemia (RA) and AA, using a combination of p53 immunostaining, hemoglobin F (HbF) immunostaining and chromosome abnormality, because HbF of erythroblasts was reportedly observed in MDS RA but not in AA. Most MDS/MDS-OL (47/48) had at least one positive marker. Among 11 AA cases, only two were positive for HbF. The present results suggest that the combination of these three markers is useful to discriminate MDS from AA.","['Iwasaki, Takashi', 'Murakami, Masashi', 'Sugisaki, Chiho', 'Sobue, Sayaka', 'Ohashi, Haruhiko', 'Asano, Haruhiko', 'Suzuki, Motoshi', 'Nakamura, Shigeo', 'Ito, Masafumi', 'Murate, Takashi']","['Iwasaki T', 'Murakami M', 'Sugisaki C', 'Sobue S', 'Ohashi H', 'Asano H', 'Suzuki M', 'Nakamura S', 'Ito M', 'Murate T']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Nagoya University School of Medicine, Nagoya University School of Health Sciences, Nagoya, Japan.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Australia,Pathol Int,Pathology international,9431380,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '9034-63-3 (Fetal Hemoglobin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Anemia, Aplastic/*diagnosis/genetics/metabolism', 'Anemia, Refractory/*diagnosis/genetics/metabolism', 'Biomarkers/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'DNA, Neoplasm', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Fetal Hemoglobin/*metabolism', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique, Indirect', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*diagnosis/genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/*metabolism']",2008/05/15 09:00,2008/05/30 09:00,['2008/05/15 09:00'],"['2008/05/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/30 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['PIN2236 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1440-1827.2008.02236.x [doi]']",ppublish,Pathol Int. 2008 Jun;58(6):353-60. doi: 10.1111/j.1440-1827.2008.02236.x.,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report the clinical, morphological, immunophenotypic, cytogenetic and molecular genetic features of eight CLL cases with MYC rearrangement. The patients, five men and three women (median age, 71 years) had bone marrow involvement and an absolute peripheral blood lymphocytosis; five had lymphadenopathy; seven had splenomegaly. Prolymphocytes were increased (>/=10%) in all cases. Six cases were classified as CLL with increased prolymphocytes (CLL/PL; prolymphocytes 10-55%), and two were classified as CLL in prolymphocytic transformation (CLL/PT; prolymphocytes >55%). All cases co-expressed CD5, CD19, and CD23; five of eight expressed ZAP-70. Of seven cases tested, four had mutated and three had unmutated IGHV genes.

Seven cases contained additional chromosomal abnormalities. All patients received combination chemotherapy. Two developed Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCL) that were clonally unrelated to the CLL. At follow-up, two patients are alive, four died of underlying disease, one died of EBV-associated DLBCL, and one died of an unrelated cancer. In summary, MYC rearrangement, which occurs rarely in CLL patients, is associated with increased prolymphocytes, complex cytogenetic abnormalities, and a poor prognosis.","['Huh, Yang O', 'Lin, Katherine I-Chun', 'Vega, Francisco', 'Schlette, Ellen', 'Yin, C Cameron', 'Keating, Michael J', 'Luthra, R', 'Medeiros, L Jeffrey', 'Abruzzo, Lynne V']","['Huh YO', 'Lin KI', 'Vega F', 'Schlette E', 'Yin CC', 'Keating MJ', 'Luthra R', 'Medeiros LJ', 'Abruzzo LV']","['Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA. yhuh@mdanderson.org']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,IM,"['Aged', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics/pathology', 'Female', 'Genes, myc/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/pathology', 'Lymphoid Progenitor Cells/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Translocation, Genetic/*genetics']",2008/05/15 09:00,2008/12/17 09:00,['2008/05/15 09:00'],"['2008/05/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['BJH7152 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2008.07152.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2008 Jul;142(1):36-44. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2008.07152.x.

Descriptive techniques (age-adjusted incidence trends, age-specific incidence rates (IR), and age distributions-at-diagnosis) were supplemented with mathematical models (two-component mixture, generalized linear regression, and age-period-cohort). There were 2856 cases of HCL diagnosed during 1978-2004 (IR 0.32/100,000 person-years). IRs were nearly 4-fold greater among men than women and more than 3-fold higher for Whites than Blacks. Temporal trends were stable over time. Age-specific IRs increased rapidly until approximately 40 years then rose at a slower pace. The age-specific IR curves reflected bimodal early- and late-onset age distributions-at-diagnosis (or density plots), with some variation by gender. Among both men and women, a two-component mixture model fitted the data better than a single density or cancer population. Age-period-cohort models confirmed statistically significant age-related effects after full adjustment for temporal trends (calendar-period and birth-cohort effects). In summary, age incidence patterns (rates and bimodal densities) suggested that HCL is a heterogeneous disease, consisting of at least two underlying subgroups and/or cancer populations by age-at-onset. Distinct early- and late-onset HCL populations may reflect different age-related causal pathways, risk factor profiles, and/or stem cells of origin.","['Dores, Graca M', 'Matsuno, Rayna K', 'Weisenburger, Dennis D', 'Rosenberg, Philip S', 'Anderson, William F']","['Dores GM', 'Matsuno RK', 'Weisenburger DD', 'Rosenberg PS', 'Anderson WF']","['Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Oklahoma City, OK 73104, USA. doresg@mail.nih.gov']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Distribution', 'Age of Onset', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Registries', 'Sex Distribution', 'United States/epidemiology', 'Young Adult']",2008/05/15 09:00,2008/12/17 09:00,['2008/05/15 09:00'],"['2008/05/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['BJH7156 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2008.07156.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2008 Jul;142(1):45-51. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2008.07156.x.

However, some cancer cells express resistance to recombinant soluble TRAIL. To overcome this problem, we used a TRAIL adenovirus (Ad5/35-TRAIL) to induce apoptosis in a drug-sensitive and multidrug-resistant variant of HL-60 leukemia cells and determined the molecular mechanisms of Ad5/35-TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Ad5/35-TRAIL did not induce apoptosis in normal human lymphocytes, but caused massive apoptosis in acute myelocytic leukemia cells. It triggered more efficient apoptosis in drug-resistant HL-60/Vinc cells than in HL-60 cells. Treating the cells with anti-DR4 and anti-DR5 neutralizing antibodies (particularly anti-DR5) reduced, whereas anti-DcR1 antibody enhanced, the apoptosis triggered by Ad5/35-TRAIL. Whereas Ad5/35-TRAIL induced apoptosis in both cell lines through activation of caspase-3 and caspase-10, known to link the cell death receptor pathway to the mitochondrial pathway, it triggered increased mitochondrial membrane potential change (m) only in HL-60/Vinc cells. Ad5/35-TRAIL also increased the production of reactive oxygen species, which play an important role in apoptosis. Therefore, using Ad5/35-TRAIL may be an effective therapeutic strategy for eliminating TRAIL-resistant malignant cells and these studies may provide clues to treat and eradicate acute myelocytic leukemias.","['Wu, Ching-Huang', 'Kao, Ching-Hai', 'Safa, Ahmad R']","['Wu CH', 'Kao CH', 'Safa AR']","['Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN 46202, USA.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Hum Gene Ther,Human gene therapy,9008950,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (TNFRSF21 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adenoviridae/*genetics/metabolism/pathogenicity', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', '*Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'HL-60 Cells/drug effects/*virology', 'Humans', 'Lymphocytes/drug effects/metabolism/virology', 'Membrane Potentials', 'Mitochondria/physiology', 'Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/genetics/*pharmacology', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/*metabolism', '*Recombination, Genetic']",2008/05/15 09:00,2008/09/18 09:00,['2008/05/15 09:00'],"['2008/05/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/18 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1089/hum.2008.001 [doi]', '10.1089/hgt.2008.001 [pii]']",ppublish,Hum Gene Ther. 2008 Jul;19(7):731-43. doi: 10.1089/hum.2008.001.,7,,,"['R01 CA074042-11/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 90878/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 101743/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC2733364,['NIHMS123468'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The B7-H1 mRNA expression levels of BMMNCs from 74 newly diagnosed leukemia patients and 10 normal volunteers were detected by real-time quantitative PCR. At the same time, BMMNCs from 12 patients in complete remission (CR) after chemotherapy and 5 in relapse were followed up. The correlation between the clinical features of 74 de novo leukemia patients and the expression level of B7-H1 gene was analyzed. RESULTS: The mRNA expression level of B7-H1 gene in BMMNCs from de novo leukemia patients (RQ = 0.125) was lower than that from normal control (RQ=1). When patients achieved CR the gene expression level (RQ = 69.07) was significantly higher than that before CR (P = 0.001). After relapsed, its level (RQ=4) was still higher than that before CR (P > 0.05).

Then a CpG oligonucleotide CpG2006, two synthetic bacterial phosphodiester oligonucleotides A-ODN and T-ODN were added to these leukemia-derived DCs. Three days later, the DCs were re-detected by the above-mentioned methods. RESULTS: After induced by CpG2006, A-ODN or T-ODN, the leukemia-derived DCs with typical dendritic morphology were increased. The expressions of CD83, HLA-DR and CD86 were (65.5 +/- 8.4)%, (32.0 +/- 4.3)% and (18.6 +/- 3.2)% respectively in day 7 leukemia-derived DCs, raised to (88.9 +/- 3.6)%, (53.9 +/- 3.2)% and (39.9 +/- 7.3)% respectively after exposing CpG2006 for 3 days; increased to (97.0 +/- 5.3)%, (63.9 +/- 7.3)% and (40.2 +/- 7.4)% respectively after treated by A-ODN; and further increased to (93.26 +/- 4.65)%, (58.3 +/- 5.6)% and (36.2 +/- 6.8)% respectively after treated by T-ODN. These results was markedly different than unaffected cells did. These DCs induced by the above-mentioned three oligonucleotides could upregulate significantly the capacity for stimulating allogeneic T cells.

METHODS: Human myeloid leukemia cells of the line U937 were cultured and treated with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), DAC, and VPA. 72 h later cell differentiation test, cloning formation test, and chromatin immunoprecipitation test were performed. Bone marrow specimens were collected from 56 patients with acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) were cultured and treated with and 10 bone marrow specimens were used as controls. Methylation of RARbeta promoter was detected with methylation specific polymerase chain reaction (MSP) after bisulfite treatment. Relative levels of RARbeta mRNA were assessed with real time quantitative PCR assay. Flow cytometry assay was used to detect the myeloid differentiation marker CD11b in U937 cells. Chromatin immuno-precipitation assay (ChIP) was used to analyze the acetylated histone 3 bound to the retinoic acid response element (RARE) at the promoter region of RARbeta. RESULTS: Methylation of RARbeta was positive in 36 of the 56 (64.3%) AML patients and the U937 myeloid leukemia cells, however, was negative in the marrow mononuclear cells from the 10 healthy donors. The expression of RARbeta in U937 cells was up-regulated after treatment with ATRA (1 micromol/L) plus DAC (1 micromol/L) or VPA (0.5 mmol/L) for 72 hours, especially when the three drugs were used together. ChIP assay showed that the acetylated histone 3 bound to the RARE promoter region was increased after the cells were exposed to ATRA plus DAC/VPA. The data indicated that the reactivated expression of RARbeta might be secondary to the drug-induced histone acetylation as well as DNA demethylation. Treatment of U937 cells with ATRA and DAC/VPA also resulted in increased myeloid differentiation (CD11b expression) and decreased plating efficiency. CONCLUSION: The repressed expression of RARbeta in myeloid leukemia cells is closely related to both DNA hypermethylation and histone deacetylation, and a combination of ATRA with epigenetic modulators can be beneficial in the treatment of myeloid malignancies.","['Meng, Yue-sheng', 'Ma, Xiao-xia', 'Meng, Xiu-qin', 'Wei, Rong', 'Liu, Wei', 'Ai, Gong-wen', 'Zhang, Yan-xiang']","['Meng YS', 'Ma XX', 'Meng XQ', 'Wei R', 'Liu W', 'Ai GW', 'Zhang YX']","['Department of Hematology, Shanghai Tenth Peoples Hospital, Tongji University, Shanghai 200072, China. mengysm@yahoo.com']",,['chi'],['Journal Article'],China,Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua yi xue za zhi,7511141,"['0 (Histones)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (retinoic acid receptor beta)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '614OI1Z5WI (Valproic Acid)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Acetylation/drug effects', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Azacitidine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'CpG Islands/genetics', 'DNA Methylation', 'Decitabine', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/*genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'U937 Cells', 'Valproic Acid/pharmacology']",2008/05/15 09:00,2008/08/30 09:00,['2008/05/15 09:00'],"['2008/05/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/30 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/15 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi. 2007 Dec 25;87(48):3406-10.,48,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MTT and colony-forming assays were used to evaluate the efficacy of CDA-2 treatment for cell growth in K562 and K562R cell lines, and IM-resistant or non-IM-resistant bone marrow cells of the CML patients; Annexin-V staining was employed to detect the apoptosis. Cell differentiation was assessed by flow cytometry analysis with CD11b/CD14 markers, reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) for mRNA levels of NCF-1 and ORM-1 genes and Giemsa staining for the observation in morphology. Cell cycle distribution was detected by stained with propidium iodide and then analyzed by flow cytometer. RT-PCR also was employed for the expression of DNA methyltransferase. RESULTS: Significant cell growth inhibition was found at a dose-dependent manner in the IM-resistant K562R cell line and IM-resistant bone marrow cells of the CML patients compared with the non-resistant K562 cell line and bone marrow cells of the CML patients following 7 days exposure to CDA-2. Although CDA-2 could significantly induce the apoptosis of K562R (15.38%) compared with K562 (5.28%) (P < 0.05), the major reason for the cell growth inhibition of K562R is CDA-2-induced cell differentiation, including the increase of expression of differentiation-related antigens CD11b/CD14, mRNA expression of NCF-1 and ORM-1, and cell cycle arrest in G1-phase at a dose-dependent manner. Because CDA-2 could significantly activate the p21 and p27 gene expression, downregulate the expression of cyclin D1, and down-regulate the expressions of DNMT1 and DNMT(3B) at mRNA level, CDA-2 might be a DNMT inhibitor for restoring some gene function that involved in cell cycle control by demethylation. CONCLUSION: Inhibiting the growth and inducing the differentiation of K562R cells, CDA-2 is very likely to be a potential agent for the treatment of IM resistance CML patients.","['Wang, Xiao-dan', 'Qiu, Lin', 'Lu, Run-zhang', 'Chen, Li-jun', 'Zhan, Zhao-min', 'Han, Bing-hong', 'Zhang, Bo-long', 'Ma, Jun']","['Wang XD', 'Qiu L', 'Lu RZ', 'Chen LJ', 'Zhan ZM', 'Han BH', 'Zhang BL', 'Ma J']","['Institute of Hematology & Oncology, Harbin 150010, China.']",,['chi'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua yi xue za zhi,7511141,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (CD11b Antigen)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharide Receptors)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 1.6.3.- (NADPH Oxidases)', 'EC 1.6.3.1 (neutrophil cytosolic factor 1)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/*urine', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzamides', 'Blotting, Western', 'CD11b Antigen/analysis', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Lipopolysaccharide Receptors/analysis', 'NADPH Oxidases/genetics', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2008/05/15 09:00,2008/08/30 09:00,['2008/05/15 09:00'],"['2008/05/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/30 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/15 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi. 2007 Dec 25;87(48):3399-405.,48,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

L1210 DNA synthesis was preferentially inhibited which was achieved by (1) suppressing DNA polymerase alpha activity which reduced the synthesis of new strands of DNA, (2) reducing of de novo purine synthesis at the regulatory enzyme PRPP amido transferase which reduced d(GMP) levels, and (3) inhibiting of nucleoside kinase activities which further reduced DNA synthesis.

For instance, induction of HLA-DR antigens on human promyelocytic leukaemia HL-60 cells by interleukin-4 (IL-4) is of pivotal importance in immunology not only because class II expression is prerequisite to antigen recognition and response but also because IL-4 participates in a plethora of inflammatory or non-inflammatory reactions. At the same time, the same observation coupled with an increase in Mac-1, mature monocyte marker, is revealing ways to haematologists for converting malignant cases to normal situations. Based on previous reports that HLA-DR induction by IL-4 in the HL-60 system is mediated via the G-protein system (p21(ras)), this study was undertaken in order to define the intermediate signalling steps followed by this agent from the moment it is added to cultures to the differentiated cellular form obtained. It is proposed that IL-4 increases p21(ras) which in turn suppresses the HL-60 cells' p34(cdc2) constitutive expression. This inhibition appears to be responsible for the subsequently.observed cessation ofgrowth. Concomitant to decreased cellular proliferation, HI-DR antigen expression increases, a finding that matches the initially mentioned induction of p21(ras) since its inhibition abolishes HI-DR upregulation.","['Vassiliadis, S']",['Vassiliadis S'],['University of Crete Department of Biology P.O.

In order to test the granulopoietic regulatory mechanism in leukaemic mice, we investigated the regulatory role of granulopoietic humoral inhibitors during in vivo granulopoiesis. We noticed that mice suffering from acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) are unable to augment the production of these humoral inhibitory factors when acute inflammation is induced, since no change in DC cell content was observed with or without prior inflammation. Moreover, unlike healthy mice, the serum of leukaemic mice withdrawn during the inhibition phase of acute inflammation did not show any inhibitory activity toward granulocyte-monocyte (GM) colony growth in vitro.

Plasma-free concentration was deduced from a model incorporating plasma levels of alpha(1)-acid glycoprotein. Associations between AUC (or clearance) and response or incidence of side effects were explored by logistic regression analysis. Influence of KIT genotype was also assessed in GIST patients. Both total (in GIST) and free drug exposure (in CML and GIST) correlated with the occurrence and number of side effects (e.g. odds ratio 2.7+/-0.6 for a two-fold free AUC increase in GIST; P<0.001). Higher free AUC also predicted a higher probability of therapeutic response in GIST (odds ratio 2.6+/-1.1; P=0.026) when taking into account tumour KIT genotype (strongest association in patients harbouring exon 9 mutation or wild-type KIT, known to decrease tumour sensitivity towards imatinib).

However, this compound is rapidly inactivated by enzymatic deamination and can also induce drug resistance. To overcome the above drawbacks, we recently designed a new squalenoyl nanomedicine of dFdC [4-N-trisnorsqualenoyl-gemcitabine (SQdFdC)] by covalently coupling gemcitabine with the 1,1',2-trisnorsqualenic acid; the resultant nanomedicine displayed impressively greater anticancer activity compared with the parent drug in an experimental murine model. In the present study, we report that SQdFdC nanoassemblies triggered controlled and prolonged release of dFdC and displayed considerably greater t(1/2) (approximately 3.9-fold), mean residence time (approximately 7.5-fold) compared with the dFdC administered as a free drug in mice. It was also observed that the linkage of gemcitabine to the 1,1',2-trisnorsqualenic acid noticeably delayed the metabolism of dFdC into its inactive difluorodeoxyuridine (dFdU) metabolite, compared with dFdC. Additionally, the elimination of SQdFdC nanoassemblies was considerably lower compared with free dFdC, as indicated by lower radioactivity found in urine and kidneys, in accordance with the plasmatic concentrations of dFdU. SQdFdC nanoassemblies also underwent considerably higher distribution to the organs of the reticuloendothelial system, such as spleen and liver (p < 0.05), both after single- or multiple-dose administration schedule. Herein, this paper brings comprehensive pharmacokinetic and biodistribution insights that may explain the previously observed greater efficacy of SQdFdC nanoassemblies against experimental leukemia.","['Reddy, L Harivardhan', 'Khoury, Hania', 'Paci, Angelo', 'Deroussent, Alain', 'Ferreira, Humberto', 'Dubernet, Catherine', 'Decleves, Xavier', 'Besnard, Madeleine', 'Chacun, Helene', 'Lepetre-Mouelhi, Sinda', 'Desmaele, Didier', 'Rousseau, Bernard', 'Laugier, Christelle', 'Cintrat, Jean-Christophe', 'Vassal, Gilles', 'Couvreur, Patrick']","['Reddy LH', 'Khoury H', 'Paci A', 'Deroussent A', 'Ferreira H', 'Dubernet C', 'Decleves X', 'Besnard M', 'Chacun H', 'Lepetre-Mouelhi S', 'Desmaele D', 'Rousseau B', 'Laugier C', 'Cintrat JC', 'Vassal G', 'Couvreur P']","['Faculte de Pharmacie, Unite Mixte de Recherche Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique 8612, Institut Federatif de Recherche 141, Universite Paris XI, Chatenay-Malabry cedex, France.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Drug Metab Dispos,Drug metabolism and disposition: the biological fate of chemicals,9421550,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0W860991D6 (Deoxycytidine)', '7QWM220FJH (Squalene)', 'B76N6SBZ8R (gemcitabine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/blood/metabolism/*pharmacokinetics', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Deoxycytidine/*analogs & derivatives/blood/metabolism/pharmacokinetics', 'Female', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Squalene/*metabolism', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry', 'Tissue Distribution']",2008/05/14 09:00,2008/09/27 09:00,['2008/05/14 09:00'],"['2008/05/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/27 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/14 09:00 [entrez]']","['dmd.108.020735 [pii]', '10.1124/dmd.108.020735 [doi]']",ppublish,Drug Metab Dispos. 2008 Aug;36(8):1570-7. doi: 10.1124/dmd.108.020735.

There are increased nucleotide constraints in the three microRNA seed sites among Hoxa9 genes beyond that required to maintain protein identity, suggesting additional functional conservation. In preliminary experiments, forced expression of these microRNAs in Hoxa9-immortalized bone marrow cells downregulated the HOXA9 protein and caused loss of biological activity. The microRNAs were shown to target their predicted sites within the homeobox. miR-126 and Hoxa9 mRNA are coexpressed in hematopoietic stem cells and downregulated in parallel during progenitor cell differentiation; however, miR-145 is barely detectable in hematopoietic cells, and let-7s are highly expressed in bone marrow progenitors, suggesting that miR-126 may function in normal hematopoietic cells to modulate HOXA9 protein. In support of this hypothesis, expression of miR-126 alone in MLL-ENL-immortalized bone marrow cells decreased endogenous HOXA9 protein, while inhibition of endogenous miR-126 increased expression of HOXA9 in F9 cells.","['Shen, Wei-Fang', 'Hu, Yu-Long', 'Uttarwar, Lalita', 'Passegue, Emmanuelle', 'Largman, Corey']","['Shen WF', 'Hu YL', 'Uttarwar L', 'Passegue E', 'Largman C']","['Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, California, USA. wfshen@itsa.ucsf.edu']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (MIRN126 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (homeobox protein HOXA9)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Conserved Sequence', 'Down-Regulation', '*Genes, Homeobox', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'MicroRNAs/*metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Sequence Alignment']",2008/05/14 09:00,2008/07/17 09:00,['2008/05/14 09:00'],"['2008/05/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/14 09:00 [entrez]']","['MCB.01652-07 [pii]', '10.1128/MCB.01652-07 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2008 Jul;28(14):4609-19. doi: 10.1128/MCB.01652-07.

METHODS: G-banded analysis was performed on unstimulated bone marrow (BM) or peripheral blood (PB) cells after short-term (24-hour) culture. CGH was performed on reference (control) and neoplastic (test patient) genomic DNA extracted from BM or PB samples. Interphase FISH (i-FISH) was selectively carried out at disease diagnosis on patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and acute myeloid leukaemia using conventional methods. RESULTS: Genomic rearrangements were detected in 4, 7 and 6 patients using G-banding, CGH and i-FISH respectively. Discordance in results between G-banding, CGH and/or i-FISH was found in 7 of the 12 patients screened. G-banding and CGH, when used individually, detected a genomic imbalance/rearrangement in 33.3% and 58.3%, respectively, of the patients screened. However, when both screening methods were integrated, the abnormality detection rate increased to 66.7%. This detection rate increased further to 75.0% with the use of i-FISH screening. CONCLUSIONS: The advantages and disadvantages of using G-banding, CGH and i-FISH as either stand-alone or integrated screening methods for the detection and characterisation of genomic imbalances in acute leukaemia are clearly demonstrated. Abnormality detection rate significantly increased when an integrated screening approach was employed which could potentially provide valuable information for risk stratification in patients with acute leukaemia.","['McGrattan, P', 'Campbell, S', 'Cuthbert, R', 'Jones, F G C', 'McMullin, M F', 'Humphreys, M']","['McGrattan P', 'Campbell S', 'Cuthbert R', 'Jones FG', 'McMullin MF', 'Humphreys M']","['Department of Medical Genetics, Belfast City Hospital, Belfast Health & Social Care Trust, Belfast, Northern Ireland. peter.mcgrattan@belfasttrust.hscni.net']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Clin Pathol,Journal of clinical pathology,0376601,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Banding/methods', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence/methods', 'Interphase', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization/methods']",2008/05/14 09:00,2008/08/21 09:00,['2008/05/14 09:00'],"['2008/05/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/21 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/14 09:00 [entrez]']","['jcp.2008.056465 [pii]', '10.1136/jcp.2008.056465 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Pathol. 2008 Aug;61(8):903-8. doi: 10.1136/jcp.2008.056465.

The mechanisms leading to spontaneous expression of iNOS in these cells are presently unknown. The restricted use of some V(H) sub-groups and the sequences of the monoclonal immunoglobulins of the B-cell receptor expressed by the leukemia cells suggested that the latter have encountered specific auto-antigens and/or microbial derived antigens. Their binding to the BCR provides an activation signal resulting in enhanced survival, hence could be involved in the aetiology of the disease. At the interface of innate and cognate immunity, Toll-like receptors, TLR, recognize PAMPs (pathogen-associated molecular patterns) expressed by various bacteria and virus as well as some self-antigens. We thus hypothesized that TLR were involved in the early steps of B-CLL oncogenesis, notably apoptosis resistance through the induction of iNOS expression and the production of NO. Our results show that B-CLL cells express TLR-7 and TLR-9. Incubation of B-CLL cells with TLR-7 agonists effectively resulted in an increased resistance to apoptosis that was reverted with the NOS inhibitor L-NMMA. This resistance was associated with enhanced iNOS expression (protein and mRNA) and NO release, stimulation of NF-kappaB activation, phosphorylation of I kappaB alpha, all these events being suppressed with wedelolactone or Bay 11-7085, two inhibitors of I kappaB alpha phosphorylation. Our present data thus suggest that TLR-7 signaling stimulates apoptosis resistance, notably through an NF-kappaB-dependent activation of the NO pathway.","['Hammadi, Amar', 'Billard, Christian', 'Faussat, Anne-Marie', 'Kolb, Jean-Pierre']","['Hammadi A', 'Billard C', 'Faussat AM', 'Kolb JP']","[""UMRS 872 INSERM/Universite Pierre et Marie Curie/Universite Paris Descartes, Equipe 18, Centre de Recherche des Cordeliers, 15 rue de l'Ecole de Medecine, 75270 Paris cedex 06, Paris, France.""]",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Nitric Oxide,Nitric oxide : biology and chemistry,9709307,"['0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (TLR7 protein, human)', '0 (TLR9 protein, human)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 7)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 9)', '31C4KY9ESH (Nitric Oxide)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (NOS2 protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (Nitric Oxide Synthase Type II)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Apoptosis', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'Nitric Oxide/*metabolism', 'Nitric Oxide Synthase Type II/*genetics', 'Phosphorylation', 'Signal Transduction', 'Toll-Like Receptor 7/*metabolism', 'Toll-Like Receptor 9/metabolism']",2008/05/14 09:00,2008/09/18 09:00,['2008/05/14 09:00'],"['2008/02/04 00:00 [received]', '2008/04/17 00:00 [revised]', '2008/04/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/05/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/18 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/14 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1089-8603(08)00070-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.niox.2008.04.017 [doi]']",ppublish,Nitric Oxide. 2008 Sep;19(2):138-45. doi: 10.1016/j.niox.2008.04.017.

METHODS: Clinical, serological as well as histopathological, immunohistochemical, and flow cytometric evaluations of blood/bone marrow of 21 patients with T-LGL lymphocytosis were performed. The bone marrow samples were also investigated for T-cell receptor (TCR) and immunoglobulin (IG) gene rearrangements by polymerase chain reaction with heteroduplex analysis. RESULTS: Neutropenia was observed in 21 patients, splenomegaly in 10, autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in 9, unclassified arthritis resembling RA in 2, and autoimmune thyroiditis in 5 patients. T-LGL leukemia was recognized in 19 cases. Features of Felty syndrome were observed in all RA patients, representing a spectrum of T-LGL proliferations from reactive polyclonal through transitional between reactive and monoclonal to T-LGL leukemia. Bone marrow trephines from T-LGL leukemia patients showed interstitial clusters and intrasinusoidal linear infiltrations of CD3+/CD8+/CD57+/granzyme B+ lymphocytes, reactive lymphoid nodules, and decreased or normal granulocyte precursor count with left-shifted maturation. In three-color flow cytometry (FCM), T-LGL leukemia cells demonstrated CD2, CD3, and CD8 expression as well as a combination of CD16, CD56, or CD57. Abnormalities of other T-cell antigen expressions (especially CD5, CD7, and CD43) were also detected. In patients with polyclonal T-LGL lymphocytosis, T cells were dispersed in the bone marrow and the expression of pan-T-cell antigens in FCM was normal. Molecular studies revealed TCRB and TCRG gene rearrangements in 13 patients and TCRB, TCRG, and TCRD in 4 patients. The most frequently rearranged regions of variable genes were Vbeta-Jbeta1, Jbeta2 and Vgamma If Vgamma10-Jgamma. Moreover, in 4 patients, additional rearrangements of IG kappa and lambda variable genes of B cells were also observed. CONCLUSION: RA and neutropenia patients represented a continuous spectrum of T-LGL proliferations, although monoclonal expansions were most frequently observed. The histopathological pattern and immunophenotype of bone marrow infiltration as well as molecular characteristics were similar in T-LGL leukemia patients with and without arthritis.","['Prochorec-Sobieszek, Monika', 'Rymkiewicz, Grzegorz', 'Makuch-Lasica, Hanna', 'Majewski, Miroslaw', 'Michalak, Katarzyna', 'Rupinski, Robert', 'Warzocha, Krzysztof', 'Maryniak, Renata']","['Prochorec-Sobieszek M', 'Rymkiewicz G', 'Makuch-Lasica H', 'Majewski M', 'Michalak K', 'Rupinski R', 'Warzocha K', 'Maryniak R']","['Department of Pathomorphology, Institute of Hematology and Transfusion Medicine, I, Gandhi 14, 02-776 Warsaw, Poland. monika.prochorec@interia.pl']",,['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Arthritis Res Ther,Arthritis research & therapy,101154438,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Arthritis, Rheumatoid/immunology/pathology', 'Arthropathy, Neurogenic/immunology/*pathology', 'Bone Marrow/immunology/pathology', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Inflammation/immunology/pathology', 'Leukemia, Large Granular Lymphocytic/immunology/*pathology', 'Lymphocytosis/immunology/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutropenia/immunology/*pathology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/*pathology']",2008/05/14 09:00,2008/12/17 09:00,['2008/05/14 09:00'],"['2008/01/24 00:00 [received]', '2008/03/29 00:00 [revised]', '2008/05/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/05/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/14 09:00 [entrez]']","['ar2424 [pii]', '10.1186/ar2424 [doi]']",ppublish,Arthritis Res Ther. 2008;10(3):R55. doi: 10.1186/ar2424.

HTLV-1 is associated with adult T-cell leukemia and a variety of immune-mediated disorders including the chronic neurological disease termed HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis. In contrast, HTLV-2 displays distinct biological differences and is much less pathogenic, with only a few reported cases of leukemia and neurological disease associated with infection. In addition to the structural and enzymatic proteins, HTLV encodes regulatory (Tax and Rex) and accessory proteins. Tax and Rex positively regulate virus production and are critical for efficient viral replication and pathogenesis. Using an over-expression system approach, we recently reported that the accessory gene product of the HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 open reading frame (ORF) II (p30 and p28, respectively) acts as a negative regulator of both Tax and Rex by binding to and retaining their mRNA in the nucleus, leading to reduced protein expression and virion production. Further characterization revealed that p28 was distinct from p30 in that it was devoid of major transcriptional modulating activity, suggesting potentially divergent functions that may be responsible for the distinct pathobiologies of HTLV-1 and HTLV-2. RESULTS: In this study, we investigated the functional significance of p28 in HTLV-2 infection, proliferation, and immortaliztion of primary T-cells in culture, and viral survival in an infectious rabbit animal model. An HTLV-2 p28 knockout virus (HTLV-2Deltap28) was generated and evaluated. Infectivity and immortalization capacity of HTLV-2Deltap28 in vitro was indistinguishable from wild type HTLV-2. In contrast, we showed that viral replication was severely attenuated in rabbits inoculated with HTLV-2Deltap28 and the mutant virus failed to establish persistent infection. CONCLUSION: We provide direct evidence that p28 is dispensable for viral replication and cellular immortalization of primary T-lymphocytes in cell culture. However, our data indicate that p28 function is critical for viral survival in vivo. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that p28 repression of Tax and Rex-mediated viral gene expression may facilitate survival of these cells by down-modulating overall viral gene expression.","['Yamamoto, Brenda', 'Li, Min', 'Kesic, Matthew', 'Younis, Ihab', 'Lairmore, Michael D', 'Green, Patrick L']","['Yamamoto B', 'Li M', 'Kesic M', 'Younis I', 'Lairmore MD', 'Green PL']","['Center for Retrovirus Research, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA. yamamoto.26@osu.edu']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",England,Retrovirology,Retrovirology,101216893,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '0 (tax protein, Human T-lymphotrophic virus 2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/blood', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Gene Products, tax/genetics/metabolism', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Genome, Viral', 'HTLV-II Infections/immunology/virology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 2/genetics/isolation & purification/*pathogenicity/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/physiology/virology', 'Rabbits', 'Retroviridae Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Viral Proteins/genetics/metabolism', '*Virus Replication']",2008/05/14 09:00,2008/07/22 09:00,['2008/05/14 09:00'],"['2008/04/01 00:00 [received]', '2008/05/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/05/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/22 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/14 09:00 [entrez]']","['1742-4690-5-38 [pii]', '10.1186/1742-4690-5-38 [doi]']",epublish,Retrovirology. 2008 May 12;5:38. doi: 10.1186/1742-4690-5-38.,,,,"['P01 CA100730/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA100730-06/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA100730/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",20080512,PMC2405800,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Graft versus Host Disease (GVHD) is an inflammatory disorder in the recipient, which accounts for significant morbidity and mortality after allogeneic HSCT and directly limits the success of this procedure. Current treatment options for GVHD include intense immunosuppression, which in turn has associated side effects, an increased risk of infective complications, and a potential for increased relapse of haematological malignancy. A major benefit of allogeneic HSCT arises from reduced relapse rate of the underlying disease, which is believed to be due to the graft versus tumour or graft versus leukaemia (GVL) effect where donor immune cells recognize recipient tumour antigens. It is well established that GVL is linked to the occurrence of GVHD. Effective prophylaxis of GVHD while allowing some GVL effect is an important, yet currently elusive, therapeutic goal in HSCT. Strategies to prevent GVHD include T-cell depletion, immunosuppression, gut decontamination and appropriate donor selection. Cyclosporin (CsA) and/or methotrexate (MTX) have formed the basis of many GVHD prophylaxis strategies with no major advances on this gold standard for over twenty years. This review seeks to outline the most effective methods for the prevention of GVHD with a particular emphasis on large randomised trials. Evidence on standard regimens, appropriate dosing and emerging strategies for GVHD prophylaxis for both myeloablative and reduced intensity conditioning HSCT will be explored.","['Potter, Victoria', 'Moore, John']","['Potter V', 'Moore J']","[""Haematology and Stem cell Transplantation Department, St. Vincent's Hospital, Sydney, Australia.""]",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United Arab Emirates,Rev Recent Clin Trials,Reviews on recent clinical trials,101270873,['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)'],IM,"['Graft vs Host Disease/*etiology/*prevention & control', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppression Therapy/*methods', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/administration & dosage', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Risk Factors']",2008/05/14 09:00,2008/07/11 09:00,['2008/05/14 09:00'],"['2008/05/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/11 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/14 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.2174/157488708784223790 [doi]'],ppublish,Rev Recent Clin Trials. 2008 May;3(2):130-8. doi: 10.2174/157488708784223790.,2,87,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The presence of a FLT3 mutation confers a poorer prognosis in disease-free survival and overall survival. Patients with an FLT3 mutation have poorer outcomes even with a concomitant nucleophosmin1 (NMP1) mutation, which is normally a good prognostic factor. These observations raise the question about how best to treat patients with AML who have FLT3 mutations. There are some retrospective data that allogeneic stem cell transplantation should be offered to patients with FLT3 mutations who have achieved a first remission, but prospective trials are lacking. There are a number of FLT3 inhibitors that are in various stages of clinical testing.

Furthermore, even if the age-specific incidence remains stable in the coming years, the incidence of AML in elderly people is expected to consistently increase, given the progressive ageing of the general population. Consequently, the treatment of the disease in aged individuals represents a daily challenge in clinical hematology. Several studies have shown that, in current practice, a high fraction of patients older than 60 years is negatively selected for inclusion in clinical trials that are based on intensive chemotherapy. Apart from performance status and comorbidity at diagnosis, other non-clinical factors can significantly affect therapeutic choice including the distance from hematologic institution, presence of a carer, physician's and patient's attitude, and the scientific interest of the physician in a given therapeutic programme. In daily practice, a combination of these factors results in relevant selection of patients for clinical trials. Clearly, preselection of patients with AML leads to misleading overly optimistic results in some studies. Treatment of AML in the elderly is difficult and well-controlled trials in this group of patients are uncommon. Frequently, higly selected patients are recruited to relatively small phase II unrandomised trials with complete remission (CR) rates ranging from 25 to 70 %. These figures may turn unrealistic in the current practice. The present article reviews results of most relevant studies addressing therapeutic results in elderly patients with AML. Questions to be addressed will include potential selection biases, results with conventional chemotherapy, the therapeutic potential of autologous and allogeneic stem cell transplantation and a critical review of results achieved with newly developed drugs.","['Ferrara, Felicetto', 'Pinto, Antonio']","['Ferrara F', 'Pinto A']","['Division of Hematology and Stem Cell Transplantation Unit, Cardarelli Hospital, Naples, Italy. felicettoferrara@katamail.com']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United Arab Emirates,Rev Recent Clin Trials,Reviews on recent clinical trials,101270873,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Evidence-Based Medicine', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/epidemiology', 'Middle Aged', 'Treatment Outcome']",2008/05/14 09:00,2008/06/18 09:00,['2008/05/14 09:00'],"['2008/05/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/18 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/14 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.2174/157488707779318099 [doi]'],ppublish,Rev Recent Clin Trials. 2007 Jan;2(1):33-41. doi: 10.2174/157488707779318099.,1,69,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Oblimersen is a 18-mer phosphorothioate antisense oligonucleotide designed to bind to the first six codons of the human bcl-2 mRNA. Phase I/II trials indicate that infusion of Oblimersen provides biologically relevant plasma levels that lead to downregulation of target Bcl-2 protein. Moreover, the use of Oblimersen in combination with chemotherapy in a variety of cancers has shown promising response rates with good tolerability. Randomized phase III trials are currently underway to evaluate whether the combined use of Oblimersen with standard treatment is superior to standard treatment alone in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, malignant melanoma and multiple myeloma. Overall, the enhanced efficacy of anticancer treatments of this bcl-2-targeted antisense therapy represents a promising new apoptosis-modulating strategy.","['Moreira, Joao Nuno', 'Santos, Adriana', 'Simoes, Sergio']","['Moreira JN', 'Santos A', 'Simoes S']","['Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Technology, Faculty of Pharmacy, and Center for Neuroscience and Cell Biology, University of Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal. jmoreira@ci.uc.pt']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United Arab Emirates,Rev Recent Clin Trials,Reviews on recent clinical trials,101270873,"['0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Thionucleotides)', '85J5ZP6YSL (oblimersen)']",IM,"['Breast Neoplasms', 'Carcinoma, Small Cell/drug therapy', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/secondary', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Melanoma/drug therapy', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Thionucleotides/blood/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/*therapeutic use']",2008/05/14 09:00,2008/06/11 09:00,['2008/05/14 09:00'],"['2008/05/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/11 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/14 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.2174/157488706778250050 [doi]'],ppublish,Rev Recent Clin Trials. 2006 Sep;1(3):217-35. doi: 10.2174/157488706778250050.,3,86,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has been shown that nelarabine has activity as a single agent in patients with T-cell malignancies that have relapsed or are refractory to other therapy. The ongoing research on nelarabine has earned fast-track status from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of patients with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and lymphoblastic lymphoma who have not responded to or whose disease has progressed during treatment with at least two standard regimens. It is likely that nelarabine will be a useful drug in the treatment of leukemic diseases in the future and therefore nelarabine is an interesting drug to study further.

Drugs that inhibit DNA methyltransferases or histone deacetylases were shown to have the potential to reactivate silenced genes and induce differentiation or apoptosis of malignant cells. The most intensively studied class of such agents is DNA methyltransferase inhibitors, including 5-azacytidine (azacitidine) and 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (decitabine). In 2004, azacitidine was approved for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome on the basis of phase II and III studies that showed a response rate (complete and partial responses) of 15%. Azacitidine is also being evaluated in clinical trials for other malignant diseases. Decitabine has response rates of 17-49% in myelodysplastic syndrome in multiple phase II and III studies and also activity in acute and chronic myelogenous leukemia. Histone deacetylase inhibitors belong to another class of epigenetic modifying agents that include depsipeptide, butyrate derivatives, suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid and valproic acid.

Concomitant research in this area has implemented a wide variety of approaches such as, aerosolized formulations, prodrug conjugates, liposomes, nanoparticles and beads. Some of these strategies were also aimed at overcoming the rapid metabolization and drug resistance associated with gemcitabine. Aerosolized formulations were employed to treat the local tumors, while other approaches were aimed at the systemic therapy of cancers. The liposomal formulations considerably increased the half-life and the area under the curve (AUC) of gemcitabine, and simultaneously caused a marked improvement in the anticancer activity against experimental solid tumors developed orthotopically or at subcutaneous site. Alternatively, the prodrug conjugates of gemcitabine displayed considerable activity in vivo against various tumors. Especially, in the case of leukemia in which gemcitabine was demonstrated to be inactive, the lipidic conjugates displayed marked efficiency following systemic and oral administration. These conjugates induced greater apoptosis and also caused resistance reversal in the resistant leukemia types. Altogether, the delivery strategies adopted for gemcitabine led to a considerable improvement in the treatment of cancers at the preclinical stage, and some of them are potential candidates for clinical trials.","['Reddy, L Harivardhan', 'Couvreur, Patrick']","['Reddy LH', 'Couvreur P']","['Univ.

These defects are also frequently associated with a low rate of response to standard chemotherapy and with a poor survival in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The major form of apoptosis proceeds through the mitochondrial pathway, with the mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization, leading to the release of proteins normally found in the space between the inner and outer mitochondrial membranes (cytochrome C, AIF and others). Higher levels of anti-apoptosis proteins bcl-2, bcl-x(L), Mcl-1 block permeabilization of the membrane and are reported in AML patients presenting a poor outcome. On the contrary, activated pro-apoptotic bax or bad proteins allow this permeabilization and are correlated to a good prognosis in AML. Defects in the mitochondrial pathway induce multidrug-resistance and confer important prognostic information in AML. High ratios of bcl-2 to bax protein confer a poor prognosis with decreased rates of complete remission and overall survival. The prognostic information from the ratio of the proteins is greater than bcl-2 levels alone. Recently, we confirmed the impressive impact of the bax/bcl-2 ratio, determined by flow cytometry, on AML prognosis (complete remission and overall survival) in 255 AML patients. Bcl-2 down regulation might lower the apoptotic threshold of leukemic cells and, through this mechanism, favor response to chemotherapy. Phase II studies of oblimersen (antisense Bcl-2), cytarabine and daunorubicin or oblimersen plus gentuzumab, a cytotoxic antibody directed against CD33+ cells in relapsed AMLs, showed promising results. Defects in apoptosome proteins, such as APAF-1, are frequent in AML and treatment with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine, a specific inhibitor of DNA methylation, restored APAF-1 expression in leukemic cells. In conclusion, targeted therapies that are designed to induce apoptosis in leukemic cells, are the most promising anti-leukemia strategies. The elucidation of the apoptotic machinery and of its defects in AML lays the basis for developing new drugs able to trigger apoptosis and overcome therapy resistance.","['Del Poeta, G', 'Bruno, A', 'Del Principe, M I', 'Venditti, A', 'Maurillo, L', 'Buccisano, F', 'Stasi, R', 'Neri, B', 'Luciano, F', 'Siniscalchi, A', 'de Fabritiis, P', 'Amadori, S']","['Del Poeta G', 'Bruno A', 'Del Principe MI', 'Venditti A', 'Maurillo L', 'Buccisano F', 'Stasi R', 'Neri B', 'Luciano F', 'Siniscalchi A', 'de Fabritiis P', 'Amadori S']","['Cattedra di Ematologia, Universita Tor Vergata, Ospedale S.Eugenio, P.le Umanesimo, 10, 00144 Roma, Italy. g.delpoeta@tin.it']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Netherlands,Curr Cancer Drug Targets,Current cancer drug targets,101094211,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/metabolism', 'Drug Design', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Treatment Outcome']",2008/05/14 09:00,2008/06/13 09:00,['2008/05/14 09:00'],"['2008/05/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/13 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/14 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.2174/156800908784293640 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Cancer Drug Targets. 2008 May;8(3):207-22. doi: 10.2174/156800908784293640.,3,110,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Depending on genotype, each gram of soy hydrolysates contained 2.7-6.6 micromol of total daidzein, 3.0-4.7 micromol of total genistein, 0.5-1.3 micromol of glycitein, 2.1-2.8 micromol of total saponins, 0.1-0.2 micromol of lunasin, and 0.1-0.6 micromol of Bowman-Birk inhibitor (BBI). The IC 50 values calculated from a partial least-squares (PLS) analysis model correlated well with experimental data ( R (2) = 0.99). Isoflavones and beta-conglycinin positively contributed to the cytotoxicity of soy on L1210 leukemia cells. Lunasin and BBI were potent L1210 cell inhibitors (IC 50 = 13.9 and 22.5 microM, respectively), but made modest contributions to the activity of defatted soy flour hydrolysates due to their relatively low concentrations.

A phase 1 study was conducted to determine the maximum tolerated dose and toxicities of XL119 in patients with advanced myelodysplastic syndrome and relapsed or refractory acute leukemias. METHODS: Thirty-one patients were treated at 7 dose levels ranging from 140 to 260 mg/m(2)/daily times 5 in a 21-day cycle. Consenting patients had correlative biologic parameters studied. RESULTS: Dose-limiting toxicity was grade 3/4 mucositis. The recommended phase 2 dose in hematologic malignancies is 240 mg/m(2)/daily times 5 in a 21-day cycle. Clinically significant reduction in bone marrow blasts were seen in 5 patients and additional patients had reductions in peripheral blood blasts. However, the responses were transient.

In this study, by treating an acute leukaemic cell line with different antioxidants, ROS generation was shown to be crucially involved in the modulation of glucose transport (mediated by Glut1), which is frequently up-regulated in cancer cells. Then, this study tried to elucidate ROS source(s) and mechanisms by which ROS are involved in Glut1 activity regulation. Results prove that Nox2 and Nox4 are the candidates and that phosphorylation processes are important in the regulation of glucose uptake on which cancer cells rely. On the whole, data suggest that both Glut1 and Nox homologues may be considered new potential targets in the treatment of leukaemia.","['Prata, Cecilia', 'Maraldi, Tullia', 'Fiorentini, Diana', 'Zambonin, Laura', 'Hakim, Gabriele', 'Landi, Laura']","['Prata C', 'Maraldi T', 'Fiorentini D', 'Zambonin L', 'Hakim G', 'Landi L']","['Department of Biochemistry, University of Bologna, Italy. cecilia.prata@unibo.it']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Free Radic Res,Free radical research,9423872,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Glucose Transporter Type 1)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (SLC2A1 protein, human)', 'EC 1.6.3.- (CYBB protein, human)', 'EC 1.6.3.- (NADPH Oxidase 2)', 'EC 1.6.3.- (NADPH Oxidase 4)', 'EC 1.6.3.- (NADPH Oxidases)', 'EC 1.6.3.- (NOX4 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)']",IM,"['Antioxidants/metabolism', 'Biological Transport', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Glucose/metabolism/*pharmacokinetics', 'Glucose Transporter Type 1/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*metabolism', 'NADPH Oxidase 2', 'NADPH Oxidase 4', 'NADPH Oxidases/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', '*Reactive Oxygen Species']",2008/05/14 09:00,2008/08/22 09:00,['2008/05/14 09:00'],"['2008/05/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/22 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/14 09:00 [entrez]']","['792068857 [pii]', '10.1080/10715760802047344 [doi]']",ppublish,Free Radic Res. 2008 May;42(5):405-14. doi: 10.1080/10715760802047344.,5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CLL primarily affects the elderly and may be associated with multiple comorbidities. A cure has not been identified, and new treatment options are needed. Expression of Bcl-2 protein is associated with the pathogenesis of CLL and chemotherapy resistance. Oblimersen, a Bcl-2 antisense phosphorothioate oligonucleotide, is being evaluated in patients with CLL and other cancers; trials through Phase III have been completed. In the setting of relapsed/refractory CLL, single-agent oblimersen demonstrates modest activity, whereas the addition of oblimersen to fludarabine/cyclophosphamide significantly improves the rate of complete and nodular partial responses; moreover, these responses are durable and associated with clinical benefit. Oblimersen is more efficacious in relapsed rather than refractory patients. The side effect profile of oblimersen, alone or in combination with standard chemotherapy, is favorable compared with currently available chemotherapies. In the first cycle, an infusion reaction with or without tumor lysis syndrome is uncommon, and transient thrombocytopenia is observed. Catheter-related complications are associated with the need for continuous intravenous infusion of oblimersen over several days; other routes of administration are under clinical investigation. Oblimersen is a promising therapeutic approach for patients with relapsed CLL and should be further evaluated in the front-line setting.","['Cheson, Bruce D']",['Cheson BD'],"['Georgetown University Hospital, The Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center Washington, DC, USA.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],New Zealand,Ther Clin Risk Manag,Therapeutics and clinical risk management,101253281,,,,2008/05/14 09:00,2008/05/14 09:01,['2008/05/14 09:00'],"['2008/05/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/14 09:01 [medline]', '2008/05/14 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Ther Clin Risk Manag. 2007 Oct;3(5):855-70.,5,,,,,PMC2376092,,,,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Bcl-2 antisense', 'G3139', 'Genasense(R)', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'oblimersen']",,,,

In phase 2 and 3 studies, decitabine has been associated with durable responses in MDS patients and delayed time to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) transformation or death compared with supportive care. Decitabine has been shown to be well tolerated with a toxicity profile expected for this class of agent.

The effect of pokeweed mitogen (PWM) was variable and not significant. The levels of IL-6 were below the detection limit (60 pg/ml) in sera of 13 CLL patients whereas sIL-6R was detected (13 ng/ml to 97 ng/ml) in the 13 sera. IL6 was not detected in cultures of unstimulated or stimulated with PMA or PWM normal human B cells. Levels of sIL-6R were minimal in cultures of normal B lymphocytes and were increased in PMA stimulated cultures. The results are consistent with the view that B-CLL cells produce spontaneously IL-6 which could act in an autocrine fashion to cause shedding of surface IL-6R and account for the correlation found between serum levels of sIL-6R and B-CLL lymphocyte numbers.

This rare occurrence precludes the conducting of large, prospective studies to examine diagnostic, management and outcome issues. The treatment of a pregnant woman with leukemia may be associated with severe adverse fetal outcome including death and malformations, and therefore poses a difficult challenge for both the patient and the attending physician. Chemotherapy during the 1st trimester is associated with an increased risk for congenital malformations. However, this risk diminishes as pregnancy advances. When acute leukemia is diagnosed during the 1st trimester, patients should be treated promptly similar to non-pregnant patients. However, the aggressive induction therapy should follow pregnancy termination. When the diagnosis is made later in pregnancy standard chemotherapy regimen should be considered and usually pregnancy termination is not mandatory. However, both the mother and the fetus should be under close observation and delivery should be postponed to a non-cytopenic period. Pregnancy associated chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) can be treated with interferon throughout pregnancy with no apparent increase in adverse fetal outcome. In the very rare case of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) during pregnancy treatment can usually be delayed until after delivery.","['Shapira, Tal', 'Pereg, David', 'Lishner, Michael']","['Shapira T', 'Pereg D', 'Lishner M']","['Department of Internal Medicine A, Meir Hospital, Sapir Medical Center, Kfar-Sava, Israel.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Blood Rev,Blood reviews,8708558,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Abortion, Induced', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/complications/*drug therapy', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications, Neoplastic/*drug therapy', 'Pregnancy Trimesters', '*Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects']",2008/05/13 09:00,2008/12/17 09:00,['2008/05/13 09:00'],"['2008/05/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0268-960X(08)00025-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.blre.2008.03.006 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Rev. 2008 Sep;22(5):247-59. doi: 10.1016/j.blre.2008.03.006.

Previous reports indicate MZF1 is an essential factor whose abnormal expression results in cancer. However, the molecular mechanisms by which MZF1 functions in development and contributes to cancer progression remain unknown. MZF1 is a member of the SCAN domain family of zinc finger proteins (SCAN-ZFP) that form dimers via their highly conserved SCAN motif. To better understand the molecular mechanism of MZF1 function, we sought to characterize the cellular localization pattern of MZF1 in the context of SCAN dimerization. Here we provide evidence that MZF1 is a constituent of promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies (PML-NBs) and that the SCAN domain is necessary for association with these intranuclear structures. In addition, the SCAN-ZFP member ZNF24 was identified as a novel heterodimeric partner of MZF1 that also associates with PML-NBs in a unique ring-type pattern. Finally, we provide support that MZF1 protein may be modified by SUMOylation, which provides further support for localization of MZF1 protein complexes to PML-NBs. Altogether, these data suggest that MZF1 is recruited to PML-NBs and that the SCAN domain may play an integral role in regulating the localization of heterodimeric protein complexes to these intranuclear structures.","['Noll, LeAnne', 'Peterson, Francis C', 'Hayes, Paulette L', 'Volkman, Brian F', 'Sander, Tara']","['Noll L', 'Peterson FC', 'Hayes PL', 'Volkman BF', 'Sander T']","[""Department of Surgery, Children's Research Institute Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI 53226, United States.""]",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (MZF1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Small Ubiquitin-Related Modifier Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Nucleus Structures/*chemistry', 'Dimerization', 'Humans', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/*analysis/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/analysis', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Small Ubiquitin-Related Modifier Proteins/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/analysis', 'Zinc Fingers']",2008/05/13 09:00,2008/08/30 09:00,['2008/05/13 09:00'],"['2008/01/02 00:00 [received]', '2008/03/03 00:00 [revised]', '2008/03/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/05/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/30 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0145-2126(08)00157-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2008.03.024 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2008 Oct;32(10):1582-92. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2008.03.024.

METHODS: Patients were allocated randomly to receive PPV either alone or with 3 doses of GM-CSF (250 microg) given before or after vaccination. Serum was obtained before, 4 weeks after, and 12 weeks after vaccination for antibody determination. Thirty-two patients with CLL were given PPV. They were randomized to receive 3 doses of GM-CSF either before or after vaccination or to receive no GM-CSF. RESULTS: A 4-fold rise in immunoglobulin G (IgG) to capsular polysaccharides from Streptococcus pneumoniae types 4, 6B, 9V, 14, 19F, and 23F occurred in <10% of patients in each of the 3 groups. There were no differences in geometric mean IgG levels in any of the 3 groups 4 weeks or 12 weeks after vaccination.

We selected two representatives of Bcl-2 family (anti-apoptotic Mcl-1 - myeloid cell line-1 and pro-apoptotic Bid - Bcl-2 homology domain 3 interacting death agonist), cytochrome c (cyt-c), and two initial caspases (-8 and -9) to evaluate their function in ionizing radiation (IR)-induced apoptosis in human leukaemic cell lines diverging in p53 (TP53 tumor suppressor gene) status. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 30 microg of proteins of whole-cell lysates or 10 microg of mitochondrial protein fractions were electrophoretically separated and analyzed by Western-blotting. RESULTS: Here we show that in both HL-60 (p53 null) and MOLT-4 (p53 wild type) leukaemic cells the amount of Mcl-1 initially increased after irradiation by sublethal but not by lethal dose and later (when apoptosis occurred) it decreased in a dose-dependent manner. Caspase-8 was cleaved and afterwards the amount of Bid decreased as it was truncated. We also found cyt-c release from the inner mitochondrial membrane space into cytoplasm to be dose-dependent and it was followed by induction of apoptosis. In the p53-null cells caspase-8 was activated prior caspase-9, whereas the cells harboring p53 exhibited a simultaneous activation of both initial caspases. CONCLUSION: IR induced a decrease in Mcl-1, activation of Bid, caspase-8, and -9, and release of cyt-c. Presented data indicate that both extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis signalling pathways were activated in HL-60 and MOLT-4 cells upon exposure to IR regardless to the p53 status.","['Tichy, Ales', 'Zaskodova, Darina', 'Pejchal, Jaroslav', 'Rezacova, Martina', 'Osterreicher, Jan', 'Vavrova, Jirina', 'Cerman, Jaroslav']","['Tichy A', 'Zaskodova D', 'Pejchal J', 'Rezacova M', 'Osterreicher J', 'Vavrova J', 'Cerman J']","['Department of Radiobiology, Faculty of Health Sciences in Hradec Kralove, University of Defence, Brno. tichy@pmfhk.cz']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Int J Radiat Biol,International journal of radiation biology,8809243,"['0 (BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein)', '0 (BID protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein/*metabolism', 'Caspase 8/*metabolism', 'Caspase 9/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytochromes c/*metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation/radiation effects', 'Gamma Rays/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism']",2008/05/13 09:00,2008/08/20 09:00,['2008/05/13 09:00'],"['2008/05/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/20 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['793020223 [pii]', '10.1080/09553000802078404 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Radiat Biol. 2008 Jun;84(6):523-30. doi: 10.1080/09553000802078404.,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The immunophenotype of the blastic cell population was incompatible with that of the pre-transplant blast cells; a mutation in C/EBPA gene was found in the pre-transplant blast cells that was not present in the post-transplant blast cells, and short tandem repeat analysis of marrow cells, which included 71% blasts, showed complete donor chimera. Thus, this recipient developed donor cell leukemia (DCL). The donor was healthy when DCL developed in the recipient as well as before donation of the peripheral blood stem cells. Only five cases of DCL after PBSCT have been reported in the literature. As a mechanism for the development of DCL, a vigorous proliferative demand on the donor cells, which often correlates with a higher likelihood of replication error or mutation, has been proposed. Peripheral blood stem cells might have an advantage in that they are associated with a low incidence of DCL development because PBSCT recipients receive a higher total cell dose than recipients of bone marrow or cord blood cells.","['Murata, Makoto', 'Ishikawa, Yuichi', 'Ohashi, Haruhiko', 'Terakura, Seitaro', 'Ozeki, Kazutaka', 'Kiyoi, Hitoshi', 'Naoe, Tomoki']","['Murata M', 'Ishikawa Y', 'Ohashi H', 'Terakura S', 'Ozeki K', 'Kiyoi H', 'Naoe T']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, 65 Tsurumai, Showa, Nagoya, Aichi, 466-8550, Japan. mmurata@med.nagoya-u.ac.jp.', 'Department of Infectious Diseases, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Clinical Research Center, National Hospital Organization, Nagoya Medical Center, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, 65 Tsurumai, Showa, Nagoya, Aichi, 466-8550, Japan.', 'Department of Infectious Diseases, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Infectious Diseases, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, 65 Tsurumai, Showa, Nagoya, Aichi, 466-8550, Japan.']",,['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha)'],IM,"['CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha/genetics', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', '*Living Donors', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', '*Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2008/05/13 09:00,2009/08/19 09:00,['2008/05/13 09:00'],"['2008/02/07 00:00 [received]', '2008/04/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/03/10 00:00 [revised]', '2008/05/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/19 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12185-008-0094-3 [doi]', '10.1007/s12185-008-0094-3 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2008 Jul;88(1):111-115. doi: 10.1007/s12185-008-0094-3.

Although insertions at the breakpoint region of the A1E fusion transcripts have been reported, additional structural alterations are largely uncharacterized. By RT-PCR amplifications and DNA sequencing, numerous in-frame and out-of-frame AML1b-ETO and AML1c-ETO transcripts were identified in 13 pediatric t(8;21) AMLs, likely resulting from alternate splicing, internal deletions and/or breakpoint region insertions involving both the AML1 (RUNX1) and ETO regions. The in-frame A1E fusion transcript forms represented minor forms. These structure alterations were found in AML1c-ETO but not AML1b-ETO transcripts in two adult t(8;21) AMLs. Although no analogous alterations were detected in native AML1b transcripts, identical alterations in native ETO transcripts were identified. When transfected into HeLa cells, only AML1b, and not the in-frame A1E forms, transactivated the GM-CSF promoter. In co-transfection experiments, the effects of A1E proteins on GM-CSF transactivation by AML1b ranged from repressive to activating.

Here we define the critical role of the promyelocytic leukaemia protein (PML) tumour suppressor in haematopoietic stem cell maintenance, and present a new therapeutic approach for targeting quiescent leukaemia-initiating cells and possibly cancer-initiating cells by pharmacological inhibition of PML.","['Ito, Keisuke', 'Bernardi, Rosa', 'Morotti, Alessandro', 'Matsuoka, Sahoko', 'Saglio, Giuseppe', 'Ikeda, Yasuo', 'Rosenblatt, Jacalyn', 'Avigan, David E', 'Teruya-Feldstein, Julie', 'Pandolfi, Pier Paolo']","['Ito K', 'Bernardi R', 'Morotti A', 'Matsuoka S', 'Saglio G', 'Ikeda Y', 'Rosenblatt J', 'Avigan DE', 'Teruya-Feldstein J', 'Pandolfi PP']","['Cancer Genetics Program, Beth Israel Deaconess Cancer Center, Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, New Research Building, 330 Brookline Avenue, Boston, Massachusetts 02215, USA.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Nature,Nature,0410462,"['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Pml protein, mouse)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cell Line', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/metabolism/*pathology', 'Nuclear Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism', 'Oxides/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Recurrence', 'Regeneration', 'Transcription Factors/antagonists & inhibitors/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism']",2008/05/13 09:00,2008/07/31 09:00,['2008/05/13 09:00'],"['2007/12/14 00:00 [received]', '2008/04/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/05/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/31 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['nature07016 [pii]', '10.1038/nature07016 [doi]']",ppublish,Nature. 2008 Jun 19;453(7198):1072-8. doi: 10.1038/nature07016.

We report the outcomes of a large series of adult patients who underwent syngeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for acute myeloblastic leukemia or acute lymphoblastic leukemia. DESIGN AND METHODS: The outcomes of all syngeneic transplants for acute myeloblastic or lymphoblastic leukemia reported to the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation registry were analyzed; a study of prognostic factors was performed for those transplanted in first complete remission. RESULTS: One hundred and sixty-two patients, 109 with acute myeloblastic leukemia and 53 with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, were identified; 116 were in first complete remission. Most of the patients did not receive prophylaxis against graft-versus-host disease. Nineteen patients developed acute graft-versus-host disease and only three patients developed chronic graft-versus-host disease. The median follow-up was 60 months. At 5 years the non-relapse mortality was 8 +/- 5%, the relapse incidence 49 +/- 8% and the leukemia-free survival 43 +/- 3%. The corresponding figures for patients in first complete remission were 7 +/- 2%, 40 +/- 4% and 53 +/- 5% at 5 years. Analysis of patients in first complete remission showed that the number of courses of chemotherapy required to induce first complete remission was the main risk factor: the leukemia-free survival at 5 years was 66 +/- 6% when first complete remission was reached after one induction course of chemotherapy and was only 20 +/- 9% when first complete remission was reached after at least two induction courses of chemotherapy (p = 0.0001); the relapse incidence was 30 +/- 6% and 54 +/- 10%, respectively (p = 0.007). CONCLUSIONS: Outcomes were better for patients transplanted in first complete remission than in second complete remission or a more advanced phase of the disease. When a syngeneic donor is available for patients with high risk acute leukemia, allotransplantation should be performed as soon as the first complete remission has been achieved, ideally with one course of chemotherapy.","['Fouillard, Loic', 'Labopin, Myriam', 'Gratwohl, Alois', 'Gluckman, Eliane', 'Frassoni, Francesco', 'Beelen, Dietrich W', 'Willemze, Roelof', 'Montserrat, Emili', 'Blaise, Didier', 'Atienza, Arturo Iriondo', 'Sierra, Jorge', 'Santos, Moema', 'Gorin, Norbert-Claude', 'Rocha, Vanderson']","['Fouillard L', 'Labopin M', 'Gratwohl A', 'Gluckman E', 'Frassoni F', 'Beelen DW', 'Willemze R', 'Montserrat E', 'Blaise D', 'Atienza AI', 'Sierra J', 'Santos M', 'Gorin NC', 'Rocha V']","['Department of Hematology, Hopital Saint-Antoine, AP-HP, 184 Rue du Faubourg Saint- Antoine, 75012 Paris, France. loic.fouillard@sat.ap-hopparis.fr']","['Acute Leukemia Working Party of the European Group for Blood and Marrow', 'Transplantation']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Diseases in Twins', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/*therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Risk Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",2008/05/13 09:00,2008/09/16 09:00,['2008/05/13 09:00'],"['2008/05/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/16 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.11277 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.11277 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2008 Jun;93(6):834-41. doi: 10.3324/haematol.11277.

The German AML-Intergroup, therefore, initiated a survey on quality of life of patients with a relapse-free survival of at least 5 years after first-line treatment. DESIGN AND METHODS: The EORTC Quality of Life Core Questionnaire (QLQ-C30), supplemented by information on self-assessed concomitant diseases, late treatment effects, and demographics was used. The questionnaire was returned by 419 of 818 patients (51.2%) identified by six study groups. The patients' median age at diagnosis was 42 years, and the median follow-up period was 8 years. One hundred and seventy patients were treated with stem cell transplantation (121 allogenic, 49 autologous) in first complete remission; the other 249 patients were treated with conventional chemotherapy. RESULTS: The ECOG activity index revealed normal activity in 45% vs. 60% of the patients in the allogeneic stem cell transplantation vs. conventional chemotherapy groups, respectively and disabled person status in 60% vs. 35%. All QLQ-C30 functions, except physical functioning and pain, were poorer in allogeneic stem cell transplantation patients. Problems in leisure-time activities, social life, and financial management, sexual limitations and adverse effects were significantly more frequent in patients after allogeneic stem cell transplantation than after conventional chemotherapy. Multivariate logistic regression models on global health status revealed concomitant disease, age > 45 years, and allogeneic stem cell transplantation as significant risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that, compared to conventional chemotherapy, allogeneic stem cell transplantation has a significantly worse long-term impact on quality of life. This needs to be considered when treatment options are discussed.","['Messerer, Dorle', 'Engel, Jutta', 'Hasford, Joerg', 'Schaich, Markus', 'Ehninger, Gerhard', 'Sauerland, Cristina', 'Buchner, Thomas', 'Schumacher, Andrea', 'Krahl, Rainer', 'Niederwieser, Dietger', 'Krauter, Jurgen', 'Ganser, Arnold', 'Creutzig, Ursula', 'Dohner, Hartmut', 'Schlenk, Richard F']","['Messerer D', 'Engel J', 'Hasford J', 'Schaich M', 'Ehninger G', 'Sauerland C', 'Buchner T', 'Schumacher A', 'Krahl R', 'Niederwieser D', 'Krauter J', 'Ganser A', 'Creutzig U', 'Dohner H', 'Schlenk RF']","['Institut fur Med.

As yet, little is known about DEHP effects in utero on fetal Leydig cells (FLC). The present study investigated effects of DEHP on FLC function. Pregnant Long-Evans female rats received vehicle (corn oil) or DEHP at 10, 100, or 750 mg/kg by oral gavage from gestational day (GD)2-20. At GD21, T production, FLC numbers and distribution, and testicular gene expression were examined. The percentage of FLC clusters containing 6-30 cells increased in all treatment groups, with 29 +/- 2% in control vs. 37 +/- 3, 35 +/- 3, and 56 +/- 4% in rats receiving 10, 100, and 750 mg/kg DEHP, respectively. In contrast, FLC numbers were 33% and 39% lower than control after exposures to 100 and 750 mg/kg DEHP, respectively. At these doses, mRNA levels of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) increased. LIF was found to induce cell aggregation in FLCs in vitro, consistent with the hypothesis that DEHP induced FLC aggregation. Testicular T levels were doubled by the 10 mg/kg dose and halved at 750 mg/kg. The mRNA levels of IGF-1 and c-Kit ligand (KITL) were induced by 10 mg/kg DEHP. These results, taken together, indicate that fetal exposures to DEHP have effects on FLC number, distribution, and most importantly, steroidogenic capacity and suggest that abnormal expressions of IGF1, KITL, and LIF genes may contribute to the reproductive toxicity of phthalates.","['Lin, Han', 'Ge, Ren-Shan', 'Chen, Guo-Rong', 'Hu, Guo-Xin', 'Dong, Lei', 'Lian, Qing-Quan', 'Hardy, Dianne O', 'Sottas, Chantal M', 'Li, Xiao-Kun', 'Hardy, Matthew P']","['Lin H', 'Ge RS', 'Chen GR', 'Hu GX', 'Dong L', 'Lian QQ', 'Hardy DO', 'Sottas CM', 'Li XK', 'Hardy MP']","['Population Council and the Rockefeller University, 1230 York Avenue, New York, NY 10021, USA.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '67763-96-6 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor I)', 'C42K0PH13C (Diethylhexyl Phthalate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Diethylhexyl Phthalate/*toxicity', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental/*drug effects', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor I/metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/biosynthesis', 'Leydig Cells/*cytology/*metabolism', 'Male', '*Maternal Exposure', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy, Animal', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Long-Evans', 'Stem Cell Factor/metabolism']",2008/05/13 09:00,2008/06/25 09:00,['2008/05/13 09:00'],"['2008/05/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/25 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['0709260105 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.0709260105 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2008 May 20;105(20):7218-22. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0709260105.

LeuLeuOMe induces lysosomal membrane permeabilization, resulting in release of lysosomal cathepsins that cleave the proapoptotic Bcl-2 family member Bid and degrade the antiapoptotic member Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, or Mcl-1. The papain-like cysteine protease inhibitor E-64d largely prevented apoptosis, Bid cleavage, and Bcl-2/Bcl-xL/Mcl-1 degradation. The pancaspase inhibitor N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp(OMe)fluoromethyl ketone failed to prevent Bid cleavage and degradation of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 homologues but substantially decreased cell death, suggesting that cathepsin-mediated apoptosis in these cellular models mostly follows a caspase-dependent pathway. Moreover, in vitro experiments showed that one or more of the cysteine cathepsins B, L, S, K, and H could cleave Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Mcl-1, Bak, and BimEL, whereas no Bax cleavage was observed. On the basis of inhibitor studies, we demonstrate that lysosomal disruption triggered by LeuLeuOMe occurs before mitochondrial damage. We propose that degradation of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members by lysosomal cathepsins synergizes with cathepsin-mediated activation of Bid to trigger a mitochondrial pathway to apoptosis. Moreover, XIAP (X-chromosome-linked inhibitor of apoptosis) was also found to be a target of cysteine cathepsins, suggesting that cathepsins can mediate caspase-dependent apoptosis also downstream of mitochondria.","['Droga-Mazovec, Gabriela', 'Bojic, Lea', 'Petelin, Ana', 'Ivanova, Saska', 'Romih, Rok', 'Repnik, Urska', 'Salvesen, Guy S', 'Stoka, Veronika', 'Turk, Vito', 'Turk, Boris']","['Droga-Mazovec G', 'Bojic L', 'Petelin A', 'Ivanova S', 'Romih R', 'Repnik U', 'Salvesen GS', 'Stoka V', 'Turk V', 'Turk B']","['Department of Biochemistry, Molecular and Structural Biology, J.

Progressive formation of intact monolayers was monitored using transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and passage of paracellular permeability (PP) markers. The mES cells were initially inoculated on inactivated mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) plus leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). At 75% confluence, cells were passaged in the absence of MEF and LIF to stimulate formation of rounded multicellular aggregates (MA). After 4 days, cultures containing MA were transferred to culture inserts coated with ECM components only, and grown in the presence of selected individual GFs. An additional 10-14 days revealed confluent monolayers with TEER values of 500-700 ohms cm2 (Omega cm2). Monolayers grown on inserts coated with ECM components, such as fibronectin or collagen-IV, in the presence of epidermal growth factor or keratinocyte growth factor in the medium, yielded the highest TEER measurements when compared to cultures grown without GFs or ECM. Acute cytotoxicity (AC) studies with confluent monolayers of mES cells in 96-well plates indicated that there is a high correlation (R2=0.91) between cell viability and TEER for 24-h exposure time. Also, decrease in TEER is inversely proportional with increase in PP of markers. In comparison to standardized Registry of Cytotoxicity (RC) data and TEER measurements, MTT IC50 values for mES cells are lower. Thus, at equivalent concentrations for the same chemicals, cell viability decreases before the integrity of the monolayer is compromised. This system represents a novel approach for the manipulation of mES cells toward specific intact monolayers, as an in vitro model for biological monolayer formation, and most importantly, for applications to cytotoxicity testing.","['Calabro, Anthony R', 'Konsoula, Roula', 'Barile, Frank A']","['Calabro AR', 'Konsoula R', 'Barile FA']","[""St. John's University College of Pharmacy and Allied Health Professions, Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Toxicology Division, 8000 Utopia Parkway, Queens, NY 11439, United States.""]",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Toxicol In Vitro,Toxicology in vitro : an international journal published in association with BIBRA,8712158,"['0 (Extracellular Matrix Proteins)', '0 (Formazans)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Tetrazolium Salts)', '0 (Xenobiotics)', '23305-68-2 (MTT formazan)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Culture Techniques/methods', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane Permeability/*drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Electric Impedance', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/*drug effects/pathology', 'Extracellular Matrix Proteins/metabolism', 'Formazans/metabolism', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Tetrazolium Salts/metabolism', 'Xenobiotics/metabolism/*toxicity']",2008/05/13 09:00,2008/08/30 09:00,['2008/05/13 09:00'],"['2007/08/01 00:00 [received]', '2008/02/27 00:00 [revised]', '2008/02/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/05/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/30 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0887-2333(08)00067-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.tiv.2008.02.023 [doi]']",ppublish,Toxicol In Vitro. 2008 Aug;22(5):1273-84. doi: 10.1016/j.tiv.2008.02.023.

These results indicate that AKT activation was induced by the depletion of mtDNA and inhibited TNF-induced apoptosis.","['Suzuki, Seigo', 'Naito, Akihiro', 'Asano, Takayuki', 'Evans, Teresa T', 'Reddy, Shrikanth A G', 'Higuchi, Masahiro']","['Suzuki S', 'Naito A', 'Asano T', 'Evans TT', 'Reddy SA', 'Higuchi M']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR 72205-7199, USA.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Ireland,Cancer Lett,Cancer letters,7600053,"['0 (Chromones)', '0 (DNA, Mitochondrial)', '0 (Morpholines)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '31M2U1DVID (2-(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromones/pharmacology', 'Clone Cells', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'DNA, Mitochondrial/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/*metabolism', 'Morpholines/pharmacology', 'Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*pharmacology']",2008/05/13 09:00,2008/10/15 09:00,['2008/05/13 09:00'],"['2007/11/19 00:00 [received]', '2008/03/04 00:00 [revised]', '2008/03/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/05/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/15 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0304-3835(08)00222-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.canlet.2008.03.020 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Lett. 2008 Sep 8;268(1):31-7. doi: 10.1016/j.canlet.2008.03.020.

However, the majority of these reports were limited to solid tumors. The purpose of this study was to investigate the antitumor activity of mda-7/IL-24 and the underlying mechanism in hematopoietic malignancies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We determined the expression of mda-7/IL24 and its heterodimeric receptors in hematopoietic tumor cell lines and then stably transfected mda-7/IL-24 into K562 (leukemia) and Namalwa (lymphoma) cell lines to assess the effects of mda-7/IL-24 on cell proliferation, cell cycle, apoptosis, colony-forming ability, and tumor growth in vivo. Microarray analysis was performed to determine the genes that were differentially regulated by mda-7/IL-24 in K562 cells. RESULTS: Expression of mda-7/IL-24 or its intact receptor pairs was not detected in the 11 cell lines tested. Ectopic expression of mda-7/IL-24 induced significant (p < 0.05) inhibition of cell growth and colony formation in both K562 and Namalwa cells, and the growth inhibition in K562 cells was associated with G(0)/G(1) cell-cycle arrest. Results of in vivo studies showed good correlation with in vitro inhibition of tumor cell proliferation in both the cell lines. We also showed that the increase in p21(WAF-1) and BCCIP and decrease in cdk6, smurf2, and phosphorylated pRb, which are regulators of cell-cycle progression, might account for G(0)/G(1) cell-cycle arrest in K562 cells. CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrated for the first time the potential antitumor activity of mda-7/IL-24 in chronic myelogenous leukemia and lymphoma.","['Dong, Cheng-Ya', 'Zhang, Fang', 'Duan, Yong-Juan', 'Yang, Bin-Xia', 'Lin, Yong-Min', 'Ma, Xiao-Tong']","['Dong CY', 'Zhang F', 'Duan YJ', 'Yang BX', 'Lin YM', 'Ma XT']","['State Key Laboratory for Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Interleukins)', '0 (interleukin-24)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/metabolism', 'Genetic Therapy/methods', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/genetics/metabolism/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Interleukins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Plasmids/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2008/05/13 09:00,2008/09/20 09:00,['2008/05/13 09:00'],"['2007/11/08 00:00 [received]', '2008/03/17 00:00 [revised]', '2008/03/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/05/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/20 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-472X(08)00123-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2008.03.009 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2008 Aug;36(8):938-46. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2008.03.009.

DESIGN: Prospective observational study. SETTING: University-based obstetrics and gynecology hospital. PATIENT(S): Thirty women undergoing salpingectomy for tubal pregnancy and 30 nonpregnant patients with benign uterine or appendix disease. INTERVENTION(S): Oviduct tissues with ectopic gestation were separated into implantation sites and nonimplantation sites. Samples of ampullary fallopian tubes during midsecretory phase were collected as control groups. Immunohistochemical and Western blot analysis were performed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): The differences of leukemia inhibitory factor expression between the implantation and nonimplantation sites of oviduct tissues and the normal and chronically inflamed fallopian tubes. RESULT(S): The expression of leukemia inhibitory factor in the implantation group is significantly higher than that in the nonimplantation group or in the normal group. A statistically significant difference was also found for leukemia inhibitory factor between the chronic inflammation group and the normal group by Western blot analysis but no difference between the chronic inflammation group and the implantation group or the nonimplantation group.

The mechanisms, however, by which proteasome inhibitors kill tumor cells are still fairly elusive as is the molecular basis of resistance to treatment. To address these questions, we employed a high-throughput Western blotting procedure to analyze changes in a subproteome of approximately 800 proteins in the promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL-60 upon treatment with the proteasome inhibitor PSI (Z-Ile-Glu(OtBu)-Ala-Leu-aldehyde) and correlated the changes of selected target proteins with the changes in two multidrug-resistant HL-60 variants. In total, 105 proteins were upregulated more than 1.5-fold after PSI treatment, while 79 proteins were downregulated. Activation of caspases-3 and -8, modulation of members of the Bcl-2 family as well as stimulation of stress signaling pathways was prominent during HL-60 apoptosis. We also identified changes in the abundance of proteins previously not known to be affected by proteasome inhibitors. In contrast, two multidrug-resistant HL-60 cell lines, overexpressing either MRP1 or P-glycoprotein were largely resistant to PSI-induced apoptosis and could not be resensitized by the pharmacological inhibitors of the drug efflux pumps MK571 or PSC833. Drug resistance was also independent of the upregulation of Bad. Overexpression of multidrug resistance proteins, P-glycoprotein and MRP-1 is thus not sufficient to explain resistance of HL-60 cells to treatment with proteasome inhibitor PSI, which remains more closely related to a low level of Bax expression and to the inability to activate JNK. Alternative routes to the acquisition of resistance to PSI have therefore to be considered.","['Choi, Mi-Ran', 'Najafi, Farhad', 'Safa, Ahmad R', 'Drexler, Hannes C A']","['Choi MR', 'Najafi F', 'Safa AR', 'Drexler HC']","['Max Planck Institute for Molecular Biomedicine, Department for Vascular Cell Biology, Roentgenstr. 20, 48149 Muenster, Germany. mirchoi@iupui.edu']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Proteasome Inhibitors)', '0 (Proteome)', '0 (benzyloxycarbonyl-isoleucyl-glutamyl(O-tert-butyl)-alanyl-leucinal)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Oligopeptides/*pharmacology', '*Proteasome Inhibitors', 'Protein Biosynthesis/*drug effects', 'Proteome/*biosynthesis', 'Time Factors']",2008/05/13 09:00,2008/06/17 09:00,['2008/05/13 09:00'],"['2008/02/05 00:00 [received]', '2008/03/19 00:00 [revised]', '2008/03/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/05/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-2952(08)00193-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bcp.2008.03.017 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2008 Jun 15;75(12):2276-88. doi: 10.1016/j.bcp.2008.03.017.

Mesenchymal stem cells modulate immune responses in vitro and in vivo. We aimed to assess whether mesenchymal stem cells could ameliorate GVHD after haemopoietic-stem-cell transplantation. METHODS: Patients with steroid-resistant, severe, acute GVHD were treated with mesenchymal stem cells, derived with the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation ex-vivo expansion procedure, in a multicentre, phase II experimental study. We recorded response, transplantation-related deaths, and other adverse events for up to 60 months' follow-up from infusion of the cells. FINDINGS: Between October, 2001, and January, 2007, 55 patients were treated. The median dose of bone-marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells was 1.4x10(6) (min-max range 0.4-9x10(6)) cells per kg bodyweight. 27 patients received one dose, 22 received two doses, and six three to five doses of cells obtained from HLA-identical sibling donors (n=5), haploidentical donors (n=18), and third-party HLA-mismatched donors (n=69). 30 patients had a complete response and nine showed improvement. No patients had side-effects during or immediately after infusions of mesenchymal stem cells. Response rate was not related to donor HLA-match. Three patients had recurrent malignant disease and one developed de-novo acute myeloid leukaemia of recipient origin. Complete responders had lower transplantation-related mortality 1 year after infusion than did patients with partial or no response (11 [37%] of 30 vs 18 [72%] of 25; p=0.002) and higher overall survival 2 years after haemopoietic-stem-cell transplantation (16 [53%] of 30 vs four [16%] of 25; p=0.018). INTERPRETATION: Infusion of mesenchymal stem cells expanded in vitro, irrespective of the donor, might be an effective therapy for patients with steroid-resistant, acute GVHD.","['Le Blanc, Katarina', 'Frassoni, Francesco', 'Ball, Lynne', 'Locatelli, Franco', 'Roelofs, Helene', 'Lewis, Ian', 'Lanino, Edoardo', 'Sundberg, Berit', 'Bernardo, Maria Ester', 'Remberger, Mats', 'Dini, Giorgio', 'Egeler, R Maarten', 'Bacigalupo, Andrea', 'Fibbe, Willem', 'Ringden, Olle']","['Le Blanc K', 'Frassoni F', 'Ball L', 'Locatelli F', 'Roelofs H', 'Lewis I', 'Lanino E', 'Sundberg B', 'Bernardo ME', 'Remberger M', 'Dini G', 'Egeler RM', 'Bacigalupo A', 'Fibbe W', 'Ringden O']","['Haematology Centre and Centre of Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation, Division of Clinical Immunology, Karolinska University Hospital, Huddinge, Stockholm, Sweden. katarina.leblanc@ki.se']","['Developmental Committee of the European Group for Blood and Marrow', 'Transplantation']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Lancet,"Lancet (London, England)",2985213R,,IM,"['Adult', 'Child', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Graft vs Host Disease/classification/mortality/*therapy', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy', 'Male', '*Mesenchymal Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/therapy', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Survival Rate', 'Transplantation Conditioning/methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",2008/05/13 09:00,2008/05/23 09:00,['2008/05/13 09:00'],"['2008/05/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/23 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0140-6736(08)60690-X [pii]', '10.1016/S0140-6736(08)60690-X [doi]']",ppublish,Lancet. 2008 May 10;371(9624):1579-86. doi: 10.1016/S0140-6736(08)60690-X.,9624,,,,,,,,,,['Lancet. 2008 May 10;371(9624):1553-4.

There are a few data of fibrinolytic potential of neoplastic cells of hematopoietic system. The aim was the evaluation of t-PA (tissue plasminogen activator) and PAI-1 (inhibitor of plasminogen activator type 1) in lymphocytes datained from patients with chronic lymphoid leukemia. INVESTIGATED GROUP: The study was performed in 35 patients with chronic lymphoid leukemia and in control group containing 20 healthy persons. From venous blood lymphocytes were isolated, calculated and homogenized using ultrasound disintegrator. In homogenates of cells and in the blood plasma concentrations of t-PA antigen (t-PA:Ag) and antigen of PAI-1 (PAI-1:Ag) were determined. RESULTS: In lymphocytes obtained from healthy persons more t-PA and PAI-1 was detected than in lymphocytes from patients with chronic lymphoid leukemia. In lymphocytes from patients PAI-1: Ag concentration was 14 fold higher than t-PA:Ag. CONCLUSION: The lymphocytes of patients suffering from chronic lymphoid leukemia are different from healthy person in respect of t-PA:Ag and PAI-1:Ag concentration.","['Kowalewska, Anita', 'Rosc, Danuta', 'Szadziewska-Kowalska, Danuta', 'Goralczyk, Krzysztof']","['Kowalewska A', 'Rosc D', 'Szadziewska-Kowalska D', 'Goralczyk K']",['Katedra Patofizjologii Collegium Medicum w Bydgoszczy Uniwersytetu Mikolaja Kopernika w Toruniu Poradnia Hematologiczna przy Wojewodzkim Szpitalu im. dr J.

The Fv1 gene inhibits murine leukemia virus infection in mice, but the precise mechanism of Fv1-mediated restriction is poorly understood. Our previous studies had demonstrated that Fv1-mediated viral tropism can be determined within the capsid protein at position 114 (Jung and Kozak. 2000. J. Virol. 74: 5385-7). To study the interaction between Fv1 and CA, we introduced amino acid substitution and deletion at this site in the N-tropic AKV capsid gene. The mutated two-LTR proviral DNAs were introduced into SC-1 cells by transfection. After transfection, cell supernatants collected from transfected cells were tested for host range susceptibility. The result indicated that substitution of amino acids did not alter tropism, but the deletion of 114His produced a virus with unusual tropism. The novel phenotype produced here failed to replicate in Fv1-expressing cells. This mutant virus showing such an extreme restriction pattern would be useful for studying the mechanism of Fv1- mediated restriction.","['Bae, Eun Hye', 'Park, Sung-Han', 'Park, Sang Min', 'Park, Jin Woo', 'Lim, Mi Suk', 'Jung, Yong-Tae']","['Bae EH', 'Park SH', 'Park SM', 'Park JW', 'Lim MS', 'Jung YT']","['Department of Microbiology and Institute of Basic Science, Dankook University, Cheonan 330-714, Korea.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Korea (South),J Microbiol Biotechnol,Journal of microbiology and biotechnology,9431852,"['0 (Capsid Proteins)', '0 (Fv1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Proteins)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Substitution', 'Animals', 'Capsid Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Gene Products, gag/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Terminal Repeat Sequences', 'Transfection', '*Tropism', 'Virus Replication']",2008/05/10 09:00,2008/08/07 09:00,['2008/05/10 09:00'],"['2008/05/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/07 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/10 09:00 [entrez]']",['7227 [pii]'],ppublish,J Microbiol Biotechnol. 2008 Apr;18(4):799-804.,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The Children's Oncology Group AAML00P2 trial sought to define the MTD of GMTZ in combination with cytarabine and mitoxantrone and cytarabine and l-asparaginase chemotherapy regimens. RESULTS: The MTD for GMTZ in combination with cytarabine and mitoxantrone was 3 mg/m(2) while the MTD in combination with cytarabine and l-asparaginase was 2 mg/m(2). Toxicities observed in both treatment regimens were typical of those seen in the relapsed AML setting and consisted primarily of infectious complications. The overall remission response rate (mean +/- SE) was 45% +/- 15% and the 1 year event-free survival and overall survival estimates were 38% +/- 14% and 53% +/- 15%, respectively. CONCLUSION: This trial determined the pediatric MTD for GMTZ with two commonly used AML chemotherapy combinations. Based on these results, an ongoing phase III trial conducted within the Children's Oncology Group is evaluating the effect of GMTZ when added to standard AML therapy.","['Aplenc, Richard', 'Alonzo, Todd A', 'Gerbing, Robert B', 'Lange, Beverly J', 'Hurwitz, Craig A', 'Wells, Robert J', 'Bernstein, Irwin', 'Buckley, Patrick', 'Krimmel, Kathleen', 'Smith, Franklin O', 'Sievers, Eric L', 'Arceci, Robert J']","['Aplenc R', 'Alonzo TA', 'Gerbing RB', 'Lange BJ', 'Hurwitz CA', 'Wells RJ', 'Bernstein I', 'Buckley P', 'Krimmel K', 'Smith FO', 'Sievers EL', 'Arceci RJ']","[""Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Center for Clinical Epidemiology/Biostatistic, 3615 Civic Center Blvd, 916G ARC, Philadelphia, PA 19104-4318, USA. raplenc@mail.med.upenn.edu""]","[""Children's Oncology Group""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Aminoglycosides)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '93NS566KF7 (Gemtuzumab)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aminoglycosides/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Gemtuzumab', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Mitoxantrone/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Survival Rate']",2008/05/10 09:00,2008/05/28 09:00,['2008/05/10 09:00'],"['2008/05/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/28 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['26/14/2390 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2007.13.0096 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2008 May 10;26(14):2390-3295. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2007.13.0096.,14,,,"['R01 CA108862/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA098413/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1 R01 CA108862/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1 U10 CA98413-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC4558626,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because inactivation of p53 by deletion and/or mutations also impacts on the clinical course of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL), we assessed the role of the SNP309 genotype in B-CLL. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The frequency of SNP309 T/T, T/G, or G/G genotypes and the p53 status (wild type, mutated, or deleted) were assessed and correlated with clinical outcome in 140 B-CLL patients and a second independent cohort. In addition, the correlation of the MDM2 SNP309 genotype with the MDM2 protein expression level in B-CLL cells was evaluated by immunoblotting. RESULTS: A significant negative association of the SNP309 T/G and G/G genotypes with overall survival was seen (T/G genotype, relative risk = 3.7; 95% CI, 1.2 to 11.5; P = .02; G/G genotype, relative risk = 9.1; 95% CI, 2.4 to 35.1; P = .001), but no correlation with incidence or onset of B-CLL was observed. The influence of the heterozygous SNP309 T/G genotype on treatment-free survival depended on the p53 status but not on the CD38, Zap-70, or IgVH mutational status or Rai stage of B-CLL patients. The unfavorable SNP309 T/G and G/G genotypes were associated with a gene-dosage-dependent increase of MDM2 expression. CONCLUSION: The MDM2 SNP309 genotype influencing MDM2 expression levels was identified as an additional independent risk factor in B-CLL. Targeting MDM2-p53 interactions might emerge as a successful treatment strategy for B-CLL.","['Gryshchenko, Irina', 'Hofbauer, Sebastian', 'Stoecher, Markus', 'Daniel, Peter T', 'Steurer, Michael', 'Gaiger, Alexander', 'Eigenberger, Karin', 'Greil, Richard', 'Tinhofer, Inge']","['Gryshchenko I', 'Hofbauer S', 'Stoecher M', 'Daniel PT', 'Steurer M', 'Gaiger A', 'Eigenberger K', 'Greil R', 'Tinhofer I']","['Laboratory for Immunological and Molecular Cancer Research, Third Medical Department, Salzburg University Hospital, Muellner Hauptstrasse 48, A-5020 Salzburg, Austria.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (MDM2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (CD38 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Prognosis', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/metabolism', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase/biosynthesis/genetics']",2008/05/10 09:00,2008/05/28 09:00,['2008/05/10 09:00'],"['2008/05/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/28 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['26/14/2252 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2007.11.5212 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2008 May 10;26(14):2252-7. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2007.11.5212.,14,,,,,,,,,,['J Clin Oncol. 2008 May 10;26(14):2244-5.

To clarify the molecular mechanism underlying leukemogenesis after viral infection, we precisely mapped 605 chromosomal breakpoints in 61 ATLL cases by spectral karyotyping and identified frequent chromosomal breakpoints in 10p11, 14q11, and 14q32. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array-comparative genomic hybridization (CGH), genetic, and expression analyses of the genes mapped within a common breakpoint cluster region in 10p11.2 revealed that in ATLL cells, transcription factor 8 (TCF8) was frequently disrupted by several mechanisms, including mainly epigenetic dysregulation. TCF8 mutant mice frequently developed invasive CD4(+) T-cell lymphomas in the thymus or in ascitic fluid in vivo. Down-regulation of TCF8 expression in ATLL cells in vitro was associated with resistance to transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-beta1), a well-known characteristic of ATLL cells, suggesting that escape from TGF-beta1-mediated growth inhibition is important in the pathogenesis of ATLL.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We describe a cohort of seven patients and discuss 94 additional cases from the literature for whom biological parameters were described. Cases with incomplete data were excluded. RESULTS: Hodgkin's disease (HD) was more common in the 18-59 age group while breast and prostate cancers were prevalent only in the >or=18-year-old patients. The time interval to develop sALL was similar among all age groups but was significantly longer for HD and neuroblastoma primary diagnoses and sALL with complex karyotype. T-cell immunophenotype was more common in the <18 age group. Complete remission was infrequent in the >or=60 age group. The overall survival was poor for all sALL regardless of age, primary diagnoses, cytogenetic subgroups, or immunophenotype. Allogeneic transplantation most probably represents the only chance of cure. CONCLUSION: Better identification of prognostic factors to prevent the occurrence of sALL is indicated.","['Shivakumar, R', 'Tan, W', 'Wilding, G E', 'Wang, E S', 'Wetzler, M']","['Shivakumar R', 'Tan W', 'Wilding GE', 'Wang ES', 'Wetzler M']","['Leukemia Section, Department of Medicine, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Elm and Carlton Streets, Buffalo, NY 14263, USA.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Ann Oncol,Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology,9007735,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage', 'Biopsy, Needle', '*Cause of Death', 'Cohort Studies', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Hodgkin Disease/mortality/pathology/therapy', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/mortality/pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*mortality/pathology/*therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*mortality/pathology/*therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Factors', 'Sex Factors', 'Statistics, Nonparametric', 'Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",2008/05/10 09:00,2008/10/28 09:00,['2008/05/10 09:00'],"['2008/05/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/28 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0923-7534(19)40218-4 [pii]', '10.1093/annonc/mdn182 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Oncol. 2008 Sep;19(9):1634-8. doi: 10.1093/annonc/mdn182.

DESIGN: Secondary data analysis of longitudinal clinical trial data. SETTING: Outpatient clinic in a children's research hospital. SAMPLE: 149 female survivors (aged 12-18 years) a median of 11 years after diagnosis of leukemia or lymphoma (59%) or solid tumor (41%). METHODS: Paired t tests, Wilcoxon signed rank tests, repeated measures analysis of variance, and analysis of covariance. MAIN RESEARCH VARIABLES: BSE frequency, health risk perceptions, motivation, and fears or worries. FINDINGS: Baseline BSE frequency was the strongest influence on follow-up BSE. Baseline and follow-up age and school grade influenced follow-up BSE. Other influential variables included motivation for behavior change, motivation to commit to health promotion, concern about appearance, and an interaction between the intervention and mother's highest grade level. When baseline BSE frequency and school grade were statistically controlled, diagnosis and significant interactions between grade level and the follow-up measures of the mother's education, general fears about cancer, fears about cancer returning, and perceptions of susceptibility to late treatment effects were significant influences on BSE after intervention. CONCLUSIONS: Survivors least likely to perform BSE are fearful about cancer and are not motivated to change health behaviors. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING: Nurses should explore survivors' fears about cancer and late treatment effects to address misconceptions, use modeling techniques with return demonstrations to ensure competency in BSE, and tailor risk information to each survivor's background (socio-economic status, age, development) and cognitive (disease and treatment knowledge, risks) and affective (fears) characteristics to increase BSE motivation.","['Cox, Cheryl L', 'Montgomery, Michele', 'Rai, Shesh N', 'McLaughlin, Rosemary', 'Steen, Brenda D', 'Hudson, Melissa M']","['Cox CL', 'Montgomery M', 'Rai SN', 'McLaughlin R', 'Steen BD', 'Hudson MM']","[""Department of Epidemiology and Cancer Control, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA. cheryl.cox@stjude.org""]",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Oncol Nurs Forum,Oncology nursing forum,7809033,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adolescent Behavior/psychology', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Breast Self-Examination/nursing/*psychology', 'Fear', 'Female', 'Health Behavior', 'Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice', 'Health Promotion', 'Humans', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Motivation', 'Needs Assessment/*organization & administration', 'Neoplasms/prevention & control/*psychology', 'Nursing Assessment', 'Nursing Methodology Research', 'Oncology Nursing/*methods', 'Patient Compliance/*psychology', 'Patient Education as Topic', 'Risk Assessment', 'Social Support', 'Statistics, Nonparametric', 'Survivors/*psychology']",2008/05/10 09:00,2008/06/27 09:00,['2008/05/10 09:00'],"['2008/05/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/27 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['Y7L63J7PP344T604 [pii]', '10.1188/08.ONF.423-430 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncol Nurs Forum. 2008 May;35(3):423-30. doi: 10.1188/08.ONF.423-430.,3,,,['R03 NR008733/NR/NINR NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the dose of ATO required to suppress gliomas is markedly higher than that used to treat APL, which leads to toxicity and undesirable side-effects, even though the local concentration of ATO in brains is relatively low after systemic administration. In an attempt to minimize the toxicity, enhance the penetrating activity across the blood-brain barrier, and reduce enzyme degradation, we prepared ATO encapsulated in liposomes, and investigated its therapeutic effect on C6 gliomas established in rat brains. The prepared ATO liposomes were stable at room temperature for 3 days and the latency rate was over 90% within 72 h. Intravenous injection of ATO liposomes led to a much higher concentration of ATO (5- fold, compared with ATO solution) in rat brains, resulting in inhibition of C6 gliomas in brains and prolonging the survival of rats bearing brain gliomas. ATO-liposome therapy resulted in fewer side effects, compared with free ATO solution. ATO-liposome therapy inhibited tumor angiogenesis by downregulating the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and inducing cell apoptosis. The results warrant future investigation of the use of ATO encapsulated in liposomes to treat gliomas.","['Zhao, Shiguang', 'Zhang, Xu', 'Zhang, Jian', 'Zhang, Jianhua', 'Zou, Huichao', 'Liu, Yaohua', 'Dong, Xuesong', 'Sun, Xueying']","['Zhao S', 'Zhang X', 'Zhang J', 'Zhang J', 'Zou H', 'Liu Y', 'Dong X', 'Sun X']","['Department of Neurosurgery, First Clinical Medical School of Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Chemother,"Journal of chemotherapy (Florence, Italy)",8907348,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Liposomes)', '0 (Oxides)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Blotting, Western', 'Brain Neoplasms/blood supply/*drug therapy', 'Drug Stability', 'Glioma/blood supply/*drug therapy', 'Injections, Intravenous', 'Liposomes', 'Male', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic/drug therapy', 'Oxides/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Tissue Distribution']",2008/05/10 09:00,2008/07/22 09:00,['2008/05/10 09:00'],"['2008/05/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/22 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/10 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1179/joc.2008.20.2.253 [doi]'],ppublish,J Chemother. 2008 Apr;20(2):253-62. doi: 10.1179/joc.2008.20.2.253.,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many types of genetic alterations have been identified in myeloid diseases. However, the mechanism(s) by which these cells acquire genetic alterations or ""Genomic instability"", is less well understood. Increasing evidence suggests that the genetic changes in myeloid malignancies lead to increased production of endogenous sources of DNA damage, such as, reactive oxygen species (ROS). The fusion gene BCR-ABL in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), FLT3/ITD in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and RAS mutations in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS)/myeloproliferative diseases (MPD) result in ROS production. Increased ROS can drive a cycle of genomic instability leading to DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) and altered repair that can lead to acquisition of genomic changes. Evidence is coming to light that defects in a main repair pathway for DSBs, non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ), lead to up-regulation of alternative or ""back-up"" repair that can create chromosomal deletions and translocations. This article will review evidence for activation of RAS/PI3K/STAT pathways, that lead to increased ROS, DNA damage and defective repair in myeloid diseases, a mechanism for acquisition of additional mutations that can drive disease progression.","['Sallmyr, Annahita', 'Fan, Jinshui', 'Rassool, Feyruz Virgilia']","['Sallmyr A', 'Fan J', 'Rassool FV']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21201, USA.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Ireland,Cancer Lett,Cancer letters,7600053,"['0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (STAT Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['*DNA Breaks, Double-Stranded', '*DNA Repair', 'Genes, abl/physiology', '*Genomic Instability', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/metabolism', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/physiology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/physiology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'STAT Transcription Factors/physiology', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/physiology']",2008/05/10 09:00,2008/10/15 09:00,['2008/05/10 09:00'],"['2008/01/17 00:00 [received]', '2008/03/25 00:00 [revised]', '2008/03/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/05/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/15 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0304-3835(08)00246-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.canlet.2008.03.036 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Lett. 2008 Oct 18;270(1):1-9. doi: 10.1016/j.canlet.2008.03.036.

Higher hydrophobicity of the derivatives improves their penetration into cells, where upon reaction with glutathione, S-allylthioglutathione (GSSA) is formed, and 6-MP or 6-MPR is released for further processing.","['Miron, T', 'Arditti, F', 'Konstantinovski, L', 'Rabinkov, A', 'Mirelman, D', 'Berrebi, A', 'Wilchek, M']","['Miron T', 'Arditti F', 'Konstantinovski L', 'Rabinkov A', 'Mirelman D', 'Berrebi A', 'Wilchek M']","['Department of Biological Chemistry, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot 76100, Israel. talia.miron@weizmann.ac.il']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],France,Eur J Med Chem,European journal of medicinal chemistry,0420510,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Prodrugs)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*chemical synthesis/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'Mercaptopurine/*chemical synthesis/pharmacology', 'Prodrugs/chemical synthesis', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",2008/05/10 09:00,2009/05/08 09:00,['2008/05/10 09:00'],"['2007/11/25 00:00 [received]', '2008/03/26 00:00 [revised]', '2008/03/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/05/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/08 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0223-5234(08)00177-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ejmech.2008.03.027 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Med Chem. 2009 Feb;44(2):541-50. doi: 10.1016/j.ejmech.2008.03.027.

Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-negative infectious donor blood can be identified by sensitive nucleic acid testing (NAT). Two immunodeficient patients who received blood components from a single seronegative blood donor subsequently found to contain HBV DNA are described. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Multiple samples from the implicated donor and the two recipients were tested for HBV serologic and molecular markers. HBV genome fragments were amplified, sequenced, and phylogenetically analyzed. RESULTS: The implicated donation had low-level HBV DNA due to the donor being in the window period before the donor's seroconversion. Recipient 1 had been vaccinated to HBV and carried anti-HBs but remained negative for all other HBV markers until she developed acute hepatitis B (viral load 2.7 x 10(8) IU/mL and alanine aminotransferase [ALT] level 1744 IU/L) 13 months after transfusion of red cells. Identical HBV sequences from both donor and recipient provided evidence of transfusion-related infection. Recipient 2, who received platelets from the same donation while receiving major chemotherapy, remained uninfected. CONCLUSIONS: In unusual circumstances, HBV incubation time can be considerably prolonged. Both active and passive neutralizing antibodies to HBV likely delayed, but did not prevent, acute infection when the immune system was impaired. HBV NAT may have interdicted the infectious unit, although the donation viral load could not be quantified and odds of detection calculated.","['Wendel, Silvano', 'Levi, Jose E', 'Biagini, Silvana', 'Candotti, Daniel', 'Allain, Jean-Pierre']","['Wendel S', 'Levi JE', 'Biagini S', 'Candotti D', 'Allain JP']","['Blood Bank, Hospital Sirio Libanes, Sao Paulo, Brazil. snwendel@uninet.com.br']",,['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Transfusion,Transfusion,0417360,"['0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Blood Donors', 'Child', 'DNA, Viral/blood', 'Female', 'Hepatitis B/*etiology/*transmission', 'Hepatitis B virus/genetics/*isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*therapy', 'Time Factors', '*Transfusion Reaction']",2008/05/10 09:00,2008/10/01 09:00,['2008/05/10 09:00'],"['2008/05/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/01 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['TRF01723 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1537-2995.2008.01723.x [doi]']",ppublish,Transfusion. 2008 Aug;48(8):1602-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1537-2995.2008.01723.x.

The interpretation of immunophenotyping results by flow cytometry involves pattern recognition of different hematologic neoplasms that may have similar immunologic marker profiles. An important factor that creates difficulty in the interpretation process is the lack of consistency in marker expression for a particular neoplasm. For this reason, a definitive diagnostic pattern is usually not available for each specific neoplasm. Consequently, there is a need for decision support tools to assist pathology trainees in learning flow cytometric diagnosis of leukemia and lymphoma. OBJECTIVE: Development of a Web-enabled relational database integrated with decision-making tools for teaching flow cytometric diagnosis of hematologic neoplasms. DESIGN: This database has a knowledge base containing patterns of 44 markers for 37 hematologic neoplasms. We have obtained immunophenotyping data published in the scientific literature and incorporated them into a mathematical algorithm that is integrated to the database for differential diagnostic purposes. The algorithm takes into account the incidence of positive and negative expression of each marker for each disorder. RESULTS: Validation of this algorithm was performed using 92 clinical cases accumulated from 2 different medical centers. The database also incorporates the latest World Health Organization classification for hematologic neoplasms. CONCLUSIONS: The algorithm developed in this database shows significant improvement in diagnostic accuracy over our previous database prototype. This Web-based database is proposed to be a useful public resource for teaching pathology trainees flow cytometric diagnosis.","['Nguyen, Andy N D', 'De, Jitakshi', 'Nguyen, Jacqueline', 'Padula, Anthony', 'Qu, Zhenhong']","['Nguyen AN', 'De J', 'Nguyen J', 'Padula A', 'Qu Z']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, Houston, TX 77030, USA.

OBJECTIVE: To establish a comprehensive immunophenotypic spectrum of normal basophils and to assess the range of immunophenotypic aberrations of basophils in chronic myelogenous leukemia. DESIGN: Using 4-color flow cytometry, we compared the immunophenotypic profile of basophils in peripheral blood or bone marrow samples from 20 patients with no evidence of neoplasia to basophils from 15 patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia. RESULTS: Basophils in control cases were all positive for CD9, CD13, CD22, CD25 (dim), CD33, CD36, CD38 (bright), CD45 (dimmer than lymphocytes and brighter than myeloblasts), and CD123 (bright), and were negative for CD19, CD34, CD64, CD117, and HLA-DR. Basophils in all chronic myelogenous leukemia patients possessed 1 to 5 immunophenotypic aberrancies. The most common aberrancies were underexpression of CD38, followed by aberrant expression of CD64 and underexpression of CD123. CD34 and CD117 were present in cases with basophilic precursors. Myeloblasts showed a distinct immunophenotypic profile, as they typically expressed CD34 and CD117, showed dimmer expression (compared with basophils) of CD38, CD45, and CD123, and lacked expression of CD22. CONCLUSIONS: Flow cytometric immunophenotyping can identify immunophenotypic aberrations of basophils in chronic myelogenous leukemia, and discriminate basophils from myeloblasts.","['Han, Xiaohong', 'Jorgensen, Jeffrey L', 'Brahmandam, Archana', 'Schlette, Ellen', 'Huh, Yang O', 'Shi, Yuankai', 'Awagu, Sylvester', 'Chen, Weina']","['Han X', 'Jorgensen JL', 'Brahmandam A', 'Schlette E', 'Huh YO', 'Shi Y', 'Awagu S', 'Chen W']","['Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas M.

The expression of Zap70 may reflect the specific cell of origin of the tumor or may contribute to pathology. Thus, the normal role of Zap70 in B cell physiology is of great interest. While initial studies reported that Zap70 expression in the mouse was limited to T and NK cells, more recent work has shown expression in early B cell progenitors and in splenic B cells, suggesting that the kinase may play a role in the development or activation of B cells. In this study, we show that Zap70 is expressed in all developing subsets of B cells as well as in recirculating B cells, marginal zone B cells and peritoneal B1 cells. Analysis of Zap70-deficient mice shows no unique role for Zap70 in either the development of B cells or in their in vitro and in vivo activation. However, we show that Zap70 can rescue the defective positive selection of immature B cells into the recirculating pool in Syk-deficient mice, demonstrating functional redundancy between these two kinases.","['Fallah-Arani, Farnaz', 'Schweighoffer, Edina', 'Vanes, Lesley', 'Tybulewicz, Victor L J']","['Fallah-Arani F', 'Schweighoffer E', 'Vanes L', 'Tybulewicz VL']","['Division of Immune Cell Biology, MRC National Institute for Medical Research, London, UK.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Eur J Immunol,European journal of immunology,1273201,"['0 (Haptens)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '0 (trinitrophenyl keyhole limpet hemocyanin)', '9013-72-3 (Hemocyanins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (SYK protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Syk Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Syk protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Zap70 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocyte Subsets/cytology/metabolism', 'B-Lymphocytes/cytology/*metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Calcium Signaling/physiology', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Haptens', 'Hemocyanins/immunology', 'Immunoblotting', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/deficiency/genetics/metabolism', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, Mutant Strains', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Peritoneal Cavity/cytology', 'Precursor Cells, B-Lymphoid/cytology/metabolism', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/deficiency/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/physiology', 'Spleen/cytology/immunology', 'Syk Kinase', 'Vaccination', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism']",2008/05/10 09:00,2008/08/19 09:00,['2008/05/10 09:00'],"['2008/05/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/19 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/10 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/eji.200738026 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Immunol. 2008 Jun;38(6):1721-33. doi: 10.1002/eji.200738026.,6,,,['MC_U117527252/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In preclinical studies, omacetaxine mepesuccinate induced apoptosis in leukemia cell lines. Results from phase II clinical trials revealed omacetaxine mepesuccinate to be active in patients with CML that was resistant to tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy, including those patients who carry the BCR-ABL1T315I mutation, which is highly insensitive to the TKIs imatinib, nilotinib and dasatinib; the therapeutic was also generally well tolerated.

Flavopiridol, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, arrests cell division and causes apoptosis in non-small lung cancer cells [283660]. A phase II trial, in collaboration with the National Cancer Institute, has commenced at the University of Chicago Medical Center, which involves patients with high or intermediate-grade lymphoma or multiple myeloma [272937], [277372]. In ex vivo experiments with tumor cells from refractory chronic lymphoblastic leukemia, dose-dependent CDK2 inhibition associated with apoptotic changes was seen at concentrations greater than 100 nM of flavopiridol. In vitro pharmacokinetic studies have shown that flavopiridol undergoes hepatic biotransformation to its corresponding glucoronide by uridine diphosphate glucoronosyltransferases [283791]. Flavopiridol inhibits CDK with an IC50 value of 0.4 mM [285707].

The list of cancers at increased risk of development in an ""obesogenic"" environment include common adult cancers such as endometrium, post-menopausal breast, colon and kidney, but also less common malignancies such as leukaemia, multiple myeloma, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The pathophysiological and biological mechanisms underpinning these associations are only starting to be understood. Insulin resistance is at the heart of many, but there are several other candidate systems including insulin-like growth factors, sex steroids, adipokines, obesity-related inflammatory markers, the nuclear factor kappa beta (NF-kappa B) system and oxidative stresses. With such as diversity of obesity-related cancers, it is unlikely that there is a ""one system fits all"" mechanism. While public health strategies to curb the spread of the obesity epidemic appear ineffective, there is a need to better understand the processes linking obesity and cancer as a pre-requisite to the development of new approaches to the prevention and treatment of obesity-related cancers.","['Renehan, Andrew G', 'Roberts, Darren L', 'Dive, Caroline']","['Renehan AG', 'Roberts DL', 'Dive C']","['Department of Surgery, School of Cancer and Imaging Sciences, University of Manchester, Christie Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, Wilmslow Road, Manchester, UK. arenehan@picr.man.ac.uk']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Arch Physiol Biochem,Archives of physiology and biochemistry,9510153,"['0 (Adipokines)', '0 (Hormones)', '0 (Insulin)', '0 (Somatomedins)']",IM,"['Adipokines/metabolism', 'Hormones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Insulin/metabolism', 'Neoplasms/*complications/epidemiology/*metabolism/mortality', 'Obesity/*complications/metabolism/*physiopathology', 'Somatomedins/metabolism']",2008/05/10 09:00,2008/09/06 09:00,['2008/05/10 09:00'],"['2008/05/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/06 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['791511691 [pii]', '10.1080/13813450801954303 [doi]']",ppublish,Arch Physiol Biochem. 2008 Feb;114(1):71-83. doi: 10.1080/13813450801954303.,1,133,,['Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Among 53 418 patients registered by the population based Danish Breast Cancer Cooperative Group (DBCG) during 1977-2001, 31 818 patients were treated and followed according to guidelines of DBCG. In addition to surgery 23% received tamoxifen, 23% chemotherapy and 35% radiotherapy as treatment for primary breast cancer. Second primary cancers were identified by linkage to the population based Danish Cancer Register. Cancer incidence rates of the Danish population were used for calculation of standardized incidence ratios (SIRs). Time at risk was from diagnosis of breast cancer+1 year until death or through 2002. Risk for all second primary cancers combined was increased, SIR=1.04 (95% confidence interval 0.99-1.08). Sites with significantly elevated risks included corpus uteri (SIR=1.23), ovary (1.39), soft tissues (2.24), acute leukaemia (2.02), and sites potentially inducible by breast cancer radiotherapy combined (1.11). For irradiated patients compared to non-irradiated the risk was increased for all sited combined, radiotherapy-related sites, colon and soft tissues. Tamoxifen treated had, compared to non-treated, elevated risk for cancer of corpus uteri (SIR=1.83 vs 1.04). Patients given adjuvant chemotherapy had, compared to those not, elevated risks for all sites combined (SIR=1.24 vs 1.01) and for ovary (2.16 vs 1.24). Risk for cancer of the lung, uterus and ovary was analysed using multivariate Poisson regression. For lung cancer the risk was related to radiotherapy and time since diagnosis, the relative risk for lung cancer being 1.33 (95% CI 1.00-1.77) (irradiated vs non-irradiated). Ovary cancer risk was inversely related to age at diagnosis but not to treatment and corpus uteri cancer risk related to tamoxifen treatment, relative risk 1.57.

We conducted a focused cytogenetic study in an HL60 cell line, by analyzing GTG-banded chromosomes before and after treatment with pisosterol (at 0.5, 1.0, and 1.8 microg/ml), a triterpene isolated from Pisolithus tinctorius, a fungus collected in the Northeast of Brazil. Before treatment, 99% of the cells showed the homogeneously staining region (HSR) 8q24 aberration. After treatment with 1.8 microg/ml pisosterol, 90% of the analyzed cells lacked this aberration. We further performed a pulse test, in which the cells treated with pisosterol (0.5, 1.0, and 1.8 microg/ml) were washed and re-incubated in the absence of pisosterol. Only 30% of the analyzed cells lacked the HSR 8q24 aberration, suggesting that pisosterol probably blocks the cells with HSRs at interphase. No effects were detected at lower concentrations. At the highest concentration examined (1.8 microg/ml), pisosterol also inhibited cell growth, but this effect was not observed in the pulse test, reinforcing our hypothesis that, at the concentrations tested, pisosterol probably does not induce cell death in the HL60 line. The results found for pisosterol were compared with those for doxorubicin. Cells that do not show a high degree of gene amplification (HSRs and double-minute chromosomes) have a less aggressive and invasive behavior and are easy targets for chemotherapy. Therefore, further studies are needed to examine the use of pisosterol in combination with conventional anti-cancer therapy.","['Burbano, R R', 'Lima, P D L', 'Bahia, M O', 'Khayat, A S', 'Silva, T C R', 'Bezerra, F S', 'Andrade Neto, M', 'de Moraes, M O', 'Montenegro, R C', 'Costa-Lotufo, L V', 'Pessoa, C']","['Burbano RR', 'Lima PD', 'Bahia MO', 'Khayat AS', 'Silva TC', 'Bezerra FS', 'Andrade Neto M', 'de Moraes MO', 'Montenegro RC', 'Costa-Lotufo LV', 'Pessoa C']","['Human Cytogenetics Laboratory, Institute of Biological Sciences, Federal University of Para, Campus Universitario do Guama, Para, Brazil. rommel@ufpa.br']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Cell Biol Toxicol,Cell biology and toxicology,8506639,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Terpenes)', '0 (pisosterol)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*toxicity', 'Basidiomycota/*chemistry', 'Cell Cycle/*drug effects', 'Chromosome Aberrations/drug effects', 'Chromosome Banding', 'Doxorubicin/toxicity', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Gene Amplification/*drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells/*drug effects/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Mitotic Index', 'Plant Extracts/toxicity', 'Terpenes/*toxicity']",2008/05/10 09:00,2009/07/01 09:00,['2008/05/10 09:00'],"['2007/12/26 00:00 [received]', '2008/03/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/05/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/01 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/10 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s10565-008-9074-x [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Biol Toxicol. 2009 Jun;25(3):245-51. doi: 10.1007/s10565-008-9074-x.

Treatment was continued in her parent hospital, where after a few months her sputum became negative for M. avium. But she died over a year later from progressive respiratory insufficiency in the course of bronchiolitis obliterans.

Although further evaluation with human clinical materials are required, these results propose a putative role of Ik6 in the development of B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia, by activating the JAK2-STAT5 pathway and thus stimulating the production of Bcl-xl.","['Kano, Gen', 'Morimoto, Akira', 'Takanashi, Mami', 'Hibi, Shigeyoshi', 'Sugimoto, Tohru', 'Inaba, Tohru', 'Yagi, Tomohito', 'Imashuku, Shinsaku']","['Kano G', 'Morimoto A', 'Takanashi M', 'Hibi S', 'Sugimoto T', 'Inaba T', 'Yagi T', 'Imashuku S']","['Department of Paediatrics, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, Japan.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Bcl2l1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '148971-36-2 (Ikaros Transcription Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Jak2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival', 'Humans', 'Ikaros Transcription Factor/genetics/*physiology', 'Interleukin-3', 'Janus Kinase 2/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*etiology', 'Precursor Cells, B-Lymphoid/*cytology', 'Protein Isoforms/physiology', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/*metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Up-Regulation', 'bcl-X Protein/*biosynthesis']",2008/05/09 09:00,2008/08/14 09:00,['2008/05/09 09:00'],"['2008/05/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/14 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/09 09:00 [entrez]']","['792942741 [pii]', '10.1080/10428190801993462 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2008 May;49(5):965-73. doi: 10.1080/10428190801993462.,5,,,,,,,,,,['Leuk Lymphoma. 2008 May;49(5):847-9.

To investigate its prevalence in Chinese patients with MPD, we introduced allele-specific PCR (AS-PCR) combined with sequence analysis to simultaneously screen MPL W515L and JAK2 V617F mutations in 190 MPD patients. MPL W515L mutation was found to be harbored in only one of 102 patients, who had essential thrombocythemia (ET, 1.0%) and was not detected in patients with polycythemia vera (PV), idiopathic myelofibrosis (IMF), and chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). Sixty-eight BCR/ABL-negative MPD patients (46.3%) were found harboring JAK2 V617F mutation (PV, 62.5%; ET, 42.1%; IMF 38.1%). Furthermore, MPL W515L and JAK2 V617F mutations were not detected in patients of acute myeloid leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, myelodysplastic syndromes, and CML.

Active transport across membranes is essential for such cellular drug resistance, largely provided by ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transport proteins. Intracellular drug sequestration contributes to MDR; however, a genuine intracellular ABC transport protein with MDR function has not yet been identified. Analyzing the intrinsic drug efflux capacity of leukemic stem cells, we found the ABC transporter A3 (ABCA3) to be expressed consistently in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) samples. Greater expression of ABCA3 is associated with unfavorable treatment outcome, and in vitro, elevated expression induces resistance toward a broad spectrum of cytostatic agents.

The main challenges in cancer biology are to identify cancer stem cells and to define the molecular events required for transforming normal cells to cancer stem cells. Here we show that Pten deletion in mouse haematopoietic stem cells leads to a myeloproliferative disorder, followed by acute T-lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL). Self-renewable leukaemia stem cells (LSCs) are enriched in the c-Kit(mid)CD3(+)Lin(-) compartment, where unphosphorylated beta-catenin is significantly increased. Conditional ablation of one allele of the beta-catenin gene substantially decreases the incidence and delays the occurrence of T-ALL caused by Pten loss, indicating that activation of the beta-catenin pathway may contribute to the formation or expansion of the LSC population. Moreover, a recurring chromosomal translocation, T(14;15), results in aberrant overexpression of the c-myc oncogene in c-Kit(mid)CD3(+)Lin(-) LSCs and CD3(+) leukaemic blasts, recapitulating a subset of human T-ALL. No alterations in Notch1 signalling are detected in this model, suggesting that Pten inactivation and c-myc overexpression may substitute functionally for Notch1 abnormalities, leading to T-ALL development. Our study indicates that multiple genetic or molecular alterations contribute cooperatively to LSC transformation.","['Guo, Wei', 'Lasky, Joseph L', 'Chang, Chun-Ju', 'Mosessian, Sherly', 'Lewis, Xiaoman', 'Xiao, Yun', 'Yeh, Jennifer E', 'Chen, James Y', 'Iruela-Arispe, M Luisa', 'Varella-Garcia, Marileila', 'Wu, Hong']","['Guo W', 'Lasky JL', 'Chang CJ', 'Mosessian S', 'Lewis X', 'Xiao Y', 'Yeh JE', 'Chen JY', 'Iruela-Arispe ML', 'Varella-Garcia M', 'Wu H']","['Department of Molecular and Medical Pharmacology, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California 90095, USA.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Nature,Nature,0410462,"['0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (beta Catenin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN Phosphohydrolase)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (Pten protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CD3 Complex/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Chromosomes, Mammalian/genetics', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/pathology', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*metabolism/*pathology', 'PTEN Phosphohydrolase/*deficiency/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'beta Catenin/metabolism']",2008/05/09 09:00,2008/07/08 09:00,['2008/05/09 09:00'],"['2007/10/30 00:00 [received]', '2008/03/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/05/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/08 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/09 09:00 [entrez]']","['nature06933 [pii]', '10.1038/nature06933 [doi]']",ppublish,Nature. 2008 May 22;453(7194):529-33. doi: 10.1038/nature06933.

Their efficacy in the tumor environment increases when tumor cells die as a consequence of chemo/radiotherapy or when local stimuli promoting DC maturation and function are available. Dying tumor cells could represent a source of tumor antigens, which DCs cross-present to tumor-specific T cells. The outcome of cross presentation is in turn determined by the maturation state of DCs. Natural killer (NK)/lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells injected into growing tumors could both provide a source of dying cells for cross-presentation and deliver stimuli for DC maturation. Here, we report that NK/LAK cells recognized and killed in vivo major histocompatibility complex class I(low) highly tumorigenic, nonimmunogenic B16F1 melanoma cells when injected into exponentially growing neoplastic lesions. The simultaneous injection of immature DCs was required to heal animals. Similar results were obtained injecting NK/LAK cells and DC into growing Raucher leukaemia virus induced cell line lymphomas. Cured mice failed to reject other implantable tumors, and developed a specific cytotoxic response against the original neoplasm; moreover, they developed a long-lasting memory, and were protected against further challenges with living tumor cells only when both cell populations were introduced.

SUMMARY: An 84-year-old Caucasian woman with a history of osteoarthritis sought medical attention for relapse of her APL, which had initially been diagnosed approximately 30 months earlier. Complete remission was accomplished with three cycles of i.v. daunorubicin for 3 days and oral tretinoin for 28 days. After 19 months in remission, she was noted to have increased bruising and blood test values consistent with APL relapse. Two additional trials of oral tretinoin were unsuccessful, and arsenic trioxide was initiated at a daily dosage of 0.15 mg/kg of actual body weight. Less than 24 hours after receiving arsenic trioxide, the patient had ""bile-like emesis"" and her hemoglobin level decreased. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding was suspected and managed aggressively with transfusions of platelets and fresh frozen plasma and i.v. desmopressin. She became anuric, and her serum creatinine level more than doubled. Hemodialysis was started due to a sudden increase in potassium and fluid overload that did not respond to i.v. furosemide. One hour after hemodialysis, the patient was found pulseless and unresponsive by nursing staff. The cardiac arrest team rapidly responded and noted atrial fibrillation with a fast ventricular rate.

Histone deacetylase (HDAC) 7 is a potent corepressor that inhibits transcription by myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2) transcription factors. We show here that endogenous HDAC7 and PML interact and partially colocalize in PML NBs. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha treatment recruits HDAC7 to PML NBs and enhances association of HDAC7 with PML in human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Consequently, TNF-alpha promotes dissociation of HDAC7 from MEF2 transcription factors and the promoters of MEF2 target genes such as matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-10, leading to accumulation of MMP-10 mRNA. Conversely, knockdown of PML enhances the association between HDAC7 and MEF2 and decreases MMP-10 mRNA accumulation. Accordingly, ectopic expression of PML recruits HDAC7 to PML NBs and leads to activation of MEF2 reporter activity. Notably, small interfering RNA knockdown of PML decreases basal and TNF-alpha-induced MMP-10 mRNA accumulation. Our results reveal a novel mechanism by which PML sequesters HDAC7 to relieve repression and up-regulate gene expression.","['Gao, Chengzhuo', 'Cheng, Xiwen', 'Lam, Minh', 'Liu, Yu', 'Liu, Qing', 'Chang, Kun-Sang', 'Kao, Hung-Ying']","['Gao C', 'Cheng X', 'Lam M', 'Liu Y', 'Liu Q', 'Chang KS', 'Kao HY']","['Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH 44106, USA.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Biol Cell,Molecular biology of the cell,9201390,"['0 (MEF2 Transcription Factors)', '0 (Myogenic Regulatory Factors)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', 'EC 3.4.24.22 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 10)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (HDAC7 protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Hdac7 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', 'HeLa Cells', 'Histone Deacetylases/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Intranuclear Inclusion Bodies/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*metabolism', 'MEF2 Transcription Factors', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 10/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Myogenic Regulatory Factors/metabolism', 'Protein Interaction Mapping', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/metabolism']",2008/05/09 09:00,2009/02/26 09:00,['2008/05/09 09:00'],"['2008/05/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/02/26 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/09 09:00 [entrez]']","['E07-11-1203 [pii]', '10.1091/mbc.e07-11-1203 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Biol Cell. 2008 Jul;19(7):3020-7. doi: 10.1091/mbc.e07-11-1203.

While plant-based formulations have been used to treat cancer for centuries, current treatments usually involve poisonous mustard gas, chemotherapy, radiation, and targeted therapies. While traditional plant-derived medicines are safe, what are the active principles in them and how do they mediate their effects against cancer is perhaps best illustrated by curcumin, a derivative of turmeric used for centuries to treat a wide variety of inflammatory conditions. Curcumin is a diferuloylmethane derived from the Indian spice, turmeric (popularly called ""curry powder"") that has been shown to interfere with multiple cell signaling pathways, including cell cycle (cyclin D1 and cyclin E), apoptosis (activation of caspases and down-regulation of antiapoptotic gene products), proliferation (HER-2, EGFR, and AP-1), survival (PI3K/AKT pathway), invasion (MMP-9 and adhesion molecules), angiogenesis (VEGF), metastasis (CXCR-4) and inflammation (NF-kappaB, TNF, IL-6, IL-1, COX-2, and 5-LOX). The activity of curcumin reported against leukemia and lymphoma, gastrointestinal cancers, genitourinary cancers, breast cancer, ovarian cancer, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, lung cancer, melanoma, neurological cancers, and sarcoma reflects its ability to affect multiple targets.

It is believed that cytotoxic lymphocytes are important effectors in this process. PKCtheta plays an essential role in proliferation, activation and survival of these cells, but also proliferation and survival of leukemic T cells. In light of this, we tested the role of PKCtheta in T cell leukemia progression by inducing this disease in wild-type (wt) and PKCtheta-deficient mice with moloney-murine leukemia virus (M-MuLV). Leukemic PKCtheta(-/-) and wild-type (wt) mice showed the same profile of leukemic cell types, similar spleen and thymus sizes and comparable hematocrits. In contrast, disease incidence was higher and disease onset more rapid in PKCtheta(-/-) mice. Transfer of leukemic T cells from wt donors into PKCtheta-deficient and wt recipients induced leukemia in 100% and 40% of the mice, respectively. Interestingly, leukemic cells from PKCtheta(-/-) donors induced the disease in only 50% of the PKCtheta-deficient and 10% of the wt recipients. Intravenous injection of low numbers of EL4 cells induced tumors earlier in PKCtheta(-/-) mice. Taken together, our results show that PKCtheta is essential for the immune response to leukemia in mice and raise questions about the chronic treatment of humans with PKCtheta inhibitors.","['Garaude, Johan', 'Kaminski, Sandra', 'Charni, Seyma', 'Aguilo, Juan Ignacio', 'Jacquet, Chantal', 'Plays, Marc', 'Hernandez, Javier', 'Rodriguez, Fernando', 'Hipskind, Robert A', 'Anel, Alberto', 'Villalba, Martin']","['Garaude J', 'Kaminski S', 'Charni S', 'Aguilo JI', 'Jacquet C', 'Plays M', 'Hernandez J', 'Rodriguez F', 'Hipskind RA', 'Anel A', 'Villalba M']","['Institut de Genetique Moleculaire de Montpellier, CNRS UMR 5535, IFR 122, 1919 Route de Mende, 34293 Montpellier, France.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Mol Immunol,Molecular immunology,7905289,"['0 (Isoenzymes)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Prkcq protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C-theta)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Isoenzymes/*deficiency/metabolism', 'Leukemia/*enzymology/*immunology/pathology/virology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Phenotype', 'Protein Kinase C/*deficiency/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase C-theta', 'Survival Analysis']",2008/05/09 09:00,2008/09/03 09:00,['2008/05/09 09:00'],"['2008/02/25 00:00 [received]', '2008/03/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/05/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/03 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/09 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0161-5890(08)00137-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.molimm.2008.03.016 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Immunol. 2008 Jul;45(12):3463-9. doi: 10.1016/j.molimm.2008.03.016.

Here, we demonstrate that conditional inactivation of the Pbx1 proto-oncogene in the hematopoietic compartment results in a progressive loss of long-term hematopoietic stem cells (LT-HSCs) that is associated with concomitant reduction in their quiescence, leading to a defect in the maintenance of self-renewal as assessed by serial transplantation. Transcriptional profiling revealed that multiple stem cell maintenance factors are perturbed in Pbx1-deficient LT-HSCs, which prematurely express a large subset of genes, including cell-cycle regulators, normally expressed in non-self-renewing multipotent progenitors. A significant proportion of Pbx1-dependent genes is associated with the TGF-beta pathway, which serves a major role in maintaining HSC quiescence. Prospectively isolated, Pbx1-deficient LT-HSCs display altered transcriptional responses to TGF-beta stimulation in vitro, suggesting a possible mechanism through which Pbx1 maintenance of stem cell quiescence may in part be achieved.","['Ficara, Francesca', 'Murphy, Mark J', 'Lin, Min', 'Cleary, Michael L']","['Ficara F', 'Murphy MJ', 'Lin M', 'Cleary ML']","['Department of Pathology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Cell Stem Cell,Cell stem cell,101311472,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '0 (pbx1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Cycle/*physiology', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cell Proliferation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*physiology', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*physiology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/physiology']",2008/05/09 09:00,2009/01/13 09:00,['2008/05/09 09:00'],"['2007/09/28 00:00 [received]', '2008/02/19 00:00 [revised]', '2008/03/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/05/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/13 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/09 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1934-5909(08)00116-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.stem.2008.03.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Stem Cell. 2008 May 8;2(5):484-96. doi: 10.1016/j.stem.2008.03.004.,5,,,"['R01 CA090735-07/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA042971/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA090735-08/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA90735/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA090735/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA090735-06/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA42971/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC2416441,['NIHMS50594'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to investigate cancer patterns among children of Turkish descent in Germany. METHODS: We identified cases with Turkish names (as a proxy of Turkish descent) among the 37,259 cases of childhood cancer registered in the German Childhood Cancer Registry (GCCR) during 1980-2005. As it is not possible to obtain reference population data for children of Turkish descent, the distribution of cancer diagnoses was compared between cases of Turkish descent and all remaining (mainly German) cases in the registry, using proportional cancer incidence ratios (PCIRs). RESULTS: The overall distribution of cancer diagnoses was similar in the two groups. The PCIRs in three diagnosis groups were increased for cases of Turkish descent: acute non-lymphocytic leukaemia (PCIR 1.23; CI (95%) 1.02-1.47), Hodgkin's disease (1.34; 1.13-1.59) and Non-Hodgkin/Burkitt lymphoma (1.19; 1.02-1.39).

As a sole alteration, it predicts a favorable outcome. Biallelic 13q14.3 (13q14x2) deletion or concomitant 13q14x1/13q14x2 has been scarcely evaluated in the literature. We present the clinical, cytogenetic and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis of six CLL patients with normal karyotypes and 13q14x2 and their comparison to cases with 13q14x1 as a single abnormality. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 103 CLL patients were studied. Cytogenetic and FISH analysis were performed on stimulated peripheral blood lymphocytes. Specific fluorescence DNA probes for CLL were used. RESULTS: Six out of 103 (5.8%) patients showed normal karyotypes and 13q14x2. It was observed as a single alteration in one patient and combined with 13q14x1 in five cases. Biallelic clones were larger than monoallelic ones in 3/5 patients (60%). The comparison of clinical and hematological data between 13q14x1 and 13q14x2 groups showed progression of the disease in all 13q14x2 patients respect to 12/32 (37.5%) cases with 13q14x1 (P = 0.008), significant differences in the distribution by Rai stage (P = 0.042) and a tendency of a higher lactate dehydrogenase level in 13q14x2 patients (P = 0.054). Treatment free survival for 13q14x2 group was 28.5 months, shorter than those observed in patients with 13q14x1 alone (49 months). CONCLUSIONS: Our data would suggest that 13q14x2 could represent a more aggressive FISH anomaly than 13q14x1 alone, probably as a consequence of clonal evolution and/or due to the complete inactivation of this critical region by mean of more complex mechanisms.","['Chena, Christian', 'Avalos, Julio Sanchez', 'Bezares, Raimundo F', 'Arrossagaray, Guillermo', 'Turdo, Karina', 'Bistmans, Alicia', 'Slavutsky, Irma']","['Chena C', 'Avalos JS', 'Bezares RF', 'Arrossagaray G', 'Turdo K', 'Bistmans A', 'Slavutsky I']","[""Departamento de Genetica, Instituto de Investigaciones Hematologicas 'Mariano R.Castex', Academia Nacional de Medicina.""]",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,,IM,"['*Chromosome Deletion', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 13', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Disease Progression', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/mortality/pathology', 'Lymphocytes', 'Survival Rate']",2008/05/09 09:00,2008/10/07 09:00,['2008/05/09 09:00'],"['2008/05/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/07 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/09 09:00 [entrez]']","['EJH1086 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-0609.2008.01086.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2008 Aug;81(2):94-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2008.01086.x.

We investigated the role of allogeneic haematopoietic cell transplantion (allo-HCT) in ANKL. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Three patients with ANKL received allo-HCT and seven did not. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) viral load (VL) of the whole blood was measured with real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: We transplanted three patients using a myeloablative conditioning regimen with human leucocyte antigen (HLA) two-loci mismatched cord blood (n = 2), or HLA-matched sibling bone marrow (n = 1). In one patient, a second transplantation from the haploidentical mother was also performed at relapse. No patients were in complete remission (CR) at the time of conditioning. After allo-HCT, all three achieved and maintained CR. One died from sepsis and the other relapsed, received the second transplantation and achieved a second CR. EBV VL was quite high in all three at presentation and its significant reduction was observed after allo-HCT. Although their backgrounds were not different from those without allo-HCT, patients with allo-HCT had a better outcome. CONCLUSION: Allo-HCT might be a promising therapy for ANKL with curative potential.","['Ito, Toshiro', 'Makishima, Hideki', 'Nakazawa, Hideyuki', 'Kobayashi, Hikaru', 'Shimodaira, Shigetaka', 'Nakazawa, Yozo', 'Kitano, Kiyoshi', 'Matsuda, Kazuyuki', 'Hidaka, Eiko', 'Ishida, Fumihiro']","['Ito T', 'Makishima H', 'Nakazawa H', 'Kobayashi H', 'Shimodaira S', 'Nakazawa Y', 'Kitano K', 'Matsuda K', 'Hidaka E', 'Ishida F']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Shinshu University School of Medicine, Matsumoto, Japan.']",,['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,,IM,"['Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cord Blood Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human', 'Humans', '*Killer Cells, Natural', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*therapy', 'Male', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transplantation Conditioning/methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Viral Load']",2008/05/09 09:00,2008/10/07 09:00,['2008/05/09 09:00'],"['2008/05/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/07 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/09 09:00 [entrez]']","['EJH1090 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-0609.2008.01090.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2008 Aug;81(2):107-11. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2008.01090.x.

We performed a retrospective clinicopathologic analysis of the placenta following chemotherapy. Charts were reviewed for type of malignancy, type and timing of chemotherapy, and fetal and pregnancy outcome. Placentas were studied by standard pathologic analysis as well as computer-assisted morphometry and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis. Patients (n = 13) underwent chemotherapy during pregnancy for carcinoma of breast (3), ovary (2), cervix (2), salivary gland (1), lymphoma/leukemia (4), or rhabdomyosarcoma (1). Eleven patients were treated with DNA-active cytotoxic agents during the 2nd and/or 3rd trimesters; their placentas showed nonspecific findings, including villous hypermaturity, distal villous hypoplasia, villous edema, and excessive extravillous trophoblast, and 4/11 (36%) were small-for-age. In one case (rhabdomyosarcoma), the mother was exposed to cytotoxic agents throughout the entire pregnancy. In this case, associated with severe congenital anomalies, the placenta showed striking nuclear pleomorphism of the extravillous trophoblast of the chorion laeve, associated with FISH-demonstrated hyperpolyploidy. One patient was treated with the targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor, imatinib, in 2 consecutive pregnancies; these placentas showed no specific anomalies. Our findings suggest that chemotherapy during the 1st trimester induces excessive polyploidization of the chorion laeve trophoblast, likely representing an adaptive response to intraamniotic toxins. Second and 3rd trimester exposure to cytotoxic agents may predispose to placental underdevelopment. However, without appropriate controls (untreated patients with equivalent malignancies), the specific effects of chemotherapy in this group are difficult to assess.","['Abellar, Rosanna G', 'Pepperell, John R', 'Greco, David', 'Gundogan, Fusun', 'Kostadinov, Stefan', 'Schwartz, Joanna', 'Tantravahi, Umadevi', 'De Paepe, Monique E']","['Abellar RG', 'Pepperell JR', 'Greco D', 'Gundogan F', 'Kostadinov S', 'Schwartz J', 'Tantravahi U', 'De Paepe ME']","['Department of Pathology, Women and Infants Hospital, Providence, RI, USA.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Pediatr Dev Pathol,Pediatric and developmental pathology : the official journal of the Society for Pediatric Pathology and the Paediatric Pathology Society,9809673,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Abnormalities, Multiple/chemically induced', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Placenta/*drug effects/*pathology', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications, Neoplastic/*drug therapy', 'Pregnancy Trimester, First', 'Pregnancy Trimester, Second', 'Pregnancy Trimester, Third', 'Retrospective Studies']",2008/05/09 09:00,2009/05/09 09:00,['2008/05/09 09:00'],"['2008/03/14 00:00 [received]', '2008/05/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/05/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/09 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/09 09:00 [entrez]']","['08-03-0435 [pii]', '10.2350/08-03-0435.1 [doi]']",ppublish,Pediatr Dev Pathol. 2009 Jan-Feb;12(1):35-41. doi: 10.2350/08-03-0435.1.,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Expression of CD137 and CD137L was assessed by immunohistochemistry in frozen sections of 12 human normal tissues, 15 benign tumors of epithelial or mesenchymal origin (adenoma and leiomyoma), and 36 malignant tumors of epithelial origin (squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma). The expression of CD137L on 9 human tumor cell lines (3 hepatocarcinoma, 2 lung carcinoma, 2 colon carcinoma, 1 lymphoma, and 1 leukemia) was detected by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. To analyze the role of CD137L expressed on tumor cells, we co-cultured tumor cells expressing CD137L with activated T lymphocytes expressing CD137 or with Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing CD137 and then detected by ELISA the levels of cytokines (IL-8, IFN-gamma) secreted by tumor cells or activated T cells. RESULTS: The expression of CD137 and CD137L was observed only in human benign (2/15, 3/15) or malignant tumors (15/36, 21/36), but not in normal tissues (0/12, 0/12). CD137 was expressed on the vessel walls within tumor tissues, whereas CD137L was expressed on tumor cells. The expression of CD137 and CD137L was more common in malignant tumors, especially in moderate or low-differentiated tumors. Furthermore, CD137L expression found on tumor cell lines was functional because the ligation of CD137L on lung squamous carcinoma cells L78 with CD137 on T cells induced IFN-gamma production by T cells, and ligation of CD137L on hepatocarcinoma cells HepG2.2.15 with CD137 triggered tumor cells to produce IL-8.

The coculture of an HTLV-1-infected T-cell line MT-2 with an uninfected MOLT-4 induced syncytium, a marker of cell-cell HTLV-1 infection, but an RNA interference-mediated knockdown of Dlg1 in both cells cooperatively reduced the syncytium formation. In HTLV-1-uninfected 293T cells, Dlg1 induced the clustering of GLUT1, a cellular receptor for HTLV-1, but such clustering was abrogated by a deletion of the PDZ domain binding motif of GLUT1 (GLUT1DeltaC). GLUT1 expression in MDBK cells induced HTLV-1-mediated syncytium formation, and the activity was much greater than that of GLUT1DeltaC. These results suggest that Dlg1, through the interaction with GLUT1 as well as Env, plays a positive role in the syncytium formation induced by HTLV-1.","['Yoshida, Sakiko', 'Higuchi, Masaya', 'Shoji, Toshiyuki', 'Yoshita, Manami', 'Ishioka, Kojiro', 'Takahashi, Masahiko', 'Oie, Masayasu', 'Tanaka, Yuetsu', 'Uchiyama, Makoto', 'Fujii, Masahiro']","['Yoshida S', 'Higuchi M', 'Shoji T', 'Yoshita M', 'Ishioka K', 'Takahashi M', 'Oie M', 'Tanaka Y', 'Uchiyama M', 'Fujii M']","['Division of Virology, Niigata University Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, 1-757 Asahimachi-Dori, Niigata 951-8510, Japan.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Virus Genes,Virus genes,8803967,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (DLG1 protein, human)', '0 (Discs Large Homolog 1 Protein)', '0 (Glucose Transporter Type 1)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (SLC2A1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/genetics/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Cattle', '*Cell Communication', 'Cell Fusion', 'Cell Line', 'Discs Large Homolog 1 Protein', 'Gene Expression', 'Giant Cells/metabolism/*virology', 'Glucose Transporter Type 1/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'HTLV-I Infections/metabolism/*physiopathology/virology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'PDZ Domains', '*RNA Interference', 'Receptors, Virus/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Sequence Deletion', 'T-Lymphocytes/*physiology/virology']",2008/05/08 09:00,2008/09/05 09:00,['2008/05/08 09:00'],"['2008/02/04 00:00 [received]', '2008/04/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/05/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/05 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/08 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s11262-008-0234-0 [doi]'],ppublish,Virus Genes. 2008 Aug;37(1):9-15. doi: 10.1007/s11262-008-0234-0.

In 117 serum samples analyzed by vector rescue assay there was no detectable RCR. An additional 149 mice received HSCs transduced with lentiviral vectors, and were followed for 2-6 months. No vector-associated adverse events were observed, and none of the mice had detectable human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) p24 antigen in their sera. Our in vivo system, therefore, helps to provide an assessment of the risks involved when retroviral or lentiviral vectors are considered for use in clinical gene therapy applications.","['Bauer, Gerhard', 'Dao, Mo A', 'Case, Scott S', 'Meyerrose, Todd', 'Wirthlin, Louisa', 'Zhou, Ping', 'Wang, Xiuli', 'Herrbrich, Phillip', 'Arevalo, Jesusa', 'Csik, Susie', 'Skelton, Dianne C', 'Walker, Jon', 'Pepper, Karen', 'Kohn, Donald B', 'Nolta, Jan A']","['Bauer G', 'Dao MA', 'Case SS', 'Meyerrose T', 'Wirthlin L', 'Zhou P', 'Wang X', 'Herrbrich P', 'Arevalo J', 'Csik S', 'Skelton DC', 'Walker J', 'Pepper K', 'Kohn DB', 'Nolta JA']","['Stem Cell Program, Department of Internal Medicine, University of California, Davis, Sacramento, California 95817, USA.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Ther,Molecular therapy : the journal of the American Society of Gene Therapy,100890581,,IM,"['Animals', 'Biological Assay', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Genetic Therapy/*adverse effects', 'Genetic Vectors/*adverse effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/virology', '*Lentivirus', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/virology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Models, Animal', '*Moloney murine leukemia virus', '*Retroviridae', 'Risk', '*Transduction, Genetic']",2008/05/08 09:00,2008/08/05 09:00,['2008/05/08 09:00'],"['2008/05/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/05 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1525-0016(16)32472-8 [pii]', '10.1038/mt.2008.93 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Ther. 2008 Jul;16(7):1308-15. doi: 10.1038/mt.2008.93.

ESCs are generally cultured on mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) or MEF conditioned medium (MEF-CM). However, for therapeutic applications, it is preferable for ESCs to be cultured under chemically defined conditions. Here, we report synthetic compounds that allow expansion of undifferentiated mouse ESCs in the absence of MEF, Leukemia Inhibitory Factor (LIF), and Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS). ESCs cultured for more than 30 d in a serum-free medium supplemented with indole derivertives retained their characteristic morphology and expressed markers such as SSEA-1, OCT3/4, Rex-1, Sox2, and Nanog. They consistently differentiated into many types of cells, including neurons, muscle cells, and hepatocytes. These results indicate that our compounds provide a more efficient and safer large-scale culture system for pluripotent ESCs, and hence might contribute to the use of ESCs in therapeutic applications.","['Miyabayashi, Tomoyuki', 'Yamamoto, Masashi', 'Sato, Akiko', 'Sakano, Seiji', 'Takahashi, Yasuyuki']","['Miyabayashi T', 'Yamamoto M', 'Sato A', 'Sakano S', 'Takahashi Y']","['Central R&D Laboratories, Asahi Kasei Corporation, Fuji, Shizuoka 416-8501, Japan. miyabayashi.tb@om.asahi-kasei.co.jp']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Biosci Biotechnol Biochem,"Bioscience, biotechnology, and biochemistry",9205717,"['0 (Culture Media, Serum-Free)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Organic Cation Transport Proteins)', '0 (Small Molecule Libraries)', '0 (solute carrier family 22 (organic cation transporter), member 3)', '8724FJW4M5 (indole)', 'EC 3.1.3.1 (Alkaline Phosphatase)']",IM,"['Alkaline Phosphatase/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Culture Media, Serum-Free', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/*cytology/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Indoles/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Organic Cation Transport Proteins/genetics', 'Regeneration', 'Small Molecule Libraries/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Time Factors']",2008/05/08 09:00,2008/07/30 09:00,['2008/05/08 09:00'],"['2008/05/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/30 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['JST.JSTAGE/bbb/70717 [pii]', '10.1271/bbb.70717 [doi]']",ppublish,Biosci Biotechnol Biochem. 2008 May;72(5):1242-8. doi: 10.1271/bbb.70717.

METHODS: HL-60 cells were treated by 5-aza-2 dC at various concentrations for different periods of time. The effect of 5-aza-2 dC on the growth of HL-60 cells were detected by MTT assay. The effect on the cell cycle and differentiation were detected by flow cytometry. The effect on the apoptosis were detected by Hochest33342 staining and flow cytometry. The expression of S100A8 and S100A9 was detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RESULTS: (1) 5-aza-2 dC inhibited the growth of HL-60 cells in a concentration- and time-dependent manner, and HL-60 cells were arrested at G2/M phases; (2) 5-aza-2 dC enhanced the expression of cell differentiation antigen CD11b at HL-60 cells, especially at the low drug concentration; (3) 5-aza-2 dC induced HL-60 cell apoptosis in a concentration- and time-dependent manner, especially at the high drug concentration; (4) 5-aza-2 dC increased the expression levels of S100A8 and S100A9 mRNA in HL-60 cells. CONCLUSION: 5-aza-2 dC can inhibit the growth of HL-60 cells accompanied with G2/M phase arrest, induce the differentiation and apoptosis of the cells, and increase the expression levels of S100A8 and S100A9 mRNA, which may be the anti-AML mechanism of 5-aza-2 dC.","['Xiao, Yan-hua', 'Yi, Hong', 'Tan, Tan', 'Liang, Ting', 'Chen, Zhu-chu', 'Xiao, Zhi-qiang']","['Xiao YH', 'Yi H', 'Tan T', 'Liang T', 'Chen ZC', 'Xiao ZQ']","['Key Laboratory of Cancer Proteomics of Chinese Ministry of Health, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, China.']",,['chi'],['Journal Article'],China,Zhong Nan Da Xue Xue Bao Yi Xue Ban,Zhong nan da xue xue bao.

DESIGN: Observational study. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: Department of Paediatrics, Liaquat University of Medical and Health Sciences (LUMHS), Jamshoro, from October 2005 to March 2007. PATIENTS AND METHODS: All patients aged 2 months to 15 years having pancytopenia were included. Patients beyond this age limits, already diagnosed cases of aplastic anemia and leukemia, clinical suspicion of genetic or constitutional pancytopenia, history of blood transfusion in recent past, and those not willing for either admission or bone marrow examination were excluded. History, physical and systemic examination and hematological parameters at presentation were recorded. Hematological profile included hemoglobin, total and differential leucocyte count, platelet count, reticulocyte count, peripheral smear and bone marrow aspiration/biopsy. RESULTS: During the study period, out of the 7000 admissions in paediatric ward, 250 patients had pancytopenia on their peripheral blood smear (3.57%). Out of those, 230 patients were finally studied. Cause of pancytopenia was identified in 220 cases on the basis of bone marrow and other supportive investigations, while 10 cases remained undiagnosed. Most common was aplastic anemia (23.9%), megaloblastic anemia (13.04%), leukemia (13.05%), enteric fever (10.8%), malaria (8.69%) and sepsis (8.69%). Common clinical presentations were pallor, fever, petechial hemorrhages, visceromegaly and bleeding from nose and gastrointestinal tract. CONCLUSION: Pancytopenia is a common occurrence in paediatric patients. Though acute leukemia and bone marrow failure were the usual causes of pancytopenia, infections and megaloblastic anemia are easily treatable and reversible.","['Memon, Shazia', 'Shaikh, Salma', 'Nizamani, M Akbar A']","['Memon S', 'Shaikh S', 'Nizamani MA']","['Department of Paediatrics, Liaquat University of Medical and Health Sciences, Hyderabad. shaziamemon-ap@hotmail.com']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],Pakistan,J Coll Physicians Surg Pak,Journal of the College of Physicians and Surgeons--Pakistan : JCPSP,9606447,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Anemia, Aplastic/*complications', 'Anemia, Megaloblastic/complications', '*Bone Marrow Examination', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Hematologic Tests', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/*complications', 'Malaria/complications', 'Pancytopenia/blood/*etiology', 'Sepsis/complications', 'Typhoid Fever/complications']",2008/05/08 09:00,2008/07/25 09:00,['2008/05/08 09:00'],"['2007/06/26 00:00 [received]', '2008/02/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/05/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/25 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['040579197 [pii]', '03.2008/JCPSP.163167 [doi]']",ppublish,J Coll Physicians Surg Pak. 2008 Mar;18(3):163-7. doi: 03.2008/JCPSP.163167.,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This problem is typically approached by applying post hoc corrections to control the false discovery rate, without taking into account prior biological knowledge. Pathway or gene ontology analysis can provide an alternative way to relax the significance threshold applied to single genes and may lead to a better biological interpretation. RESULTS: Here we propose a new analysis method based on the study of networks of pathways. These networks are reconstructed considering both the significance of single pathways (network nodes) and the intersection between them (links). We apply this method for the reconstruction of networks of pathways to two gene expression datasets: the first one obtained from a c-Myc rat fibroblast cell line expressing a conditional Myc-estrogen receptor oncoprotein; the second one obtained from the comparison of Acute Myeloid Leukemia and Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia derived from bone marrow samples. CONCLUSION: Our method extends statistical models that have been recently adopted for the significance analysis of functional groups of genes to infer links between these groups. We show that groups of genes at the interface between different pathways can be considered as relevant even if the pathways they belong to are not significant by themselves.","['Francesconi, Mirko', 'Remondini, Daniel', 'Neretti, Nicola', 'Sedivy, John M', 'Cooper, Leon N', 'Verondini, Ettore', 'Milanesi, Luciano', 'Castellani, Gastone']","['Francesconi M', 'Remondini D', 'Neretti N', 'Sedivy JM', 'Cooper LN', 'Verondini E', 'Milanesi L', 'Castellani G']","['Centro Interdipartimentale ""L, Galvani"", Universita di Bologna, Bologna 40127, Italy. mirko.francesconi@studio.unibo.it']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,BMC Bioinformatics,BMC bioinformatics,100965194,['0 (Proteome)'],IM,"['*Algorithms', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data Interpretation, Statistical', 'Gene Expression Profiling/*methods', '*Models, Biological', 'Models, Statistical', 'Protein Interaction Mapping/*methods', 'Proteome/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', '*Software']",2008/05/09 09:00,2008/06/07 09:00,['2008/05/09 09:00'],"['2008/05/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/07 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/09 09:00 [entrez]']","['1471-2105-9-S4-S9 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2105-9-S4-S9 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Bioinformatics. 2008 Apr 25;9 Suppl 4:S9. doi: 10.1186/1471-2105-9-S4-S9.,,,,"['R01 GM041690/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM41690-17/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",20080425,PMC2367636,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The authors reviewed outcomes of 78 evaluable patients who were consecutively treated for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) from October 2002 through January 2007. Several successive prophylactic antibiotic regimens were used. All patients received antifungal prophylaxis with oral voriconazole. RESULTS: Oral cephalosporins did not significantly reduce the odds of bacterial sepsis (P = .81) or streptococcal (S. viridans) sepsis (P = .90) relative to no prophylaxis. Intravenous (iv) cefepime completely prevented streptococcal (S. viridans) sepsis and reduced the odds of bacterial sepsis 91% (P < .0001) relative to no prophylaxis, but resistant gram-negative bacteria emerged in 2 patients. Vancomycin with oral ciprofloxacin or a cephalosporin reduced the odds of bacterial sepsis by 93% (P < .0001) and streptococcal (S. viridans) sepsis by 99% (P < .0001). The fungal infection rate did not differ significantly between patients who did and did not receive antibiotic prophylaxis (1.0 per 1000 patient-days for both groups). The observed reduction in average hospital days per chemotherapy course for patients given vancomycin regimens or cefepime was 5.7 (P < .0001) and 4.1 (P = .0039) days, respectively. No reduction was observed with oral cephalosporins (P = .10). Furthermore, vancomycin regimens or cefepime were associated with a 20% reduction in healthcare charges (P = .0015) relative to using no antibiotics.

The aim of this survey was to study systematically the use of CAM in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). PATIENTS AND METHODS: A structured questionnaire was sent to 247 CLL patients of all clinical stages and disease durations, treated and untreated. The questionnaire was returned anonymously by 87 patients (35%). RESULTS: Thirty-nine patients (44%) had used alternative treatments. No correlation was seen with educational level, gender, or previous or current chemotherapy. The most common alternative or complementary treatment modality was vitamin supplementation (26%), followed by mineral (18%), homeopathic (14%), and mistletoe therapy (9.2%). Some 21% of patients considered their alternative treatment as being successful. Most patients reported that they decided to use CAM after conducting a personal investigation and based on the information they found, without outside recommendations (59%). The majority of the patients used patient brochures about CLL as an important source of information (54%), followed by specific lectures (34%) or the internet (32%). CONCLUSION: Our data show that patients with CLL use a wide range of CAM, among them potentially harmful methods. Rational, evidence-based medical information about the effects and risks of CAM use should be made available through patient brochures distributed by patient organizations, through information events with lectures, or via the internet.","['Hensel, Manfred', 'Zoz, Martin', 'Ho, Anthony D']","['Hensel M', 'Zoz M', 'Ho AD']","['Department of Medicine V, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.

The relaxation effect was pronouncedly enhanced by H(2)S- and HS(-)-donor NaHS (30 micromol/l) at 7.5 pH but not at 6.3 pH. To study molecular mechanism of this effect, we investigated whether NaHS can release NO from NO donors. Using an electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy method of spin trap and by measuring the NO oxidation product, which is nitrite, by the Griess reaction, we report that NaHS released NO from nitrosothiols, namely from GSNO, S-nitroso-N-acetyl-DL: -penicillamine (SNAP), from metal nitrosyl complex nitroprusside (SNP) and from rat brain homogenate and murine L1210 leukaemia cells. From the observation that the releasing effect was more pronounced at 8.0 pH than 6.0 pH, we suppose that HS(-), rather than H(2)S, is responsible for the NO-releasing effect. Since in mammals, H(2)S and HS(-) are produced endogenously, we assume that their effect to release NO from nitrosothiols and from metal nitrosyl complexes are responsible for some of their biological activities and that this mechanism may be involved in S-nitrosothiol-signalling reactions.","['Ondrias, Karol', 'Stasko, Andrej', 'Cacanyiova, Sona', 'Sulova, Zdena', 'Krizanova, Olga', 'Kristek, Frantisek', 'Malekova, Lubica', 'Knezl, Vladimir', 'Breier, Albert']","['Ondrias K', 'Stasko A', 'Cacanyiova S', 'Sulova Z', 'Krizanova O', 'Kristek F', 'Malekova L', 'Knezl V', 'Breier A']","['Institute of Molecular Physiology and Genetics, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Vlarska 5, 833 34, Bratislava, Slovak Republic. karol.ondrias@savba.sk']",,['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Pflugers Arch,Pflugers Archiv : European journal of physiology,0154720,"['0 (Nitric Oxide Donors)', '0 (Nitrites)', '0 (Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear)', '0 (S-Nitrosothiols)', '0 (Sulfides)', '0 (Vasodilator Agents)', '169D1260KM (Nitroprusside)', '31C4KY9ESH (Nitric Oxide)', '57564-91-7 (S-Nitrosoglutathione)', '79032-48-7 (S-Nitroso-N-Acetylpenicillamine)', 'EC 4.6.1.2 (Guanylate Cyclase)', 'EC 4.6.1.2 (Soluble Guanylyl Cyclase)', 'FWU2KQ177W (sodium bisulfide)', 'YY9FVM7NSN (Hydrogen Sulfide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Aorta, Thoracic/drug effects/metabolism', 'Brain/*drug effects/enzymology/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Electron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Guanylate Cyclase/metabolism', 'Hydrogen Sulfide/*metabolism', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Leukemia L1210/enzymology/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Nitric Oxide/*metabolism', '*Nitric Oxide Donors/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Nitrites/metabolism', 'Nitroprusside/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear/metabolism', 'S-Nitroso-N-Acetylpenicillamine/metabolism', 'S-Nitrosoglutathione/metabolism', 'S-Nitrosothiols/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Soluble Guanylyl Cyclase', 'Sulfides/*pharmacology', 'Time Factors', 'Vasodilation/drug effects', '*Vasodilator Agents/metabolism/pharmacology']",2008/05/07 09:00,2009/03/13 09:00,['2008/05/07 09:00'],"['2008/02/22 00:00 [received]', '2008/04/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/03/31 00:00 [revised]', '2008/05/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/03/13 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/07 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00424-008-0519-0 [doi]'],ppublish,Pflugers Arch. 2008 Nov;457(2):271-9. doi: 10.1007/s00424-008-0519-0.

While TRAIL is relatively non-toxic to normal cells, it selectively induces apoptosis in many transformed cells. Nevertheless, breast tumor cells are particularly resistant to the effects of TRAIL. Here we report that, in combination with the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor roscovitine, exposure to TRAIL induced marked apoptosis in the majority of TRAIL-resistant breast cancer cell lines examined. Roscovitine facilitated TRAIL death-inducing signaling complex formation and the activation of caspase-8. The cFLIP(L) and cFLIP(S) FLICE-inhibitory proteins were significantly down-regulated following exposure to roscovitine and, indeed, the knockdown of cFLIP isoforms by siRNA sensitized breast tumor cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. In addition, we demonstrate that roscovitine strongly suppressed Mcl-1 expression and up-regulated E2F1 protein levels in breast tumor cells. Significantly, the silencing of Mcl-1 by siRNA sensitized breast tumor cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, the knockdown of E2F1 protein by siRNA reduced the sensitizing effect of roscovitine in TRAIL-induced apoptosis. In summary, our results reveal a pleitropic mechanism for the pro-apoptotic influence of roscovitine, highlighting its potential as an antitumor agent in breast cancer in combination with TRAIL.","['Ortiz-Ferron, Gustavo', 'Yerbes, Rosario', 'Eramo, Adriana', 'Lopez-Perez, Ana I', 'De Maria, Ruggero', 'Lopez-Rivas, Abelardo']","['Ortiz-Ferron G', 'Yerbes R', 'Eramo A', 'Lopez-Perez AI', 'De Maria R', 'Lopez-Rivas A']","['Centro Andaluz de Biologia Molecular y Medicina Regenerativa, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC), Avda Americo Vespucio s/n, 41092 Sevilla, Spain.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Cell Res,Cell research,9425763,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CASP8 and FADD-Like Apoptosis Regulating Protein)', '0 (Death Domain Receptor Signaling Adaptor Proteins)', '0 (E2F1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (E2F1 protein, human)', '0 (Fas-Associated Death Domain Protein)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Purines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0ES1C2KQ94 (Roscovitine)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Breast Neoplasms/drug therapy/enzymology/metabolism/*pathology', 'CASP8 and FADD-Like Apoptosis Regulating Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Membrane/drug effects/metabolism', 'Death Domain Receptor Signaling Adaptor Proteins/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'E2F1 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Fas-Associated Death Domain Protein/metabolism', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Membrane Microdomains/drug effects/metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Protein Isoforms/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics', 'Purines/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/metabolism', 'Roscovitine', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/*pharmacology']",2008/05/07 09:00,2008/08/12 09:00,['2008/05/07 09:00'],"['2008/05/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/12 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['cr200854 [pii]', '10.1038/cr.2008.54 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Res. 2008 Jun;18(6):664-76. doi: 10.1038/cr.2008.54.,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Whole-body bone marrow scintigraphy was performed in 420 adult and 48 childhood leukaemia patients using Tc-sulfur colloid (370 MBq). Central bone marrow (CBM) from the iliac crest and e-PBM from the proximal epiphyseal line of the tibia were aspirated at the time of routine examination and compared. RESULTS: The expansion rate of the PBM in the non-remission stage of acute leukaemia was 73.1%, and it decreased to 38.4% in the complete remission stage. The most common site of PBM expansion was the epiphysis of the knee joint (74.5%). Cytological examination of the e-PBM at the complete remission stage revealed 30.9% localized residual leukaemia. The complete remission period (69+/-23 days) of PBM expansion was significantly greater than that of CBM depletion (43+/-31 days) (P<0.01). Localized residual leukaemia of the e-PBM could not be detected in the childhood acute leukaemia patients and in the patients without e-PBM. The difference in the relapse rate and time was statistically significant between patients with e-PBM (29.1%) and without e-PBM (3.5%) (P<0.01). CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that induction chemotherapy does not always have a synchronous and parallel effect on CBM and PBM. The e-PBM is less sensitive to chemotherapy and can easily exist in localized residual leukaemia. The detection of residual leukaemia in the e-PBM by bone marrow scintigraphy is very important in the treatment of leukaemia.","['Liu, Yong', 'Zhang, Yifan', 'Hao, Weidong', 'Liu, Dai', 'Li, Ai', 'Chen, Chunyan']","['Liu Y', 'Zhang Y', 'Hao W', 'Liu D', 'Li A', 'Chen C']","['Department of Nuclear Medicine, The Second Hospital of Shandong University, Shandong, China. yongliu1958@hotmail.com']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Nucl Med Commun,Nuclear medicine communications,8201017,"['0 (Radiopharmaceuticals)', '556Q0P6PB1 (Technetium Tc 99m Sulfur Colloid)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow Neoplasms/*diagnostic imaging/therapy', 'Extremities/*diagnostic imaging', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*diagnostic imaging', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*diagnostic imaging/prevention & control', 'Radionuclide Imaging', 'Radiopharmaceuticals', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', '*Technetium Tc 99m Sulfur Colloid']",2008/05/07 09:00,2008/07/23 09:00,['2008/05/07 09:00'],"['2008/05/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/23 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/MNM.0b013e3282f5d2ee [doi]', '00006231-200806000-00006 [pii]']",ppublish,Nucl Med Commun. 2008 Jun;29(6):542-5. doi: 10.1097/MNM.0b013e3282f5d2ee.,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The diagnosis was made upon examination of bone marrow aspirates. The clinical charts were searched for data regarding clinical presentation, diagnosis, initial response with induction therapy, toxicity of ATRA, and antracyclic drug (daunorubicin). The median age was 10 years; the male-to-female ratio was 2:1. Fourteen patients received induction chemotherapy. Thirteen achieved complete remission. Six patients showed signs of coagulopathy. Only 1 patient was diagnosed with ATRA syndrome. There was a death owing to sepsis before the beginning of the therapy and 2 relapses with death associated with the therapy discontinuation.

The veins, which are commonly used in pediatric patients are internal and external jugular veins. Comparison of different venous approaches has been discussed in a few reports only. The present study reviews the complication rate, operation time of implanting the port via different veins in children. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From January 2003 to December 2005, 94 venous access ports were implanted in 88 consecutive patients in the Pediatric Surgical section of the Taipei Veterans General Hospital. The patients were classified according to the vein used. Group A (n=45), the external jugular vein access group; and group B (n=43), the internal jugular vein access group. RESULTS: The operation time in group A and B were 38.4+/-11.1 and 57.6+/-20.3 min, respectively. The mean operation time of group A was significantly shorter than that of group B (P<0.001). The overall complication rates in group A and B were 8.5%, and 19.1%, respectively. These differences, however, were not significant (P>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The external jugular vein approach has a shorter operation time and a lower complication rate than the internal jugular vein approach. This approach may be a method of choice in selected pediatric patients.","['Tsai, Hsin-Lin', 'Liu, Chin-Su', 'Chang, Jei-Wen', 'Wei, Chou-Fu', 'Chin, Tai-Wai']","['Tsai HL', 'Liu CS', 'Chang JW', 'Wei CF', 'Chin TW']","['Division of Pediatric Surgery, Department of Surgery, Veterans General Hospital-Taipei and Institute of Clinical Medicine, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,,IM,"['Bone Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Brain Neoplasms/drug therapy', '*Catheters, Indwelling', 'Child', 'Eye Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Jugular Veins', 'Leukemia/drug therapy', 'Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Neuroblastoma/drug therapy', 'Osteosarcoma/drug therapy', 'Retinoblastoma/drug therapy', 'Safety']",2008/05/07 09:00,2008/08/08 09:00,['2008/05/07 09:00'],"['2008/05/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/08 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/07 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/MPH.0b013e31816916bf [doi]'],ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2008 May;30(5):366-8. doi: 10.1097/MPH.0b013e31816916bf.,5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study of children with refractory acute leukemia was designed to take advantage of this biochemical modulation. A fixed dose of HU and an escalating dose of ara-C were used. Oral HU (1200 mg/m2) was followed 2 hours later by ara-C (250-3100 mg/m2) intravenously in 15 minutes. The combination was given on days 1, 2, 3 and 8, 9, 10. Thirty-three children [26 acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), 7 acute nonlymphocytic leukemia] were treated; 29 received at least 1 full course. All patients developed grade 4 cytopenias. Other grade 3 to 4 toxicities included hyperbilirubinemia (2), elevated transaminases (3), transient gait disturbance (1), stomatitis (3), typhlitis (1), nausea/vomiting (9), and marrow aplasia >4 weeks (1). Three patients had intracranial bleeds while thrombocytopenic. Only liver toxicities and nausea/vomiting exhibited any dosage effect. The maximum tolerated dose of ara-C was 2400 mg/m2. There were 6 complete responses (5 ALL), 5 partial responses (3 ALL), and 19 patients with no response or progressive disease. There was no dosage effect for response with 2 complete responses occurring at the lowest ara-C level. Responses were transient (1 to 3 mo). Twenty of twenty-six patients achieved a peak serum HU level >0.5 mM by 2 hours after the HU dose. The mean level at 2 hours was 0.57 mM (range: 0.21 to 0.99 mM). This combination of HU and ara-C is tolerable and has efficacy in refractory leukemias. Responses at the lowest ara-C dose level suggests synergism.","['Dubowy, Ronald', 'Graham, Michael', 'Hakami, Nasrollah', 'Kletzel, Morris', 'Mahoney, Donald', 'Newman, Edward', 'Ravindranath, Yaddanapudi', 'Camitta, Bruce']","['Dubowy R', 'Graham M', 'Hakami N', 'Kletzel M', 'Mahoney D', 'Newman E', 'Ravindranath Y', 'Camitta B']","['Department of Pediatrics of the State University of New York, Health Science Center, Syracuse, NY, USA.']",,['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/*toxicity', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/administration & dosage/*toxicity', 'Infections/epidemiology', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/mortality', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/drug therapy/mortality', 'Liver/drug effects/pathology', 'Skin/drug effects/pathology', 'Survival Analysis']",2008/05/07 09:00,2008/08/08 09:00,['2008/05/07 09:00'],"['2008/05/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/08 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/07 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/MPH.0b013e318166247e [doi]'],ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2008 May;30(5):353-7. doi: 10.1097/MPH.0b013e318166247e.,5,,,"['U10 CA098413/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA098543/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC4601800,['NIHMS721202'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

The clinical records of 20 children (2 to 15-y old) who had received maintenance chemotherapy were reviewed retrospectively and their genomic DNA was genotyped to identify polymorphisms at MTHFR 677C/T, RFC1 80G/A, and thiopurine methyltransferase 719A/G. Maintenance chemotherapy with 6MP and MTX was repeated on a weekly basis, and any week during which 6MP and/or MTX dosing was withheld was counted as an interrupted episode. Associations between the risk of interruptions and polymorphisms were studied using a generalized estimating equation analysis. Patients with an increasing number of T alleles at MTHFR 677C/T experienced interruptions in both 6MP (P<0.01) and MTX (P=0.03) more frequently. Patients with an increasing number of A alleles at RFC1 80G/A experienced interruptions in 6MP (P=0.04) more frequently.

A 500K SNP array analysis uncovered frequent genetic abnormalities, with cryptic deletions constituting half of the detected changes, implying that microdeletions are a characteristic feature of this malignancy. Importantly, the pattern of deletions resembled that recently reported in pediatric ALL, suggesting that adult, adolescent, and childhood cases may be more similar on the genetic level than previously thought. Thus, 70% of the cases displayed deletion of one or more of the CDKN2A, PAX5, IKZF1, ETV6, RB1, and EBF1 genes. Furthermore, several genes not previously implicated in the pathogenesis of ALL were identified as possible recurrent targets of deletion. In total, the SNP array analysis identified 367 genetic abnormalities not corresponding to known copy number polymorphisms, with all but two cases (96%) displaying at least one cryptic change. The resolution level of this SNP array study is the highest used to date to investigate a malignant hematologic disorder. Our findings provide insights into the leukemogenic process and may be clinically important in adult and adolescent ALL.

OBJECTIVE: To synthesize the published literature on the efficacy, effectiveness, and toxicity of hydroxyurea when used in adults with sickle cell disease. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, EMBASE, TOXLine, and CINAHL were searched through 30 June 2007. STUDY SELECTION: Randomized trials, observational studies, and case reports evaluating efficacy and toxicity of hydroxyurea in adults with sickle cell disease, and toxicity studies of hydroxyurea in other conditions that were published in English. DATA EXTRACTION: Paired reviewers abstracted data on study design, patient characteristics, and outcomes sequentially and did quality assessments independently. DATA SYNTHESIS: In the single randomized trial, the hemoglobin level was higher in hydroxyurea recipients than placebo recipients after 2 years (difference, 6 g/L), as was fetal hemoglobin (absolute difference, 3.2%). The median number of painful crises was 44% lower than in the placebo group. The 12 observational studies that enrolled adults reported a relative increase in fetal hemoglobin of 4% to 20% and a relative reduction in crisis rates by 68% to 84%. Hospital admissions declined by 18% to 32%. The evidence suggests that hydroxyurea may impair spermatogenesis. Limited evidence indicates that hydroxyurea treatment in adults with sickle cell disease is not associated with leukemia. Likewise, limited evidence suggests that hydroxyurea and leg ulcers are not associated in patients with sickle cell disease, and evidence is insufficient to estimate the risk for skin neoplasms, although these outcomes can be attributed to hydroxyurea in other conditions. LIMITATION: Only English-language articles were included, and some studies were of lower quality. CONCLUSION: Hydroxyurea has demonstrated efficacy in adults with sickle cell disease. The paucity of long-term studies limits conclusions about toxicity.","['Lanzkron, Sophie', 'Strouse, John J', 'Wilson, Renee', 'Beach, Mary Catherine', 'Haywood, Carlton', 'Park, HaeSong', 'Witkop, Catherine', 'Bass, Eric B', 'Segal, Jodi B']","['Lanzkron S', 'Strouse JJ', 'Wilson R', 'Beach MC', 'Haywood C', 'Park H', 'Witkop C', 'Bass EB', 'Segal JB']","['School of Medicine ,Johns Hopkins University, 1830 East Monument Street, Suite 7300, Baltimore, MD 21205, USA.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",United States,Ann Intern Med,Annals of internal medicine,0372351,"['0 (Antisickling Agents)', '0 (Hemoglobins)', '9034-63-3 (Fetal Hemoglobin)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Anemia, Sickle Cell/blood/*drug therapy', 'Antisickling Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Fetal Hemoglobin/metabolism', 'Hemoglobins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Leg Ulcer/chemically induced', 'Male', 'Pain/prevention & control', 'Spermatogenesis/drug effects']",2008/05/07 09:00,2008/06/24 09:00,['2008/05/07 09:00'],"['2008/05/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/24 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['0000605-200806170-00221 [pii]', '10.7326/0003-4819-148-12-200806170-00221 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Intern Med. 2008 Jun 17;148(12):939-55. doi: 10.7326/0003-4819-148-12-200806170-00221.

Introduction of PTP-PEST into previously activated primary human T cells also reduced subsequent IL-2 production by these cells in response to TCR and CD28 stimulation. The inhibitory effect of PTP-PEST was associated with dephosphorylation the Lck kinase at its activation loop site (Y394), reduced early TCR-induced tyrosine phosphorylation, reduced ZAP-70 phosphorylation and inhibition of MAP kinase activation. We propose that PTP-PEST tempers T cell activation by dephosphorylating TCR-proximal signaling molecules, such as Lck, and that down-regulation of PTP-PEST may be a reason for the increased response to TCR triggering of previously activated T cells.","['Arimura, Yutaka', 'Vang, Torkel', 'Tautz, Lutz', 'Williams, Scott', 'Mustelin, Tomas']","['Arimura Y', 'Vang T', 'Tautz L', 'Williams S', 'Mustelin T']","['Infectious and Inflammatory Disease Center, Burnham Institute for Medical Research, 10901 North Torrey Pines Road, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA. arimura@research.twmu.ac.jp']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",England,Mol Immunol,Molecular immunology,7905289,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '21820-51-9 (Phosphotyrosine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (CSK Tyrosine-Protein Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Lymphocyte Specific Protein Tyrosine Kinase p56(lck))', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.23 (CSK protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 12)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CSK Tyrosine-Protein Kinase', '*Down-Regulation', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Memory', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia/enzymology/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphocyte Specific Protein Tyrosine Kinase p56(lck)/metabolism', 'Membrane Microdomains/enzymology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Phosphorylation', 'Phosphotyrosine/metabolism', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 12/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*immunology/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'T-Lymphocytes/*enzymology/*immunology', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'src-Family Kinases']",2008/05/07 09:00,2008/07/30 09:00,['2008/05/07 09:00'],"['2007/11/26 00:00 [received]', '2008/03/10 00:00 [revised]', '2008/03/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/05/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/30 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0161-5890(08)00128-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.molimm.2008.03.019 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Immunol. 2008 Jun;45(11):3074-84. doi: 10.1016/j.molimm.2008.03.019.

Although WT1 is known as a key molecule for tumor cell proliferation, the expression pattern of WT1 in leukemic cells in dependency of proliferation has not yet been investigated. Furthermore, WT1 expression was mostly studied by reverse transcriptase PCR and the expression of WT1 protein has not been extensively studied. Here, we analyzed WT1 protein expression in the human myeloid leukemia cell lines K562 and HL-60 by indirect immunofluorescence and flow cytometry. Both cell lines exhibited varying nuclear WT1 immunoreactivity pointing to a cell cycle-dependent and/or proliferation-dependent WT1 expression. In rapidly proliferating cells high levels of WT1 protein were detected by flow cytometry. A reduced proliferation rate was associated with a low WT1 protein expression and an accumulation of cells in G(0)/G(1) phase. During G(0)/G(1) phase cells expressed WT1 at a lower level than in S or G(2)/M phase. Moreover, WT1 expression was diminished in all cell cycle phases in slowly proliferating cells. We conclude that WT1 protein expression is dependent on the cell cycle phase as well as on the proliferation rate. This finding might be relevant for MRD studies and immunotherapeutic strategies targeting WT1.","['Kerst, Gunter', 'Bergold, Nina', 'Viebahn, Susanne', 'Gieseke, Friederike', 'Kalinova, Marketa', 'Trka, Jan', 'Handgretinger, Rupert', 'Muller, Ingo']","['Kerst G', 'Bergold N', 'Viebahn S', 'Gieseke F', 'Kalinova M', 'Trka J', 'Handgretinger R', 'Muller I']","[""Department of Pediatric Cardiology, University Children's Hospital Tuebingen, Hoppe-Seyler-Str. 1, 72076 Tuebingen, Germany. gunter.kerst@med.uni-tuebingen.de""]",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,['0 (WT1 Proteins)'],IM,"['Cell Cycle', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique, Indirect', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism/pathology', 'WT1 Proteins/*metabolism']",2008/05/07 09:00,2008/07/25 09:00,['2008/05/07 09:00'],"['2007/11/19 00:00 [received]', '2008/03/03 00:00 [revised]', '2008/03/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/05/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/25 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0145-2126(08)00144-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2008.03.006 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2008 Sep;32(9):1393-9. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2008.03.006.,9,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report a case of a drug-induced reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) caused by imatinib. CASE-REPORT: A 77-year-old woman with a chronic myeloid leukaemia was treated with imatinib and allopurinol. Nineteen days after the start of treatment, the patient presented fever with a generalized polymorphous rash associated with oral erosions, facial oedema, diffuse lymphadenopathy and blood hypereosinophilia. Histological analysis of skin biopsy specimens suggested a drug-induced reaction. The outcome was favourable two weeks after discontinuation of treatment. Three months later, imatinib was reintroduced because of progression of the patient's chronic myeloid leukaemia, and recurrence of the skin rash and fever was observed within 12 hours. DISCUSSION: Allopurinol was stopped definitively because of its more frequent imputability. Imatinib was reintroduced after considering the benefit-risk ratio and in full knowledge of the existence of cutaneous reactions to imatinib, despite there being only one recent report of DRESS following treatment with imatinib. According to the causality criteria of Begaud et al. regarding imatinib, inherent causality of the drug in our patient was initially possible (I2) and appeared likely (I3) after the rechallenge test. This case clearly illustrates that imatinib is a potential cause of DRESS.","['Goldman, J', 'Duval-Modeste, A-B', 'Lambert, A', 'Contentin, N', 'Courville, P', 'Musette, P', 'Joly, P']","['Goldman J', 'Duval-Modeste AB', 'Lambert A', 'Contentin N', 'Courville P', 'Musette P', 'Joly P']","['Clinique dermatologique, CHU de Rouen, 1 rue de Germont, Rouen, France.']",,['fre'],"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",France,Ann Dermatol Venereol,Annales de dermatologie et de venereologie,7702013,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Benzamides', 'Drug Hypersensitivity/*etiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Piperazines/*adverse effects', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/adverse effects', 'Pyrimidines/*adverse effects', 'Skin/drug effects/*pathology', 'Skin Diseases/chemically induced/immunology']",2008/05/07 09:00,2008/08/12 09:00,['2008/05/07 09:00'],"['2007/07/19 00:00 [received]', '2007/10/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/05/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/12 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0151-9638(08)00235-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.annder.2007.10.007 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Dermatol Venereol. 2008 May;135(5):393-6. doi: 10.1016/j.annder.2007.10.007.

DATA SOURCES: Articles cited in MEDLlNE, EMBASE, TOXLine, and CINAHL through June 30, 2007. REVIEW METHODS: Paired reviewers reviewed each title, abstract, and article to assess eligibility. They abstracted data sequentially and then independently graded the evidence. RESULTS: In one small, randomized trial of HU in children with SCD; the yearly hospitalization rate was lower with HU than placebo (1.1 versus 2.8, p=0.002). The absolute increase in fetal hemoglobin (Hb F%) was 10.7 percent. Twenty observational studies of HU in children reported similar increases in Hb F%, while hemoglobin concentration increased by roughly 1 g/dl. One large randomized trial tested the efficacy of HU in adults with SCD and found that after 2 years of treatment, Hb F% increased by 3.2 percent and hemoglobin increased by 0.6 g/dl, The median number of painful crises was 44 percent (p<0.001) lower among patients treated with HU. The 12 observational studies of HU enrolling adults with SCD supported these findings. Panelists from the Center for the Evaluation of Risks to Human Reproduction reviewed the literature for potential toxicities of HU. They concluded that HU does not cause a growth delay in children 5-15 years old. There were no data on the effects on subsequent generations following exposure of developing germ cells to HU in utero. Some evidence supported impaired spermatogenesis with use of HU. Although we identified six patients taking HU who developed leukemia, the evidence did not support causality. Similarly, the evidence suggested no association between HU and leg ulcers in patients with SCD, although there was in patients with other illnesses. The literature supported neutropenia, skin rashes and nail changes associated with use of HU, but was sparse regarding skin neoplasms or other secondary malignancies in SCD. Only two studies investigated barriers to use of HU. Perceived efficacy and perceived safety of HU had the largest influence on patients' (or parents' ) choice to use HU. Providers reported barriers to be patient concerns about side effects; and their own concerns about HU in older patients, patient compliance, lack of contraception, side effects and carcinogenic potential, doubts about effectiveness, and concern about costs. CONCLUSIONS: HU is efficacious in children and adults with SCD; with an increase in Hb F%, and reduction in hospitalizations and pain crises. However, few studies have measured the effectiveness of HU for SCD in usual practice. The paucity of long-term studies limits conclusions about toxicities and about mortality. Future studies of interventions to overcome the barriers to use of HU in patients with SCD are necessary.","['Segal, Jodi B', 'Strouse, John J', 'Beach, Mary Catherine', 'Haywood, Carlton', 'Witkop, Catherine', 'Park, Haeseong', 'Wilson, Renee F', 'Bass, Eric B', 'Lanzkron, Sophie']","['Segal JB', 'Strouse JJ', 'Beach MC', 'Haywood C', 'Witkop C', 'Park H', 'Wilson RF', 'Bass EB', 'Lanzkron S']",,,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Evid Rep Technol Assess (Full Rep),Evidence report/technology assessment,101082681,"['0 (Antisickling Agents)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Anemia, Sickle Cell/*drug therapy', 'Antisickling Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/adverse effects/*therapeutic use']",2008/05/07 09:00,2008/06/05 09:00,['2008/05/07 09:00'],"['2008/05/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/05 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/07 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Evid Rep Technol Assess (Full Rep). 2008 Mar;(165):1-95.,165,196,,,,PMC4781604,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EU-approved prophylactic indications for posaconazole are similar to those in the US. Posaconazole provided effective prophylaxis against invasive fungal infections and was generally well tolerated in two large, well designed trials in HSCT recipients with GVHD, or patients receiving induction-remission chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) that was expected to result in prolonged neutropenia. It offers coverage of clinically relevant pathogens and is potentially associated with fewer drug-drug interactions than other licensed triazole antifungal agents. Its usefulness in some patients may be limited by the lack of an intravenous formulation, although one is currently being developed. As with other antifungal agents, concerns remain regarding the potential emergence of resistance to broad-spectrum antifungal prophylaxis with posaconazole.

The introduction of rituximab in BL therapeutic schemes has been scarcely explored. The outcome and toxicity of HIV-positive patients with BL treated in a rituximab and intensive chemotherapy-based trial was evaluated. METHODS: Thirty-six consecutive patients, 15 to 55 years of age, diagnosed with advanced stage BL were recruited from July 2003 to August 2006, stratified according to HIV infection status and treated with 6 cycles of intensive chemotherapy including 8 doses of rituximab. RESULTS: Nineteen of the patients (53%) were HIV-infected. Their clinical characteristics were comparable to those of the HIV-negative patients. Complete remission (CR) rates were 88% and 84%, respectively, for HIV-negative and -positive patients. Twenty-seven patients (82% and 68%, respectively, for HIV-negative and -positive patients) completed the 6 protocol scheduled cycles. HIV-infected patients presented higher incidences of grade 3-4 mucositis (27% vs 7% of cycles, P = .0005) and severe infectious episodes (26% vs 8%, P = .0025). However, there were no statistically significant differences in 2-year overall survival (82%, 95% confidence interval [CI], 65%-99% and 73%, 95% CI, 54%-92%, respectively) or 2-year disease-free survival (93%, 95% CI, 82%-99% and 87%, 95% CI 72%-99%, respectively).

METHODS: bcr/abl(+)-CD34+ cells were isolated from bone marrow of chronic myelocytic leukemia (CML) patients and were treated with 0, 10, 100, 1000 ng/ml of G-CSF for 48, 96, 144 hs. CD34 cells from normal bone marrow were used as controls. Cell proliferation was determined by trypan blue dye exclusion, cell-cycle and antigen differentiation were determined by flow cytometry and cell morphology was observed under light microscope. RESULTS: The number of bcr/abl(+)-CD34+ cells was increased obviously in all groups. After cultured for 48 and 96 h, the number of bcr/abl(+)-CD34+ cells at G-CSF 10 ng/ml group was significantly higher than that in G-CSF 0 ng/ml group (P < 0.05) , the number of normal CD34 cells was increased only in the presence of G-CSF. After cultured for 48, 96 and 144 h, the cell number in G-CSF 100 ng/ml group was significantly higher than that in G-CSF 0 ng/ml group (P < 0.05, P < 0.01, P < 0.01, respectively). After cultured for 144 h, the cell percentages in G0/G1 phase for bcr/abl(+)-CD34+ cells in G-CSF 10, 100, 1000 ng/ml groups were significantly less than that in G-CSF 0 ng/ml group (P < 0. 05), and that for normal CD34 cells in G-CSF 10, 100, 1000 ng/ml groups were significantly less than that of G-CSF 0 ng/ml group after cultured for 48 and 96 h. The expressions of CD34 on bcr/abl(+)-CD34+ cells and normal CD34+ cells were decreased along with the culture duration, accompanied by the expression of CD33 and CD13 increased first and decreased later, which was not correlated with the concentration of G-CSF. Both bcr/abl(+)-CD34+ cells and normal CD34+ cells showed mature morphology along with proliferation and differentiation. CONCLUSIONS: G-CSF promotes proliferation of both bcr/abl(+)-CD34+ cells and normal CD34+ cells, but not necessary for the former, and the former differentiates more rapidly than the latter does, but both was independent of G-CSF.","['Li, Cheng-Yu', 'Meng, Fan-Yi', 'Sun, Qi-Xin', 'Fu, Yun-Bi', 'Jiang, Qian-Li', 'Yi, Zheng-Shan', 'Song, Lan-Lin']","['Li CY', 'Meng FY', 'Sun QX', 'Fu YB', 'Jiang QL', 'Yi ZS', 'Song LL']","['Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Nanfang Medical University, Guangzhou, China.']",,['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua xue ye xue za zhi = Zhonghua xueyexue zazhi,8212398,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/metabolism', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Monocytes/cytology/*drug effects/immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2008/05/07 09:00,2009/10/06 06:00,['2008/05/07 09:00'],"['2008/05/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/06 06:00 [medline]', '2008/05/07 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2007 Nov;28(11):762-5.,11,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: One hundred and twenty untreated acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients were diagnosed by standard bone marrow smear morphologic analysis and peroxidase staining. Flow cytometry and myeloid monoclonal antibodies (McAb) were used to analyze immunophenotype. Chromosome karyotypes were analyzed by R-band technique. RESULTS: Of 120 cases, 66 (55%) were My+ ALL, including 50 cases of My+ B-ALL (56.8% of B-ALL ), 14 cases of My T-ALL (50% of T-ALL) and 2 cases of My+ T and B-ALL (50% of T and BALL). Of 66 My+ ALL, 10 cases (15.1%) were misdiagnosed as acute non-lymphoblastic leukemia (ANLL), the other 54 My- ALL cases were correctly diagnosed. The inconsistent rate between morphological and immunophenotype classifications was higher in My+ ALL than in My- ALL , and there were more atypical morphology cases in My+ ALL than in My- ALL (P < 0.01). In My+ ALL cases 95.5% expressed CD13, 81.8% CD33, 77.3% CD13 and CD33 simultaneously, and 1.5% CD117, but none CD14, CD15 and MPO. CD34 expression rate in My+ ALL cases was significantly higher than that in My- ALL (P < 0.01 ). Cytogenetic abnormalities rates in My+ ALL and My- ALL were 72.3% and 66.7% (P > 0.05) respectively. t(9;22) and t(9;22) plus other cytogenetic abnormalities were detected more frequently in My+ LL cases than in My- B-ALL (P < 0. 01), and not in My+ T-ALL and My- T-ALL cases.

HTLV-1 infects 15 to 20million people worldwide, while STLV-1 is endemic in a number of simian or ape species living in Africa or Asia. The high percentage of homologies between HTLV-1 and STLV-1 strains, led to the demonstration that most HTLV-1 subtypes arose from interspecies transmission between monkeys and humans. STLV-3 viruses belong to the third PTLV type and are equally divergent from HTLV-1 than from HTLV-2. They are endemic in several monkey species that live in West, Central, and East Africa. In 2005, we and others reported the discovery of the human homolog (HTLV-3) of STLV-3 in two asymptomatic inhabitants from South Cameroon whose sera exhibited HTLV indeterminate serologies. More recently, we reported a third case of HTLV-3 infection in Cameroon suggesting that this virus is not rare in the human population living in Central Africa. Together with STLV-3, these three human viral strains belong therefore to the PTLV-3 type. A fourth HTLV type (HTLV-4) was also discovered in the same geographical area. Current studies are aimed at determining the prevalence, distribution and modes of transmission of these viruses as well as their possible association with human diseases. Furthermore, molecular characterization of their viral transactivator Tax is ongoing in order to look for possible oncogenic properties.","['Mahieux, R', 'Gessain, Antoine']","['Mahieux R', 'Gessain A']","[""Unite d'epidemiologie et physiopathologie des virus oncogenes, CNRS URA 3015, departement de virologie, Institut Pasteur, 28, rue du Dr-Roux, 75015 Paris, France. rmahieux@pasteur.fr""]",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",France,Pathol Biol (Paris),Pathologie-biologie,0265365,,IM,"['Africa/epidemiology', 'Animals', 'Deltaretrovirus/*classification', 'Deltaretrovirus Infections/epidemiology/veterinary', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/classification', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 2/classification', 'Humans', 'Primate Diseases/epidemiology/virology']",2008/05/06 09:00,2009/07/30 09:00,['2008/05/06 09:00'],"['2008/02/12 00:00 [received]', '2008/02/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/05/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/30 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/06 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0369-8114(08)00039-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.patbio.2008.02.015 [doi]']",ppublish,Pathol Biol (Paris). 2009 Mar;57(2):161-6. doi: 10.1016/j.patbio.2008.02.015.

Allogeneic HSCT from matched unrelated and mismatched donors carries an increased risk of graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) and transplant-related mortality (TRM). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG-Fresenius) at a median dose of 90 mg/kg body weight as part of a total body irradiation or busulfan-based conditioning regimen for prevention of serious GVHD. All patients received cyclosporine A and short-course methotrexate. We compared outcomes of 65 recipients of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-mismatched unrelated grafts and 194 recipients of HLA-matched unrelated grafts. Mismatches involved one or two loci. Both groups were comparable in age, graft source, diagnosis, stage of disease, and conditioning regimen, and differed only in dose of ATG administered. RESULTS: For matched and mismatched transplants, respectively, there was no significant difference in graft failure (0.5% vs 3%; p = 0.16), in the cumulative incidence of grade II to IV acute GVHD (45% vs 35%; p = 0.14) and no difference in overall chronic GVHD (42% vs 40%; p = 0.68). Estimated overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) at 5 years were 55% vs 50% (p = 0.99) and 47% vs 47% (p = 1.0), respectively. The cumulative incidence of relapse and TRM at 5 years were 24% vs 25% (p = 0.63), and 29% vs 27% (p = 0.59), respectively. CONCLUSION: Inclusion of ATG-Fresenius in the conditioning regimen permits HSCT from mismatched unrelated donors without excess TRM and GVHD, resulting in identical OS and DFS of recipients of HLA-matched and HLA-mismatched grafts.","['Ayuk, Francis', 'Diyachenko, Galina', 'Zabelina, Tatjana', 'Panse, Jens', 'Wolschke, Christine', 'Eiermann, Thomas', 'Binder, Thomas', 'Fehse, Boris', 'Erttmann, Rudolf', 'Kabisch, Hartmut', 'Bacher, Ulrike', 'Kroger, Nicolaus', 'Zander, Axel R']","['Ayuk F', 'Diyachenko G', 'Zabelina T', 'Panse J', 'Wolschke C', 'Eiermann T', 'Binder T', 'Fehse B', 'Erttmann R', 'Kabisch H', 'Bacher U', 'Kroger N', 'Zander AR']","['Department of Stem Cell Transplantation, University Medical Center Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany. ayuketan@uke.uni-hamburg.de']",,['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Antilymphocyte Serum)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antilymphocyte Serum/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cyclosporine/therapeutic use', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*prevention & control', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/therapeutic use', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/therapeutic use', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*therapy', 'Survival Rate', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods']",2008/05/06 09:00,2008/09/20 09:00,['2008/05/06 09:00'],"['2007/12/15 00:00 [received]', '2008/01/31 00:00 [revised]', '2008/03/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/05/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/20 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/06 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-472X(08)00125-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2008.03.011 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2008 Aug;36(8):1047-54. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2008.03.011.

We report on a 75-year-old female presenting with a Core-binding Factor (CBF) AML of M4eo subtype. The patient also had jaundice, highly elevated bilirubin, lipase, alkaline phosphatase (AP), CA 19-9, and a pancreatic mass highly suspicious of infiltrating pancreatic carcinoma. However, a biopsy demonstrated granulocytic sarcoma. Since the patient had no comorbidities and had been in excellent performance status until the diagnosis of AML, induction chemotherapy was initiated, with subsequent normalization of bilirubin, CA 19-9, lipase and AP. Complete hematologic remission of AML was attained and the pancreatic mass could not be detected anymore. Retrospective analysis of the c-kit protooncogene did not disclose activating mutations of exons 8 or 17. Following one consolidation treatment, the patient remained in excellent health until relapse occurred 7 months later and she succumbed to AML. In conclusion, AML can rarely mimic the clinical picture of pancreatic cancer.

Artemisinin, a sesquiterpene lactone endoperoxide that exists in several medicinal plants, is a well known anti-malarial agent. We previously reported that artemisinin by itself caused a relatively low level of HL-60 cell differentiation. In this study, we investigated the effects of IFN-alpha in combination with artemisinin on cell growth and differentiation in HL-60 leukemia cells. Combination of IFN-alpha and artemisinin synergistically induced the levels of leukemia cell differentiation, although IFN-alpha by itself did not affect cell proliferation and differentiation. The increased cell differentiation by IFN-alpha and artemisinin was significantly suppressed by the inhibitors for protein kinase C (PKC), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), but not by the inhibitors for phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). Furthermore, co-treatment with IFN-alpha increased levels of PKC alpha and phosphorylated ERK. Taken together, these results indicate the enhancement of artemisinin-induced HL-60 cell differentiation by IFN-alpha through the activation of a PKC alpha/ERK signaling pathway, and suggest a possible use of IFN-alpha and artemisinin in the treatment of leukemic diseases.","['Kim, Seung Hyun', 'Chun, Sang-Young', 'Kim, Tae Sung']","['Kim SH', 'Chun SY', 'Kim TS']","['School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Korea University, Seoul 136-701, Republic of Korea.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Eur J Pharmacol,European journal of pharmacology,1254354,"['0 (Artemisinins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '9RMU91N5K2 (artemisinin)', 'EC 1.2.1.- (Glyceraldehyde-3-Phosphate Dehydrogenases)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C-alpha)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Artemisinins/*pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Glyceraldehyde-3-Phosphate Dehydrogenases/metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/*pharmacology', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase C-alpha/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects']",2008/05/06 09:00,2008/08/30 09:00,['2008/05/06 09:00'],"['2007/07/11 00:00 [received]', '2008/03/04 00:00 [revised]', '2008/03/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/05/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/30 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/06 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0014-2999(08)00364-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ejphar.2008.03.036 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Pharmacol. 2008 Jun 10;587(1-3):65-72. doi: 10.1016/j.ejphar.2008.03.036.

It is generally accepted that somatic mutations occur randomly and that they are generally either ""spontaneous"" or due to various external agents (physical or chemical carcinogens). Constitutional genetic conditions, which modify cancer risk, may become instrumental in opening new concepts in carcinogenesis. For instance, evidence gathered from Down syndrome (DS) individuals has challenged the above perceived explanation since somatic mutations in these patients markedly differ from those arisen in the general population, and do not seem to occur at random. There is no global increase or decrease of somatic mutations in all genes in DS. Instead, specific mutations have been detected on particular loci, depending on the tissue type and the age of the DS person. In the context of constitutional trisomy 21, where cancer have a very particular and striking distribution, biochemical, physiological and architectural imbalances in specific tissues may be responsible for a vulnerable state leading to carcinogenesis. Conversely, in tissues of DS patients which seem resistant to cancer, the proliferative and maturation state of the cells would lead to a refractory state of neoplastic transformation. Experimentally, we observed that the proliferation of tumor cells in extracellular matrix produced by trisomic 21 fibroblasts appears to be inhibited when compared to that of those placed on an extracellular matrix produced by euploid fibroblasts. These observations challenge the current somatic mutation theory of carcinogenesis, and strongly suggest instead a critical role of cells and tissues in the microenvironment where carcinogenesis occurs.","['Satge, Daniel', 'Benard, Jean']","['Satge D', 'Benard J']","['Laboratory of Pathology, Centre Hospitalier, 19012 Tulle, France. daniel.satge@ch-tulle.fr']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Semin Cancer Biol,Seminars in cancer biology,9010218,"['0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Down Syndrome/complications/*genetics/metabolism', 'Extracellular Matrix/*metabolism', 'Fibroblasts/metabolism', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/genetics/metabolism', '*Mutation', 'Neoplasms/*etiology/genetics/pathology', 'Stromal Cells/metabolism/pathology']",2008/05/06 09:00,2008/10/14 09:00,['2008/05/06 09:00'],"['2008/03/19 00:00 [received]', '2008/03/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/05/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/14 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/06 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1044-579X(08)00041-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.semcancer.2008.03.020 [doi]']",ppublish,Semin Cancer Biol. 2008 Oct;18(5):365-71. doi: 10.1016/j.semcancer.2008.03.020.

In this study, we provide the first detailed description of the TGIF locus characterizing 12 TGIF splice isoforms. These isoforms have similar open reading frames but different 5' untranslated regions. TGIF expression data are presented from multiple tissues, cell lines and primary leukemia cells. Isoform-specific real-time PCR analysis showed that even though these isoforms were broadly expressed all except isoform 4, had very low level of expression. In fact, isoform 4 was the predominant TGIF isoform expressed in all tissues analyzed. Since TGIF, levels have recently implicated to play a role in acute myelogenous leukemia we proceeded to characterize the minimal promoter region of isoform 4 as a first step in understanding mechanisms of TGIF expression. As expected for homeobox genes, the minimal promoter region for isoform 4 has multiple Sp1 binding sites and a CpG island raising the possibility that the low TGIF expression seen in some AML patients and leukemia cell lines may be secondary to methylation. Further characterization of expression from this promoter using 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine treatment and transient expression assays showed that decreased TGIF expression is likely secondary to active repression and not because of promoter methylation. A detailed characterization of this complex locus is important as it may help to clarify the functions of this gene in brain development and leukemia biology.","['Hamid, Rizwan', 'Patterson, Johnequia', 'Brandt, Stephen J']","['Hamid R', 'Patterson J', 'Brandt SJ']","['Department of Pediatrics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee 37232, USA. rizwan.hamid@vanderbilt.edu']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (TGIF1 protein, human)']",IM,"[""5' Flanking Region"", '*Alternative Splicing', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Genomics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Isoforms/genetics/metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/*genetics/metabolism']",2008/05/06 09:00,2008/07/09 09:00,['2008/05/06 09:00'],"['2008/02/26 00:00 [received]', '2008/03/26 00:00 [revised]', '2008/04/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/05/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/09 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/06 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1874-9399(08)00090-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbagrm.2008.04.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 2008 May;1779(5):347-55. doi: 10.1016/j.bbagrm.2008.04.003.

Although vaccines are available for both viruses, identification and segregation of infected cats form the cornerstone for preventing new infections. Guidelines in this report have been developed for diagnosis, prevention, treatment, and management of FeLV and FIV infections. All cats should be tested for FeLV and FIV infections at appropriate intervals based on individual risk assessments. This includes testing at the time of acquisition, following exposure to an infected cat or a cat of unknown infection status, prior to vaccination against FeLV or FIV, prior to entering group housing, and when cats become sick. No test is 100% accurate at all times under all conditions; results should be interpreted along with the patient's health and risk factors. Retroviral tests can diagnose only infection, not clinical disease, and cats infected with FeLV or FIV may live for many years. A decision for euthanasia should never be based solely on whether or not the cat is infected. Vaccination against FeLV is highly recommended in kittens. In adult cats, antiretroviral vaccines are considered non-core and should be administered only if a risk assessment indicates they are appropriate. Few large controlled studies have been performed using antiviral or immunomodulating drugs for the treatment of naturally infected cats. More research is needed to identify best practices to improve long-term outcomes following retroviral infections in cats.","['Levy, Julie', 'Crawford, Cynda', 'Hartmann, Katrin', 'Hofmann-Lehmann, Regina', 'Little, Susan', 'Sundahl, Eliza', 'Thayer, Vicki']","['Levy J', 'Crawford C', 'Hartmann K', 'Hofmann-Lehmann R', 'Little S', 'Sundahl E', 'Thayer V']","['Department of Small Animal Clinical Sciences, College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL 32610, USA. levyj@vetmed.ufl.edu']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Feline Med Surg,Journal of feline medicine and surgery,100897329,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cats', 'Feline Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/*diagnosis/*therapy', 'Immunodeficiency Virus, Feline/*isolation & purification', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/*isolation & purification', 'Leukemia, Feline/*diagnosis/*therapy', '*Practice Guidelines as Topic', ""Practice Patterns, Physicians'"", 'Tumor Virus Infections/veterinary', 'United States']",2008/05/06 09:00,2008/11/05 09:00,['2008/05/06 09:00'],"['2008/03/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/05/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/11/05 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/06 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1098-612X(08)00072-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jfms.2008.03.002 [doi]']",ppublish,J Feline Med Surg. 2008 Jul;10(3):300-16. doi: 10.1016/j.jfms.2008.03.002.

Gleevec has been designed to treat many CML patients by specifically targeting Bcr-Abl, but resistance to it is already apparent in many cases. In CML cells, Bcr-Abl activates several signaling pathways, including the Ras-dependent pathway, in which growth factor receptor binding 2 (Grb2) acts as an adaptor protein. A specific Grb2-SH3 inhibitor (denoted as peptidimer-c) that disrupts Grb2-Sos complex was designed and synthesized in our laboratory. In this study, we investigated the effect and the molecular mechanism of this inhibitor. Peptidimer-c was shown to bind to Grb2 in K562 cells, a cell line over-expressing Bcr-Abl oncoprotein. It caused cytotoxicity in the cells, and inhibited their ability of colony formation in the semi-solid medium. It was shown to induce apoptosis of K562 cells in a dose-dependent mode, the apoptotic effect of peptidimer-c being associated with caspase-3 activation. The effect of peptidimer-c on growth inhibition was also shown to be accompanied by S-phase arrest of cell cycle mediated by down-regulation of cyclin A and Cdk2, as well as phospho-Cdk2. The above results indicated that peptidimer-c may be another potential therapeutic agent for CML, which can induce S-phase arrest in the Bcr-Abl positive K562.","['Ye, Yun-Bin', 'Lin, Jian-Yin', 'Chen, Qiang', 'Liu, Fang', 'Chen, Hui-Jing', 'Li, Jie-Yu', 'Liu, Wang-Qing', 'Garbay, Christiane', 'Vidal, Michel']","['Ye YB', 'Lin JY', 'Chen Q', 'Liu F', 'Chen HJ', 'Li JY', 'Liu WQ', 'Garbay C', 'Vidal M']","['Universite Paris Descartes, Laboratoire de Pharmacochime Moleculaire et Cellulaire, INSERM U648, 45 Rue des Saints Peres, Paris 75006, France.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cell-Penetrating Peptides)', '0 (Cyclin A)', '0 (GRB2 Adaptor Protein)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (peptidimer-c)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'A2AQZ20TEK (penetratin)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzamides', 'Carrier Proteins/pharmacology', 'Caspase 3/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell-Penetrating Peptides', 'Cyclin A/genetics/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Down-Regulation', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*metabolism', 'GRB2 Adaptor Protein/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'K562 Cells', 'Peptide Fragments/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Peptides/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'Time Factors', 'src Homology Domains/*drug effects']",2008/05/06 09:00,2008/06/14 09:00,['2008/05/06 09:00'],"['2007/05/14 00:00 [received]', '2007/11/25 00:00 [revised]', '2007/12/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/05/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/14 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/06 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-2952(08)00165-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bcp.2007.12.021 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2008 Jun 1;75(11):2080-91. doi: 10.1016/j.bcp.2007.12.021.

Since this epigenetic change is reversible, it is a potential target for chemotherapeutic intervention using an inhibitor of DNA methylation, such as 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (DAC). Although clinical studies show that DAC has activity against hematological malignancies, the optimal dose-schedule of this epigenetic agent still needs to be established. METHODS: Clonogenic assays were performed on leukemic and tumor cell lines to evaluate the in vitro antineoplastic activity of DAC. The reactivation of TSGs and inhibition of DNA methylation by DAC were investigated by reverse transcriptase-PCR and Line-1 assays. The in vivo antineoplastic activity of DAC administered as an i.v. infusion was evaluated in mice with murine L1210 leukemia by measurement of survival time, and in mice bearing murine EMT6 mammary tumor by excision of tumor after chemotherapy for an in vitro clonogenic assay. RESULTS: Increasing the DAC concentration and duration of exposure produced a greater loss of clonogenicity for both human leukemic and tumor cell lines. The reactivation of the TSGs (p57KIP2 in HL-60 leukemic cells and p16CDKN2A in Calu-6 lung carcinoma cells) and the inhibition of global DNA methylation in HL-60 leukemic cells increased with DAC concentration. In mice with L1210 leukemia and in mice bearing EMT6 tumors, the antineoplastic action of DAC also increased with the dose. The plasma level of DAC that produced a very potent antineoplastic effect in mice with leukemia or solid tumors was > 200 ng/ml (> 1 microM). CONCLUSION: We have shown that intensification of the DAC dose markedly increased its antineoplastic activity in mouse models of cancer. Our data also show that there is a good correlation between the concentrations of DAC that reduce in vitro clonogenicity, reactivate TSGs and inhibit DNA methylation. These results suggest that the antineoplastic action of DAC is related to its epigenetic action. Our observations provide a strong rationale to perform clinical trials using dose intensification of DAC to maximize the chemotherapeutic potential of this epigenetic agent in patients with cancer.","['Lemaire, Maryse', 'Chabot, Guy G', 'Raynal, Noel Jm', 'Momparler, Louise F', 'Hurtubise, Annie', 'Bernstein, Mark L', 'Momparler, Richard L']","['Lemaire M', 'Chabot GG', 'Raynal NJ', 'Momparler LF', 'Hurtubise A', 'Bernstein ML', 'Momparler RL']","[""Departement de pharmacologie, Universite de Montreal, Centre de recherche pediatrique, Service d'Hematologie-Oncologie, Hopital Sainte-Justine, 3175 Cote Sainte-Catherine, Montreal, Quebec H3T 1C5, Canada. maryse_lemaire@yahoo.fr""]",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor Proteins)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics', 'Azacitidine/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor Proteins/metabolism', 'DNA Methylation/drug effects', 'Decitabine', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Epigenesis, Genetic/*drug effects', 'Genomic Imprinting/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/drug therapy/pathology', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",2008/05/06 09:00,2009/03/03 09:00,['2008/05/06 09:00'],"['2007/11/01 00:00 [received]', '2008/05/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/05/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/03/03 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/06 09:00 [entrez]']","['1471-2407-8-128 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2407-8-128 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2008 May 2;8:128. doi: 10.1186/1471-2407-8-128.,,,,,20080502,PMC2386792,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Two hundred forty-three children were newly diagnosed ALL in a university hospital from May 1999 to August 2006. Three protocols were offered to the patients: China-98 protocol, or modified ALLIC BFM2002 protocol, or an in-house Reduced Intensity Protocol (or also known as Economic Protocol). RESULTS: Among 243 patients, 19 abandoned treatment, 3 transferred to other hospitals, 48 were high-risk and were treated with the high risk protocol, and 4 had mature B-ALL. A total of 169 cases were enrolled on non-high risk protocols: 46 treated on China-98 protocol, 73 on modified ALLIC BFM2002 and 50 from low income families on Economic Protocol. The event-free survival (EFS) at 4 years was 80.4% (95%CI, 68.8-92.2%), 83.5% (95%CI, 73.5-93.5%), and 72.8% (95%CI, 59.3-86.3%) for China-98 protocol, modified ALLIC BFM2002, and Economic Protocol respectively. The hospitalization costs (range and median) were significantly different between protocols: US$ 8,700-25,500 (12,500), US$ 6,900-16,400 (9,900), US$ 3,100-6,800 (4,300) for China-98 protocol, modified ALLIC BFM2002, and Economic Protocol respectively. CONCLUSION: This report from China has systematically reviewed the outcome and costs of protocols for ALL having different dose intensity. The reduced intensity protocol appears to achieve reasonable EFS (72.8% at 4 years) for non-high risk ALL at a much lower cost. This is especially important for low income families in developing countries.","['Luo, Xue-Qun', 'Ke, Zhi-Yong', 'Guan, Xiao-Qing', 'Zhang, Ying-Chuang', 'Huang, Li-Bin', 'Zhu, Jia']","['Luo XQ', 'Ke ZY', 'Guan XQ', 'Zhang YC', 'Huang LB', 'Zhu J']","['Department of Pediatrics, The First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China.']",,['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hospitalization', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Sepsis/epidemiology', 'Treatment Outcome']",2008/05/06 09:00,2008/06/25 09:00,['2008/05/06 09:00'],"['2008/05/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/25 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/06 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.21598 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2008 Aug;51(2):204-9. doi: 10.1002/pbc.21598.,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, data on the relation between DM and HZ are scarce. This case-control study explored the association between DM and HZ. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study was nested within a cohort of all members of a large health maintenance organization (HMO) in Israel. Cases totaled 22,294 members who were diagnosed with HZ between 2002 and 2006. Controls (n=88,895) were randomly selected from the remaining HMO population using frequency-matched age, sex, and duration of follow-up. Personal data on history of DM, lymphoma, leukemia, or AIDS, were obtained from computerized medical records. RESULTS: Adjusted analyses showed that the risk of HZ was associated with history of leukemia, lymphoma, use of steroids or antineoplastic medications, and AIDS, particularly among patients below 45 years of age. In a multivariate analysis, DM was associated with an increased risk of HZ (OR=1.53; 95% CI: 1.44-1.62). CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest that individuals with DM are at increased risk of HZ. Well-designed cohort studies may help to clarify the nature of this association.","['Heymann, A D', 'Chodick, G', 'Karpati, T', 'Kamer, L', 'Kremer, E', 'Green, M S', 'Kokia, E', 'Shalev, V']","['Heymann AD', 'Chodick G', 'Karpati T', 'Kamer L', 'Kremer E', 'Green MS', 'Kokia E', 'Shalev V']","['Medical Division, Maccabi Healthcare Services, 27 HaMered St, Tel Aviv, 68125, Israel.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Infection,Infection,0365307,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Diabetes Complications/*epidemiology/immunology', 'Female', 'Herpes Zoster/*epidemiology/*etiology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Israel/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Population Surveillance', 'Risk Factors']",2008/05/06 09:00,2008/11/18 09:00,['2008/05/06 09:00'],"['2006/11/30 00:00 [received]', '2007/09/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/05/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/11/18 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/06 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s15010-007-6347-x [doi]'],ppublish,Infection. 2008 Jun;36(3):226-30. doi: 10.1007/s15010-007-6347-x.

This trial was designed to investigate sequential topoisomerase targeting in the treatment of patients with high-risk acute myelogenous leukemia. An initial cohort of patients received topotecan and cytosine arabinoside daily for 5 days. Serial samples of circulating mononuclear cells were examined to evaluate peak elevations of TOP2-alpha protein expression. In subsequent cohorts, etoposide was administered daily for 3 days, beginning 6 h after initiation of the topotecan infusion. The etoposide dose was escalated to determine a maximum-tolerated dose. Circulating mononuclear cells were analyzed for TOP1 mutations and ABCG2 protein expression. In addition, systemic and intracellular topotecan concentrations were measured. Thirty-one patients were enrolled. On the basis of TOP1-alpha protein levels in three patients with peripheral blast counts greater than 50%, etoposide administration began 6 h after initiation of the topotecan/cytosine arabinoside infusion. Using this schedule of administration, the maximum-tolerated dose of etoposide was 90 mg/m. No TOP1 mutations were identified, but increases in ABCG2 expression during the infusion were observed in mononuclear cells from two of four evaluable patients. Administration of etoposide 6 h after initiation of a topotecan/cytosine arabinoside infusion is feasible and is associated with clinical activity. Analysis of TOP2-alpha protein levels in this small number of patients indicated that peak increases occurred earlier than expected based on earlier publications. Upregulation of ABCG2 was detected in circulating cells and may represent an inducible form of drug resistance that should be investigated further.","['Saraiya, Biren', 'Gounder, Murugesan', 'Dutta, Jayeeta', 'Saleem, Ahamed', 'Collazo, Celeste', 'Zimmerman, Luz', 'Nazar, Ahamed', 'Gharibo, Mecide', 'Schaar, Dale', 'Lin, Yong', 'Shih, Weichung', 'Aisner, Joseph', 'Strair, Roger K', 'Rubin, Eric H']","['Saraiya B', 'Gounder M', 'Dutta J', 'Saleem A', 'Collazo C', 'Zimmerman L', 'Nazar A', 'Gharibo M', 'Schaar D', 'Lin Y', 'Shih W', 'Aisner J', 'Strair RK', 'Rubin EH']","['Departments of Medicine and Pharmacology, The Cancer Institute of New Jersey, Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, New Brunswick, New Jersey 08903, USA.']",,['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Anticancer Drugs,Anti-cancer drugs,9100823,"['0 (ABCG2 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2)', '0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Poly-ADP-Ribose Binding Proteins)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '7M7YKX2N15 (Topotecan)', 'EC 5.99.1.2 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type I)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (TOP2A protein, human)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2', 'ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/biosynthesis', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type I/genetics/metabolism', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Drug Administration Schedule', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Poly-ADP-Ribose Binding Proteins', 'Topotecan/*administration & dosage/pharmacology']",2008/05/06 09:00,2008/07/29 09:00,['2008/05/06 09:00'],"['2008/05/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/29 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/06 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/CAD.0b013e3282f5218b [doi]', '00001813-200804000-00009 [pii]']",ppublish,Anticancer Drugs. 2008 Apr;19(4):411-20. doi: 10.1097/CAD.0b013e3282f5218b.,4,,,['CA71535/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CD22-specific cTCR targeting different epitopes of the CD22 molecule promoted efficient lysis of target cells expressing high levels of CD22 with a maximum lytic potential that appeared to decrease as the distance of the target epitope from the target cell membrane increased. Targeting membrane-distal CD22 epitopes with cTCR(+) CTL revealed defects in both degranulation and lytic granule targeting. CD22-specific cTCR(+) CTL exhibited lower levels of maximum lysis and lower Ag sensitivity than CTL targeting CD20, which has a shorter extracellular domain than CD22. This diminished sensitivity was not a result of reduced avidity of Ag engagement, but instead reflected weaker signaling per triggered cTCR molecule when targeting membrane-distal epitopes of CD22. Both of these parameters were restored by targeting a ligand expressing the same epitope, but constructed as a truncated CD22 molecule to approximate the length of a TCR:peptide-MHC complex. The reduced sensitivity of CD22-specific cTCR(+) CTL for Ag-induced triggering of effector functions has potential therapeutic applications, because such cells selectively lysed B cell lymphoma lines expressing high levels of CD22, but demonstrated minimal activity against autologous normal B cells, which express lower levels of CD22. Thus, our results demonstrate that cTCR signal strength, and consequently Ag sensitivity, can be modulated by differential choice of target epitopes with respect to distance from the cell membrane, allowing discrimination between targets with disparate Ag density.","['James, Scott E', 'Greenberg, Philip D', 'Jensen, Michael C', 'Lin, Yukang', 'Wang, Jinjuan', 'Till, Brian G', 'Raubitschek, Andrew A', 'Forman, Stephen J', 'Press, Oliver W']","['James SE', 'Greenberg PD', 'Jensen MC', 'Lin Y', 'Wang J', 'Till BG', 'Raubitschek AA', 'Forman SJ', 'Press OW']","['Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA 98109, USA.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",IM,"['Antigens, Neoplasm/immunology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Membrane/chemistry', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte/chemistry/*immunology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/*methods', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/therapy', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/therapy', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*chemistry/genetics/*immunology']",2008/05/06 09:00,2008/06/20 09:00,['2008/05/06 09:00'],"['2008/05/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/06 09:00 [entrez]']","['180/10/7028 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.180.10.7028 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2008 May 15;180(10):7028-38. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.180.10.7028.,10,,,"['R37 CA033084-18/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA117131-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P51 RR000166/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA 117131/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA033084-21/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA076287-06/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA076287-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA018029-270051/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA076287-07/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA033084-22/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA076287-05A1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA033084-20/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA033084-23/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA076287-10/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA076287-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA018029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA018029-240041/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA033084-24/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA018029-230041/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA076287/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA033084/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA076287-09/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA117131/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 33084/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA033084/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA033084-19/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA076287-08/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA033084-25A1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA018029-320048/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA018029-24S10041/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA018029-22A10041/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA018029-260041/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA018029-250041/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA076287-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA 76287/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA117131-01A1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA033084-17/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 18029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC2585549,['NIHMS42763'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the accumulating evidence supports a role of Abi1 in actin cytoskeleton remodeling and growth factor/receptor signaling, it is not clear how it contributes to Bcr-Abl-induced leukemogenesis. We show here that Abi1 gene silencing by short hairpin RNA attenuated the Bcr-Abl-induced abnormal actin remodeling, membrane-type 1 metalloproteinase clustering and inhibited cell adhesion and migration on fibronectin-coated surfaces. Although the knock down of Abi1 expression did not affect growth factor-independent growth of Bcr-Abl-transformed Ba/F3 cells in vitro, it impeded competitive expansion of these cells in non obese diabetic (NOD)/ severe combined immuno-deficiency (SCID) mice. Remarkably, the knock down of Abi1 expression in Bcr-Abl-transformed Ba/F3 cells impaired the leukemogenic potential of these cells in NOD/SCID mice. Abi1 contributes to Bcr-Abl-induced leukemogenesis in part through Src family kinases, as the knock down of Abi1 expression attenuates Bcr-Abl-stimulated activation of Lyn. Together, these data provide for the first time the direct evidence that supports a critical role of Abi1 pathway in the pathogenesis of Bcr-Abl-induced leukemia.","['Yu, Weidong', 'Sun, Xiaolin', 'Clough, Nancy', 'Cobos, Everardo', 'Tao, Yunxia', 'Dai, Zonghan']","['Yu W', 'Sun X', 'Clough N', 'Cobos E', 'Tao Y', 'Dai Z']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, 1400 Wallace Boulevard, Amarillo, TX 79106, USA.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",England,Carcinogenesis,Carcinogenesis,8008055,"['0 (Abi1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Cytoskeletal Proteins)', '0 (Mmp14 protein, mouse)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (lyn protein-tyrosine kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.24.80 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 14)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Adhesion/physiology', 'Cell Movement/*physiology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Cytoskeletal Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*physiology', '*Gene Silencing', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Leukemia/genetics/*pathology', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 14/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Phosphorylation', 'Precursor Cells, B-Lymphoid/*pathology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/*pharmacology', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Survival Rate', 'Tyrosine/metabolism', 'src-Family Kinases/metabolism']",2008/05/06 09:00,2008/10/22 09:00,['2008/05/06 09:00'],"['2008/05/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/22 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/06 09:00 [entrez]']","['bgn098 [pii]', '10.1093/carcin/bgn098 [doi]']",ppublish,Carcinogenesis. 2008 Sep;29(9):1717-24. doi: 10.1093/carcin/bgn098.

This report describes the effect of palifermin in patients treated within the GMALL-B-ALL 2002 protocol containing HD-MTX who developed a severe mucositis in cycle A1/B1. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Ten patients, all with World Health Organization grades III-IV oral mucositis in cycles A1/B1, obtained palifermin with subsequent similar or identical cycles to reduce mucositis. Thus, patients serve as their own control for efficacy of palifermin. RESULTS: All 10 patients developed grades III-IV mucositis in cycles A1/B1 without palifermin, whereas only two of 10 developed grades III-IV mucositis in corresponding cycles A2/B2 with palifermin. Only four of 10 patients showed infections in the cycles with palifermin compared with 10 of 10 patients without palifermin. The duration of mucositits in patients who acquired a higher grade mucositis despite treatment with palifermin could be reduced from 12.9 days (median) without to 11 days with palifermin. The amount of i.v. opioid analgetics could be significantly reduced. CONCLUSION: Palifermin might reduce the incidence, severeness and duration of oral mucositis in HD-MTX-based chemotherapy and may influence clinical sequelae such as infection and quality of life.","['Schmidt, E', 'Thoennissen, N H', 'Rudat, A', 'Bieker, R', 'Schliemann, C', 'Mesters, R M', 'Zuhlsdorf, M', 'Muller-Tidow, C', 'Berdel, W E']","['Schmidt E', 'Thoennissen NH', 'Rudat A', 'Bieker R', 'Schliemann C', 'Mesters RM', 'Zuhlsdorf M', 'Muller-Tidow C', 'Berdel WE']","['Department of Medicine, Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Muenster, Muenster, Germany.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Ann Oncol,Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology,9007735,"['126469-10-1 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 7)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 7/*administration & dosage', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Middle Aged', 'Pain Measurement', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/pathology', 'Reference Values', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Assessment', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Statistics, Nonparametric', 'Stomatitis/*chemically induced/physiopathology/*prevention & control', 'Treatment Outcome']",2008/05/06 09:00,2008/10/28 09:00,['2008/05/06 09:00'],"['2008/05/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/28 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/06 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0923-7534(19)40215-9 [pii]', '10.1093/annonc/mdn179 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Oncol. 2008 Sep;19(9):1644-9. doi: 10.1093/annonc/mdn179.

Cord blood stem cells are routinely utilized in stem cell transplantation in leukemia patients and carry huge potential to treat other human diseases with less concern of rejection. Because UCB contains low number of stem cells, their use is associated with significant delays in engraftment of neutrophils and platelets.

Several neuraminidase (NA) assays are available for the evaluation of NAIs. To understand the NAI functions under physiological conditions, assays mimicking viral particle release should be useful. We have constructed retrovirus-based reporter viruses that are pseudotyped with hemagglutinin (HA) glycoprotein by transfection of producer cells using plasmids expressing retroviral gag-pol, influenza HA, NA, and firefly luciferase genes. Similarly to the life cycle of influenza viruses, the release of pseudotype viruses also requires neuraminidase functions. This requirement was used to develop an assay to evaluate NAI activities by measuring inhibition of pseudotype virus production at different NAI concentrations. The pseudotype virus release assay was used to determine the IC(50) values of Oseltamivir carboxylate, Zanamivir, and the novel phosphonate congeners of Oseltamivir against N1 group neuraminidases and their H274Y Oseltamivir carboxylate-resistant mutants. The deduced IC(50) values obtained using the release assay correlated with those determined using the fluorogenic substrate 2'-(4-methylumbelliferyl)-alpha-d-N-acetylneuraminic acid (MUNANA) and also correlated with the infectivity results.","['Su, Ching-Yao', 'Wang, Shi-Yun', 'Shie, Jiun-Jie', 'Jeng, King-Song', 'Temperton, Nigel J', 'Fang, Jim-Min', 'Wong, Chi-Huey', 'Cheng, Yih-Shyun E']","['Su CY', 'Wang SY', 'Shie JJ', 'Jeng KS', 'Temperton NJ', 'Fang JM', 'Wong CH', 'Cheng YS']","['Genomics Research Center, Academia Sinica, 128 Academia Road, Section 2, Taipei 115, Taiwan.']",,['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Antiviral Res,Antiviral research,8109699,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Hemagglutinins, Viral)', '20O93L6F9H (Oseltamivir)', 'EC 3.2.1.18 (Neuraminidase)', 'L6O3XI777I (Zanamivir)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antiviral Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Chick Embryo', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Genes, Reporter/drug effects', 'Genetic Engineering', 'Hemagglutinins, Viral/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Influenza, Human/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics/metabolism', 'Neuraminidase/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Orthomyxoviridae/*drug effects/enzymology/physiology', 'Oseltamivir/pharmacology', 'Virus Shedding/drug effects', 'Zanamivir/pharmacology']",2008/05/03 09:00,2008/10/03 09:00,['2008/05/03 09:00'],"['2007/10/29 00:00 [received]', '2008/03/14 00:00 [revised]', '2008/03/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/05/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/03 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0166-3542(08)00263-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.antiviral.2008.03.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Antiviral Res. 2008 Sep;79(3):199-205. doi: 10.1016/j.antiviral.2008.03.002.

However, drug resistance may occur after several cycles of 5-FU-based chemotherapy. The oncogene B-cell-specific Moloney murine leukemia virus insertion site 1 (BMI-1) has been shown to be involved in the protection of cancer cells from apoptosis. In this study, 5-FU treatment could increase the percentage of apoptotic NPC cells among BMI-1/RNAi-transfected cells than that among cells transfected with the empty vector. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) values of 5-FU were significantly decreased to a greater extent in the cells transfected with BMI-1/RNAi.

The genetic associations of polymorphisms in MCL1 with clinical TB patients (n=486) and normal controls (n=370) were analyzed. Using statistical analyses, one common promoter polymorphism (MCL1- 324C > A) which is absolutely linked with three other SNPs in the promoter and 3'UTR regions, were found to be significantly associated with increased risk of clinical TB disease. The frequency of the A-bearing genotype of -324C > A was higher in clinical TB patients than in normal controls (P=0.0008, OR= 1.68).

However, the role of humoral responses in HSP-based autologous tumor immunotherapy remains unclear. In the present study, we investigated whether leukemia-specific antibodies and antibody-mediated cytotoxicity against autologous leukemia cells have a crucial role in a mouse A20 leukemia model by immunizing A20-derived HSP70. Immunization with A20-derived HSP70 induced the production of anti-A20-antibodies and the antibodies recognized HSP70-binding peptides derived from A20. One of those was a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class-I binding peptide, which has been clarified as the target peptide of CD8+ cytotoxic T-cells (CTL) against A20. The anti-A20-antibodies produced by immunization with A20-derived HSP70 induced complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) against A20 in vitro. In addition, immunization with A20-derived HSP70 increased intracellular interleukin-4 (IL4)-production of CD4(+) T-cells, confirming the activation of type-2 helper T-cells. Taken together, immunization with leukemia-cell-derived HSP70 induces antibodies against leukemia-cell-specific peptides and might play a crucial role in the eradication of leukemia cells by CDC in mice. These findings will enable future establishment of a novel therapeutic strategy using antileukemia antibodies in HSP-based autologous tumor immunotherapy.","['Jimbo, Junko', 'Sato, Kazuya', 'Hosoki, Takaaki', 'Shindo, Motohiro', 'Ikuta, Katsuya', 'Torimoto, Yoshihiro', 'Kohgo, Yutaka']","['Jimbo J', 'Sato K', 'Hosoki T', 'Shindo M', 'Ikuta K', 'Torimoto Y', 'Kohgo Y']","['Division of Gastroenterology and Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, Asahikawa Medical College, Asahikawa, Japan.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,"['0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Cancer Vaccines)', '0 (HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/*blood', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Cancer Vaccines/*immunology', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins/*immunology', 'Immunization', 'Immunoglobulin G/blood', 'Interleukin-4/biosynthesis', 'Leukemia/immunology/*therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C']",2008/05/03 09:00,2008/06/18 09:00,['2008/05/03 09:00'],"['2008/05/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/18 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['CAS829 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1349-7006.2008.00829.x [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2008 Jul;99(7):1427-34. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.2008.00829.x.

In this study, we identified a CD4 T-cell epitope peptide in the tumor rejection antigen RLakt on BALB/c radiation-leukemia RL male 1. Analyses of the recognition of a bulk CD4 T-cell line using several recombinant RLakt proteins suggested the presence of multiple CD4 T-cell epitopes in the molecule. However, cloning from a bulk CD4 T-cell line resulted in only two clones from 200 wells seeded at three cells per well, and those two CD4 T-cell clones recognized the same epitope peptide in RLakt. The epitope peptide was 14-mer p12-25, AYREETLSIIPGLP, and its recognition was H-2IA(d)-restricted. This sequence overlapped with the CD8 T-cell epitope pRL1a in its N-terminal 5 amino acid residues.

It is believed that in the blast crisis (BC) terminal phase of the disease, blood-circulating blasts represent an expansion of a single CML clone. However, although these blasts grow mostly in suspension under standard culture conditions, a relatively small cell-fraction adheres to the plastic dish. Yet, it is unknown whether these two cell-fractions are distinct sub-populations that originated from a common CML clone and whether they have different biological and malignant properties. To address these questions, we have characterized the plastic-adherent and non-adherent sub-populations of various cell lines and primary cells derived from patients with CML in BC. This study indicated that the adherent-subsets retain repopulating ability with indications of increased malignant properties as greater anchorage-independent clonogenicity, impairment of cell-cell contact inhibition, loss of serum-dependent attenuation of plastic-adhesion, and a significant up-regulation of the oncogenes BCR-ABL, c-JUN, and c-FOS along with the adhesion-related genes KiSS-1, THBS3, and ITGB5. The adherent blasts stably retain their unique properties even after elimination of the adherence selection pressure. Sub-cloning analyses indicated that the adherent cells could be continuously evolved from any parental non-adherent clone in a unidirectional manner. This study provides new insights into the biology and the malignant evolution of CML, indicating that at the BC phase, circulating blasts are heterogeneous and consisting of at least two distinct populations of a common clonal origin. The existence of a minor ""pool"" of blasts of greater clonogenic capacity along with significantly higher expression level of BCR-ABL, individually or in conjunction with other cancer and adhesion-related genes, might also signify clonal evolution toward subsequent increased malignancy and lower therapeutic sensitivity.","['Simanovsky, Masha', 'Berlinsky, Sagi', 'Sinai, Pirchia', 'Leiba, Merav', 'Nagler, Arnon', 'Galski, Hanan']","['Simanovsky M', 'Berlinsky S', 'Sinai P', 'Leiba M', 'Nagler A', 'Galski H']","['Division of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Laboratory of Molecular Immunobiology, Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel Hashomer, Israel.']",,['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Differentiation,Differentiation; research in biological diversity,0401650,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Blast Crisis/*genetics/*pathology', 'Cell Adhesion/genetics', 'Clone Cells', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*physiology', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/metabolism/*pathology', '*Phenotype', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Up-Regulation/genetics']",2008/05/03 09:00,2008/12/18 09:00,['2008/05/03 09:00'],"['2008/05/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/18 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-4681(09)60029-3 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1432-0436.2008.00270.x [doi]']",ppublish,Differentiation. 2008 Oct;76(8):908-22. doi: 10.1111/j.1432-0436.2008.00270.x.

Acetylation of histones is a key event after treatment with HDAC inhibitors, and could thus be used as a marker for monitoring cellular response to HDAC inhibitor treatment. Here we describe the utility of a newly described monoclonal antibody against acetylated H4 for immunohistochemistry on paraffin-embedded fine needle biopsies from nude mice carrying A2780 human ovarian cancer xenografts. Acetylated H4 was monitored in vivo by immunohistochemistry during treatment with belinostat, and compared with pharmacokinetics in plasma and tumor tissue. We found an increased level of acetylated H4 15 min after a single treatment (200 mg/kg i.v.) with maximum level reached after 1 h. H4 acetylation intensity reflected the belinostat concentration in plasma and tumor tissue. The threshold level for belinostat activity, indicated by acetylated H4, correlated with belinostat plasma concentrations above 1,000 ng/ml. In conclusion, examination of H4 acetylation in fine needle biopsies using the T25 antibody may prove useful in monitoring HDAC inhibitor efficacy in clinical trials involving humans with solid tumors.","['Marquard, Lena', 'Petersen, Kamille Dumong', 'Persson, Morten', 'Hoff, Kirsten Damgaard', 'Jensen, Peter Buhl', 'Sehested, Maxwell']","['Marquard L', 'Petersen KD', 'Persson M', 'Hoff KD', 'Jensen PB', 'Sehested M']","['Experimental Pathology Unit, Copenhagen University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark. lmi@topotarget.com']",,['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Denmark,APMIS,"APMIS : acta pathologica, microbiologica, et immunologica Scandinavica",8803400,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)', 'F4H96P17NZ (belinostat)']",IM,"['Acetylation/drug effects', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antineoplastic Agents/blood/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Breast Neoplasms/drug therapy/enzymology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Female', 'HCT116 Cells', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Histone Deacetylases/immunology', 'Histones/immunology/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/blood/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia P388/drug therapy/enzymology', 'Liver Neoplasms, Experimental/drug therapy/enzymology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*drug therapy/enzymology/*metabolism', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/drug therapy/enzymology', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/drug therapy/enzymology', 'Sulfonamides', 'Transplantation, Heterologous']",2008/05/03 09:00,2008/06/27 09:00,['2008/05/03 09:00'],"['2008/05/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/27 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['APM957 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-0463.2008.00957.x [doi]']",ppublish,APMIS. 2008 May;116(5):382-92. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0463.2008.00957.x.,5,,,,,PMC2774150,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The clinical question at issue is to enable prediction of the complete remission (CR) duration for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. This would facilitate disease prognosis and make individual therapy possible. SELDI-mass spectrometry proteomics analyses were performed on blast cell samples collected from AML patients pre-chemotherapy. Although the biobank available included approximately 200 samples, only 58 were available for analysis. The presented workflow includes sample selection, experimental optimization, repeatability estimation, data preprocessing, data fusion, and feature selection. Specific difficulties have been the small number of samples and the skew distribution of the CR duration among the patients. Further, we had to deal with both noisy SELDI-MS data and a diverse patient cohort. This has been handled by sample selection and several methods for data preprocessing and feature detection in the analysis workflow. Four conceptually different methods for peak detection and alignment were considered, as well as two diverse methods for feature selection. The peak detection and alignment methods included the recently developed annotated regions of significance (ARS) method, the SELDI-MS software Ciphergen Express which was regarded as the standard method, segment-wise spectral alignment by a genetic algorithm (PAGA) followed by binning, and, finally, binning of raw data. In the feature selection, the ""standard"" Mann-Whitney t test was compared with a hierarchical orthogonal partial least-squares (O-PLS) analysis approach. The combined information from all these analyses gave a collection of 21 protein peaks. These were regarded as the most potential and robust biomarker candidates since they were picked out as significant features in several of the models. The chosen peaks will now be our first choice for the continuing work on protein identification and biological validation.

In a previous study, we showed that overexpression of PRAME induced apoptosis, inhibited cell proliferation and reduced tumorigenicity of leukemic cells in vivo. We also demonstrated that PRAME overexpression induced the repression of three genes (Hsp27, S100A4 and p21) associated with an unfavorable prognosis in leukemia. Here, we further investigated the mechanisms of PRAME-induced tumor suppression in vitro and in vivo. We performed a gene profiling study by analysing PRAME shRNA-silenced leukemic cells on high-density micro-arrays (Affymetrix) and found that PRAME altered the expression of two additional genes potentially involved in cancerogenesis and cancer progression: IL-8 and IGFBP-2. In a series of 28 acute myeloid leukemia pediatric patients, we observed that PRAME expression was associated with an increased leukemia-free survival. Importantly, the correlation between PRAME expression in leukemic cell lines and the decreased expression of Hsp27, S100A4, p21, IL-8 and the increased expression of IGFBP-2 was also observed in vivo, in leukemic patients. Our results suggest that the favorable prognosis of PRAME could be mediated, at least in part, by the modified expression of those genes.","['Tajeddine, Nicolas', 'Louis, Magali', 'Vermylen, Christiane', 'Gala, Jean-Luc', 'Tombal, Bertrand', 'Gailly, Philippe']","['Tajeddine N', 'Louis M', 'Vermylen C', 'Gala JL', 'Tombal B', 'Gailly P']","['Laboratory of Cell Physiology, Universite Catholique de Louvain, Brussels, Belgium.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (HSP27 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (HSPB1 protein, human)', '0 (Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Protein 2)', '0 (Interleukin-8)', '0 (Molecular Chaperones)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (PRAME protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (S100 Calcium-Binding Protein A4)', '0 (S100 Proteins)', '142662-27-9 (S100A4 protein, human)']",IM,"['Antigens, Neoplasm/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Child', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'HSP27 Heat-Shock Proteins', 'Heat-Shock Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Protein 2/genetics/*metabolism', 'Interleukin-8/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*metabolism', 'Molecular Chaperones', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Small Interfering/pharmacology', 'S100 Calcium-Binding Protein A4', 'S100 Proteins/genetics/*metabolism']",2008/05/03 09:00,2008/11/05 09:00,['2008/05/03 09:00'],"['2008/05/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/11/05 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['792731951 [pii]', '10.1080/10428190802035933 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2008 Jun;49(6):1123-31. doi: 10.1080/10428190802035933.,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, there is substantial heterogeneity of the disease within the clinical stage groups. In recent years, molecular and cellular markers have helped to predict the prognosis of CLL patients. The mutation status of the variable region of the Ig heavy chain (VH status) and genomic aberrations subdivide CLL into distinct clinical subgroups. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) can identify genomic aberrations in approximately 80% of CLL cases. Although the FISH technique is used most widely, other approaches (array-CGH, SNP-arrays or CD40 or CpG-stimulated metaphase cytogenetics) show similar results, but assess all chromosomal regions. The most frequent aberrations are deletions in 13q, 11q or 17p, and trisomy 12. Apart from providing insights into the pathogenesis, genomic aberrations identify subgroups of patients with distinct clinical pictures (lymphadenopathy (11q-) or chemotherapy resistance (17p-)). Deletions at 11q and particularly 17p are associated with rapid disease progression or inferior survival and patients with these genetic abnormalities are candidates for clinical trials investigating alternative treatments and stem cell transplantation. Similarly, abnormalities associated with good prognosis may benefit from de-escalation of current treatment approaches.","['Zenz, Thorsten', 'Mertens, Daniel', 'Dohner, Hartmut', 'Stilgenbauer, Stephan']","['Zenz T', 'Mertens D', 'Dohner H', 'Stilgenbauer S']","['Department of Internal Medicine III, University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,IM,"['Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*diagnosis', 'Molecular Diagnostic Techniques/*methods', 'Prognosis']",2008/05/03 09:00,2008/08/14 09:00,['2008/05/03 09:00'],"['2008/05/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/14 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['790629237 [pii]', '10.1080/10428190701882955 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2008 May;49(5):864-73. doi: 10.1080/10428190701882955.,5,60,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, the authors investigated the anti-proliferative and apoptotic effects of beta-aescin in human chronic myeloid leukemia K562 cell line in vitro. The anti-proliferative effects were detected by CFU-K562 colony formation and cell viability assay. The apoptotic effects were analysed by morphological analysis, annexin V assay, DNA fragmentation assay and flow cytometry DNA content analysis. The results showed that beta-aescin exhibited potent dose- and time-dependent anti-proliferative effects in K562 cells. Morphological evidence of apoptosis, a significant increase of annexin V+ and PI- cells (early apoptotic) and apoptotic DNA fragmentation, were observed in cells treated with beta-aescin. Flow cytometry analysis revealed that beta-aescin could lead to an accumulation of sub G1 population in K562 cells, and suggesting a potential G1 phase accumulation in cell cycle profile of K562 cells.

Instead, the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 would regulate one of the pathways controlling growth and/or viability. Thus, blocking both Bcr/Abl and Bcl-2 simultaneously would result in hematologic and cytogenetic improvement. Oblimersen was administered via continuous intravenous infusion over 10 days every 21 days, along with daily IM. Doses of both drugs were escalated in 3 cohorts; the initial dose of IM was 600 mg/day. Response was defined as a decrease by >30% in the percentage of t(9;22) metaphase cells. Twelve patients had primary and nine had secondary imatinib resistance. Ten patients received 4 mg/kg/day oblimersen/600 mg IM, six patients received 7 mg/kg/day oblimersen/600 mg IM and five patients received 7 mg/kg/day oblimersen/800 mg IM.

However, no systematic analysis to determine the frequency of this co-association has been reported. Analysis of 63 T-LGL patients revealed a frequent association with humoral immune system abnormalities. We identified coexisting B cell dyscrasias in 17 T-LGL patients (27% of total), of whom 12 had monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance (MGUS) (19%), and 5 had chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) (8%). The presence of both MGUS and CLL was found in 2 patients (3%) and follicular lymphoma was identified with MGUS in another T-LGL patient (2%). Additionally, polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia or hypogammaglobulinemia was found in 10 additional LGL leukemia patients bringing the total frequency of B cell abnormalities in T-LGL leukemia to 43% in our cohort. The co-association of B cell pathology with T-LGL suggests that either a common antigen drives clonal B and T cells, or that humoral malignancy could serve as the stimulus for lymphocyte expansion representing an overactive anti-tumour surveillance.","['Viny, Aaron D', 'Lichtin, Alan', 'Pohlman, Brad', 'Loughran, Thomas', 'Maciejewski, Jaroslaw']","['Viny AD', 'Lichtin A', 'Pohlman B', 'Loughran T', 'Maciejewski J']","['Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine of Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, USA.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,IM,"['Agammaglobulinemia/complications', 'B-Lymphocytes/*pathology', 'Comorbidity', 'Humans', 'Hypergammaglobulinemia/complications', 'Leukemia, Large Granular Lymphocytic/complications/*etiology/pathology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/complications', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/complications', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/*complications/pathology', 'Monoclonal Gammopathy of Undetermined Significance/complications']",2008/05/03 09:00,2008/08/14 09:00,['2008/05/03 09:00'],"['2008/05/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/14 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['791362559 [pii]', '10.1080/10428190801932635 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2008 May;49(5):932-8. doi: 10.1080/10428190801932635.,5,,,['Howard Hughes Medical Institute/United States'],,,,,,,['Leuk Lymphoma. 2008 May;49(5):845-6.

Several molecules in clinical development inhibit FLT3 with varying degrees of specificity. Preclinical models suggest that these compounds enhance the cytotoxicity of conventional chemotherapeutics against FLT3 mutant leukemia cells. The pharmacodynamic interactions between FLT3 inhibitors and chemotherapy appear to be sequence dependent. When the FLT3 inhibitor is used prior to chemotherapy, antagonism is displayed, while if FLT3 inhibition is instituted after to exposure to chemotherapy, synergistic cytotoxicity is seen. The combination of FLT3 inhibitors with chemotherapy is also complicated by potential pharmacokinetic obstacles, such as plasma protein binding and p-glycoprotein interactions. Ongoing and future studies are aimed at incorporating FLT3 inhibitors into conventional induction and consolidation therapy specifically for patients with FLT3 mutant AML.","['Pratz, Keith', 'Levis, Mark']","['Pratz K', 'Levis M']","['Division of Hematologic Malignancies, Department of Oncology, Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins, Baltimore, MD, USA.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Drug Interactions', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*antagonists & inhibitors']",2008/05/03 09:00,2008/08/14 09:00,['2008/05/03 09:00'],"['2008/05/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/14 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['790630277 [pii]', '10.1080/10428190801895352 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2008 May;49(5):852-63. doi: 10.1080/10428190801895352.,5,127,,"['R01 CA128864/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA128864-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC3031857,['NIHMS263721'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

They show unique properties (e.g. mild production conditions, lower toxicity, and environmental compatibility) compared to chemically synthesized counterparts. The numerous advantages of BS have prompted applications not only in the food, cosmetic, and pharmaceutical industries but in energy and environmental technologies as well. Mannosylerythritol lipids (MELs) are one of the most promising BS known, and are produced at yields of over 100 g/l from vegetable oils by yeast strains belonging to the genus Pseudozyma. MELs exhibit excellent surface-active and self-assembling properties leading to the formation of different lyotropic liquid crystals such as sponge (L(3)), bicontinuous cubic (V(2)) and lamella (L(alpha)) phases. They also show versatile biochemical actions, including antitumor and differentiation-inducing activities against human leukemia cells, rat pheochromocytoma cells and mouse melanoma cells.

We investigated the induction mechanism of apoptosis by costunolide in a human B cell leukemia NALM-6 cell culture system. Costunolide (10 microM)-induced apoptosis time-dependently increased, estimated by nuclear damage observation and flow cytometric analysis. Costunolide did not change Fas-associated factor 1 (FAF1), but the phosphorylation of Fas-associated death domain (FADD) at serine 194 increased from early treatment. The activation of caspase-8 and -9 and degradation of poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) was time-dependently detected by incubation with costunolide. Pretreatment of cells with caspase-3, -8 and broad spectrum caspase inhibitors significantly blocked costunolide-induced apoptosis, but caspase-9 inhibitor failed to block apoptosis. Telomerase activity was significantly suppressed after treatment with costunolide, and human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT), a critical determinant of the enzyme activity of telomerase, decreased the expression of both mRNA and protein levels by costunolide. Costunolide-induced repression of telomerase was prevented by pretreatment of cells with caspase-3, -8 and broad spectrum caspase inhibitors, but caspase-9 inhibitor was no effect. These data suggest that one of the costunolide-induced apoptotic mechanisms is that the receptor-mediated pathway precedes the mitochondria-dependent pathway, caused by the inhibition of telomerase activity via suppression of hTERT in NALM-6 cells.","['Kanno, Syu-ichi', 'Kitajima, Yasue', 'Kakuta, Mai', 'Osanai, Yuu', 'Kurauchi, Kaori', 'Ujibe, Mayuko', 'Ishikawa, Masaaki']","['Kanno S', 'Kitajima Y', 'Kakuta M', 'Osanai Y', 'Kurauchi K', 'Ujibe M', 'Ishikawa M']","['Department of Clinical Pharmacotherapeutics, Tohoku Pharmaceutical University, 4-4-1 Komatsushima, Aoba-ku, Sendai 981-8558, Japan. syu-kan@tohoku-pharm.ac.jp']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Biol Pharm Bull,Biological & pharmaceutical bulletin,9311984,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Receptors, Drug)', '0 (Sesquiterpenes)', '4IK578SA7Z (costunolide)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/physiology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Caspases/physiology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'RNA/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Receptors, Drug/drug effects/physiology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sesquiterpenes/*pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Telomerase/*antagonists & inhibitors']",2008/05/03 09:00,2008/06/20 09:00,['2008/05/03 09:00'],"['2008/05/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['JST.JSTAGE/bpb/31.1024 [pii]', '10.1248/bpb.31.1024 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Pharm Bull. 2008 May;31(5):1024-8. doi: 10.1248/bpb.31.1024.,5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODOLOGY: Ninety-six children with ALL were screened for HBV. Children were divided into three groups according to their initial HBV serology; previously vaccinated children (Group I) (n=34) previously unvaccinated and seronegative children (Group II) (n=56),and unvaccinated but HBsAg negative and anti-HBs positive children (group III) (n=6). Sixty-seven of 96 (69.7%) children received vaccination. The schedule was initiated during the third month of maintenance therapy and each course consisted of three doses given at one month interval. RESULTS: Anti-HBs seroconversion following the first course of three doses of hepatitis B vaccination in group I, II and III was 57%, 33% and 100%, respectively. It increased to 97% in Group I, 62.5% in Group II, 100% in Group III. HBsAg positivity was found in 11 children (11.5%) and all of them developed chronic hepatitis B.

We identified 6217 PV, 2838 ET, 1172 MF, and 812 MPN unclassifiable (NOS) patients diagnosed in Sweden, 43 550 controls, and first-degree relatives of cases (n = 24 577) and controls (n = 99 542). Using a marginal survival model, we calculated relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals as measures of familial aggregation. Relatives of MPN patients had significantly increased risks of PV (RR = 5.7; 3.5-9.1), ET (RR = 7.4; 3.7-14.8), and MPN NOS (RR = 7.5; 2.7-20.8). Analyses stratified by type of first-degree relative revealed consistently higher risks for siblings, compatible with a model of recessive genetic inheritance, which can be confirmed only by identifying the susceptibility gene(s). Mean age at MPN diagnosis was not different (P = .20) for affected relatives of cases (57.5 years) versus controls (60.6 years), and risk of MPN by age was not different for parents versus offspring of MPN cases (P = .10), providing no support for anticipation. Relatives of MPN patients had a borderline increased risk of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML; RR = 1.9; 0.9-3.8; P = .09). Our findings of 5- to 7-fold elevated risk of MPNs among first-degree relatives of MPN patients support the hypothesis that common, strong, shared susceptibility genes predispose to PV, ET, MF, and possibly CML.","['Landgren, Ola', 'Goldin, Lynn R', 'Kristinsson, Sigurdur Y', 'Helgadottir, Elin A', 'Samuelsson, Jan', 'Bjorkholm, Magnus']","['Landgren O', 'Goldin LR', 'Kristinsson SY', 'Helgadottir EA', 'Samuelsson J', 'Bjorkholm M']","['Genetic Epidemiology Branch, Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Department of Health & Human Services, Bethesda, MD 20892-7236, USA. landgreo@mail.nih.gov']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Case-Control Studies', '*Family Health', 'Female', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/epidemiology/etiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Polycythemia Vera/epidemiology/etiology', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/epidemiology/etiology', 'Risk', 'Survival Rate', 'Sweden/epidemiology', 'Thrombocythemia, Essential/epidemiology/etiology']",2008/05/03 09:00,2008/10/31 09:00,['2008/05/03 09:00'],"['2008/05/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/31 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)59841-8 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2008-03-143602 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2008 Sep 15;112(6):2199-204. doi: 10.1182/blood-2008-03-143602.

A phase 2 trial was conducted to determine the efficacy and safety of single-agent deforolimus in patients with relapsed or refractory hematologic malignancies. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Eligible patients were assigned to one of five disease-specific, parallel cohorts and given 12.5 mg deforolimus as a 30-minute infusion once daily for 5 days every 2 weeks. A Simon two-stage design was used for each cohort. Safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and antitumor response were assessed. RESULTS: Fifty-five patients received deforolimus as follows: cohort 1 23 acute myelogenous leukemia, two myelodysplastic syndrome and one chronic myelogenous leukemia in nonlymphoid blast phase; cohort 2, one acute lymphocytic leukemia; cohort 3, nine agnogenic myeloid metaplasia; cohort 4, eight chronic lymphocytic leukemia; cohort 5, nine mantle cell lymphoma and two T-cell leukemia/lymphoma. Most patients were heavily pretreated. Of the 52 evaluable patients, partial responses were noted in five (10%), two of seven agnogenic myeloid metaplasia and three of nine mantle cell lymphoma. Hematologic improvement/stable disease was observed in 21 (40%). Common treatment-related adverse events, which were generally mild and reversible, were mouth sores, fatigue, nausea, and thrombocytopenia. Decreased levels of phosphorylated 4E-BP1 in 9 of 11 acute myelogenous leukemia/myelodysplastic syndrome patients after therapy showed mammalian target of rapamycin inhibition by deforolimus. CONCLUSIONS: Deforolimus was well-tolerated in patients with heavily pretreated hematologic malignancies, and antitumor activity was observed. Further investigation of deforolimus alone and in combination with other therapeutic agents is warranted in patients with selected hematologic malignancies.","['Rizzieri, David A', 'Feldman, Eric', 'Dipersio, John F', 'Gabrail, Nashat', 'Stock, Wendy', 'Strair, Roger', 'Rivera, Victor M', 'Albitar, Maher', 'Bedrosian, Camille L', 'Giles, Francis J']","['Rizzieri DA', 'Feldman E', 'Dipersio JF', 'Gabrail N', 'Stock W', 'Strair R', 'Rivera VM', 'Albitar M', 'Bedrosian CL', 'Giles FJ']","['Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina 27710, USA. rizzi003@mc.duke.edu']",,['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (VEGFA protein, human)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '48Z35KB15K (ridaforolimus)', 'W36ZG6FT64 (Sirolimus)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Sirolimus/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives/antagonists & inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/*blood']",2008/05/03 09:00,2008/09/19 09:00,['2008/05/03 09:00'],"['2008/05/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/19 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['14/9/2756 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-07-1372 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2008 May 1;14(9):2756-62. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-07-1372.,9,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We previously reported the discovery of ABT-737, a potent, small-molecule Bcl-2 family protein inhibitor. A major limitation of ABT-737 is that it is not orally bioavailable, which would limit chronic single agent therapy and flexibility to dose in combination regimens. Here we report the biological properties of ABT-263, a potent, orally bioavailable Bad-like BH3 mimetic (K(i)'s of <1 nmol/L for Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Bcl-w). The oral bioavailability of ABT-263 in preclinical animal models is 20% to 50%, depending on formulation. ABT-263 disrupts Bcl-2/Bcl-xL interactions with pro-death proteins (e.g., Bim), leading to the initiation of apoptosis within 2 hours posttreatment. In human tumor cells, ABT-263 induces Bax translocation, cytochrome c release, and subsequent apoptosis. Oral administration of ABT-263 alone induces complete tumor regressions in xenograft models of small-cell lung cancer and acute lymphoblastic leukemia. In xenograft models of aggressive B-cell lymphoma and multiple myeloma where ABT-263 exhibits modest or no single agent activity, it significantly enhances the efficacy of clinically relevant therapeutic regimens. These data provide the rationale for clinical trials evaluating ABT-263 in small-cell lung cancer and B-cell malignancies. The oral efficacy of ABT-263 should provide dosing flexibility to maximize clinical utility both as a single agent and in combination regimens.","['Tse, Christin', 'Shoemaker, Alexander R', 'Adickes, Jessica', 'Anderson, Mark G', 'Chen, Jun', 'Jin, Sha', 'Johnson, Eric F', 'Marsh, Kennan C', 'Mitten, Michael J', 'Nimmer, Paul', 'Roberts, Lisa', 'Tahir, Stephen K', 'Xiao, Yu', 'Yang, Xiufen', 'Zhang, Haichao', 'Fesik, Stephen', 'Rosenberg, Saul H', 'Elmore, Steven W']","['Tse C', 'Shoemaker AR', 'Adickes J', 'Anderson MG', 'Chen J', 'Jin S', 'Johnson EF', 'Marsh KC', 'Mitten MJ', 'Nimmer P', 'Roberts L', 'Tahir SK', 'Xiao Y', 'Yang X', 'Zhang H', 'Fesik S', 'Rosenberg SH', 'Elmore SW']","['Global Pharmaceutical Research and Development, Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL 60064-6101, USA.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Aniline Compounds)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', 'XKJ5VVK2WD (navitoclax)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Aniline Compounds/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/administration & dosage', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Carcinoma, Small Cell/drug therapy/pathology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/drug therapy/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/drug therapy/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, SCID', 'Models, Biological', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/drug therapy/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Rituximab', 'Sulfonamides/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Thrombocytopenia/chemically induced', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tumor Burden', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2008/05/03 09:00,2008/06/11 09:00,['2008/05/03 09:00'],"['2008/05/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/11 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['68/9/3421 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-5836 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2008 May 1;68(9):3421-8. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-5836.,9,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Obatoclax inhibited cell growth of HL-60, U937, OCI-AML3, and KG-1 cell lines. Apoptosis induction contributed to the observed antiproliferative effects at concentrations of this agent that mirror its affinity for antiapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins. We show that obatoclax can promote the release of cytochrome c from isolated leukemia cell mitochondria and that apoptosis induced by this agent is preceded by the release of Bak from Mcl-1, liberation of Bim from both Bcl-2 and Mcl-1, and the formation of an active Bak/Bax complex. Notably, apoptosis was diminished, but not fully prevented, in the absence of Bak/Bax or Bim, suggesting that obatoclax has additional targets that contribute to its cytotoxicity. At growth inhibitory doses that did not induce apoptosis or decrease viability, obatoclax induced an S-G(2) cell-cycle block. Obatoclax induced apoptosis in AML CD34+ progenitor cells with an average IC(50) of 3.59 +/- 1.23 micromol/L although clonogenicity was inhibited at concentrations of 75 to 100 nmol/L. Obatoclax synergized with the novel BH3 mimetic ABT-737 to induce apoptosis in OCI-AML3 cells and synergistically induced apoptosis in combination with AraC in leukemic cell lines and in primary AML samples. In conclusion, we show that obatoclax potently induces apoptosis and decreases leukemia cell proliferation and may be used in a novel therapeutic strategy for AML alone and in combination with other targeted agents and chemotherapeutics.","['Konopleva, Marina', 'Watt, Julie', 'Contractor, Rooha', 'Tsao, Twee', 'Harris, David', 'Estrov, Zeev', 'Bornmann, William', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Viallet, Jean', 'Samudio, Ismael', 'Andreeff, Michael']","['Konopleva M', 'Watt J', 'Contractor R', 'Tsao T', 'Harris D', 'Estrov Z', 'Bornmann W', 'Kantarjian H', 'Viallet J', 'Samudio I', 'Andreeff M']","['Section of Molecular Hematology and Therapy, Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas M.

Here, we show the effect of epigenetic aberrations in regulating C/EBP alpha expression in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Comprehensive DNA methylation analyses of the CpG island of C/EBP alpha identified a densely methylated upstream promoter region in 51% of AML patients. Aberrant DNA methylation was strongly associated with two generally prognostically favorable cytogenetic subgroups: inv(16) and t(15;17). Surprisingly, while epigenetic treatment increased C/EBP alpha mRNA levels in vitro, C/EBP alpha protein levels decreased. Using a computational microRNA (miRNA) prediction approach and functional studies, we show that C/EBP alpha mRNA is a target for miRNA-124a. This miRNA is frequently silenced by epigenetic mechanisms in leukemia cell lines, becomes up-regulated after epigenetic treatment, and targets the C/EBP alpha 3' untranslated region. In this way, C/EBP alpha protein expression is reduced in a posttranscriptional manner. Our results indicate that epigenetic alterations of C/EBP alpha are a frequent event in AML and that epigenetic treatment can result in down-regulation of a key hematopoietic transcription factor.","['Hackanson, Bjorn', 'Bennett, Kristi L', 'Brena, Romulo M', 'Jiang, Jinmai', 'Claus, Rainer', 'Chen, Shih-Shih', 'Blagitko-Dorfs, Nadya', 'Maharry, Katie', 'Whitman, Susan P', 'Schmittgen, Thomas D', 'Lubbert, Michael', 'Marcucci, Guido', 'Bloomfield, Clara D', 'Plass, Christoph']","['Hackanson B', 'Bennett KL', 'Brena RM', 'Jiang J', 'Claus R', 'Chen SS', 'Blagitko-Dorfs N', 'Maharry K', 'Whitman SP', 'Schmittgen TD', 'Lubbert M', 'Marcucci G', 'Bloomfield CD', 'Plass C']","['Department of Molecular Virology, Immunology and Medical Genetics, Division of Human Cancer Genetics, College of Pharmacy, Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA. bjoern.hackanson@uniklinik-freiburg.de']",,['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha)', '0 (MIRN124 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha/*genetics/metabolism', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'DNA Methylation', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Hematopoiesis/genetics', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/classification/*genetics', 'MicroRNAs/physiology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'U937 Cells']",2008/05/03 09:00,2008/06/11 09:00,['2008/05/03 09:00'],"['2008/05/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/11 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['68/9/3142 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-0483 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2008 May 1;68(9):3142-51. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-0483.,9,,,"['P30CA16058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA101140/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA77658/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA101140/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA077658/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The epigenetic factors that provide this type of regulation remain ill-defined. Here we provide the first evidence that the SNF2-like ATPase Mi-2beta of the Nucleosome Remodeling Deacetylase (NuRD) complex is required for maintenance of and multilineage differentiation in the early hematopoietic hierarchy. Shortly after conditional inactivation of Mi-2beta, there is an increase in cycling and a decrease in quiescence in an HSC (hematopoietic stem cell)-enriched bone marrow population. These cycling mutant cells readily differentiate into the erythroid lineage but not into the myeloid and lymphoid lineages. Together, these effects result in an initial expansion of mutant HSC and erythroid progenitors that are later depleted as more differentiated proerythroblasts accumulate at hematopoietic sites exhibiting features of erythroid leukemia. Examination of gene expression in the mutant HSC reveals changes in the expression of genes associated with self-renewal and lineage priming and a pivotal role of Mi-2beta in their regulation. Thus, Mi-2beta provides the hematopoietic system with immune cell capabilities as well as with an extensive regenerative capacity.","['Yoshida, Toshimi', 'Hazan, Idit', 'Zhang, Jiangwen', 'Ng, Samuel Y', 'Naito, Taku', 'Snippert, Hugo J', 'Heller, Elizabeth J', 'Qi, Xiaoqing', 'Lawton, Lee N', 'Williams, Christine J', 'Georgopoulos, Katia']","['Yoshida T', 'Hazan I', 'Zhang J', 'Ng SY', 'Naito T', 'Snippert HJ', 'Heller EJ', 'Qi X', 'Lawton LN', 'Williams CJ', 'Georgopoulos K']","['Cutaneous Biology Research Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Charlestown, Massachusetts 02129, USA. toshimi.yoshida@cbrc2.mgh.harvard.edu']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Genes Dev,Genes & development,8711660,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (CD71 antigen)', '0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (Adenosine Triphosphatases)', 'EC 3.6.1.3 (Mi-2beta protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.6.4.- (DNA Helicases)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphatases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, CD34/analysis', 'Apoptosis', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics/*physiology', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromatin/*metabolism', 'DNA Helicases', 'Erythrocytes/cytology/metabolism', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry/methods', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Lymphocytes/cytology/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Myeloid Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/methods', 'Receptors, Transferrin/analysis']",2008/05/03 09:00,2008/07/01 09:00,['2008/05/03 09:00'],"['2008/05/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/01 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['22/9/1174 [pii]', '10.1101/gad.1642808 [doi]']",ppublish,Genes Dev. 2008 May 1;22(9):1174-89. doi: 10.1101/gad.1642808.,9,,,"['R01 AI042254/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL140622/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R56 AI042254/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01AI42254-12/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC2335314,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Deletion of SOCS3 causes embryonic lethality because of placental failure, and genetic reduction of LIF or the LIF receptor (LIFR) in SOCS3-deficient mice rescues placental defects and embryonic lethality; this indicates that SOCS3 is an essential inhibitor of LIFR signaling. However, the downstream signaling molecule that acts as a link between the LIFR and SOCS3 has not been identified. In this study we explored the downstream signaling of LIFR. The administration of LIF to SOCS3-heterozygous pregnant mice promotes trophoblast giant cell differentiation and accelerates placental failure in SOCS3-deficient mice. SOCS3-deficient trophoblast stem cells show enhanced and prolonged signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3) activation by LIF stimulation. Further, in the trophoblasts of SOCS3-deficient placenta and differentiating cells from the choriocarcinoma-derived cell line Rcho-1 cells, constitutive activation of Stat3 is observed. The forced expression of SOCS3, dominant-negative Stat3, and dominant-negative Janus kinase 1 (JAK1) in Rcho-1 cells significantly suppressed the trophoblast giant cell differentiation of these cells. In addition, the number of trophoblast giant cells is significantly reduced concomitant with an increased number of precursor trophoblasts in JAK1-deficient placentas. Finally, JAK1 deficiency rescues placental defects and embryonic lethality in SOCS3-deficient mice. These results indicate that the LIFR signaling is finely coordinated by JAK1, Stat3, and SOCS3 and regulates trophoblast giant cell differentiation. In addition, these data establish that LIFR-JAK1-Stat3-SOCS3 signaling is an essential pathway for the regulation of trophoblast giant cell differentiation.","['Takahashi, Yutaka', 'Takahashi, Michiko', 'Carpino, Nick', 'Jou, Shiann-Tarng', 'Chao, Jyh-Rong', 'Tanaka, Satoshi', 'Shigeyoshi, Yasufumi', 'Parganas, Evan', 'Ihle, James N']","['Takahashi Y', 'Takahashi M', 'Carpino N', 'Jou ST', 'Chao JR', 'Tanaka S', 'Shigeyoshi Y', 'Parganas E', 'Ihle JN']","['Division of Diabetes, Metabolism and Endocrinology, Department of Internal Medicine, Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine, Kobe, Japan. takahash@med.kobe-u.ac.jp']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Endocrinol,"Molecular endocrinology (Baltimore, Md.)",8801431,"['0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Socs3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 3 Protein)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Crosses, Genetic', 'Genes, Dominant', 'Giant Cells/*cytology', 'Heterozygote', 'Janus Kinase 1/*metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Rats', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 3 Protein', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins/*metabolism', 'Trophoblasts/*cytology/metabolism']",2008/05/03 09:00,2008/09/04 09:00,['2008/05/03 09:00'],"['2008/05/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/04 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['me.2008-0058 [pii]', '10.1210/me.2008-0058 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Endocrinol. 2008 Jul;22(7):1673-81. doi: 10.1210/me.2008-0058.

Traditional background subtraction methods often generate negative signals and thus cause large amounts of data loss. Hence, some researchers prefer to avoid background corrections, which typically result in the underestimation of differential expression. Here, by utilizing nonspecific negative control features integrated into Illumina whole genome expression arrays, we have developed a method of model-based background correction for BeadArrays (MBCB). We compared the MBCB with a method adapted from the Affymetrix robust multi-array analysis algorithm and with no background subtraction, using a mouse acute myeloid leukemia (AML) dataset. We demonstrated that differential expression ratios obtained by using the MBCB had the best correlation with quantitative RT-PCR. MBCB also achieved better sensitivity in detecting differentially expressed genes with biological significance. For example, we demonstrated that the differential regulation of Tnfr2, Ikk and NF-kappaB, the death receptor pathway, in the AML samples, could only be detected by using data after MBCB implementation. We conclude that MBCB is a robust background correction method that will lead to more precise determination of gene expression and better biological interpretation of Illumina BeadArray data.","['Ding, Liang-Hao', 'Xie, Yang', 'Park, Seongmi', 'Xiao, Guanghua', 'Story, Michael D']","['Ding LH', 'Xie Y', 'Park S', 'Xiao G', 'Story MD']","['Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center Genomics Core Facility, Department of Radiation Oncology, Division of Molecular Radiation Biology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas, Dallas, TX, USA.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", 'Validation Study']",England,Nucleic Acids Res,Nucleic acids research,0411011,,IM,"['Animals', 'Gene Expression Profiling/*methods/standards', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred CBA', '*Models, Statistical', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/*methods/standards', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction/genetics']",2008/05/03 09:00,2008/06/25 09:00,['2008/05/03 09:00'],"['2008/05/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/25 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['gkn234 [pii]', '10.1093/nar/gkn234 [doi]']",ppublish,Nucleic Acids Res. 2008 Jun;36(10):e58. doi: 10.1093/nar/gkn234.

Their movement and positional diversity occasionally result in phenotypic changes and variation by causing altered expression or disruption of neighboring host genes. Here, we describe a novel microarray-based method by which dispersed genomic locations of a type of retrotransposon in a mammalian genome can be identified. Using this method, we mapped the DNA elements for a mouse retrotransposon, intracisternal A-particle (IAP), within genomes of C3H/He and C57BL/6J inbred mouse strains; consequently we detected hundreds of probable IAP cDNA-integrated genomic regions, in which a considerable number of strain-specific putative insertions were included. In addition, by comparing genomic DNAs from radiation-induced myeloid leukemia cells and its reference normal tissue, we detected three genomic regions around which an IAP element was integrated.

However, little is known about the role of microRNAs in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). METHODS: Using microRNA expression profiling, we studied samples of leukemia cells from adults under the age of 60 years who had cytogenetically normal AML and high-risk molecular features--that is, an internal tandem duplication in the fms-related tyrosine kinase 3 gene (FLT3-ITD), a wild-type nucleophosmin (NPM1), or both. A microRNA signature that was associated with event-free survival was derived from a training group of 64 patients and tested in a validation group of 55 patients. For the latter, a microRNA compound covariate predictor (called a microRNA summary value) was computed on the basis of weighted levels of the microRNAs forming the outcome signature. RESULTS: Of 305 microRNA probes, 12 (including 5 representing microRNA-181 family members) were associated with event-free survival in the training group (P<0.005). In the validation group, the microRNA summary value was inversely associated with event-free survival (P=0.03). In multivariable analysis, the microRNA summary value remained associated with event-free survival (P=0.04) after adjustment for the allelic ratio of FLT3-ITD to wild-type FLT3 and for the white-cell count. Using results of gene-expression microarray analysis, we found that expression levels of the microRNA-181 family were inversely correlated with expression levels of predicted target genes encoding proteins involved in pathways of innate immunity mediated by toll-like receptors and interleukin-1beta. CONCLUSIONS: A microRNA signature in molecularly defined, high-risk, cytogenetically normal AML is associated with the clinical outcome and with target genes encoding proteins involved in specific innate-immunity pathways.","['Marcucci, Guido', 'Radmacher, Michael D', 'Maharry, Kati', 'Mrozek, Krzysztof', 'Ruppert, Amy S', 'Paschka, Peter', 'Vukosavljevic, Tamara', 'Whitman, Susan P', 'Baldus, Claudia D', 'Langer, Christian', 'Liu, Chang-Gong', 'Carroll, Andrew J', 'Powell, Bayard L', 'Garzon, Ramiro', 'Croce, Carlo M', 'Kolitz, Jonathan E', 'Caligiuri, Michael A', 'Larson, Richard A', 'Bloomfield, Clara D']","['Marcucci G', 'Radmacher MD', 'Maharry K', 'Mrozek K', 'Ruppert AS', 'Paschka P', 'Vukosavljevic T', 'Whitman SP', 'Baldus CD', 'Langer C', 'Liu CG', 'Carroll AJ', 'Powell BL', 'Garzon R', 'Croce CM', 'Kolitz JE', 'Caligiuri MA', 'Larson RA', 'Bloomfield CD']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, Comprehensive Cancer Center, Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA. guido.marcucci@osumc.edu']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,N Engl J Med,The New England journal of medicine,0255562,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (ERG protein, human)', '0 (Genetic Markers)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (RNA Probes)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcriptional Regulator ERG)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Analysis of Variance', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Female', '*Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/genetics', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'MicroRNAs/*metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'RNA Probes', 'RNA, Neoplasm/*metabolism', 'Trans-Activators/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcriptional Regulator ERG', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics']",2008/05/03 09:00,2008/05/10 09:00,['2008/05/03 09:00'],"['2008/05/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/10 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['358/18/1919 [pii]', '10.1056/NEJMoa074256 [doi]']",ppublish,N Engl J Med. 2008 May 1;358(18):1919-28. doi: 10.1056/NEJMoa074256.,18,,,"['CA33601/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA03927/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA35279/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA101140/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UG1 CA189850/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA77658/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA114725/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA16058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA102031/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA101140/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA077658/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA41287/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA035279/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA31946/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA003927/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,['Copyright 2008 Massachusetts Medical Society.'],,,"['N Engl J Med. 2008 May 1;358(18):1960-2.

Patients had been entered into one of four trials of therapy for AML. In each study, patients with an HLA-matched related donor were assigned to undergo stem-cell transplantation. RESULTS: A total of 53% of patients had NPM1 mutations, 31% had FLT3 internal tandem duplications (ITDs), 11% had FLT3 tyrosine kinase-domain mutations, 13% had CEBPA mutations, 7% had MLL partial tandem duplications (PTDs), and 13% had NRAS mutations. The overall complete-remission rate was 77%. The genotype of mutant NPM1 without FLT3-ITD, the mutant CEBPA genotype, and younger age were each significantly associated with complete remission. Of the 663 patients who received postremission therapy, 150 underwent hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation from an HLA-matched related donor. Significant associations were found between the risk of relapse or the risk of death during complete remission and the leukemia genotype of mutant NPM1 without FLT3-ITD (hazard ratio, 0.44; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.32 to 0.61), the mutant CEBPA genotype (hazard ratio, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.30 to 0.75), and the MLL-PTD genotype (hazard ratio, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.00 to 2.43), as well as receipt of a transplant from an HLA-matched related donor (hazard ratio, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.44 to 0.82). The benefit of the transplant was limited to the subgroup of patients with the prognostically adverse genotype FLT3-ITD or the genotype consisting of wild-type NPM1 and CEBPA without FLT3-ITD. CONCLUSIONS: Genotypes defined by the mutational status of NPM1, FLT3, CEBPA, and MLL are associated with the outcome of treatment for patients with cytogenetically normal AML.","['Schlenk, Richard F', 'Dohner, Konstanze', 'Krauter, Jurgen', 'Frohling, Stefan', 'Corbacioglu, Andrea', 'Bullinger, Lars', 'Habdank, Marianne', 'Spath, Daniela', 'Morgan, Michael', 'Benner, Axel', 'Schlegelberger, Brigitte', 'Heil, Gerhard', 'Ganser, Arnold', 'Dohner, Hartmut']","['Schlenk RF', 'Dohner K', 'Krauter J', 'Frohling S', 'Corbacioglu A', 'Bullinger L', 'Habdank M', 'Spath D', 'Morgan M', 'Benner A', 'Schlegelberger B', 'Heil G', 'Ganser A', 'Dohner H']","['University Hospital of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.']",['German-Austrian Acute Myeloid Leukemia Study Group'],['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,N Engl J Med,The New England journal of medicine,0255562,"['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha)', '0 (Genetic Markers)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Viral)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha/genetics', 'Female', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/mortality/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Oncogene Proteins, Viral/genetics', 'Remission Induction', '*Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Treatment Outcome', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics']",2008/05/03 09:00,2008/05/10 09:00,['2008/05/03 09:00'],"['2008/05/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/10 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['358/18/1909 [pii]', '10.1056/NEJMoa074306 [doi]']",ppublish,N Engl J Med. 2008 May 1;358(18):1909-18. doi: 10.1056/NEJMoa074306.,18,,,,,,,['Copyright 2008 Massachusetts Medical Society.'],,,"['N Engl J Med. 2008 May 1;358(18):1960-2.

Here we describe the generation and long-term expansion of multiple human foetal neural stem (NS) cell lines in monolayer culture without genetic immortalization. Adherent human NS cells are propagated in the presence of epidermal growth factor (EGF) and fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2), under which conditions they stably express neural precursor markers and exhibit negligible differentiation into neurons or glia. However, they produce astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and neurons upon exposure to appropriate differentiation factors. Single cell cloning demonstrates that human NS cells are tripotent. They retain a diploid karyotype and constant neurogenic capacity after over 100 generations. In contrast to human neurospheres, we observe no requirement for the cytokine leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) for continued expansion of adherent human NS cells. Human NS cells can be stably transfected to provide reporter lines and readily imaged in live monolayer cultures, creating the potential for high content genetic and chemical screens.","['Sun, Yirui', 'Pollard, Steven', 'Conti, Luciano', 'Toselli, Mauro', 'Biella, Gerardo', 'Parkin, Georgina', 'Willatt, Lionel', 'Falk, Anna', 'Cattaneo, Elena', 'Smith, Austin']","['Sun Y', 'Pollard S', 'Conti L', 'Toselli M', 'Biella G', 'Parkin G', 'Willatt L', 'Falk A', 'Cattaneo E', 'Smith A']","['Wellcome Trust Centre for Stem Cell Research and Department of Biochemistry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Mol Cell Neurosci,Molecular and cellular neurosciences,9100095,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule L1)', '0 (Sialic Acids)', '0 (polysialyl neural cell adhesion molecule)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)']",IM,"['Astrocytes/*cytology', 'Biomarkers/metabolism', 'Cell Culture Techniques/*methods', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Cell Division/physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Clone Cells', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/*cytology/metabolism', 'Fetus/cytology', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/genetics', 'Humans', 'Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule L1/metabolism', 'Neurons/*cytology', 'Oligodendroglia/*cytology', 'Sialic Acids/metabolism', 'Transfection']",2008/05/03 09:00,2008/09/10 09:00,['2008/05/03 09:00'],"['2007/11/12 00:00 [received]', '2008/02/15 00:00 [revised]', '2008/02/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/05/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/10 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1044-7431(08)00068-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.mcn.2008.02.014 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Neurosci. 2008 Jun;38(2):245-58. doi: 10.1016/j.mcn.2008.02.014.

Scoring matrices, hidden Markov models, and artificial neural networks are examples of algorithms that have been successful in MHC-peptide-binding prediction. Because these algorithms are based on a limited amount of experimental peptide-binding data, prediction is only possible for a small fraction of the thousands of known MHC proteins. In the primary field of application for such algorithms--vaccine design--the ability to make predictions for the most frequent MHC alleles may be sufficient. However, emerging applications of leukemia-specific T cells require a patient-specific MHC-peptide-binding prediction. The modular model of MHC presented here is an attempt to maximize the number of predictable MHC alleles, based on a limited pool of experimentally determined peptide-binding data.","['DeLuca, David S', 'Blasczyk, Rainer']","['DeLuca DS', 'Blasczyk R']","['Institute for Transfusion Medicine, Hannover Medical School, Germany.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Methods Mol Biol,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",9214969,"['0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (Peptides)']",IM,"['Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Computational Biology', 'Databases, Protein', 'HLA Antigens/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunogenetics', '*Major Histocompatibility Complex', 'Peptides/chemistry/immunology/metabolism', 'Protein Binding']",2008/05/03 09:00,2008/06/06 09:00,['2008/05/03 09:00'],"['2008/05/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/06 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/03 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/978-1-60327-118-9_18 [doi]'],ppublish,Methods Mol Biol. 2007;409:261-71. doi: 10.1007/978-1-60327-118-9_18.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Advantages and disadvantages of the CVAD from the patient's perspective should also be important parts in the selection of type of device. Perceptions on having a CVAD were thus analysed in a series of adult patients with AL included in a prospective randomised study evaluating the use of a double lumen totally implantable subcutaneous port system (PORT) or a double lumen central venous catheter (CVC) regarding survival time and complication rate. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Perceptions were registered in 32 patients (median age 68 years, range 24-83 years) on three occasions (T1; the day after placement, T2; 3 weeks after placement and T3 after 12 weeks and/or when the CVAD was removed) with the use of two study specific questionnaires. MAIN RESULTS: Overall, many patients reported minor catheter related discomfort, feelings of anxiety and restrictions. Half of the patients (6/11) who experienced a local bleeding after CVAD insertion described the placement procedure as unpleasant. More patients in the CVC group compared with the PORT group stated that they thought of having a CVAD (T3; p = 0.02) and that the CVAD interfered when dressing themselves (T2; p = 0.02 and T3; 0.04) or taking a shower (T3; p = 0.009).

Furthermore, mature mouse B cells could be reprogrammed into macrophages by overexpression of myeloid-specific transcription factors. Here, we report that aberrant activity of the transmembrane receptor, Notch1, interferes with the B-lymphoid phenotype of mature human germinal center-derived B cells in Hodgkin lymphoma, so called Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg cells. They have lost the B-cell phenotype despite their mature B-cell origin. Notch1 remodels the B-cell transcription factor network by antagonizing the key transcription factors E2A and early B-cell factor (EBF). Through this mechanism, B lineage-specific genes were suppressed and B lineage-inappropriate genes were induced. We provide evidence that absence of the Notch inhibitor Deltex1 contributes to deregulated Notch activity in Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg cells. These data suggest that Notch activation interferes with dedifferentiation of neoplastic B cells in Hodgkin lymphoma.","['Jundt, F', 'Acikgoz, O', 'Kwon, S-H', 'Schwarzer, R', 'Anagnostopoulos, I', 'Wiesner, B', 'Mathas, S', 'Hummel, M', 'Stein, H', 'Reichardt, H M', 'Dorken, B']","['Jundt F', 'Acikgoz O', 'Kwon SH', 'Schwarzer R', 'Anagnostopoulos I', 'Wiesner B', 'Mathas S', 'Hummel M', 'Stein H', 'Reichardt HM', 'Dorken B']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Charite, Campus Virchow-Klinikum, University Medicine Berlin, Berlin, Germany. fjundt@mdc-berlin.de']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (PAX5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (PAX5 protein, human)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/cytology/*immunology', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Lineage', 'DNA Primers', 'Hodgkin Disease/immunology/metabolism/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'PAX5 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Phenotype', 'Receptor, Notch1/*metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2008/05/02 09:00,2008/09/13 09:00,['2008/05/02 09:00'],"['2008/05/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/13 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/02 09:00 [entrez]']","['leu2008101 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2008.101 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2008 Aug;22(8):1587-94. doi: 10.1038/leu.2008.101.

Inhibition of telomerase therefore holds great promise as anticancer therapy. We have synthesized a novel telomerase inhibitor GRN163L, a lipid-attached phosphoramidate oligonucleotide complementary to template region of the RNA subunit of telomerase. Here, we report that GRN163L is efficiently taken up by human myeloma cells without any need of transfection and is resistant to nucleolytic degradation. The exposure of myeloma cells to GRN163L led to an effective inhibition of telomerase activity, reduction of telomere length and apoptotic cell death after a lag period of 2-3 weeks. Mismatch control oligonucleotides had no effect on growth of myeloma cells. The in vivo efficacy of GRN163L was confirmed in two murine models of human multiple myeloma. In three independent experiments, significant reduction in tumor cell growth and better survival than control mice was observed. Furthermore, GRN163L-induced myeloma cell death could be significantly enhanced by Hsp90 inhibitor 17AAG. These data provide the preclinical rationale for clinical evaluation of GRN163L in myeloma and in combination with 17AAG.","['Shammas, M A', 'Koley, H', 'Bertheau, R C', 'Neri, P', 'Fulciniti, M', 'Tassone, P', 'Blotta, S', 'Protopopov, A', 'Mitsiades, C', 'Batchu, R B', 'Anderson, K C', 'Chin, A', 'Gryaznov, S', 'Munshi, N C']","['Shammas MA', 'Koley H', 'Bertheau RC', 'Neri P', 'Fulciniti M', 'Tassone P', 'Blotta S', 'Protopopov A', 'Mitsiades C', 'Batchu RB', 'Anderson KC', 'Chin A', 'Gryaznov S', 'Munshi NC']","['Department of Medicine, VA Boston Healthcare System, MA, USA.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Benzoquinones)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (GRN163L peptide)', '0 (HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Lactams, Macrocyclic)', '0 (Oligonucleotides)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '4GY0AVT3L4 (tanespimycin)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzoquinones/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Lactams, Macrocyclic/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Multiple Myeloma/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Oligonucleotides', 'Oligopeptides/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Telomerase/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Telomere']",2008/05/02 09:00,2008/08/30 09:00,['2008/05/02 09:00'],"['2008/05/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/30 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/02 09:00 [entrez]']","['leu200881 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2008.81 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2008 Jul;22(7):1410-8. doi: 10.1038/leu.2008.81.

The aim of the study was to investigate the protective effect of longer breastfeeding on the risk of lymphoid malignancies in children and its dependent socio-economic factors. METHODS: The study group comprised of 169 patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), Hodgkin's (HL) and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), age =or<15 years, and 169 healthy controls, matched to patients by age and sex. Mothers of all study subjects provided information via telephone about the history of breastfeeding and parameters seen as proxies for viral infection. RESULTS: The mean age+/-SD of cases was 5.44+/- 3.29 years and of control subjects 5.51+/-3.62 years. The male/female ratio was 1.73. Overall, the mean number of months of breastfeeding in the male patients and controls was 9.1 (95% confidence interval [CI] 7.9-10.4) and 12.1 (95% CI 11.0-13.4), respectively (P<0.001), and in the female patients and controls 8.4 (95% CI 6.9-10.1) and 11.5 (95% CI 10.0-13.0), respectively (P<0.01). In 103 ALL patients, a shorter period of breastfeeding (0-6 months duration), was associated with increased odds ratio (OR) for males (OR=3.1, 95% CI 1.4-6.8) and females (OR=2.2, 95% CI 0.8-6.32) as compared to breastfeeding longer than 6 months. In 103 ALL patients, 32 HL and 34 NHL patients, there were no statistically significant differences in the duration of breastfeeding between the male and female patients and their respective controls. In multivariate analysis, statistically significant risk factors for the development of childhood lymphoid malignancy were: a shorter duration of breastfeeding, lower age and level of education of mother and higher income, larger size of accommodation and birth order in the family. CONCLUSION: The current study confirmed that a longer duration of breastfeeding has protective effect against ALL and HL. Additional factors found to be associated with an elevated risk of lymphoid malignancy were low age and low education of mother. All these factors can be related to an increased risk of early childhood infections.","['Bener, A', 'Hoffmann, G F', 'Afify, Z', 'Rasul, K', 'Tewfik, I']","['Bener A', 'Hoffmann GF', 'Afify Z', 'Rasul K', 'Tewfik I']","['Department of Medical Statistics and Epidemiology, Hamad General Hospital and Hamad Medical Corporation Doha, State of Qatar. abener@hmc.org.qa']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],Italy,Minerva Pediatr,Minerva pediatrica,0400740,,IM,"['Adolescent', '*Breast Feeding', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Female', 'Hodgkin Disease/*prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*prevention & control', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*prevention & control', 'Qatar', 'Risk Factors', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Time Factors']",2008/05/02 09:00,2008/08/23 09:00,['2008/05/02 09:00'],"['2008/05/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/23 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/02 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Minerva Pediatr. 2008 Apr;60(2):155-61.,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One of the main targets of aldosterone is the epithelial Na channel (ENaC) located in the apical membrane of target cells. Previous studies identified several genes involved in the regulation of ENaC such as SGK1; however, SGK1 knockout mice have only a mild salt-losing phenotype, indicating that further genes must be involved in the action of aldosterone. In our search for further aldosterone-regulated genes, we discovered that aldosterone, at physiological concentrations, induces the expression of the promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger protein (PLZF) in renal cortical collecting duct (CCD) cell lines that stably express mineralocorticoid receptors (MRs). This effect is rapid and does not require de novo protein synthesis, suggesting a direct action. Surprisingly, stable overexpression of human or mouse PLZF isoforms significantly decreased transepithelial Na transport in CCD cells while having no effect on the integrity of the monolayers. In parallel with the decline in Na transport, PLZF suppressed the mRNA levels of beta- and gamma-ENaC subunits. These observations suggest that PLZF is a negative regulator of ENaC in renal epithelial cells and might be part of a negative feedback loop that limits aldosterone's stimulatory effects on sodium reabsorption.","['Naray-Fejes-Toth, Aniko', 'Boyd, Cary', 'Fejes-Toth, Geza']","['Naray-Fejes-Toth A', 'Boyd C', 'Fejes-Toth G']","['Department of Physiology, Dartmouth Medical School, Lebanon, NH 03756-0001, USA. aniko.fejes-toth@dartmouth.edu']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Am J Physiol Renal Physiol,American journal of physiology.

The development of the Bcr-Abl-targeted imatinib represents a paradigm shift in the treatment of CML, because treatment with imatinib resulted in significantly better patient outcome, response rates, and overall survival compared with previous standards. Despite this advance, not all patients benefit from imatinib because of resistance and intolerance. Resistance to imatinib can develop from a number of mechanisms that can be defined as Bcr-Abl-dependent (e.g., most commonly resulting from point mutations in the Abl kinase domain) and Bcr-Abl-independent mechanisms (including the constitutive activation of downstream signaling molecules, e.g., Src family kinases), which could result in the activation of the pathway regardless of Bcr-Abl inhibition. Clearly, new treatment approaches are required for patients resistant to or intolerant of imatinib, which can be dose escalated in patients who demonstrate resistance. This does not result in long-term responses. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is limited by the availability of matched donors and the potential for morbidity. Dasatinib, a dual Bcr-Abl/Src kinase inhibitor, has shown efficacy against all imatinib-resistant Bcr-Abl mutations except for T315I. A large trial program showed that dasatinib is effective in patients previously exposed to imatinib and has a manageable safety profile in all phases of CML and Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia, resulting in its approval.

One antiviral mechanism involves deaminating dC residues in minus-strand DNA during reverse transcription, resulting in G-to-A mutations in the coding strand. We investigated the effects of mouse APOBEC3 (mA3) and human APOBEC3G (hA3G) upon Moloney murine leukemia virus (MLV). We find that mA3 inactivates MLV but is significantly less effective against MLV than is hA3G. In contrast, mA3 is as potent against human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1, lacking the protective Vif protein) as is hA3G. The two APOBEC3 proteins are packaged to similar extents in MLV particles. Dose-response profiles imply that a single APOBEC3 molecule (or oligomer) is sufficient to inactivate an MLV particle. The inactivation of MLV by mA3 and hA3G is accompanied by relatively small reductions in the amount of viral DNA in infected cells. Although hA3G induces significant levels of G-to-A mutations in both MLV and HIV DNAs, and mA3 induces these mutations in HIV DNA, no such mutations were detected in DNA synthesized by MLV inactivated by mA3. Thus, MLV has apparently evolved to partially resist the antiviral effects of mA3 and to totally resist the ability of mA3 to induce G-to-A mutation in viral DNA. Unlike the resistance of HIV-1 and human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 to hA3G, the resistance of MLV to mA3 is not mediated by the exclusion of APOBEC from the virus particle. The nature of its resistance and the mechanism of inactivation of MLV by mA3 are completely unknown.","['Rulli, Samuel J Jr', 'Mirro, Jane', 'Hill, Shawn A', 'Lloyd, Patricia', 'Gorelick, Robert J', 'Coffin, John M', 'Derse, David', 'Rein, Alan']","['Rulli SJ Jr', 'Mirro J', 'Hill SA', 'Lloyd P', 'Gorelick RJ', 'Coffin JM', 'Derse D', 'Rein A']","['HIV Drug Resistance Program, National Cancer Institute-Frederick, Frederick, MD 12702-1201, USA.']",,['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', 'EC 3.5.4.1 (Cytosine Deaminase)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (APOBEC Deaminases)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (APOBEC3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (Apobec3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (Cytidine Deaminase)']",IM,"['APOBEC Deaminases', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Cytidine Deaminase/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cytosine Deaminase/genetics/*metabolism', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'DNA, Viral/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', '*Virus Inactivation']",2008/05/02 09:00,2008/08/07 09:00,['2008/05/02 09:00'],"['2008/05/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/07 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/02 09:00 [entrez]']","['JVI.01357-07 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.01357-07 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2008 Jul;82(13):6566-75. doi: 10.1128/JVI.01357-07.

The Gag proteins of Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) contain a short spacer peptide (SP or SP1, respectively) separating the capsid (CA) and nucleocapsid (NC) domains. SP or SP1 and the residues immediately upstream are known to be critical for proper assembly. Using mutagenesis and electron microscopy analysis of insect cells or chicken cells overexpressing RSV Gag, we defined the SP assembly domain to include the last 8 residues of CA, all 12 residues of SP, and the first 4 residues of NC. Five- or two-amino acid glycine-rich insertions or substitutions in this critical region uniformly resulted in the budding of abnormal, long tubular particles. The equivalent SP1-containing HIV-1 Gag sequence was unable to functionally replace the RSV sequence in supporting normal RSV spherical assembly. According to secondary structure predictions, RSV and HIV-1 SP/SP1 and adjoining residues may form an alpha helix, and what is likely the functionally equivalent sequence in murine leukemia virus Gag has been inferred by mutational analysis to form an amphipathic alpha helix. However, our alanine insertion mutagenesis did not provide evidence for an amphipathic helix in RSV Gag. Taken together, these results define a short assembly domain between the folded portions of CA and NC, which is essential for formation of the immature Gag shell.","['Keller, Paul W', 'Johnson, Marc C', 'Vogt, Volker M']","['Keller PW', 'Johnson MC', 'Vogt VM']","['Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Biotechnology Bldg., Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853, USA.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (gag protein p19, Rous sarcoma virus)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amino Acid Substitution/genetics', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Chickens', 'Gene Products, gag/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism', 'Genetic Complementation Test', 'HIV-1/genetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics', 'Microscopy, Electron, Scanning', 'Microscopy, Electron, Transmission', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis, Insertional', '*Mutation', 'Protein Structure, Secondary', 'Recombination, Genetic', 'Rous sarcoma virus/genetics/*physiology/ultrastructure', 'Spodoptera', 'Virion/ultrastructure', 'Virus Assembly/genetics/*physiology']",2008/05/02 09:00,2008/07/17 09:00,['2008/05/02 09:00'],"['2008/05/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/02 09:00 [entrez]']","['JVI.00213-08 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.00213-08 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2008 Jul;82(14):6788-97. doi: 10.1128/JVI.00213-08.

Lyophilised Tricat vaccine was dissolved in the liquid FeLV vaccine and no detectable deleterious effect on the titre of any of the live virus components was observed after 2h incubation. In vivo studies where the vaccines were mixed in the same syringe prior to inoculation showed no alteration to the safety profile assessed by repeat and overdose studies. Serological comparisons of the modified live viral antibody titres showed no evidence of reduced responses following administration of the mixed products.

However, before being incorporated into daily practice these markers require standardization and validation in prospective trials. Meanwhile, prognosis of patients with CLL should remain to be based on clinical stages and other easily obtainable clinical parameters. An important area of research is the identification of markers useful for predicting response to therapy. Among them, 17p- reflecting p53 abnormalities is particularly important. Also relevant is 11q- pointing out to ATM defects. The correlation of IgVH mutations, ZAP-70 and CD38 expression with response is unclear and needs further investigation.

ES cell-derived spheres of any passage acquired increased competence to differentiate into neurons over time in culture. Eight-day-old spheres produced many neurons upon plating in differentiation conditions whereas 3-day-old spheres produce none, even after monolayer expansion or treatment with blockers of inhibitory signals, indicating the acquisition of a reversible, proto-neurogenic state during sphere development. Gene expression profiling with oligonucleotide microarrays was used to identify the transcriptional changes accompanying this process. Sphere growth was characterized by down-regulation of a subset of ES cell-expressed genes during the first few days of sphere formation, and progressive up-regulation of novel genes over the course of 1 week in culture. Differential gene expression between 3-day-old and 8 day-old spheres was verified by quantitative real-time PCR experiments. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) of microarray data indicated that neurogenic potential in the late stages of sphere development correlated predominantly with up-regulation of pathways related to mitochondrial function, cell metabolism, oxidative stress, hypoxia, and down-regulation of RNA transcription and proteasome machineries, as well as pathways induced by myc and repressed by retinoic acid. We propose that differences in cellular metabolic state brought about by cell-cell contact and paracrine interactions in the sphere niche may play crucial roles in biasing the early stages of ES cell differentiation toward a neuronal phenotype.","['Moliner, Annalena', 'Enfors, Patrik', 'Ibanez, Carlos F', 'Andang, Michael']","['Moliner A', 'Enfors P', 'Ibanez CF', 'Andang M']","['Department of Neuroscience, Karolinska Institute, 17177 Stockholm, Sweden.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Stem Cells Dev,Stem cells and development,101197107,,IM,"['Algorithms', 'Animals', '*Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Data Interpretation, Statistical', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/metabolism/*physiology', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Mice', 'Neurons/metabolism/*physiology', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Research Design', 'Spheroids, Cellular/metabolism/*physiology']",2008/05/02 09:00,2008/08/01 09:00,['2008/05/02 09:00'],"['2008/05/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/01 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/02 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/scd.2007.0211 [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cells Dev. 2008 Apr;17(2):233-43. doi: 10.1089/scd.2007.0211.,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A microfluidic chip that was capable of selecting and retaining a single multidrug-resistant cancer cell was used to investigate drug efflux inhibition in leukemia cell lines. Three advantages of the microfluidic-based same-single-cell analysis (dubbed as SASCA) method have been revealed. First, it readily detects the modulation of drug efflux of anticancer compounds (e.g., daunorubicin) by MDR modulators (e.g., verapamil) among cellular variations. Second, SASCA is able to compare the different cellular abilities in response to drug efflux modulation based on the drug transport kinetics of single cells. Third, SASCA requires only a small number of cells, which may be beneficial for investigating drug resistance in minor cell subpopulations (e.g., cancer ""stem"" cells).","['Li, XiuJun', 'Ling, Victor', 'Li, Paul C H']","['Li X', 'Ling V', 'Li PC']","['Department of Chemistry, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, BC, V5A 1S6, Canada.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Anal Chem,Analytical chemistry,0370536,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Artemisinins)', '0 (Chalcones)', '0 (Sesquiterpenes)', '60W3249T9M (Artesunate)', 'B9CTI9GB8F (isoliquiritigenin)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Artemisinins/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Artesunate', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cells/*metabolism', 'Chalcones/metabolism/pharmacology', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Medicine, Chinese Traditional', 'Microfluidic Analytical Techniques/*methods', 'Sesquiterpenes/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Verapamil/metabolism']",2008/05/02 09:00,2008/07/19 09:00,['2008/05/02 09:00'],"['2008/05/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/19 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/02 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/ac800231k [doi]'],ppublish,Anal Chem. 2008 Jun 1;80(11):4095-102. doi: 10.1021/ac800231k.

To identify CpG islands methylated in prostate cancer, we used methylated CpG island amplification (MCA) coupled with representational difference analysis (RDA) on prostate cancer cell lines. We isolated 34 clones that corresponded to promoter CpG islands, including 5 reported targets of hypermethylation in cancer. We confirmed the data for 17 CpG islands by COBRA and/or pyrosequencing. All 17 genes were methylated in at least 2 cell lines of a 21-cancer cell line panel containing prostate cancer, colon cancer, leukemia, and breast cancer. Based on methylation in primary tumors compared to normal adjacent tissues, NKX2-5, CLSTN1, SPOCK2, SLC16A12, DPYS and NSE1 are candidate biomarkers for prostate cancer (methylation range 50%-85%). The combination of NSE1 or SPOCK2 hypermethylation showed a sensitivity of 80% and specificity of 95% in differentiating cancer from normal. Similarly NKX2-5, SPOCK2, SLC16A12, DPYS and GALR2 are candidate biomarkers for colon cancer (methylation range 60%-95%) and GALR2 hypermethylation showed a sensitivity of 85% and specificity of 95%. Finally, SLC16A12, GALR2, TOX, SPOCK2, EGFR5 and DPYS are candidate biomarkers for breast cancer (methylation range 33%-79%) with the combination of EGFR5 or TOX hypermethylation showing a sensitivity of 92% and specificity of 92%. Expression analysis for eight genes that had the most hypermethylation confirmed the methylation associated silencing and reactivation with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine treatment.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: TEL gene status was determined for 926 patients with B-precursor ALL enrolled on the Pediatric Oncology Group ALinC 16 trials and patients were observed for a median time of 8 years. RESULTS: Rearrangements of the TEL gene were detected in 244 patients (26%). The estimated 5-year event-free survival rate (+/- SE) for patients with TEL rearrangements was 86% +/- 2%, compared with 72% +/- 2% for those with germline TEL (P < .0001). TEL rearrangements were associated with a superior outcome among patients with standard-risk ALL, high-risk ALL, and rapid early responses to therapy. In a multivariate analysis that included risk group, sex, and day 15 marrow status, TEL status was an independent predictor of outcome (P = .0002). CONCLUSION: We conclude that TEL gene status should be incorporated into risk classification schemes and suggest that patients who have standard-risk features, the TEL-AML1 fusion, and rapid early responses to therapy, should be treated with antimetabolite-based therapy designed to maintain their high cure rates and avoid late effects.","['Rubnitz, Jeffrey E', 'Wichlan, David', 'Devidas, Meenakshi', 'Shuster, Jonathan', 'Linda, Stephen B', 'Kurtzberg, Joanne', 'Bell, Beverly', 'Hunger, Stephen P', 'Chauvenet, Allen', 'Pui, Ching-Hon', 'Camitta, Bruce', 'Pullen, Jeanette']","['Rubnitz JE', 'Wichlan D', 'Devidas M', 'Shuster J', 'Linda SB', 'Kurtzberg J', 'Bell B', 'Hunger SP', 'Chauvenet A', 'Pui CH', 'Camitta B', 'Pullen J']","[""Department of Oncology, Mail Stop 260, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, 332 N Lauderdale St, Memphis, TN 38105-2794, USA. jeffrey.rubnitz@stjude.org""]","[""Children's Oncology Group""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (TEL-AML1 fusion protein)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*genetics', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', '*Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Male', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/mortality/pathology/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Prospective Studies', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sex Factors', 'Survival Rate', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'United States']",2008/05/01 09:00,2008/05/21 09:00,['2008/05/01 09:00'],"['2008/05/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/21 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['26/13/2186 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2007.14.3552 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2008 May 1;26(13):2186-91. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2007.14.3552.,13,,,"['CA 98543/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA-21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA021765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA098543/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA098413/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 30969/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA-73983/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA029139/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC4485397,['NIHMS698549'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

These observations suggest that a greater understanding of the interaction of stromal cells with leukemic cells is essential. Here, we present an in vivo system for monitoring relative tumor accumulation in leukemic mice and residual disease in leukemic mice treated with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor and an in vitro system for identifying integral factors involved in stromal-mediated cytoprotection. Using the in vivo model, we observed high tumor burden/residual disease in tissues characterized as significant sources of hematopoiesis-promoting stroma, with bone marrow stroma most frequently showing the highest accumulation of leukemia in untreated and nilotinib-treated mice as well as partial protection of leukemic cells from the inhibitory effects of nilotinib. These studies, which showed a pattern of leukemia distribution consistent with what is observed in imatinib- and nilotinib-treated chronic myeloid leukemia patients, were followed by a more in-depth analysis of stroma-leukemia cell interactions that lead to protection of leukemia cells from nilotinib-induced cytotoxicity. For the latter, we used the human BCR-ABL-positive cell line, KU812F, and the human bone marrow stroma cell line, HS-5, to more closely approximate the bone marrow-associated cytoprotection observed in drug-treated leukemia patients. This in vitro system helped to elucidate stromal-secreted viability factors that may play a role in stromal-mediated cytoprotection of tyrosine kinase inhibitor-treated leukemia cells.","['Weisberg, Ellen', 'Wright, Renee D', 'McMillin, Douglas W', 'Mitsiades, Constantine', 'Ray, Arghya', 'Barrett, Rosemary', 'Adamia, Sophia', 'Stone, Richard', 'Galinsky, Ilene', 'Kung, Andrew L', 'Griffin, James D']","['Weisberg E', 'Wright RD', 'McMillin DW', 'Mitsiades C', 'Ray A', 'Barrett R', 'Adamia S', 'Stone R', 'Galinsky I', 'Kung AL', 'Griffin JD']","['Department of Medical Oncology/Hematologic Neoplasia, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, 44 Binney Street, Boston, MA 02115, USA.

The enzyme is widely distributed and its amino acid sequence is highly conserved among vertebrates. Fluctuations of cN-II activity have been associated with the pathogenesis of neurological disorders. The enzyme appears to be involved in the regulation of the intracellular availability of the purine precursor IMP and also of GMP and AMP, but the contribution of this activity and of its regulation to cell metabolism and to CNS cell functions remains uncertain. To address this issue, we used a vector based short hairpin RNA (shRNA) strategy to knockdown cN-II activity in human astrocytoma cells. Our results demonstrated that 53 h after transduction, cN-II mRNA was reduced to 17.9+/-0.03% of control cells. 19 h later enzyme activity was decreased from 0.7+/-0.026 mU/mg in control ADF cells to 0.45+/-0.046 mU/mg, while cell viability (evaluated by the MTT reduction assay) decreased up to 0.59+/-0.01 (fold vs control) and caspase 3 activity increased from 136+/-5.8 pmol min(-1) mg(-1) in control cells to 639+/-37.5 pmol min(-1) mg(-1) in silenced cells, thus demonstrating that cN-II is essential for cell survival. The decrease of enzyme activity causes apoptosis of the cultured cells without altering intracellular nucleotide and nucleoside concentration or energy charge. Since cN-II is highly expressed in tumour cells, our finding offers a new possible therapeutical approach especially against primary brain tumours such as glioblastoma, and to ameliorate chemotherapy against leukemia.","['Careddu, Maria Giovanna', 'Allegrini, Simone', 'Pesi, Rossana', 'Camici, Marcella', 'Garcia-Gil, Mercedes', 'Tozzi, Maria Grazia']","['Careddu MG', 'Allegrini S', 'Pesi R', 'Camici M', 'Garcia-Gil M', 'Tozzi MG']","['Dipartimento di Biologia, Universita di Pisa, Via S.

PML/RARalpha is directly targeted by all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA), which degrades the oncoprotein and induces complete remission of malignancies. The aberrant function of PML/RARalpha, together with the constitutive activation of the mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MEK/ERK) signalling pathway, regulates the ability of haematopoietic cells to proliferate, differentiate, and escape from apoptotic episodes. The role of the MEK/ERK pathway in PML/RARalpha expression, differentiation, proliferation and apoptosis in APL cells was analysed using specific MEK inhibitors. The blockade of MEK/ERK pathway resulted in caspase-dependent degradation of PML/RARalpha, and attenuation of the cell differentiation induction. To our knowledge, this is the first report to show that PML/RARalpha was suppressed by MEK/ERK inhibition, through a mechanism dependent on caspase activation. ATRA co-operated with MEK inhibitor to increase degradation of PML/RARalpha and exhibited a convergence point in caspase activation with MEK inhibitors. Taken together, our data suggest a new role of MEK/ERK pathway in the pathogenesis of APL, thus supporting the use of MEK/ERK inhibitors as an efficient therapeutic strategy for this haematological malignancy.","['Barbarroja, Nuria', 'Siendones, Emilio', 'Torres, Luis Aristides', 'Luque, Maria Jose', 'Martinez, Julio Manuel', 'Dorado, Gabriel', 'Velasco, Francisco', 'Torres, Antonio', 'Lopez-Pedrera, Chary']","['Barbarroja N', 'Siendones E', 'Torres LA', 'Luque MJ', 'Martinez JM', 'Dorado G', 'Velasco F', 'Torres A', 'Lopez-Pedrera C']","['Unidad de Investigacion, Hospital Universitario Reina Sofia, Cordoba, Spain. nuria.barbarroja.exts@juntadeandalucia.es']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*metabolism/pathology', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*metabolism', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology']",2008/05/01 09:00,2008/12/17 09:00,['2008/05/01 09:00'],"['2008/05/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['BJH7154 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2008.07154.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2008 Jul;142(1):27-35. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2008.07154.x.

In other myeloid neoplasms, however, transformation with marked basophilia and eosinophilia is considered unusual. DESIGN: We examined the long-term follow-up of 322 patients with de novo myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) to define the frequency of basophilic, eosinophilic and mixed lineage (basophilic and eosinophilic) transformation. RESULTS: Of all patients, only one developed mixed lineage crisis (>or= 20% basophils and >or= 20% eosinophils). In this patient, who initially suffered from chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia, basophils increased to 48% and eosinophils up to 31% at the time of progression. Mixed lineage crisis was not accompanied by an increase in blast cells or organomegaly. The presence of BCR/ABL and other relevant fusion gene products (FIP1L1/PDGFRA, AML1/ETO, PML/RAR alpha, CBF beta/MYH11) were excluded by PCR. Myelomastocytic transformation/myelomastocytic leukaemia and primary mast cell disease were excluded by histology, KIT mutation analysis, electron microscopy and immunophenotyping. Basophils were thus found to be CD123+, CD203c+, BB1+, KIT- cells, and to express a functional IgE-receptor. Among the other patients with MDS examined, 4(1.2%) were found to have marked basophilia (>or= 20%) and 7(2.1%) were found to have massive eosinophilia ( >or= 20%), whereas mixed-lineage crisis was detected in none of them. CONCLUSIONS: Mixed basophil/eosinophil crisis may develop in patients with MDS but is an extremely rare event.","['Wimazal, F', 'Baumgartner, C', 'Sonneck, K', 'Zauner, C', 'Geissler, P', 'Schur, S', 'Samorapoompichit, P', 'Mullauer, L', 'Fodinger, M', 'Agis, H', 'Sperr, W R', 'Valent, P']","['Wimazal F', 'Baumgartner C', 'Sonneck K', 'Zauner C', 'Geissler P', 'Schur S', 'Samorapoompichit P', 'Mullauer L', 'Fodinger M', 'Agis H', 'Sperr WR', 'Valent P']","['Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna, Austria.']",,['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Clin Invest,European journal of clinical investigation,0245331,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Basophils/*immunology', 'Disease Progression', 'Eosinophils/*immunology', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Histamine Release', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/therapeutic use', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/drug therapy/*immunology/pathology', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Middle Aged', 'Receptors, IgE/analysis', 'Retrospective Studies']",2008/05/01 09:00,2008/08/02 09:00,['2008/05/01 09:00'],"['2008/05/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/02 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['ECI1950 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2362.2008.01950.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Clin Invest. 2008 Jun;38(6):447-55. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2362.2008.01950.x.

We found a significantly high incidence of the GSTM1 null genotype in ALL children (71.7%) compared with 51.7% in the control group of children (P<0.05). The GSTT1 null genotype was observed in 35.0% and 33.3% of the ALL cases and the control subjects respectively, with no significant difference. Screening for NQO1 (609C>T) mutant alleles showed a high incidence of the NQO1 C/C genotype (NQO1 homozygous wild-type allele genotype) in 60.0% of ALL cases and was significantly higher than in the control group (23.3%) (P<0.01). These GSTM1 null and NQO1 wild-type genotypes are independently associated with the risk of ALL in Filipino patients. When these two genotypes, GSTM1 null and NQO1 C/C, were combined, the hazard rate for childhood leukaemia was significantly increased (P<0.001). We also noticed that the incidences of GSTM1 null mutations and the NQO1 C/C genotype were significantly higher among Filipinos. These findings suggest a possible role of the GSTM1 null and NQO1 C/C genotypes in the susceptibility of paediatric ALL cases in the Philippines.","['Rimando, Marilyn G', 'Chua, Mary N', ""Yuson, Ernesto d'J"", 'de Castro-Bernas, Gloria', 'Okamoto, Takashi']","['Rimando MG', 'Chua MN', 'Yuson Ed', 'de Castro-Bernas G', 'Okamoto T']","['Department of Biological Sciences, College of Science, University of Santo Tomas, Manila, The Philippines.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biosci Rep,Bioscience reports,8102797,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', 'EC 1.6.5.2 (NAD(P)H Dehydrogenase (Quinone))', 'EC 1.6.5.2 (NQO1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.5.1.- (glutathione S-transferase T1)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (glutathione S-transferase M1)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Alleles', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genotype', 'Glutathione Transferase/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Inactivation, Metabolic/genetics', 'Infant', 'NAD(P)H Dehydrogenase (Quinone)/*genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Philippines/epidemiology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/epidemiology/*genetics', 'Risk']",2008/05/01 09:00,2009/08/26 09:00,['2008/05/01 09:00'],"['2008/05/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/26 09:00 [medline]', '2008/05/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['BSR20070010 [pii]', '10.1042/BSR20070010 [doi]']",ppublish,Biosci Rep. 2008 Jun;28(3):117-24. doi: 10.1042/BSR20070010.,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After 2 wk, rats were gavaged every other day with ENU [30 mg/kg body weight (bw)] or vehicle (6 doses). Four days after the last dose of ENU, all rats were switched to AIN-93M diet and mildly feed restricted to maintain a constant food intake per bw. Rats were monitored for termination criteria and assessed for cancer development. Total cancers developed more rapidly in rats on the ND diet compared to those receiving high dose supplements of NA (P = 0.02; Gehan's generalized Wilcoxon test).

Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients' bone marrow MSCs cryopreserved for 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year were thawed and analyzed. Cryopreserved CML-MSCs have more than 90% viability. Cell-doubling time of cryopreserved CML-MSCs is 42 to 54 hours. Cells have been expanded in culture for more than 30 passages. Under suitable conditions, cryopreserved CML-MSCs have the ability of multiple lineages differentiation, including bone, endothelial, fat and nerve. Furthermore, cryopreserved CML-MSCs express hematopoietic cytokines, and possess hematopoietic supportive ability. The growth of normal long-term culture-initiating cell (LTC-IC) on CML-MSCs (including noncryopreserved and cryopreserved CML-MSCs) was similar to that of normal derived MSCs. Cryopreserved CML-MSCs did not express costimulatory molecules CD40, CD80, and CD86. They can inhibit T lymphocyte proliferation induced by mitogens. The immunosuppressive effect of cryopreserved CML-MSCs on T-cell proliferation was dose dependent. These findings indicate that cryopreserved CML derived MSCs may be a useful tool for clinical application.","['Zhao, Zhi-Gang', 'Li, Wei-Ming', 'Chen, Zhi-Chao', 'You, Yong', 'Zou, Ping']","['Zhao ZG', 'Li WM', 'Chen ZC', 'You Y', 'Zou P']","['Department of hematology and Oncology, The Oncology Hospital of Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, PR China.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cancer Invest,Cancer investigation,8307154,"['0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Cytokines)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adipocytes/cytology', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Lineage', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', '*Cryopreservation', 'Culture Media/pharmacology', 'Cytokines/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Endothelial Cells/cytology', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/analysis', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/*pathology', 'Lymphocyte Culture Test, Mixed', 'Male', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/*cytology/drug effects/immunology', 'Middle Aged', 'Neurons/cytology', 'Osteoblasts/cytology']",2008/04/30 09:00,2008/06/03 09:00,['2008/04/30 09:00'],"['2008/04/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/03 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['792707800 [pii]', '10.1080/07357900701788049 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Invest. 2008 May;26(4):391-400. doi: 10.1080/07357900701788049.,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One of the characteristic features of Onc is a synergism with a variety of other antitumor modalities. Cepharanthine (Cep), a biscoclaurine alkaloid from Stephania cepharantha Hayata, is widely used in Japan to treat variety of ailments. It also shows low toxicity to patients. The aim of the present study was to assess the interaction of these two drugs on different tumor cell lines. When human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60, histiomonocytic lymphoma U937, multiple myeloma RPMI-8228, prostate carcinoma DU 145 and prostate adenocarcinoma LNCaP cells were exposed to relatively low concentrations of Onc or Cep their growth rates were somewhat suppressed but the cells were still able to proliferate. Cell growth, however, was totally abolished in each of these cell lines when treated with Onc and Cep combined. The frequency of apoptosis was also many-fold higher in cultures treated with a combination of Onc and Cep than in respective cultures treated with Onc or Cep alone. The mechanism of the observed synergism is unclear but it may be associated with the Onc activity in targeting microRNAs and/or NFkappaB and Cep activity also targeting NFkappaB. The data suggest that the combination of these two drugs, that individually express a low toxic profile, may have strong antitumor potential.","['Ita, Masamichi', 'Halicka, H Dorota', 'Tanaka, Toshiki', 'Kurose, Akira', 'Ardelt, Barbara', 'Shogen, Kuslima', 'Darzynkiewicz, Zbigniew']","['Ita M', 'Halicka HD', 'Tanaka T', 'Kurose A', 'Ardelt B', 'Shogen K', 'Darzynkiewicz Z']","['Brander Cancer Research Institute and Department of Pathology, New York Medical College, Valhalla, New York 10595, USA.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Cancer Biol Ther,Cancer biology & therapy,101137842,"['0 (Benzylisoquinolines)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '7592YJ0J6T (cepharanthine)', 'EC 3.1.- (Ribonucleases)', 'ZE15FIT23E (ranpirnase)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis', 'Benzylisoquinolines/*administration & dosage', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Drug Synergism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Ribonucleases/*administration & dosage', 'Time Factors', 'U937 Cells']",2008/04/30 09:00,2008/11/19 09:00,['2008/04/30 09:00'],"['2008/04/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/11/19 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['6172 [pii]', '10.4161/cbt.7.7.6172 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Biol Ther. 2008 Jul;7(7):1104-8. doi: 10.4161/cbt.7.7.6172.

The role of cytokines, and splenocytes in anti-Friend leukemia virus (FLV) activity of biphalin, a synthetic opioid, and AZT was investigated in vitro. Mouse splenocytes inhibited FLV replication in Mus dunni (Dunni) cells when they were added to the cell culture. This inhibitory effect of splenocytes also was evident when cells were combined with biphalin and AZT as measured using a focus-forming assay. Under cell-free conditions, recombinant interferon gamma (IFNgamma), interleukin 2 (IL-2) and IL-4 directly inhibited the FLV reverse transcriptase (RT) activity by 27% to 36%. IFNgamma at 0.005 pg to 500 ng inhibited FLVRT activity by 61% to 80%. Acombination of 250 ng IFNgamma and 50 mug biphalin resulted in a 94% reduction of FLVRT activity, as compared with 61% inhibition by IFNgamma alone. The combination of AZT and IFNgamma, IL-2 or IL-4 also induced a stronger suppression of FLV RT activity than either cytokine or AZT used alone. In addition, cloned RT from Moloney murine leukemia virus (MMLV) was directly sensitive to inhibition by biphalin. Thus, the anti-FLV effects of splenocytes in combination with biphalin and AZT in cell culture are likely mediated to a large degree by the direct effect of cytokines. This antiviral activity of splenocytes or cytokines combined with chemotherapy, biphalin, and/or AZT, could be used as a complementary therapy to current approaches for retroviral infection and benefit acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients. In conclusion, biphalin applied primarily as a new medicine for chronic pain treatment in AIDS patients may play a significant beneficial role as a component of antiviral HIV multidrug therapies.","['Tang, Jie-Liu', 'Lipkowski, Andrzej W', 'Specter, Steven']","['Tang JL', 'Lipkowski AW', 'Specter S']","['Department of Medical Microbiology and Immunology, University of South Florida College of Medicine, 12901 N.

The few established risk factors for the development of these neoplasms include viral infections and immunological abnormalities, but their etiology remains largely unknown. Evidence suggests that certain medical conditions may be linked, through immunosuppression, to the risk of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Multiple myeloma is a neoplasm of plasma cells that accounts for approximately 15% of lymphopoietic cancers. Increases in the incidence of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and multiple myeloma in the past implicate environmental factors as potential causal agents. DESIGN AND METHODS: In the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC), 1,213 histologically confirmed incident cases of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and multiple myeloma (594 men; 619 women) were identified during a follow-up of 8.5 years. Cox proportional hazard models were used to explore the association between self-reported diabetes, diagnosed after 30 years of age, and the risk of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma overall and multiple myeloma and various lymphoma subtypes. RESULTS: We found no association between a personal history of diabetes and the risk of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma overall in men (HR: 1.28, 95% CI: 0.89-1.84), in women (HR: 0.71, 95% CI: 0.41- 1.24), or in men and women combined (HR: 1.09, 95% CI: 0.80-1.47). Among the B-non-Hodgkin's lymphoma subtypes, we observed a statistically significant increased risk of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (HR: 2.0, 95% CI: 1.04-3.86) in men, but not in women (HR: 1.07, 95% CI: 0.33-3.43). CONCLUSIONS: This prospective study did not provide evidence for a role of self-reported diabetes in the etiology of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma overall or multiple myeloma. We found an increased risk of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia among men with diabetes, but not among women. We hypothesize that diabetes may not play a causal role in the etiology of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia, though the underlying pathogenic mechanisms of both disorders may include shared genetic, host and/or environmental susceptibility factors.","['Khan, Aneire E', 'Gallo, Valentina', 'Linseisen, Jakob', 'Kaaks, Rudolf', 'Rohrmann, Sabine', 'Raaschou-Nielsen, Ole', 'Tjonneland, Anne', 'Johnsen, Hans E', 'Overvad, Kim', 'Bergmann, Manuela M', 'Boeing, Heiner', 'Benetou, Vasiliki', 'Psaltopoulou, Theodora', 'Trichopoulou, Antonia', 'Masala, Giovanna', 'Mattiello, Amalia', 'Grioni, Sara', 'Tumino, Rosario', 'Vermeulen, Roel C H', 'Peeters, Petra H M', 'Bueno-de-Mesquita, H Bas', 'Ros, Martine M', 'Lund, Eiliv', 'Ardanaz, Eva', 'Chirlaque, Maria-Dolores', 'Jakszyn, Paula', 'Larranaga, Nerea', 'Losada, Adamina', 'Becker, Nikolaus', 'Nieters, Alexandra', 'Martinez-Garcia, Carmen', 'Agren, Asa', 'Hallmans, Goran', 'Berglund, Goran', 'Manjer, Jonas', 'Allen, Naomi E', 'Key, Timothy J', 'Bingham, Sheila', 'Khaw, Kay Tee', 'Slimani, Nadia', 'Ferrari, Pietro', 'Boffetta, Paolo', 'Norat, Teresa', 'Vineis, Paolo', 'Riboli, Elio']","['Khan AE', 'Gallo V', 'Linseisen J', 'Kaaks R', 'Rohrmann S', 'Raaschou-Nielsen O', 'Tjonneland A', 'Johnsen HE', 'Overvad K', 'Bergmann MM', 'Boeing H', 'Benetou V', 'Psaltopoulou T', 'Trichopoulou A', 'Masala G', 'Mattiello A', 'Grioni S', 'Tumino R', 'Vermeulen RC', 'Peeters PH', 'Bueno-de-Mesquita HB', 'Ros MM', 'Lund E', 'Ardanaz E', 'Chirlaque MD', 'Jakszyn P', 'Larranaga N', 'Losada A', 'Becker N', 'Nieters A', 'Martinez-Garcia C', 'Agren A', 'Hallmans G', 'Berglund G', 'Manjer J', 'Allen NE', 'Key TJ', 'Bingham S', 'Khaw KT', 'Slimani N', 'Ferrari P', 'Boffetta P', 'Norat T', 'Vineis P', 'Riboli E']","[""Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, Division of Epidemiology, Public Health and Primary Care, Imperial College London, St Mary's Campus, Variety Wing, Norfolk Place, Paddington, London W2 1PG. aneire.khan@imperial.ac.uk""]",['EPIC Group'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Comorbidity', 'Diabetes Complications/*diagnosis', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/pathology', 'Europe', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*complications/*diagnosis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/*complications/*diagnosis', 'Nutritional Sciences', 'Prospective Studies', 'Risk']",2008/04/30 09:00,2008/09/16 09:00,['2008/04/30 09:00'],"['2008/04/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/16 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.12297 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.12297 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2008 Jun;93(6):842-50. doi: 10.3324/haematol.12297.

Based on follow-up data through 2004 from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program, overall relative 3-year survival rates for MDS and CMD were 45% and 80%, respectively, with males experiencing poorer survival than females. Applying the observed age-specific incidence rates to US Census population estimates, approximately 9700 patients with MDS and 6300 patients with CMD were estimated for the entire United States in 2004. MDS incidence rates significantly increased with calendar year in 2001 through 2004, and only 4% of patients were reported to registries by physicians' offices.

The amino acid sequence, 'CTLPHLKMC' was obtained with the highest frequency from a nonapeptide-expressing phage library. The phage clone encoding CTLPHLKMC peptide sequence avidly bound to Raji cells compared with control phage clones. Furthermore, flow-cytometric analysis on the biotinylated synthetic CTLPHLKMC peptide demonstrated the high binding affinity to Raji cells in a dose-dependent manner whereas it has binding activity to neither human peripheral blood mononuclear cells including normal B cell derived from healthy donors nor other leukemia cells including THP-1, HL-60, Jurkat and IM-9. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry following immunoprecipitation assay showed that a potential host receptor for the peptide is a variable region of human immunoglobulin heavy chain which would be a specific phenotypic marker of Raji. In conclusion, these results suggest that the peptide, 'CTLPHLKMC', is a specific ligand to a Raji cell.","['Choi, Jin Huk', 'Lee, Woon Kyu', 'Han, Seung Hyun', 'Ha, Seckho', 'Ahn, Sung Min', 'Kang, Jae Seong', 'Choi, Yun Jaie', 'Yun, Cheol-Heui']","['Choi JH', 'Lee WK', 'Han SH', 'Ha S', 'Ahn SM', 'Kang JS', 'Choi YJ', 'Yun CH']","['Laboratory of Protein Engineering and Comparative Immunology, School of Agricultural Biotechnology, Seoul National University, Seoul 151-921, Republic of Korea.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Int Immunopharmacol,International immunopharmacology,100965259,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Peptide Library)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/*metabolism', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*metabolism', 'Ligands', 'Oligopeptides/*metabolism', 'Peptide Library', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization']",2008/04/30 09:00,2008/08/19 09:00,['2008/04/30 09:00'],"['2007/11/26 00:00 [received]', '2008/01/23 00:00 [revised]', '2008/01/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/04/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/19 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1567-5769(08)00052-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.intimp.2008.01.037 [doi]']",ppublish,Int Immunopharmacol. 2008 Jun;8(6):852-8. doi: 10.1016/j.intimp.2008.01.037.

It is not yet known if similar differences exist in the inosine 5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH; EC 1.1.1.205), the rate-limiting enzyme of the thiopurine synthesis. To test this, we established and validated a high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC)-based assay to determine the IMPDH enzyme activity in erythrocytes. The remarkable features of this assay are its simple erythrocyte separation/haemolysis and assay conditions and a distinct segregation of xanthosine 5'-monophosphate (XMP) from the clear supernatant after precipitation. The probes were processed without a time-consuming extraction and heating procedure and the assay demonstrated a good intra- and interday stability as well as a recovery rate of approximately 100%. The IMPDH enzyme activity was measured in erythrocytes of 75 children with diagnosis of ALL before starting antileukaemic therapy and their activity compared to those of 35 healthy adult controls. The measured enzyme activity was wide ranging in both groups.

Development of recombinant DNA techniques in the 1970s and their application to the study of mouse tumor viruses facilitated the assembly of the first gene transfer vectors. Vectors of several different types have now been developed for specific applications and over the past decade, efficacy has been demonstrated in many animal models. Clinical trials began in 1989 and by 2002 there was unequivocal evidence that children with severe combined immunodeficiency could be cured by gene transfer into primitive hematopoietic cells. Emerging from these successful trials was the realization that proto-oncogene activation by retroviral integration could contribute to leukemia. Much current effort is focused on development of safer vectors. Successful gene therapy applications have also been developed for control of graft-versus-host disease and treatment of various viral infections, leukemias, and lymphomas. The hemophilias seem amenable to gene therapy intervention and informative clinical trials have been conducted. The hemoglobin disorders, an early target for gene therapy, have proved particularly challenging although ongoing research is yielding new information that may ultimately lead to successful clinical trials.","['Nienhuis, Arthur W']",['Nienhuis AW'],"[""Division of Experimental Hematology, Department of Hematology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105, USA. arthur.nienhuis@stjude.org""]",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['Animals', 'Genetic Therapy/*methods', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Hematologic Diseases/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Treatment Outcome']",2008/04/29 09:00,2008/07/17 09:00,['2008/04/29 09:00'],"['2008/04/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/29 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)41129-2 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2007-11-078121 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2008 May 1;111(9):4431-44. doi: 10.1182/blood-2007-11-078121.,9,154,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The central hypothesis requires that B lymphocytes or hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPC) present at the ""portal of entry (POE)"" undergo sustained mutagenic change as a result of direct FA exposure. These modified cells would then migrate back to the bone marrow or primary lymphatic tissue and subsequently develop into specific LHP disease states. Chemical interaction at the POE is an absolute requirement for the hypothesized MOA as there is no convincing evidence that inhaled FA causes distant site (e.g., bone marrow) toxicity. The purpose of this review is to critically evaluate this proposed MOA within the context of the existing data concerning the toxicokinetic and biological properties of FA, the current understanding of the induction of chemically-induced leukemias and lymphomas, as well as within EPA's specific guidelines for evaluating the MOA of chemically-induced cancers. Specifically, we examine the scientific support for the hypothesis that FA exposure may induce carcinogenic transformation of localized lymphocytes or peripheral hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPC) in the absence of discernable systemic hematopoietic toxicity (i.e., peripheral transformation). While little or no empirical evidence exists upon which to fully evaluate the proposed hypothesis, available data does not support the proposed concept of ""peripheral transformation"" at the chemical entry site. Numerous animal bioassays evaluating chronic inhalation of FA clearly do not support this hypothesis since no properly conducted study as ever shown an increase in any LHP malignancy. Moreover, the notion that FA can cause any LHP malignancy is not supported with either epidemiologic data or current understanding of differing etiologies and risk factors for the various hematopoietic and lymphoproliferative malignancies. It is therefore concluded that existing science does not support the proposed MOA as a logical explanation for proposing that FA is a realistic etiological factor for any LHP malignancy.","['Pyatt, David', 'Natelson, Ethan', 'Golden, Robert']","['Pyatt D', 'Natelson E', 'Golden R']","['Summit Toxicology, L.L.P., 509 N Bermont, Lafayette, CO 80026, USA. dpyatt@summittoxicology.com']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,Regul Toxicol Pharmacol,Regulatory toxicology and pharmacology : RTP,8214983,"['0 (Carcinogens, Environmental)', '1HG84L3525 (Formaldehyde)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Carcinogens, Environmental/pharmacokinetics/*toxicity', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Formaldehyde/pharmacokinetics/*toxicity', 'Humans', 'Inhalation Exposure', 'Leukemia/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Lymphoma/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Occupational Exposure', 'Risk Assessment', 'Stem Cells/drug effects']",2008/04/29 09:00,2008/08/01 09:00,['2008/04/29 09:00'],"['2007/12/18 00:00 [received]', '2008/02/26 00:00 [revised]', '2008/03/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/04/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/01 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/29 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0273-2300(08)00050-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.yrtph.2008.03.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Regul Toxicol Pharmacol. 2008 Jun;51(1):119-33. doi: 10.1016/j.yrtph.2008.03.003.

OBJECTIVE: To characterize the presentation of SCC in situ in immunosuppressed patients compared with patients with normal immune function. METHODS: A retrospective comparative university-based study, reviewing charts with histologically confirmed Bowen's disease diagnosed between January 1999 and January 2003. RESULTS: Two hundred ninety-nine patients (193 men, 106 women) with 407 SCC in situ tumors were included. Fifty-seven patients (19%) were immunocompromised, including 43 organ transplant recipients, 7 patients with acute and chronic leukemia, and 6 patients with immune-suppressing infections or autoimmune disease. Immunocompromised patients were significantly younger (mean, 61.7 years) than non-immunocompromised patients, 72.6 years, P < .0001) and were more often male (P = .0115). Immunocompromised patients were significantly more likely to have multiple SCC in situ tumors (33% vs 15%; P = .012). Immunocompromised patients were also more likely to present with tumors on the trunk and extremities (odds ratio [OR], 2.03; P = .0019) and particularly on the neck (OR 3.7; P = .00075) than were non-immunocompromised patients. Overall, 11 patients (3.7%) developed a histologically confirmed recurrence of SCC in situ after apparently adequate surgical treatment. The rate of recurrence was higher in immunocompromised (9%) than in non-immunocompromised patients (3%; P = .039). LIMITATIONS: The mean follow-up duration of 35 months may underestimate the recurrence rate. CONCLUSIONS: Immunocompromised patients are at significant risk of SCC in situ, and SCC in situ in this population is likely to occur multiply and behave more aggressively. Close dermatologic surveillance of these patients is warranted.","['Drake, Ashley L', 'Walling, Hobart W']","['Drake AL', 'Walling HW']","['Department of Dermatology, University of Iowa, Iowa City, Iowa, USA.']",,['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Am Acad Dermatol,Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology,7907132,,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', ""Bowen's Disease/*diagnosis/epidemiology/*immunology"", 'Carcinoma in Situ/*diagnosis/epidemiology/*immunology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host/*immunology', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/epidemiology', 'Neoplasms, Multiple Primary/epidemiology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Skin Neoplasms/*diagnosis/epidemiology/*immunology']",2008/04/29 09:00,2008/07/04 09:00,['2008/04/29 09:00'],"['2007/12/11 00:00 [received]', '2008/03/02 00:00 [revised]', '2008/03/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/04/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/04 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/29 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0190-9622(08)00397-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jaad.2008.03.028 [doi]']",ppublish,J Am Acad Dermatol. 2008 Jul;59(1):68-71. doi: 10.1016/j.jaad.2008.03.028.

Mammalian FEZ1 has already been reported to cooperate with PKC-zeta in the differentiation and polarization of PC12 neuronal cells. Furthermore, FEZ1 is associated with kinesin 1 and JIP1 to form a cargo-complex responsible for microtubule based transport of mitochondria along axons. FEZ1 can also be classified as a hub protein, since it was reported to interact with over 40 different proteins in yeast two-hybrid screens, including at least nine nuclear proteins. Here, we transiently over-expressed GFP-FEZ1full in human HEK293 and HeLa cells in order to study the sub-cellular localization of GFP-FEZ1. We observed that over 40% of transiently transfected cells at 3 days post-transfection develop multi-lobulated nuclei, which are also called flower-like nuclei. We further demonstrated that GFP-FEZ1 localizes either to the cytoplasm or the nuclear fraction, and that the appearance of the flower-like nuclei depends on intact microtubule function. Finally, we show that FEZ1 co-localizes with both, alpha- and especially with gamma-tubulin, which localizes as a centrosome like structure at the center of the multiple lobules. In summary, our data suggest that FEZ1 has an important centrosomal function and supply new mechanistic insights to the formation of flower-like nuclei, which are a phenotypical hallmark of human leukemia cells.","['Lanza, Daniel C F', 'Trindade, Daniel M', 'Assmann, Eliana M', 'Kobarg, Jorg']","['Lanza DC', 'Trindade DM', 'Assmann EM', 'Kobarg J']","['Laboratorio Nacional de Luz Sincrotron, Campinas SP, Brazil; Instituto de Biologia, Universidade Estadual de Campinas, Campinas, SP, Brazil.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Caenorhabditis elegans Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (FEZ1 protein, human)', '0 (LZTS1 protein, human)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Neuropeptides)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Tubulin)', '0 (Tubulin Modulators)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (UNC-76 protein, C elegans)', 'SH1WY3R615 (Nocodazole)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Caenorhabditis elegans Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Centrosome/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Microtubules/*metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins', 'Neuropeptides/genetics/metabolism', 'Nocodazole/metabolism', 'Phenotype', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Sequence Analysis, Protein', 'Tubulin/metabolism', 'Tubulin Modulators/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics/*metabolism']",2008/04/29 09:00,2008/07/24 09:00,['2008/04/29 09:00'],"['2007/10/19 00:00 [received]', '2008/02/20 00:00 [revised]', '2008/02/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/04/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/24 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/29 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0014-4827(08)00105-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.yexcr.2008.02.012 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 2008 Jun 10;314(10):2028-39. doi: 10.1016/j.yexcr.2008.02.012.

The dynamics of endocytic pathways is modified in a number of diseases, including cancer, and notably in multidrug resistant (MDR) cells that are refractory to the effects of several anti-cancer agents. These cells often upregulate expression of drug-efflux pumps but this may be synergistic with alternative resistance mechanisms including increased acidification of endocytic organelles that enhances vesicular sequestration of weak-base anti-cancer drugs such as daunorubicin away from their nuclear target. Here, we characterised the distribution of sequestered daunorubicin in commonly used leukaemia cell lines, HL-60, K562, KG1a and the multidrug resistant HL-60/ADR line, and related this to the spatial distribution of their endocytic organelles and microtubule networks. HL-60 and KG1a cells contained microtubule arrays emanating from organising centres, and their endocytic organelles and daunorubicin labelled vesicles were scattered throughout the cytoplasm. HL-60/ADR and K562 cells showed extensive clustering of early and recycling endosomes, late endosomes, lysosomes and daunorubicin to a juxtanuclear region but these cells lacked microtubule arrays. Microtubular organisation within these clustered regions was however, required for spatial tethering of endocytic organelles and the Golgi, as treatment with nocodazole and paclitaxel had major effects on their distribution. HL-60 and HL-60/ADR cells had similar lysosomal pH of <5.0 and overall these findings suggests a general relationship between the absence of microtubule arrays and the propensity of leukaemia cell lines to cluster endocytic organelles and daunorubicin into the juxtanuclear region.","['Jin, Jing', 'Pastrello, Davide', 'Penning, Neal A', 'Jones, Arwyn T']","['Jin J', 'Pastrello D', 'Penning NA', 'Jones AT']","['Welsh School of Pharmacy, Cardiff University, Cardiff CF10 3XF, Wales, UK.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Int J Biochem Cell Biol,The international journal of biochemistry & cell biology,9508482,"['0 (Transferrin)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Centrosome/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Daunorubicin/pharmacology', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', '*Endocytosis/drug effects', 'Endosomes/drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration/drug effects', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology', 'Lysosomes/drug effects/metabolism', 'Microtubules/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Models, Biological', 'Organelles/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Protein Transport/drug effects', 'Subcellular Fractions/metabolism', 'Transferrin/metabolism']",2008/04/29 09:00,2008/10/03 09:00,['2008/04/29 09:00'],"['2008/01/23 00:00 [received]', '2008/02/28 00:00 [revised]', '2008/03/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/04/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/03 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/29 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1357-2725(08)00115-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.biocel.2008.03.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Biochem Cell Biol. 2008;40(10):2240-52. doi: 10.1016/j.biocel.2008.03.004.

METHODS: Electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) and NMR were used to identify the chemical structure of compounds formed when DMSO reacts with cisplatin. We studied the reactivity of the identified compound with DNA. In vitro toxicity studies in neurons and cancer cells and in vivo toxicity studies in rats were used to determine both the cancer chemotherapeutic and toxic effects of the identified compound. RESULTS: Cisplatin binds rapidly with DMSO to form a DMSO adduct. The resulting compound has reduced ability to bind to double-stranded DNA both in vitro and in cells. This compound has reduced toxicity for cancer cells and neurons in vitro. In vivo nephrotoxicity studies show that the adducted compound has different nephrotoxicity and elimination characteristics than cisplatin. CONCLUSIONS: From this work, we conclude that dissolving cisplatin in DMSO results in formation of an adducted compound with different therapeutic and biological characteristics. Furthermore, future studies which propose using DMSO in combination with cisplatin for chemotherapeutic treatment in patients must be reconsidered. Due to the rapidity and nature of the reaction, DMSO and cisplatin should not be combined for patient treatment.","['Fischer, Stephanie J', 'Benson, Linda M', 'Fauq, Abdul', 'Naylor, Stephen', 'Windebank, Anthony J']","['Fischer SJ', 'Benson LM', 'Fauq A', 'Naylor S', 'Windebank AJ']","['Molecular Neuroscience Program, Mayo Graduate School, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905, USA.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",Netherlands,Neurotoxicology,Neurotoxicology,7905589,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA Adducts)', '0 (DNA, Single-Stranded)', '0 (Solutions)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*chemistry/*toxicity', 'Cell Survival/*drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cisplatin/*chemistry/*toxicity', 'DNA/chemistry/drug effects', 'DNA Adducts/*chemistry/*toxicity', 'DNA, Single-Stranded/chemistry/metabolism', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/*chemistry/*toxicity', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia L1210/metabolism', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Neurons/drug effects', 'Neurotoxicity Syndromes/*pathology', 'PC12 Cells', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Solutions', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization']",2008/04/29 09:00,2008/08/30 09:00,['2008/04/29 09:00'],"['2008/02/13 00:00 [received]', '2008/02/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/04/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/30 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/29 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0161-813X(08)00021-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.neuro.2008.02.010 [doi]']",ppublish,Neurotoxicology. 2008 May;29(3):444-52. doi: 10.1016/j.neuro.2008.02.010.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Analysis included 104 patients with MDS (24 refractory anemia, 32 refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts, 34 refractory anemia with excess of blasts, 7 refractory anemia with excess of blasts in transformation to acute leukemia, and 7 chronic myelo-monocytic leukemia), 3 patients with acute myeloid leukemia from MDS, and 36 patients with myeloproliferative disease (23 chronic myeloid leukemia, 9 polycythemia vera, 4 idiopathic myelofibrosis). Mutation scanning was performed using heteroduplex analysis with denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (dHPLC). The entire mitochondrial genome was amplified in 67 overlapping polymerase chain reaction fragments carefully optimized regarding DNA melting profiles. Abnormal dHPLC findings were confirmed by DNA sequencing. RESULTS: Heteroplasmic mtDNA mutations, mostly transitions, were identified in 56% of MDS and 44% of myeloproliferative disorders patients. In MDS, mutation frequency increased with age and more-advanced disease. Mutational spectra showed no hot spots and were similar in different types of MDS. Heteroplasmic mutations generally did not represent known polymorphisms, and about half of them affected conserved amino acids or nucleotides. Mutations were less frequent in protein encoding genes (50 per 10(6) base pairs) than other mitochondrial genes (transfer RNAs, ribosomal RNAs, and control region; about 80 per 10(6) base pairs). CONCLUSIONS: As mitochondria often show ultrastructural abnormalities in MDS, including pathological iron accumulation, mitochondrial dysfunction may contribute to MDS pathology. We found a high frequency of acquired mtDNA mutations in MDS. However, their functional importance remains unclear, considering that genotype correlates poorly with phenotype in mitochondrial diseases. The clonally expanded mtDNA mutations in MDS support the concept of age-related damage to mtDNA in hematopoietic stem cells.","['Wulfert, Michael', 'Kupper, Anna C', 'Tapprich, Christoph', 'Bottomley, Sylvia S', 'Bowen, David', 'Germing, Ulrich', 'Haas, Rainer', 'Gattermann, Norbert']","['Wulfert M', 'Kupper AC', 'Tapprich C', 'Bottomley SS', 'Bowen D', 'Germing U', 'Haas R', 'Gattermann N']","['Klinik fur Hamatologie, Onkologie und Klinische Immunologie, Heinrich-Heine-Universitat, Dusseldorf, Germany.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (DNA, Mitochondrial)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid/methods', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'DNA, Mitochondrial/*genetics', 'Disease Progression', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",2008/04/29 09:00,2008/09/06 09:00,['2008/04/29 09:00'],"['2007/08/20 00:00 [received]', '2008/01/15 00:00 [revised]', '2008/01/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/04/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/06 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/29 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-472X(08)00020-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2008.01.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2008 May;36(5):577-86. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2008.01.004.,5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Stimulation of neutrophils with TNF-alpha and GM-CSF caused phosphorylation of p54 or p46 JNK or both. The phosphorylated p46 JNK band in TNF-alpha-stimulated neutrophils mobilized faster than that in GM-CSF-stimulated cells. The JNK isoform transcripts expressed in neutrophils were JNK1beta1, JNK1beta2, JNK2alpha1, and JNK2alpha2. The JNK isoforms phosphorylated by TNF-alpha and GM-CSF stimulation were found to be JNK1 and JNK2, respectively, on the basis of the molecular mass and the capture assay. TNF-alpha-induced JNK phosphorylation was sustained in the presence of cycloheximide, which was accompanied by accelerated neutrophil apoptosis. The JNK inhibitors (SP600125 and TAT-TI-JIP(153163)) suppressed neutrophil apoptosis induced by TNF-alpha plus cycloheximide, whereas they attenuated the GM-CSF-mediated antiapoptotic effect on neutrophils. The JNK inhibitor did not affect the levels of Mcl-1 and XIAP (antiapoptotic molecules), which were regulated by TNF-alpha plus cycloheximide and GM-CSF. The JNK inhibitor markedly suppressed TNF-alpha-induced and GM-CSF-induced superoxide release. These findings suggest that JNK1 and JNK2 are involved in TNF-alpha-induced neutrophil apoptosis and GM-CSF-mediated antiapoptotic effect on neutrophils, respectively, and both JNK isoforms are involved in TNF-alpha-induced and GM-CSF-induced superoxide release.","['Kato, Takayuki', 'Noma, Haruyoshi', 'Kitagawa, Maki', 'Takahashi, Tatsuji', 'Oshitani, Nobuhide', 'Kitagawa, Seiichi']","['Kato T', 'Noma H', 'Kitagawa M', 'Takahashi T', 'Oshitani N', 'Kitagawa S']","['Department of Physiology, Osaka City University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Interferon Cytokine Res,Journal of interferon & cytokine research : the official journal of the International Society for Interferon and Cytokine Research,9507088,"['0 (Anthracenes)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BCL2L11 protein, human)', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein)', '0 (XIAP protein, human)', '11062-77-4 (Superoxides)', '1TW30Y2766 (pyrazolanthrone)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.1.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 9)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 8)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Anthracenes/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/metabolism', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/metabolism', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/metabolism', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 8/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 9/metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neutrophils/*cytology/drug effects/*enzymology', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Superoxides/metabolism', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*pharmacology', 'X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein/metabolism']",2008/04/29 09:00,2008/10/04 09:00,['2008/04/29 09:00'],"['2008/04/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/04 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/29 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/jir.2007.0075 [doi]'],ppublish,J Interferon Cytokine Res. 2008 Apr;28(4):235-43. doi: 10.1089/jir.2007.0075.,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

TAL-1 deletion is the most common genetic abnormality in T-ALL. OBJECTIVES: The present study was aimed to detect the incidence of type 1 and type 2 TAL-1 deletions and assess whether they might contribute to the high incidence of T-ALL in South India. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 45 cases of T-ALL (pediatric-32, adolescents-7 and young adults-6) were studied by DNA-PCR and sequencing. Age of the patients ranged from 3 yrs to 29 yrs (median age 14 yrs). RESULTS: TAL-1 deletion type 1 was detected in 6 (13.3%) cases (3 pediatric and 3 adolescents) and all were males. TAL-1 deletion type 2 was not present. Comparing the clinical features and immunological marker analysis of TAL-1 deletion positive and negative cases did not show any significant differences except in the WBC count, which was significantly higher in cases showing TAL-1 deletion (>100 x 109/L, p value= 0.003). All the positive cases of TAL-1 deletion were confirmed by sequencing, the results showing that the fusion region at SIL gene and TAL-1 gene contained an average 'N region' insertion of 7.8 nucleotides. The numbers of nucleotides deleted at the 5' end and 3' end of TAL-1 gene were averages of 3 and 1, respectively. CONCLUSION: Though the incidence of T-ALL is high in South India, the frequency of TAL-1 deletion and their fusion gene sequences are not unique and are similar to those reported in other ethnic and geographic populations. Hence the present study indicates that TAL-1 deletion alone does not contribute to the high incidence of T-ALL in South Indian patients.","['Sudhakar, N', 'Nirmala, K', 'Rajalekshmy, K R', 'Rajkumar, T']","['Sudhakar N', 'Nirmala K', 'Rajalekshmy KR', 'Rajkumar T']","['Department of Molecular Oncology, Cancer Institute WIA, Chennai 600036, Tamil Nadu, India. nsudha79@rediffmail.com']",,['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Thailand,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,101130625,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '135471-20-4 (TAL1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'India/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/epidemiology/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Sequence Deletion', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'Young Adult']",2008/04/29 09:00,2009/02/20 09:00,['2008/04/29 09:00'],"['2008/04/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/02/20 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/29 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev. 2008 Jan-Mar;9(1):127-30.,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As well, the mechanism involved remains to be elucidated. To induce DAergic differentiation from NPCs, a cytokine mixture (C-Mix) of interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-11, leukemia-inhibitory factor (LIF), and glial-derived neurotrophic factor or low oxygen (3.5% O(2): L-Oxy) was used to treat embryonic stem (ES) cell-derived NPCs. Treatment with C-Mix increased the number of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive cells compared with controls (2.20-fold of control). The C-Mix effect was induced by mainly LIF or IL-1beta treatment. Although L-Oxy caused an increase in TH-positive cells (1.34-fold), the combination of L-Oxy with C-Mix did not show an additive effect. Increases in DA in the medium were shown in the presence of C-Mix, LIF, and L-Oxy by high-performance liquid chromatography. Gene expression patterns of neural markers [tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH), GAD67, GluT1, beta-tubulin III, glial fibrillary acidc protein, and TH] were different in C-Mix and L-Oxy treatments. Because increases in hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1alpha protein were found in both treatments, we investigated the effect of HIF-1alpha on differentiation of NPCs to DAergic neurons. Inhibition of HIF-1alpha by the application of antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) to NPCs caused a decrease in TH-positive cells induced by LIF treatment. Gene expressions of TH, GAD67, and GluT1 were decreased, and those of TPH, beta-tubulin III, and S-100beta were increased by treatment with just ODNs, indicating the importance of the endogenous effect of HIF-1alpha on neuronal differentiation. These data suggest that enhanced differentiation into DAergic neurons from ES cell-derived NPCs was induced by C-Mix or L-Oxy mediated by HIF-1alpha.","['Kim, Tae-Sun', 'Misumi, Sachiyo', 'Jung, Cha-Gyun', 'Masuda, Tadashi', 'Isobe, Yoshiaki', 'Furuyama, Fujiya', 'Nishino, Hitoo', 'Hida, Hideki']","['Kim TS', 'Misumi S', 'Jung CG', 'Masuda T', 'Isobe Y', 'Furuyama F', 'Nishino H', 'Hida H']","['Department of Neurophysiology and Brain Science, Nagoya City University Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Nagoya, Japan.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Neurosci Res,Journal of neuroscience research,7600111,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Hif1a protein, mouse)', '0 (Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit)', 'EC 1.14.16.2 (Tyrosine 3-Monooxygenase)', 'S88TT14065 (Oxygen)', 'VTD58H1Z2X (Dopamine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Culture Techniques/methods', 'Cell Differentiation/*physiology', 'Cell Hypoxia/physiology', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Dopamine/*metabolism', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/*cytology/metabolism', 'Gene Expression', 'Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit/*metabolism', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Mice', 'Neurons/*cytology/metabolism', 'Oxygen/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tyrosine 3-Monooxygenase/biosynthesis']",2008/04/29 09:00,2008/10/01 09:00,['2008/04/29 09:00'],"['2008/04/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/01 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/29 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jnr.21687 [doi]'],ppublish,J Neurosci Res. 2008 Aug 15;86(11):2353-62. doi: 10.1002/jnr.21687.,11,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: To assess acute care hospital mortality of schizophrenic patients, we analyzed hospital mortality, the risk factors for hospital mortality, and the causes of death of schizophrenic patients admitted to an acute care hospital in Japan over an 18-year period. RESULTS: We identified 55 deaths among 1108 schizophrenic patients, for a mortality rate of 5.0%. The overall standardized mortality ratio was 1.29 (95% CI, 0.98-1.68) compared with nonschizophrenic hospitalized patients. Significant risk factors for mortality were malignant neoplasm, cardiovascular disease, and admission through the emergency department. The leading causes of death in acute care hospitalizations were suicide (14.5%), malignant lymphoma or leukemia (10.9%), stroke (9.0%), and sepsis (7.3%). CONCLUSIONS: There was a nearly significant trend toward increased mortality of schizophrenic patients receiving acute hospital care compared with that of nonschizophrenic patients. Because suicide was the most frequent cause of death, a focus on suicide prevention is needed in this population.","['Tokuda, Yasuharu', 'Obara, Haruo', 'Nakazato, Nobuhiko', 'Stein, Gerald H']","['Tokuda Y', 'Obara H', 'Nakazato N', 'Stein GH']","[""Division of General Internal Medicine, Department of Medicine, St Luke's International Hospital, Tokyo, Japan. tokuyasu@orange.ocn.ne.jp""]",,['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Hosp Med,Journal of hospital medicine,101271025,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Cause of Death', 'Female', '*Hospital Mortality/trends', 'Hospitals, Community/statistics & numerical data', 'Hospitals, Teaching/statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Japan/epidemiology', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Registries', 'Risk Factors', 'Schizophrenia/*mortality']",2008/04/29 09:00,2008/06/13 09:00,['2008/04/29 09:00'],"['2008/04/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/13 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/29 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jhm.256 [doi]'],ppublish,J Hosp Med. 2008 Mar;3(2):110-6. doi: 10.1002/jhm.256.,2,,,,,,,['(c) 2008 Society of Hospital Medicine.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

FA patients are particularly susceptible to leukemia as well as squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) of the head and neck, anogenital region and skin. Thirteen complementation groups and the corresponding FA genes have been identified, and their protein products assemble into nuclear core complexes during DNA-damage responses. Much progress has been made in our understanding of post-translational FA protein modifications and physical interactions. By contrast, little is known about the control of protein availability at the level of transcription. We report here that multiple FA proteins were downregulated during the proliferative arrest of primary human keratinocytes and HeLa cells, and that the observed regulation was at a transcriptional level. Proliferative stimuli such as expression of HPV16 E7 as well as E2F1 overexpression in primary cells resulted in coordinate FA upregulation. To define the underlying mechanism, we examined the endogenous FANCD2 promoter, and detected regulated binding of members of the E2F/Rb family in chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. Finally, a 1 kb promoter fragment was sufficient to confer E2F/Rb regulation in reporter assays. Taken together, our data demonstrate FA gene co-regulation in synchrony with the cell cycle and suggest that deregulated expression of individual FA genes-in addition to FA gene mutation-may promote FA-related human cancer.","['Hoskins, E E', 'Gunawardena, R W', 'Habash, K B', 'Wise-Draper, T M', 'Jansen, M', 'Knudsen, E S', 'Wells, S I']","['Hoskins EE', 'Gunawardena RW', 'Habash KB', 'Wise-Draper TM', 'Jansen M', 'Knudsen ES', 'Wells SI']","[""1Division of Hematology/Oncology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH 45229, USA.""]",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (E2F Transcription Factors)', '0 (Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group Proteins)']",IM,"['E2F Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Fanconi Anemia/*genetics', 'Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation', '*Genes, Retinoblastoma', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic']",2008/04/29 09:00,2008/09/03 09:00,['2008/04/29 09:00'],"['2008/04/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/03 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/29 09:00 [entrez]']","['onc2008121 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2008.121 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2008 Aug 14;27(35):4798-808. doi: 10.1038/onc.2008.121.

Bitransgenic mice overexpressing either Pim-1 or Pim-2 and c-Myc succumb to pre-B-cell lymphoma at a strikingly accelerated speed. Despite that Pim-1/Pim-2 has long been recognized as a strong synergistic partner with c-Myc in tumorigenesis, the mechanism underlying the synergism is still not well understood. Overexpression of Pim-1/Pim-2 kinase dramatically stabilizes c-Myc in vivo, and the stabilization is partially mediated by phosphorylation of c-Myc by Pim kinase on a novel site, Ser329. We provide evidence that Pim-2 is more efficient in directly phosphorylating c-Myc Ser329 to stabilize c-Myc. In contrast, we find that Pim-1 is more effective in mediating a decrease in c-Myc Thr58 phosphorylation and an increase in c-Myc Ser62 phosphorylation than in phosphorylating Ser329. In either case, through stabilizing c-Myc, Pim-1/Pim-2 kinases enhance the transcriptional activity of c-Myc. Also knocking down either Pim-1 or Pim-2 dramatically decreases the endogenous levels of c-Myc and thus, its transcriptional activity. Finally, coexpression of the Pim kinases and c-Myc enhances the transforming activity of c-Myc as does the phosphomimic mutant of c-Myc on Ser329. We conclude that these findings appear to explain at least in part the mechanism underlying the synergism between the Pim kinases and c-Myc in tumorigenesis.","['Zhang, Y', 'Wang, Z', 'Li, X', 'Magnuson, N S']","['Zhang Y', 'Wang Z', 'Li X', 'Magnuson NS']","['School of Molecular Biosciences, Washington State University, Pullman, WA 99163, USA.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-pim-1)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (proto-oncogene proteins pim)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Genes, myc', 'Hydrolysis', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-pim-1/*metabolism']",2008/04/29 09:00,2008/09/03 09:00,['2008/04/29 09:00'],"['2008/04/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/03 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/29 09:00 [entrez]']","['onc2008123 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2008.123 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2008 Aug 14;27(35):4809-19. doi: 10.1038/onc.2008.123.

The anti-LMO2 single chain Fv, obtained using Intracellular Antibody Capture (IAC) technology, is specific for LMO2 among the LIM-only protein family and binds LMO2 through the third and fourth LIM fingers.

We also demonstrate inhibition of Lmo2-dependent leukaemia in a mouse T-cell tumourigenesis transplantation assay with retroviral-mediated expression of anti-LMO2 scFv. Our studies establish that interference with the LMO2 multiprotein complex inhibits both normal and tumourigenic roles.

However, it was virtually impossible to attain any appreciable damage of lymphocytes from healthy donors even with the highest treatment doses (5 mM ALA, 150 J/cm(2)). High sensitivity to ALA-PDT of malignant lymphocytes was confirmed in experiments with human T- and B-cell leukemic cell lines, and in these experiments, an anomalous reaction to the treatment of Raji cells was also detected. The mechanisms of the difference between normal and malignant lymphocytes are discussed in terms of altered heme-synthesis processes in malignant cells. CONCLUSIONS: 1) It is shown for the first time that blood lymphocytes from lymphatic leukemia patients are highly sensitive to the damage with ALA-PDT while lymphocytes of normal donors are practically not damaged. 2) Transformed lymphocytes of human T-cell lines are more sensitive than lymphocytes of B-cell lines. 3) Lymphocytes of the Raji line display anomalous dose-effect dependence with ALA-PDT. 4) It is proposed to evaluate the drastic difference in ALA-PDT responsiveness of normal and malignant lymphocytes as a possible simple and low-traumatic test for B-CLL screening among the elderly people.","['Gamaleia, N F', 'Shishko, E D', 'Gluzman, D F', 'Sklyarenko, L M']","['Gamaleia NF', 'Shishko ED', 'Gluzman DF', 'Sklyarenko LM']","['R.E.

AIM: To investigate further this effect we have studied the influence of amifostine on idarubicin-induced DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and apoptosis. METHODS: We employed pulse-field gel electrophoresis () for the detection of DSBs and assessment of their repair in human normal lymphocytes and chronic myelogenous leukaemia K562 cells lacking p53 activity and expressing the BCR/ABL tyrosine kinase. Apoptosis was evaluated by caspase-3 activity assay assisted by the alkaline comet assay and DAPI staining. RESULTS: Idarubicin induced DSBs in a dose-independent manner in normal and cancer cells. Both types of the cells did not repair these lesions in 120 min and amifostine differentially modulated their level - decreased it in the lymphocytes and increased in K562 cells. In contrast to control cells, amifostine potentated apoptotic DNA fragmentation, chromatin condensation and the activity of caspase-3 in leukaemia cells. CONCLUSION: Amifostine can differentially modulate DSBs and apoptosis induced by idarubicin in normal and cancer cells. It can protect normal cells against drug-induced DNA damage and it can potentate the action of the drug in leukaemic cells. Further studies on link between amifostine-induced modulation of DSBs and apoptosis of cancer cells will bring a deeper insight into molecular mechanism of amifostine action.","['Wozniak, K', 'Gloc, E', 'Morawiec, Z', 'Blasiak, J']","['Wozniak K', 'Gloc E', 'Morawiec Z', 'Blasiak J']","['Department of Molecular Genetics, University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Ukraine,Exp Oncol,Experimental oncology,101230541,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'M487QF2F4V (Amifostine)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Amifostine/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'DNA Breaks, Double-Stranded/*drug effects', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'DNA Repair/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Interactions', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/*pharmacology', 'K562 Cells', 'Lymphocytes/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Male', 'Models, Biological']",2008/04/29 09:00,2008/06/06 09:00,['2008/04/29 09:00'],"['2008/04/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/06 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/29 09:00 [entrez]']",['34/663 [pii]'],ppublish,Exp Oncol. 2008 Mar;30(1):22-8.,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Indeed, these efforts have led to a significant understanding that multiple genetic and molecular aberrations, such as increased proliferation and the inhibition of apoptosis, contribute to the canonical characteristics of cancer. Despite these advances in our knowledge, a more thorough understanding, such as the precise cells, which are the targets of neoplastic transformation, especially in solid tumors, is currently lacking. An emerging hypothesis in the field is that cancer arises and is sustained from a rare subpopulation of tumor cells with characteristics that are highly similar to stem cells, such as the ability to self-renew and differentiate. In addition, more recent studies indicate that stem cell self-renewal pathways that are active primarily during embryonic development and adult tissue repair may be aberrantly activated in various cancers. This chapter introduces the cancer stem cell hypothesis; explores evidence for the presence of cancer stem cells, particularly in leukemia; and discusses various classical stem cell self-renewal pathways in relation to cancer. Investigating the role of cancer stem cells in the context of the major characteristics of cancer, especially impaired apoptosis, offers great promise for the design of superior tumor-selective and apoptosis-inducing therapies.","['Jagani, Zainab', 'Khosravi-Far, Roya']","['Jagani Z', 'Khosravi-Far R']","['Novartis Institutes for Biomedical Research, Novartis Oncology, 250 Massachussetts Avenue, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA. zainab.jagani@novartis.com']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Adv Exp Med Biol,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,0121103,,IM,"['Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Humans', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*pathology']",2008/04/29 09:00,2008/05/14 09:00,['2008/04/29 09:00'],"['2008/04/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/14 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/29 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/978-1-4020-6554-5_15 [doi]'],ppublish,Adv Exp Med Biol. 2008;615:331-44. doi: 10.1007/978-1-4020-6554-5_15.,,102,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Resistance to GC may be involved in immune evasion of leukemia cells. The delivery of active grB into the cytoplasma is dependent on the presence of perforin (PFN) and grB complexes. We developed a rapid method for the isolation of GC to investigate GC-mediated cell death in primary leukemia cells. We isolated GC containing grB, grB complexes and PFN by detergent free hypotonic lysis of the human NK cell leukemia line YT. The GC induce grB-mediated, caspase-dependent apoptosis in live cells. The human leukemia cell lines KG-1, U937, K562 (myeloid leukemia), Jurkat, Daudi, and BV173 (lymphoblastic leukemia) treated with GC internalized grB and underwent cell death. In primary leukemia cells analyzed ex vivo, we found GC-resistant leukemia cells in three out of seven patients with acute myeloid leukemia and one out of six patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. We conclude that our method is fast (approximately 1 h) and yields active GC that induce grB-dependent cell death.

More recently, targeted therapies have been developed against some of the identified genetic lesions. These therapies have led to significant improvements in patient outcomes while simultaneously decreasing therapy-related toxicity. With the advent of genome-wide methods to define the total complement of genetic and epigenetic lesions involved in leukemogenesis, new targeted therapies can be anticipated.

Compared to the original regimen, the modified CALGB 19802 regimen consisted of a 4-drug induction (cyclophosphamide, daunorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone) instead of a 5-drug induction (L-asparaginase was added to the previous regimen). This was followed by high-dose methotrexate (1,000 mg/m(2) x 3 days) and cytarabine (2,000 mg/m(2) x 4 days) for the consolidation cycles. High-dose systemic and intrathecal methotrexate was given for central nervous system prophylaxis. Twenty-three patients (92%) achieved a complete remission (CR), and two patients (8%) had refractory disease. With a median follow-up of 21.5 months, 10 patients (40%) were alive and continued to be in CR. The 3-yr probability of an event-free survival and the overall survival were 39.0% and 47.4%, respectively. Treatment related mortality and major grade 3 to 4 neurotoxicity occurred in 1 patient and 3 patients, respectively. The modified CALGB 19802 regimen demonstrated a high remission rate and a favorable survival rate.","['Han, A-Reum', 'Kim, Kihyun', 'Jang, Jun Ho', 'Kim, Won Seog', 'Ahn, Jin Seok', 'Jung, Chul Won', 'Lee, Mark H', 'Kang, Won Ki']","['Han AR', 'Kim K', 'Jang JH', 'Kim WS', 'Ahn JS', 'Jung CW', 'Lee MH', 'Kang WK']","['Department of Medicine, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, 50 Irwon-dong, Gangnam-gu, Seoul, Korea.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],Korea (South),J Korean Med Sci,Journal of Korean medical science,8703518,"['5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Cyclophosphamide/*administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin/*administration & dosage', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Prednisone/*administration & dosage', 'Remission Induction', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vincristine/*administration & dosage']",2008/04/26 09:00,2008/08/05 09:00,['2008/04/26 09:00'],"['2008/04/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/05 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/26 09:00 [entrez]']","['200804278 [pii]', '10.3346/jkms.2008.23.2.278 [doi]']",ppublish,J Korean Med Sci. 2008 Apr;23(2):278-83. doi: 10.3346/jkms.2008.23.2.278.,2,,,,,PMC2526435,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, in this heterogeneous compartment, the precise role of TAL1, that is largely debated, remains to be clearly defined, notably at the common myeloid progenitor (CMP) and granulo-monocytic progenitor (GMP) levels. Using small hairpin (sh)RNA lentiviral constructs, we decreased TAL1 expression in sorted human CMP and GMP subpopulations that were then assayed for erythroid and granulo-monocytic (GM) differentiation. Decreased TAL1 expression in CMP resulted in rare erythroid colonies, in a 2-3 fold reduction of GM colony number in clonogenic assays and in a 3.6-5.6 decreased production of CD14(+)CD15(+) GM cells in liquid culture. Moreover, analysis of transcript profile of gene involved in GM differentiation showed that GM cells expressing shRNA-TAL1 construct displayed decreased levels of g-csfr, c/ebpalpha, and mpo and high levels of gata-2 transcripts, indicating a blocking of GM differentiation. In contrast, GM differentiation of GMP remained unaffected when TAL1 transcript levels were decreased. These data definitively delineate the human myeloid progenitors that are regulated by TAL1. Disclosure of potential conflicts of interest is found at the end of this article.","['Brunet de la Grange, Philippe', 'Zink, Estelle', 'Armstrong, Florence', 'Rouyez, Marie-Christine', 'Pflumio, Francoise']","['Brunet de la Grange P', 'Zink E', 'Armstrong F', 'Rouyez MC', 'Pflumio F']",,,['eng'],"['Letter', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Stem Cells,"Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)",9304532,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '135471-20-4 (TAL1 protein, human)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, CD34/analysis', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/*physiology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Separation', 'Fetal Blood/cytology', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Granulocytes/*cytology', 'Hematopoiesis/*physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology', 'Humans', 'Lentivirus/genetics', 'Monocytes/*cytology', 'Myeloid Progenitor Cells/*cytology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*physiology', 'RNA/genetics', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1']",2008/04/26 09:00,2008/08/07 09:00,['2008/04/26 09:00'],"['2008/04/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/07 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/26 09:00 [entrez]']","['2007-0952 [pii]', '10.1634/stemcells.2007-0952 [doi]']",ppublish,Stem Cells. 2008 Jun;26(6):1658-62. doi: 10.1634/stemcells.2007-0952.

ESCs represent the most promising source of all types of cells for regenerative medicine and drug discovery. These cells maintain pluripotency through a complex interplay of different signaling pathways and transcription factors including leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), homeodomain protein Nanog, and Oct3/4. Nanog, however, plays a key role in maintaining the pluripotency of mouse and human ESCs. Overexpression of nanog by heterologous promoters can maintain pluripotency of ESCs in the absence of LIF. Also, Nanog alone is sufficient for the self-renewal of ESCs while maintaining the Oct4 levels. Normally, mouse and human ESCs are cultured over mouse embryonic fibroblasts as feeders to maintain pluripotency. Although feeder cells provide important growth(-)promoting factors, their use involves several cumbersome and time-consuming steps. Here we demonstrate that retinol can support feeder-independent self-renewal of ESCs in long-term cultures without affecting their pluripotency. The effect of retinol is independent of the strain background, and the cells maintain complete potential to differentiate into all the primary germ layers in embryoid bodies and in chimeric animals. Self-renewal of ESCs by retinol is not mediated by retinoic acid. The studies demonstrate for the first time that a physiologically relevant small molecule has growth-promoting effect on the self-renewal of ESCs by activating the endogenous machinery to overexpress a critical gene for pluripotency.","['Chen, Liguo', 'Khillan, Jaspal S']","['Chen L', 'Khillan JS']","['Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, 200 Lothrop Street, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15213, USA.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Stem Cells,"Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)",9304532,"['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Nanog Homeobox Protein)', '0 (Nanog protein, mouse)', '0 (Octamer Transcription Factor-3)', '0 (Organic Cation Transport Proteins)', '0 (Pou5f1 protein, mouse)', '0 (solute carrier family 22 (organic cation transporter), member 3)', '11103-57-4 (Vitamin A)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Culture Techniques/methods', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Homeodomain Proteins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Nanog Homeobox Protein', 'Octamer Transcription Factor-3/metabolism', 'Organic Cation Transport Proteins/metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Vitamin A/*pharmacology']",2008/04/26 09:00,2008/11/19 09:00,['2008/04/26 09:00'],"['2008/04/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/11/19 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/26 09:00 [entrez]']","['2008-0050 [pii]', '10.1634/stemcells.2008-0050 [doi]']",ppublish,Stem Cells. 2008 Jul;26(7):1858-64. doi: 10.1634/stemcells.2008-0050.

We obtained unbiased, high-density, genome-wide measurements of subchromosomal copy number changes in highly purified DNA from sorted CD19(+) cells and buccal cells using the Affymetrix 50kXbaI SNP array platform (Santa Clara, CA). Genomic complexity scores were derived and correlated with the surrogate clinical end points time to first therapy (TTFT) and time to subsequent therapy (TTST): measures of disease aggressiveness and/or therapy efficaciousness. In univariate analysis, progressively increasing complexity scores in previously untreated CLL patients identified patients with short TTFT at high significance levels. Similarly, TTST was significantly shorter in pretreated patients with high as opposed to low genomic complexity. In multivariate analysis, genomic complexity emerged as an independent risk factor for short TTFT and TTST.

Understanding molecular mechanisms by which Nanog functions should illuminate fundamental properties of stem cells and the process of cellular reprogramming.

All CK22-positive cases, except for one mantle cell lymphoma, expressed the specific simple epithelial CK8 but not the basal/stratified epithelial CK5/6. Aberrant CK expression can be encountered in a small subset of otherwise characteristic B- and T-cell lymphomas, but not in acute leukemias, which should be considered in difficult differential diagnostic settings.","['Adams, Heiner', 'Schmid, Patrik', 'Dirnhofer, Stephan', 'Tzankov, Alexandar']","['Adams H', 'Schmid P', 'Dirnhofer S', 'Tzankov A']","['Institute for Pathology, University Hospital Basel, Schoenbeinstrasse 40, 4031 Basel, Switzerland.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",Germany,Pathol Res Pract,"Pathology, research and practice",7806109,['68238-35-7 (Keratins)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Europe', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Keratins/*analysis', 'Leukemia/*metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphoma/*chemistry/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Tissue Array Analysis']",2008/04/26 09:00,2008/09/26 09:00,['2008/04/26 09:00'],"['2007/11/12 00:00 [received]', '2008/01/10 00:00 [revised]', '2008/02/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/04/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/26 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/26 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0344-0338(08)00047-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.prp.2008.02.008 [doi]']",ppublish,Pathol Res Pract. 2008;204(8):569-73. doi: 10.1016/j.prp.2008.02.008.

METHODS: Genome-wide gene expression in lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) was determined using microarrays derived from five discordant and four concordant MZ twin pairs with idiopathic absence epilepsies and five unaffected MZ twin pairs. Gene expression was analyzed using three strategies: discordant MZ twins were compared as matched pairs, MZ twins concordant for epilepsy were compared to control MZ twins, and a singleton design of affected versus unaffected MZ twin individuals was used irrespective of twin pairing. An overlapping gene list was generated from these analyses. Dysregulation of genes recognized from the microarray experiment was validated using quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR) in the twin sample and in an independent sample of 18 sporadic absence cases and 24 healthy controls. RESULTS: Sixty-five probe sets were identified from the three combined microarray analysis strategies. Sixteen genes were chosen for validation and nine of these genes confirmed by qRT-PCR in the twin sample. Differential expression for EGR1 (an immediate early gene) and RCN2 (coding for the calcium-binding protein Reticulocalbin 2) were reconfirmed by qRT-PCR in the independent sample. DISCUSSION: Using a unique sample of discordant MZ twins, our study identified genes with altered expression, which suggests novel mechanisms in idiopathic absence epilepsy. Dysregulation of EGR1 and RCN2 is implicated in idiopathic absence epilepsy.","['Helbig, Ingo', 'Matigian, Nicholas A', 'Vadlamudi, Lata', 'Lawrence, Kate M', 'Bayly, Marta A', 'Bain, Sharon M', 'Diyagama, Dileepa', 'Scheffer, Ingrid E', 'Mulley, John C', 'Holloway, Andrew J', 'Dibbens, Leanne M', 'Berkovic, Samuel F', 'Hayward, Nicholas K']","['Helbig I', 'Matigian NA', 'Vadlamudi L', 'Lawrence KM', 'Bayly MA', 'Bain SM', 'Diyagama D', 'Scheffer IE', 'Mulley JC', 'Holloway AJ', 'Dibbens LM', 'Berkovic SF', 'Hayward NK']","['Department of Medicine, Epilepsy Research Centre, University of Melbourne, Austin Health, Australia.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Twin Study']",United States,Epilepsia,Epilepsia,2983306R,"['0 (Anticonvulsants)', '0 (Calcium-Binding Proteins)', '0 (EGR1 protein, human)', '0 (Early Growth Response Protein 1)', '0 (RCN2 protein, human)', '614OI1Z5WI (Valproic Acid)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Anticonvulsants/therapeutic use', 'Calcium-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor/pathology', 'Early Growth Response Protein 1/*genetics', 'Epilepsy, Absence/*diagnosis/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/methods', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/pathology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Twins, Monozygotic/*genetics', 'Valproic Acid/therapeutic use']",2008/04/26 09:00,2008/10/03 09:00,['2008/04/26 09:00'],"['2008/04/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/03 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/26 09:00 [entrez]']","['EPI1630 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1528-1167.2008.01630.x [doi]']",ppublish,Epilepsia. 2008 Sep;49(9):1546-54. doi: 10.1111/j.1528-1167.2008.01630.x.

This finding was confirmed by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction in 78 CLL and 12 nCD19(+) cases (P < .001).

Adult T-cell leukemia, which can result from infection with human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1), is associated with extensive genomic instability that has been attributed to the viral oncoprotein Tax. How Tax influences cellular responses to DNA damage to mediate genomic instability, however, remains unclear. Therefore, we investigated the effect of Tax on cellular pathways involved in recognition and repair of DNA double-strand breaks. Premature attenuation of ATM kinase activity and reduced association of MDC1 with repair foci were observed in Tax-expressing cells. Following ionizing radiation-induced S-phase checkpoint activation, Tax-expressing cells progressed more rapidly than non-Tax-expressing cells toward DNA replication. These results demonstrate that Tax expression may allow premature DNA replication in the presence of genomic lesions. Attempts to replicate in the presence of these lesions would result in gradual accumulation of mutations, leading to genome instability and cellular transformation.","['Chandhasin, Chandtip', 'Ducu, Razvan I', 'Berkovich, Elijahu', 'Kastan, Michael B', 'Marriott, Susan J']","['Chandhasin C', 'Ducu RI', 'Berkovich E', 'Kastan MB', 'Marriott SJ']","['Department of Molecular Virology and Microbiology, Baylor College of Medicine, One Baylor Plaza, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (MDC1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (tax protein, Human T-lymphotrophic virus 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (ATM protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Repair/*physiology', 'DNA Replication', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Gene Products, tax/*metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'T-Lymphocytes/radiation effects/virology', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors']",2008/04/25 09:00,2008/07/17 09:00,['2008/04/25 09:00'],"['2008/04/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['JVI.02331-07 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.02331-07 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2008 Jul;82(14):6952-61. doi: 10.1128/JVI.02331-07.

In humans, overexpression of A2 by acute promyelocytic leukemia cells is associated with excessive fibrinolysis and hemorrhage, whereas anti-A2 autoantibodies appear to accentuate the risk of thrombosis in patients with anti-phospholipid syndrome. Complete deficiency of A2 in mice leads to a lack of tPA cofactor activity, accumulation of intravascular fibrin, and failure to clear arterial thrombi. Within the endothelial cell, p11 is required for Src kinase-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of A2, which signals translocation of both proteins to the cell surface. Here we show that p11 is expressed at very low levels in the absence of A2 both in vitro and in vivo. We demonstrate further that unpartnered p11 becomes polyubiquitinated and degraded via a proteasome-dependent mechanism. A2 stabilizes intracellular p11 through direct binding, thus masking an autonomous p11 polyubiquitination signal that triggers proteasomal degradation. This interaction requires both the p11-binding N-terminal domain of A2 and the C-terminal domain of p11. This mechanism prevents accumulation of free p11 in the endothelial cell and suggests that regulation of tPA-dependent cell surface fibrinolytic activity is precisely tuned to the intracellular level of p11.","['He, Kai-Li', 'Deora, Arunkumar B', 'Xiong, Huabao', 'Ling, Qi', 'Weksler, Babette B', 'Niesvizky, Ruben', 'Hajjar, Katherine A']","['He KL', 'Deora AB', 'Xiong H', 'Ling Q', 'Weksler BB', 'Niesvizky R', 'Hajjar KA']","['Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, New York 10065, USA.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (ANXA2 protein, human)', '0 (Annexin A2)', '0 (Autoantibodies)', '0 (S100 Proteins)', '0 (S100 calcium binding protein A10)', '0 (Ubiquitin)', '9001-31-4 (Fibrin)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Oncogene Protein pp60(v-src))', 'EC 3.4.21.68 (Tissue Plasminogen Activator)', 'EC 3.4.21.7 (Fibrinolysin)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Annexin A2/genetics/*metabolism', 'Antiphospholipid Syndrome/blood/genetics', 'Autoantibodies/blood', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Endothelial Cells/*metabolism', 'Fibrin/genetics/metabolism', 'Fibrinolysin/genetics/metabolism', 'Fibrinolysis/genetics', 'Hemorrhage/blood/etiology/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/blood/complications/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Oncogene Protein pp60(v-src)/genetics/metabolism', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Binding/genetics', 'Protein Transport/genetics', 'S100 Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Thrombosis/blood/etiology', 'Tissue Plasminogen Activator/genetics/metabolism', 'Ubiquitin/genetics/metabolism', '*Ubiquitination/genetics']",2008/04/25 09:00,2008/08/30 09:00,['2008/04/25 09:00'],"['2008/04/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/30 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(20)81372-6 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M800100200 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2008 Jul 11;283(28):19192-200. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M800100200.

Caspase-independent programmed cell death with necrotic morphology. Cell Death and Differentiation 6, 508-515]. However, not all synthetic caspase inhibitors diminish cell death. We have found that the broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor Boc-Asp-CMK induced cell death at micromolar concentrations in human leukaemia cells. Interestingly, low concentrations of Boc-Asp-CMK induced cell death with apoptotic hallmarks. Increasing concentrations of Boc-Asp-CMK led to necrotic cell death. The switch between apoptosis and necrosis seemed to depend upon the degree of inhibition of executioner caspases, including caspase-3/7 with Boc-Asp-CMK. Interestingly, caspase-3 processing was not inhibited even for the highest concentration of Boc-Asp-CMK used. We assume, that toxic properties of Boc-Asp-CMK can be attributed to the chloromethylketone residuum in its molecule, as its analogue Boc-Asp-FMK with fluoromethylketone residuum was more than 13 times less toxic. Our results further indicated that toxicity of Boc-Asp-CMK might arise from its interference with mitochondrial metabolism.","['Frydrych, Ivo', 'Mlejnek, Petr', 'Dolezel, Petr', 'Zoumpourlis, Vassilis', 'Krumpochova, Petra']","['Frydrych I', 'Mlejnek P', 'Dolezel P', 'Zoumpourlis V', 'Krumpochova P']","['Department of Biology, Faculty of Medicine, Palacky University, Hnevotinska 3, Olomouc 77515, Czech Republic.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Toxicol In Vitro,Toxicology in vitro : an international journal published in association with BIBRA,8712158,"['0 (Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones)', '0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (N-tert-butyloxycarbonyl-aspartyl (benzyl)chloromethylketone)', '0 (butyloxycarbonyl-aspartyl-fluoromethyl ketone)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', '*Caspase Inhibitors', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Oxygen Consumption/drug effects', 'U937 Cells/enzymology/pathology']",2008/04/25 09:00,2008/08/30 09:00,['2008/04/25 09:00'],"['2007/10/30 00:00 [received]', '2008/02/16 00:00 [revised]', '2008/02/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/04/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/30 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0887-2333(08)00068-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.tiv.2008.02.017 [doi]']",ppublish,Toxicol In Vitro. 2008 Aug;22(5):1356-60. doi: 10.1016/j.tiv.2008.02.017.

Much has been learned about the underlying immunologic, cytogenetic and molecular features of AML in recent years, and many features have been identified that portend a poor prognosis for elderly patients with newly diagnosed AML. Despite this, treatment outcomes for elderly patients remain poor for both newly diagnosed and relapsed disease. While conventional treatment approaches may be appropriate for some elderly patients, the vast majority do not tolerate intensive chemotherapy well, thus alternative strategies have been investigated. Here we review both conventional and novel treatment approaches for elderly patients with AML, including agents in early clinical trials. Treatment options have been divided into several discussions, including conventional treatments, agents complementary to conventional treatments, alternatives to conventional induction therapies, post-induction treatment, and relapsed disease. Current and developing research focuses upon identifying subgroups of patients that benefit more from specific chemotherapeutic agents. Treating elderly patients with AML requires an organized, multidisciplinary approach, taking into account individual patient characteristics, preferences, and comorbidities when formulating treatment plans.","['Craig, Chad M', 'Schiller, Gary J']","['Craig CM', 'Schiller GJ']","['Department of Medicine, David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California at Los Angeles, CA, United States. ccraig@mednet.ucla.edu']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Blood Rev,Blood reviews,8708558,"['0 (Adenine Nucleotides)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arabinonucleosides)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Hydrazines)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '14J2G0U3NQ (laromustine)', '762RDY0Y2H (Clofarabine)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)']",IM,"['Adenine Nucleotides/therapeutic use', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Arabinonucleosides/therapeutic use', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/therapeutic use', 'Azacitidine/therapeutic use', 'Clofarabine', 'Cytarabine/therapeutic use', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Hydrazines/therapeutic use', 'Idarubicin/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Oxides/therapeutic use', 'Recurrence', 'Sulfonamides/therapeutic use']",2008/04/25 09:00,2008/08/30 09:00,['2008/04/25 09:00'],"['2008/04/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/30 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0268-960X(08)00022-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.blre.2008.03.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Rev. 2008 Jul;22(4):221-34. doi: 10.1016/j.blre.2008.03.002.

METHODS: We identified 42,722 1-year survivors of testicular cancer within 14 population-based cancer registries in Europe and North America (1943-2002). Poisson regression analysis was used to model EAR (per 100,000 person-years [PY]) and ERR of secondary leukemia. Cumulative risks were calculated using a competing risk model. RESULTS: Secondary leukemia developed in 89 patients (EAR = 10.8 per 100,000 PY, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 7.6-14.6; ERR = 1.6, 95%CI = 1.0-2.2). Statistically significantly elevated risks were observed for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (EAR = 7.2, 95%CI = 4.7-10.2) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (EAR = 1.3, 95%CI = 0.4-2.8). In multivariate analyses, AML risk was higher among patients whose initial management included chemotherapy compared to those receiving radiotherapy alone (p = 0.1). Excess cumulative leukemia risk was approximately 0.23% by 30 years after testicular cancer diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Although ERR of leukemia following testicular cancer is large, EAR and cumulative risk, which are better gauges of the population burden, are small.","['Howard, Regan', 'Gilbert, Ethel', 'Lynch, Charles F', 'Hall, Per', 'Storm, Hans', 'Holowaty, Eric', 'Pukkala, Eero', 'Langmark, Froydis', 'Kaijser, Magnus', 'Andersson, Michael', 'Joensuu, Heikki', 'Fossa, Sophie D', 'Allan, James M', 'Travis, Lois B']","['Howard R', 'Gilbert E', 'Lynch CF', 'Hall P', 'Storm H', 'Holowaty E', 'Pukkala E', 'Langmark F', 'Kaijser M', 'Andersson M', 'Joensuu H', 'Fossa SD', 'Allan JM', 'Travis LB']","['Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Department of Health and Human Services, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA. reganho@mail.nih.gov']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Ann Epidemiol,Annals of epidemiology,9100013,,IM,"['Adult', 'Cohort Studies', 'Europe/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*epidemiology', 'North America/epidemiology', 'Registries', 'Testicular Neoplasms/*epidemiology/therapy']",2008/04/25 09:00,2008/06/20 09:00,['2008/04/25 09:00'],"['2007/11/02 00:00 [received]', '2008/01/14 00:00 [revised]', '2008/01/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/04/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1047-2797(08)00026-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.annepidem.2008.01.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Epidemiol. 2008 May;18(5):416-21. doi: 10.1016/j.annepidem.2008.01.003.,5,,,['ZIA CP010131-18/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],,PMC4034178,['NIHMS557654'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this unit, we describe the protocols used for the isolation and/or culture of these cells and discuss the relative merits of their use.","['Jensen, Bettina M', 'Swindle, Emily J', 'Iwaki, Shoko', 'Gilfillan, Alasdair M']","['Jensen BM', 'Swindle EJ', 'Iwaki S', 'Gilfillan AM']","['National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",United States,Curr Protoc Immunol,Current protocols in immunology,9101651,"['0 (Receptors, IgE)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Culture Techniques/*methods', '*Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Separation/*methods', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Flow Cytometry/methods', 'Mast Cells/immunology/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Rats', 'Receptors, IgE/immunology/physiology']",2008/04/25 09:00,2008/07/09 09:00,['2008/04/25 09:00'],"['2008/04/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/09 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/25 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/0471142735.im0323s74 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Protoc Immunol. 2006 Sep;Chapter 3:Unit 3.23. doi: 10.1002/0471142735.im0323s74.,,,,"['ZIA AI000965-04/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'Intramural NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus, although M-O7e cells can readily be used to quantitate levels of IL-9 in the absence of other cytokines, analysis in the presence of complex mixtures of cytokines (e.g., natural sources) requires the use of specific antibodies against IL-9 and the other cytokines, as described in this unit.","['Renauld, Jean-Christophe', 'Van Snick, Jacques']","['Renauld JC', 'Van Snick J']","['Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research and Experimental Medicine Unit, Catholic University of Louvain, Brussels, Belgium.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Curr Protoc Immunol,Current protocols in immunology,9101651,['0 (Interleukin-9)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-9/*analysis', 'Mice']",2008/04/25 09:00,2008/05/17 09:00,['2008/04/25 09:00'],"['2008/04/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/25 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/0471142735.im0613s51 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Protoc Immunol. 2002 Nov;Chapter 6:Unit 6.13. doi: 10.1002/0471142735.im0613s51.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the first, human or rodent SCF is measured by its ability to stimulate proliferation of the human megakaryoblastic leukemia cell line, UT-7. Because rat and mouse SCF bind well to human c-kit, human and rodent SCF can both be measured using the first basic protocol. In an Alternate Protocol, rodent SCF is assayed by its ability to stimulate proliferation of the clonal murine mast cell line, MC/9. Human SCF is not very active on rodent cells and thus cannot be measured using this protocol. Both of the cell proliferation assays lack specificity because they are capable of detecting other cytokines in addition to SCF. The third protocol is a radioreceptor assay using the human erythroleukemia cell line, OCIM1; it specifically measures murine or human SCF and not other cytokines.

However, the benefit/risk ratio of this invasive procedure is probably lower in the subset of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The study was to analyze the yield of BAL performed in HM patients (n=175) with AML or lymphoid malignancies (LM) admitted in intensive care unit (ICU) for ARF and pulmonary infiltrates. BAL was performed in 121 patients (53/73 AML patients (73%) and 68/102 LM patients (67%)) without a definite diagnosis at admission or contraindication for fiberoptic bronchoscopy. Life-threatening complications were noticed in 12/121 patients (10%). The overall diagnostic yield of BAL was 47% (25/53) in AML patients and 50% (34/68) in LM patients. A microorganism was recovered from BAL in 23% (12/53) of AML patients and 41% (28/68) of LM patients (P<0.005). BAL results induced significant therapeutic changes in 17% (9/53) of AML patients vs 35% (24/68) of LM patients (P=0.039). This study underlines the rather low diagnostic yield of BAL for infectious diagnosis and the low rate of therapeutic changes induced by its results in AML patients with ARF admitted in ICU.","['Rabbat, A', 'Chaoui, D', 'Lefebvre, A', 'Roche, N', 'Legrand, O', 'Lorut, C', 'Rio, B', 'Marie, J-P', 'Huchon, G']","['Rabbat A', 'Chaoui D', 'Lefebvre A', 'Roche N', 'Legrand O', 'Lorut C', 'Rio B', 'Marie JP', 'Huchon G']","['Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, Hotel-Dieu Hospital, AP-HP, Universite Paris Descartes, Paris, France. antoine.rabbat@htd.aphp.fr']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Bronchoalveolar Lavage/adverse effects/*methods', 'Bronchoscopy/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Intensive Care Units', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*complications', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pneumonia/*diagnosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Respiratory Insufficiency/*diagnosis/mortality']",2008/04/25 09:00,2008/08/30 09:00,['2008/04/25 09:00'],"['2008/04/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/30 09:00 [medline]', '2008/04/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['leu2008100 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2008.100 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2008 Jul;22(7):1361-7. doi: 10.1038/leu.2008.100.

The starting dose of V was 1.0 mg/m(2) (days 1, 4, 8, 11, every 21 day) with T added from cycle 2 at 50 mg/day, with 50 mg increments per 10 patient cohorts, to a maximum dose of 200 mg. In the absence of DLT's, the same reiteration of T dose increases was applied with a higher dose of V=1.3 mg/m(2). D was added with cycle 4 in the absence of partial response (PR). Ninety-two percent had prior autotransplants, 74% had prior T and 76% abnormal cytogenetics. MTD was reached at V=1.3 mg/m(2) and T=150 mg. Minor response (MR) was recorded in 79%, and 63% achieved PR including 22% who qualified for near-complete remission. At 4 years, 6% remain event-free and 23% alive. Both OS and EFS were significantly longer in the absence of prior T exposure and when at least MR status was attained.
