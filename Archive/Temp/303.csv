ATLL rarely is described outside of endemic regions, which include southwestern Japan, the Caribbean region, and the southeastern United States. The authors report the clinical, pathologic, and immunologic features of two cases of nonendemic ATLL that occurred in patients from the midwest United States. One patient was a 16-year-old white girl from rural Iowa, and the other was a 46-year-old white man from rural Minnesota. The features of 13 other probable nonendemic ATLL cases from the United States were compiled and reviewed. In the United States, nonendemic ATLL occurred in widespread geographic locations, affected mostly white people, and was characterized by an aggressive course with generalized adenopathy, blood and bone marrow involvement, and hepatosplenomegaly at presentation. Skin involvement was present in one-fourth of the patients. Hypercalcemia was rare. Although antibodies to type C retrovirus were detected in three of the five patients tested, the available data is not sufficient to establish a conclusive association between nonendemic ATLL and type C retrovirus infection.",,,,,,,,,

This was in contrast to virus-induced leukemias, which routinely exhibited several new proviral integration sites. When an internal proviral DNA restriction fragment was monitored, some radiation leukemias showed evidence of nonclonal infection, accounting for more frequent isolation of infectious virus from such leukemias. Differences in expression of T-cell surface antigens were found in X-ray-induced and virus-induced leukemias. All radiation leukemias were TL positive, whereas virus-induced leukemias were primarily negative for TL. Some differences were also found in Lyt-1 and Lyt-2 expression.

By virtue of its N-tropism, the virus replicates well in tissues of mice bearing the n but not the b allele at the Fv-1 locus. To determine if different Fv-1n strains of mice were equally susceptible to virus-induced neurological disease, we inoculated NFS, C3H, DBA/2, CBA, AKR, C58, and NZB mice at birth with Cas-Br-M murine leukemia virus and observed them for the development of tremor and hind-limb paralysis. Three patterns of disease were observed: NFS and C3H mice developed disease within 3 months postinoculation; DBA/2 and CBA mice became affected between 8 and 15 months postinoculation; and no disease was observed in AKR, C58, or NZB mice up to 15 months after infection with Cas-Br-M murine leukemia virus. Studies of genetic crosses between intermediate-latency (DBA/2) or long-latency (AKR) strains with short-latency (NFS) strains showed that intermediate latency and long latency were semidominant traits determined by two or more interacting but independently assorting loci.

In indirect immunofluorescence assays, the antigen was detected on the surface of both HTLV-transformed producer and nonproducer cells, including cells infected in vitro with either HTLV subgroup I (HTLV-I) or HTLV-II. Normal human peripheral blood lymphocytes stimulated with phytohemagglutinin, cord blood T cells cultured with T-cell growth factor, and a variety of HTLV-negative T- and B-cell lines all lacked HT462 antigen expression. The HT462 antigen is a 52,000-molecular-weight glycoprotein, as shown by Western blotting procedures and treatment of viral preparations with neuraminidase, endoglycosidase F, and trypsin. The unglycosylated molecule is approximately 42,000 daltons. That the antigen is virus associated was demonstrated by its banding at the density of HTLV in gradients of metrizamide and by its concomitant synthesis with HTLV gag proteins after short-term culture of primary HTLV-positive leukemic cells. Differential expression of the HT462 antigen and HTLV gag-pol gene products was observed. In one case, low HT462 expression was correlated with the known inability of the particular cell line to produce syncytia in vitro. The properties of the HT462 antigen are most consistent with it being a gene product of the HTLV px region or else a cellular antigen specifically induced after viral infection. We cannot rule out, however, that the antigen is a variant cleavage product of the env gene. The monoclonal HT462 will be useful in further definition of the proteins and functions encoded by the env-px genetic sequence and in studying the biological properties of HTLV-transformed cells.

Quant. Biol. 44:1269-1274, 1979; Lung et al., J. Virol. 45:275-290, 1983). We used a set of recombinants constructed in vitro from molecular clones of leukemogenic MCF 247 and nonleukemogenic ecotropic Akv to separate and thereby directly test the role of these genetic elements in disease induction. Leukemogenicity tests of recombinants in AKR mice show that introduction of fragments containing either an MCF LTR or MCF gp70 coding sequences can confer only a very low incidence of disease induction on Akv virus, whereas an MCF type Prp15E alone is completely ineffective. Recombinants with an MCF 247 LTR in combination with MCF Prp15E are moderately oncogenic, whereas those with an MCF 247 LTR plus MCF gp70 coding segment are quite highly leukemogenic. Mice infected with the latter virus show a substantial increase in latent period of disease induction relative to MCF 247; this delay can be reduced when Prp15E, and hence the entire 3' half of the genome, is from MCF 247. Surprisingly, sequences in the 5' half of the genome can also contribute to disease induction. We found a good correlation between oncogenicity and recovery of MCF viruses from thymocytes of injected mice, with early recovery and high titers of MCF in the thymus being correlated with high oncogenicity. This correlation held for recombinants with either an MCF or ecotropic type gp70. Together, these results (i) demonstrate that at least four genes contribute to the oncogenicity of MCF viruses in AKR mice and (ii) suggest that recombinants with only some of the necessary MCF type genes induce leukemia because they recombine to generate complete MCF genomes. Although neither Akv nor MCF 247 is leukemogenic in NFS mice, recombinant viruses whose gp70 gene was derived from Akv but whose LTRs were derived from MCF 247 induced a low incidence of leukemia in this mouse strain.","['CA19308/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA26717/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P0I-CA19308/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (DNA, Recombinant)', 'EC 3.1.21.- (DNA Restriction Enzymes)']",,PMC254998,,,,,

Nucleotide sequences encoding portions of gp70, Prp15E, and the long terminal repeat differ between the two types of viruses. To investigate the role of each of these genetic elements in determining the biological properties of MCF viruses, we prepared infectious molecular clones of MCF 247 and generated a set of recombinants between these clones and a molecular clone of Akv, the ecotropic parent of MCF 247. Each molecular clone of MCF 247 was distinct. All the recombinants between Akv and MCF 247 yielded infectious virus upon transfection. Most interestingly, recombinants which contain the long terminal repeat of MCF 247 were found to have an in vitro host range property that has been correlated with high oncogenic activity and thymotropism of certain MCF isolates; namely, they plated with higher efficiency on SC-1 cells than on NFS mouse embryo cells.

Examination of the steady-state level of histone H3 mRNA by molecular hybridization of total RNA to a cloned mouse histone H3 complementary DNA probe demonstrated that the ratio of histone H3 mRNA to total RNA remained unchanged for the first 4 h postinfection. In contrast, the steady-state levels of globin and actin mRNAs decreased progressively at early intervals postinfection.

The early stages of this process are difficult to study because of the lack of sensitive and specific markers of clonal evolution in an experimental system. We have developed a cat model using cellular mosaicism for glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6-PD). Our findings confirm that the structural locus for feline G-6-PD is on the X-chromosome and demonstrate that it is randomly inactivated in somatic cells. Heterozygous cats have balanced ratios of G-6-PD enzyme types in peripheral blood cells and hematopoietic progenitors that remain stable over time. In our initial studies, we used the model to analyze the events surrounding marrow failure experimentally induced by selected strains of feline leukemia virus (FeLV). Two G-6-PD heterozygous cats, one F1 male hybrid and one domestic cat were infected with FeLV (C or KT) and developed pure red cell aplasia (PRCA). Colonies arising from the more mature erythroid colony-forming cell were not detected in marrow culture of anemic animals although erythroid bursts persisted, suggesting that the differentiation of early erythroid progenitors (BFU-E) was inhibited in vivo. The ratio of G-6-PD types in hematopoietic progenitors and peripheral blood cells from the heterozygous cats did not change when the animals developed PRCA. Thus, the anemia did not result from the clonal expansion of a transformed myeloid stem cell. With this experimental approach, one may prospectively assess clonal evolution and cellular interactions in other FeLV-induced diseases.","['AM19410/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States', 'AM23130/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States', 'GM15253/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",['EC 1.1.1.49 (Glucosephosphate Dehydrogenase)'],,PMC423418,,,,,

Previous experiments have shown that interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) is responsible for some but not all of the differentiation-inducing effects on U937. To determine the variety and specificity of activity, the following factors were studied: phytohemagglutinin-induced LK that contained IFN-gamma (100 units/ml); purified IFN-gamma; human colony-stimulating factor 1 (CSF-1); and conditioned medium(a) (CM) from the human bladder carcinoma cell line 5637 and the hepatoma cell line SK-HEP. LK preparations contained no colony-stimulating activity, whereas CM from 5637 and SK-HEP both contained granulocyte-macrophage CSF (3000 to 4000 units/ml) but no IFN activity. IFN-gamma is the major immunoglobulin G Fc receptor-inducing species within lymphokine, since anti-interferon-gamma antibody inhibited most of this activity. Other sources of Fc receptor-inducing activity were CM from SK-HEP and 5637 cell lines. Human CSF-1 when tested up to 800 units/ml was inactive for Fc receptor induction. LK induced the chemotactic peptide receptor, but this induction was due to factors other than IFN-gamma as anti-IFN-gamma antibody did not inhibit the induction, and purified IFN-gamma at a dose equivalent to that found in LK (100 units/ml) had no activity in the assay. SK-HEP and 5637 CM had strong chemotactic peptide receptor-inducing activity, but human CSF-1 was inactive up to 800 units/ml. Peroxide production after stimulation with phorbol myristic acid could be induced by LK, LK with anti-IFN-gamma antibody, 5637, and SK-HEP treatment. IFN-gamma (100 units/ml) and CSF-1 (800 units/ml) were ineffective. Peroxide production was induced by IFN-gamma at concentrations above 1000 units/ml. The inducibility of several enzymatic activities was determined as additional measures of maturation. N-Acetylglucuronidase was induced, for example, by LK, IFN-gamma, 5637 CM, and phorbol myristic acid. Alkaline phosphatase was induced by LK, IFN-gamma, dexamethasone, and phorbol myristic acid. 1,25-Dihydroxycholecalciferol was also examined and could induce most of the maturational markers examined.

Immunoprecipitation of solubilized 125I-labeled membrane proteins from SJ-N-CG cells with J-5 antibody revealed a protein with a molecular weight of 100,000 as determined on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Morphological differentiation of SJ-N-CG cells could be induced in the presence of 2.0 mM dibutyryl adenosine 3'-5'-cyclic monophosphoric acid for 10 days of culture. Changes in cell surface membrane antigens associated with morphological differentiation were studied by indirect immunofluorescence and complement-dependent cytotoxicity using a panel of seven monoclonal antibodies. Increases in the antigens recognized by BA-2 (detecting leukemia-associated antigen), anti-Thy-1, and antibody 390 (Thy-1 antigen) were found in ""differentiated cells,"" while those detected by BA-1 (B-cell-associated antigen) and J-5 (CALLA) were unchanged. In contrast, the antitransferrin receptor defined by B3/25 was inhibited, and expression of B7/21-defined la-like antigen was not induced. Kinetic studies on antigenic alterations showed that the expression of BA-2-defined antigen rose on Day 2 and remained at the same level until Day 10. The expression of CALLA was not changed from Days 2 to 10. The augmentation of Thy-1 antigen was noted on Day 4 and reached the maximum on Day 10. These results show that dibutyryl adenosine 3'-5'-cyclic monophosphoric acid is capable of inducing phenotypic changes in SJ-N-CG cells. The changes of expression of some antigens on exposure of cells to dibutyryl adenosine 3'-5'-cyclic monophosphoric acid may enable us to have a greater understanding of the differentiation of neuroblastoma to a more mature ganglioneuroblastoma phenotype.",,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '63X7MBT2LQ (Bucladesine)', '9007-36-7 (Complement System Proteins)', 'EC 3.4.24.11 (Neprilysin)']",,,,,,,

These findings contrast with the few previously reported cases of adult T-cell lymphoma with hypercalcemia, which showed lytic, sclerotic, or osteoporotic bone lesions. The authors suggest that the patient's malignant T-lymphocytes may have produced an osteoclast-activating-factor-like substance or a parathormone-like substance, which caused the striking bone changes.

They are frequently located in the left atrium and produce symptoms when they fragment and cause systemic emboli or when they interfere with cardiac valvular function and cause pulmonary congestion. Careful surgical management of these lesions should be curative with minimum early and late morbidity and mortality. Optimal operative technique emphasizes minimal manipulation of the heart before institution of cardiopulmonary bypass and aortic cross-clamping and careful examination of intracardiac chambers with meticulous removal of myxomatous debris. Using these techniques, 17 patients have been treated successfully at the Brigham and Women's Hospital. There were no operative deaths and no significant perioperative morbidity.

Thymic lymphocytes, instead, do not exhibit changes in Thy expression upon CHS treatment although cell membranes become rigidified.

The chemosensitivities of each P388 line to assorted anticancer drugs were compared in vivo. Both P388/MMC and P388/MMC-NP had similar patterns of drug cross-resistance and collateral sensitivity. With respect to alkylating agents (e.g. cyclophosphamide, Platinol and chlorambucil), there was generally a partial degree of cross-resistance, sometimes only detectable at suboptimal dose levels. With respect to DNA binders or intercalators (e.g. actinomycin D, luzopeptin A, amsacrine, doxorubicin), the extent of cross-resistance varied from none (dihydoxyanthraquinone) to marked (doxorubicin).

The P(1,4)B antibiotics are potent antitumor agents produced by various Actinomycetes, which are believed to mediate their cytotoxic effects by covalent bonding through N-2 of guanine in the minor groove of DNA. In this article we describe the results of a sensitive DNA alkylation assay using exonuclease III which permits both estimation of the extent of DNA modification as well as location of the precise guanines to which the drugs are covalently bound. Using this assay, we have evaluated a series of natural and synthetic compounds of the P(1,4)B class for their ability to bind to DNA and also determined their DNA sequence preference. The compounds included in this study are P(1,4)Bs carrying different substituents in the aromatic ring, having varying degrees of saturation in the five-membered ring, or differing in the stereochemistry at C-11a. These same compounds were evaluated for in vitro cytotoxic activity against B16 melanoma cells, for potency in vivo in B6D2F1 mice (LD50), and for antitumor activity (ILSmax) against P388 leukemia cells. A good correlation was found between extent of DNA alkylation and in vitro and in vivo potency. Furthermore, on the basis of electronic and steric considerations, it was possible to rationalize why those compounds that showed negligible biological activity were unable to bond covalently to DNA. Last, we have determined that the degree of saturation in the five-membered ring of the P(1,4)Bs has a significant effect on the DNA bonding reactivity and biological activity of this class of compounds.",['CA-35318/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Pyrroles)', '12794-10-4 (Benzodiazepines)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",,,"['Drug Dynamics Institute, College of Pharmacy, University of Texas, Austin 78712.']",,,,

The p55 chain of the interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2R/p55) recognized by anti-Tac monoclonal antibody (mAb) is expressed on activated T and B cells as well as natural killer (NK) cells. IL-2R/p55(Tac) is constitutively expressed on T4(+) T cells transformed by human T-lymphotropic virus I (HTLV-I), which is a causative agent for adult T-cell leukemia (ATL). Low affinity Fc receptor for IgE (Fc epsilon R2/CD23) is another inducible receptor binding IgE and is expressed on various hematopoietic cell types. While the physiological expression of Fc epsilon R2 and its soluble form (IgE Binding Factor; IgE BF) is variably regulated by cytokines and IgE, there is a constitutive expression of Fc epsilon R2 on Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) transformed B cell lines and some of HTLV-I (+) T cell lines. ATL-derived factor (ADF) has been characterized as an IL-2R/p55(Tac) inducing factor derived from HTLV-I(+) T cell lines. Purification of ADF protein and the cDNA cloning proved that ADF is closely related to the autocrine growth factor produced by an EBV(+) B cell line 3B6 (H. Wakasugi and T. Tursz) and belonging to the family of thiol reducing co-enzyme thioredoxin which is involved in many biological reactions.

The mononuclear phagocyte colony-stimulating factor (CSF-1 or M-CSF) is a polypeptide growth factor synthesized by mesenchymal cells, which stimulates the survival, proliferation, and differentiation of haematopoietic cells of the monocyte-macrophage series. Multiple forms of soluble CSF-1 are produced by proteolytic cleavage of membrane-bound precursors, some of which are stably expressed at the cell surface. The c-fms proto-oncogene encodes the CSF-1 receptor, which is composed of an extracellular ligand-binding domain linked by a single membrane-spanning segment to a cytoplasmic tyrosine-specific protein kinase domain. Whereas the tyrosine kinase activity of the normal receptor is stimulated by CSF-1, mutations in the c-fms gene can constitutively activate the kinase to provide growth-stimulatory signals in the absence of the ligand. Oncogenic activation of the c-fms gene product appears to involve removal of a negative regulatory tyrosine residue near the carboxyl terminus of the receptor and one or more additional mutations that may simulate a conformational change induced by CSF-1 binding. Expression of the human c-fms gene in mouse NIH-3T3 cells confers a CSF-1 stimulated growth phenotype, indicating that receptor transduction is sufficient for fibroblasts to respond to a haematopoietic growth factor. In contrast, the v-fms oncogene induces factor-independent growth and tumorigenicity in factor-dependent myeloid cell lines, and contributes to the development of proliferative disorders of multiple haematopoietic lineages when introduced into murine bone marrow progenitors. Aberrant expression of an endogenous c-fms gene secondary to proviral insertion and transcriptional activation has also been implicated in virus-induced myeloblastic leukaemia in mice. The c-fms and CSF-1 genes have been mapped on the long arm of human chromosome 5, a region that frequently undergoes interstitial deletions in certain haematopoietic disorders including acute myelogenous leukaemia. The study of CSF-1 and its receptor should provide information concerning the role of tyrosine kinases in regulating the normal growth and differentiation of haematopoietic cells and in contributing to their malignant transformation.","['CA20180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA38187/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '81627-83-0 (Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",,,"[""Department of Tumor Cell Biology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee 38105.""]",,,,

In contrast, the same antigen is transiently expressed by normal T-cells only after immune stimulation. Recently, it was reported that the constitutively expressed Tac antigen on ATL cells and cell lines was not down-regulated or modulated by anti-Tac antibody. Since the antigen was modulated on normal mitogen- or alloantigen-stimulated T-cells, we postulated that the regulation of IL-2-R may be abnormal on ATL cells; the synthesis of IL-2-R is continuously stimulated in these cells. A unique HTLV/ATLV(-) cell line (YT) derived from a child with acute lymphoblastic leukemia was found to express low levels of Tac antigen that could be enhanced by various stimuli, including conditioned medium (CM) derived from normal lymphocytes, but not by lectins (PHA, Con A). Of particular interest, the exposure of YT cells to CM from ATL cell lines with helper phenotype revealed the presence of factor(s) (ATL-derived factor, ADF) that augmented the synthesis and expression of IL-2-R/Tac antigen on YT cells and promoted YT cell growth. CM from HTLV(-) leukemia cell lines lacked both IL-2-R augmenting activity and a growth promoting activity. Immunoaffinity-purified IL-2 and recombinant gamma interferon also lacked IL-2-R augmenting activity. Moreover, the physicochemical analysis with Fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) revealed that ADF was quite different in pI point from the IL-2-R augmenting activity in CM from normal lymphocytes. These results suggested that ADF is a unique product of HTLV(+) cells. The possible relationship between ADF production, HTLV infection, and the abnormal expression of IL-2-R is suggested, and these abnormalities may be advantageous for the leukemogenesis and abnormal growth of ATL.",,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)']",,,"['Institute for Immunology, Faculty of Medicine, Kyoto University, Japan.']",,,,

All hairy cells tested were relatively insensitive to cytolysis by PBMC and IFN alpha activated PBMC. The low levels of 51Cr release obtained with a few donors was due to lysis of leukemic cells, not residual normal cells, and was mediated by a natural killer cell (T cell receptor independent) mechanism.

Proliferative responses of lymphocytes to autologous and allogeneic stimulator cells [autologous mixed lymphocyte response (AMLR) and mixed lymphocyte response (MLR), respectively] and to mitogens were tested both prior to and around the usual age of disease onset which occurs at 7-8 months. Leukemia in these animals was defined by elevated peripheral blood and splenic white blood cell counts. The AMLR declined greater than 30% by 6-7 months of age and was virtually absent by 8 months of age even in animals that were not overtly leukemic. The MLR declined precipitously (greater than 95%) at 9 months of age. Both declines occurred at a younger age in C58 mice than in nonleukemic strains. Mixing experiments with cells from young and old animals indicate a defect in the Ly 1+23-, L3T4+ responding T cells. No evidence indicating a role for suppressor cell activity in this decline of cell-mediated immunity could be found. Deficiencies in cytokine (IL-2 and IL-1) production were not observed except in the oldest mice tested. Around the usual time of disease onset, splenic natural killer (NK) cell activity declines sharply even in nonleukemic mice. Cell-mixing experiments showed no evidence of suppressor cell activity by spleen cells from older mice, leukemic or nonleukemic, on the NK cell activity of young adult animals. Interferon alpha, beta treatment enhanced the NK activity of cells from old mice but did not restore the level of activity seen in young mice.

We performed uni- and multivariate statistical analyses on a series of 37 patients receiving a non-depleted allogeneic bone marrow transplant from an HLA-identical sibling donor for a haematological malignancy, in order to identify risk factors for GvHD. Three factors were associated with development of moderate to severe GvHD: a positive mixed epidermal cell-lymphocyte reaction (MECLR) between donor and recipient, previous pregnancies in female donors and chronic myeloid leukaemia diagnosis. The MECLR was the most important predictive factor, selected in first rank by the stepwise linear discriminant analysis. Combining these three prognostic factors in the jackknifed procedure, we could correctly classify 33/37 patients in two groups: grade O-I versus grade II-IV acute GvHD.

The first potentiates a selected effector arm. In vitro culture with exogenous interleukin-2 (IL-2) increases the activity of natural killer cells and leads to the expansion of T cytotoxic lymphocytes. Systemic reinfusion of both of these cells with high doses of IL-2 mediates the regression of a variety of murine and human tumors. In an alternative strategy, a few regulatory lymphocytes turn on immune reactivity by triggering a cascade of interconnected effector functions. The efficacy of this strategy rests on the repertoire of effector mechanisms moved to action. An effective immunoregulatory maneuver is the addition of helper determinants on the surface of tumor cells. Its power can be further increased by the pre-induction of helper T lymphocytes specific to the helper determinants. This approach can be achieved in mice by coupling muramyl dipeptides to tumor cells, along with eliciting T lymphocytes specifically reactive to Bacillus Calmette-Guerin. Noncytotoxic T helper lymphocytes produce factors which recruit nonspecific (macrophages) as well as specific (cytolytic T lymphocytes) anti-tumor attacking cells. In this way protection can be afforded against primary tumors and metastases, as well as leukemia cells. As the activity of helper lymphocytes rests mostly on lymphokine release, the use of molecularly defined lymphokines mimicking T-helper functions has also been attempted. In a few experimental models, the association of low doses of IL-2 with non-reactive lymphocytes from tumor-bearing mice promotes an effective anti-tumor reaction in the host. Moreover, the combination of distinct lymphokines can also build a molecularly defined helper system able to activate in sequence non-specific and specific anti-tumor reactions in vivo. Trials intended to evaluate the clinical impact of these helper approaches in the management of human tumors are being started or are already under way.",,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '53678-77-6 (Acetylmuramyl-Alanyl-Isoglutamine)']",,,"['Institute of Microbiology, University of Torino, Italy.']",,,,

The rate of MTX accumulation in ADR-sensitive cells that have acquired resistance to MTX was found to be lower than that measured in cells that were sensitive to both drugs. Furthermore, in contrast to drug-sensitive cells, in the ADR-sensitive MTX-resistant cells, most of the intracellular MTX (86.2%) was bound and MTX polyglutamation was not detected. The initial rate of MTX accumulation in cells that were resistant to both drugs was comparable to that measured in cells that were sensitive to both drugs or that were resistant only to ADR. However, in the cells that were resistant to both drugs, the rate of MTX accumulation was maintained at its initial level for a period that was considerably longer than that found in the other cell lines. After 3 h of exposure to MTX, the accumulation of MTX in cells that were resistant to both drugs was fourfold higher than that measured in cells that were sensitive to both drugs. Furthermore, while 65 to 70% of the intracellular MTX was free, in cells sensitive to both drugs, or resistant only to ADR, the corresponding value in cells that were resistant to both drugs was less than 1.5%, and a much lower proportion of the MTX was polyglutamated. The sensitivity to TMQ of ADR-sensitive, MTX-resistant cells was similar to that found in cells that were sensitive to ADR and MTX. However, ADR-resistant cells, sensitive or resistant to MTX, were markedly resistant to TMQ. The sensitivity of ADR-resistant MTX-sensitive cells to TMQ was restored by the presence of 10 microM verapamil. Such an effect was not observed in cells resistant to both drugs. It is suggested that P388 cells that have previously acquired resistance to ADR, when now selected by MTX, retain the MTX-transport system (in contrast to ADR-sensitive, MTX-resistant cells) and become resistant to MTX by increasing the activity of DHFR. The results obtained in ADR-resistant cells also suggested that resistance to TMQ was part of the multidrug resistance phenomenon.",,"['0 (Quinazolines)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)', 'UPN4ITI8T4 (Trimetrexate)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",,,"['Sharett Institute of Oncology, Hadassah University Hospital, Jerusalem, Israel.']",,,,

We have found that the increased expression of MHM6 reactivity seen on B cells after activation results from up-regulation of antigen on cells already weakly positive and not from expression of new antigen on the previously negative population. The strong proliferative responses of MHM6+ cells seen in the presence of anti-IgM (alpha mu) and interleukin 4 (IL4) or the CDw40 mAb G28-5, and with Staphylococcus aureus Cowan I (SAC), and to a lesser extent with the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA), resemble that seen among unfractionated B cells. In contrast, the MHM6- population cultured alone responds only weakly to alpha mu + G28-5 or SAC and exhibits virtually no response to alpha mu + IL4 or TPA. With all these mitogenic stimuli, tritiated thymidine uptake by the MHM6- population is augmented three- to sixfold by the addition of mitomycin C (MC)-treated MHM6+ cells. Pretreatment of cells with anti-leukocyte functional antigen 1 mAb has little effect on the subsequent proliferation of the MHM6- population but shows cell contact to be critical for the proliferation of MHM6+ cells. Such pretreatment has revealed that the functional interaction observed between MHM6+ and MHM6- cells is dependent on both cell contact and the presence of an MHM6+ cell-derived soluble component. We have found that addition of soluble CD23, purified from Epstein-Barr virus-transformed lymphoblastoid cell line supernatant, increases the proliferative response of MHM6- tonsil B cells to mitogenic stimuli in the presence of inactivated MHM6+ cells but has no effect on proliferation when MHM6+ cells are absent. By way of contrast to normal B lymphocytes, we have examined functional responses of prolymphocytic leukemia (PLL) B cells. Although these cells, when freshly isolated, show comparable levels of CD23 expression to normal B cells, this expression is not increased upon activation. In addition, in contrast to normal B cells, the PLL MHM6- population cultured alone shows a strong proliferative response to various mitogenic stimuli, comparable to that of MHM6+ or unfractionated cells, and this response is not augmented by the addition of MC-treated MHM6+ cells. Thus, a novel functional interaction is described between normal, but not leukemic, B cell populations defined by their expression of CD23.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)']",,,"['I.C.R.F.

In vivo differentiation of myeloid leukemic cells was studied in intraperitoneally implanted diffusion chambers, containing different soluble antigens. The presence of these antigens in the chambers induced differentiation of myeloid leukemic cells and this was inhibited in immune-deficient mice. Transfer of normal spleen cells enriched for T-lymphocytes or antigen-specific helper T lymphocyte cell lines to mice in which differentiation of leukemic cells was inhibited, restored in vivo differentiation of the leukemic cells. Antigen-specific helper T cells produce myeloid regulatory proteins and can accumulate at a site that contains the specific antigen. It is suggested that migration in response to antigen of helper T cells producing regulatory proteins may play an important role in inducing in vivo differentiation of leukemic cells. We have identified a class of myeloid leukemic cells that can be induced to differentiate in vitro by incubation with pure MGI-1GM (GM-CSF) or IL-3, but not with MGI-1G (G-CSF). Experiments with pure recombinant proteins have shown that MGI-1GM and IL-3, but not MGI-1G, can also induce these myeloid leukemic cells to differentiate in vivo.

Cellular transformation most probably results from the activation of cellular oncogenes or putative proto-oncogenes due to proviral integration. Several genetic changes are likely to be necessary for the appearance of fully malignant cells. However, the sequence of genetic changes initiating and leading to malignant transformation is difficult to study since, in most experimental conditions, the only accessible cells are fully transformed cells. We have previously described an in vitro model of murine myeloblastic leukemogenesis during which several successive steps leading to fully malignant and transplantable cells have been identified. This in vitro transformation process develops over approximately a 1-year period.

A flow cytofluorometric examination of the spleen cells of mAb-treated mice revealed that antibody treatment resulted in the elimination of greater than 98% of L3T4+ T cells, but had no effect on the Lyt-2+ T cells subset. Tumor regression was immunologically mediated, because L5178Y lymphoma cells were shown to be L3T4-, and regression of the tumor failed to occur in mice that had been lethally irradiated before anti-L3T4 mAb was given. Tumor regression was mediated by tumor-sensitized Lyt2+ T cells, as evidenced by the finding that treatment of tumor-bearing mice with anti-Lyt-2 mAb alone, or in combination with anti-L3T4 mAb, resulted in enhancement of tumor growth and a significant decrease in host survival time. Moreover, the spleens of mice whose tumors were undergoing regression in response to anti-L3T4 mAb treatment contained Lyt-2+ T cells capable, on passive transfer, of causing regression of a tumor in recipient mice. These results can be interpreted as showing that removal of tumor-induced L3T4+ suppressor T cells results in the release of Lyt-2+ effector T cells from suppression, and consequently in the generation of enough Lyt-2+ T cell-mediated immunity to cause tumor regression. This can only be achieved, however, if immunity to the tumor is mediated exclusively by Lyt-2+ T cells, as is the case for the L5178Y lymphoma. In the case of the P815 mastocytoma, treatment with anti-L3T4 mAb was without a therapeutic effect, and this was in keeping with the finding that immunity to this tumor is mediated by L3T4+, as well by Lyt-2+ T cells.","['CA-16642/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-27794/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)']",,PMC2189164,"['Trudeau Institute, Saranac Lake, New York 12983.']",,,,

Cross-linking of these receptors provides the immunologic stimulus which initiates a series of biochemical events, culminating in secretion of inflammatory mediators. In an attempt to identify membrane components involved in the stimulus-secretion coupling of these cells, hybridomas were produced from splenocytes of mice immunized with intact RBL-2H3 cells. Here we report the production of a mAb (designated G63) that inhibits the Fc epsilon R-mediated secretion from RBL cells. At low degrees of Fc epsilon R aggregation, the mAb G63-induced inhibition may be complete, whereas at the maximum of secretion the inhibition is in the range of 30 to 40%. The relative degree of inhibition of secretion is dependent on the dose of mAb G63. Furthermore, inhibition requires the bivalency of G63, as the Fab fragments are inactive. The number of antigenic epitopes recognized by G63 per RBL-2H3 cell is 1.8 x 10(4) epitopes/cell, as determined by direct binding studies of 125I-labeled Fab fragments of G63. This number is 20 to 30 times smaller than that of Fc epsilon R on the same cells. The membrane component to which G63 binds has been identified by immunoprecipitation as a glycoprotein with an apparent Mr of 58 to 70 kDa. All of these results, and the fact that no competition for binding to RBL cells between mAb G63 and IgE can be resolved, indicate that mAb G63 binds to a membrane component which is distinct from the Fc epsilon R. mAb G63 suppresses the Fc epsilon R-mediated rise in cytoplasmic concentration of free Ca2+ ions, known to be one of the biochemical signals involved in the stimulus-secretion coupling in RBL-2H3 cells. G63 does not affect, however, the degranulation induced by the Ca2+ ionophore A23187. Therefore, mAb G63 probably exerts its inhibitory effect on a step preceding the rise in cytoplasmic free Ca2+. Thus, mAb G63 defines a previously unidentified membrane component that is involved in one of the early steps of the RBL-2H3 activation mediated by their Fc epsilon R.",,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Cross-Linking Reagents)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",,,"['Department of Chemical Immunology, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel.']",,,,

Conditioned medium (CM) from cultured peripheral blood cells from atopic individuals and 18 out of 22 analysed glioma cell lines induced differentiation of the KU812 cells, whereas supernatant from only 1 out of 21 other cell lines, including carcinoma, melanoma, sarcoma, leukaemia, and normal fibroblasts had this activity.

Heparanase activity has been previously shown to be expressed by activated lymphocytes and macrophages and by highly metastatic tumor cells, in correlation with their ability to invade blood vessels and extracellular matrices. Incubation of HL-60 and U-937 cells with sulfate-labeled ECM in the presence of 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA) resulted in heparanase-mediated release of heparan sulfate degradation products. This degradation was inhibited by heparin, stimulated by plasminogen and not expressed by cells treated with retinoic acid or dimethylsulfoxide and undergoing neutrophilic differentiation. Heparanase activity was not detected in media conditioned by HL-60 and U-937 cells but was found in their cell lysates, regardless of whether or not the cells were exposed to TPA. These findings imply that TPA-induced differentiation of human myeloid leukemic cells to macrophage-like cells, but not to neutrophilic granulocytes, is associated with expression on the cell surface of a preformed heparanase activity.

The above suggests that, like myc gene, glucocorticoid collaborates with v-abl or activated ras oncogene to transform unestablished rat cells and that the transformation phenotypes were determined not only by the introduced oncogene but by the cellular condition including their tissue origin. Transformation of senescent REabl cells in the absence of DX was tested by transfecting different oncogenes.

Similarly, a reduced number of cells with the markers Leu 7 and Leu 11b (CD 16) were detected in the same patients. Removal of the leukemic cells by centrifugation of cells forming rosettes with mouse erythrocytes led to an augmented, but not fully normalized, NK activity. This indicates that the low NK activity in CLL partly may be due to overgrowth of leukemic cells. However, in spite of the lymphocytic infiltration, the NK cell activity in the bone marrow of CLL patients did not differ significantly from that of normal controls. The patients with CML in the chronic phase as well as patients in the accelerated or blast phase also had a reduced NK activity. The finding that patients in the chronic phase had a reduced NK activity and normal numbers of Leu 11b (CD 16) positive cells, together with no detectable blasts in the peripheral blood, indicates that patients with CML may have an inherent NK cell defect. The highly reduced activity found in patients with the accelerated/blast form may in addition partly be due to overgrowth of leukemic cells.

Light chain monoclonality was most frequent in low grade and follicular center cell (FCC) lymphomas, while SIg-negative cases were most common in high grade and non-FCC types. Low grade lymphomas of all histologic types had high median percentages of neoplastic cells and low T-cell percentages. Conversely, high grade lymphomas exhibited lower and less uniform median percentages of B-cells, with higher numbers of T-cells and lower CD4/CD8 ratios than low grade lymphomas. Several differences in B- and T-cells were observed between specific high grade histologic types. FCC lymphomas with a diffuse pattern had lower percentages of CD4+ cells and lower CD4/CD8 ratios than cases with a follicular pattern.

In an effort to identify biologic features of ALL in children less than 2 that might explain this difference, we performed extensive immunophenotypic and molecular genetic analyses on a series of patients. For comparison purposes patients were divided into four groups: CALLA- (CD10-) infants less than 2 years of age at diagnosis (n = 10), CALLA- children greater than 2 years of age at diagnosis (n = 10), CALLA+ infants (less than 2 years, n = 21) and CALLA+ children (older than 2 years, n = 21). No immunophenotyping differences in CALLA- or CALLA+ subgroups were identified when cases less than 2 were compared with cases greater than 2 years of age at diagnosis. The most interesting results were in the CALLA- group where 94% of the samples expressed the B cell antigen CD19 but 27% co-expressed CD7. Double labeling experiments confirmed leukemic blast cells co-expressed CD19 and CD7. The double-labeled cells represent either leukemic conversion of a precursor cell which has not yet committed to B or T cell lineage or aberrant expression of these antigens. Molecular genetic studies demonstrated that all samples, regardless of the patients' age or immunophenotype, had rearrangement of the Ig heavy chain gene. The most striking molecular results were in CALLA- patients; in patients less than 2 at diagnosis neither the beta- nor the gamma-chain gene of the T cell receptor (TCR) was rearranged, whereas DNA from 5 of 10 patients over the age of 2 demonstrated beta- or gamma-chain TCR gene rearrangements. The percentage of CALLA+ cases under the age of 2 years with rearrangements in TCR genes is less than that found in CALLA+ cases over the age of 2 years. The finding of no TCR rearrangements in CALLA- ALL and a decreased number of gamma-TCR rearrangements in CALLA+ cases under the age of 2 suggest that age may affect TCR gene rearrangements in lymphoblasts. The molecular differences in TCR gene rearrangements do not appear to correlate with the response to therapy.","['CA-20180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-43237/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']","['0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', 'EC 3.4.24.11 (Neprilysin)']",,,"[""Department of Hematology-Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38101.""]",,,,

RA suppressed IgG-coated erythrocyte (EA) rosette formation of myelomonocytic cells blocked at relatively late stages of differentiation such as ML-1, U-937, THP-1-T, normal monocytes, and fresh cells of patients with acute myelomonocytic leukemia. However, RA increased the percentage of EA rosetting promyelocytes of HL-60 and of patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia and a part of myeloblasts isolated from acute myelogenous leukemia patients. Other myeloblasts including KG-1a, KG-1, and fresh cells from patients with acute myelogenous leukemia were not affected. A kinetic study using HL-60 and THP-1-T demonstrated that an increase required at least a 48-h exposure and that the maximum decrease required approximately 6 h. The RA effect on both cell lines was dose-dependent. The number of Fc gamma R of HL-60 and THP-1-T treated with RA became very close, although untreated THP-1 had almost 10 times as many as HL-60.

The agent is extensively protein bound, and hepatic biotransformation plays a major role in its elimination. In early phase II testing, nine of 15 patients who experienced life-threatening or fatal toxic effects from trimetrexate had albumin levels less than or equal to 3.5 g/dL prior to treatment. This prompted a review of the data base on 272 patients entered in phase I clinical trails. The incidence of severe or life-threatening anemia, leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, mucositis, and hepatic toxic effects during the first course of trimetrexate was analyzed according to dose, schedule, prior treatment, and baseline protein and albumin levels. The schedules using doses given by short infusions of 30-60 minutes daily for 5 days or weekly for 3 weeks were generally associated with higher incidence of toxic effects than the schedules using doses given every other week by short infusions or those using continuous infusion. The occurrence of leukopenia and mucositis was dose related. Patients with baseline albumin levels less than or equal to 3.5 g/dL had higher incidence of all types of severe or life-threatening toxic effects than those with albumin levels greater than or equal to 3.6 g/dL, and the differences were significant for the development of anemia, thrombocytopenia, and mucositis. Similar correlations were noted for pretreatment protein levels less than or equal to 6.0 g/dL. The small cohort of patients with leukemia experienced substantial toxic effects and tended to have low protein and albumin levels. Performance status and prior therapy did not emerge as strong predictors of severe toxic effects in the univariate analysis. Multivariate analysis confirmed that the type of cancer (leukemia vs. solid tumor), dose, schedule, and baseline albumin level were significant and independent predictors of severe and life-threatening toxic effects in the phase I patient population. Multivariate analysis including only patients with solid tumors indicated that albumin level, dose, and schedule remained significant predictors of toxic effects. Since normal liver function as reflected by bilirubin and transaminase values were a requirement for eligibility, the results suggest that albumin and protein levels may provide a more sensitive index of hepatic function.

EL-4 clones are able to suppress up to 80% of the total IgM responses in both systems, as well as to help. Suppression and help fluctuate between high and low levels with the numbers of EL-4 cells placed into tissue cultures. In Poisson plots, this is reflected as a ""typical curve"": usually one or two frequencies are estimated (e.g., integral of 1/4 and approximately 1/1000 for suppression and approximately 1/6 and approximately 1/200 for help), which appear regulated with increasing numbers of cells seeded. Control experiments showed that EL-4 cells need to be alive to exert the effects. EL-4 cells do not serve as additional antigen, do not induce an isotype switch and are not cytotoxic. Help and suppression are not restricted by the MHC. Help requires the presence of a small number of normal T cells in the assay system, indicating that EL-4 cells do not replace specific helper T cells. When a number of control cell lines were analyzed under identical circumstances, similar effects were observed with most long term T cell lines or clones expressing a T cell receptor, whereas cells of non-T lineages and T cells not expressing a T cell receptor did not show the phenomena.

C3H/HeJ mice, which have previously been described to be LPS hyporesponsive and have a defect in Fc gamma R function, did not respond to anti-idiotype therapy as well as C3H/HeN normal mice. This defect was completely corrected in animals treated simultaneously with IFN. Anti-idiotype mAb that was cleaved into F(ab')2 fragments no longer had any antitumor activity alone and could not be enhanced by IFN therapy.

Exposure of L1210 cells to folinic acid resulted in expansion of intracellular pools of 5,10-CH2-H4PteGlun, delayed the reappearance of catalytically active thymidylate synthase (TS) following 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine exposure, and stabilized inhibited TS complexes over the same concentration range that augmented the cytotoxic effects of fluorodeoxyuridine and 5-fluorouracil. The data showed that, in intact L1210 cells, fluorodeoxyridylate behaves as an inhibitor whose complexes with TS dissociated with a biologically significant rate. However, these complexes become functionally irreversible in cells incubated with high levels of folinic acid. It was also found that bound and total TS levels increased in cells treated with fluorodeoxyuridine to an extent that substantially exceeded the increase in protein content per cell under the same conditions. These results are in accord with the concept that folinic acid augments the effects of the fluoropyrimidines by expansion of cellular 5,10-CH2-H4PteGlun pools with subsequent stabilization of ternary complexes among 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine 5'-monophosphate, TS, and 5,10-CH2-H4PteGlun. In light of the accumulation of TS that occurs following exposure to fluoropyrimidines, this stabilization may be needed for efficient tumor cell killing by these agents.",['CA-36054/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['039LU44I5M (Floxuridine)', 'EC 2.1.1.45 (Thymidylate Synthase)', 'Q573I9DVLP (Leucovorin)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)']",,,"['Department of Pediatrics, University of Southern California School of Medicine, Los Angeles.']",,,,

In this study we have compared the M1-A5 cell line with four other IL-3-dependent cell lines to determine whether these dual activities are universally associated with IL-3 dependence and to test the hypothesis that there is a direct relationship between the cytotoxic and the suppressive activities. The cell lines tested were a bone marrow derived Dexter culture derived line (FDC-P1), two Moloney leukemia virus induced leukemias (DA-1 and DA-3), and a mast cell line (PT18(A17]. All lines were dependent on IL-3 for survival but FDC-P1, DA-1, and DA-3 showed varying degrees of short-term proliferation in granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF). The cell lines all expressed asialo GM1 and Ly-5 surface markers but differed with respect to other markers. DA-1 expressed MAC-1, FDC-P1 and DA-3 expressed Thy-1, and PT18(A17) expressed receptors for the Fc portion of IgE. The cell lines varied greatly in their cytotoxic activity against WEHI-164. FDC-P1, DA-1, and PT18(A17) had low NC activity. DA-3 had consistently high activity, greater than that seen with M1-A5 cells. However, none of the cell lines secreted constitutively a suppressor cell inducing factor (SIF). In addition, it was demonstrated that recombinant murine TNF did not activate suppressor cells capable of inhibiting antibody synthesis and that anti-TNF did not block SIF activity, thus suggesting that TNF contamination of the M1-A5 derived SIF preparation is not responsible for the induction of suppressor cells. We conclude that suppressor cell inducing factors are not universally secreted by IL-3-dependent cell lines, that there is no correlation between NC and SIF activity, and that the dual activities of M1-A5 cells are not mediated by TNF.",,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Biological Factors)', '0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",,,"['Department of Pharmacology, Dalhousie University, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada.']",,,,

In contrast, the myeloma cells of all four cases were judged to be immature and abnormal on the basis of the electron microscopic observation. Characteristic features were sparse heterochromatin, high to moderate nucleocytoplasmic ratio, nuclear bodies, thin and short rough endoplasmic reticula, scattered pattern of mitochondria, and polysomes consisting of five to six ribosomes, along with irregular nuclear membrane, poorly developed organella, and abnormalities in cytoplasmic structures such as dense bodies, vacuoli, buddings, single-sac loop-like structures, multilamellar bodies, and abnormal inclusion bodies.

The same two molecules also bind to rat IgG-Sepharose but with a lower affinity. R is a component of the high affinity Fc receptor for IgE. In the present study the inhibition of the binding of R and H to rat IgG-Sepharose by various homologous and heterologous immunoglobulins was used to assess their relative affinities for the two receptor molecules. Ranking the rat immunoglobulins in order of their affinities for the R receptor yielded: IgE much greater than IgG2a greater than IgG1 greater than IgG2b; and for H: IgE greater than IgG2b greater than IgG1 greater than IgG2a. Rat IgG2c inhibited the binding of both R and H but a precise ranking could not be assigned. Conclusive evidence has been obtained for the Fc specificity of these interactions. The affinities of the mouse IgG subclass/R interactions can be ranked: IgG1 greater than IgG2a greater than IgG2b; and for the H receptor: IgG1 greater than IgG2b greater than IgG2a.

In the present study, several immune and hematologic parameters were studied in DS children under 6 years of age and in age-matched controls. The children with DS exhibited a reduced number of lymphocytes while the total number of white blood cells was normal. In addition, the children with DS had reduced numbers of circulating OKT4+ cells and a significantly depressed ratio of OKT4+ to OKT8+ cells, but their overall proportion of T-cells was normal. Normal NK activity was observed and cells from DS children were no more sensitive to the augmenting effects of alpha interferon than cells from control children.

A. (1983) Mol. Pharmacol. 24, 479-484). It is not known whether these two transport activities are mediated by a single protein or by separate and distinct nucleoside transport proteins. We have isolated a mutant from the L1210 cell line that has lost the NBMPR-insensitive component of nucleoside transport, but retains NBMPR-sensitive transport. In the parental cell line 20-40% of the nucleoside transport activity is insensitive to 1 microM NBMPR. In the mutant, however, uridine and thymidine transport are almost completely inhibited by NBMPR. Consistent with the loss of NBMPR-insensitive transport, the mutant cells can be protected from the toxic effects of several nucleoside analogs by NBMPR. In contrast, the toxicity of the same analogs in the wild type cells is not significantly affected by NBMPR, presumably due to uptake of the nucleosides via the NBMPR-insensitive transporter. On the other hand, NBMPR-sensitive transport in the mutant appears to be unaltered. The mutant is not resistant to cytotoxic nucleosides in the absence of NBMPR and the cells retain the wild type complement of high affinity binding sites for NBMPR. Furthermore, the affinity of the binding site for the inhibitor is similar to that of parental L1210 cells. These results suggest that NBMPR-sensitive and NBMPR-insensitive nucleoside transport in L1210 cells are mediated by genetically distinct proteins.

Since appropriate therapy for these tumors depends on their precise identification, we have studied a series of tissues infiltrated with primitive myeloid cells using monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies capable of labeling cells of the myeloid/monocytic system in paraffin-embedded tissue sections. The current retrospective study involved tissues from 15 patients (eight men and seven women) with a mean age of 51 years (range, 23-77). A diagnosis of extramedullary myeloid cell tumors had been made on the basis of routine histology, chloroacetate esterase cytochemical stain, and--in some cases--electron microscopy. Paraffin-embedded tissue sections were cut and stained employing the alkaline phosphatase antialkaline phosphatase (APAAP) immunocytochemical procedure with monoclonal antibodies against leukocyte-common antigen (PD7/26-2B11), restricted components of the leukocyte-common antigen (UCHL1, 4KB5), granulocytes (Mac-387, Leu-M1), leukocytes (MT1, MT2, LN1, LN2), HLA-DR (LN3), and elastase (NP57), as well as polyclonal antibodies against lactoferrin, lysozyme, alpha-1-antitrypsin, and alpha-1-antichymotrypsin. Results indicate that antibodies against Mac-387, elastase, and lysozyme are most useful in the recognition of neoplastic myeloid cells.

In addition to the IgE-binding alpha chain, the receptor contains a single beta chain and two, disulfide-linked, gamma chains. From a cDNA library of a rat mucosal mast cell tumor, from which we recently cloned cDNAs coding for the alpha chain, we have now isolated cDNAs coding for the beta subunit. In vitro transcription-translation of the cDNA directed the synthesis of a polypeptide reactive with two distinctive anti-beta monoclonal antibodies and whose molecular weight was identical to that of authentic beta chains. Polyclonal antibodies to beta peptides expressed in Escherichia coli reacted with intact receptors and isolated beta chains. The gene encodes a protein of 243 residues with no leader sequence. A hydropathicity plot suggests that the polypeptide crosses the plasma membrane four times. The epitope recognized by one of the monoclonal antibodies was localized to the NH2 terminus; that by the other was localized to the COOH terminus. Since those antibodies react with membranes and not with intact cells, we suggest that both ends of the beta subunit are cytoplasmic.

Polysaccharide fractions with molecular weights ranging between 20,000 and 1,000,000 and higher have been isolated from the aqueous alkaline extract of the herbal parts of T. occidentale L. by ethanol precipitation and fractionation by ultrafiltration. High molecular subfractions of Thujapolysaccharides (TPS) proved to be highly mitogenic on peripheral blood leukocytes. It was demonstrated by the alcalic immune phosphatase-antiphosphatase and Pappenheim staining methods that the mitogenic and cluster-forming activity of TPS cause T cell induction, in particular, of CD 4-positive T-helper/inducer cells as opposed to B cells. The CD-4+ T-helper/inducer cell induction is connected to an increased production of IL-2. The cluster-forming ability and mitogenity of TPS correlates well with the 3H-thymidine uptake and seems to be IL-1 and IFN-gamma dependent as could be shown by blocking the mitogenic effect using anti-IL-1- and anti-IFN antibodies.

We have isolated the complete J alpha locus, bounded on the 5' side by the C sequence of the delta gene and on the 3' side by the C sequence of the alpha gene. The experiments described here demonstrate that the J gene segments extend 75 kb 5' of C alpha and participate equally in generating the diversity of the alpha chain in peripheral T cells. Similarly, in leukemic T cell lines, rearrangements occurred over the entire locus and involved both alleles. Densitometry data suggest that in most peripheral T cells both alleles also are rearranged; thus, allelic exclusion in the alpha locus does not occur at the level of rearrangement.

Sixty-five rearranged alleles were studied. The authors first describe the cloning and sequencing of two variable segments, V gamma 11 and psi V gamma 12, which rearrange in T- and B-neoplastic cells. To date three subgroups of translatable V gamma segments have been described. The authors show that V gamma 11 is the unique member of a new fourth V gamma subgroup that also rearranges in normal polyclonal T cells and that psi V gamma 12 is located at 5-kilobase (kb) downstream to V gamma 11. As shown by DNA sequence analysis, V gamma 11 shares a 60% homology with V gamma 10 (third subgroup) and a 50% homology with V gamma 9 (second subgroup) but no appreciable homology with the V gamma segments from the first family. In contrast to psi V gamma 12, V gamma 11 is translatable. In this paper the authors have also attempted to determine which V gamma segments were rearranged in the ALL cases by hybridization with a J gamma probe and genomic probes specific of the four subgroups. In the 54 instances in which the rearrangement was consistent with J gamma 1 or J gamma 2 involvement, the authors have identified the corresponding V gamma segments and have not found any other rearrangements suggestive of the existence of further V regions. The V gamma segments, belonging to the first subgroup, were the most frequently used (41 alleles). V gamma 9, V gamma 10, V gamma 11, and psi V gamma 12 were found rearranged in cases 3, 4, 5, and 1, respectively. No cases using the pseudo psi V gamma 1, psi V gamma 5, and psi V gamma 6 segments were found. Pseudo V gamma segments were not found rearranged in T cells, while V gamma 2 and V gamma 4, segments are frequently used. In contrast to the V gamma I gene rearrangement, the involvement of the V gamma II, V gamma III, and V gamma IV subgroups was most frequently observed in T-ALL with stage II differentiation (CD7+, CD4+, and/or CD8+, CD3-), than in those with stage I (CD7+, CD4-, CD8-, CD3-), than in those with stage I (CD7+, CD4-, CD8-, CD3-) and stage III (CD7+, CD4+/-CD8+/-CD3+).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",,,"['Institut National de la Sante, Hopital Saint Louis, Paris, France.']",,,,

Phorbol ester (PMA), synergistically with calcium ionophore (A23187), caused 55% of the total PKC activity to associate rapidly with membranes where it remained for at least 20 min. When IgE-loaded cells were activated by Ag, maximally 30% of the cytosolic activity associated with membranes within 15 to 30 s, but most of this returned to the cytosol by 2 min. The small amount (3%) of PKC activity that remained associated with the membranes did so for at least 20 min but only if aggregation of the receptors was maintained. PKC translocation correlated with aggregation of receptors both at 30 s and at 10 min. However, only the translocation at 10 min and not that at 30 s correlated with receptor-induced exocytosis. In the absence of extracellular calcium (no exocytosis is observed), translocation at 30 s was diminished by 30% and at 10 min was completely absent. Cells depleted of PKC by 18-h treatment with PMA failed to degranulate in response to PMA and A23187 but responded partially (35%) when receptors were aggregated.

NALM-6 (a pre-B-ALL cell line) cells were transplanted under varying conditions as the pre-B-leukemia cells, whereas REH (a non-T/non-B-ALL cell line) cells were transplanted as the non-T/non-B-leukemia cells. Under optimal and near optimal conditions, 71 of 101 X-irradiated mice (70%) developed distinct tumors approximately 2 wk after i.d. inoculation of a mixture of NALM-6 cells and X-irradiated human fibrosarcoma cells. Under the same conditions, 9 of 11 mice (82%) developed tumors following i.d. inoculation of REH cells admixed with X-irradiated human fibrosarcoma cells. Examination of the tumor tissues demonstrated that the tumors are of leukemia origin but not of fibrosarcoma origin. To demonstrate the usefulness of the present tumors for investigating the efficacy of antitumor agents in the in vivo therapy of human cancer, immunotoxins were tested for their specific suppressive activity against growing tumors of the transplanted NALM-6 cells. To this end, monoclonal antibodies SN5 and SN6 which define a common ALL antigen, termed CALLA, and a novel leukemia-associated cell surface glycoprotein, termed gp160, respectively, were separately conjugated with the A-chain subunit of ricin, a plant toxin; CALLA and gp160 are expressed on the cell surface of various human non-T-leukemia cells including NALM-6 cells. The conjugates of SN5 and SN6 with ricin A-chain (RA) showed specific activity against the leukemia cells but not against control cells in an in vitro assay. To investigate their in vivo efficacy in suppressing tumor growth, nude mice which had been inoculated i.d. with NALM-6 cells 25 days in advance and bore distinct palpable tumors (5 to 6 mm in diameter) were divided into five groups. One group of mice was nontreated as a control. Each of the remaining four groups of mice was given an injection of one of the following agents: (a) purified control mouse IgG (IgG1); (b) purified antibodies SN5 (IgG1) and SN6 (IgG1); (c) control IgG-RA conjugate; or (d) SN5-RA and SN6-RA.

Twenty-nine of these patients were alive and in remission 3 months post BMT and were evaluable for this analysis of whom eleven have developed renal dysfunction. Six of 17 (35%) evaluable ALL patients developed renal dysfunction (3.5 to 6 months post BMT). This group was transplanted for CALLA positive ALL and received an autologous transplant. Preparation included tenopiside (VM 26) cytosine arabinoside, and cyclophosphamide followed by total body irradiation (TBI). One patient received 850 cGy in a single fraction, while all other patients received fractionated TBI (1200-1400 cGy in 6-8 fractions over 3-4 days). Five of 7 (71%) evaluable patients who received a BMT for NB have developed late renal problems (4-7 months after BMT). The preparation for NB patients included VM 26, cis-platinum, melphalan, cyclophosphamide, and fractionated TBI (1200-1296 cGy). All seven NB patients had received cis-platinum as induction treatment prior to transplantation. All patients presented with anemia, hematuria, and elevations of BUN and creatinine. Two patients underwent renal biopsies which were consistent with radiation nephropathy or hemolytic uremic syndrome. In conclusion, a high incidence of renal dysfunction has occurred 3 to 7 months after BMT for children with NB and ALL. The clinical and laboratory features are consistent with either acute radiation nephropathy or hemolytic-uremic syndrome. These patients were prepared for BMT with multiple chemotherapeutic agents as well as TBI. The relatively young age of these patients and conditioning with intensive multi-agent chemotherapy may decrease the tolerance of the kidney to radiation injury.","['2PO1 CA 34183-04A1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 HL-36028/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', 'EC 3.4.24.11 (Neprilysin)']",,,"['Department Radiation Therapy, Joint Center for Radiation Therapy, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115.']",,,,

We studied four untreated children with JCML and report additional unique findings. Peripheral blood (PB) and bone marrow (BM) cells were grown in soft agar. Without exogenous colony-stimulating activity (CSA) there was exuberant ""spontaneous"" colony formation in both PB and BM cultures. In the absence of exogenous stimulus, PB colony morphology was predominantly, but not exclusively, monocyte/macrophage.

Cultures were also performed in the presence of various sources of CSA including giant cell tumor-conditioned medium (GCT-CM), a melanoma cell line-CM (LD1-CM), human placenta-CM (HPCM), and normal PB mononuclear cell (PBMC) feeder layers. Colony formation was typically increased with HPCM and PBMC, whereas in two patients GCT-CM and LD1-CM failed to stimulate additional colony growth when compared to cultures without exogenous CSA and, in fact, appeared to inhibit baseline ""spontaneous"" growth. The morphology of colonies in the presence of exogenous stimuli was highly variable. Because of the recent association between the c-fms protooncogene product and the receptor for the monocyte growth factor CSF-1, we analyzed the PB cells from two JCML patients for c-fms expression. Although expressed, c-fms levels were less than that in an adult with Ph1-positive CML in chronic phase. These studies indicate that in JCML, there are dramatic increases in both PB and BM colony-forming cells and that ""spontaneous"" growth is dependent on an accessory adherent cell fraction. Furthermore, patterns of responsiveness to various sources of CSA suggest that the colony-forming cells may not be a uniform population of malignant cells.",['CA-25408/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",,,"[""Department of Medicine, Children's Hospital of Alabama, University of Alabama, Birmingham 35294.""]",,,,

Clonal chromosome abnormalities were found in the cells of all patients with DS-AL but not those with DS-TMD. The younger ages and higher hemoglobin concentrations, platelet counts, and WBC counts of DS-TMD patients provided a clinical contrast with the frankly leukemic cases. Myelodysplastic syndrome, characterized by a small percentage of leukemic blast cells, was observed in 11 of the 13 patients with DS-AL compared with none in the DS-TMD group. Electron microscopy disclosed a positive platelet peroxidase reaction in each of the 11 DS-TMD patients and in nine of the 13 DS-AL patients. Immunologic studies revealed antiplatelet-megakaryocyte antigens on the blast cells of the majority of patients in both study groups. Our findings suggest that the blast cells in cases of DS-AL and DS-TMD arise from cells of the megakaryocytic lineage or from a myeloid progenitor with the capacity for megakaryocytic differentiation.

In order to examine the potential functional significance of CALLA/CD10 we analysed the expression of this molecule on neutrophils isolated from thermal injury patients, since these patients have a well-documented constellation of neutrophil defects affecting their microbicidal functions. Expression of neutrophil CALLA/CD10 was monitored by indirect immunofluorescence and flow cytometry. We observed that CALLA/CD10 expression was quantitatively reduced on burn patient neutrophils, compared to healthy donors (P less than 0.001). In contrast, burn patient neutrophils expressed normal levels of class I HLA molecules and the C3bi receptor. Reduced expression of CALLA/CD10 was not associated with neutrophil activation or exposure to plasma 'factor(s)' in vivo. Analysis of normal bone marrow neutrophils by cell sorting indicated that expression of CALLA/CD10 occurs late in neutrophil maturation, since 25% of polymorphonucleated bone marrow neutrophils did not express cell surface CALLA/CD10. Attempts to examine the chemotactic responses of CALLA/CD10 positive and negative neutrophils from burn patients were hampered by previous exposure of these cells to chemoattractants in vivo. Collectively, our findings suggest that burn patient peripheral blood neutrophils may be deficient in CALLA/CD10 due to insufficient maturation time in the bone marrow following thermal injury.","['CA-21737/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-23707/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-31685/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', 'EC 3.4.24.11 (Neprilysin)']",,,"['Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis 55455.']",,,,

This increase was greater than 10-fold following a 6-h incubation of cells with 3 microM FdUrd prior to selection in MTX, an interval one-half the normal L1210 cell cycle time. During this period of exposure to FdUrd, DNA synthesis decreased to 25% of control rates and cells accumulated at the G1/S interface. The 6-h incubation with FdUrd resulted in greater than a 2.5-fold increase in the dihydrofolate reductase protein level in the treated cell population, which was accounted for, at least in part, by increased de novo synthesis of the enzyme as assessed by [35S]methionine labeling. This increase in dihydrofolate reductase was associated with a decrease in growth inhibition by MTX. A brief reversal (2 h) of FdUrd-induced DNA synthesis inhibition by the addition of thymidine eliminated the amplification of dihydrofolate reductase and the enhanced emergence of MTX-resistant clones. Beyond this, an analysis of clones that survive MTX selection indicates that the dihydrofolate reductase gene copy in cells spontaneously resistant to 50 nM MTX and those which resulted after the additional pretreatment with FdUrd for 6 h are comparable with a 2-4-fold amplification of enzyme in most clones. These studies demonstrate that FdUrd enhancement of dihydrofolate reductase expression can have a profound effect upon the incidence and expression of MTX resistance and that dihydrofolate reductase gene amplification may be another basis for antagonism between these agents.","['CA 37026/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 07110/PHS HHS/United States']","['039LU44I5M (Floxuridine)', 'EC 1.5.1.3 (Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",,,"['Department of Medicine, Medical College of Virginia, Richmond 23298.']",,,,

They appear resistant to the antiproliferative action of IFN-gamma and to the induction of the antiviral state assessed by Friend leukemia virus release and vesicular stomatitis virus yield. Selection was performed via a prolonged exposure to increasing amounts of highly purified recombinant IFN-gamma of wild-type Friend cells or of variant clones thereof already resistant to IFN-alpha/beta (Affabris et al., 1982, Virology 120, 441-452). Only the clones derived from IFN-alpha/beta-resistant variants showed a phenotype fully resistant to IFN-gamma treatment while keeping their previously acquired resistance to IFN-alpha/beta. These cells are not deficient in high-affinity receptors for IFN-gamma so that their resistant phenotype appears to be mediated by events distal to binding of IFN-gamma to its receptors. Furthermore, analysis of IFN-induced dsRNA-dependent 2-5A synthetase and 67K protein kinase enzymatic activities, biochemical markers for cellular responses to IFN, showed that both these activities were not induced in IFN-alpha/beta and IFN-gamma-resistant clones when treated with either type of IFN. Accordingly, no increased expression of 2-5A synthetase mRNA(s) could be detected by probing poly(A)+-enriched RNA from cells exposed to IFN-alpha/beta or IFN-gamma treatment with murine or human specific cDNAs. On the other hand, no major changes in restriction patterns of 2-5A synthetase gene(s) were observed in these variant cells by restriction endonuclease digestion and Southern blotting. In addition, analysis of 2-5A synthetase mRNA induction, performed on wild-type cells, showed that the kinetic of induction due to IFN-gamma treatment is slower than that obtained with IFN-alpha/beta.",,"['0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Interferon)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', ""EC 2.7.7.84 (2',5'-Oligoadenylate Synthetase)""]",,,"['Laboratory of Virology, Istituto Superiore di Sanita, Rome, Italy.']",,,,

Experiments were, therefore, designed to investigate the intracellular signaling molecules regulating the appearance of HLA class II molecules. The expression of HLA class II (DR and DQ) molecules induced by IFN-gamma was blocked by a calmodulin antagonist, W7, but not by a protein kinase C inhibitor, H7. Furthermore, a direct activator of protein kinase C, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, was unable to induce HLA class II (DR) molecule expression. These results suggest that IFN-gamma induces HLA class II molecules on HL-60 cells by way of a calcium-calmodulin pathway and not by way of a protein kinase C pathway. Calmodulin is activated by a transient rise in the cytosolic free calcium. In fact, IFN-gamma evoked a calcium influx into HL-60 cells, whereas depletion of Ca2+ from culture medium resulted in a failure of IFN-gamma to induce DR expression. Furthermore, the calcium ionophore A23187 by itself induced DR molecule expression. These results suggest that IFN-gamma stimulates calcium influx by a so-called receptor-mediated calcium channel and activates the calmodulin branch of the calcium messenger system, resulting in the induction of DR molecules on the surface of HL-60 cells.",,"['0 (Calmodulin)', '0 (HLA-D Antigens)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Interferon)', '37H9VM9WZL (Calcimycin)', '526U7A2651 (Egtazic Acid)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'EC 3.1.4.- (Type C Phospholipases)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",,PMC280155,"['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Hamamatsu University School of Medicine, Japan.']",,,,

The relative proportions of the three forms of beta-thromboglobulin antigen present within platelets and megakaryocytes were determined in cells lysed with trichloroacetic acid to minimize artifactual proteolysis. Samples were analyzed by isoelectric focusing in polyacrylamide gel with quantitative immunological detection on a nitrocellulose transfer of the gel. In platelets, the major species found was low affinity platelet factor 4 with precursor platelet basic protein as only 25% +/- 11% (SD, n = 16) of total beta-thromboglobulin antigen. In megakaryocytes partially purified both from normal bone marrow aspirates and from whole marrow specimens obtained after surgery, platelet basic protein was a higher proportion of beta-thromboglobulin antigen (49% +/- 13% SD, n = 11) than was the case in platelets. beta-thromboglobulin itself was never detected under the conditions of cell lysis used. Our results suggest that platelet basic protein is synthesized in megakaryocytes and that its cleavage is associated with an earlier stage of cell development than simply maturation to platelets.

All eight patients were under 9 months of age and presented with leukocyte counts in excess of 60 X 10(9)/L, organomegaly, and in two cases CNS infiltration. Although seven cases were morphologically classified as ALL, one patient had both lymphoid and myeloid features. Phenotypic analysis of leukemic blasts from all patients showed a typical null ALL pattern, ie, CD10 (common ALL antigen)-negative, strongly HLA-DR-positive, and CD19 (B4)-positive. The presence of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) at presentation was positive in six patients' cells and negative in two. Two patients also expressed the myeloid-associated markers CD33 (MY9) and CD15 (TG1), and coexpression of CD19 and CD33 was confirmed in these two by using dual marker flow cytometry (fluorescence-activated cell sorting). Electron microscopic examination of the same two patients' cells showed the presence of monocytoid blasts that labeled with the pan-B cell antibody B4 (CD19). Short-term culture of one of these patients cells in the presence of phorbol ester resulted in the majority of the cells exhibiting myeloid markers, strong nonspecific esterase positivity, and phagocytic properties. Cytogenetic analysis showed the common feature in 7 of 8 cases to be a break in band 11q23. Molecular analysis of DNA from the blast cells of all eight patients showed rearrangement of the immunoglobulin heavy-chain genes in all cases without, however, any evidence of kappa light-chain rearrangement. T cell receptor genes were present in the germline configuration in all cases.

We have recently reported that hairy cells express specific IFN-alpha receptors which are down-regulated upon therapy. We show here that the activity of 2-5 A synthetase, an IFN-induced enzyme, is 2 to 7-fold stimulated in hairy cells from responsive patients within 12-24 h after the first IFN dose. This in-vivo enzyme induction paralleled the kinetics of receptor down-regulation. In one patient who was unresponsive to IFN-alpha treatment neither expression of IFN-alpha receptor nor change in 2-5 A synthetase were expressed and modulated as in sensitive patients. In-vitro treatment of hairy cells with recombinant interferons showed that IFN-beta 1 was able to induce this enzyme to the same extent than IFN-alpha 2, whereas IFN-gamma was inactive despite the presence of specific IFN-gamma receptors. Our results indicate that IFN-alpha can exert its therapeutic effects by acting directly on the hairy cells through interaction with surface membrane receptors. Induction of 2-5 A synthetase can be one of the steps involved in this action. However, both mechanisms, as well as receptor down-regulation are not sufficient to explain the responsiveness of hairy cell leukemia to IFN-alpha.",,"['0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Interferon)', ""EC 2.7.7.84 (2',5'-Oligoadenylate Synthetase)""]",,,"['Unite de recherches sur les interferons, INSERM U 196, Paris, France.']",,,,

However, these techniques have not been widely used for receptor detection by scanning electron microscopy. We used antigen- or protein A-conjugated colloidal gold particles, together with silver enhancement, sequential secondary and back-scattered electron imaging (SEI and BEI), and digital image processing, to explore cell surface distribution of IgE-receptor complexes on RBL-2H3 cells, a rat leukemia line that provides a model for the study of mucosal mast cells. Cells were first incubated with a monoclonal antidinitrophenol IgE (anti-DNP-IgE) that binds with high affinity to cell surface IgE receptors. The resulting IgE-receptor complexes were cross-linked either with the multivalent antigen, DNP-BSA-gold, or with a polyclonal anti-IgE antibody. Antibody-treated cells were labeled after fixation with protein A-gold. Fixed, gold-labeled cell monolayers were silver enhanced (or not), dehydrated, critical point-dried, and coated with gold-palladium (for SEI analysis) or carbon (for combined SEI/BEI analysis). They were observed in an Hitachi S800 SEM equipped with a field emission tip and a Robinson backscattered electron detector. An image processor (MegaVision 1024XM) digitized images directly from the S800 microscope at 500-1000 line resolution. Silver enhancement significantly improves detection of gold particles in both SEI and BEI modes of SEM. On gold-palladium-coated samples, 20-nm particles are resolved by SEI after enhancement. BEI resolves 15-nm particles without enhancement and 5- or 10-nm particles are resolved by BEI on silver-enhanced, carbon-coated samples. Neither BEI nor SEI alone can yield high resolution topographical maps of receptor distribution (BEI forms images on the basis of atomic number contrast which reveals gold but not surface features). Image analysis techniques were therefore introduced to digitize, enhance, and process BEI and SEI images of the same field of view. The resulting high-contrast, high-resolution images were superimposed, yielding well-resolved maps of the distribution of antigen-IgE-receptor complexes on the surface of RBL-2H3 mast cells. The maps are stored in digital form, as required for computer-based quantitative morphometric analyses. These techniques of silver enhancement, combined BEI/SEI imaging, and digital image analysis can be applied to analyze density and distribution of any gold-labeled ligand on its target cell.","['GM37202/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'RR02700/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'RR02768/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Receptors, Fc)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '3M4G523W1G (Silver)']",,,"['University of New Mexico School of Medicine, Department of Pathology, Albuquerque 87131.']",,,,

Without stimulation, TNF mRNA was barely detected in four T cell lines (CEM, KE4, MT-1, and SKW-3) and not detectable in Molt-4 and Jurkat cells, while a considerable amount of TNF mRNA was observed in HSB-2 cells. When stimulated by PMA, these T cell lines accumulated varying levels of TNF mRNA. All seven T cell lines expressed LT mRNA when unstimulated and responded well to PMA by increased accumulation of LT mRNA. The calcium ionophore A23187 by itself had no effect on TNF and LT mRNA accumulations in these cell lines. The CD3+ T cell lines did not respond to anti-CD3 mAb T3-II alone. However, A23187 and mAb T3-II further elevated TNF and LT mRNA accumulations in PMA-treated T cell lines. Synergism between PMA and mAb T3-II was modest in the CD3+ cell lines. A slight difference in kinetics of TNF and LT mRNA accumulations was noted. In addition, heterogeneities in TNF and LT expressions by these cell lines in responses to PMA and other stimuli were observed. In monocyte-depleted peripheral blood T cell populations. PMA was able to induce both TNF and LT mRNA syntheses. This effect was potentiated markedly by the addition of anti-CD3 mAb T3-II. This synergistic response to anti-CD3 mAb and PMA provided further evidence that T cells were the source of TNF synthesis in these cultures. There was a difference in the kinetics of TNF mRNA accumulation and that of LT mRNA. Maximal accumulation of TNF mRNA occurred at 4 h while 8-18 h was required for maximal LT mRNA accumulation. IL-2 mRNA accumulated at an intermediate peak time of 4-8 h. Western blot analyses and cytotoxicity assays with L cells as targets indicated that these T cell lines and peripheral blood T cells secreted TNF. These results provide further evidence that human T cells are capable of making TNF as well as LT under appropriate stimulations. Their productions are an integral part of T cell response to activation signals. In addition, it appears that the production of these two closely related molecules is independently regulated.","['CA-34546/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-37954/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (Lymphotoxin-alpha)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '37H9VM9WZL (Calcimycin)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,PMC2188890,"['Immunology Program, Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation, Oklahoma City 73104.']",,,,

The present study establishes a tumor-specific immunotherapy protocol for a murine chronic leukemia based on the above T-T cell collaboration between antitumor effector T cells and anti-MDP hapten helper T cells induced by BCG priming. BALB/c mice which had been primed to BCG were injected intravenously (i.v.) with viable, syngeneic BCL1 leukemia cells. One week later, these mice were immunized intraperitoneally (i.p.) with unmodified or MDP hapten-modified, 10,000 R X-irradiated BCL1 cells, followed by 4 booster immunizations at 5-day intervals. The administration of unmodified BCL1 tumor cells into BCG-primed mice failed to prevent them from tumor death due to the persistent growth of preinjected BCL1 cells. In contrast, the immunization of BCG-primed, BCL1 leukemia-cell-bearing mice with MDP-modified BCL1 cells resulted in a high growth inhibition of leukemia cells and protection of these mice from death by leukemia. It was also revealed that potent tumor-specific, T-cell-mediated immunity was generated in mice which survived in this immunotherapy model.

Assessment of cytotoxicity was by incorporation of 3H-leucine and limiting dilutions analysis. The effect of immunotoxins alone and in combination with hyperthermia on normal human marrow progenitor cells was assessed by conventional colony forming units-granulocyte macrophage (CFU-GM) assay. We found that incubation of either of the cell lines with a mixture of the two immunotoxins, RPH-7-ricin and PHM-6-ricin, at 42 degrees C for one hour (h) potentiated the cytotoxic activity of the immunotoxins at 37 degrees C. At a concentration of 10(-8) mol/L, a 2.2-log kill was seen with KM-3 leukaemic cells at 37 degrees C and a 3.3-log kill at 42 degrees C, an increase of approximately 10 fold in cytotoxic activity. Survival of CFU-GM following treatment at 42 degrees C for one h with a similar concentration of immunotoxins was 26.2% (+/- 13.7%) (equivalent to 0.6 log kill) and 76.0% (+/- 1.83%) (0.1 log kill) when normal marrow was incubated with immunotoxins at 37 degrees C. This suggests relative sparing of normal marrow cells compared with the leukaemic cells tested as indicated by the 2.1-log kill difference (approximately 100 fold) between normal and leukaemic cells at 37 degrees C and the 2.7-log kill (approximately 500-fold) difference at 42 degrees C.

Tm 1 was not expressed on T cells modulated with either IgG2a or IgG1 anti-CD3 mAb. Immunoprecipitation from 125I-labeled CD3-modulated T cells showed that Tm 1 Ag is a single polypeptide of 33 kDa under reducing and nonreducing conditions. Kinetic studies revealed that Tm 1 was detectable on T cells 10 min after incubation and maximally expressed after 4 h of incubation with IgM anti-CD3 mAb. CD3 expression was markedly modulated by this anti-CD3 mAb after the same period of incubation. Studies with cycloheximide revealed that Tm 1 expression on T cells does not require new protein synthesis. Tm 1 expression persisted long after CD3-reexpression 24 h later. Tm 1 was present on a small fraction of circulating T cells, B cells, and monocytes and absent from granulocytes, platelets, E, and thymocytes. Tm 1 was not expressed on T cells after various activation stimuli but was expressed on B cells upon activation. Additional studies indicate that IgM mAb against other T cell differentiation Ag and IgM mAb against B cell Ag also lead to the expression of Tm 1 on these cells.

This suggests that the mechanism of action of the fluoropyrimidines against these mouse and human cell lines is similar.

Although net 45Ca uptake reaches a plateau a few minutes after antigen stimulation, the increase in plasma membrane permeability is maintained for at least an hour, provided that receptors for IgE remain aggregated.

The authors have shown this drug induces myeloid differentiation of HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cells and is an effective agent in certain patients with chronic granulocytic leukemia. In order to investigate the mechanism by which this drug inhibits RNA synthesis we have compared the effect of mithramycin on RNA synthesis by whole cells, isolated nuclei, and RNA synthesis by isolated E. coli RNA polymerase and eukaryotic RNA polymerase II. Exposure of HL-60 cells to mithramycin at concentrations of 4.6 X 10(-7) m or higher for 48 hours causes an almost immediate inhibition of RNA synthesis (up to 85% at 4 hours) with only modest cytotoxicity at these concentrations. Endogenous RNA synthesis by isolated nuclei can be inhibited by mithramycin only at high concentrations (greater than 10(-5) m), suggesting that mithramycin primarily may inhibit initiation, rather than elongation. Mithramycin inhibits in vitro transcription of salmon sperm DNA by E. coli RNA polymerase at DNA:drug ratios similar to those required for RNA synthesis inhibition in whole cells. Similar DNA binding studies with synthetic oligonucleotides demonstrate that mithramycin is a potent inhibitor of transcription of Poly dG.dC by E. coli RNA polymerase but has no effect on transcription of Poly dA.dT. The rapid inhibition of whole cell and isolated RNA polymerase transcription, and the relative insensitivity of isolated nuclei, suggest mithramycin may interact with specific DNA sequences in order to inhibit the initiation of RNA synthesis in intact cells.",['1 RO1 CA 42664-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', 'EC 2.7.7.6 (DNA-Directed RNA Polymerases)', 'NIJ123W41V (Plicamycin)']",,,"['Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Alabama, Birmingham 35294.']",,,,

In contrast, cells induced by DMSO on fibronectin-coated dishes for 7 d differentiate into enucleating cells, reticulocytes, and erythrocytes. As determined by quantitative immunoblotting, cells induced in suspension culture accumulate approximately 33% of the amount of the major erythroid membrane protein Band 3 present in erythrocyte, whereas cells induced on fibronectin-coated dishes accumulate 80-100% of the amount present in erythrocytes. Both suspension-induced cells and cells induced on fibronectin-coated dishes accumulate approximately 90% of the amount of spectrin and ankyrin present in erythrocytes. As revealed by immunofluorescence microscopy during enucleation of MEL cells, both Band 3 and ankyrin are sequestered in the cytoplasmic fragment of the emerging reticulocyte.

We have measured cellular deformability to investigate the participation of cytoskeletal mechanical changes. Cross-linking cell-surface IgE-receptor complexes with multivalent ligands not only triggered secretion but also caused the cells to stiffen, i.e., to become more resistant to deformation. This mechanical response required receptor cross-linking, had a time course similar to that of secretion, and was reversed by DNP-L-lysine, a competitive inhibitor of antigen binding. Hence the same stimulus seems to elicit both stiffening and secretion. Cytochalasin D, which inhibits actin filament assembly, prevented or reversed stiffening, thereby implicating the cytoskeleton in the mechanical response. Increasing intracellular calcium ion concentration with the ionophore A23187 stiffened cells and stimulated secretion. Activation of protein kinase C with a phorbol ester also stiffened cells and enhanced both the stiffening and secretion caused by the ionophore. Yet cytochalasin D enhances secretion whereas activation of protein kinase c alone is insufficient for secretion. Therefore stiffening is neither necessary nor sufficient for secretion. These results characterize a cytoskeletal mechanical response triggered by the same receptor-dependent stimulus that elicits secretion and by second messengers that are thought to mediate between the receptor signal and secretion.

These coculture studies used fresh or cryopreserved marrow T lymphocytes with fresh or cryopreserved marrow T cell-depleted target cells. Four of five aplastic patients had little or no transfusion exposure before studies. The composite results showed that, in comparison to the erythropoietic effects of normal HLA-identical marrow T lymphocytes or engrafted T lymphocytes, T lymphocytes collected from the aplastic patients before BMT consistently suppressed or failed to support CFUE and BFUE growth optimally from autologous marrow, HLA-identical marrow, or engrafted aplastic T cell-depleted marrows. This T cell abnormality was not observed in four multiply transfused leukemics and three patients with myelodysplastic syndrome. Marker analyses of SAA marrow T lymphocytes performed before and after BMT suggested that the erythropoietic functional abnormality was due to abnormal marrow T cell composition reflecting an excess of activated Tac+, T3+, T11+ lymphocytes. Collectively, these in vitro studies provide firmer in vitro evidence implicating T cells in the pathogenesis of SAA.

Nine patients had acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL), nine patients had prolymphocytic leukaemia (PLL), six patients presented with a T-CLL/T-lymphocytosis syndrome, two patients had Sezary syndrome (SS) and one patient had HTLV-I positive T-cell leukaemia/lymphoma (ATLL). alpha TCR gene rearrangement could be demonstrated by the use of three available probes in only one case. By contrast, both beta and gamma TCR gene rearrangement could be demonstrated by Southern blot analysis of DNA samples digested with appropriate restriction enzymes in the majority of cases. In general, when rearrangements were present they involved both alleles. The proportion of rearranged chromosomes was lower in T-ALL than in other forms of T-cell leukaemia and it was lower in cases with the CD4-/CD8+ phenotype than in those with a CD4+/CD8- phenotype. In three out of 34 cases of B-cell leukaemia the TCR beta-gene but not the TCR gamma-gene was rearranged, just as in two out of 26 cases of T-cell leukaemia the immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy chain but not the light chain genes were rearranged. These data suggest that development of the machinery required for gene rearrangement may precede commitment to B or T cell lineage. The use of this technique is especially useful for the classification of cases of ALL in which the cells are negative with respect to most current phenotypic markers and in cases of T cell lymphocytosis in which the finding of a gene rearrangement identifies a monoclonal cell population.",,"['0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",,,"['Department of Haematology, Hammersmith Hospital, London.']",,,,

Comparisons were also made between responses in patients with haematological malignancies and those with solid tumours. Following extracellular volume expansion, clodronate induced a significant decrease in serum calcium within 2 days of the start of treatment which was maximal at 7 days. This was associated with a decrease in bone resorption as judged by decreases in urinary excretion of hydroxyproline and calcium. Hypercalcaemia recurred 5-7 days after stopping treatment. Patients with solid tumours had higher pretreatment serum calcium values than those with haematological malignancies despite comparable values for fasting urinary excretion of calcium suggesting that renal tubular reabsorption of calcium was more markedly increased in patients with solid tumours. No difference was observed in the final calcium values between patients with solid tumours and haematological malignancies except in those patients in whom renal tubular reabsorption of calcium was markedly increased before treatment. We conclude that intravenous clodronate provides a safe and effective treatment of hypercalcaemia due to a wide range of tumour types provided that increased bone resorption contributes significantly to the hypercalcaemia.

The binding of insolubilized CB04-S to CR1 gave a progression signal to B-CLL cells which became B cell growth factor (BCGF)-responsive. The cells of 13 of 14 cases treated with CB04-S showed an active time-dependent proliferation when BCGF was added to the culture. After 72 hr of exposure to BCGF, the growth fraction evaluated with the Ki67 monoclonal antibody was 23.4 +/- 8.9 and the proportion of cells in S phase assessed by the bromodeoxyuridine incorporation technique was 18.6 +/- 8.5%. The proper sequence of CB04-S followed by BCGF was also important since the proliferation was halved when the sequence was reversed or the two signals were delivered concomitantly. CB04-S and BCGF alone failed to induce any significant proliferation; the percentage of cycling cells was less than 1% overlapping that of control culture cells. On the contrary, the proliferation of normal tonsil B cells was triggered both by CB04-S and by BCGF used as single agents (bromodeoxyuridine+ cells 12.7 +/- 5.1% and 20.0 +/- 7.3, respectively).

No substantial alteration in IGF-I or -II binding occurred with induced HL60 cell differentiation. Insulin and IGF-I demonstrated cross competition for receptor binding and down-regulated their homologous receptors without detectable cross modulation of the heterologous receptors on HL60 cells. IGF-I and insulin increased HL60 cell proliferation, as assessed by 3H-thymidine uptake, IGF-I greater than insulin.

At the same time, these leukaemic cell populations were examined for the amounts of major histocompatibility complex Class I and Class II antigens they expressed, and their ability to release interleukin 1 (IL1) in culture both with and without stimulation by lipopolysaccharide. The abilities of the leukaemic cell populations to stimulate in MLC, and to produce IL1, were found to be associated with the expression of morphological characteristics of monocytic differentiation, and correlated significantly. In contrast, no correlation was observed between the extent of Class I or Class II expression and MLC stimulatory ability. Many myeloblast populations of immature phenotype were unable to stimulate allogeneic T cells despite their strong expression of these antigens. This lack of stimulatory ability was not overcome by the addition of exogenous IL1. We therefore conclude that the correlation between the production of IL1 and MLC stimulatory ability does not necessarily imply a cause/effect relationship, and that the interaction between allo-antigen and the T cell receptor together with a supply of lymphokine 'co-stimulator' is not sufficient to activate resting T lymphocytes. The failure of some Class I and II antigen positive leukaemic blasts to stimulate in MLC even in the presence of exogenous IL1 may be due to the lack of other differentiation-associated cell surface molecules necessary for stable cell-cell interaction.",,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (Interleukin-1)']",,,"['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Adelaide, South Australia.']",,,,

The experimental system we studied consisted of monovalent ligand, 2,4-dinitrophenyl (DNP)-aminocaproyl-L-tyrosine (DCT), binding to bivalent, monoclonal anti-DNP immunoglobulin E (IgE) anchored to its high affinity receptor on rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) cells. To measure the fractional occupation of antibody combining sites by DNP we employed a recently developed fluorescence technique (Erickson, J., Kane, B. Goldstein, D. Holowka, and B. Baird, 1986, Mol. Immunol., 72:769-781). Our results are well fitted by the equation (Berg and Purcell, 1977, Biophys. J., 20:193-219) konc = 4 pi DaN kappa on/[4 pi Da + N kappa on] where konc is the forward rate constant for binding to the cell, D is the diffusion constant of the ligand, a is the radius of the cell, and kappa on is the intrinsic forward rate constant describing a single IgE combining site-DNP interaction. If D is fixed at 10(-5) cm2/s, the best fit of accumulated data predicts an average cell radius of approximately 4 microns and kappa on of approximately 1.8 x 10(-13) cm3/s [1.1 x 10(8)(M . s)-1]; both in excellent agreement with RBL cell size and the single-site forward rate constant for the binding of DCT to IgE in solution, respectively. We believe this is the first report of experimental evidence that directly illustrates the effect of surface density in determining the rates of binding for small molecules to membrane receptors.","['AI18306/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'GM35556/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Fluoresceins)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Receptors, Drug)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '0 (Thiocyanates)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)', 'I223NX31W9 (Fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate)']",,PMC1330059,"['Department of Chemistry, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York 14853.']",,,,

In eight of the 25 leukemia samples, intracellular drug levels after exposure in vitro could also be measured. The intracellular levels of TMQ were 6 to 64 times higher than those of MTX, indicating that the difference in potency of these drugs may be related to the difference in intracellular accumulation. The intracellular levels of both agents varied widely and were not directly related to the degree of DNA synthesis inhibition. There was, however, a clear positive correlation between the intracellular ratio [TMQ]/[MTX] and the deoxyuridine incorporation after exposure to MTX.

When aggregated, these receptors induce cellular degranulation. The alpha chain of the receptor contains the binding site for IgE; the function(s) of the noncovalently associated beta and gamma chains is (are) still undefined. Using a cDNA library constructed from the mRNA of RBL cells, we have isolated a cDNA clone whose sequence predicts a putative 23-residue signal peptide, followed by a sequence that accurately predicts the amino acid composition, the peptide molecular weight, and six peptide sequences (encompassing 59 residues or 26% of the total number) determined for the alpha chain by direct analysis. These findings provide strong evidence that the cDNA codes for the alpha chain, even though expression has not been unambiguously achieved. The sequence suggests that the alpha chain contains a 180-residue extracellular portion with two homologous domains of approximately 35 residues, a 20-residue transmembrane segment containing an aspartic acid, and a 27-residue cytoplasmic portion containing 9 basic amino acids.

The immunophenotypes in all of the cases included in this study had been characterized previously in fresh-frozen sections or cell suspensions. Among 21 samples of B5-fixed SNC, LN-1 was reactive in 17 and LN-2 in 18 cases. Among 13 B5-fixed LBL, LN-1 was reactive in two cases and LN-2 was reactive in two cases. Each of 20 B5-fixed samples of SNC was reactive with at least one of the antibodies, whereas 10 of the 13 B5-fixed samples of LBL were negative for both antibodies. Lesser reactivity was evident in formalin-fixed tissues, with only nine of 27 SNC specimens positive for LN-1 and 16 of 27 positive for LN-2. Most or all of the SNC and LBL samples were negative for immunoglobulin light chains, Leu-M1, vimentin, S-100 protein, lysozyme, and alpha-1-antitrypsin.

Enhanced generation of tumor-specific in vivo protective immunity could be obtained by immunizing tumor cells coupling highly immunogenic additional antigens to hosts in which helper T cell activity against these antigens is already induced. MDP haptens newly synthesized exhibited cross-reactivity with BCG and functioned as appropriate tumor cell-modifying reagents in BCG-sensitized individuals. With the use of these new MDP haptens, the above approach for enhanced tumor immunity was successfully applied to tumor-specific immunotherapy models. When tumor-bearing hosts had been sensitized to BCG, the growth of tumor cells in a solid tumor mass or in metastasized or disseminated form were effectively inhibited by active immunization with MDP hapten-modified tumor cells. Thus, these results reinforce the theoretical framework of the approach for enhanced induction of tumor immunity.

We evaluated MTX pharmacokinetics and toxicity in five patients with Down syndrome and ALL who had received multiple high doses of MTX (1 g/m2). Three control patients without Down syndrome were matched to each case according to sex, race, age, and initial leukocyte count. Median MTX plasma concentrations, measured 42 hours after infusion, were significantly higher in patients with Down syndrome versus control patients (average 0.47 vs 0.24 mumol/L, respectively, P = 0.03). When a 42-hour MTX concentration of 0.5 mumol/L was used to identify patients at risk for toxicity, more courses were considered at high risk for toxicity among patients with Down syndrome (31 of 62, 50%) than in control patients (13 of 214, 6.1%, P less than 0.0001). The average MTX clearance was 64.1 mL/min/m2 in Down syndrome vs an average control value of 80.6 mL/min/m2 (P = 0.13). Toxicity after each high-dose MTX course was graded according to standardized criteria. Grades 2 through 4 gastrointestinal toxicity and grades 3 and 4 hematologic toxicity occurred more frequently in the patients with Down syndrome (36% and 13.4% of courses, respectively) vs the control patients (3.6% and 0.9% respectively, P less than 0.0001 for both). This higher frequency of toxicity occurred despite higher doses and prolonged duration of leucovorin given to all patients with Down syndrome.

Hybrid molecules were constructed from both mouse monoclonal and rabbit polyclonal antibodies with equal efficiency, in the combinations mouse-rabbit and mouse-mouse. Peptic F(ab' gamma)2 fragments from the two chosen antibodies were first reduced to provide Fab' gamma SH. The SH groups on one of the Fab' gamma SH partners were then fully alkylated with o-phenylenedi-maleimide to provide free maleimide groups. Finally the two preparations, Fab' gamma mal and Fab' gamma SH, combined under conditions which allowed cross-linking of the maleimide and SH groups and avoided reoxidation of SH groups. The major product isolated from the reaction mixture after chromatography was always the F(ab' gamma)2 heterodimer (50 to 70%), other products being unreacted Fab' gamma and trace amounts of putative F(ab' gamma)3. Immunochemical analysis revealed that the thioether-linked F(ab' gamma)2 molecules were essentially all heterodimers, most of which had been joined via their Fd chains. The dual specificity of F(ab' gamma)2 heterodimers was tested functionally in three systems: 1) the combination (anti-idiotype + anti-phycoerythrin) linked L2C cells to the fluorochrome phycoerythrin, allowing fluorescence analysis; 2) the combination (anti-idiotype + anti-saporin) linked L2C cells to the ribosome-inactivating protein saporin, and transformed a subtoxic dose of saporin into a highly toxic mixture which prevented further protein synthesis by L2C cells; and 3) the combination of anti-idiotype with 3G8 (antibody to the Fc gamma receptor CD16) subjected L2C cells to cytotoxic attack by human mononuclear effectors.",,"['0 (Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Fab Fragments)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)', '0 (Receptors, IgG)', '0 (anti-IgM)']",,,"['Lymphoma Research Unit, Tenovus Laboratory, General Hospital, Southampton, United Kingdom.']",,,,

Synergistic inhibitory effects on cell growth were obtained when exponentially growing CCRF-CEM cells were exposed to 5-CH3-H4PteGlu (1-100 microM) for 4 hr and to FUra (250 microM) or FdUrd (0.5 microM) during the last 2 hr.

No clear dependence of synergism on sequence was observed with FUra and 5-CH3-H4PteGlu combinations (5-CH3-H4PteGlu----FUra,5-CH3-H4PteGlu + FUra, or FUra----5-CH3-H4PteGlu).

The results are consistent with the hypothesis that the mechanism by which 5-CH3-H4PteGlu potentiates fluoropyrimidine cytotoxicity is the enhancement of complex formation between thymidylate synthase and 5-fluorodeoxyuridylate, as a consequence of an increase of intracellular levels of 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate generated from 5-CH3-H4PteGlu.

All IFN-gamma actions are initiated by binding to high affinity cell surface receptors, which are constitutively expressed in virtually all cell lines from various tissues. Although the detailed structure of the IFN-gamma receptor is still elusive, the available data suggest that the high affinity IFN-gamma binding site is a heterodimeric molecule of 128 kDa comprised of two subunits of 53 and 75 kDa, which is invariantly expressed in distinct tumor cells, differing in their response to IFN-gamma. Thus, the capability and type of cellular response to IFN-gamma appears to be largely determined at a post-receptor level. Nevertheless, in sensitive cell lines, the magnitude of response is proportional to the quantity of receptor ligand interactions. This could be important for the definition of effective doses in clinical applications of IFN-gamma, as distinct tumor cells are heterogeneous with respect to quantity of IFN-gamma receptors, with greater 20-fold differences of the number of receptors per cell.",,"['0 (Affinity Labels)', '0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Interferon)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",,,,,,,

Moreover, on surface-iodinated CEM cells no association of T3 and TCR molecules could be demonstrated after treatment with PMA, and expression of TCR alpha and beta chains was limited to the cytoplasm.

Thirty patients who received a total of 33 courses were evaluable for toxicity, including 19 who were evaluable for hematological toxicity.

Other side effects observed included transient, mild elevations of serum transaminases, mild nausea and vomiting, and a local phlebitis at the site of injection at higher dose levels. A single patient with delayed drug clearance had evidence of renal toxicity with a transient increase in serum creatinine. The pharmacokinetics of trimetrexate were studied in 25 patients over the entire dose range. There was considerable interpatient variability in total drug clearance (range 9.2 to 215 ml/min/m2) and half-life (2.1 to 20 h). There was a suggestion of a correlation between plasma concentration at 24 h and the development of hematological toxicity at the highest dose level.

In cALL, CD10 density was inversely correlated with CLA and Cmu expression and strongly correlated with CD34 expression as in cBML. In contrast to cBML, TdT and CD20 expression were not related to CD10 density in cALL. Furthermore, cALL TdT intensity measured by enzyme immunoassay was not related to expression of CD10, CLA, or CD34, but was positively correlated with CD20 expression. Cmu expression in cALL was inversely correlated with expression of CD34 and positively correlated with CLA as in cBML, but showed no association with TdT intensity or CD20 expression in contrast to the relationship found in cBMLs. Analysis of TdT intensity and Cmu expression in sorted subpopulations of cells from individual patients that were positive or negative for CD34, CD20, or CD10 was consistent with the data obtained by comparison of cells from different patients. These results indicate that from patient to patient and within individual patients, cALL cells express the markers CD34, CLA, CD10, and Cmu in a coordinated fashion similar to cBMLs, but demonstrate differences in expression of TdT and CD20 with respect to the marrow cells considered their normal counterparts. The cALL cells that are CD34 positive show increased expression of CD10 and are less likely to be CLA or Cmu positive, suggesting that they may represent a phenotypically less differentiated form of cALL than does CD34-negative cALL.",['CA 39569/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', 'EC 2.- (Transferases)', 'EC 3.4.24.11 (Neprilysin)']",,,,,,,

In experiments using intact cells and isolated Fc gamma receptors, it was demonstrated that bovine IgG can bind to Fc gamma receptors of four human cell types but not to Fc gamma receptors of human neutrophils. 125I-labeled Fc gamma receptors purified on human IgG-Sepharose columns from human B and T lymphocytes, monocytes and eosinophils were able to rebind specifically to insolubilized bovine IgG. In contrast, radioiodinated human neutrophil Fc gamma receptors did not rebind to bovine IgG-Sepharose. A similar pattern of specificity was demonstrated in studies of the binding of 125I-labeled heat-aggregated bovine IgG to various human leukocyte populations. The labeled aggregated bovine IgG bound to peripheral blood mononuclear cells, to B cells from chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients and to macrophage-like U-937 cells, but bound poorly to normal human granulocytes. Labeled non-aggregated bovine IgG was not appreciably bound to any of the cell populations. Since bovine IgG in dietary sources is frequently exposed to heat, the effect of heating on the physical state and Fc-binding properties of bovine IgG was examined. The data show that heating bovine IgG at concns of 0.9-3.6 mg/ml at 63 degrees C for 30 min in neutral buffer causes aggregation of bovine immunoglobulin (10-16% aggregation) and increases the ability of bovine IgG preparations to bind to human Fc gamma receptors of intact cells.

Whereas the Ba F3 cell line, which has both immunoglobulin heavy- and light-chain genes in germline configuration, interacts with the arg-gly-asp-containing cell-binding domain of fibronectin, the B-committed line PD 31, which is undergoing rearrangement of immunoglobulin light-chain genes, does not. Accordingly the Ba F3, but not the putative PD 31 surface fibronectin receptor, binds to an affinity matrix containing the 115-kD cell-binding domain of fibronectin. PD 31 cells recognize a different domain of the fibronectin molecule, which is contained within the carboxy terminal segment possessing a high-affinity binding site for heparin. A polyclonal antibody raised against the fibronectin receptor of mouse erythroleukemic cells inhibits adhesion of these lymphoid lines to fibronectin.

Multiple studies have established the incidence of leukemia in Down's syndrome patients to be 10- to 20-fold higher than that in the general population. The age of onset for leukemia in these children is bimodal, peaking first in the newborn period and again at 3-6 years. This increased risk extends into adulthood. All cytogenetic types of Down's syndrome apparently predispose to leukemia. The proportion of acute lymphoblastic leukemia and acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia in patients with Down's syndrome is similar to non-Down's syndrome leukemia patients matched for age. There are case reports in which leukemia, Down's syndrome, and other chromosomal aberrations cluster within a family. In these kindreds, there may be a familial tendency toward nondisjunction. Congenital leukemia also occurs with increased frequency in Down's syndrome patients, and is characterized by a preponderance of acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia (similar to non-Down's syndrome patients). Transient leukemoid reactions have been observed in Down's syndrome patients, as well as in phenotypically normal children with constitutional trisomy 21 mosaicism. The transient leukemoid reactions are characterized by a high spontaneous remission rate. However, in some Downs syndrome patients with apparent transient leukemoid reaction, leukemia relapse following periods of spontaneous remission have been reported. Cytogenetic studies of leukemic cells in Down's syndrome patients show a tendency toward hyperdiploidy. Besides trisomy 21, there is no other specific cytogenetic abnormality that is characteristic of the leukemia cells in Down's syndrome patients. The possible mechanisms for leukemogenesis in Down's syndrome patients may involve factors at the levels of the organism, the organ/system, the cell, the chromosomes or the DNA.","['KO4-CA01027/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA39771/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,

The frequent appearance of multiple stem cell lines with common and/or overlapping chromosomal aberrations in acute leukemia cases demonstrates the existence of genomic instability and heterogeneity of the neoplastic cell population, which results from clonal chromosomal evolution. Furthermore, trisomy 19 was identified only with the concurrent presence of trisomy 8, suggesting that the nondisjunction of chromosome #19 probably occurred after that of #8. Trisomy 21 was observed in every aneuploid stem cell line and, in one case, trisomy 21 was maintained in the bone marrow leukemic cells but not in the orbital rhabdomyosarcoma cells, indicating that this constitutional chromosomal aberration is probably crucial for and predisposed to the development of acute leukemia in DS patients.

Equal doses of MC-540 (15 to 20 micrograms/mL) could preferentially eliminate tumor cells under conditions of simultaneous light and drug treatment (30 minutes at 37 degrees C). When using DHE (2.5 micrograms/mL), 29.3%, 46.8%, and 27.5% of normal marrow CFU-GM, BFU-E, and CFU-GEMM, respectively, were spared after sequential drug and light exposure of cells, whereas simultaneous treatment reduced both normal (CFU-GM) and neoplastic cells below the limits of detection. In summary, our results indicate the usefulness of various photoradiation models for the ex vivo treatment of leukemic and lymphomatous bone marrow autografts.","['CA-08748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-19117/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-20194/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Hematoporphyrins)', '0 (Pyrimidinones)', '0 (Radiation-Sensitizing Agents)', '58823-12-4 (merocyanine dye)', '97067-70-4 (Dihematoporphyrin Ether)']",,,,,,,

Experiments were performed to determine if sera, monocytes, or non-T cells from patients with CLL suppress the proliferative response and synthesis of immunoglobulin (Ig) following incubation with pokeweed mitogen (PWM) in cocultures with lymphocytes from normal individuals. The data indicate that sera and monocytes from patients with CLL did not suppress the proliferative response or synthesis of Ig normal non-T cells. When various numbers of normal non-T cells and CLL non-T cells were cocultured with a constant number of normal T cells, the proliferative response and the concentration of supernatant Ig decreased as the proportion of CLL non-T cells increased. Since similar results were obtained when irradiated non-T cells from normal individuals were substituted for non-T cells from patients with CLL, we believe that the decrease in proliferative response and diminished synthesis of Ig is not the result of the suppressor non-T cells but is related to the dilution of normal B cells by inert non-T cells.

Rearranged gamma- and beta-chain genes were found in all T-cell ALLs (22/22) examined. Overall, 27% (18/66) of B-lineage ALLs had beta-chain gene rearrangements, and 41% (24/58) had gamma-chain gene rearrangements, but the distribution of rearranged genes varied according to the stage of B-cell differentiation. The gamma-chain genes were rearranged in 11% (1/9) of the B-lineage patients negative for the common acute lymphoblastic leukemia antigen (cALLA) and 50% (23/46) of cALLA+ ALL patients, while the beta-chain genes were not rearranged in any of the 7 cALLA- ALL patients examined but were rearranged in 32% (18/56) of the cALLA+ patients. Neither TCR gene was found to be rearranged in acute nonlymphoid leukemia patients (0/12) or in patients with B-cell (surface immunoglobulin-positive) leukemia (0/3). Of the 44 cALLA+ patients in which a direct comparison of gamma- and beta-chain gene rearrangements could be made, 34% had both genes rearranged, 16% had only gamma-chain gene rearrangements, and the remaining 50% had both genes in the germ-line configuration. beta-Chain rearrangements have not been found in the absence of gamma-chain rearrangements, thus supporting a proposed hierarchy of TCR gene rearrangements. A provocative finding was that only a small percentage (11%) of the patients with cALLA- B precursor cell ALLs had rearranged TCR genes, while 50% of the cALLA+ leukemia patients had at least gamma-chain rearrangement, raising a question as to whether indeed cALLA- cells are precursors to cALLA+ cells. Interestingly, 18% (2/11) of the cytoplasmic immunoglobulin (cIg)-positive cALLA+ (pre-B) ALLs involved TCR gene rearrangements, compared to 60% (21/35) of the cIg-negative cases, suggesting the possibility that the majority of functional B cells are derived from the cALLA+ pool that contains immunoglobulin but not TCR gene rearrangements.","['CA20180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta)', 'EC 3.4.24.11 (Neprilysin)']",,PMC305127,,,,,

After positive selection of cell subsets using a fluorescence-activated cell sorter, these two activities were produced by OKT4+ lymphocytes, whereas OKT8+ cells displayed small amounts of CSA and were incapable of releasing suppressor activity. On the other hand, total human thymocytes and subsets defined by monoclonal antibodies Leu2a/Leu3a failed to express any detectable CSA or CFU-C suppressor activity. A total of 14 cases of phenotyped lymphoid malignancies were also studied: the results showed that the production of stimulating and/or inhibiting factors is neither clearly related to a discrete stage of differentiation nor to the OKT4/OKT8 phenotype. Moreover, three monoclonal T leukemias, OKT4+OKT8-, OKT4-OKT8-, and OKT4-OKT8+ have been able in each case to produce simultaneously CSA and CFU-C suppressor activity.

Results showed that this group of lymphomas have significant immunologic heterogeneity. Of the 36 cases, 33 were positive for T-cell antigens; among these, 22 cases were classified as T-cell LBL (TLBL, Group 1) based on their expression of T-cell-restricted and T-cell-associated antigens, and five expressed the common acute lymphoblastic leukemia antigen in addition to T-cell-associated antigens (Group 2). Six cases showed strong reactivity with anti-Leu-11 antibody, which defines a specific subtype of lymphocytes considered to have a natural killer (NK) function (Group 3). Two additional cases had a ""pre-B"" cell phenotype (Group 4), as determined by reactivity with BA-1 and BA-2 monoclonal antibodies, which react with immature and pre-B-lymphocytes. The neoplastic cells in the remaining case showed monoclonal surface membrane immunoglobulin of the IgMD heavy chain and kappa light chain type (Group 5). Despite immunophenotypic heterogeneity, the morphologic features were essentially similar in all cases. When the clinical features for each immunologic group were compared, however, two statistically significant findings resulted: (1) the frequency of mediastinal masses was highest in TLBL (Group 1, P less than 0.01), and (2) the male-female ratio was significantly lower in patients with LBL expressing NK-associated antigens (Group 3) than in the other groups of patients (P less than 0.01). Our data indicate that LBL can be divided into several immunologic subtypes; larger, prospective clinicopathologic studies are required to determine the clinical significance of the immunophenotypic classifications of LBL.","['CA-09308/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-16434/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-26422/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)', 'EC 3.4.24.11 (Neprilysin)']",,,,,,,

An additional trisomy involving chromosome 22 was detected in blast cells from one patient. Blood and marrow cells colony-assays performed at diagnosis revealed precursors with an abnormal differentiation capacity similar to those found in acute myelogenous leukaemia colony assays. However, an unusual feature was the persistence of high numbers of precursor cells (namely erythroid) following a normal differentiation pathway. Phenotypically and cytogenetically abnormal cells spontaneously disappeared by week 4-6, but overt relapse occurred in one patient 20 months later. These results bring strong arguments in favour of the neoplastic nature of the transient leukaemic picture observed in some neonates with Down's syndrome.

Hence, the Ca2+-requirement of the NK cytotoxic reaction seems to be due to an essential Ca2+-influx into the target cell.",,"['FF28EJQ494 (Promethazine)', 'I9ZF7L6G2L (Nifedipine)']",,,,,,,

The conditioning regimen consisted of cytoxan 60 mg/kg X 2 and 10 Gy total body irradiation. To prevent graft-versus-host disease, 75% of the patients were given methotrexate and 25%, cyclosporine A. The probability of remaining in complete remission was 61% at 5 years. The probability of survival was 43% at 5 years, with a plateau between 2.5 and 6 years. The most frequent causes of death were interstitial pneumonia, relapses and graft-versus-host disease. Relapses were more frequent in cases with M 4-5 cytology than in those with M1 to M3 cytology (P less than 0.01). Transplant-related deaths were mainly consecutive to graft-versus-host disease and its facilitating effect on pneumonia (P less than 0.05). These results indicate that bone marrow transplantation can cure a large proportion of patients with acute myelogenous leukaemia, especially AML subtypes without monocytic differentiation. Improvements in conditioning regimens for the M 4-5 subtypes and in prevention of graft-versus-host reaction and cytomegalovirus infection should give rise to further developments in this field.",,,,,,Greffes de moelle allogeniques dans les leucemies aigues myeloides.

Microscopic and cell sorter analysis of cells isolated from a series of fresh normal tonsils have identified a subpopulation of normal B cells carrying the same cell surface markers.

The anti-idiotype antibodies (Ab2) were made against the paratope of a monoclonal antitumor antibody (11C1) that recognizes a tumor-associated antigen which cross-reacts with the mouse mammary tumor virus-encoded envelope glycoprotein 52. Two Ab2, 2F10 and 3A4, induced idiotypes expressed by the monoclonal antitumor antibodies 11C1 and 2B2. Cytotoxic T cells, generated by immunization with irradiated tumor cells, lyse 2F10 and 3A4 hybridoma cells. Furthermore, immunization with Ab2 induces tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes. The frequency of tumor-reactive cytotoxic T lymphocyte was found to be similar in mice immunized with Ab2 or irradiated tumor cells when examined at the precursor level. However, only 2F10 induces protective immunity against the growth of L1210/GZL tumor cells. The depletion of a L3T4+ T cell population from 2F10 immune mice was found to increase the effectiveness of transferred T cells to induce inhibition of tumor growth. The inability of 3A4 to induce antitumor immunity could be correlated with the presence of a population of Lyt2+ regulatory T cells. Collectively, these results demonstrate the existence of a regulatory network controlling the expression of effective tumor immunity. Our results demonstrate that selection of binding site-related Ab2 may not be a sufficient criteria for the development of an idiotype vaccine. A better understanding of the regulatory interactions induced by anti-idiotypes is needed for the design of effective antitumor immunotherapy.",['CA26479/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Idiotypes)', '0 (Vaccines)']",,,,,,,

Immunofluorescence analysis on the original leukemic cells indicated the presence of T cell markers (Leu-1, Tdt, and T11); however, the established TALL-101 cell line expressed only antigens commonly present on progenitor cells, thymocytes, and myelomonocytic cells, but not on mature T cells. A high percentage of TALL-101 cells displayed the Tac antigen which was down-regulated upon incubation in the presence of recombinant human (rH) interleukin 2 (IL 2). Interferon (IFN)-gamma induced the appearance of class II histocompatibility leukocyte antigens (HLA) and of a T cell marker (3A1), and enhanced the expression of transferrin receptors on these cells. Further evidence for a T cell lineage of the TALL-101 cell line was provided by both chromosomic and genotypic analysis showing a translocation in chromosome 14 typical of T cell leukemias, and a rearrangement of the T-beta receptor locus. The growth-promoting activity in the J-LB1-CM was identified as granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulatory factor (GM-CSF), a growth factor which stimulates proliferation of normal myelomonocytic cells and other progenitor cells, but not known to have an effect on T cells. Dose response curves of [3H]thymidine incorporation and growth indicated that TALL-101 cells were sensitive to very low concentrations of rHGM-CSF, 5 ng/ml inducing maximal proliferation in chemically defined medium. The TALL-101 cell line is strictly GM-CSF-dependent for growth: upon depletion of GM-CSF from the culture medium, the cells stop proliferating immediately and die within 1 to 2 wk. The overall data, showing that GM-CSF is able to support the growth of a highly undifferentiated T cell leukemia, strongly suggests that this factor might have similar growth promoting effects on other immature T cell leukemias, and possibly, on normal T cell progenitors.","['CA 10815/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 25875/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'NS-11036/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']","['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",,,,,,,

Upon reduction, these fragments yield 67-kDa and 55-kDa epsilon chain-derived polypeptides.

In the absence of mycoplasma, the IgE remains relatively intact throughout the same time period with a molecular mass of 210 kDa.

Whether this advance will be translated into improved patient survival is unclear at present, mainly because these procedures increase the risk of graft failure. Since 1983 we have transplanted 25 consecutive leukemia patients with HLA-identical sibling grafts purged of T cells by a single incubation with the monoclonal antibody Campath-1 and donor complement. This approach was successful in reducing T cell contamination of the graft and preventing acute and chronic GVHD. In this group of patients two suffered irreversible graft failure and one developed reversible graft failure. In a similarly sized group of patients previously transplanted with unpurged marrow according to the Seattle protocol, no episodes of graft failure occurred. Since other causes of graft failure, such as drug toxicity or viral infections, could be largely excluded, this suggested that the graft failures were specifically related to the purging process. In haploidentical bone marrow transplantation (BMT) O'Reilly has identified residual host-versus-graft activity (HVG) as a cause of graft failure. The causes and mechanisms of graft failure in T-depleted HLA-identical sibling transplants have not been extensively investigated to date. In the three graft failures observed by us, the loss of the graft was preceded by the appearance of a population of activated lymphocytes. We have determined the phenotype and origin of this population and investigated its interactions with donor hemopoietic tissue in vitro.",,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (HLA Antigens)']",,,,,,,

Consequently, the malignant clone can involve all cells within the stem cell's capacity for differentiation, including erythrocytes, granulocytes, monocytes, megakaryocytes, and lymphocytes. Similarly, the K562 cell line, which was derived from a patient with CML, has been shown to be capable of differentiation towards erythrocytes, granulocytes, monocytes, and megakaryocytes, and in this respect may represent a model of the hemopoietic stem cell. However, although K562 shows properties of a myeloid stem cell, no lymphocyte-specific features or differentiation have yet been described. In the present study, K562 cells have been induced to differentiate by culture in the presence of sodium butyrate. The direction and extent of induced differentiation over 12 days were determined with a panel of monoclonal antibodies and with cytochemical stains. This treatment consistently induced expression of pre-B-cell markers, including B-lymphocyte-specific B4 and B1, and of the common acute lymphoblastic leukemia antigen (CALLA), recognized by J5. In addition to the increased expression of B-lymphocyte markers, butyrate induction of K562 resulted in a decrease in granulocyte markers, increases in certain monocyte and platelet markers, and an increase in beta 2 microglobulin expression.

Following 200 rad of gamma-radiation (1 rad = 0.01 Gy), cells were treated with monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) directed to T3, Ti, T44, or T11 antigen and complement. After growth of the residual cells in culture, ""negative"" cells were cloned under limiting conditions. Depending on the specificity of the mAb used for the immunoselection, three groups of variants were obtained. (i) The use of mAbs directed to T3 or Ti resulted in cell variants that expressed the T3 Ti- T44+ Leu1+ T11+ T40+ 4F2+ HLA class I+ surface phenotype. (ii) Immunoselection with anti-T44 mAb resulted in 2 variants that shared the T3- Ti- T44- Leu1- T11+ T40+ 4F2+ HLA class I+ phenotype. (iii) Cell treatment with anti-T11 mAb resulted in 15 variants characterized by the lack of T11 antigen expression and of all the other T-cell-specific surface antigens. Therefore, it appears that the different sets of JA3 cell variants, like T cells at discrete stages of intrathymic differentiation, may follow a coordinated expression of surface differentiation antigens. Analysis of the functional responsiveness of the three distinct groups of JA3 cell variants to different stimuli showed that all produced interleukin 2 in response to A23187 calcium ionophore plus phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. The first group of variants (T3- Ti-) did not respond to stimulation with anti-T3, anti-Ti, or anti-T44 mAbs.

Transient myeloproliferative disorder is well recognized in neonates with a complete or mosaic trisomy 21 (Down's syndrome). We report a phenotypically and cytogenetically normal infant with this syndrome in whom only blast cells showed trisomy 21. We postulate that the pathogenesis of the transient myeloproliferative disorder in both Down's syndrome infants and those with a normal chromosomal complement is related to abnormal prenatal production of placental regulatory hemopoietic factors caused by chromosomal defect(s) confined to placental tissues.,,,,,,,,,

Conversely, the TRG gamma were seen in germline configuration in all 19 cases of B chronic lymphoid malignancies. In none of the 9 AML cases studied was TRG gamma and TCR beta chain gene rearrangement found. The TCR beta chain genes were rearranged in one B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).

In none of the 13 B-lineage ALL cases investigated by Northern analysis was TCR beta mRNA expression detected, whereas a weak expression of TRG gamma transcripts was found in two of these cases.

The mice thus survived for long times (more than 60 days), whereas the normal control injected with L1210 alone died within 14 days.

All of eight tumor clones established from L1210-K7L- by limiting dilution was insensitive to the antitumor activity of K7L, and this property of tumor clones was stable after repeated in vitro passage. The initial depression of the L1210 growth by K7L followed by growth and rejection of the variant L1210-K7L- by the host T cell activity was then found to prepare a strong, long-lasting (more than 3 mo) immunity to protect mice against the high-dose (10(7) cells per mouse) challenge of original L1210. Corresponding to this result, definite tumor (L1210)-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) activity against both variant and original L1210 targets was developed by antigen (L1210) restimulation in the culture of spleen cells from these mice, but was not increased to a detectable level before L1210-K7L- variant started to grow. It was suggested that the 1210-K7L- variant and the original L1210 should have the common tumor-specific antigen that was independent of the K7L-reactive antigen, and that original L1210, whose growth was retarded by K7L, primed the host with the common antigen to be enormously boosted by the subsequently growing L1210-K7L- variant.",,"['0 (Antigens, Ly)']",,,,,,,

Exposure of CCRF-CEM cells in exponential growth to LV (1-100 microM) for 4 hours and to FUra (100 microM) or FdUrd (0.5 microM) during the last 2 hours resulted in synergistic inhibitory effects on cell growth. Synergism was dependent on LV dose (100 greater than 10 greater than 1 microM) and did not occur at 0.1 microM. No clear dependence of synergy on sequence was observed with FUra and LV combinations. With LV and FdUrd combinations, synergism was dependent on sequence of exposure (LV + FdUrd and LV----FdUrd were synergistic, but FdUrd----LV was not). Thymidine (0.1 microM), added after drug treatment, substantially rescued CCRF-CEM cells from LV----FUra cytotoxicity. Concomitant hypoxanthine (100 microM) only partially protected CCRF-CEM cells from the toxicity of this combination. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the mechanism by which LV potentiates fluoropyrimidine cytotoxicity is the enhancement of complex formation between thymidylate synthase and 5-fluorodeoxyuridylate, presumably as a consequence of an increase of intracellular levels of 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate generated from LV. Also, enhanced stability of this complex in the presence of high levels of the folate coenzyme may contribute to the synergy observed.

Antigen-stimulated 45Ca uptake and the rise in cytoplasmic free ionized calcium measured with the fluorescent indicator quin2 were both inhibited in depolarized cells. 45Ca efflux, on the other hand, was unaffected, which confirms that IgE receptor activation was not impaired in high potassium. Unlike the large increase in total cell calcium seen when cells in normal saline solution were stimulated with antigen, there was a decrease in total cell calcium when depolarized cells were stimulated. This is consistent with our finding that 45Ca uptake was inhibited while 45Ca efflux was unaffected. Inhibition of 45Ca uptake and secretion closely paralleled the decrease in membrane potential, and could be overcome by increasing the extracellular calcium concentration.

Platelet mitogenic activity and beta TG content were significantly decreased in the patients as compared to the control subjects. The nine patients who were treated with recombinant human interferon (IFN alpha A) were restudied after 4 months of therapy. The levels of both mitogenic activity and beta TG platelet content were significantly increased after IFN alpha-treatment with a complete response in five of the nine treated patients, a partial response in two and no response in the two others. HCL seemed therefore to be responsible for an acquired platelet alpha granule defect.

Immunological investigations suggested an immune complex-mediated hypersensitivity reaction to insulin. The later development of immune complex-mediated arthropathy tended to support this suggestion. The lack of histological and immunological evidence of an IgE-mediated reaction suggested that in this case the mechanism of insulin allergy and arthralgia was IgG mediated.

Depolarization of the mitochondria with metabolic inhibitors was not detected by bis-oxonol, suggesting that only potential changes across the plasma membrane were being measured. The resting membrane potential of RBL cells was largely generated by the equilibrium distribution of K+ and not through electrogenic activity of the sodium pump. Depolarization was maintained as long as IgE receptors remained aggregated. We believe that at physiologic calcium concentrations a large portion of the measured potential change may be due to calcium influx across the plasma membrane. Prevention of calcium influx by lanthanum, disruption of aggregated receptors, or prior depolarization in a high K+ saline solution completely inhibited the antigen-induced depolarization. The time course of the antigen-stimulated increase in bis-oxonol fluorescence was similar, but not identical, to the antigen-stimulated rise in cytoplasmic free ionized calcium measured with fura-2. Antigen-stimulated depolarization was inhibited by removing both calcium and sodium and could be restored by the addition of either ion.

A novel approach is described which involves an assessment of the metabolism of and biosynthetic flux of the one-carbon moiety from (6S)5-formyltetrahydrofolate in folate-depleted cells. Pretreatment with methotrexate (10 microM), resulting in the formation of methotrexate polyglutamates, or continuous incubation with trimetrexate (1 microM) inhibited growth of folate-depleted L1210 cells in the presence of folic acid or 5-formyltetrahydrolate. In both control and drug-treated cells, double-labeled (6S)-5-[14C]formyl[3H]tetrahydrofolate was rapidly metabolized with the loss of the [14C]formyl group. Under all conditions, the predominant metabolite was 10-formyl[3H]tetrahydrofolate, detectable both intracellularly and extracellularly. In drug-treated cells, there was a remarkably small decrease in the level of 10-formyl[3H]tetrahydrofolate (approximately 30%) and a 10-fold rise in the level of [3H]dihydrofolate to less than 20% of the total folate pool. The incorporation of [14C]formyl group from 5-[14C]formyltetrahydrofolate into thymidylate, serine, and methionine was unaffected by the presence of 1 microM trimetrexate, consistent with the generation of sufficient 5,10-[14C]methylenetetrahydrofolate to drive these reactions. Similarly, the presence of methotrexate polyglutamates had no effect at the level of amino acid synthesis; however, carbon transfer into thymidylate was markedly inhibited. Even though 10-formyltetrahydrofolate was readily formed from 5-formyltetrahydrofolate in this model, the net incorporation of 14C from 5-[14C]formyltetrahydrofolate into purine nucleotides was inhibited by both methotrexate and trimetrexate treatments. Similar findings were obtained when [14C]glycine incorporation into purine nucleotides was monitored in cells incubated with unlabeled 5-formyltetrahydrofolate. Finally, in antifolate-treated cells incubated with unlabeled 5-formyl-tetrahydrofolate, transfer of 14C from [14C]formate or [14C]serine into biosynthetic products or incorporation of [3H]deoxyuridine into nucleic acids was potently inhibited. These results suggest that insufficient levels of tetrahydrofolate and 5, 10-methylenetetrahydrofolate were formed to drive these reactions despite the presence of high levels of 10-formyltetrahydrofolate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['CA-16906/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-39807/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['039LU44I5M (Floxuridine)', '935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)', 'K72T3FS567 (Adenosine)', 'Q573I9DVLP (Leucovorin)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",,,,,,,

The cytostatic action of IL 1 was not associated with cytotoxicity and appeared to be irreversible. Changes in the expression of surface antigens, like a rapid decrease of transferrin receptors or, more delayed, an increase in HLA-A, B, C antigen density suggested that a differentiation step was induced by IL 1. This effect of IL 1 was a direct one and most likely mediated by a specific receptor molecule. In order to characterize the receptor for IL 1, highly purified plasma membranes from K 562 were incubated with murine IL 1, and the phosphorylation pattern of plasma membrane proteins was investigated by the addition of radiolabeled ATP. At 0 degree C, IL 1 induced the specific phosphorylation of a 41 kDa membrane protein in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Analysis of the phosphoamino acid composition revealed that IL 1 induced specifically the phosphorylation of tyrosine residues of the 41 kDa protein. Crosslinking experiments proved that the 41 kDa protein had an IL 1 binding site, strongly suggesting that the 41 kDa protein was the receptor for IL 1 itself. Affinity labeling with an ATP-analogue showed that this protein possessed an ATP binding and cleaving site. We conclude from this that the receptor for IL 1 in the plasma membranes of K 562 is a transmembranous protein of 41 kDa, which possesses a tyrosine specific protein kinase activity with an autophosphorylating capacity.",,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-1)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",,,,,,,

The possibility that retroviral insertions into the mouse genome resulted in gain or loss mutations at non-H-2 histocompatibility loci was investigated by reciprocal skin grafting between Mov mice and mice from coisogenic, background strains. Two B6-derived and eight 129-derived Mov strains were analyzed. B6 mice rejected skin from the viremic Mov-3 and Mov-14 strains, indicating that these mice had new histocompatibility antigens. No rejections were observed with reciprocal skin grafts exchanged between mice of the 129 background strain and 129-derived Mov strains, one of which (Mov-9) is viremic. To investigate the potential viral origin of the new histocompatibility antigen in Mov-14, lymphocytes from B6 mice primed in vivo with Mov-14 cells or skin were restimulated in vitro with Mov-14 spleen cells and with two retroviral-induced B6 lymphomas, MBL-2 and RBL-5. All three cell types stimulated cytotoxic lymphocytes that lysed Mov-14 Con A lymphoblasts, MBL-2 and RBL-5. The same cytotoxic lymphocytes lysed only lymphoblasts from the viremic Mov-9 strain when tested on cells from 129 and 129 Mov mice. Thus the insertion and expression of exogenous Moloney murine leukemia virus results in the appearance of a new histocompatibility antigen as defined by its stimulation of skin-graft rejection and cytotoxic effector T-cell generation. The non-H-2 histocompatibility antigen identified in this study has been designated H-43 and is encoded by genes mapping to different loci in different Mov strains. These observations suggest that at least a subgroup of non-H-2 histocompatibility antigens is encoded by endogenous retroviruses; the implications of these results for understanding the origin and the identity of non-H-2 histocompatibility antigens are discussed.","['AI-16052/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-10815/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HD-19105/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States']",['0 (Histocompatibility Antigens)'],,PMC304168,,,,,

The validity of this approach is demonstrated using the monovalent hapten DNP-L-lysine. The affinity constant for this ligand obtained by the FITC quenching method is compared with those obtained with previously established methods: equilibrium dialysis and quenching of endogenous tryptophan for IgE in solution and [3H]-DNP-L-lysine binding to IgE on cells. The FITC quenching method has been used to carry out a detailed study of the binding of monovalent DNP-aminocapryol-L-tyrosine (DCT) and bivalent (DCT)2-cystine to FITC-IgE and its Fab fragments in solution.

We report on two cases in which the diagnosis of AUL was established according to restricted criteria. Blast cells of both patients showed phenotypic conversion during the course of disease. In one case, within 24 days from starting treatment, the leukemic phenotype changed from AUL to acute myelomonocytic leukemia (FAB L1, TdT+ to FAB M4, TdT-). The initial phenotype of this acute leukemia was characterized by the co-expression of both B-lymphoid and myeloid markers on the same cell. Moreover, analysis of esterase isoenzyme pattern showed the whole spectrum of isoenzymes typically seen in myelomonocytic leukemias already at diagnosis, yet blast cells additionally contained all three isoenzymes of beta-hexosaminidase typically seen in AUL. However, examination of immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy chain gene rearrangement initially and after conversion revealed an identical monoclonal configuration of Ig heavy chain sequences in both samples. The second AUL patient relapsed after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation with common ALL-antigen (CALLA) positive acute leukemia. Subsequent Southern blot analysis showed a novel rearranged Ig fragment compared to the analysis before transplantation indicating that the leukemic clones prior to and after transplantation were not identical. No chromosomal abnormalities were observed in both cases. These data support the view that AUL cells originate from a pluripotent stem cell that is capable to differentiate in the myelomonocytic lineage (patient 1), and confirm the value of Ig gene analysis as marker for cellular clonality.",,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', 'EC 3.4.24.11 (Neprilysin)']",,,,,,,

The presence of any chromosomal translocation in these CALLA- ALL was related to measures of increased leukemic cell burden including higher leukocyte counts, larger liver and spleen sizes and higher serum lactic dehydrogenase levels.

These results led to an examination of the effects of both direct and indirect inhibitors of this enzyme using intact SCC-25 cells. It was found that drugs that have an indirect effect on this enzyme--methotrexate (MTX), hydroxyurea (HU), and 3,4-dihydroxybenzylamine (3,4-DHBA)--acted as noncompetitive inhibitors and the inhibition of thymidylate synthase by these drugs did not result in the accumulation of its substrate, dUMP. This suggested that these drugs are also inhibiting steps leading to the formation of dUMP by a mechanism that is coordinated with the inhibition of thymidylate synthase. 5-Fluorodeoxyuridine (FUDR), a competitive inhibitor of thymidylate synthase, did cause an increase in the dUMP pool size indicating that this drug did not affect the synthesis of this substrate. There was a good correlation for the inhibition of growth, DNA synthesis, and thymidylate synthase with HU, 3,4-DHBA, and FUDR. However, the results suggested fundamentally different mechanistic reasons for the close relationship among these three inhibitory effects. Finally the inhibition of growth by MTX did not appear to correlate with the inhibition of DNA synthesis. The implication of these results for the therapy of epidermally derived proliferative disorders, especially with combinations such as MTX and 5-FU, is discussed.","['AM31899/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States', 'CA24988/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Deoxyuracil Nucleotides)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '039LU44I5M (Floxuridine)', '37491-68-2 (3,4-dihydroxybenzylamine)', ""964-26-1 (2'-deoxyuridylic acid)"", 'EC 2.1.1.45 (Thymidylate Synthase)', 'VTD58H1Z2X (Dopamine)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",,,,,,,

These antigens are composed of discrete alpha subunits, designated alpha L, alpha M, and alpha X, that are each noncovalently associated with a common beta subunit. Monoclonal antibodies directed against the individual subunits served as markers in both indirect immunofluorescence studies and immunoprecipitations from HL-60 cells differentiated preferentially towards mature granulocytes (DMSO, retinoic acid) or monocyte/macrophages (PMA, vitamin D3). In undifferentiated HL-60 cells, the alpha L and alpha X subunits were constitutively expressed, whereas the alpha M subunit was not. Differentiation of HL-60 cells along the granulocytic pathway with DMSO resulted in a marked increase in alpha M and minimal increases in alpha L and alpha X. The phenotypic expression of these antigens on DMSO-treated HL-60 cells closely resembled that on normal circulating PMN. Differentiation along the monocyte/macrophage pathway when using PMA or vitamin D3 resulted in major increases in alpha L and alpha X expression, as well as alpha M. These changes resulted in a surface phenotype characteristic of that present on human monocyte-derived macrophages. Triggering of undifferentiated HL-60 cells with PMA caused no increase in subunit expression, whereas stimulation of DMSO-differentiated HL-60 cells with PMA produced more than a 1.5-fold enhancement of both the alpha M and alpha X subunits, and stimulation of human PMN with PMA increased the surface expression of alpha M more than fourfold and alpha X subunit twofold. Stimulation with PMA produced no change in expression of the alpha L subunit in any of the three cell populations. These results indicate that the alpha subunits of this glycoprotein family can be selectively regulated during in vitro differentiation of a human promyelocytic leukemia cell line. Second, DMSO-differentiated HL-60 cells and human PMN possessed an intracellular pool of alpha M and alpha X, but not alpha L, that could be translocated to the surface. Thus, despite structural and functional relationships among the alpha subunits in this glycoprotein family, they undergo disparate surface expression and intracellular regulation during differentiation.","['AII9768/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'HL 18645/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-07093/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, Complement)', '0 (Receptors, Complement 3b)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,,,,,,

Decontamination either in in vitro or in vivo leads to a disappearance of 71K and re-infection causes its reappearance. The 71K receptor appears to be induced by the action of the mycoplasma on a surface molecule, most likely R, present on the cells at the time of infection.

This review summarizes recent studies concerning the hematological findings in newborn infants with Down's syndrome, the transient leukemoid/leukemia-like proliferative disorders in these infants, the increased incidence of leukemia and types of leukemia in patients with Down's syndrome, and immunological studies of these patients. In addition, studies concerning the significance of the extra genetic material in chromosome 21 found in patients with Down's syndrome are discussed. It appears that the extra genetic material in chromosome 21 confers a proliferative advantage to hematopoietic stem cells, and may make them more prone to further karyotypic changes leading to leukemia. Megakaryocytic proliferative disorders are more common in patients with Down's syndrome. The spectrum of myeloproliferative disorders including myelofibrosis, myeloid metaplasia, and megakaryoblastic leukemia is seen in these patients. Studies of the genetic loci on chromosome 21 have demonstrated loci for enzymes involved in purine biosyntheses. Further studies of specific loci on chromosome 21 may help explain the hematopoietic growth advantages found in the stem cells with an extra chromosome 21.",,,,,,,,,

The cells were treated with BCNU at concentrations of 0, 3, or 10 microM, incubated for 48 h, then treated with reovirus at a multiplicity of infection of 0, 10, 30, or 100 for 2, 6, or 12 h. The survival of mice injected with cells treated with any amount of reovirus, regardless of BCNU treatment, was greater than that of mice injected with untreated cells. Exposure of the cells to reovirus for 6 or 12 h increased the survival of mice injected with these cells as compared with that of mice injected with cells exposed to reovirus for 2 h. Of the survivors, 76% were resistant to subsequent challenge with untreated L1210 cells. These results suggest that activities associated with reovirus replication may cause modifications of L1210 cells that enable them to induce an immune response, thus facilitating their rejection. A lack of correlation between differences in DNA synthesis (measured by 3H-thymidine uptake) by treated cells and the ability of those cells to kill recipient mice indicates that rejection of cells treated with reovirus or BCNU is not due to a decrease in their ability to proliferate or, presumably, to generate lethal tumors. The survival of mice injected with treated L1210 cell preparations containing as few as 2.9% reovirus-infected cells was enhanced to the same degree as that of mice injected with those containing as many as 14.6% infected cells, indicating that modification of only a minor component of the tumor cell population is sufficient to alter the ability of the cells to generate a lethal tumor.",,['U68WG3173Y (Carmustine)'],,,,,,,

Mechanisms of resistance to be identified were: overexpression of dihydrofolate reductase, decreased cellular uptake of methotrexate, decreased affinity of dihydrofolate reductase for methotrexate, decreased polyglutamylation of methotrexate, and low thymidylate synthase activity. The initial screening procedure utilizes 3H release after addition of [5-3H]-2'-deoxyuridine as a measure of intracellular activity of thymidylate synthase and of DNA synthesis; 3H release is assayed after 3-h incubations with methotrexate, trimetrexate, or gamma-fluoromethotrexate and after 4-h incubations with these agents followed by a 6-h incubation in drug free medium. The pattern of DNA synthesis inhibition and recovery under these two sets of conditions establishes the presence or absence of methotrexate resistance and allows a tentative classification of the resistance mechanism involved. In combination with determinations of dihydrofolate reductase activity, methotrexate titration studies, and the determination of intracellular drug accumulations in vitro, the system is readily able to classify CCRF-CEM human leukemia cell lines possessing well defined mechanisms of resistance. The findings in seven leukemia patients are also reported.

We report here the drug effect on growth and cell cycle progression of L1210 mouse leukemia cells in vitro and in vivo. At doses which inhibited the growth of L1210 cells in vitro, menogaril slowed the progression of cells through S phase and blocked cells in G2 + M. 7-R-O-Methyl-N-demethylnogarol, the major metabolite of menogaril had the same effects on cell progression in vitro. Menogaril effect on cell progression in vivo was studied with peritoneal L1210 ascites growing in CD2F1 mice. Early in infection, i.e., 3 days after inoculation of 10(5) L1210 cells, DNA histograms of cells from control and drug-treated mice showed only a G1 peak. This presumably represented host diploid G0-G1 cells which predominated in the peritoneal cavity and masked the histogram of L1210 cells. Later in infection, when about 10(8) or more cells were present in the ascites, L1210 cells predominated and DNA histograms were representative of L1210 cells. When menogaril was injected at this time, the cell cycle effects were similar to those seen in vitro. Therefore, the L1210 in vivo model can be used to study cell progression effects only late in infection (when L1210 cells predominate), and due consideration should be given to contamination of the L1210 cells with host G0-G1 cells.",,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '8JSV4O30HQ (Menogaril)', 'L059DCD6IP (Nogalamycin)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",,,,,,,

The HLA-DR antigen was either acquired or lost in 5 of the 68 cases, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase was lost in 6 of 25 cases, and reactivity of the T10 antigen with monoclonal antibodies was increased in 6 of 17 cases of non-T cell ALL. Conversion to acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia, so-called lineage switch, was noted in two cases of common ALL and one of pre-B ALL, coinciding with the loss of CALLA. Results of chromosomal analyses in cases with a loss of CALLA implicated several mechanisms in the observed phenotypic changes. In six cases, including each instance of lineage switch, the original karyotype had been replaced by an entirely different abnormal karyotype, suggesting clonal selection or induction of a second malignancy. In another case, the evidence suggested clonal evolution. Our findings demonstrate that sequential phenotypic and cytogenetic studies may yield valuable insights into the mechanisms of leukemic recurrence and may have implications for treatment selection.","['CA-20180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', 'EC 3.4.24.11 (Neprilysin)']",,,,,,['Blood 1987 Mar;69(3):996'],

The antibodies were selected to identify differentiation-associated antigens of either the myeloid lineage (MY9, PM-81, AML-2-23, MY7, MCS-1, MY8, Mo1, MY1, MY4, Mo2), T cell lineage (T101, T11), B cell lineage (B1, B4) or multiple lineages [J5 (CALLA), HLA-DR]. Independent morphological review and classification by French-American-British (FAB) criteria was performed in 161 of the 196 cases. One or more myeloid surface antigens were detected on the blasts of 195 cases, while B and T cell markers were detected on 0% to 2% of cases. When both blood and marrow samples were studied on the same patient, very few differences were noted between the antigenic profiles of the paired specimens. The frequency of expression of individual myeloid antigens ranged from 91% (PM-81) to 29% (Mo2). Expression of individual antigens was found to correlate significantly with several clinical parameters including FAB classification, cytochemical staining for alpha naphthyl acetate esterase, leukocyte count, and the presence of extramedullary disease at presentation. Two myeloid antigens (MY4 and MY7) predicted for a low rate of complete remission (CR) to standard induction chemotherapy. MY4+ cases (37% of the total population) had a CR rate of 53%, while M4- cases had a CR rate of 69% (P = .03). MY7+ cases (57% of the total population) had a CR rate of 55% while MY7- cases had a CR rate of 73% (P = .01). Neither MY4 nor MY7 antigen expression was correlated with patient age. Paired combinations of antigens were also examined. The [MY4- MY7-] phenotype was exhibited by 32% of all cases and was associated with an 82% CR rate while the CR rate of all other cases was 54% (P = .001). The expression of three antigens (HLA-DR, MY8, Mo1) was associated with a decreased continuous complete remission (P less than .05, median follow-up time of 19 months). Expression of MY8 antigen was also associated with decreased survival (P = .03).

Failure of commercially obtained lipids to provide sufficient protection, however, underscored the necessity for development of additional analytical approaches. In order to identify the phospholipid distribution in the intimate natural environment of this receptor, both the plasma membrane vesicles and the ligand-receptor complex (IgE-Fc epsilon R) have been isolated by affinity chromatography. The phospholipids of both preparations were compared. After extensive washing with detergent lipid micelles, IgE-Fc epsilon R retained 0.1-1% of the total phospholipids in the purified plasma membrane. The receptor-bound lipids were shown to contain phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin; the content of the latter lipid was enriched 2-5-fold compared with that in the plasma membranes. This pattern was observed with several detergents employed for purification and under a variety of experimental conditions. In light of the general distribution of choline phospholipids in the outer leaflet of plasma membranes, this enrichment may not be a characteristic of this particular receptor exclusively. These observations should be particularly helpful in studies on aggregation-induced functions of the isolated Fc epsilon receptor.

The neoplastic nodules in MZL consisted of medium-sized lymphoid cells with slightly irregular nuclei and finely dispersed chromatin, expressing monoclonal surface IgM or IgM plus IgD, and displaying membranous alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity. These cells proliferated around follicular centers that demonstrated a polyclonal pattern of reactivity for both types of light chains and a distorted meshwork of dendritic reticulum cells. The neoplastic nodules in NPDLL consisted of small lymphoid cells with markedly irregular nuclei and coarsely granulated chromatin, expressing monoclonal surface IgM and lacking ALP-activity. These tumor cells also frequently expressed transferrin receptor and common acute lymphoblastic leukemia-antigen (CALLA). The neoplastic nodules showed an undistorted meshwork of dendritic reticulum cells, and were occasionally bordered by remnants of polyclonal lymphocytic coronas. These results confirm the previous suggestion that NPDLL arises from a cell type that is a normal constituent of follicular centers, whereas MZL arises from the lymphocytic corona. The morphological, enzyme- and immunohistochemical features of MZL cells strongly suggest that MZL arises from marginal zone lymphocytes, a subset of corona lymphocytes that expresses ALP-activity, high IgM and low IgD-levels.",,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Immunoglobulins)', 'EC 3.1.3.1 (Alkaline Phosphatase)', 'EC 3.4.24.11 (Neprilysin)']",,,,,,,

Cells from BCL1-3B3 were induced to secrete IgM in the presence of recombinant interleukin 2 (rIL 2) (10 to 50 U/ml); a concomitant increase in proliferation was observed. Recombinant interferon-gamma (rIFN-gamma) was a potent inhibitor of proliferation. In addition, rIFN-gamma did not induce an increase in IgM secretion and, when added to rIL 2-stimulated BCL1-3B3 cells, completely blocked IgM secretion at a concentration of 10 U/ml. Purified and recombinant IL 1 (rIL 1) had no significant effect on differentiation either alone or in combination with rIL 2 and/or rIFN-gamma. However, rIL 1 was able to synergize with rIL 2 in enhancing the proliferation of BCL1-3B3. The ability of cells to respond to rIL 2 was limited to the in vitro (Ly-1+) clones of BCL1 cells since the in vivo derived (Ly-1-) BCL1 cells did not differentiate in response to IL 2. Consistent with their functional response to rIL 2, cells from the in vitro clone (3B3) are IL 2-receptor-positive (IL-2R+) and the in vivo derived BCL1 cells are IL-2R-. A second set of neoplastic B cell clones derived from the AKR 225 lymphoma did not respond to rIL 2 even though they expressed receptors for IL 2 and could be induced by T cell supernatant to secrete IgM, thus indicating that expression of IL 2R is not the sole requirement for IL 2 responsiveness. The monoclonal anti-IL 2R antibody (7D4) mimicked IL 2 in its ability to stimulate differentiation of BCL1-3B3 cells. These data suggest that rIL 2 and the monoclonal anti-IL-2R antibody are capable of inducing a differentiative response in the Ly-1+ BCL1-3B3 cells that is functionally equivalent to the response evoked by the previously described lymphokine B cell differentiation factor for IgM (BCDF mu). Thus, two distinct lymphokines appear to be providing a similar signal to a clonal neoplastic B cell population. Furthermore, rIL 2 is capable of providing both a proliferative and a differentiative signal.","['AI-11851/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-37670/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Antigens, Ly)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",,,,,,,

These LGLs were E rosette+ and Fc(IgG) receptor+ and therefore are referred to as T gamma lymphocytes. They were also Leu-11+ and OKT11+; however, they were clearly negative for Leu-7, OKT3, OKT8, OKM1, and HNK-1 antigens as well as for terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase activity. Karyotype analysis revealed 47, XXX. The LGLs showed no rearrangement of T cell receptor C beta genes. The natural killer (NK) cell activity against K562 target cells was low, but was significantly augmented after stimulation by recombinant human interleukin 2 (IL 2) in contrast to minimal NK boosting by recombinant human gamma-interferon (gamma-IFN). Such a unique responsive ability to lymphokines was quite similar to that noted in fetal and cord blood cells. These LGLs also demonstrated a considerable increase in antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) activity after a short incubation with IL 2. Although in a resting stage they showed no IL 2 receptor expression as examined by anti-Tac antibody, Tac antigen appeared after IL 2 treatment followed by a marked increase in 3H-thymidine incorporation and a remarkable production of gamma-IFN. To investigate the mechanism of neutropenia, in vitro IL 2-stimulated coculture studies of these cells with normal bone marrow cells were performed.

We therefore investigated the natural resistance of such infants to hematological malignancy in vitro by means of natural killer cell assays. Mean natural killer cell determinations in four infants with LLR-DS were 17.5 +/- 9.2% and 37.6 +/- 18.5% against K-562 and Molt-4 target cells, respectively, at diagnosis. Later, during remission, these values were 34.3 +/- 14.3% against K-562 and 32.2 +/- 15.6% against Molt-4. The mean percentage lysis of Molt-4 both at diagnosis and during remission was greater (p less than 0.05) in LLR-DS than in children with acute lymphocytic leukemia and acute myelogenous leukemia at diagnosis. Natural killer cell activity levels in these LLR-DS patients were similar to levels obtained in other infants with Down's syndrome who were hematologically normal, as well as levels obtained in normal control specimens. Two of these LLR-DS patients progressively developed acute myelogenous leukemia with ultrastructural abnormalities several months later; one of these also developed another karyotype abnormality.

Since this MoAb also reacts with polymorphonuclear (PMN) leukocytes, it was of interest to determine whether or not MoAbs to CALLA affected PMN function. We therefore evaluated four MoAbs to CALLA for their effect on PMN function. Two of the MoAbs were IgG and two were IgM. Chemotaxis was studied using Micro-Boyden chambers. Intraleukocyte bacterial killing was studied using Staph:PMN of 2:1 and 10:1, and metabolic activation was evaluated by hexose monophosphate shunt activity.

However, the majority 15/23 did not bind or bound weakly (less than 25% rosettes) unless in the form of antigen-antibody complexes. As complexes, all IgG subclasses except IgG3 could produce rosettes with RBL cells. None of the IgM or IgA MC tested formed rosettes, even in complexed form.

Modifications of the basic anthracycline structure have resulted in molecules that may share the activity of the parent compound, with amelioration of some toxicities, absence of cross-resistance, or activity against tumors insensitive to the parent drug. Epirubicin has a unique metabolic pathway, glucuronidation, that may result in more rapid plasma clearance and reduced toxicity as compared with doxorubicin. Epirubicin has demonstrated comparable activity to doxorubicin in breast cancer, with possibly reduced toxicity. Idarubicin is of interest because of its cytotoxic activity when given orally. Idarubicin has prolonged retention in the plasma and has equal cytotoxic activity to the parent compound. Idarubicin has demonstrated activity against acute leukemia and breast cancer; in the latter tumor category, some doxorubicin-resistant tumors have responded. Esorubicin is of interest because of its nearly absent cardiac toxicity. This agent has some activity against solid tumors and is currently being clinically tested. Aclacinomycin A is an anthracycline in which a trisaccharide is substituted for the aminosugar. Aclacinomycin A and the related compound marcellomycin are of interest as both cytotoxic and differentiating agents. Menogaril is an anthracycline with the aminosugar on the D ring; it does not exhibit cross-resistance with doxorubicin or cardiotoxicity. Mitoxantrone is a compound that is related to the anthracyclines but has a different mechanism of action. This agent has significant activity against acute leukemia and breast cancer and is currently being compared with doxorubicin. Amsacrine is another compound related to the anthracyclines that possesses major activity against acute leukemias. Minor modifications of the anthracycline molecule have had major impact on the biologic activity of these drugs. New anthracycline analogues with up to 100 times the potency of currently available anthracyclines are being developed for clinical testing, and these complex molecules retain a nearly unlimited potential for structural modification.",['P30CA 13330-15/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Naphthacenes)', '00DPD30SOY (Amsacrine)', '3Z8479ZZ5X (Epirubicin)', '74KXF8I502 (Aclarubicin)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8JSV4O30HQ (Menogaril)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'L059DCD6IP (Nogalamycin)', 'RMC41L2WQ3 (esorubicin)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",,,,,,,

Given this arrangement the T3 gamma polypeptide most probably has a transmembrane orientation with the N-terminal domain exposed on the cell surface.

Six receptor-negative tumors were found among leukemic cells of lymphoid origin. Scatchard analysis with 125I-labeled human recombinant IFN-gamma revealed a similar binding affinity with a mean dissociation constant (Kd) of around 2 X 10(-11) M not only for various established cell lines, but also for leukemic and carcinoma cells derived from biopsy material. In contrast to similar KdS, large differences in the number of expressed IFN-gamma membrane receptors were found on distinct tumor cells of the same cell type ranging from a few hundred up to 2 X 10(4) for both carcinoma cells and leukemic cells.

This reduced folate enhanced the cytotoxicity and the growth inhibitory potency of 5-fluorouracil (5-FUra) and of 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine (FUdR) against all cell lines examined. The human leukemic cell lines used (two T- and two B-cells) were affected by these fluoropyrimidines only at substantially higher concentrations than were found to be inhibitory to mouse L1210 cells; however, the enhancement of the activity of the fluoropyrimidines occurred over the same range of folinic acid concentrations in mouse and human cells. Whereas the total intracellular folate pool increased continuously with every increment of folinic acid added to the medium, the enhancement of the potency of the fluoropyrimidines was limited. Augmentation of the effects of FUdR exceeded that of 5-fluorouracil in the human leukemic cells studied. The cytotoxicity of the fluoropyrimidines (as defined by cloning efficiency) was enhanced to a greater extent than was growth inhibition so that an impressive lethal synergism was noted; for instance, exposure of L1210 cells to nontoxic concentrations of 5-fluorouracil or FUdR in the presence of folinic acid resulted in a 98 or 99.9% cell kill, respectively. In contrast to previous predictions, the fluoropyrimidines were more inhibitory to mouse leukemic cells containing folate pools that were suboptimal for growth than for folate-replete cells. Growth rate experiments showed that cells exposed to moderate concentrations of FUdR were initially inhibited but recovered with time, whereas in cells exposed to both FUdR and folinic acid, the initial growth inhibitory effects were sustained. We conclude that folinic acid stabilizes the effects of the fluoropyrimidines on thymidylate synthase of both mouse and human leukemic cell populations and that this enhancement is reflected in both inhibition of the growth of and the lethality to these cells.

A number of different hematopoietic cell lines belonging to erythroid, myeloid, T-lymphoid, and B-lymphoid cell lineages were found to possess glycoproteins that were immunoprecipitated by these antibodies. However, the apparent molecular weights differed between cell lines, ranging from 113,000 to 150,000. In almost all cases, the immune precipitated molecule corresponded to the major sialoglycoprotein of the respective cell. Pulse-chase experiments showed that all cells produced an early precursor form of the molecule of 54 kDa, which was susceptible to endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H to give an apoprotein of 52 kDa. Neuraminidase treatment of the mature forms resulted in a characteristic decrease of the mobility in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (apparent molecular weights from 150,000 to 183,000). Amino acid analysis of the glycoprotein isolated from HL-60 cells showed a high content of serine, threonine, and proline, and the carbohydrate composition was compatible with the presence of a large number (approximately 90) of O-linked carbohydrate chains. The name leukosialin is proposed for this sialoglycoprotein, which seems to be widely distributed, but differently glycosylated, on leukocytes with diverse functions. In the following paper (Carlsson, S.R., Sasaki, H., and Fukuda, M. (1986) J. Biol.

The four monoclonal antibodies (mAb) fall into two groups. The first group was comprised of 3 antibodies (mAb BC4, mAb CD3, and mAb CA5) that reacted with the Fc epsilon R at epitopes close or identical to the IgE-binding site. With 125I-labeled antibodies there was reciprocal cross-inhibition between the antibodies and IgE. The antibodies activated both RBL-2H3 cells and normal rat mast cells for histamine release. The 3 antibodies immunoprecipitated the previously described alpha, beta, and gamma components of the receptor. The number of radiolabeled Fab fragments of 2 of these antibodies bound per cell was similar or equal to the number of IgE receptors. In contrast, the mAb BC4 Fab bound to 2.1 +/- 0.4 times the number of IgE receptor sites. Therefore, the portion of the Fc epsilon R exposed on the cell surface must have two identical epitopes and an axis of symmetry. These 3 monoclonal antibodies recognize different but closely related epitopes in the IgE-binding region of the Fc epsilon R. The fourth monoclonal antibody (mAb AA4) had different characteristics. In cross-inhibition studies, IgE and the other 3 monoclonals did not inhibit the binding of this 125I-labeled monoclonal antibody. The number of molecules of this antibody bound per cell was approximately 14-fold greater than the Fc epsilon R number.

The cases of aleukemic leukemia cutis reported in the literature show little or no conformity in their clinical appearance. Enzyme cytochemistry, immunocytological and electron-microscopic studies are of considerable help in differentiating the cutaneous infiltrates and in establishing early diagnosis. We report herein a patient with erythroderma which regressed spontaneously, whereas microscopic examination of a cutaneous biopsy showed atypical cells infiltrating the dermis.

The typical 9;22 translocation results in the transposition of the cellular oncogene Abelson in close proximity of chromosome 22 linked critical sequences.

Only randomized studies will result in such a proof, on the condition that all the specific technical parameters of each method have been perfectly defined. The clinical results of pilot evaluation studies for the prevention of graft-versus-host reaction through the elimination of T lymphocytes in the donor graft have been encouraging. They have shown the feasibility and efficacy of different methods of T cell depletion. One point however remains controversial: is it necessary or not to eliminate all T lymphocytes? After a depletion which is too efficient, the difficulties involved in grafting the donor's hematopoietic cells on the recipient represent a new problem, e.g., in allogenic grafts for acute leukemia (host-versus-graft). In order to resolve the problem of these take failures (10 to 20% of the published series except for Royal Free Hospital and Besancon) it appears necessary to redefine the conditioning regimen prior to allogenic bone marrow transplantation.",,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Lectins)', '0 (Plant Lectins)', '0 (Soybean Proteins)', '0 (soybean lectin)', '88746-71-8 (Asta Z 7557)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', '9009-86-3 (Ricin)', 'EC 3.4.24.11 (Neprilysin)', 'U880A4FUDA (perfosfamide)', 'X4W7ZR7023 (Methylprednisolone)']",,,,Les methodes de tri cellulaire au cours des greffes de moelle osseuse autologue (elimination des cellules malignes residuelles) ou allogeniques (elimination des lymphocytes T).

Inoculation of a low leukemogenic RadLV variant (D-RadLV) does not result in lymphoma development unless the animals receive a single, sublethal dose of irradiation. Whereas virus-induced primary lymphomas produce virus, express gp70 and are all immunogenic, those induced by X-rays are devoid of virus expression and are not immunogenic. A-RadLV inoculation into B6 mice is associated with early induction of virus specific, cyclophosphamide sensitive suppressor T cells which are capable of abrogating a potential antitumor immune responsiveness. D-RadLV, on the other hand, induces reactive T lymphocytes that arrest leukemogenesis unless their function is impaired by irradiation. In (B6 X BALB/c)F1 mice both A-RadLV and D-RadLV leukemogenesis depend on sublethal irradiation of the host, and both induce reactive T cells. These results suggest that (a) RadLV and X-ray induced leukemogeneses involve different etiologies.

This study shows that lack of clinical response to interferon therapy may coincide with failure to induce 2,5A synthetase activity.

There was no response in the mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) and no suppression of the MLR between two healthy donors. Antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity and NK activity could not be demonstrated. Cytogenetic analysis revealed complex clonal aberrations, including an interstitial deletion of the long arm of chromosome 14 concerning bands q21-31, loss of chromosome 20, and loss of the Y chromosome. Cytostatic chemotherapy was of little use and caused serious side effects, whereas leukapheresis proved effective in reducing the tumor load.

The remainder of the CALLA-positive cells displayed low intensity of CALLA expression, positivity for the common leukocyte antigen, B1 and peanut agglutinin, and negative reaction with TdT and MY10. Both CALLA-positive subpopulations were positive for HLA-DR and the pan-B cell marker B4, but negative for cytoplasmic immunoglobulin, B2 and Leu 1. BrdU labelling studies showed that a similar proportion of cells in each subpopulation was in S phase. A slightly higher proportion of the strongly CALLA-positive cells possessed the morphologic features of high nuclear/cytoplasmic (N/C) ratio and prominent nucleoli. These studies suggest that a discrete maturation step occurs among CALLA-positive marrow lymphoid cells, resulting in the loss of TdT and MY10 expression, but gradual acquisition of the B cell marker B1 and the common leukocyte antigen. The presence of B4 antigen in nearly all CALLA-positive cells suggests that both subpopulations of normal CALLA-positive marrow cells are committed to the B cell lineage.","['CA 39569/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA11198/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'NS 22039/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']","['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', 'EC 3.4.24.11 (Neprilysin)']",,,,,,,

In all 16 patients with acute leukaemia in remission treated with high-dose chemotherapy and single or double ABMT, T-helper numbers and function in an assay measuring PWM-induced Ig synthesis were grossly defective and closely resembled the defects observed after allo-BMT involving chemoradiotherapy (six patients). T-helper activity was more variable after chemotherapy only (eight patients), but in individual patients the defect was as great as that observed after BMT. In contrast, suppressor activity was comparably increased in all patient groups and increased numbers of Leu 15+ Dr+ Tac- suppressor T cells were consistently observed, suggesting chronic activation of suppressor T cells, the cause of which remains unknown. B-cell function was also uniformly impaired in all patients tested. It is therefore concluded that defective immune function after BMT is not due to alloimmune or radiotherapy-mediated effects. Furthermore, since many patients were studied a prolonged period after BMT and had no T cells with a thymic phenotype and no evidence of infection, it is unlikely that the defects are secondary to cellular immaturity following marrow regeneration or to superadded infection. The gross immune defects observed after various forms of BMT are likely, therefore, to be directly attributable to the chemotherapy involved.",,['8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)'],,,,,,,

We have undertaken a series of experiments to examine 1) the structural homology between leukemia cell and neutrophil CALLA/CD10 and 2) the putative function CALLA/CD10 subserves to human neutrophils. Biosynthetic labeling, peptide mapping, and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis indicate that neutrophils synthesize and express a CALLA/CD10 molecule that is similar, but not identical, to leukemic cell CALLA/CD10. The level of CALLA/CD10 expression is similar on the two cell populations, and neutrophil CALLA/CD10 (like its leukemic cell counterpart) undergoes antigenic modulation. Finally, we report that neutrophil cell surface-bound anti-CALLA/CD10 monoclonal antibodies inhibit the chemotactic response to both N-Formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (F-mlp) and zymosan-activated sera (ZAS), but had no inhibitory effect on random migration, degranulation, or aggregation.

Tryptic peptide analysis showed that the in vitro and in vivo 32P-labeled IL-2 receptors were phosphorylated on the same sites. A synthetic peptide corresponding to the carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic tail of the IL-2 receptor was shown to be phosphorylated in vitro by protein kinase C. Tryptic digestion of the peptide generated the same 32P-labeled species as those found for the IL-2 receptor. From these studies, it was concluded that Ser-247 is the major site of phosphorylation in the IL-2 receptor and that Thr-250 is a minor site.

Results of these studies have been combined with markers such as surface membrane and cytoplasmic immunoglobulin on B lymphocytes, sheep erythrocyte receptors on T lymphocytes, and cytochemical stains. Using all of the above markers, it is now clear that acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is heterogeneous. Furthermore, monoclonal antibodies that identify B cells, such as the anti-B1 and anti-B4 antibodies in combination with studies of immunoglobulin gene rearrangement, have demonstrated that virtually all cases of non-T-ALL are malignancies of B cell origin. At least six distinct subgroups of non-T-ALL can now be identified. T-ALL is subdivided by the anti-Leu-9, anti-Leu-1, and antibodies that separate T lymphocyte subsets into three primary subgroups. Monoclonal antibodies are also useful in the subclassification of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and certain distinct markers can be correlated with morphologic classification. The cellular origin of the malignant Reed-Sternberg cell in Hodgkin's disease remains uncertain. A substantial number of investigators favor a myelocyte/macrophage origin based on cytochemical staining; however, consistent reactivity with antimonocyte reagents has not been demonstrated. Although monoclonal antibodies are useful in distinguishing acute myeloid from acute lymphoid leukemias, they have less certain utility in the subclassification of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). Attempts to subclassify AML by differentiation-associated antigens rather than by the French-American-British (FAB) classification are underway in order to document the potential prognostic utility of surface markers. Therapeutic trials using monoclonal antibodies in leukemia and lymphoma have been reported. Intravenous (IV) infusion of unlabeled antibodies is the most widely used method; transient responses have been demonstrated. Antibodies conjugated to radionuclides have been quite successful in localizing tumors of less than 1 cm in some studies. Therapy trials with antibodies conjugated to isotopes, toxins, and drugs are currently planned. Purging of autologous bone marrow with monoclonal antibodies and complement in vitro has been used in ALL and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma; preliminary data suggest that this approach may be an effective therapy and may circumvent many of the obstacles and toxicities associated with in vivo monoclonal antibody infusion.",['CA 39064/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)', 'EC 3.4.24.11 (Neprilysin)']",,,,,,,

The results were analysed to evaluate the reproducibility of ALL phenotype determinations. Specimens were transported between laboratories by 24-h courier service and were classified on the basis of indirect immunofluorescence MoAb reactivities as follows: B-lineage ALL (BA-1+T-MCS-2-); T-lineage ALL (T+BA-1-MCS-2-); myeloid antigen ALL (MCS-2+BA-1-CALLA-T-) and unclassified ALL (BA-1-MCS-2-CALLA-T-). Conventional marker studies for surface immunoglobulin (sIg), cytoplasmic immunoglobulin (cIg), sheep erythrocyte rosette formation (E) and nuclear terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) were also performed. In the cases with sufficient marker data to permit classification, 90% (18/20) were identically classified by different laboratories and this concordance was statistically significant (p less than 0.05). The agreement between laboratories for individual MoAb and conventional marker analyses was statistically significant (p less than 0.05) for all markers with the exception of BA-2, cIg and TdT determinations. Six of 7 discordant BA-2 cases represented BA-2+ evaluations which had subsequent BA-2- results following specimen transportation. These findings suggest instability of the BA-2 antigen to transport conditions. A similar pattern of positive to negative evaluations following transportation was observed in 5/5 discordant results involving other MoAbs. Disagreement between laboratories for cIg and TdT determinations implies that the detection of cytoplasmic or nuclear antigens may be more prone to subjective interpretation than cell surface antigen marker analyses. Our findings suggest that immunofluorescence marker studies employing MoAbs to cell surface antigens are in general highly reproducible. Our results also indicate that specimen storage conditions and the cellular location of target antigens are important variables which may affect the reproducibility of ALL phenotype determinations.","['CA 03927/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 12011/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 31809/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']","['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Immunoglobulins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', 'EC 2.7.7.31 (DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase)', 'EC 3.4.24.11 (Neprilysin)']",,,,,,,

It consists of engrafting a patient, after ablative chemotherapy and/or total-body irradiation (TBI), with marrow taken from the patient at a propitious time in the history of the disease and usually cryopreserved. This technique has two major consequences: ABMT by reducing the length and variability of posttreatment aplasia can be considered a super hematologic support. It allows the use of chemotherapeutic agents and/or TBI at doses that surpass the dose for effecting the threshold of myelotoxicity. Therefore, a greater tumor cell kill can be expected at a reasonably low cost in terms of toxicity. In patients with acute leukemia (AL), however, the contribution of ABMT may go far beyond. In the initial trials (1974-79), the marrow of patients with AL was collected during complete remission and cryopreserved, with the idea of preserving ""the remission status."" At relapse this marrow was re-infused after high-dose chemotherapy and/or TBI, for achieving another complete remission. The result could be considered a chronologic chimera; the autograft, which had stem cells younger than those of the organism, reproduced, over the course of a few months or years, the evolution of the remission during which it was collected. As predicted, however, all patients who received this treatment eventually relapsed. For a more aggressive technique, some teams gave autografts to patients earlier, during remission, to allow ablative therapy in the consolidation mode; the whole procedure, including the pretransplant cytoreductive regimen, was modeled on that of allografting. Because allogeneic bone marrow transplantation currently offers the best chance of long-term survival but remains severely restricted, by age and availability of an HLA-identical donor, to less than 10% of the patients, ABMT may be considered an alternative source of stem cells to the other patients. In addition, ABMT avoids the risks of graft-versus-host disease with its associated immunosuppression. However, one major impediment to effective ABMT may be the persistence of leukemia cells in the marrow autograft, although the marrow was collected during earlier remission. The recent development of numerous techniques to cleanse the marrow prior to ABMT has considerably increased the possibility of ABMT becoming a major tool in the cure of leukemia. This report reviews the early data and essentially focuses on recent results of ABMT effected in or done in remission with use of cleansed and uncleansed marrow.",,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', '9009-86-3 (Ricin)', 'EC 3.4.24.11 (Neprilysin)', 'U880A4FUDA (perfosfamide)']",,,,,,,

The factor that we have termed Immunoglobulin-Binding T cell Suppressor Factor (IgB-TsF) was shown to be suppressive for the in vitro and in vivo humoral response to a variety (but not all) antigens tested. The cell surface phenotype of the LH-8.1 subclone was M.Ig(-), Thy-1(+), L3T4(-), Lyt-2(+), FcR(-), MAC-1(-), and H-2b(+). In addition, both the cell surface and secreted factor, IgB-TsF, of LH-8.1 expressed determinants that were recognized by anti-I-Jb mAbs but not by an anti-I-Jd monoclonal. The same factor also retained an affinity for the Fc portion of approximately 30% of randomly selected, purified mAbs. This binding could be abolished if the Fab or F(ab')2 fragments of these mAb were used, but was found to be unrelated to isotype of the respective mAbs. Using subclones that expressed quantitative differences in their ability to exert suppression as sources of biosynthetically labeled IgB-TsF, we have shown the suppressor activity correlated with a single, 28 kD protein. Furthermore, comparisons of these same subclones that differ in their suppressor activity, do not show any direct correlation of this biological activity with the expression of the previously described T cell receptor genes. It also suggests that at least some suppressor cell subsets may use the same or related family of T cell receptor genes for their recognitive stage of activation as helper and cytotoxic T cell subsets, but not for their effector stage of immunologic suppression.","['5-F32-CA06873/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'AI133357/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA428900/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Fab Fragments)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Fc Fragments)', '0 (Immunoglobulin J-Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Suppressor Factors, Immunologic)']",,PMC2188128,,,,,

The recovery of in vitro-specific antibody production directed at sheep red blood cells was found to proceed through three phases. B cell function and helper T cell function were undetectable in the first phase (encompassing the first 5 months after transplantation), in which only suppressor cells reached functional maturity. Suppressor cells controlled responsiveness in the second phase (encompassing the period 5 to 15 months postgrafting). During this period, B cells and helper T cells became fully responsive; their activity became measurable, however, only after removal of Sephadex G-10-adherent suppressor cells. Normal responsiveness (associated with the loss of excessive suppressor cell activity) was characteristic of the third phase (over 15 months posttransplantation). Particular attention was paid to the role of suppressor cells in the recovery of humoral immune function. Their activity was positively correlated with graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), particularly of the chronic type. Suppressor cell activity in the early posttransplant period was predominantly mediated by OKT8-positive T lymphocytes, whereas suppressor cell activity in chronic GVHD patients was predominantly mediated by peripheral blood mononuclear cells that were retained on Sephadex G-10 columns, but did not express OKT8 antigen.","['CA 08748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 19267/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,

The dependence of retinoic acid (RA)-induced terminal myeloid differentiation of HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cells on calmodulin levels and calcium ion flux was ascertained. RA-treated and untreated control cells were stained for cellular DNA with a Hoechst dye. Populations of G1/0, S and G2 + M phase cells were isolated by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS). Cytosolic calmodulin levels were then measured as a function of cell cycle phase for RA-treated and untreated cells using a radioimmunoassay. RA-treated cells were measured at early times, corresponding to the pre-commitment state, and late times, when significant cell differentiation had occurred. Cellular calmodulin levels increased with progression through the cell cycle. In contrast, no difference in calmodulin levels was observed between RA-untreated or -treated cells in the same cell cycle phases at early or late times. RA-induced HL-60 terminal myeloid differentiation was thus apparently not regulated by cellular cytosolic calmodulin levels. These conclusions were supported by the effects of calmodulin antagonists and calcium flux inhibitors. The calmodulin antagonists trifluoperazine and compound 48/80 both retarded cell growth in a concentration-dependent manner. But at concentrations where cellular effect was evidenced by slight growth inhibition, neither antagonist inhibited RA-induced cell differentiation or G1/0 growth arrest. The same was true of the gated calcium channel inhibitors, verapamil and nitrendipene, and the passive calcium flux inhibitor, CoCl2. RA-induced HL-60 cell differentiation and arrest in G0 was thus apparently not strongly dependent on cellular calmodulin levels or calcium flux. This is in strong contrast to murine erythroleukemia cells.

The compound augmented the response of lymphocytes from tumor-primed animals to syngeneic tumor cells, resulting in a marked increase in tumor cell destruction. Likewise, it enhanced macrophage inhibitory effects on the growth of tumor cells in vitro. These ""activated"" macrophages were detectable in peritoneal exudates of treated mice 4 to 12 days after receiving a single oral dose of CL 259,763, with peak activity being demonstrable by day 7. The compound also restored the alloreactivity of lymphocytes from immunodepressed mice bearing the Lieberman plasma cell tumor, possibly by interfering with suppressor cells. Macrophages and lymphocytes from treated mice released significantly more IL-1 and IL-2-like factors in culture than did the control counterparts. Sera from treated mice also possessed more colony stimulating factor than those from normal mice. Immunoadjuvant effects were evident when the compound was administered with an inactivated L1210 leukemia vaccine and it enhanced the effectiveness of cytotoxic chemotherapy when given to mice challenged with P388 murine leukemia.

By comparison with blasts having the common ALL phenotype, the pre-B cells were more likely to have a DNA index less than 1.16 (P = 0.02), a pseudodiploid karyotype (P less than 0.001), and a chromosomal translocation (P = 0.001). Increased serum lactic dehydrogenase levels (P = 0.001) were also characteristic of pre-B ALL; otherwise, the clinical and laboratory features of the two groups were similar. A nonrandom chromosomal translocation, t(1;19)(q23;p13.3), was identified in blast cells from 16 (23%) of the 70 patients with pre-B ALL and adequate chromosome banding studies; different translocations were found in 11 of the remaining patients. The presence of any chromosomal translocation in the pre-B group was significantly related to a higher leukocyte count, an increased level of serum lactic dehydrogenase, an increased percentage of S-phase cells, black race, and a blast cell DNA index less than 1.16. Four presenting features were found to confer an increased risk of treatment failure among pre-B patients: pseudodiploidy, chromosomal translocation, black race, and higher serum lactic dehydrogenase level. In a multivariate analysis, pseudodiploidy emerged as the strongest factor for predicting relapse in pre-B ALL. The frequent association of chromosomal abnormalities of known adverse prognostic significance and high serum lactic dehydrogenase levels with pre-B-cell ALL explains, at least in part, the poor treatment outcome reported for children with this subtype of leukemia.","['CA-20180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 1.1.1.27 (L-Lactate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 3.4.24.11 (Neprilysin)']",,,,,,,

We made use of conventional alloantisera and six well-characterized monoclonal antibodies (MoAb) to study the HLA class II antigens on CALLA-positive malignant B cell populations and autologous normal B cell lines. Forty additional HLA class II-specific MoAb were also tested for their ability to bind to these cells. By using indirect immunofluorescence and immune precipitation assays, we find that malignant B cells often fail to express one or more of the three known types of HLA class II antigens. Cell lines with the following five phenotypes have been identified: HLA-DR+, -DQ+, -DP+; HLA-DR+, -DQ-, -DP+; HLA-DR-, -DQ+, -DP+; HLA-DR-, -DQ-, -DP+; and HLA-DR-, -DQ-, -DP-. These cell lines have been used to characterize the subregion specificity of MoAb that react with HLA class II antigens. This work confirms the existence of complicated patterns of serologic cross-reactivity between the three different types of HLA class II molecules. It also increases our understanding of the specificity of individual MoAb, thereby facilitating future investigation of the distribution and function of individual antigens. Our studies are consistent with the proposal that altered expression of HLA antigens on tumors might impair recognition of these cells by the immune system of the host, thereby contributing to the proliferation of a malignant clone.","['CA 15704/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 18221/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 30924/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']","['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (HLA-DP Antigens)', '0 (HLA-DQ Antigens)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)', 'EC 3.4.24.11 (Neprilysin)']",,,,,,,

We investigated the role of glycosylation in these structural variations and in receptor metabolism. In the human HL-60 promyelocytic leukemic cell line differentiated toward granulocytes or monocytes and in Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B lymphoblastoid cell lines of the common phenotype, CR1 is synthesized as a precursor of Mr = 222,000 that is converted into mature CR1s with differing Mr values. Endoglycosidase F treatment of mature CR1 from all these cell types produced the same lower Mr band. Additionally, the previously noted 5,000 higher Mr of CR1 from human peripheral granulocytes versus erythrocytes was abrogated by endoglycosidase F. Hence these cell-specific variations are due to differences in N-glycosylation. Lectin affinity chromatography shows that these N-linked oligosaccharides are mostly tri- and tetraantennary complex-type species with specific differences in fractionation patterns that correlate with their differing Mrs. In lymphoblastoid cell lines, the four allelic variants each have a precursor 6,000 lower in Mr than the respective mature CR1. In the presence of tunicamycin, each of the CR1 allelic products is 25,000 lower in Mr than the glycosylated receptor. The failure to radiolabel CR1 with [3H]glucosamine in the presence of tunicamycin indicates the lack of O-linked oligosaccharide on CR1. These data, taken together, strongly suggest that the CR1 polymorphism resides at the polypeptide level. Nonglycosylated CR1 synthesized in the presence of tunicamycin had twice the turnover rate of glycosylated CR1. The efficiency of surface membrane insertion and of ligand binding to hemolytically inactive C3 were markedly reduced for nonglycosylated CR1, suggesting that glycosylation is important for the proper expression of CR1 function.",['AM07279/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Glycosides)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Oligosaccharides)', '0 (Receptors, Complement)', '0 (Receptors, Complement 3b)']",,,,,,,

It is the opinion of the authors that studies in second and subsequent remission can resolve burning issues such as the efficacy of various high-dose conditioning regimens and of different methods of elimination of leukaemic cells such as procedures based on immunological methods, monoclonal antibodies and on differences in sensitivity of stem cells and leukaemic cells to in vitro chemotherapy.

In particular, HpD intrinsic cytotoxicity was evaluated at different doses and the results correlated with those referring to membrane functional and morphological changes. HpD uptake and release processes were also studied and compared with the above-mentioned results. In order to have an overall picture of HpD-cell interactions, time-resolved fluorescence measurements were performed on both undifferentiated and differentiated MEL cells. The results obtained indicate that, even at HpD doses exhibiting neither any cytotoxicity nor any morphological damage (1-10 micrograms/ml), membrane permeability alterations are observed. Thirty minutes of treatment are sufficient for HpD to develop its toxic effect: indeed, no differences in HpD influence on cell viability can be observed after 30 min, 60 min or 5 days of treatment. HpD cytotoxicity is reduced by high protein content in the incubation culture medium. The presence of both monomeric species and 580 nm emitting species was observed at cellular level. The latter is likelier in undifferentiated MEL cells, which also exhibit higher overall HpD uptake, as compared with differentiated MEL cells.",,"['0 (Hematoporphyrins)', '68335-15-9 (Hematoporphyrin Derivative)']",,,,,,,

TS was overproduced 45-fold and was accompanied by a small increase in the activity of dihydrofolate reductase (2.6-fold). Both the level of resistance and enzyme activities were maintained in drug-free medium (greater than 300 generations). Failure of N10-propargyl-5,8-dideazafolic acid to suppress the [3H]-2'-deoxyuridine incorporation into the acid-precipitable material of the resistant line supported the evidence that TS overproduction was the mechanism of resistance; consequently the L1210:C15 cells were largely cross-resistant to another (but weaker) TS inhibitor, 5,8-dideazafolic acid. Minimal cross-resistance was observed to the dihydrofolate reductase inhibitors methotrexate and 5-methyl-5,8-dideazaaminopterin (5- and 2-fold, respectively). L1210 and L1210:C15 cells were, however, equally sensitive to 5-fluorodeoxyuridine (FdUrd), an unexpected finding since a metabolite, 5-fluorodeoxyuridine monophosphate, is a potent TS inhibitor; however, this cytotoxicity against the L1210:C15 cells was antagonized by coincubation with 5 microM folinic acid although folinic acid potentiated the cytotoxicity of FdUrd to the N10-propargyl-5,8-dideazafolic acid-sensitive L1210 line. Thymidine was much less effective as a FdUrd protecting agent in the L1210:C15 when compared with the L1210 cells; however, a combination of thymidine plus hypoxanthine was without any additional effect (compared with thymidine alone) against the sensitive line but effectively protected L1210:C15 cells such that the concentration of FdUrd necessary to reduce the cell count to 50% of control at 48 h was increased greater than 11,000-fold. We propose that the elevated TS levels result in sequestration of the reduced-folate pool (as N5,10-methylene tetrahydrofolic acid) into the TS ternary complex with 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine 5'-monophosphate. Despite ""free"" TS, the de novo synthesis of thymidylate and purines is inhibited by substrate depletion. The fact that folinic acid is able to reverse the inhibition of [3H]-2'-deoxyuridine incorporation by FdUrd into the resistant cells supports this hypothesis.",,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Folic Acid Antagonists)', '0 (Hypoxanthines)', '0 (Quinazolines)', '039LU44I5M (Floxuridine)', '10028-17-8 (Tritium)', '2TN51YD919 (Hypoxanthine)', '76849-19-9 (CB 3717)', '935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)', 'EC 2.1.1.45 (Thymidylate Synthase)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)', 'W78I7AY22C (Deoxyuridine)']",,,,,,,

To further define this protective role conferred by the glucose moiety in bone marrow cells, we have replaced the nitrosourea cytotoxic group with another class of alkylating agent, a bifunctional nitrogen mustard. In a detailed structure-activity analysis, we have now characterized four analogues, with the mustard cytotoxic group positioned at carbon 2 [1,3,4,6-tetra-O-acetyl-2-(di-2-chloroethyl)amino-2-deoxy-D-glucopyranos e (TGM)], carbon 6, or carbon 1 (D- and L-isomers) of the aminoglucose molecule. On a molar basis, TGM was most toxic to normal BALB/c X DBA/2 F1 mice, with a 10% lethal dose (LD10) of 3.8 mumol/kg. The D- and L-isomers of 2,3,4,6-tetra-O-acetyl-N,N-bis(2-chloroethyl)glucopyranosylamine (C-1) were the least toxic, with an LD10 of 73 mumol/kg for both. Optimal antitumor activity against the murine P388 leukemia (single i.p. administration of the LD10) did not differ significantly among the four analogues, with increased life span ranging from 83-86%. P388 antitumor activity for nitrogen mustard (HN2) was significantly less, 60% increased life span (P = 0.01), while p-di(2-chloroethyl)amino-L-phenylalanine produced an increased life span of greater than 101%. An LD10 of 6-bis-(2-chloroethyl) amino-6-deoxy-D-glucose (C-6) or TGM produced significantly less depression of WBC counts than did an equitoxic dose of the C-1 isomers, HN2, or p-di(2-chloroethyl)amino-L-phenylalanine. The mean nadir WBC count for C-6 equaled 86% of control, and for TGM, 80% of control. Consistent with this sparing effect on the peripheral WBC, C-6 and TGM produced significantly less in vivo murine bone marrow DNA synthesis depression, 77 and 64% of control, respectively, as compared to the depression nadir produced by HN2 (27% of control), the D-isomer of C-1 (17%), the L-isomer of C-1 (18%), and p-di(2-chloroethyl)amino-L-phenylalanine (2%). These structure-activity studies demonstrate that conjugation of the mustard cytotoxic group to carbon 6 or carbon 2 of glucose produces an analogue that retains P388 antitumor activity significantly greater than that of HN2, with a concomitant reduction in murine bone marrow toxicity.",['1-RO1-CA17583/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (Amino Sugars)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Blood Glucose)', '0 (Nitrogen Mustard Compounds)', '3053LTY75Z (chlorozotocin)', '50D9XSG0VR (Mechlorethamine)', '5W494URQ81 (Streptozocin)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'Q41OR9510P (Melphalan)']",,,,,,,

After the s.c. tumor inoculation, it was suggested that both Ts and CTL were generated with target specificity against 203-glioma cells, because neither Ts nor CTL activity were seen against syngeneic EL 4 (benzpyrene-induced thymoma), allogeneic P815 (methylcholanthrene-induced mastocytoma of DBA/2 mouse origin) or YAC-1 (Moloney leukemia-induced T-cell lymphoma of A/Sn mouse origin), but only against 203-glioma. It was found that the generation of Ts preceded that of CTL and that the turnover was faster; furthermore, Ts were generated in the thymus and spleen, while CTL were distributed in regional lymph nodes and spleen. Surface marker analysis revealed that only Lyt-1-.2.3+ T-cells participated in suppressor responses in contrast to both Lyt-1-.2.3+ and Lyt-1+.2.3+ T-cells participating in cytotoxic responses. The effects of adult thymectomy (ATx) on the changes of the immunized T-cell subsets were also investigated. In mice thymectomized 3 weeks previously, the Ts activity was abrogated, whereas the CTL activity increased markedly and Lyt-1+.2.3+ T-cells were not detected. The results suggest that CTL or their precursors bearing Lyt-1+.2.3+ phenotype and Ts bearing Lyt-1-.2.3+ phenotype are short-lived lymphocytes. Accordingly, it is suggested that in tumor-bearing mice short-lived Ts are generated earliest with target specificity and, due to the reciprocal relationships between Ts and CTL activities, may have a modulating influence on CTL; furthermore, ATx may alter the patterns of generation of the precursor T-cells and Ts.",,"['0 (Isoantibodies)', '0 (Lyt antibodies)']",,,,,,,

Total intracellular NAD+ levels in P388D1 cells decreased with H2O2 concentrations of 40 microM or higher. Doses of H2O2 between 0.1 and 2.5 mM led to an 80% depletion of NAD within 20 min. With doses of H2O2 of 250 microM or lower, the fall in NAD and, as shown previously, ATP, was reversible. Higher doses of H2O2 that cause ultimate lysis of the cells, induced an irreversible depletion of NAD and ATP. Poly-ADP-ribose polymerase, a nuclear enzyme associated with DNA damage and repair, which catalyzes conversion of NAD to nicotinamide and protein-bound poly-ADP-ribose, was activated by exposure of the cells to concentrations of 40 microM H2O2 or higher. Activation of poly-ADP-ribose polymerase was also observed in peripheral lymphocytes incubated in the presence of phorbol myristate acetate-stimulated polymorphonuclear neutrophils. Examination of the possibility that DNA alteration was involved was performed by measurement of thymidine incorporation and determination of DNA single-strand breaks (SSB) in cells exposed to H2O2. H2O2 at 40 microM or higher inhibited DNA synthesis, and induced SSB within less than 30 s. These results suggest that DNA damage induced within seconds after addition of oxidant may lead to stimulation of poly-ADP-ribose polymerase, and a consequent fall in NAD. Excessive stimulation of poly-ADP-ribose polymerase leads to a fall in NAD sufficient to interfere with ATP synthesis.","['AI17354/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'HL16411/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL23584/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Culture Media)', '0 (DNA, Single-Stranded)', '0U46U6E8UK (NAD)', '25X51I8RD4 (Niacinamide)', '2P299V784P (Lead)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)']",,PMC424485,,,,,

Exposure of CCRF-CEM cells in exponential growth to 5-CH3-THF (1-100 microM) for 4 h and to FUra (250 microM) or FdUrd (0.5 microM) during the last 2 h resulted in having synergistic inhibitory effects on cell growth.

No clear dependency of synergy on sequence was observed with FUra and 5-CH3-THF combinations (4 h exposure, 5-CH3-THF----FUra, 5-CH3-THF + FUra, or FUra----5-CH3-THF).

Using chromatographically purified B cell growth factor (BCGF), HCL can be stimulated to proliferate as assessed by incorporation of tritiated thymidine [3HTdR] into DNA. Proliferation was found to be time dependent, with no detectable 3H-TdR incorporation in up to three days of culture, and significant stimulation evident at days 6 and 10. The presence of 10% BCGF in culture was an absolute requirement for HCL proliferation; however, this BCGF-induced DNA synthesis could be further augmented by the addition of anti-immunoglobulin heavy chain antibodies. BCGF-induced proliferation was abrogated in six of six patients by addition of 1,000 U/mL of recombinant alpha 2-interferon (IFN) at day 0, although 1,000 U/mL of recombinant gamma-IFN had no inhibitory effect in five of six patients studied. Specific cellular receptors for type I IFN were demonstrated in HCL by inhibition of binding of 125I-alpha 2-IFN by a 40-fold excess of unlabeled alpha 2 or beta IFN with no inhibition by unlabeled gamma-IFN.

The binding of iodinated recombinant interferon-alpha to baseline samples of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from the leukemia patients was compared with clinical responsiveness to rIFN-alpha A. HCL patients (8/10) responded to rIFN-alpha A therapy, whereas none (0/10) of the CLL patients studied responded. The PBMCs from the eight responsive HCL patients bound approximately twice as much iodinated interferon as the PBMCs from nonresponsive CLL patients. This difference was due to more high-affinity receptors per cell with no difference in the affinity of the interferon-receptor interaction. However, because PBMCs from HCL patients were larger than PBMCs from CLL patients, the cell surface receptor density was similar. The leukemic cells from one of the two nonresponsive HCL patients bound iodinated interferon similarly to the cells from the responsive HCL patients, whereas the leukemic cells from the other nonresponsive HCL patient bound considerably less. The rapidity of response of the HCL patients did not correlate with the level of binding of iodinated interferon. Our results suggest that the absolute number of interferon receptors per cell may be only one of several important parameters in the response to rIFN-alpha A therapy, and that the responsiveness of a particular lymphoproliferative disease or a particular patient to rIFN-alpha A therapy cannot be predicted or explained solely by the degree of interaction between IFN and its cell surface receptor.",['N01-CO-23910/CO/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Interferon)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",,,,,,,

The 125I-Mu-rIFN-gamma showed specific binding to L1210 cells. Scatchard analysis indicates about 4000 binding sites per cell and an apparent Kd of 5 X 10(-10)M. Binding of 125I-Mu-rIFN-gamma to cells was inhibited by both natural (glycosylated) and rIFN-gamma, but not by IFN-alpha/beta. Receptor-bound 125I-Mu-rIFN-gamma was rapidly internalized when incubation temperature was raised from 4 degrees C to 37 degrees C. On internalization, almost no IFN-gamma degradation was observed during 16 hr incubation. 125I-Mu-rIFN-gamma binding capacity decreased in cells preincubated with low doses of unlabeled Mu-rIFN-gamma, but not with IFN-alpha/beta. This receptor down-regulation was dose-dependent: 90% reduction of 125I-Mu-rIFN-gamma binding was observed after preincubation with 100 U/ml. After removal of IFN-gamma from the culture medium, the binding capacity increased with time. However, reappearance of receptor was completely blocked by cycloheximide or tunicamycin, suggesting that re-expression of receptors is not due to recycling but to the synthesis of new receptors, and that the receptor is probably a glycoprotein. Cross-linking of 125I-Mu-rIFN-gamma to surface L1210 cell proteins by using bifunctional agents yielded a predominant complex of m.w. 110,000 +/- 5000.

In logarithmically growing control tumor cells, the rate of in situ thymidylate synthase activity equaled the rate of DNA synthesis. However, in tumor cells incubated with growth-inhibitory concentrations of either FdUrd or 5,8-dideazaisofolic acid for 48 h, the rate of thymidylate synthase activity was between 15- and 17-fold greater than the rate of DNA synthesis. The loss in tumor cell viability of FdUrd-treated cells was temporally related to this prolonged dissociation of thymidylate biosynthesis from DNA biosynthesis. The dissociation of thymidylate from DNA biosynthesis in cells incubated with FdUrd was not closely related to thymidylate depletion. The intracellular concentrations and activities of thymidylate synthase were comparable in tumor cells incubated for 24 or 48 h with either a growth-inhibitory or non-growth-inhibitory concentration of FdUrd, indicating no direct relationship among these parameters. Indirect thymidylate depletion induced by the combination of 2,4-diamino-5-(3',4'-dichlorophenyl)-6-methylpyrimidine, hypoxanthine, and glycine inhibited in situ thymidylate synthase activity and DNA synthesis to an equal extent. In addition, the intracellular concentrations of all four deoxyribonucleoside 5'-triphosphates in tumor cells incubated with FdUrd for 48 h were between 1.3- and 3.1-fold greater than their respective concentrations in control cells, reflecting their decreased utilization in DNA synthesis in FdUrd-treated cells.

Treatment of patients suffering from hairy cell leukemia (HCL) with human recombinant alpha IFN results in significant tumor regression, with clinical improvement in a high percentage of cases. To investigate a possible relevance of binding parameters as response markers, IFN receptor interaction on tumor cells responsive to IFN in vivo was studied. Binding of human alpha 2 IFN to circulating hairy cells was analyzed before and during IFN therapy in ten patients selected on the basis of high numbers of peripheral hairy cells. Binding experiments were carried out on Ficoll-Paque fractionated peripheral cell samples containing a majority of hairy cells. All patients reacted to recombinant alpha IFN treatment with a striking decrease in binding capacity within 12 hours after the first injection. As demonstrated by using a monoclonal antibody able to recognize alpha 2 IFN bound to its receptor, this decreased binding capacity was not due to blocking by circulating IFN but rather to a decrease in receptor number. This receptor ""down-regulation"" was partially reversible after the first IFN injection. However, upon prolonged IFN therapy, all patients displayed a stable state of decreased receptor expression. Down-regulation of IFN receptors can be regarded as a response marker to IFN treatment. This response marker, however, was not correlated with the clinical response within the first months of IFN therapy.",,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Interferon)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",,,,,,,

Controls' cells were surface immunoglobulin (sIg)-positive, and some (mean, 25%) expressed la determinants. By Wright-Giemsa staining, they appeared as plasmacytoid cells. In contrast, patients' cells had predominantly a lymphoblastoid appearance, fewer cells had developed sIg, and a large fraction (mean, 43%) were Ia-positive. Moreover, the CALL antigen (CALLA) was expressed by a mean of 18% (range, 2% to 72%) of the patients' colony cells, whereas CALLA was never found in control colonies. Thus, cells with immature features persist in the colonies of CALL patients. Secondary colonies could be generated from the patients' cultured cells, indicating their self-renewal capacity. CALLA + cells were also present in the secondary colonies. Finally, cytogenetic studies showed that a fraction of the patients' colony cells had karyotypic abnormalities similar to that of the original lymphoblasts.

Although aberrations of chromosome 14 frequently are associated with lymphocytic malignancies, these abnormalities most often result in extra material on the long arm, 14q+. However, none of the five patients reported here had a 14q+. Cases 1 and 2 had t(9;14)(q34;q11) and t(11;14)(p11 or 13;q11), respectively. Case 3 showed del(14)(q11), and cases 4 and 5 showed inv(14)(q11q32). Structural aberrations resulting in 14q- and inv(14) appear to occur infrequently. The five cases in this report, in conjunction with those found in the literature, indicate a strong association between breaks at 14q11 and T lymphocytic malignancies.",,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', 'EC 3.4.24.11 (Neprilysin)']",,,,,,,

All cases met morphologic and cytochemical criteria for ALL, lacked detectable T cell surface antigens, and expressed HLA-DR (Ia) antigens. Eighty-three of the 93 patients (89%) were positive for the common acute lymphoblastic leukemia antigen (CALLA), and 20 of 91 (22%) tested had detectable cytoplasmic immunoglobulin. As expected, the heavy-chain lg gene was rearranged in all cases, and the pattern of rearrangements was variable; 23 had one allele rearranged and one in the germ line configuration; 15 had one rearranged and one deleted; and 37 had two rearranged. Unexpectedly, in 18 patients the presence of more than two mu gene-hybridizing bands was detected. Combinations of enzymes and heavy-chain gene probes were used to confirm that the extra bands were not the result of underdigestion of the DNA or DNA restriction site polymorphism. In eight of the 18 patients, we identified an extra chromosome 14 as a possible cause of the extra bands' hybridizing to the mu heavy-chain constant-region probe. In the remaining ten patients, the presence of three or four bands hybridizing with the mu probe suggests the presence of two populations of leukemic cells that may have arisen either by separate leukemic transformation events or by clonal evolution of one clone into two related lines. Although preliminary (2-year follow-up), our data suggest that childhood ALL of B lineage with more than two mu heavy-chain genes, but without extra copies of chromosome 14, may be more resistant to therapy.","['CA 20180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin mu-Chains)', 'EC 3.4.24.11 (Neprilysin)']",,,,,,,

It is a useful marker for distinguishing between clinically important types of acute leukemia. Anti-CALLA monoclonal antibodies (MoAb) also react with mature myeloid cells (granulocytes), where they identify an antigen having a similar molecular weight (mol wt). We now report that the antigens detected by anti-CALLA MoAb on human lymphoid and myeloid cells differ in their behavior and chemistry. Surface-labeling studies indicate that the antigen on lymphoid cells has a mol wt of approximately 100 kd v 110 kd for that on granulocytes. When cells are metabolically labeled with 35S-methionine, differences in the mol wt of these antigens are again observed. Unlike the lymphoid antigen, expression of that on purified granulocytes is not modulated by incubation with specific antibody. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of proteolytic digests of the two antigens fails to clarify their chemical relationship. Thus the antigens detected on these two cell types may share an epitope(s) but be chemically distinct, or CALLA may exist in distinct forms and behave differently on lymphoid cells and granulocytes.","['CA 15704/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 18221/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 30924/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']","['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', 'EC 3.4.24.11 (Neprilysin)']",,,,,,,

A monoclonal IgE was used to bind the fluorescent probe N-[5-(dimethylamino)naphthalene-1-sulfonyl]-L-lysine (DNS-Lys) rigidly and specifically in the antigen combining site at the tip of the Fab region. The average rotational correlation time, phi, of 74-89 ns for the receptor-bound IgE is only slightly longer than that for IgE in solution where phi = 54 ns. Another mouse monoclonal IgE was covalently labeled in the Fab region with N-(1-pyrenyl)maleimide. Anisotropy measurements with this derivative yielded results that are very similar to those found with anti-DNS IgE and DNS-Lys. These findings are strikingly different from that expected for a rigid IgE bound to its receptor since in this case phi is likely to be very much larger.

The Avidin-Biotin system was employed. The immunoenzymatic results were in agreement with those obtained with immunofluorescence techniques for all antigens except common-ALL (C-ALL). The C-ALL antigen, recognized by the J5 antibody, was detected only by the immunoperoxidase method on cell membranes of the 4 ALL. This paper discusses the possibility of false negative results in testing for C-ALL antigen by conventional indirect immunofluorescence as suggested by refined immunocytochemical screening. Moreover, the ability of the immunoperoxidase system to identify antigens on cell membranes, even at very low density, is discussed.

Addition of a monoclonal anti-IgE(Fc) antibody to IgE-sensitized cells in stoichiometric amounts relative to IgE produces IgE-receptor dimers with high efficiency. These dimers are nearly as mobile as IgE-receptor monomers and trigger cellular degranulation poorly, but in the presence of 30% D2O, substantial immobilization of the dimers is seen and degranulation activity doubles. Addition of this monoclonal antibody in larger amounts results in the formation of larger oligomeric receptor clusters which are immobile and effectively trigger the cells. Thus, small receptor clusters that are active in stimulating degranulation are immobilized in a process that is not anticipated by simple hydrodynamic theories. Further experiments involving cross-linking of receptor-bound IgE by multivalent antigen demonstrate that immobilization of receptors occurs rapidly (less than 2 min) upon cross-linking and is fully and rapidly reversible by the addition of excess monovalent hapten. The rapidity and reversibility of the immobilization process are entirely consistent with the possibility that immobilization represents a recognition event between clustered receptors and cytoskeleton-associated components that plays an important role early in the cell triggering mechanism.","['AI18306/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI18610/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'GM33028/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic)', '0 (Cross-Linking Reagents)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '333DO1RDJY (Serotonin)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)']",,PMC2114094,,,,,

The loss of this protein during erythroid differentiation was correlated with loss of cellular adhesion to fibronectin. Both MEL cells and reticulocytes attached to the same site on fibronectin as do fibroblasts since adhesion of erythroid cells to fibronectin was specifically blocked by a monoclonal antibody directed against the cell-binding fragment of fibronectin and by a synthetic peptide containing the Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser sequence found in the cell-binding fragment of fibronectin. Erythroid cells attached specifically to surfaces coated either with the 115-kD cell-binding fragment of fibronectin or with the synthetic peptide-albumin complex.

We have reported that chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) T4 cells help and CLL T8 cells lack suppressor effects on Ig synthesis by normal B cells (Blood 62:767, 1983). We have now explored the earlier phase, proliferation, using B cell colony formation; in semisolid media. B lymphocyte colonies from normal individuals and from patients with CLL were grown in 0.3% agarose overlayed with T cells or T cell subsets and the B cell mitogen staphylococcal protein A. Enriched T cells, OKT4 or OKT8, were obtained either by sheep erythrocyte rosettes or depletion of OKT8 or OKT4 cells by monoclonal antibody or complement, respectively. Twenty thousand B cells from normal subjects yielded 65 +/- 9, 64 +/- 7, and 19 +/- 6 colonies with autologous unfractionated T-, OKT4-, or OKT8-positive cells, respectively. This compared to 29 +/- 11, 81 +/- 11, and 15 +/- 4 colonies from patients with CLL with added autologous unfractionated T-, OKT4-, or OKT8-positive cells. To determine whether the fewer number of colonies in both normal subjects and patients with CLL with OKT8-positive cells was due to suppression or lack of help, the number of OKT4-positive cells was held constant, and OKT8-positive cells were added in increasing numbers. No suppression of colony formation could be demonstrated. Furthermore, the addition of increasing numbers of concanavalin A (Con A)-activated OKT8-positive cells did not suppress colony formation. These results suggest that the CLL T cell subsets behave in a functionally similar manner to normal T cell subsets, namely, (1) that normal and CLL B cell colony growth is helped by OKT4 cells; and (2) in contrast to immunoglobulin secretion by B cells, neither normal nor CLL OKT8 cells, unstimulated or activated by Con A, suppress B cell colony growth.",,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '11028-71-0 (Concanavalin A)']",,,,,,,

In 14 patients with advanced B-CLL (stage III or IV) we found the T cell response in the autologous (auto) and allogeneic (allo) mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) to be 35.7% and 30% of the controls, respectively. Proliferation in the MLR depends upon the production of and response to interleukin 2 (IL 2), a T cell growth factor. IL 2 production in eight B-CLL patients was 22% of the control. The response to IL 2 was measured by the increase in the T cell proliferation in the MLR with the addition of IL 2. T cell proliferation in both the auto and allo MLR of CLL patients was significantly lower than in the controls after the addition of IL 2. The proliferative response of normal T cells to stimulation by CLL B cells was 50% of the control. This latter response was increased to control levels when cultures were supplemented with exogenous IL 2, suggesting that CLL B cells could stimulate IL 2 receptor generation in normal T cells in an allo MLR, but not IL 2 production. The presence of IL 2 receptors on activated T cells was directly determined using anti-Tac, a monoclonal antibody with specificity for the IL 2 receptor. Of the mitogen- or MLR-activated T cells in CLL patients, 6% and 10%, respectively, expressed Tac antigen, whereas identically stimulated control T cells were 60% and 47% Tac+, respectively. Our findings suggest that T cells in B-CLL are defective in their recognition of self or foreign major histocompatibility antigens as demonstrated by their impaired responsiveness in the MLR.

In order to test this possibility, two monoclonal antibodies were employed that bind specifically to rat IgE (IgER) when IgER is in solution and when it is bound to receptors on the plasma membrane. The F(ab')2 fragment of one monoclonal (B5) that is specific for the Fab region of IgER was labeled with donor probes and bound to IgER, and the quenching of the fluorescence of these donors due to simultaneous binding of the Fab' fragment of an anti-Fc monoclonal (A2) that was labeled with an acceptor probe at its interchain disulfide bond was measured. Significantly less energy transfer between these probes was observed when IgER was bound to its receptor on membrane vesicles than when it was free in solution, and this result is interpreted in light of other energy-transfer measurements using A2 and B5 that were preferentially labeled near their combining sites with donors and acceptors, respectively, as well as measurements of the distance of closest approach between these sites and the membrane surface.

It has been mainly found on the membrane of leukemic lymphoblasts, but not on that of normal circulating lymphocytes. Circadian rhythmicity in circulating CALLA-positive (CALLA+) lymphocytes was investigated in five healthy male subjects. Blood was sampled every 4 h for 24 h in each subject. Seven times series were obtained (three for the same subject). Leukocyte and differential counts were determined, and mononucular cells (greater than 95% lymphocytes) were isolated in Ficoll-Paque gradient. CALLA+ cells were characterized with both J5 and VILA1 monoclonal antibodies. Other T- and B-cell subpopulations were also determined in the same samples. Up to 1160 +/- 498 (mean +/- 1 S.E.M) J5-labelled CALLA+ lymphocytes per mm3 were found in peripheral blood at night. At this time, circulating VILA1-labelled CALLA+ lymphocytes also reached their peak although with a much lower number (66 +/- 14 cells/mm3). A circadian rhythm (with a period identical to 24h) was statistically validated with several methods for the number of J5-labelled cells, that of VILA1-labelled cells and the J5: VILA1 ratio. The count of J5-labelled CALLA+ cells was correlated with that of total lymphocytes, total T (OKT3+) and inducer T (OKT4+) cells (p less than 0.01), but neither with suppressor/cytotoxic cells (OKT8+) nor with B cells (SIg+, B1+, B2+, or HLA-Dr+). No correlation was found between any of these lymphocyte subpopulation and the count of VILA1-labelled CALLA+ cells. Such results further support the hypothesis that VILA1 and J5 monoclonal antibodies do not bind to the same epitope of the CALLA molecule. The large nocturnal increase in circulating J5-labelled CALLA+ lymphocytes may be accounted for by a release of immature presumably T lymphocytes in the peripheral blood.",,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', 'EC 3.4.24.11 (Neprilysin)']",,,,,,,

The classic opiate antagonist naloxone blocked the enhancing effect when used at a 100-fold molar excess relative to b-end. Neither a-end nor g-end could augment NK activity, whereas D-ALA2-b-end produced an enhancement comparable with that produced by b-end. In addition, incubation of LGL with b-end in the presence of phytohemagglutinin or poly I:C significantly augmented IFN production. These findings demonstrate that b-end enhances NK activity and IFN production of purified LGL, and suggests that b-end might bind to an opioid receptor on LGL that can be blocked by naloxone.

We previously showed that unlike some other ligands, the binding of monomeric rat or mouse IgE to RBL cells does not induce endocytosis. However, aggregation of the cell-bound, monomeric mouse IgE anti-dinitrophenyl (DNP) with DNP-protein conjugates leads to endocytosis of the aggregated mouse IgE and to the co-endocytosis of some unaggregated monomeric rat IgE. In this study we analyzed and compared the fate of co-endocytosed and endocytosed IgE. We found that co-endocytosed rat IgE recycled back to the cell surface within 3 to 4 hr. In contrast, endocytosed, immunochemically cross-linked, receptor-bound mouse IgE anti-DNP was partially degraded and was released into the medium, with no observable recycling of receptors, by 3 hr. However, addition of the hapten, DNP-lysine, resulted in rapid recycling (t1/2 10 min) of the endocytosed receptor-bound IgE to the plasma membrane and blocked additional endocytosis. Recycling of the endocytosed mouse IgE was more pronounced when the hapten was added to cells within 20 min of the initiation of endocytosis. When the hapten was added to the cells at later times (60 to 180 min), progressively less IgE recycled to the surface. This may reflect shuttling of the internalized IgE from a 'prelysosomal' to a 'lysosomal' compartment. Thus we provide evidence for recycling of monomeric IgE receptor complexes, sorting between cross-linked and non-cross-linked IgE receptor complexes, the freeing of receptor-bound monomeric IgE from the endocytosed immune-complexed IgE, and the apparent dependence of the recycling efficiency upon intracellular localization.",,"['0 (Antigen-Antibody Complex)', '0 (Cross-Linking Reagents)', '0 (Dinitrobenzenes)', '0 (Dinitrophenols)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Serum Albumin)', '0 (dinitrophenyl-human serum albumin conjugate)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)']",,,,,,,

To examine potential reasons for the poor prognosis of affected infants, clinical and biologic features of their ALL were compared. Infants had higher WBC counts (P less than .001), a higher incidence of massive splenomegaly (P less than .001), massive hepatomegaly (P less than .001), more central nervous system (CNS) disease at diagnosis (P less than .01), and lower platelet counts (P less than .001). Also, their blasts were less often PAS+ (P = .02). The incidence of non(T, B, pre-B), T and pre-B immunophenotypes of ALL did not differ significantly between the two groups. However, in patients with non(T, B, pre-B) ALL, the majority (51%) of infants had common ALL antigen (CALLA)-negative blasts, as compared with only 7% in group 1 (P less than .001). Furthermore, infants with non(T, B, pre-B) cell ALL who were less than 12 months of age were almost always CALLA- (18 of 21). The blasts of children from both groups usually expressed Ia-like antigens. These data illustrate that infants with ALL have extensive and bulky disease more often than do older children and are more often affected with a prognostically unfavorable phenotype of acute leukemia (AL) which expresses Ia-like antigens but is more often PAS- and CALLA-. We believe that these clinical and biological differences predict and explain in part the observed poor response to treatment of infants with ALL.","['CA-15989/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-25408/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-29139/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']","['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)', 'EC 3.4.24.11 (Neprilysin)']",,,,,,,

The cytochemical studies showed that blasts from seven of the adult ALL patients were dense-granular-positive (DG-positive) for beta-glucuronidase, whereas the blasts from the children were negative except for one (with T-ALL). In the adults with common ALL (cALL), survival of patients DG-positive for this enzyme were significantly shorter than that of eight patients with a scattered granular pattern (p less than 0.05). The mean ratio between the percentage of blasts positive for cALL antigen (cALLA) to that of blasts positive for terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) in the adult group with cALL (0.6 +/- 0.3) was significantly lower (p less than 0.01) than in the group of children with cALL (1.1 +/- 0.2) or in the lymphoid-crisis group (1.5 +/- 1.0). These findings indicate that adult cALL consists of two distinct subpopulations, one with less differentiated phenotype (cALL-/TdT+) and the other with more (cALL+/TdT+). In contrast, the blast cells in childhood cALL and some patients in lymphoid crisis had a relatively homogeneous population with the latter phenotypes. The results suggest that the clonotypic cells in adult ALL, particularly in cALL, appear to be more immature than those in childhood ALL.

The present studies test if mitotic cells also resist functional responses to cell surface ligand-receptor interactions. The IgE receptors of RBL-2H3 rat basophilic leukemia cells were labeled with anti-dinitrophenol IgE (anti-DNP-IgE) and then cross-linked with multivalent ligands (DNP-bovine serum albumin [BSA]; DNP-B-phycoerythrin; DNP-BSA-gold). IgE-receptor cross-linking modulates cell surface organization and function and releases serotonin and other mediators of allergic and asthmatic reactions from interphase cells (Pfeiffer, J. R., JC. Seagrave, B. H. Davis, G. G. Deanin, and J. M. Oliver, 1985, J. Cell Biol., 101:2145-2155). It was found that anti-DNP-IgE-receptor complexes are preserved on the cell surface throughout mitosis; they continue to bind DNP-proteins, and the resulting antigen-IgE-receptor complexes can redistribute to coated pits on the cell surface. Furthermore, there is no loss of [3H]serotonin through mitosis. Nevertheless, antigen-stimulated [3H]-serotonin release is strongly impaired in mitotic-enriched as compared with mixed interphase or G1-enriched cell populations. In addition, antigen binding transforms the surface of interphase cells from a microvillous to a plicated topography and stimulates the uptake of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated dextran by fluid pinocytosis. Mitotic cells maintain a microvillous surface topography after antigen treatment, and fluid pinocytosis virtually ceases from prometaphase to telophase. Phorbol myristate acetate, a tumor promoter that activates protein kinase C, restores surface ruffling activity to mitotic cells. Thus, the mitosis-specific freezing of membrane and secretory responses is most likely due to the failure of transmembrane signaling.",['ES-03338/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (Receptors, Fc)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '333DO1RDJY (Serotonin)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,PMC2114003,,,,,

We have used dinitrophenol-conjugated bovine serum albumin (DNP-BSA) as well as the fluorescent antigen, DNP-B-phycoerythrin, and the electron-dense antigen, DNP-BSA-gold, to investigate dynamic membrane and cytoskeletal events associated with the release of [3H]serotonin from anti-DNP-IgE-primed RBL-2H3 cells. These multivalent antigens bind rapidly to cell surface IgE-receptor complexes. Their distribution is initially uniform, but within 2 min DNP-BSA-gold is found in coated pits and is subsequently internalized. Antigen internalization occurs in the presence and absence of extracellular Ca2+. The F-actin content of the detergent-extracted cell matrices analyzed by SDS PAGE decreases during the first 10-30 s of antigen binding and then increases by 1 min to almost double the control levels. A rapid and sustained increase is also observed when total F-actin is quantified by flow cytometry after binding of rhodamine-phalloidin. The antigen-stimulated increase in F-actin coincides with (and may cause) the transformation of the cell surface from a finely microvillous to a highly folded or plicated topography. Other early membrane responses include increased cell spreading and a 2-3-fold increase in the uptake of fluorescein-dextran by fluid pinocytosis. The surface and F-actin changes show the same dependence on DNP-protein concentration as stimulated [3H]serotonin release; and both the membrane responses and the release of mediators are terminated by the addition of the non-cross-linking monovalent ligand, DNP-lysine. These data indicate that the same antigen-stimulated transduction pathway controls both the membrane/cytoskeletal and secretory events. However, the membrane and actin responses to IgE-receptor cross-linking are independent of extracellular Ca2+ and are mimicked by phorbol myristate acetate, whereas ligand-dependent mediator release depends on extracellular Ca2+ and is mimicked by the Ca2+ ionophore A23187.",['CA 36646/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '333DO1RDJY (Serotonin)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)']",,PMC2113986,,,,,

With techniques that preserve architecture, difficult diagnostic cases characterized by core but not aspirate involvement, or the reverse, were resolved. By means of an extensive battery of monoclonal antibodies applied to serial sections, complex tumor cell phenotypes were established in all 23 cases. In addition to the identification of straightforward monoclonal surface immunoglobulin expression in small cleaved cell lymphomas (four cases), the battery approach added immunologic certainty in malignancies with unusual or difficult phenotypes: peripheral T-cell lymphomas with idiosyncratic antigen expression, and chronic lymphocytic leukemias and small cell lymphomas with faint surface immunoglobulin expression (four cases). For the chronic lymphocytic leukemias and the small cell lymphomas, the combined IgD+, B2+, B1+, Ia+, Leu-1+ phenotype taken as a whole had greater utility than any isolated marker. The acute lymphocytic leukemias and the myelomas studied demonstrate the wide range of B-cell antigens that must be detected to account for the variety of B-cell neoplasms encountered. Additionally, the previously undescribed phenotypic subset of CALLA+ myelomas, which is of prognostic relevance, was identified.

In this study, we have assessed the frequency, phenotypic features, and functional capabilities of such cells in a variety of lymphoid malignancies or solid tumors. In each patient group, the percentage of granular lymphocytes within the Leu 3/T 4+ T-helper subset was significantly increased. A large percentage of these cells coexpressed the Leu 7 or Leu 15 marker. When Leu 3+ cells from patients with high proportions of such NK-like cells (or Leu 3+-Leu 15+ cells from selected patients) were isolated with a fluorescence-activated cell sorter, these cells did not proliferate in response to allogeneic cells or T-cell mitogens, nor did they provide help for B-cell differentiation. They also did not suppress T-cell proliferative responses or B-cell differentiation. Freshly prepared Leu 3+ granular lymphocytes did not display NK-cell cytotoxic functions. However, after short-term culture in the presence of phytohemagglutinin (PHA), Leu 3+-Leu 15+ cells expressed T-cell growth factor (TCGF) receptors, had a detectable proliferative response to exogenous TCGF, and acquired the ability to lyse NK-cell targets. These studies demonstrate that, in a variety of malignancies, the lymphocyte subpopulation expressing the T-helper (Leu 3/T 4+) phenotype may be comprised largely of cells with NK-like features and functional capabilities distinct from those of classical helper T cells.","['CA 13148/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 16673/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)']",,,,,,,

This precursor contains snRNP peptides D, E, F, and G, which are common to all the different U RNA-containing particles. Furthermore, a posttranslational modification of one of the U1 snRNP-specific peptides has been observed, and the kinetics of this process indicates that the modification occurs after particle assembly.

Chromosomal analysis revealed multiple abnormalities which progressively increased in number as the marrow lymphocytosis became more prominent. Subsequently he developed small bowel infiltration. A splenectomy resulted in only brief improvement in the neutropenia. Immunopathologic examination of the spleen was consistent with a well-differentiated lymphocytic lymphoma of a mature peripheral T-cell type without subset specific markers. Granulocyte-monocyte colony (CFU-GM) formation from the patient's marrow was normal and not augmented by T-cell depletion. Neither the patient's splenic T-cells nor serum suppressed granulopoiesis. In contrast to previous T-LPD with neutropenia whose malignant nature has been questioned, the clinical, cytogenetic, and pathologic features and course in this case indicate a malignant lymphoid process which was effectively treated with chemotherapy.

TdT and HLA-DR are expressed throughout the stages of B cell differentiation represented by 'non-B, non-T' ALL. The earliest B cell antigen appears to be Leu 12 (B4) followed by BA-2 and then BL2. OKB2, BL1 and BA-1 are acquired next, followed by B1, BL3, cALLa and Cu. BL7 appears just prior to SIg. OKB1, OKB4, OKB7 and BL4 appear at or after the time of SIg expression and hence are not expressed by 'non-B, non-T' ALL cells. This developmental hierarchy is supported by the results of phorbol ester (TPA) induction studies. Thus, cases of 'non-B, non-T' ALL constitute a useful model for probing the hierarchal expression of B cell antigens and delineating the B cell developmental pathway(s).",['EY03357/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin mu-Chains)', 'EC 2.7.7.31 (DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase)', 'EC 3.4.24.11 (Neprilysin)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,,,,,,

It is a gradually debilitating illness with no known cure. The first symptom is usually a slowly increasing memory loss, beginning between 40 and 65 years of age. As the disease progresses, the brain begins to deteriorate more rapidly, until it literally stops functioning. Of great concern is the projection that the number of people who will have Alzheimer's disease will double by the year 2030 because of the rising elderly population. Treating this population will escalate from the current estimate in excess of $2.5 billion to more than $6 billion. Speculation toward the increasing costs in money and workforce has led to an accelerated program in search of a cure or at least a symptomatic therapy for this condition. One of the most promising research leads is the striking connection between Alzheimer's disease and Down's syndrome and certain cancers: --Virtually 100% of patients with Down's syndrome who survive past age 35 show the same mental deterioration and identical brain changes seen in patients with Alzheimer's disease, including the presence of plaque and neurofibrillary tangles.--The presence of a high percentage of Down's syndrome among relatives of patients with Alzheimer's disease. --A high incidence of certain types of syndrome and among relatives of people who have Alzheimer's disease, such as leukemia, lymphomas, Hodgkin's disease, and immune system disorders. The key to the intercorrections between Alzheimer's disease and Down's syndrome seems to be a genetic component related to chromosome 21.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",,,,,,,,,

For the majority, treatment of orthodontic problems is feasible, but special precautions usually are required. These include medical consultation to establish the patient's prognosis, maintaining a current knowledge of drug therapy, and modifications in office procedures. Patients with a history of multiple transfusions should be presumed to be hepatitis carriers until proved not to be, and special precautions to protect office staff members and other patients should be taken. Decreased resistance to infection is a common complicating factor in medically compromised patients. Dentists must therefore avoid mucosal irritation and carefully monitor periodontal health. The practitioner should be alert to side effects of drug treatment such as xerostomia and depressed immune response, and be aware of the particular features of the underlying disease. Bleeding disorders, which can be managed by replacement of missing clotting factors, do not contraindicate orthognathic surgery. The major contraindication is poor anesthetic risk, which almost always is true for patients having sickle cell anemia because of poor blood oxygen saturation. Because orthodontic treatment can provide positive benefits, it should not be withheld solely because of the presence of a serious medical problem. With appropriate management, successful orthodontic treatment can be done for most patients.",,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, many of these triplets tended to occur in the same side of the DNA helix, suggesting that DNA curvature was involved in the preferred sites for nucleosome assembly. Consistent was the observation that DNA fragments carrying these preferred sites showed anomalous electrophoretic mobilities at a low temperature.",,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Nucleosomes)']",,,"['Institute for Chemical Research, Kyoto University, Japan.']",,,,

At diagnosis, 11 patients had splenomegaly, 11 had enlarged lymph nodes, and 15 patients had central nervous system (CNS) disease, of whom 10 had mental neuropathy. Anaemia was found in 13 patients, thrombocytopenia in 17 and the median white cell count was 25.5 x 10(9)/I (range 8.6-89). Surface immunoglobulins were found on the blasts of every patient. Seventeen patients had a t(8;14) (q24;q32) translocation. One had an apparently normal karyotype, but only six mitoses could be examined. During the period of the study different treatment protocols, which comprised increasingly intensive systemic and CNS chemotherapy, were used. Six patients died less than 3 weeks after admission, two of them of acute tumour lysis syndrome and two of CNS haemorrhage. In two other patients, rapid progression of CNS leukaemia was seen in spite of the treatment. Ten patients (56%) achieved complete remission (CR). Two were allografted and two were autografted early in CR. Four patients relapsed, three of the four relapses involving the CNS. A median actuarial disease-free survival was not attained, and a plateau was achieved at 57% after 7 months, with no later relapse. Median actuarial survival of the 18 patients was only 6 months, but a plateau was obtained at 31% after 11 months. Prognosis seemed related to the intensity of chemotherapy: recent patients, treated more aggressively, achieved CR more often than earlier patients, treated with less intensive protocols, although the number of patients was too small to draw any firm conclusion. The initial white cell count was also a prognostic factor, as none of the patients with more than 30 x 10(9)/I leucocytes achieved CR. Our results suggest that the outcome of adult L3 ALL can be improved, as in children, by increased intensity of treatment, particularly with regard to CNS leukaemia therapy. Early deaths are still frequent, however, but their incidence can probably be reduced by better prevention and early management of the acute tumour lysis syndrome.",,,,,"['Service des Maladies du Sang, C.H.U., Lille, France.']",,['Br J Haematol. 1989 Aug;72(4):593.

By 30 h of culture, approximately 20% of the unfractionated B-CLL cells were affected.

A series of analogs of the parent compound were synthesized and evaluated in a number of in vitro and in vivo biological assays to define the structure-activity relationships of this class of compounds relative to their potential therapeutic activities. In a colony-forming assay using HT-29 human colon carcinoma cells various analogs in which carbon replaced germanium (e.g. carbon) retained the potent cytotoxic activity in vitro seen with spirogermanium. Increased cytotoxic potency within the group of carbon containing analogs was directly related to increase in the length of the alkyl group(s) attached to the carbon atom opposite the azaspirane ring structure. DNA and protein synthesis by HT-29 cells was inhibited by these compounds. However, inhibition occurred only at supralethal concentrations or after long exposure times with the drug. None of the azaspiranes demonstrated in vivo anti-tumor activity against P388 leukemia or ADJ-PC6 plasmacytoma. The effect of these compounds on macrophage cell function was evaluated in vitro by their ability to modulate superoxide (O2-) production by macrophages. Spirogermanium inhibited the production of O2- by activated macrophages with an IC50 of 5 microM. Although macrophage viability did not appear to be decreased at the respective IC50 concentrations, the rank order potency for the analogs in the O2- production assay was directly proportional to that measured for their cytotoxic potency in the HT-29 colony formation assay. The results demonstrate that, within this class of compounds, (1) potent biological activity does not require the presence of germanium in the structure; (2) in vitro cytotoxic activity does not appear to be a direct result of the inhibition of macromolecular synthesis, and (3) macrophage function can be modulated in vitro at non-cytotoxic concentrations. These results are discussed in context with the reported anti-tumor activity of spirogermanium and the potential anti-arthritic and immunomodulatory activity of this class of compounds.",,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Organometallic Compounds)', '0 (Spiro Compounds)', '1F01P3Y61E (spirogermanium)']",,,"['Department of Molecular Pharmacology, Smith Kline & French Laboratories, King of Prussia, PA 19406-0939.']",,,,

Central venous access ports or partly implanted silicone catheters are usually placed for high-dose chemotherapy in these children. We report two patients aged 7 and 3 years with acute lymphoblastic beta-cell leukemia (B-ALL), a less common subtype of ALL, which presented with hyperthermia (38.4 degrees C and 39 degrees C) during anesthesia with isoflurane for implantation of a central venous catheter. The hyperthermic reactions were accompanied by an increase in expired CO2 and acidosis as well as moderate elevation of heart rate and blood pressure. As in both patients the history and preoperative findings did not reveal signs of infection or other causes of fever, the observed alterations were interpreted as symptoms of malignant hyperthermia triggered either by succinylcholine or isoflurane, which were used in both children. In addition, the hyperthermia responded to administration of dantrolene sodium according to dose recommendations for treatment of malignant hyperthermia. In one of the patients, withdrawal of dantrolene during the initial postoperative hours was followed by a recurrent increase in body temperature, which once again could be suppressed by additional dantrolene infusion. According to the literature, malignant hyperthermia has occasionally been described in children with malignancies such as leukemia or Burkitt's lymphoma. Our observations indicate that children with B-ALL may be especially susceptible to malignant hyperthermia. Close monitoring of body temperature and expiratory CO2 are therefore indicated in these children, and dantrolene therapy should be started immediately in case of increased temperature during anesthesia.",,['CYS9AKD70P (Isoflurane)'],,,"['Abteilung Anaesthesiologie und Operative Intensivmedizin, Klinikum der Justus-Liebig-Universitat Giessen.']",Hypertherme Reaktion in der perioperativen Phase bei zwei Kindern mit akuter lymphoblastischer Leukamie vom B-Zelltyp.,,,

Five patients (15%) had no evidence of definite malignant immunoproliferative disorders at the time of recognition of BJ proteinuria. Three of them, who were excreting steadily low amounts of BJ protein in their urine for 47, 61, and 73 months, respectively, without development of any B-lymphocytic malignancy, were classified as having a monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance. In the remaining two patients, BJ protein disappeared spontaneously 14 and 18 months, respectively, after its recognition. The study indicates that pure BJ proteinuria, even when occurring at low concentration, is most consistently associated with malignant proliferations of B-lymphocytic origin.

At this time, the ability to demonstrate the gene rearrangement is limited to a few research laboratories. The problem results partially from unfamiliarity of medical laboratory personnel with DNA technology, but more because of the restricted use of radiolabeled phosphorus in hospital laboratories. With the introduction of biotinylated deoxynucleotides, nucleic acid hybridization procedures can now be performed without the use of radioisotopically labeled gene probes. This article describes the use of biotin-labeled gene probes to detect the gene rearrangement of the breakpoint cluster region of chromosome 22 in chronic myelogenous leukemia. The techniques are reproducible, sensitive, and safe.

The antitumor activity of encapsulated doxorubicin (former generic name, adriamycin) was compared with that of the free drug in a murine hepatic and pulmonary tumor model. This was obtained by intrasplenic injection of L1210 lymphoma cells followed by splenectomy. Different schedules of treatment of tumor-bearing mice with erythrocyte-encapsulated or free doxorubicin were investigated. The optimal schedule of treatment for free doxorubicin proved to be i.v. bolus administration on the day of splenectomy. Under these conditions, the dose producing 50% inhibition of metastatic growth in the liver, as measured by inhibition of 5-[125I]iodo-2'-deoxyuridine uptake 9 days after tumor induction, was 6.3 mg/kg for free doxorubicin and 0.48 mg/kg for the encapsulated drug. In these conditions pulmonary tumor development was even more efficiently prevented by encapsulated doxorubicin as compared with the free drug. The values of the therapeutic index (TI), defined as the ratio between the maximal tolerated dose (LD10) and the minimal effective dose (ED90, producing 90% inhibition of liver metastatic growth), were 4.2 and 1.8 for encapsulated and free doxorubicin, respectively.",,"['80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 2.6.1.1 (Aspartate Aminotransferases)', 'EC 2.6.1.2 (Alanine Transaminase)', 'EC 2.7.3.2 (Creatine Kinase)']",,PMC286842,"['Institute of Biochemistry, University of Genoa, Italy.']",,,,

In proliferating cells, these genes are transcribed throughout the cell cycle, and both the more distal site I and the proximal site II are occupied by promoter-binding factors. In this report we demonstrate that during the shutdown of proliferation and onset of differentiation of the human promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL-60 into cells that exhibit phenotypic properties of monocytes, histone gene expression is down-regulated at the level of transcription. In vivo occupancy of site I by promoter factors persists in the differentiated HL-60 cells, but protein-DNA interactions at site II are selectively lost. Furthermore, in vitro binding activity of the site II promoter factor HiNF-D is lost in differentiated cells, and nuclear extracts from differentiated cells do not support in vitro transcription of these histone genes. Our results suggest that the interaction of HiNF-D with proximal promoter site II sequences plays a primary role in rendering cell growth-regulated histone genes transcribable in proliferating cells. It appears that while cell-cycle control of histone gene expression is mediated by both transcription and mRNA stability, with the shutdown of proliferation and onset mRNA stability, with the shutdown of proliferation and onset of differentiation, histone gene expression is regulated at the transcriptional level.",['GM32010/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (Histones)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",,PMC286805,"['Department of Cell Biology, University of Massachusetts Medical Center, Worcester 01655.']",,,,

We show that, upon addition of hemin (an efficient iron donor) to the cell culture, the rate of ferritin biosynthesis reaches a maximum after a few hours and then decreases. During a 24-hr incubation with the iron donor the concentrations of total ferritin heavy (H) and light (L) subunit mRNAs rise 2- to 5-fold and 2- to 3-fold, respectively, over the control values, while the amount of the protein increases 10- to 30-fold. The hemin-induced increment in ferritin subunit mRNA is not prevented by deferoxamine, suggesting that it is not directly mediated by chelatable iron. In vitro nuclear transcription analyses performed on nuclei isolated from control cells and cells grown in the presence of hemin indicate that the rates of synthesis of H- and L-subunit mRNAs remain constant. We conclude that iron-induced ferritin biosynthesis is governed by multiple post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms.

P is a stimulus needed for renewal of hemopoietic cells. When illegally autocatalytic for P any mitotically competent cell (not necessarily pluripotent, at least originally) acquires the marginal (seldom complete) autonomous growth of malignant cells. Rather than confrontational, these views complement advantageously the mutation model and account for certain peculiarities of (human) leukemic cells, such as the propensity to differentiate terminally when isolated from their in vivo microenvironments. In addition, we discuss the rare occurrence of certain human leukemias (e.g., erythroleukemias and polycythemia veras) comparatively to the surprisingly more frequent chronic and acute myelogenous leukemias. This occurs in spite of the similarity between erythroid and myeloid populations in terms of size (mass of cells) and number of targets at mutational risk.

Most of these heritable viral genes are not expressed, and expression, when observed, is commonly limited to envelope (env) genes as demonstrated by the presence of cell surface and serum envelope glycoprotein (gp70) in mice. Studies of the mouse have shown that certain tissues such as the reproductive tract and lymphoid organs are common sites for the expression of endogenous env genes, suggesting that the transcription of at least some endogenous sequences is tissue specific. The transcription of endogenous viral genes is regulated by both cis and trans mechanisms (2-5) and their expression can be temporally linked to differentiation and development (6-8). The consequences to the host of endogenous retroviral genes are varied. At one extreme, expression of endogenous virus can result in the development of leukemia and death. Another potentially detrimental effect is that of insertional mutagenesis, seen when the integration of retroviral sequences interrupts the functioning of a cellular gene (9, 10). However, it is now clear that expression of endogenous retroviral genes may also have a beneficial effect for the host: namely, mediating resistance to retroviral leukemias as has been demonstrated for the Fv-4 gene in mice (11) and some ea loci in chickens (12). This form of resistance is due to the blockage of cellular viral receptors by the expression of envelope glycoprotein on the cell surface. The Rmcf locus of the mouse is another resistance gene that may exert its effect by the expression of an endogenous env gene. A summary of our current state of knowledge concerning the Rmcf gene is shown in Table I. The Rmcf gene was originally described when it was observed that fibroblast cell cultures derived from certain strains of mice restricted the replication of recombinant mink cell focus-forming(MCF)1 viruses (13). As detailed in Table I, DBA/2 mice are the prototypic strain exhibiting the Rmcf resistance (Rmcf(r)) phenotype. Cell cultures from other strains, such as C57BL/6 and IRW, are permissive for MCF viral replication and are termed Rmcf sensitive (Rmcf(s)). Previously, we described two allelic forms of an endogenous env gene, whose expression is linked to the Rmcf gene (14). Cell cultures from Rmcf(r) mice express gp70 related to that of MCF viruses, whereas cultures derived from Rmcf(s) mice either express no gp70 (IRW) or express an endogenous xenotropic gp70 (C57BL/6). These two gp70 alleles are detectable by type-specific mAbs.",['CA-40575/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (glycoprotein gp70, murine serum)']",,PMC2189291,"['Rocky Mountain Laboratories, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Hamilton, Montana 59840.']",,,,

To this end, a detailed study of the influence exerted by: (a) the value of R; (b) the number of effector and target cells (N, T); and (c) the source (donor) and enrichment of the effector cell population on the frequency of conjugation between NK effector and K562 target cells has been performed. This has demonstrated that for a given value of R large differences in the values of alpha can be obtained for different donors and/or N values. Hence, the usual practice of reporting the frequency of conjugation at a given value of R cannot be used as a valid criterion for comparison, and this could explain the differences in the alpha values reported in the literature for the same effector-target system. Moreover, the frequency of conjugation depends on the enrichment of the effector cell populations, although it has been shown that in all cases a plot of 1/alpha vs. R for N = constant is always linear with intercept 1/alpha max.alpha max represents the maximum frequency of conjugation for an effector-target system and remains constant for all values of R and N, and is also independent on the donor of the cell source. These characteristics make that the values of alpha max can be used as an easy criterion to determine with accuracy conjugate frequencies in an effector-target system, and could also be applied to characterize the activation or inhibition of effector cell populations by monoclonal antibodies or other agents. This criterion was applied to characterize the enrichment of NK cell populations and so, a value of alpha max = 58 +/- 3% has been obtained when highly purified (greater than or equal to 99%) NK effector cells obtained by panning with the monoclonal antibodies Leu-2, Leu-3 and Leu-4 are used.

The recent discovery of nuclear retinoic acid receptors provides a basis for understanding how retinoic acid acts at the genetic level. We have now found that retinoic acid is incorporated into HL60 cells in a form that is not removed by extraction with CHCl3:CH3OH. About 90% of this labeled retinoic acid is trichloroacetic acid-soluble after digestion with proteinase K or after hydrolysis with either NH2OH or CH3OH:KOH under mild conditions. Methyl retinoate is the major product of hydrolysis with CH3OH:KOH. These results are consistent with retinoylation of protein with the formation of an ester, probably thioester, bond. The extent of the retinoylation of HL60 protein is dependent on both time and retinoic acid concentration. A major fraction of the retinoylation is of protein that has a molecular mass of 55 kDa after reduction with dithiothreitol. On two-dimensional gels, the retinoylated protein has a pI of about 4.9 and a molecular mass of 55-60 kDa. These characteristics and its localization in the cell nucleus are consistent with retinoylation of the HL60 nuclear retinoic acid receptor or a closely related protein.",,"['0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",,,"['Laboratory of Biological Chemistry, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.']",,,,

In an effort to elucidate the relationship between activity and chemical structure of dipyridamole, the ability to enhance the growth inhibitory effect of ADR, in multidrug-resistant (MDR) P388 murine leukemia cells, was determined for 43 derivatives and related compounds. Since both substituted pyrimidopyrimidines and pteridines enhanced the growth-inhibitory effect of ADR in drug resistant cells, the core skeleton may not be directly involved and rather serve as a carrier for the substituents connected with this activity. The exact positions of the active substituents on the core skeleton did not seem to be critical for exertion of the activity. Activity was dependent on the presence of 3 tertiary amine groups. However, not all tertiary amines showed the same potency which might be related to the degree of basicity and/or the spatial structure of these groups. The most active derivatives carried piperidine and pyrrolidine groups while derivatives with thiomorpholine, 3-hydroxypiperidine or dimethylamine groups had low activity.

The cell lines (K-562 and Raji) were incubated for 1 (4-HC) or 4 h (CP), washed, and assayed for inhibition of colony formation in semisolid media. In both cell lines, CP (4h) was more potent than 4-HC (1 h). Combinations of the drugs in various molar ratios were studied after the cells were sequentially incubated with 4-HC and CP. The effects of the drugs were analyzed using the multiple drug-effect analysis of Chou and Talalay. Analysis of data on in vitro inhibition of colony formation suggested that all combinations studied were synergistic in both cell lines, with the greatest synergism being found in the Raji cell line. In addition, for K-562 cells we could detect at least a 4.6 log reduction in cloning with the CP:4-HC combination (1:10 molar ratio).

Treatment of rats bearing the L5222-S and of mice transplanted with the MOPC-315 plasmocytoma with low doses of mafosfamide or cyclophosphamide resulted in a high percentage of surviving animals, which were resistant to a subsequent tumor challenge. Viable leukemic cells were needed to establish antitumor immunity, since it was not possible to induce resistance by injection of mitomycin-C-treated, non-viable L5222 cells. The adoptive transfer of spleen cells from animals immune against the L5222-S and the MOPC-315 resulted in resistance of the syngeneic recipients against a rechallenge with tumor cells, provided that the animals were treated with an immunosuppressive dose (100 mg/kg) of cyclophosphamide prior to the spleen cell implantation.

We have recently reported that the plasma membrane prepared from an adriamycin (ADM)-resistant variant (K562/ADM) of human myelogenous leukemia K562 cells showed ATP/Mg2+-dependent high affinity binding of vincristine (VCR), which is closely related to the drug transport mechanism in this cell line. To clarify how calcium channel blockers inhibit the transport of antitumor agents from the resistant cells, we analyzed the effect of calcium channel blockers and Ca2+ ion on the VCR binding to K562/ADM plasma membrane. The ATP-dependent VCR binding was inhibited by calcium channel blockers (verapamil, nicardipine, and diltiazem), which are known to inhibit drug efflux from the resistant cells. Addition of [ethylenebis(oxyethylenenitrilo)]tetraacetic acid or high concentration of Ca2+ decreased the amount of VCR binding to some extent; however, a substantial amount of VCR still could bind to K562/ADM plasma membrane. The inhibitory effect of verapamil on the VCR binding was observed regardless of the Ca2+ concentration. Klotz plot analysis revealed that the inhibition of the VCR binding to K562/ADM plasma membrane by verapamil was competitive. Dissociation constant (Kd) of VCR and apparent inhibitory constant (Kiapp) of verapamil were calculated to be 0.1 +/- 0.1 microM (SD) and 1 +/- 1 microM, respectively. These results indicate that Ca2+ ion is not required for the VCR binding and that verapamil competitively inhibits the VCR binding without concerning Ca2+ ion. Antitumor agents (vinblastine, actinomycin D, ADM, and colchicine) and other agents known to reverse multidrug resistance (nicardipine, diltiazem, cyclosporin A, quinidine, and trifluoperazine) also inhibited the VCR binding competitively.",,"['5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",,,"['Cancer Chemotherapy Center, Japanese Foundation for Cancer Research, Tokyo.']",,,,

Of 162 compounds evaluated, significant alterations in the GTPase reaction were observed with 26 agents. Sixteen of these had substantial inhibitory effects on tubulin polymerization (true positives), while ten did not (false positives). There were no false negatives (i.e., no agent inactive in the GTPase assay inhibited tubulin polymerization).

The 51 patients with C-ALL who presented for comparison were distributed more evenly over the study period. Pre-B children had more basophilic blast cells with less periodic acid-Schiff positivity.

In this study the density of nucleoside transporters in freshly-isolated blast cells from patients with leukaemias and lymphomas was quantitated by equilibrium binding of 3H-nitrobenzylmercaptopurine riboside (NBMPR). In acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) the density of NBMPR binding sites on blast cells ranged from 3800 to 24,200 sites/cell and this value correlated with the 3H-thymidine labelling index (1-20%) which was used to measure proliferative rate (r = 0.80, P less than 0.001). Cells from patients with Burkitt's lymphoma, other B-cell lymphomas, T-lymphoblastic lymphoma and large cell lymphoma gave a 20-fold range of NBMPR site densities (from 3700 to 75,300 sites/cell) and site numbers correlated closely with the labelling index (r = 0.87, P less than 0.001). Non-proliferating cells from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia expressed the lowest density of NBMPR binding sites (850-2900 sites/cell). Comparison of bone marrow and peripheral blood blasts confirmed the positive correlation between NBMPR binding sites and labelling index for four individual patients. In contrast, the density of NBMPR binding sites on lymphoblasts from non-T acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) was low (2300-7400 sites/cell) and showed little dependence on proliferation over a wide range of labelling indices (1-20%). No correlation was observed between NBMPR site density and cell size measured by the intracellular water space.

Both compounds inhibited the binding to DNA of the ubiquitous octamer binding factor OTF 1 and of the erythroid specific GATAAG protein (NFE 1). This was shown using the electrophoretic mobility shift assay on a DNA fragment of human gamma-globin gene promoter (-156 to -201), on the same fragment with a point mutation (T to C mutation) known to have an increased affinity of binding for NFE 1, on a DNA fragment of human histone H2B promoter and on a DNA fragment of mouse alpha 1 globin promoter. The ability of distamycin or of FCE 24517 to inhibit the binding was specific for AT-rich sequences since neither drug inhibited the binding of nuclear protein factors to the sequence CCACACCC of the human beta globin gene. Binding to DNA was investigated by evaluating the drugs' ability to protect selected sequences from DNase I digestion (DNase footprinting). Distamycins binding was highly preferential for DNA sequences containing stretches of AT. These studies indicate that chemicals which have a high degree of DNA sequence-specific binding can selectively inhibit the binding of regulatory proteins to DNA.

Interestingly, translocations involving these two regions have been described in various hematopoietic malignancies: the t(6;9)(p23;q34) in acute nonlymphocytic leukemias and the 3q26-q28 translocations in a large variety of leukemias.",,['0 (Genetic Markers)'],,,"['Clinique et Unite de Recherches de Genetique Medicale (INSERM U.12), Hopital des Enfants-Malades, Paris, France.']",,,,

We have identified five cases of retrovirus-associated ATLL among Hawaii-born first generation offspring (nisei) of migrant Japanese. Four patients were offspring of migrant Japanese (issei) who emigrated to Hawaii from Okinawa, an HTLV-I endemic area. The fifth patient was born of parents who emigrated to Hawaii from Fukushima and Miyagi prefectures, HTLV-I nonendemic areas. Epidemiologic implications and family studies with regard to HTLV-I antibody testing of the index cases are discussed. The high rate of HTLV-I antibody seropositivity among family members and relatives indicates that the risk of acquiring HTLV-I infection and of developing ATLL persists long after migration. Documentation of ATLL among offspring of Japanese immigrants to Hawaii is an important observation because it confirms the potential for long latency between putative exposure to virus and the development of overt disease. Changing marriage patterns among the Hawaii-Japanese may weaken the risk of vertical virus transmission to the descendents of migrants from southern Japan, while increasing the risk to children born of mixed marriages. In addition, blood products derived from high-risk donors will constitute a continuing hazard if they are not subject to screening.",,['0 (HTLV-I Antibodies)'],,,"['Department of Pathology, Kuakini Medical Center, Honolulu, Hawaii 96817.']",,,,

JURKAT T cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells were incubated with 2,7-dichlorofluorescin diacetate. This substance was hydrolysed in the cells, leading to a non-fluorescent product which was oxidized into highly fluorescent 2,7-dichlorofluorescein by oxygen reactive species. These latter products were analysed by flow cytometry in phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-stimulated ethanol (ETH)-treated mononuclear cells. The level of fluorescence intensity (FI) was found higher in stimulated cells than in non-stimulated cells. ETH displayed two different effects on the cells: either a decrease of FI associated with a decrease of the number of fluorescent cells (FC) or an increase in FI. Both effects were dose-dependent. ETH is an effective scavenger of .OH radicals, but it is also oxidized by the microsomal ETH oxidizing system with production of oxygen reactive species, which probably explains the opposite effects of ETH. In the presence of desferal, an iron-chelating agent, and nordihydroguaiaretic acid, an inhibitor of the lipooxygenase pathway, the cells showed a decrease of FI and FC.

To identify the mechanisms of the thrombocytopenia, we studied platelet and fibrinogen kinetics and antiplatelet antibodies in 20 patients between 60 and 649 days (median 90) after transplantation. Seventeen patients had isolated thrombocytopenia (less than 100 X 10(9) platelets/L): the marrow cellularity was normal in five patients and slightly reduced in 12, and there was no discrepancy between thrombopoiesis and myeloerythropoiesis. Three patients had pancytopenia following marrow graft rejection (two) and relapse of leukemia (one). Only three patients had evidence of increased platelet production, indicating that in most cases there is a poor marrow response to thrombocytopenia early after marrow grafting. There was no correlation between platelet count and splenic pooling, suggesting that hypersplenism was an unlikely mechanism of the thrombocytopenia. Although there was a direct relationship between platelet count and platelet survival, the reduction in platelet survival was greater than what could be explained by the fixed platelet removal found in thrombocytopenic patients; this suggests increased platelet destruction. Seven patients had intercurrent infections that reduced both platelet and fibrinogen survivals. In addition, platelet antibodies bound to autologous or marrow donor platelets were present in five of the 12 patients studied. Patients with antiplatelet antibodies had lower platelet counts (30 +/- 10 X 10(9)/L v. 49.1 +/- 28.7 X 10(9)/L, P less than 0.05) and platelet survivals (1.32 +/- 0.92 days v. 3.58 +/- 2.02 days, P less than 0.05) than patients without antiplatelet antibodies. Furthermore, platelet-bound autoantibodies were present in five of six patients with grade II-IV acute or chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), but were not present in six patients free of GVHD (P less than 0.01). We conclude that persistent thrombocytopenia after marrow transplantation is most often secondary to increased platelet destruction mediated by multiple mechanisms and that platelet autoantibodies are found in patients with acute or chronic GVHD.","['33775/PHS HHS/United States', 'CA 15704/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 18221/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['9001-32-5 (Fibrinogen)'],,,"['Puget Sound Blood Center, Seattle, WA 98104.']",,['Blood. 1989 Dec;74(8):2771.

A possible toxic effect of these substances on the central nervous system was confounded with alcoholism which was associated with disability from neuropsychiatric disease in 12 of 20 painters and in only one of 10 electricians. Mortality and incidence of cancer were assessed among both cohorts and compared with the expected figures calculated from Geneva rates. Among painters there was a significant increase in overall mortality (O = 254, E = 218.5), in mortality from all cancers (O = 96, E = 75.4), and in incidence from all cancers (O = 159, E = 132.0). For the specific cancer sites, there was a significant excess risk for lung cancer (mortality: O = 40, E = 23.0), which was possibly related to occupational exposure to asbestos and to zinc chromate, although cigarette smoking was not controlled. The significant excesses of biliary tract cancer and of bladder cancer were in accordance with previous observations among painters from other countries. There was also a significant increase in incidence from testicular cancer (O=5, E=1.6), which has not been reported before. For causes of death other than cancer the excesses for alcoholism (O=5, E=0.8). for liver cirrhosis (O=14, E=8.8), for motor vehicle accidents (O=12, E=5.9), and for cerebrovascular disease when allowing for ten years of latency (O=8, E=4.0), were consistent with a probable increased risk of alcohol abuse. Among electricians overall mortality was similar to that expected (O=137, E=139.0). No significant excess risk was found for all cancers or for any specific cancer site. Because of the small number of expected deaths the statistical power was low for the assessment of a possible risk for leukaemia or for brain tumour.",,,,PMC1009717,"['Geneva Medical Inspectorate of Factories, Switzerland.']",,,,

In addition, after intake of high doses of retinol, significant amounts are also found in low-density lipoprotein (LDL). As both chylomicron remnants and LDL may be taken up by cells via the LDL receptor, and retinoids inhibit proliferation of some leukaemic cells, we have studied the uptake of retinol in leukaemic cells via the LDL-receptor pathway. HL-60 cells contain saturable binding sites for LDL. The binding of LDL to its receptor has a dissociation constant of about 3.2 x 10(-9) M, and the number of receptors per cell was calculated to be about 2700. Uptake of 125I-LDL by HL-60 cells was increased 2-fold by preincubating the cells with mevinolin. The presence of specific receptors for LDL on HL-60 cells was further confirmed by the finding that exogenous LDL cholesterol was able to up-regulate the ACAT (acyl-CoA: cholesterol acyltransferase) activity of HL-60 cells. We then tested the uptake of retinyl ester in leukaemic cells via the LDL-receptor pathway. HL-60 cells were incubated with LDL or chylomicron remnants labelled with [3H]retinyl palmitate. Uptake of retinyl ester associated with both LDL and chylomicron remnants was observed. Furthermore, the presence of excess LDL decreased the uptake by 75-100%, supporting the hypothesis that the uptake of retinyl ester occurred via the LDL receptor in HL-60 cells.",,"['0 (Diterpenes)', '0 (Lipoproteins)', '0 (Lipoproteins, LDL)', '0 (Retinoids)', '0 (Retinol-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Retinyl Esters)', '0 (retinyl ester lipoprotein complex)', '11103-57-4 (Vitamin A)', '1D1K0N0VVC (retinol palmitate)', '9LHU78OQFD (Lovastatin)', 'EC 2.3.1.26 (Sterol O-Acyltransferase)']",,PMC1135561,"['Institute for Nutrition Research, School of Medicine, University of Oslo, Norway.']",,,,

The levels of mRNA coding for LDL-R and HMG-CoA reductase increased soon after induction, reached a maximum (12- and 7-fold increase, respectively) in 2-3 hr, and then rapidly returned to the low constitutive levels observed before induction. The stability of LDL-R mRNA did not change significantly during differentiation, whereas that of HMG-CoA reductase mRNA decreased by about 5-fold 6 hr after the addition of PMA. Transcriptional induction of both LDL-R and HMG-CoA reductase genes (5.6- and 2-fold, respectively) was also observed when undifferentiated cells were treated with cycloheximide (CHX), resulting in a transient increase in steady-state mRNA (7- and 3-fold, respectively). These results suggest that expression of the two genes is maintained at low constitutive levels in uninduced THP-1 cells by a protein with a short half-life. Superinduction of both genes occurred when PMA and CHX were added simultaneously. The induction of LDL-R and HMG-CoA reductase mRNAs during early macrophage differentiation is mediated by protein kinase C. It is hypothesized that protein kinase C acts directly or indirectly to inactivate the labile negative regulatory protein. Induction of LDL-R mRNA was also observed when the human hepatocarcinoma cell line Hep G2 was treated with PMA and CHX, suggesting that this mechanism of regulation may exist in several cell types.","['AM 02456/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States', 'GM 15253/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'HL 30086/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, LDL)', 'EC 1.1.1.- (Hydroxymethylglutaryl CoA Reductases)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,PMC286640,"['Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle 98195.']",,,,

Other cultures were infected with Friend spleen focus-forming virus polycythemia-inducing strain (SFFVp), Moloney MuLV, or amphotropic MuLV, or were uninfected controls. Harvested nonadherent cells were tested weekly for multilineage, granulocyte-erythroid-megakaryocyte macrophage (CFU-GEMM) colony formation in vitro in recombinant murine IL-3 and erythropoietin, and individual colonies were removed, split 1:2, with half of each replated for in vitro self-renewal and the other half examined morphologically for number of hematopoietic cellular lineages, or tested for release of MuLV and src virus. Cultures infected with src-Ampho, src-Mo, or SFFVp demonstrated a significant increase in cumulative nonadherent cell and CFU-GEMM production. There was prolonged self-renewal over seven serial transfers of individual CFU-GEMM from src virus-infected cultures over seven serial transfers, and five of 61 individual colonies from the second or third generations contained detectable v-src gene sequences, but none released detectable src virus. Self-renewal of CFU-GEMM was similar to that with permanent IL-3-dependent cell line B6SUtA. In contrast, MuLV-infected or control uninfected cultures produced fewer cells, and self-renewal of CFU-GEMM did not exceed three generations. IL-3-dependent clonal hematopoietic progenitor cell lines, derived from each culture group, formed no detectable tumors in vivo; however, each released the original helper and/or transforming virus. Adherent cell lines, derived from src-Ampho-infected cultures released src virus and formed fibro-sarcomas in vivo. The data support the conclusion that src-recombinant virus expression in long-term marrow cultures increases the self-renewal capacity of multilineage hematopoietic stem cells.","['CA39851/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA40818/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01HD19767/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States']",,,,"['Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester 01655.']",,,,

In general, the synthetic route involved the coupling of diethyl N-[4-(prop-2-ynylamino)benzoyl]-L-glutamate (5a) with 6-(bromomethyl)-2-chloro-3,4-dihydro-4-oxoquinazoline in N,N-dimethylformamide with calcium carbonate as the base, displacement of the C2-chloro substituent with nitrogen and sulfur nucleophiles, and deprotection using mild alkali. The C2-ether analogues were most conveniently prepared by coupling 5a with 6-(bromomethyl)-2,4-diakoxy(or diphenoxy)quinazolines. In this series the final deprotection step with aqueous alkali gave simultaneous selective hydrolysis of the C4-alkoxy or C4-phenoxy substituent. The compounds were tested as inhibitors of partially purified L1210 thymidylate synthase (TS). As a measure of cytotoxicity, they were examined for their inhibition of the growth of L1210 cells in culture. The C2-methoxy analogue 11a was equivalent to the previously described tight binding TS inhibitor N10-propargyl-5,8-dideazafolic acid (CB3717, ICI 155387, 1a) against the TS enzyme and exhibited enhanced potency in culture. The C2-methoxy substituent also gave a 110-fold enhancement in aqueous solubility relative to the C2-amine. These results suggest that 11a will be an interesting compound for further study as a potential antitumor agent in vivo. A further series of 2-methoxyquinazoline antifolates with modified alkyl substituents at N10 is also described. None of these analogues equalled the activity of 11a.

Incubation of the highly purified rat brain protein kinase C isozymes with trypsin (kinase/trypsin (w/w) = 100) under identical conditions results in a preferential degradation of types I and II enzymes, whereas the type III enzyme was relatively resistant to tryptic proteolysis. Degradation of the type III enzyme by trypsin could be facilitated with the addition of Ca2+, phosphatidylserine, and dioleoylglycerol; none of these components alone was effective. Limited proteolysis of the three protein kinase C isozymes generated distinctive fragments for each isozyme, indicating that each isozyme has different trypsin-sensitive sites. Tryptic digestion of the type III protein kinase C was used as a model to determine the effects of various modulators on protein kinase C degradation. While Ca2+ and phosphatidylserine together were sufficient to convert the type III protein kinase C from a trypsin-insensitive to a -sensitive form, addition of dioleoylglycerol greatly reduced the Ca2+ requirement for such a conversion. Among the various phospholipids tested, in the presence of either dioleoylglycerol or phorbol ester, phosphatidylserine, cardiolipin, and phosphatidic acid were the most effective, and phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine were the least effective in supporting the digestion of type III protein kinase. Other acidic phospholipids, such as lysophosphatidylserine and phosphatidylinositol, were also effective in supporting the degradation in the presence of phorbol ester but not in the presence of dioleoylglycerol. The relevance of these proteolytic reactions to physiological responses was assessed with phorbol ester on rat basophilic leukemia RBL-2H3 cells, which contained both types II and III protein kinase C. Immunoblot analysis with the isozyme-specific antibodies revealed that phorbol ester induced a faster degradation of type II than that of type III isozyme in these cells. The results demonstrate that the various protein kinase C isozymes have different susceptibilities to proteolysis in vitro, when tested with trypsin, as well as to endogenous proteases in intact cells.",,"['0 (Diglycerides)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 3.4.21.4 (Trypsin)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,,"['Endocrinology and Reproduction Research Branch, National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.']",,,,

Although a long latent period is suggested from migrant studies, little prospective information on the risk of developing ATL among persons with HTLV-I infection is available. We present here a model for ATL risk based upon age- and sex-specific HTLV-I seroprevalence data from a cross-sectional survey of 13,000 Jamaicans and ATL incidence data from a 2 1/2-year case-control study. By examining the age-specific incidence of ATL relative to both adult and childhood-acquired seropositivity versus childhood-acquired seropositivity alone, we provide evidence in support of the hypothesis that childhood infection with HTLV-I is important to the development of ATL. Using this model, the cumulative lifetime risk of ATL for those infected before age 20 is estimated to be 4.0% for males and 4.2% for females. Under this hypothesis, HTLV-I-associated diseases with shorter latent periods, such as tropical spastic paraparesis, should have a higher incidence in adult females than in adult males.",,,,,"['Viral Epidemiology Section, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD 20892.']",,,,

Low TAA sublines were selected from a cultured human leukemia cell line by growing out cells remaining after treatment with anti-TAA and C, or after immunomagnetic (IM) purging. IM-selected sublines showed lower TAA expression than did C-selected sublines, and sublines resulting from multiple selections expressed less TAA than those that had only been through one selection.

Less selected sublines were resistant to C, but not to IM. In both techniques, addition of MoAbs against a second TAA restored the efficiency of purging to that observed with the parental line.

Like phorbol esters, bryostatin 1 is capable of binding to and activating protein kinase C, but these two compounds differ in the ability of bryostatin 1 to act as a tumor promoter. We have investigated whether bryostatin 1 can modulate the differentiated phenotype of fresh samples of human myeloid leukemia. We find that six of seven samples responded to bryostatin treatment with changes associated with a more differentiated phenotype including increases in macrophage-like morphology and an increase in adherence and OKM1 and alpha-naphthyl acetate esterase activity positivity. The percentage of cells within each sample evidencing these changes varied markedly among the seven patients' cells examined. Because of the effects of bryostatin on fresh samples we examined the ability of bryostatin to differentiate four HL-60 cell sublines obtained from different laboratories. We found that two of the cell lines did not respond either with an inhibition of growth or morphological change, while one was inhibited, and one showed both growth inhibition and some induction of macrophage-like morphology when treated with bryostatin. To test whether other differentiating agents would enhance the effects of bryostatin 1, we added tumor necrosis factor alpha and bryostatin to these four cell lines. The addition of both agents effected an additive inhibition of growth. These data suggest that bryostatin 1 alone or in combination with other biological response modifiers may have a role in the treatment of human leukemia.","['CA 16048-07/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 42533/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 45672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Bryostatins)', '0 (Lactones)', '0 (Macrolides)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '37O2X55Y9E (bryostatin 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)']",,,"['Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of Alabama, Birmingham.']",,,,

In the normal human lymphocytes, the activities of dihydrothymine dehydrogenase, thymidine phosphorylase, thymidine kinase, and thymidylate synthase were 6.88, 796, 0.30, and 0.29 nmol/h/mg protein, respectively. In leukemia-lymphoma cell lines, the activities of synthetic enzymes, thymidine kinase, and thymidylate synthase, increased two- to 79-fold and 22- to 407-fold of the normal lymphocyte values. In contrast, the activities of the catabolic enzymes, dihydrothymine dehydrogenase and thymidine phosphorylase, decreased to 5-42% and 3-38% of the values of normal lymphocytes. As a result, the ratio of activities of thymidine kinase/dihydrothymine dehydrogenase was elevated by 7- to 1170-fold, respectively. Thus, reciprocal behavior in the activities of the opposing enzymes in thymidine metabolism was observed in human leukemia-lymphoma cells. Polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies against dihydrothymine dehydrogenase were prepared and studies on immunotitration of this enzyme with these antibodies showed that the enzyme protein amount in Jurkat leukemic cells was 36% of that of normal lymphocytes. This was in good agreement with the decrease in the activity of the enzyme to 32%, indicating that the decrease in activity in the leukemic cells was due to the decline in the amount of enzyme protein. The metabolic imbalances in thymidine utilization appear to be characteristic of human leukemia-lymphoma cells.

Patients who achieved a complete remission received a repeat course of high-dose cytosine arabinoside and daunorubicin within 4 weeks of attaining remission. Seven patients had an antecedant history of a myelodysplastic syndrome. Infection was the major complication experienced by this elderly patient group, and included ten episodes of bacteremia or fungemia (four of which were fatal) and five cases of pneumonia (one fatality). Nine of the 21 patients (three of 13 at the first dose level and six of eight at the second dose level) achieved a complete remission. Median remission duration was 9 months (range, 4-19+ months). Although high-dose cytosine arabinoside plus daunorubicin was an effective antileukemic therapy, it is too toxic to recommend for most elderly leukemic patients.","['CA03227/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA19657/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA37577/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']","['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",,,"['Ireland Cancer Center of Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, Cleveland, Ohio.']",,,,

Tiazofurin induced hemoglobin production in MEL cells in a concentration-dependent manner, as measured by an increase in benzidine staining. Northern blot analysis of MEL cells treated with 7 mumol/L tiazofurin demonstrated accumulation of both alpha- and beta-globin RNA transcripts. This induction of differentiation was blocked by the presence of exogenous guanosine (100 mumol/L). In contrast to the down-regulation of c-myc and c-myb RNA in MEL cells induced by dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) or hexamethylene bisacetamide (HMBA), there was no detectable change in levels of these transcripts after tiazofurin treatment.

There was no tendency to higher values with longer times after treatment, and the low incidence was not predictive of relapse. Long-term cultures from ALL bone marrows and from controls achieved similar levels of production of mature cells through the whole period of culture (6 weeks). However, cultures from patients' bone marrow had on average about 5 times lower numbers of GM-CFC, indicating that the level of mature cell production was achieved by a higher level of post-GM-CFC amplification than needed in the controls.

We studied in vitro phenotypic modulation of three typical cases after induction by 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol 13 acetate. The initial phenotype was different in each case, but all of them exhibited changes in morphologic shape, cytochemistry, and immunophenotype; common features appeared after induction by 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol 13 acetate, including esterase activity, expression of CD-9, CD-15, and CD-18 surface antigens, and monocyte/macrophage morphology. In all cases a B-associated surface antigen, CD-19, persisted. During clinical evolution, some previously reported cases have shown a karyotypic and phenotypic transformation. In one of our cases this phenomenon correlated with in vitro phenotypic modulation of initial blast population. Furthermore, clinical relapses and in vitro modulation always seem to evolve toward a more ""mature"" phenotype. Those results support the ""promiscuous lineage"" hypothesis, and point out the usefulness of in vitro studies to express the myeloid potential of this category of acute leukemia, which can be regarded as a model of early hematopoietic differentiation.",,['NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)'],,,"['Hematology Laboratory, Centre Hospitalier Regional et Universitaire de Brest, France.']",,,,

Seventeen (29%) of these patients had a positive direct antiglobulin test (DAT) with the following characteristics: the test was of the IgG and/or C3d type in all but two cases, which reacted with polyvalent antiglobulin sera only; the reaction was very weak throughout; very high concentrations of monospecific sera were needed to elicit positive reactions; free antibodies were never detected in the patients' serum; the eluates of the patients' red cells were non-reactive against a very large panel of test erythrocytes.

By studying cDNA clones obtained from the cell line KBM-5, we identified two new bcr-abl transcripts. These are formed by alternative splicing of at least two exons to the known bcr exon 2. One novel transcript can encode a protein kinase of approximately 190 kd, while the other can direct the synthesis of a larger protein whose amino terminus remains to be defined. The alternative exons can be spliced also to the two normal bcr transcripts, reflecting the activation of a cryptic promoter. These messages were present at low abundance in two cases of blastic crisis but were not detected in the chronic phase. It is conceivable that the proteins encoded by the new bcr-abl mRNAs are involved in the transformation to the acute phase in some cases of chronic myelogenous leukemia.",,"['0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",,,"['Department of Clinical Immunology, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030.']",,,,
