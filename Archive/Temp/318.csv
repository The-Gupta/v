Complete arresting of the inflammatory process has been recorded in 94.0% of patients with hemoblastosis. The results of the investigation permit recommending MVF in the treatment of infectious (postinjection and postbemorrhagic) infiltrates, chronic bronchitis and acute pneumonia that complicate the course of hemoblastosis. This method of treatment not only diminishes the terms of infectious process elimination, but also increases the effectiveness of their control.","['Abdulkadyrov, K M', 'Semenov, A I', ""Bessmel'tsev, S S""]","['Abdulkadyrov KM', 'Semenov AI', ""Bessmel'tsev SS""]",,['rus'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Russia (Federation),Gematol Transfuziol,Gematologiia i transfuziologiia,8301796,IM,"['Bacterial Infections/etiology/*radiotherapy', 'Bronchitis/etiology/*radiotherapy', '*Electromagnetic Phenomena', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*complications', 'Multiple Myeloma/*complications', 'Opportunistic Infections/etiology/*radiotherapy', 'Pneumonia/etiology/*radiotherapy', 'Radio Waves', 'Radiotherapy Dosage']",1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Gematol Transfuziol. 1991 Jan;36(1):28-31.,,,,Primenenie elektromagnitnykh izluchenii sverkhvysokoi chastoty dlia lecheniia infektsionnykh oslozhnenii u bol'nykh gemoblastozami.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several immunological parameters of the disease have been analyzed and genetic studies have mapped a gene (or genes) of resistance in the H-2 complex and shown that the genetic background of the mouse can significantly modify some features of the disease. The etiologic agent of MAIDS is a defective murine leukemia virus that seems able to induce disease in the absence of virus replication. This defective virus induces proliferation of its target cells and the cell expansion was found to be oligoclonal, thus suggesting that the immunodeficiency observed in these mice is a paraneoplastic syndrome. The excellent response of MAIDS mice to antineoplastic agents is consistent with this notion. This animal model has already been useful in stimulating the emergence of novel questions and the formulation of new hypotheses about human AIDS, namely about the role of defective HIV, the role of HIV replication in the progression of the disease, and the importance to identify the target cells of HIV in vivo. Although MAIDS and AIDS are not identical and are induced by retroviruses of different classes, the availability of such a model in an easily accessible small animal species, whose genetics is very sophisticated, may be instrumental in understanding the pathogenesis of AIDS if some of the cellular and molecular affected pathways are common in both diseases.","['Jolicoeur, P']",['Jolicoeur P'],"['Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Clinical Research Institute of Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,FASEB J,FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology,8804484,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Concanavalin A/pharmacology', 'Cyclophosphamide/therapeutic use', 'Cytokines/biosynthesis', '*Disease Models, Animal', 'Mice', 'Murine Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/drug therapy/*etiology/genetics', 'Retroviridae/genetics/pathogenicity', 'Virus Replication', 'Zidovudine/therapeutic use']",1991/07/01 00:00,1991/07/01 00:01,['1991/07/01 00:00'],"['1991/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1096/fasebj.5.10.2065888 [doi]'],ppublish,FASEB J. 1991 Jul;5(10):2398-405. doi: 10.1096/fasebj.5.10.2065888.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cytokines)', '11028-71-0 (Concanavalin A)', '4B9XT59T7S (Zidovudine)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)']",73,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Severity of symptoms was not found to be related to beta-EP level. A group of early-treated adolescents with phenylketonuria had beta-EP levels similar to the Rett syndrome patients, but no symptoms resembling theirs.

The percentages of natural killer cells (Leu-7-positive and CD16-positive) were small and also similar to percentages in effusions of other etiologies.

The high salt effect predominated in the binding rather than the lytic phase of the extract reaction similar to the activity of extract inhibitory supernates preferentially produced from L5178Y-F9 cells. Exposure of the L5178Y-F9 to 0.25 M NaCl was associated with an increased production of inhibitory supernate and an increased sensitivity of the cell as an extract target. Pretreatment of inhibitor-containing supernatant or inhibitor-producing L5178Y-F9 cells with pronase or chondroitinase AC reduced the inhibitory activity of the resultant supernates, and L5178Y-F9 supernates treated with anti-chondroitin sulphate AC antibodies exhibited reduced inhibitory activity. These observations and the previously reported molecular weight heterogeneity and protease sensitivity of the inhibitor argue that chondroitin sulphate AC-containing proteoglycans released from the tumor cell surface may inhibit cytolysin activity, contributing to the preferential resistance of the L5178Y-F9 to rat NK granule extract cytolysis.","['Chow, D A']",['Chow DA'],"['Immunology Department, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Cell Immunol,Cellular immunology,1246405,IM,"['Animals', 'Chondroitin Sulfate Proteoglycans/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Chondroitinases and Chondroitin Lyases/pharmacology', 'Cytoplasmic Granules/*physiology', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Cytotoxins/*toxicity', 'Endopeptidases/pharmacology', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Lymphoma/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Sodium Chloride/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0008-8749(91)90006-W [pii]', '10.1016/0008-8749(91)90006-w [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Immunol. 1991 Jan;132(1):56-69. doi: 10.1016/0008-8749(91)90006-w.,"['0 (Chondroitin Sulfate Proteoglycans)', '0 (Cytotoxins)', '451W47IQ8X (Sodium Chloride)', 'EC 3.4.- (Endopeptidases)', 'EC 4.2.2.- (Chondroitinases and Chondroitin Lyases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In a limited investigation on the genes for tumor necrosis factors-alpha and -beta, a surprising interindividual concordance in the patterns of DNA methylation at the nucleotide level has been demonstrated earlier by using the genomic sequencing method on DNA from individuals of very different ethnic origins. Patterns of DNA methylation could perhaps serve as indicators for genetic activities. These activities would not have to be restricted to gene transcription but could relate to other genetic activities in the cell. DNA methylation patterns are known to be cell type-specific. We have now initiated a study of these DNA patterns in human lymphocytes and in human cell lines of different malignant origins. Several of the proto-oncogenes, parts of the genes for tumor necrosis factor-alpha and -beta, the insulin receptor and lamin C have been used as hybridization probes. We have relied to some extent on the documented observation that the methylation patterns at 5'-CCGG-3' (HpaII/MspI) sequences yield a reflection of patterns at all 5'-CG-3' sequences. Three main types of patterns have been observed. Some of the probed segments are completely unmethylated; others are fully methylated, most of the areas are partly methylated exhibiting complex patterns at the 5'-CCGG-3' sites. In different tumor cell lines, different DNA methylation patterns are apparent for the same DNA probes. Comparisons of the methylation patterns in a given DNA segment between DNA from primary normal human lymphocytes and DNA from different tumor cell lines reveal changes in these patterns in several instances.","['Achten, S', 'Behn-Krappa, A', 'Jucker, M', 'Sprengel, J', 'Holker, I', 'Schmitz, B', 'Tesch, H', 'Diehl, V', 'Doerfler, W']","['Achten S', 'Behn-Krappa A', 'Jucker M', 'Sprengel J', 'Holker I', 'Schmitz B', 'Tesch H', 'Diehl V', 'Doerfler W']","['Institute of Genetics, University of Cologne, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Base Sequence', 'DNA/*metabolism', 'Genes, myc', 'Genes, ras', '*Genome, Human', 'Hodgkin Disease/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Lymphotoxin-alpha/genetics', 'Methylation', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1991/07/15 00:00,1991/07/15 00:01,['1991/07/15 00:00'],"['1991/07/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/07/15 00:01 [medline]', '1991/07/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1991 Jul 15;51(14):3702-9.,"['0 (Lymphotoxin-alpha)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

If only a portion of chromosome 5 is missing, the loss is usually accomplished by interstitial deletion of various bands, most frequently q12-14 to q31-33 [3]. Occasionally monosomy for 5q is the result of a translocation between chromosome 5 and another chromosome, with the loss of the derivative chromosome that contains 5q.

We report here one case of therapy related MDS, one case of MDS which may be therapy related, and two cases of MDS with another ""variant"" 5q - abnormality, namely a derivative chromosome 3 composed of most of the short arm of chromosome 5 and the long arm of chromosome 3: [der(3)t(3;5)(?p11;?p11)].","['Lindgren, V', 'Gibson, L', 'Yang-Feng, T L']","['Lindgren V', 'Gibson L', 'Yang-Feng TL']","['Department of Human Genetics, Yale University, New Haven, CT 06510.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,IM,"['Aged', 'Chromosome Banding', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 3', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 5', 'Humans', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic']",1991/07/01 00:00,1991/07/01 00:01,['1991/07/01 00:00'],"['1991/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0165-4608(91)90041-R [pii]', '10.1016/0165-4608(91)90041-r [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 1991 Jul 1;54(1):129-31. doi: 10.1016/0165-4608(91)90041-r.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A single hypodiploid cell with both del(5) and der(17) chromosomes that appeared identical to those in the near-triploid line suggests that polyploidization occurred after these structural rearrangements. While EL is not characterized by any well-defined structural abnormality, reported cases are frequently hypodiploid, with occasional cases of polyploidization, as in our patient, EL in adults without previous neoplasia or recognized mutagenic exposure has been shown to have loss or deletion of chromosomes 5 and 7, also characteristic of myelodysplastic syndromes and secondary leukemia. Our patient had a relative lack of chromosomes 5 and 7 in both abnormal clones, as well as a del(5)(q11) in the near-triploid line.

The analysis was based on the person-years method in which the main consideration is the follow-up period after the diagnosis of MM. Of 370 patients with histologically confirmed MM, 27 (7.3%) had a second noncutaneous invasive cancer, diagnosed either simultaneously (within 6 months, five patients) or after the diagnosis of MM (22 patients). The follow-up period for the entire MM group was 1253 person-years, a period during which the expected number of cancer cases in the normal population, according to the Israel Cancer Registry, was 6.6. The observed-expected ratio or the relative risk (RR) was 4.1 (P less than 0.01). After excluding the five patients with simultaneous diagnosis of MM and a second cancer, analysis of the remaining 22 patients in whom MM definitely preceded the second cancer showed an RR of 3.3 (P less than 0.01). For the entire group, there were nine patients with breast cancer, five with head and neck cancer (two with thyroid and three with oral cavity cancer), five with gynecologic cancer (one with uterine and four with ovarian cancer), five myeloproliferative malignancies (one with lymphoma, three with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and one with myeloma), three gastrointestinal carcinomas (two with colon and one with stomach cancer), and two soft tissue sarcomas. When the differential analysis according to gender and age was done, it was found that the RR was higher for women (5.5, P less than 0.01) than for men where the RR was 2.2 (P less than 0.05). Differential analysis for various age groups showed that the trend for second cancer was consistent in all age groups, with a slight increase in the younger ones. None of the variables of MM, such as location of the primary tumor, level of invasion, or stage, were predictive for a second cancer. Furthermore, the RR for a second cancer did not relate significantly with the treatment given to the MM patient. Concerning the type of second cancer, it was found that the RR was especially high for breast cancer--6.6. These data indicate that MM patients may be at higher risk for having a noncutaneous invasive cancer compared with the general population.","['Gutman, M', 'Cnaan, A', 'Inbar, M', 'Shafir, R', 'Chaitchik, S', 'Rozin, R R', 'Klausner, J M']","['Gutman M', 'Cnaan A', 'Inbar M', 'Shafir R', 'Chaitchik S', 'Rozin RR', 'Klausner JM']","['Department of Surgery, Hadassah (Rokach) Hospital, Tel Aviv, Israel.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Breast Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Genital Neoplasms, Female/epidemiology', 'Head and Neck Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Israel', 'Male', 'Melanoma/*epidemiology', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Multiple Primary/*epidemiology', 'Registries', 'Risk Factors', 'Sex Factors', 'Time Factors']",1991/08/01 00:00,1991/08/01 00:01,['1991/08/01 00:00'],"['1991/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19910801)68:3<660::aid-cncr2820680337>3.0.co;2-5 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1991 Aug 1;68(3):660-5. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19910801)68:3<660::aid-cncr2820680337>3.0.co;2-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The elucidation of the molecular basis for this regulation is likely to throw light on new regulatory mechanisms of the host cell. We have investigated the possibility that Rex acts to direct unspliced viral RNA to the nucleolus. To test this possibility, we used in situ hybridization to detect HTLV-I envelope protein (env) transcripts formed in the nucleolus in the presence and absence of the Rex protein. The HTLV-I env sequences are normally removed by splicing from the HTLV-I RNA in the absence of Rex. The experiments presented here show that the accumulation of HTLV-I env sequences in the nucleolus is significantly increased in the presence of Rex. The results raise the possibility that Rex directs unspliced viral mRNA to the nucleolus whence it is exported to the cytoplasm for translation. The association between the nucleolus and retroviral mRNA was lost in purified nucleoli after cellular fractionation.","['Kalland, K H', 'Langhoff, E', 'Bos, H J', 'Gottlinger, H', 'Haseltine, W A']","['Kalland KH', 'Langhoff E', 'Bos HJ', 'Gottlinger H', 'Haseltine WA']","['Division of Human Retrovirology, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02115.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,New Biol,The New biologist,9000976,IM,"['Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleolus/*metabolism', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Gene Products, env/metabolism', 'Gene Products, rex/*physiology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics/metabolism', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'RNA, Messenger/*biosynthesis']",1991/04/01 00:00,1991/04/01 00:01,['1991/04/01 00:00'],"['1991/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,New Biol. 1991 Apr;3(4):389-97.,"['0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (Gene Products, rex)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",,"['Rex', 'env']",,['CA36974/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,

We report significant sequence similarity between the predicted proto-dbl product and the products of CDC24, a Saccharomyces cerevisiae cell division cycle gene required for correct budding and establishment of cell polarity, and bcr, a gene implicated in the pathogenesis of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). Of 925 residues of the predicted proto-dbl protein, a stretch of 238 residues showed 29% and 22% identity over a region of similar length of the CDC24 and bcr proteins, respectively. When evolutionarily conservative substitutions were taken into account, the similarities were 68.8% and 71.6% for proto-dbl/CDC24 and proto-dbl/bcr gene products, respectively. Moreover, all three sequences were predicted to be markedly hydrophilic over this region. Very small deletions within the conserved region completely abolished transforming activity of dbl, while extensive deletion outside of this region had no effect. Even substitutions over a small stretch of close similarity with the other proteins substantially impaired transforming activity. Cells transformed by the dbl oncogene, like cdc24 mutants arrested at the nonpermissive temperature, form multinucleate cells.

The present studies have examined the regulation of EGR-1 gene expression in human U-937 monocytic leukemia cells treated with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). The results demonstrate that GM-CSF rapidly and transiently increases EGR-1 gene expression in U-937 cells. Similar findings were obtained in GM-CSF-treated human monocytes. We also show that the regulation of EGR-1 expression by GM-CSF is a pertussis toxin-sensitive event. The results of nuclear run-on assays further demonstrate that the EGR-1 gene is constitutively transcribed in untreated U-937 cells and that GM-CSF has little effect on this rate of transcription. Inhibition of protein synthesis with cycloheximide also had no detectable effect on EGR-1 gene transcription but was associated with superinduction of EGR-1 mRNA levels in GM-CSF-treated cells. Moreover, the half-life of GM-CSF-induced EGR-1 transcripts was prolonged from 33 to 70 min following inhibition of protein synthesis. Taken together, the results indicate that GM-CSF activates signaling pathways which regulate EGR-1 gene expression through a pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein and that these events increase EGR-1 mRNA levels by a posttranscriptional mechanism. This GM-CSF-dependent regulation of EGR-1 expression may provide a mechanism for transducing signals to the nucleus that are involved in the control of gene transcription.","['Bernstein, S H', 'Kharbanda, S M', 'Sherman, M L', 'Sukhatme, V P', 'Kufe, D W']","['Bernstein SH', 'Kharbanda SM', 'Sherman ML', 'Sukhatme VP', 'Kufe DW']","['Laboratory of Clinical Pharmacology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cell Growth Differ,Cell growth & differentiation : the molecular biology journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9100024,IM,"['Cell Line, Transformed', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', 'Monocytes/metabolism', '*Pertussis Toxin', '*RNA Processing, Post-Transcriptional', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Virulence Factors, Bordetella/*pharmacology', 'Zinc Fingers/*genetics']",1991/06/01 00:00,1991/06/01 00:01,['1991/06/01 00:00'],"['1991/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cell Growth Differ. 1991 Jun;2(6):273-8.,"['0 (Virulence Factors, Bordetella)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.4.2.31 (Pertussis Toxin)']",,['ERG-1'],,"['CA01092/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA42802/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

The characteristics of this reaction in liver microsomes have been determined. Omission of an NADPH-generating system or NADH resulted in a greater than 75% reduction in the production of 8,25-(OH)2-3-oxoneo-D3. In the absence of the cytosolic fraction, 25-OHD3 was converted to products that comigrated with 8,25-(OH)2-3-oxoneo-D3 on a silica column developed with hexane-isopropanol, thereby preventing quantitation. Production of 8,25-(OH)2-3-oxoneo-D3 was unaffected by EDTA and was stimulated by N,N'-diphenyl-p-phenylenediamine. Both progesterone and pregnenolone inhibited production of 8,25-(OH)2-3-oxoneo-D3; inhibition by progesterone was greater than that by pregnenolone. 8,25-(OH)2-3-Oxoneo-D3 did not bind the thymus receptor for 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol [1,25-(OH)2D3] at concentrations 10-fold higher than that of 1,25-(OH)2D3. The lack of affinity of 8,25-(OH)2-3-oxoneo-D3 for the 1,25-(OH)2D3 receptor suggests that this metabolite is a degradative product of 25-OHD3, which might be produced when 25-OHD3 concentrations in the liver are excessive.

Human BM mononuclear cells were contaminated with 10% of the lymphoma line CA46 and then cultured in liquid medium containing 1000 U/ml of rIL2 and/or LAK autologous to the used BM. At the end of coculture the growth of residual tumour cells and of CFU-GM were evaluated by clonogenic assay. No tumour cell growth was observed in 5/5 independent experiments after 18 h of coculture with LAK. No significant inhibition of CFU-GM growth was also noted. Subsequently, the effect of LAK on BM obtained from four leukaemic patients and contaminated with 20-50% of their own AML and ALL cells was studied using MAb as a tool for identifying leukaemic cells. LAK eliminated 24-78% of contaminating cryopreserved uncultured autologous leukaemic cells. In five cases the BM was contaminated by a low (2%) amount of ALL cells. In these patients the monoclonal heavy chain rearrangement typical of ALL was no longer visible after coculture with LAK.

To find out why, the first phase of the United Kingdom (UK) Medical Research Council (MRC) childhood ALL trial, UKALL VIII, was designed to see whether similar results to the United States Children's Cancer Study Group (CCSG) could be obtained in the U.K. using an identical protocol (CCG 162). Protocol 162 was one of a series of regimens devised by the American Children's Cancer Study Group in the 1970s and was used specifically for their average risk patients (all children with ALL with an initial white cell count up to 50 x 10(9)/l except those aged 3-6 years with white cell counts under 10 x 10(9)/l). One arm (1A) of their study was adopted by the MRC for all children in the U.K. aged 0-14 years with confirmed ALL. Eight hundred and twenty-nine consecutive patients were entered between 1980 and 1984. The first 199 patients formed a single arm study as per the original protocol 162 (arm 1A), but the subsequent 630 children were randomized to receive or not two doses of daunorubicin on the first 2 d of induction. This randomization was an attempt to answer the important question as to whether event-free survival was influenced by the use of four rather than three induction agents. A second randomization between 2 and 3 years continuing therapy was also introduced at this stage as it had been by the CCSG in their protocol. With a minimum follow up period of more than 5 years, disease-free survival for the whole group is 55%, a considerable improvement on all previous UKALL trials. Results for patients directly comparable with those in CCSG 162 ('average risk' patients) and their American counterparts were similar. Daunorubicin was associated with more early deaths but improved disease-free survival for those achieving remission. More children relapsed who stopped treatment after 2 years than those who continued for 3, but this was balanced by increased treatment mortality in the third year. The fact that for UKALL VIII the results were similar to those of the CCSG suggests that previous MRC protocols were not sufficiently sustained and intensive, particularly during the maintenance phase of treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Eden, O B', 'Lilleyman, J S', 'Richards, S', 'Shaw, M P', 'Peto, J']","['Eden OB', 'Lilleyman JS', 'Richards S', 'Shaw MP', 'Peto J']","['Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Edinburgh.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/administration & dosage', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cranial Irradiation', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/administration & dosage', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/radiotherapy', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage', 'Prognosis', 'Random Allocation', 'United Kingdom', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",1991/06/01 00:00,1991/06/01 00:01,['1991/06/01 00:00'],"['1991/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1991.tb04415.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1991 Jun;78(2):187-96. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1991.tb04415.x.,"['5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two rabbits inoculated with 1 x 10(7) HTLV-I-infected human MT-2 cells and two with infected rabbit cells from a line established in this laboratory (RLT-P), developed latent HTLV-I infection as detected by seroconversion 10 weeks after infection and by detection of HTLV-I sequences in the DNA of peripheral blood lymphocytes after amplification by polymerase chair reaction (PCR) 15 weeks after infection. The rabbits remained clinically normal and had normal blood counts. Six months after infection, the four HTLV-infected rabbits and two noninfected controls were challenged by the intradermal inoculation of 1 x 10(6) Treponema pallidum into eight sites on the shaved back. The lesions of two of the HTLV-I-infected rabbits had a time course similar to non-HTLV-I-infected controls and were completely healed by 4 weeks. The lesions of one of the other two rabbits with progressive disease began to heal about 7 weeks after T. pallidum challenge. The cutaneous lesions in the other rabbit remained dark-field positive and became a confluent eschar at 8 weeks; healing only after treatment with penicillin. Four months after the primary challenge none of the six rabbits previously challenged with T. pallidum had developed lesions after rechallenge and thus expressed chancre immunity. These results demonstrate that rabbits with latent HTLV-I infections may have defective cell-mediated immunity.","['Tseng, C T', 'Sell, S']","['Tseng CT', 'Sell S']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Texas Medical School, Houston 77225.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses,AIDS research and human retroviruses,8709376,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Chancre/*complications/immunology', 'Concanavalin A/immunology', 'DNA, Viral/analysis', 'HTLV-I Infections/*complications/immunology/microbiology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/biosynthesis', 'Lymphocyte Activation/immunology', 'Male', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Rabbits', 'Superinfection/*immunology', 'Syphilis, Cutaneous/*complications/immunology']",1991/03/01 00:00,1991/03/01 00:01,['1991/03/01 00:00'],"['1991/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/aid.1991.7.323 [doi]'],ppublish,AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses. 1991 Mar;7(3):323-31. doi: 10.1089/aid.1991.7.323.,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '11028-71-0 (Concanavalin A)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Quel, has been recognized for its host-mediated induction of antitumor and antimicrobial activities in mice. Intravenous administration of PSK, in association with OK-432 (Picibanil), transiently induced endogenous production of a cytotoxic factor (CF) (possibly tumor necrosis factor, TNF) in normal mice. The ability to produce CF depended greatly on both dose and interval between administration of the PSK and OK-432. Although PSK has been reported to contain several active ingredients, unfractionated PSK has been used in almost all experiments performed so far. We recently reported that, of the four subfractions separated by successive filtration through membrane filters, only the highest molecular weight fraction F4 (MW greater than 200 kD) induced significant antimicrobial activity in mice. PSK stimulated the NBT-reducing activity of mouse peritoneal macrophages and the iodination (incorporation of radioactive iodine into an acid-insoluble fraction) of human peripheral blood polymorphonuclear cells (PMN). Among the subfractions of PSK, the highest molecular weight fraction F4, and the fraction precipitated at pH 4.0-4.5 (Fr. 4), stimulated macrophage NBT-reducing activity and PMN iodination most. In contrast, natural and chemically modified glucans had little or no stimulating activity. PSK, F4 or Fr. 4 additively or synergistically stimulated TNF-induced cytotoxicity against L-929 cells, differentiation of human myelogenous leukemia cell lines toward monocytes/macrophages, and iodination of human peripheral blood PMN. The active PSK subfractions significantly reduced the down regulation of specific 125I-TNF or 125I-IFN-gamma binding to cellular receptors. These data suggest that (i) immunopotentiation activity of PSK might be ascribed, at least in part, to stimulation of cytokine action and production, and (ii) PSK might have some unique structural features.","['Sakagami, H', 'Aoki, T', 'Simpson, A', 'Tanuma, S']","['Sakagami H', 'Aoki T', 'Simpson A', 'Tanuma S']","['First Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Showa University, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,IM,"['Adjuvants, Immunologic/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cytokines/*pharmacology', 'Escherichia coli/drug effects', 'Macrophages/drug effects/*physiology', 'Neutrophils/drug effects/*physiology', 'Proteoglycans/*pharmacology']",1991/03/01 00:00,1991/03/01 00:01,['1991/03/01 00:00'],"['1991/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Res. 1991 Mar-Apr;11(2):993-9.,"['0 (Adjuvants, Immunologic)', '0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Proteoglycans)', '3X48A86C8K (polysaccharide-K)']",40,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This compound was effective at all doses tested (0.1, 1 and 10 ng/ml) after at least a 24 hour incubation period. The murine MXT and human MDA-MB231 tumor cells were about 10 fold less sensitive than the other cell lines.

Cell differentiation is accompanied by biochemical and molecular changes which show that the inducer is active at different molecular levels. Among the chemical agents that are able to induce cell differentiation, the anticancer drugs are of great interest for the emerging study of in vitro and in vivo models for differentiation treatment. Cis-diamminedichloroplatinum II (CDDP), a crosslinking DNA compound, is usually employed at a high dosage in treating solid tumors. We have demonstrated that CDDP was also able to induce K562 cells towards erythroid differentiation. In our experiment 2.5 micrograms/ml of CDDP caused expression of alpha-globin chain gene and production of haemoglobulin. Continuous presence of the drug was not necessary to induce the cell to produce haemoglobin. Five days after CDDP treatment, the expression of c-myc oncogene had risen, while H3 histone mRNA expression fell to undetectable levels within 24 hours. Transferrin (Tf) receptor mRNA was reduced but later (about 48 hours) than c-myc and H3 messenger RNAs. The inhibition of cell proliferation was correlated both with the reduced expression of Tf receptor mRNA and low expression of the protein. However, expression of the cytoskeleton vimentin gene was only slightly affected during the time-course of the experiment. Data show that at least three phases were present in the irreversible CDDP induction of haemoglobin synthesis in the K562 cell. The erythroid differentiation was first preceded by a rise of c-myc mRNA, which probably precommits the cell towards the erythroid lineage. The mRNA levels of the cell-cycle dependent genes, H3 and Tf receptor, decreased and inhibition of DNA synthesis and loss of cell proliferation were detected. Finally, the alpha-globin chain gene was actively transcribed and the cell produced haemoglobin.","['Marazzi, L', 'Parodi, M T', 'Di Martino, D', 'Ferrari, S', 'Tonini, G P']","['Marazzi L', 'Parodi MT', 'Di Martino D', 'Ferrari S', 'Tonini GP']","[""Department of Haematology and Oncology, G.

Fludarabine, a fluorinated purine analog, appears to be active in CLL and multiple myeloma. Deoxycoformycin, an adenosine analog, showed good activity in the treatment of hairy cell leukemia and T-cell neoplasias. 2-chloro-deoxyadenosine has recently been introduced into the treatment of CLL and hairy-cell leukemia refractory to deoxycoformicin. Tiazofurin, an antimetabolite which interferes with nicotine-adenine-dinucleotide (NAD) metabolism, has been applied in CML blast crisis. Other agents include 13-cis retinoic acid and 1, 25-dihydroxy vitamin D3 as differentiation inducers, and homoharringtonine, an alkylating agent which is widely used for ANLL treatment in China. Among new anthracyclines, aclarubicin, idarubicin, THP-adriamycin and fluoro-adriamycin should be mentioned. Mitoxantrone, a substituted anthraquinone, has successfully been applied in the treatment of relapsed and refractory ANLL. Amsacrine (m-AMSA), finally, is a synthetic aminoacridine which intercalates into DNA and inhibits DNA topoisomerase II. m-AMSA is not cross-resistant to anthracyclines and has been particularly active in ANLL treatment. Studies using m-AMSA alone or in combination revealed comparable results to anthracycline--containing regimens. Cardiotoxicity of the anthracycline congestive type has not been observed with m-AMSA. The EORTC Leukemia Cooperative Group has successfully used m-AMSA in several trials prepositioning this drug stepwise: from relapsed and refractory ANLL, into intensive maintenance treatment during first remission in ANLL, and, still on-going, into intensive consolidation.","['Jehn, U', 'Heinemann, V']","['Jehn U', 'Heinemann V']","['Department of Hematology/Oncology, University of Munich, FRG.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Amsacrine/*therapeutic use', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Chronic Disease', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy']",1991/03/01 00:00,1991/03/01 00:01,['1991/03/01 00:00'],"['1991/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Res. 1991 Mar-Apr;11(2):705-11.,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '00DPD30SOY (Amsacrine)']",67,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recovery after alpha-interferon administration.,685-9,"Peripheral blood mitogen - induced cellular cytotoxicity (MICC) and natural killer- cell cytotoxicity (NKCC) were assessed in 25 patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Both MICC and NKCC were examined under the same experimental conditions using the 18 hr chromium release assay, except that cultures for MICC were stimulated in vitro by the addition of phytohemagglutinin (PHA). Patients' MICC was found significantly reduced, in relation to controls (p less than 0.001), but significantly higher than patients' NKCC (p less than 0.001). Furthermore, patients CD3+ cells and CD4+ cells, as well as the CD4+/CD8+ ratio, were significantly decreased (p less than 0.01, p less than 0.001 and p less than 0.001, respectively), while CD8+ cells and CD16+ cells were within normal limits. No relationship was noted between patients' MICC and total lymphocyte count or any lymphocyte subpopulation. In eleven patients who were subsequently subjected to a-interferon (a-IFN) administration, MICC values were found within normal range one month after the cessation of alpha-IFN, while NKCC values were significantly increased (p less than 0.01), but they still remained below the lower limit of the control (p less than 0.001). Percentages of CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+ cells, as well as the CD4+/CD8+ ratio, did not change after alpha-IFN, but the absolute numbers of CD3+ cells and CD8+ cells were significantly reduced. A statistically significant rise was noted in CD16+ cells. Post- IFN rises in MICC did not correlate with lymphocyte subpopulations. The findings indicate that MDS patients display very low MICC, which can be restored by alpha-IFN administration. The cause of this disturbance and the mechanism of its restoration by alpha-IFN remain unclear.","['Eliopoulos, G', 'Constantopoulou, M', 'Coulocheri, S', 'Vaiopoulos, G', 'Eliopoulos, A', 'Yataganas, X']","['Eliopoulos G', 'Constantopoulou M', 'Coulocheri S', 'Vaiopoulos G', 'Eliopoulos A', 'Yataganas X']","['Department of Hematology, University of Crete School of Medicine, University Hospital of Heraklion, Greece.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,IM,"['Aged', 'Anemia/immunology/therapy', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/drug effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interferon alpha-2', 'Interferon-alpha/*therapeutic use', 'Killer Cells, Natural/drug effects/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/immunology/therapy', 'Male', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*immunology/therapy', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Reference Values']",1991/03/01 00:00,1991/03/01 00:01,['1991/03/01 00:00'],"['1991/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Res. 1991 Mar-Apr;11(2):685-9.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Interferon alpha-2)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Moreover, FLC were 100 fold more sensitive to tTAuP when the cells were grown in the absence of FCS but in the presence of synthetic medium (BMS). When the cytotoxic effect was measured after short-term exposure (60 min) followed by 72 hr incubation in drug-free medium, unexpectedly, DOX-RFLC were 8 fold more sensitive [ID50 = 1.5 microM] than FLC [ID50 = 12 microM] to tTAuP. When FLC were exposed 60 min at different temperatures (4, 25 or 37 degrees C) to tTAuP prior to 72 hr incubation in drug free medium, the ID50 was achieved at 20, 13 and 3 microM respectively). In contrast, when DOX-RFLC were treated in similar conditions, the cytotoxic activity of tTAuP did not vary following exposure at 4, 25 or 37 degrees C. Although the mechanism of action of gold compounds is still unknown we have assumed that tTAuP cytotoxicity is related to the ease with which it is accumulated. This assumption was supported by the analysis of tTAuP incorporation by SXRF. The results reported here show that tTAuP accumulates rapidly in the cell and is distributed in the cytoplasmic and the nuclear fractions. It is suggested that accumulation is mediated by passive diffusion. However, the detection of gold binding to DNA in complexes resistant to solvent treatments suggests that interaction with macromolecules can be mediated by the formation of covalently bound complexes.","['Arizti, M P', 'Garcia-Orad, A', 'Sommer, F', 'Silvestro, L', 'Massiot, P', 'Chevallier, P', 'Gutierrez-Zorrilla, J M', 'Colacio, E', 'Martinez de Pancorbo, M', 'Tapiero, H']","['Arizti MP', 'Garcia-Orad A', 'Sommer F', 'Silvestro L', 'Massiot P', 'Chevallier P', 'Gutierrez-Zorrilla JM', 'Colacio E', 'Martinez de Pancorbo M', 'Tapiero H']","['Dpto. de Biologia Celular, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad del Pais Vasco, Vizcaya, Spain.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*metabolism', 'Biological Transport', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Culture Media', 'DNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Organogold Compounds', 'Organometallic Compounds/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Organophosphorus Compounds/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Theophylline/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism/pharmacology']",1991/03/01 00:00,1991/03/01 00:01,['1991/03/01 00:00'],"['1991/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Res. 1991 Mar-Apr;11(2):625-8.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Culture Media)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Organogold Compounds)', '0 (Organometallic Compounds)', '0 (Organophosphorus Compounds)', '137025-15-1 (8-thiotheophyllinate-triphenylphosphine gold(I))', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'C137DTR5RG (Theophylline)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Each of these DNA parameters identified subgroups with a significantly different survival time and duration of chronic phase.

Thus, newborn mice inoculated with Friend murine leukemia virus develop severe early hemolytic anemia before appearance of erythroleukemia. To identify the retroviral determinants regulating these effects, we used chimeric infectious constructions and site-directed point mutations between a virulent Friend murine leukemia virus strain and a naturally occurring variant attenuated in lytic and leukemogenic effects. We found that severe hemolytic anemia was always associated with higher numbers of blood reticulocytes with budding retroviral particles. Furthermore, a remarkably conservative leucine to isoleucine change in the extracellular SU component of the retroviral envelope was sufficient to attenuate this lytic effect. Also, this leucine at position 348 of the envelope precursor protein was located within the only stretch of five amino acids that is conserved in the extracellular SU component of all murine, feline, and primate type C and type D retroviral envelopes. This observation suggested an important structural function for this yet undescribed conserved sequence of the envelope. Lastly, we observed that lytic and leukemogenic effects were attenuated by a deletion of a second repeat in the transcriptional enhancer region of the viral long terminal repeats of the variant strain.","['Sitbon, M', ""d'Auriol, L"", 'Ellerbrok, H', 'Andre, C', 'Nishio, J', 'Perryman, S', 'Pozo, F', 'Hayes, S F', 'Wehrly, K', 'Tambourin, P']","['Sitbon M', ""d'Auriol L"", 'Ellerbrok H', 'Andre C', 'Nishio J', 'Perryman S', 'Pozo F', 'Hayes SF', 'Wehrly K', 'Tambourin P', 'et al.']","[""Laboratoire d'Immunologie et Oncologie des Maladies Retrovirales, Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale Unite, Paris, France.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Anemia, Hemolytic/*microbiology', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/*pathogenicity', 'Gene Products, env/*physiology', 'Hemolysis', 'Isoleucine', 'Leucine', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*microbiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligonucleotides/chemistry', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*physiology']",1991/07/01 00:00,1991/07/01 00:01,['1991/07/01 00:00'],"['1991/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.88.13.5932 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1991 Jul 1;88(13):5932-6. doi: 10.1073/pnas.88.13.5932.,"['0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (Oligonucleotides)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '04Y7590D77 (Isoleucine)', 'GMW67QNF9C (Leucine)']",,,,,PMC51992,,,,,,,,,,,

In the human tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) gene segment between nucleotides 300 and 1150, the specific methylation profile in the DNA from human granulocytes and monocytes is maintained in three cases of myeloid leukemia. In one such case, all 5-methyl-2'-deoxycytidine residues have been replaced by cytidine. In a chronic lymphatic T-cell leukemia, all 5-methyl-2'-deoxycytidine residues have been substituted by cytidine. In normal B lymphocytes, in two cases of chronic lymphatic B-cell leukemias and two cases of non-Hodgkin lymphomas, all 5'-CG-3' sequences in this gene segment are devoid of methylation. In the TNF-beta gene, DNA methylation is decreased in several examples of acute or chronic myeloid leukemias in comparison to normal human granulocytes or monocytes, whose DNA is almost completely methylated between nucleotides 700 and 900. In human T and B lymphocytes, the main producers of TNF-beta, in three instances of chronic lymphatic leukemias and two cases of non-Hodgkin lymphomas, all 5'-CG-3' sequences are unmethylated in this region. The DNA from the human HeLa cell line is highly methylated at all 5'-CG-3' sequences in the TNF-alpha and -beta genes.

We have cloned ETR101 cDNA whose mRNA was induced immediate early (30 min) and transiently by TPA. The mRNA is superinduced by addition of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide. The sequence of ETR101 cDNA (1826 base pairs) reveals that (i) it will encode a protein of 223 amino acids with a formula molecular weight of 24,200, (ii) the amino acid sequence is highly homologous to mouse chx1 protein whose mRNA was found recently to be enhanced in activated T lymphocytes in response to cycloheximide, (iii) the amino acid sequence is also weakly homologous to jun family gene products, and (iv) in the mRNA 3'-flanking region, there is a unique GUUUG sequence which is complementary to a part of B1 repetitive sequence and may be involved in mRNA degradation. ETR101 mRNA is induced by TPA in a wide variety of leukemia cells including myeloid, T-lymphoid, and B-lymphoid lineages. We have found that this mRNA is also induced by okadaic acid, a protein phosphatase inhibitor, and that TPA or cycloheximide act synergistically with okadaic acid. In addition, the induction is inhibited by protein kinase C inhibitors. Therefore, ETR101 mRNA level is controlled, either directly or indirectly, by protein phosphorylation.","['Shimizu, N', 'Ohta, M', 'Fujiwara, C', 'Sagara, J', 'Mochizuki, N', 'Oda, T', 'Utiyama, H']","['Shimizu N', 'Ohta M', 'Fujiwara C', 'Sagara J', 'Mochizuki N', 'Oda T', 'Utiyama H']","['Life Science Group, Faculty of Integrated Arts and Sciences, Hiroshima University, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'DNA/genetics', 'Ethers, Cyclic/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Macrophages/*drug effects', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Okadaic Acid', 'Phosphorylation', 'RNA, Messenger/drug effects/genetics/metabolism', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Transcription Factors/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1991/07/05 00:00,1991/07/05 00:01,['1991/07/05 00:00'],"['1991/07/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/07/05 00:01 [medline]', '1991/07/05 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(18)98873-3 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1991 Jul 5;266(19):12157-61.,"['0 (Ethers, Cyclic)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '1W21G5Q4N2 (Okadaic Acid)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,,,,,,"['GENBANK/M62831', 'GENBANK/M63255', 'GENBANK/M63926', 'GENBANK/M63975', 'GENBANK/M63976', 'GENBANK/M63977', 'GENBANK/M63978', 'GENBANK/M64074', 'GENBANK/M64075', 'GENBANK/M64076']",,,,,,,,,

Although the mechanism by which TCR ligation regulates PLC activity is unknown, recent studies suggest that coupling of this receptor complex to PLC activity is dependent on an intermediate protein tyrosine phosphorylation event(s). In the present study, we demonstrate that antibody-mediated TCR cross-linkage results in the tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-gamma 1. Stimulation of the TCR for 30 s induced a 4-5-fold increase in the level of PLC activity recovered in anti-phosphotyrosine (Tyr(P)) antibody immunoprecipitates from stimulated Jurkat cells. The appearance of PLC activity in the immunoprecipitates preceded the onset of phosphoinositide hydrolysis in vivo, which began 30-60 s after TCR ligation. Furthermore, the TCR-mediated increase in anti-Tyr(P) antibody-bound PLC activity was inhibited by staurosporine at drug concentrations identical with those required for in vivo inhibition of TCR-dependent phosphoinositide breakdown. Immunoblot analyses demonstrated that TCR ligation dramatically increased the level of tyrosine-phosphorylated PLC-gamma 1 present in anti-Tyr(P) antibody immunoprecipitates from stimulated Jurkat cells. These results strongly suggest that the TCR complex expressed by Jurkat cells is functionally coupled to the phosphoinositide-dependent signaling pathway through the tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-gamma 1.","['Secrist, J P', 'Karnitz, L', 'Abraham, R T']","['Secrist JP', 'Karnitz L', 'Abraham RT']","['Department of Pharmacology, Mayo Foundation, Rochester, Minnesota 55905.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Alkaloids/pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Humans', 'Hydrolysis', 'Inositol Phosphates/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Leukemia/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*metabolism', 'Staurosporine', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Type C Phospholipases/*metabolism', 'Tyrosine/*metabolism']",1991/07/05 00:00,1991/07/05 00:01,['1991/07/05 00:00'],"['1991/07/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/07/05 00:01 [medline]', '1991/07/05 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(18)98869-1 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1991 Jul 5;266(19):12135-9.,"['0 (Alkaloids)', '0 (Inositol Phosphates)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 3.1.4.- (Type C Phospholipases)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)']",,,,['CA 52995-P4/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Our results demonstrate that BT-A and BT-B cells have low sensitivity to the cytotoxic activity of mononuclear cells (MNC) and NK cells. Cytotoxicity of MNC or NK cells against both tumor cell lines is enhanced during co-culture of the effector cells with the target cells, which suggests that BT-A and BT-B cells provide the signals which could activate MNC to exert cytotoxicity. In contrast to NK cells, IL-2-generated LAK cells showed profound cytotoxicity to BT-A and BT-B within 24 h. In addition to cellular cytotoxicity to bladder tumor cells, we also tested the effect of recombinant interleukin 1 beta (rIL-1 beta), recombinant tumor necrosis factor (rTNF), and the supernatants of co-culture of MNC or LAK cells with bladder tumor cells. The results show no cytotoxic or growth-promoting activity of rIL-1, rTNF, or the crude culture supernatants on bladder tumor cells. We found that LAK cells, but not macrophages or NK cells, may play a major role in cellular cytotoxicity against the two bladder tumor cell lines tested. From this finding we conclude that activation of LAK cells may be one important mechanism induced by adjuvant bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) therapy leading to effective prevention of urothelial bladder carcinoma reappearance.","['Wang, M H', 'Flad, H D', 'Bohle, A', 'Chen, Y Q', 'Ulmer, A J']","['Wang MH', 'Flad HD', 'Bohle A', 'Chen YQ', 'Ulmer AJ']","['Department of Immunology and Cell Biology, Forschungsinstitut Borstel, F.R.G.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Immunol Lett,Immunology letters,7910006,IM,"['Animals', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/drug effects', 'Fibrosarcoma/immunology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1/pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Lymphokine-Activated/*immunology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/immunology', 'Lipopolysaccharides/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology', 'Urinary Bladder Neoplasms/*immunology']",1991/03/01 00:00,1991/03/01 00:01,['1991/03/01 00:00'],"['1991/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0165-2478(91)90150-9 [pii]', '10.1016/0165-2478(91)90150-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Immunol Lett. 1991 Mar;27(3):191-7. doi: 10.1016/0165-2478(91)90150-9.,"['0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Chemotaxis and random motility were measured using a modified agarose technique with C5a and a bacterial filtrate of E. coli as the chemoattractants. Two types of inhibitors were found: chemotactic factor inhibitors and cell-directed inhibitors. The type of inhibitor as well as the specificity of the inhibitor for the chemoattractant (C5a or bacterial filtrate) varied depending upon the underlying neoplasm. Cell-directed inhibitors were reversible and none of the inhibitors affected random motility. Contrary to previous reports, the chemotactic factor inhibitors were heat-stable (p less than 0.001). Morphometric analysis of inhibited and non-inhibited cells using scanning electron photomicrographs showed a significant alteration in shape of the inhibited cells (p less than 0.003).

To corroborate further the role of H-2Kk in tumorigenesis of AKR leukemia, we have, in this study, expressed antisense H-2Kk RNA in a high-H-2Kk-expressing and poorly tumorigenic AKR thymoma cell line 369. The down-regulation of H-2Kk molecules in the transfected 369 clones rendered them more tumorigenic in syngeneic AKR/J mice. The increase in oncogenicity correlates well with a concomitant reduction in their susceptibility to tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes in vitro. These results suggest the relevance of H-2Kk molecules in the immune surveillance of AKR tumors.","['Hui, K M', 'Sim, B C', 'Foo, T T', 'Oei, A A']","['Hui KM', 'Sim BC', 'Foo TT', 'Oei AA']","['Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology, National University of Singapore, Kent Ridge.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Cell Immunol,Cellular immunology,1246405,IM,"['Animals', 'Clone Cells', 'DNA, Antisense/*genetics', 'Down-Regulation', '*Gene Expression', 'H-2 Antigens/analysis/*genetics/immunology', 'Interferon Type I/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred AKR', 'RNA, Antisense/analysis', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology', 'Thymoma/genetics/*immunology/pathology', 'Thymus Neoplasms/genetics/*immunology/pathology', '*Transfection']",1991/08/01 00:00,1991/08/01 00:01,['1991/08/01 00:00'],"['1991/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0008-8749(91)90383-M [pii]', '10.1016/0008-8749(91)90383-m [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Immunol. 1991 Aug;136(1):80-94. doi: 10.1016/0008-8749(91)90383-m.,"['0 (DNA, Antisense)', '0 (H-2 Antigens)', '0 (H-2K(K) antigen)', '0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (RNA, Antisense)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite the uniform 4-HC concentration, we observed heterogeneity in CFU-GM survival and the kinetics of engraftment. We have now analysed patient and graft characteristics for 154 patients undergoing autologous transplantation with 4-HC purged grafts to further define this heterogeneity. Patients transplanted for the treatment of malignant lymphoma reached a peripheral blood granulocyte count of greater than 0.5 x 10(9)/l (median, 20 versus 40 days; p less than 0.001) and platelet transfusion independence (median, 30 versus 70 days; p less than 0.001) significantly faster than patients transplanted for acute non-lymphoblastic leukemia. Other diagnostic groups were intermediate. These differences were independent of graft CFU-GM content. Multiple other patient and graft factors including patient age, peripheral blood counts on day of harvest, and amounts of other hematopoietic progenitors also predicted the kinetics of engraftment in univariate and multivariate analysis. Cytomegalovirus infection during the aplastic period predicted a delay in granulocyte (p = 0.024) but not platelet recovery (p = 0.174). This analysis demonstrates that multiple patient, graft, and post-transplant factors predict the engraftment capacity of autografts, and the kinetics of engraftment with 4-HC purged grafts.

The early proliferative effect of GM-CSF was correlated with an increased expression of type I regulatory subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (RI alpha). Treatment with an RI alpha antisense oligodeoxynucleotide suppressed the GM-CSF-inducible cell proliferation and differentiation. Conversely, an RII beta antisense oligodeoxynucleotide, which suppresses the RII beta and causes a compensatory increase in RI alpha level, greatly enhanced the early proliferative input and the differentiation induced by GM-CSF.

In this paper we propose common criteria for the clinical staging of all hairy cell leukemia patients (treated or untreated), as well as for the assessment of responses to therapy. These criteria are absence or presence of disease-related symptoms and disease progression. Based on these criteria we propose that hairy cell leukemia patients in the most favorable stage of the functional system, non-symptomatic Stable Disease (nsSD), do not require treatment. Only in patients with disease-related symptoms and/or signs of disease progression is treatment justified and necessary. No symmetry was observed between the functional stages and Jansen's stages. For evaluation of responses to treatment, our stages were more sensitive than the Leeds criteria. Experimental evidence enables the differentiation of patients with non-symptomatic stable disease from those with symptomatic and/or progressive disease.","['Porzsolt, F', 'Demeter, J', 'Heimpel, H']","['Porzsolt F', 'Demeter J', 'Heimpel H']","['Department Medicine III (Hematology and Oncology), University of Ulm, FRG.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Onkologie,Onkologie,7808556,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Injections, Subcutaneous', 'Interferon Type I/*administration & dosage', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*pathology/surgery/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging/*methods', 'Pentostatin/administration & dosage', 'Prognosis', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Splenectomy']",1991/02/01 00:00,1991/02/01 00:01,['1991/02/01 00:00'],"['1991/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1159/000216944 [doi]'],ppublish,Onkologie. 1991 Feb;14(1):44-8. doi: 10.1159/000216944.,"['0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '395575MZO7 (Pentostatin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous analysis of tumor susceptibility in normal versus inbred and F1 mice bearing the B cell deficiency associated with the xid mutation of CBA/N mice demonstrated an inverse relationship between the tumorigenicity of the RI-28, a radiation-induced leukemia of the CBA/H strain, and the pooled anti-RI-28 serum NAb levels in mice with the same genetic origins. No relationship with tumor susceptibility was seen with NK cell or in vivo activated macrophage cytolysis. Flow-cytometric determination of antitumor serum NAb bled from individual male and female (CBA/N X CBA/J)F1 mice 1 week prior to the threshold tumor inoculation has revealed extensive heterogeneity within the NAb levels of each sex. A comparative analysis of tumor fate with NAb activity revealed that tumors appeared in only 26.3% of animals with a mean fluorescence channel binding above 60 channels in contrast with 77.3% of animals with lower NAb levels. These data extend to the level of individual hosts the support for an inverse relationship between host NAb activity and tumor susceptibility. In addition, subsequent analysis of serum antitumor NAb levels, splenic NK cytolysis and in vitro lymphokine-activated macrophage activity with all three mediators originating from the same individual F1 mice showed no consistent correlations between these natural resistance activities, arguing for the exclusion of deficiencies in NK cell or macrophage function as the basis for the differential tumor susceptibility in individual F1 mice.","['Bennet, R D', 'Chow, D A']","['Bennet RD', 'Chow DA']","['Department of Immunology, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Nat Immun Cell Growth Regul,Natural immunity and cell growth regulation,8407979,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/*blood', 'Crosses, Genetic', 'Female', '*Immunity, Innate/genetics', 'Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes/complications/genetics/*immunology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology', 'Macrophage Activation', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred CBA', 'Mice, Mutant Strains', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*etiology']",1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Nat Immun Cell Growth Regul. 1991;10(1):45-55.,"['0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Specific central nervous system (CNS) therapy was randomized to either six injections of intrathecal methotrexate (IT MTX) alone or to six injections of IT MTX with cranial radiation (2,400 cGy). Both cranial radiation and dexamethasone offered increased protection against CNS relapse as the first site of failure over IT MTX alone.

Patients who completed the intensive portion of therapy in continuous complete remission were ranked by the percentage of protocol required drug delivered from the initiation of therapy to that date. No association was found between delivery of any single drug and subsequent disease-free survival. However, when patients were ranked by the sum of the percentages of protocol vincristine, l-asparaginase, and anthracycline delivered, children in the approximate middle and lower tertiles were 3 and 5 times more likely to have had a subsequent relapse than were those in the upper tertile (P = 0.025, test for trend). Delivery of the full protocol prescribed dose of these agents may have been critical, but corroboration is certainly needed. Only prospective trials can determine if children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and unfavorable presenting features might benefit from greater use of vincristine, l-asparaginase, and/or anthracycline.","['Gaynon, P S', 'Steinherz, P G', 'Bleyer, W A', 'Finklestein, J Z', 'Miller, D R', 'Reaman, G H', 'Sather, H N', 'Hammond, G D']","['Gaynon PS', 'Steinherz PG', 'Bleyer WA', 'Finklestein JZ', 'Miller DR', 'Reaman GH', 'Sather HN', 'Hammond GD']","['University of Wisconsin Medical Center, Madison.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Med Pediatr Oncol,Medical and pediatric oncology,7506654,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/analysis', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Remission Induction', 'Steroids/administration & dosage', 'Survival Rate', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/mpo.2950190404 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Pediatr Oncol. 1991;19(4):221-7. doi: 10.1002/mpo.2950190404.,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Steroids)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",,,,"['CA 02971/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 13539/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 17829/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast, this serine protease inhibitor was undetectable in 79 patients with other subtypes of acute myeloid leukemia or other hematological malignancies. Serial serum PAI-2 determinations in 16 patients with acute leukemia at presentation, during therapy, remission, and relapse revealed that in the five patients with M4-M5, elevated PAI-2 levels rapidly normalized under therapy and during remission, but increased again in the patients with a relapse associated with an M4-M5 phenotype. Thus, PAI-2 seems to be a marker highly specific for the active stages of monocytic leukemia, i.e. presentation and relapse.

We evaluated anorectal/perineal infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 16 children with malignant diseases seen over 27 years. In 12 of 16 patients, leukemia was the underlying malignancy (ALL 10, AML 2), and in 13 of 16, severe neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count less than 500/mm3) was present at diagnosis. Cultures of the lesions showed multiple organisms in 14 of 16 patients with Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species, and Enterococcus being the most frequent coexisting organisms. All positive blood cultures grew P aeruginosa exclusively. Of three patients with necrotizing infections, two had complete resolution with medical treatment alone; the other patient who developed this problem while on terminal care died. In none of the 16 patients was a major operation (debridement or diversion) performed. Five patients died, three of whom were considered terminally ill when the anorectal infections occurred. Four of the five deaths occurred before 1974. Since then, only 1 of 7 patients died. Excluding the three terminally ill patients, the success rate of medical therapy alone is 85% (11/13). The antibiotic regimen should include an aminoglycoside in synergistic combination with anti-Pseudomonas penicillin. These results suggest that operative management may have no role in the management of anorectal infections caused by P aeruginosa in children with cancer.","['Angel, C', 'Patrick, C C', 'Lobe, T', 'Rao, B', 'Pui, C H']","['Angel C', 'Patrick CC', 'Lobe T', 'Rao B', 'Pui CH']","[""Section of Pediatric Surgery, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38101.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Pediatr Surg,Journal of pediatric surgery,0052631,IM,"['Administration, Topical', 'Adolescent', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Anus Diseases/etiology/microbiology/*therapy', 'Baths', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Hematologic Tests', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*complications/drug therapy', 'Ointments/administration & dosage', 'Pseudomonas Infections/etiology/microbiology/*therapy', 'Rectal Diseases/etiology/microbiology/*therapy', 'Retrospective Studies']",1991/04/01 00:00,1991/04/01 00:01,['1991/04/01 00:00'],"['1991/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0022-3468(91)91001-F [pii]', '10.1016/0022-3468(91)91001-f [doi]']",ppublish,J Pediatr Surg. 1991 Apr;26(4):487-92; discussion 492-3. doi: 10.1016/0022-3468(91)91001-f.,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Ointments)']",,,,"['CA-21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-23099/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Previously, we reported the isolation of major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-restricted mH antigen-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) from patients with graft-vs.-host disease or rejection after HLA-identical BMT. We have demonstrated that mH antigens can be recognized on hematopoietic progenitor cells, and residual recipient CTL specific for mH antigens expressed on donor hematopoietic progenitor cells may be responsible for graft rejection in spite of intensive conditioning regimens in HLA-identical BMT. Here, we investigated whether mH antigen-specific CTL directed against the mH antigens HA-1 to HA-5 and the male-specific antigen H-Y were capable of antigen-specific inhibition of in vitro growth of clonogenic leukemic precursor cells. We demonstrate that mH antigen-specific CTL against all mH antigens tested can lyse freshly obtained myeloid leukemic cells, that these mH antigen-specific CTL can inhibit their clonogenic leukemic growth in vitro, and that this recognition is MHC restricted. We illustrate that leukemic (precursor) cells can escape elimination by mH antigen-specific CTL by impaired expression of the relevant MHC restriction molecule. We suggest that mH antigen-specific MHC-restricted CTL may be involved in vivo in the graft-vs.-leukemia reactivity after BMT.","['Falkenburg, J H', 'Goselink, H M', 'van der Harst, D', 'van Luxemburg-Heijs, S A', 'Kooy-Winkelaar, Y M', 'Faber, L M', 'de Kroon, J', 'Brand, A', 'Fibbe, W E', 'Willemze, R']","['Falkenburg JH', 'Goselink HM', 'van der Harst D', 'van Luxemburg-Heijs SA', 'Kooy-Winkelaar YM', 'Faber LM', 'de Kroon J', 'Brand A', 'Fibbe WE', 'Willemze R', 'et al.']","['Department Hematology, University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/immunology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Clone Cells', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Graft Rejection', 'Graft vs Host Disease', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*immunology/surgery', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*immunology/surgery', 'Major Histocompatibility Complex', 'Minor Histocompatibility Antigens/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology']",1991/07/01 00:00,1991/07/01 00:01,['1991/07/01 00:00'],"['1991/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1084/jem.174.1.27 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 1991 Jul 1;174(1):27-33. doi: 10.1084/jem.174.1.27.,['0 (Minor Histocompatibility Antigens)'],,,,,PMC2118892,,,,,,,,,,,

The possibility that these higher molecular weight species may represent novel CD44 isoforms containing additional protein sequence was investigated. CD44 cDNA clones were isolated from a plasmid-based expression library prepared from KG1a mRNA. One of the three clones obtained (clone 2.3) was found to encode a CD44 molecule of approximately 130 kD in transfected COS cells. Sequences analysis indicated that the molecule encoded by this cDNA clone, designated CD44R1, was essentially identical to CD44 except for the presence of an additional 132 amino acids inserted into the extracellular domain. This inserted region is rich in serine and threonine residues that may serve as sites of O-linked glycosylation, and contains a potential site of N-linked glycosylation and a potential site of chondroitin sulphate attachment. PCR analysis using primers that flank the inserted region present within CD44R1 identified an additional CD44 isoform, designated CD44R2, that contains only the last 69 amino acids present within the unique region of CD44R1. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells and granulocytes from normal individuals and patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia, polycythemia vera, or acute myelomonocytic leukemia, express both CD44R1 and CD44R2. In contrast, CD44R1 and CD44R2 appear to be differentially expressed in various CD44-positive cell lines. Thus KG1a, and the Epstein-Barr Virus-transformed B cell lines WalkDR4 and Way-1 express both CD44 and the CD44 isoforms CD44R1 and CD44R2, while the myeloid cell lines HL60 and U937 express high levels of CD44, but only very low levels of CD44R1 and CD44R2.

The spontaneous CMMoL colonies were substantially suppressed by the addition of either anti-IL-6 or anti-granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) antibodies to the colony assay system: the addition of both anti-IL-6 and anti-GM-CSF antibodies resulted in greater than 80% inhibition of the colony formation by CMMoL cells.

Previous studies have reported that the growth inhibitors TGF beta and TNF alpha downregulate c-myc mRNA levels, suggesting the possibility that these agents may exert some of their phenotypic effects via c-myc downregulation. Our study demonstrates that although both growth inhibitors produce a similar decrease in c-myc protein synthesis, TNF alpha produces a greater growth inhibition and differentiation induction in HL-60 cells. Combined addition of anti-myc oligomer with either growth inhibitor produces no additive effect.

The decision to start with i.v. or s.c. administration was by random selection. Toxicity was comparable between i.v. and s.c. administration. At the highest dose level, 63% (five of eight) of the patients developed moderate to severe toxicity. Increases in the absolute neutrophil count showed a dose-response relationship and were more pronounced with s.c. than i.v. administration.

To overcome kinetic resistance and to increase cytotoxicity, the cells were exposed to Ara-C in liquid culture medium for extended time periods, that is, 5 and 10 days. Subsequently the number of surviving clonogenic cells was determined in a semi-solid assay. All cultures were stimulated with the combination of recombinant human interleukin 3 (rhIL-3), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (rhGM-CSF), and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (rhG-CSF) to induce optimal cell proliferation. In comparison to normal clonogenic bone marrow cells (granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming units, CFU-GM) 5-day Ara-C exposure resulted in an equal to a slightly more effective kill of leukemic colony-forming cells (CFU-L). The Ara-C dose resulting in 50% inhibition (ID50) was 1.6 +/- 1.6 x 10(-8) M for CFU-L (n = 9) and 6.7 +/- 4.3 x 10(-8) M for CFU-GM (n = 4, p = 0.096). Prolongation of the Ara-C exposure time from 5 to 10 days increased the cytotoxicity towards the majority of the leukemic clonogenic cells (ID50: 0.8 +/- 0.6 x 10(-8) M) but not towards CFU-GM (ID50: 5.7 +/- 2.8 x 10(-8) M). Overall, significantly more leukemic clonogenic cells than normal CFU-GM were killed after 10 days of exposure to Ara-C (p = 0.039). These results indicate that leukemic clonogenic cells can be eradicated preferentially by prolonged exposure to low dosages of Ara-C in the presence of hematopoietic growth factors with relative preservation of the normal hematopoietic progenitor cells.","['Van Der Lely, N', 'De Witte, T', 'Muus, P', 'Raymakers, R', 'Preijers, F', 'Haanen, C']","['Van Der Lely N', 'De Witte T', 'Muus P', 'Raymakers R', 'Preijers F', 'Haanen C']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospital Nijmegen, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,IM,"['Bone Marrow/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Clone Cells', 'Cytarabine/*pharmacology', 'Granulocytes/drug effects/physiology', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*physiopathology', 'Macrophages/drug effects/physiology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Stem Cells/drug effects/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1991/05/01 00:00,1991/05/01 00:01,['1991/05/01 00:00'],"['1991/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1991 May;19(4):267-72.,"['0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)']",,,,,,['Exp Hematol. 1992 Mar;20(3):374-5.

These tRNA species are synthesized with guanine in the wobble position (tRNAG); this guanine can then be replaced with queuine by the action of the enzyme tRNA-guanine ribosyltransferase. In the present report, we show that tRNAG levels increased in response to the induction of erythroid differentiation of murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells. We also found that tRNA-guanine ribosyltransferase was significantly inhibited by tetrahydrobiopterin. MEL cells showed a transient threefold increase in tetrahydrobiopterin levels 6 to 12 h after exposure of the cells to inducers such as DMSO or tetramethylurea. The increase in tetrahydrobiopterin preceded the increase in tRNAG which in turn preceded the appearance of phenotypic changes characteristic of differentiation. By contrast, a mutant MEL cell line unable to differentiate in response to inducers showed no change in the level of tetrahydrobiopterin or of tRNAG upon exposure to DMSO. N-acetylserotonin, a well-characterized inhibitor of tetrahydrobiopterin synthesis, prevented the DMSO-mediated increase in tetrahydrobiopterin in normal MEL cells. N-acetylserotonin also inhibited the increase in tRNAG levels and the appearance of phenotypic differentiation in these cells.","['Parniak, M A', 'Andrejchyshyn, S', 'Marx, S', 'Kleiman, L']","['Parniak MA', 'Andrejchyshyn S', 'Marx S', 'Kleiman L']","['Lady Davis Institute for Medical Research, Sir Mortimer B.

Numerical aberrations of chromosome 8 were established by conventional banding techniques. Trisomy 8 was found in four patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and three with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Three additional patients with MDS exhibited an extra chromosome 8 in only one metaphase. In five of the seven trisomy cases, the presence of the trisomy 8 clone was confirmed by in situ hybridization (ISH). In one case of AML with trisomy 8, detected by GTG-banding, no significant numbers of cells containing three spots were found using the alphoid repetitive probe; however, hybridization with a chromosome 8-specific library revealed that the alleged extra chromosome 8 was a translocation chromosome containing only the long arm of chromosome 8. Due to a lack of material, it was not possible to achieve optimal ISH results on the trisomy 8 bone marrow cells of patient 7. In the three MDS patients with a single trisomy 8 metaphase, a slight, albeit significant, increase of trisomy 8 interphase cells was found with ISH.

K562.4CF cells exhibited elevated methotrexate uptake relative to parental cells, attributable to a 10-fold increased influx Vmax. The rate of methotrexate efflux in K562.4CF cells was somewhat increased (55%) as well. The transport system in K562.4CF cells had similar and high apparent binding affinities for methotrexate and 5-formyltetrahydrofolate and a markedly reduced affinity for folic acid, properties typically associated with the ""classical"" methotrexate/tetrahydrofolate cofactor transporter in tumor cells. Methotrexate uptake in K562.4CF cells decreased substantially under nonselective conditions; high levels of transport were restored in 0.4 nM 5-formyltetrahydrofolate. Treatment of parental and K562.4CF cells with N-hydroxysuccinimide methotrexate inhibited methotrexate influx. N-Hydroxysuccinimide-[3H]methotrexate (700 nM) radiolabeled a broadly migrating band at Mr 76,000-85,000. Incorporation from N-hydroxysuccinimide-[3H]methotrexate into this band was increased 7-fold in K562.4CF over parental cells and was blocked by unlabeled methotrexate, (6S)-5-formyltetrahydrofolate, or, to a lesser extent, folic acid. Whereas incubation with endoglycosidase F had no effect on the electrophoretic migration of the labeled protein, treatment with endoglycosidase F and glycopeptidase F, or endo-beta-galactosidase, reduced the apparent molecular weight to Mr approximately 52,000 or approximately 58,000, respectively. These results suggest that the high-affinity transporter in K562.4CF cells is an N-linked glycoprotein containing internal beta-galactosidic linkages in, or immediately after, unbranched poly-N-acetyllactosamine sequences. Differences in the level of glycosylation may, in part, account for the disparity in the apparent sizes of the homologous folate transport proteins from human and murine cells.","['Matherly, L H', 'Czajkowski, C A', 'Angeles, S M']","['Matherly LH', 'Czajkowski CA', 'Angeles SM']","['Developmental Therapeutics Program, Michigan Cancer Foundation, Detroit 48201.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Affinity Labels', 'Biological Transport', 'Carrier Proteins/*metabolism', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leucovorin/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*metabolism', 'Methotrexate/*metabolism', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1991/07/01 00:00,1991/07/01 00:01,['1991/07/01 00:00'],"['1991/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1991 Jul 1;51(13):3420-6.,"['0 (Affinity Labels)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', 'Q573I9DVLP (Leucovorin)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epidemiological data have indeed shown that patients who developed these diseases represent a small percentage of HTLV-I infected individuals living in restricted geographical areas. Experiments performed at molecular and cellular levels have revealed that HTLV-I plays an essential role in the initiation of the lymphoproliferative process. Indeed, viral particles deliver a mitogenic signal to human resting T lymphocytes. After proviral integration, two regulatory proteins--Tax and Rex--are controlling the replicative cycle of HTLV-I. The Tax protein trans-activates the proviral transcription and the Rex protein is essential in the synthesis of viral structural proteins. Furthermore, the Tax protein induces the transcription of several cellular genes involved in T-cell activation and proliferation. Studies are now aimed at identifying HTLV-I target cells among precursors of the T cell lineage and at unravelling the role of HTLV-I in the secondary events leading to leukemogenesis.","['Gazzolo, L', 'Duc Dodon, M']","['Gazzolo L', 'Duc Dodon M']","[""Laboratoire d'immuno-virologie moleculaire et cellulaire, UMR30-CNRS/UCBL, faculte de medecine Alexis-Carrel, Lyon, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",France,Bull Cancer,Bulletin du cancer,0072416,IM,"['Gene Products, rex/metabolism', 'Gene Products, tax/metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/metabolism/*microbiology', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/metabolism']",1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Bull Cancer. 1991;78(3):291-8.,"['0 (Gene Products, rex)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']",27,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Dose response was evaluated by assigning each x-ray procedure a score based on estimated bone marrow dose. X-ray exposure was not associated with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, one of the few malignant conditions never linked to radiation (relative risk [RR], 0.66).

Ph1 chromosome was considered to be specific for the disease and was frequently used as an important marker for the definite diagnosis. However, in mid-1970s, some cases with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) were also found to have Ph1 chromosome in the leukemic cells. Therefore, Ph1 chromosome seemed to be non-specific for the diagnosis of CML. In 1980s, molecular-biology techniques were applied in the fields of leukemia research. As a result, clear differences were demonstrated between the two diseases (CML and ALL with Ph1 chromosome, respectively) at the molecular level using oncogene concept. In this review, molecular-genetic constructions of ABL, BCR and BCR-ABL hybrid genes in CML, as well as m-BCR-ABL hybrid gene in Ph1 positive ALL are focused in detail.

Analysis of a large number of leukemias revealed that activated N-ras oncogenes were observed preferentially in AML, AMoL, T-ALL and Null-ALL but rarely in CML and B-cell leukemia. These results suggest that N-ras oncogene plays an important role in human leukemogenesis. Activated N-ras oncogenes were also detected in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) that is considered to be a preleukemic disease. MDS patients bearing an activated N-ras oncogene frequently showed leukemic progression of the disease, suggesting that an activated N-ras oncogene can be a critical factor for prognosis of MDS patients. Thus, detection of an activated N-ras oncogene is useful for diagnosis, prognostic evaluation and therapeutic decision. Recently, we demonstrated that detection of the minimal residual disease by analysis of N-ras oncogene can lead to improvement of the remission rate in leukemias. Moreover, we made it possible to screen N-ras oncogene by a sensitive non-radioactive method.

The envelope-related (env) gene and LTR are the only functional elements of the viral genome. The env-coded glycoprotein gp55 has been shown to be responsible for target cell specificity and for the short latency of the disease caused by SFFV. This molecule closely resembles the env coded proteins gp70 + p15E of mink cell focus inducing viruses (MCFV). The only substantial differences between these two env genes are a large deletion spanning 585 nucleotides in the middle of the F-SFFV gene and a frameshift mutation near the 3' end leading to a modified and shortened membrane anchor in the mature protein. To determine if the large deletion and/or the frameshift mutation are capable of changing the properties of a nonpathogenic MCFV into those of an acutely pathogenic SFFV we introduced these changes into the env gene of an MCFV. The results show that the mutated MCFV is as acutely pathogenic as F-SFFV. We therefore conclude that the modified membrane anchor of gp55 and the change caused by the large deletion are the essential determinants of the high pathogenicity of SFFV.,"['Friedrich, R', 'Friedrich, U', 'Maennle, G']","['Friedrich R', 'Friedrich U', 'Maennle G']","['Division of Molecular Oncology, Justus Liebig University, Giessen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,IM,"['Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', '*Cloning, Molecular/methods', 'Frameshift Mutation', 'Gene Products, env/*genetics', 'Genes, env', 'Leukemia, Experimental/genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Mink Cell Focus-Inducing Viruses/genetics/pathogenicity', 'Rats', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Spleen Focus-Forming Viruses/*genetics/pathogenicity', 'Transfection']",1991/07/01 00:00,1991/07/01 00:01,['1991/07/01 00:00'],"['1991/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0042-6822(91)90147-4 [doi]'],ppublish,Virology. 1991 Jul;183(1):343-50. doi: 10.1016/0042-6822(91)90147-4.,"['0 (Gene Products, env)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Within this sequence a short purine-rich sequence adjacent to the amber codon, highly conserved among different retroviruses, appears essential for M-MuLV suppression.

Mutations were found associated with (i) Burkitt lymphoma (9/27 biopsies; 17/27 cell lines) and its leukemic counterpart L3-type B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (5/9), both of which also carry activated c-myc oncogenes, and (ii) B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (6/40) and, in particular, its stage of progression known as Richter's transformation (3/7). Mutations were not found at any significant frequency in other types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma or acute lymphoblastic leukemia. In many cases, only the mutated allele was detectable, implying loss of the normal allele. These results suggest that (i) significant differences in the frequency of p53 mutations are present among subtypes of neoplasms derived from the same tissue; (ii) p53 may play a role in tumor progression in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia; (iii) the presence of both p53 loss/inactivation and c-myc oncogene activation may be important in the pathogenesis of Burkitt lymphoma and its leukemic form L3-type B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.","['Gaidano, G', 'Ballerini, P', 'Gong, J Z', 'Inghirami, G', 'Neri, A', 'Newcomb, E W', 'Magrath, I T', 'Knowles, D M', 'Dalla-Favera, R']","['Gaidano G', 'Ballerini P', 'Gong JZ', 'Inghirami G', 'Neri A', 'Newcomb EW', 'Magrath IT', 'Knowles DM', 'Dalla-Favera R']","['Department of Pathology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Mutation', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*genetics']",1991/06/15 00:00,1991/06/15 00:01,['1991/06/15 00:00'],"['1991/06/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/06/15 00:01 [medline]', '1991/06/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.88.12.5413 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1991 Jun 15;88(12):5413-7. doi: 10.1073/pnas.88.12.5413.,['0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)'],,,,"['CA40236/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA44029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'EY06337/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC51883,,,,,,,,,,,

We have identified markers (D21S65 and a Not I boundary clone, Not-42, referred to as probe B) flanking the chromosome 21 translocation breakpoint (21q22.3) that demonstrate physical linkage in normal genomic DNA, by using at least three restriction endonucleases (Not I, Sac II, and BssHII), and that are located not more than 250-280 kilobases apart. Pulsed-field gel analysis of DNA from somatic cell hybrids containing the 8;21 translocation chromosomes demonstrates rearrangement of these markers. A 470-kilobase yeast artificial chromosome, YAC-Not-42, has been isolated that contains both probes. Mapping of lambda subclones constructed from YAC-Not-42 suggests that greater than 95% (25/26 probes tested) of the yeast artificial chromosome DNA is located on the proximal (D21S65) side of the breakpoint. In situ hybridization studies using metaphase chromosomes from five acute myelogenous leukemia patients with the 8;21 translocation confirmed these results and demonstrated the translocation of probe B to the derivative chromosome 8. A chromosome walk of approximately 39 kilobases from probe B has allowed identification of the breakpoint in DNA from a somatic cell hybrid containing the derivative chromosome 8. Since probe B contains conserved DNA sequences and is in close proximity to the translocation breakpoint, it may represent a portion of the involved gene on chromosome 21.","['Gao, J', 'Erickson, P', 'Gardiner, K', 'Le Beau, M M', 'Diaz, M O', 'Patterson, D', 'Rowley, J D', 'Drabkin, H A']","['Gao J', 'Erickson P', 'Gardiner K', 'Le Beau MM', 'Diaz MO', 'Patterson D', 'Rowley JD', 'Drabkin HA']","['Division of Medical Oncology, University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, Denver.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Blotting, Southern', '*Chromosomes, Fungal', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8', 'DNA Probes', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Gene Library', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae/*genetics', '*Translocation, Genetic']",1991/06/01 00:00,1991/06/01 00:01,['1991/06/01 00:00'],"['1991/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.88.11.4882 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1991 Jun 1;88(11):4882-6. doi: 10.1073/pnas.88.11.4882.,"['0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",,,,['P01HD017449/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States'],PMC51771,,,,,,,,,,,

To determine whether infection by MCF viruses altered the growth phenotype of retrovirus-induced T-cell lymphomas, a Moloney murine leukemia virus-induced interleukin-2 (IL-2)-dependent rat T-cell lymphoma line (4437A) was infected with MCF-247, modified MCF-V33 (mMCF-V33), or NZB-xenotropic (NZB-X) virus. The effects of virus infection on the IL-2 dependence of these cells was examined by cultivating them in the absence of IL-2. After IL-2 withdrawal, the uninfected and NZB-X-infected cells went through a crisis period characterized by massive death. All the independently maintained cultures of MCF- and mMCF-V33-infected cells, on the other hand, became IL-2 independent without a crisis. All the polytropic virus-infected IL-2-independent cultures contained a population of cells that was polyclonal with regard to polytropic provirus integration. Over this polyclonal background each culture produced multiple clones of cells that were selected rapidly after IL-2 withdrawal. Furthermore, the resulting MCF- or mMCF-V33-infected IL-2-independent cells retained the expression of IL-2 receptor. These data show that MCF and mMCF-V33 viruses may alter the growth phenotype of a T-cell lymphoma line and suggest that their effect on cell growth may be due to the direct interaction of the MCF envelope glycoprotein with cellular components, perhaps the IL-2 receptor.","['Tsichlis, P N', 'Bear, S E']","['Tsichlis PN', 'Bear SE']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, PA 19111.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Genes, Viral', 'Interleukin-2/*pharmacology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/immunology', 'Mink Cell Focus-Inducing Viruses/*genetics', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Phenotype', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/genetics/physiology', 'Restriction Mapping']",1991/06/01 00:00,1991/06/01 00:01,['1991/06/01 00:00'],"['1991/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.88.11.4611 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1991 Jun 1;88(11):4611-5. doi: 10.1073/pnas.88.11.4611.,"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)']",,,,"['CA-06927/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-38047/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'RR-05539/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",PMC51715,,,,,,,,,,,

Hexadecylphocholine (He-PC2), the APC prototype, inhibited PKC competitively with respect to phosphatidylserine an noncompetitively with respect to CaCl2, both with an apparent Ki of about 15 microM. Inhibition of PKC by He-PC2 was selective, since cyclic AMP dependent protein kinase and Ca2+/calmodulin dependent protein kinase II were relatively unaffected. He-PC2 inhibited TPA-induced depletion of PKC and TPA-stimulated phosphorylation of cellular proteins in HL60 cells. TPA-induced differentiation of HL60 cells was also inhibited by He-PC2, and this inhibition was synergistic or additive to the effects of 1-(5-isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine (H-7), a PKC inhibitor. The present findings are consistent with the hypothesis that inhibition of PKC might be related, in part, to the antineoplastic effect of He-PC2 and ether lipid analogs such as ET-18-OCH3 (1-octadecyl-2-methyl-glycero-3-phosphocholine).","['Shoji, M', 'Raynor, R L', 'Fleer, E A', 'Eibl, H', 'Vogler, W R', 'Kuo, J F']","['Shoji M', 'Raynor RL', 'Fleer EA', 'Eibl H', 'Vogler WR', 'Kuo JF']","['Department of Medicine (Hematology/Oncology), Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia 30322.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Lipids,Lipids,0060450,IM,"['Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Phospholipid Ethers/pharmacology', 'Phosphoproteins/isolation & purification', 'Phosphorylation', 'Phosphorylcholine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase C/*metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology']",1991/02/01 00:00,1991/02/01 00:01,['1991/02/01 00:00'],"['1991/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF02544009 [doi]'],ppublish,Lipids. 1991 Feb;26(2):145-9. doi: 10.1007/BF02544009.,"['0 (Phospholipid Ethers)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '107-73-3 (Phosphorylcholine)', '1Y6SNA8L5S (edelfosine)', '53EY29W7EC (miltefosine)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,,,"['CA-29850/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-36777/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-15696/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Identification and functional analysis of nuclear protein binding sites.,11965-74,"The promoter of the human gamma-globin gene confers tissue specificity as well as developmental stage specificity to gamma gene expression. Earlier work in our laboratory suggested that a fragment of the gamma-globin promoter between -300 and -137 base pairs upstream of the transcription start site contributed to the developmental specificity of the promoter. In this paper, we have mapped potential regulatory elements within this upstream region of the gamma promoter by a combination of in vitro DNA-protein binding assays and functional determinations of promoter strength in transient expression studies. Four sites between -300 and -130 bind proteins present in nuclear extracts of erythroid and non-erythroid cell lines. Mutation of these binding sites by internal base substitution determined that three of the four influence overall promoter strength in transient assays. We have focused on two protein binding sites, -246 to -212 and -195 to -170, that have been reported to bind erythroid-specific factors. The erythroid binding protein NF-E1 and a ubiquitous octamer protein footprint the -195 to -170 site. While internal mutation of this site did not significantly alter promoter strength, a point mutation at position -175 that is associated with hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin increased the activity of a promoter construct 20-fold in erythroid cells. A detailed mutational analysis of this site suggests that NF-E1 binding is necessary but not sufficient for activation of the promoter by the -175 mutation, and we propose that a second protein or co-activator is required. The nucleotides between -246 and -212 appear to bind a complex of at least three proteins, at the core of which is a protein binding to a string of dA:dT residues. This complex also appears to form on the 3' A gamma-globin enhancer, and homologous sites have been identified within the locus activating region of the beta-globin cluster, suggesting that this element may mediate long range interactions with distant regulatory elements.","['McDonagh, K T', 'Lin, H J', 'Lowrey, C H', 'Bodine, D M', 'Nienhuis, A W']","['McDonagh KT', 'Lin HJ', 'Lowrey CH', 'Bodine DM', 'Nienhuis AW']","['Clinical Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, Bethesda, Maryland 28092.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'DNA Fingerprinting', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Globins/*genetics', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/pathology', 'Methylation', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Transcription, Genetic']",1991/06/25 00:00,1991/06/25 00:01,['1991/06/25 00:00'],"['1991/06/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/06/25 00:01 [medline]', '1991/06/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(18)99051-4 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1991 Jun 25;266(18):11965-74.,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A review of the literature confirms that rearrangements of 12p, mainly at band 12p13, are nonrandom chromosomal abnormalities in all subtypes of NHL, as in other malignant blood disorders.

For many years it was suspected that chromosome abnormalities might cause cancer by alteration of specific genes or their expression. Significant recent developments in our understanding of the molecular consequences of the Ph translocation strengthen that assumption. The Ph translocation generates a hybrid gene consisting of 5' regulatory, promotor, and exon sequences of the bcr gene on chromosome 22 fused to 3' exons and polyadenylation/termination sequences of the ABL proto-oncogene from chromosome 9. It is well established that fusion of bcr and abl genes plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of CML and ALL. Molecular methods can therefore be used as diagnostic tools to detect the Ph chromosome. Presently, the model of oncogenesis provided by our knowledge of how the abl proto-oncogene becomes activated as a result of the Ph translocation is one of the clearest models of oncogene activation. Despite the progress made, many areas remain to be explored. One important question is, how the hybrid protein is involved in leukemia. Research aimed at investigating the normal function of abl and bcr may be important in efforts to understand their abnormal functioning in leukemia and to increase our understanding of the disease.","['Heisterkamp, N', 'Groffen, J']","['Heisterkamp N', 'Groffen J']","[""Department of Pathology, Children's Hospital of Los Angeles, California 90027.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Hematol Pathol,Hematologic pathology,8707764,IM,"['Animals', 'Blast Crisis/genetics', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 22/ultrastructure', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9/ultrastructure', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', '*Genes, abl', 'Genes, p53', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/pathology', 'Mice', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Phosphoproteins/genetics/physiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/genetics/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl/physiology', 'Recombination, Genetic', '*Translocation, Genetic']",1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Hematol Pathol. 1991;5(1):1-10.,"['0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl)']",81,"['BCR', 'abl', 'fes/fps', 'm-bcr', 'p53', 'ras', 'src', 'v-abl']",,"['CA 47456/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA47073/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Because of the potential myelosuppressive side effects of 5-FC it was the aim of the current study to evaluate the recovery of hematopoietic cells after intensive antileukemic therapy in patients receiving ampho B and 5-FC treatment for proven or suspected systemic fungal infections. The study population comprised 87 patients who were treated by standard chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) at first diagnosis or relapse. Twenty-two patients underwent systemic antifungal therapy consisting of ampho B (3 to 10 mg/kg/d) and 5-FC (150 mg/kg/d) for 3 to 33 days (median, 12 days). The remaining 65 patients served as controls to assess the hematologic recovery time (TR) as defined by the interval between the onset of chemotherapy and the post-treatment rise of granulocyte levels to greater than 500 cmm and thrombocyte levels to greater than 20,000 cmm. In patients receiving antifungal therapy, a significant prolongation of TR was observed with a median TR of 29 days compared with a median TR of 24 days (P = 0.0016) for the control group. No correlation was found between TR and the total dose of either ampho B or 5-FC or the type of antileukemic regimen. A possibly direct myelosuppressive effect of a fungal infection was unlikely to explain the findings because the ampho B/5-FC treatment was started in patients with proven or only suspected fungal infections, causing a similar delay of TR in both groups. The present data strongly suggest a myelosuppressive effect of ampho B/5-FC antifungal treatment in patients after intensive chemotherapy for acute leukemias.","['Hiddemann, W', 'Essink, M E', 'Fegeler, W', 'Zuhlsdorf, M', 'Sauerland, C', 'Buchner, T']","['Hiddemann W', 'Essink ME', 'Fegeler W', 'Zuhlsdorf M', 'Sauerland C', 'Buchner T']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Munster, Federal Republic of Germany.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Amphotericin B/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Candidiasis/*drug therapy/etiology', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Flucytosine/*pharmacology', 'Hematopoiesis/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Immune Tolerance/drug effects', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Random Allocation']",1991/07/01 00:00,1991/07/01 00:01,['1991/07/01 00:00'],"['1991/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19910701)68:1<9::aid-cncr2820680103>3.0.co;2-u [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1991 Jul 1;68(1):9-14. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19910701)68:1<9::aid-cncr2820680103>3.0.co;2-u.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '7XU7A7DROE (Amphotericin B)', 'D83282DT06 (Flucytosine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In April 1983, the Pediatric Oncology Group (POG) adopted for these patients an intensive treatment protocol (POG 8303) consisting of a four-drug systemic reinduction (prednisone, vincristine, daunorubicin, and asparaginase), a brief intensive consolidation phase with teniposide and cytarabine, and a 2-year program of continuation chemotherapy with weekly rotating drug pairs (vincristine/cyclophosphamide and teniposide/cytarabine) with or without (by randomization) four-drug reinforcement pulses every 16 weeks. Bilateral testicular radiation (2600 cGy) was administered during reinduction, and intrathecal chemoprophylaxis was given every 4 to 6 weeks. Among 38 eligible study patients with OTR, 5 had prior or concominant extramedullary relapse in other sites. The median duration of complete remission before OTR was 27 months (range, 10 to 42 months). All 38 patients achieved clinical remission after reinduction.

PCR analysis provides a sensitive tool for detecting a progressive rise in host cell numbers which may predict clinical relapse.","['Browne, P V', 'Lawler, M', ""O'Riordan, J"", 'Humphries, P', 'McCann, S R']","['Browne PV', 'Lawler M', ""O'Riordan J"", 'Humphries P', 'McCann SR']","[""Department of Haematology/Oncology, St James's Hospital, Dublin, Ireland.""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,IM,"['Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*adverse effects/pathology', 'Cell Cycle', 'Chimera', 'Chromosomes', 'DNA/analysis', 'Female', '*Graft Rejection', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/pathology/ultrastructure', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Metaphase', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/pathology/surgery']",1991/02/01 00:00,1991/02/01 00:01,['1991/02/01 00:00'],"['1991/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1991 Feb;7(2):167-9.,['9007-49-2 (DNA)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One was the relative consistency of autotransplant results in lymphomas and solid tumors which appear to be about 20% 3-year disease-free survival in persons with advanced disease regardless of diagnosis. Why is this and what does it mean? Perhaps this is the limit of additional cures achievable by dose escalation; further escalations may not be more effective or may trade increased anticancer efficacy for toxicity. It is also essential to be certain that this seemingly improved outcome over conventional therapy is not the result of subject-selection or time-to-treatment biases and whether these persons are cured. The second point relates 'optimal' timing of autotransplants. Certainly, better overall results are achieved by selecting the 'best' subjects. However, prognosis factors for autotransplant outcome resemble those for chemotherapy. Therefore, a potential consequence of selecting the best subjects for autotransplants is to exclude precisely those persons most likely to benefit. Needed is a balance between improving autotransplant results and rescuing the greatest number of subjects. How to achieve this balance is presently uncertain. Presently, there is much enthusiasm for autotransplants; their use is expanding very rapidly. In some cancers and disease states autotransplants likely represent the most effective current therapy. However, this is not known to be so for most autotransplants. Controlled and/or randomized trials are now needed to evaluate efficacy in other settings. Hopefully, these studies will be performed soon.","['Gale, R P', 'Armitage, J O', 'Dicke, K A']","['Gale RP', 'Armitage JO', 'Dicke KA']","['Department of Medicine, UCLA School of Medicine 90024-1678.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,IM,"['Acute Disease', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation/pathology/physiology', 'Breast Neoplasms/surgery', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/surgery', 'Lymphoma/surgery', 'Multiple Myeloma/surgery', 'Neuroblastoma/surgery', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",1991/02/01 00:00,1991/02/01 00:01,['1991/02/01 00:00'],"['1991/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1991 Feb;7(2):153-7.,['0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)'],19,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We compared the recovery of AML-CFU with six different freezing techniques in five myelocytic leukemic (AML) patients to the recovery of normal progenitors (CFU-GM and BFU-E) from control marrows. The recovery for AML-CFU (9.3% +/- 3.1, SE) was significantly lower (p less than 0.001) than for normal CFU-GM (48.4% +/- 4.6) and BFU-E (46.2% +/- 5.0). Moreover, the cloning efficiency of frozen AML-CFU was significantly reduced in 4/5 cases (p less than 0.001), as compared to fresh samples, while it was unaltered in 3/4 normal controls. There were no significant differences between the six freezing techniques, indicating that they are equally efficient for normal progenitors and inefficient for leukemic progenitors. These results indicate that human leukemic progenitors are more sensitive to cryopreservation than normal CFU-GM and BFU-E. These findings suggest that cryopreservation per se may have a purging effect in the context of autologous bone marrow transplantation for acute myelocytic leukemia in complete remission.","['Allieri, M A', 'Lopez, M', 'Douay, L', 'Mary, J Y', 'NGuyen, L', 'Gorin, N C']","['Allieri MA', 'Lopez M', 'Douay L', 'Mary JY', 'NGuyen L', 'Gorin NC']","[""Laboratoire d'Etude de l'Hematopoiese, Hopital St Antoine, Paris, France.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,IM,"['*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cell Survival/physiology', 'Cryopreservation/*methods', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*pathology/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1991/02/01 00:00,1991/02/01 00:01,['1991/02/01 00:00'],"['1991/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1991 Feb;7(2):101-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sixteen patients had disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Three of the patients with DIC (two with M3, one with M5 leukemia) had a marked isolated factor-X deficiency (factor X:C 21%, 33%, and 41%, respectively). Another four patients had a mild isolated factor-X deficiency (factor X:C 55%-68%). In these seven patients the remaining liver-synthesized clotting factors (factors II, VII, IX, V) as well as serum albumin and cholinesterase were within the normal range. Liver disease or vitamin-K deficiency could therefore be excluded. In none of the 141 patients without DIC was a marked isolated factor X deficiency observed; two patients had moderately reduced factor X:C levels but normal liver-synthesized proteins. Induction treatment led to the control of DIC with an almost parallel increase of fibrinogen and factor X up to normal in all patients with factor-X deficiency who achieved complete remission. In one patient, recurrence of leukemia was associated with reoccurrence of DIC and marked factor-X deficiency. We conclude that there is a coincidence of isolated factor-X deficiency and DIC in some patients with ANLL. In some patients, this factor-X deficiency may be severe enough to contribute to the bleeding tendency.","['Pabinger, I', 'Bettelheim, P', 'Dudczak, R', 'Hinterberger, W', 'Kyrle, P A', 'Niessner, H', 'Schwarzinger, I', 'Speiser, W', 'Lechner, K']","['Pabinger I', 'Bettelheim P', 'Dudczak R', 'Hinterberger W', 'Kyrle PA', 'Niessner H', 'Schwarzinger I', 'Speiser W', 'Lechner K']","['First Department of Medicine, University of Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Cytarabine/therapeutic use', 'Daunorubicin/therapeutic use', 'Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation/blood/*complications', 'Factor X/metabolism', 'Factor X Deficiency/blood/*complications', 'Female', 'Fibrinogen/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/*complications/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",1991/05/01 00:00,1991/05/01 00:01,['1991/05/01 00:00'],"['1991/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF01703144 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 1991 May;62(5):174-9. doi: 10.1007/BF01703144.,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '9001-29-0 (Factor X)', '9001-32-5 (Fibrinogen)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The remaining seven patients revealed no signs of DIC; nevertheless, four of them showed a moderate increase in D-dimer levels after initiation of therapy.

We conclude from our results that two types of disturbances in fibrinogen metabolism can be observed during vincristine/prednisolone therapy of LBC of CML: (a) a decrease of fibrinogen levels due to a steroid-mediated impairment of liver synthesis, and (b) a rapid fall in fibrinogen levels in the course of DIC, most likely induced by the release of procoagulants from deteriorating blast cells, leading to severe bleeding in selected cases.","['Sunder-Plassmann, G', 'Speiser, W', 'Korninger, C', 'Stain, M', 'Bettelheim, P', 'Pabinger-Fasching, I', 'Lechner, K']","['Sunder-Plassmann G', 'Speiser W', 'Korninger C', 'Stain M', 'Bettelheim P', 'Pabinger-Fasching I', 'Lechner K']","['First Department of Medicine, University of Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antithrombin III/metabolism', 'Blast Crisis/*drug therapy', 'Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation/*drug therapy', 'Female', 'Fibrin Fibrinogen Degradation Products/metabolism', 'Fibrinogen/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Lymphocytes/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Platelet Count', 'Prednisolone/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Thrombin/metabolism', 'Vincristine/*adverse effects/therapeutic use']",1991/05/01 00:00,1991/05/01 00:01,['1991/05/01 00:00'],"['1991/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF01703143 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 1991 May;62(5):169-73. doi: 10.1007/BF01703143.,"['0 (Fibrin Fibrinogen Degradation Products)', '0 (fibrin fragment D)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '9000-94-6 (Antithrombin III)', '9001-32-5 (Fibrinogen)', '9PHQ9Y1OLM (Prednisolone)', 'EC 3.4.21.5 (Thrombin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To investigate the role of these elements, the 5' flanking region of the IL-3 gene was attached to a bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene. The fusion plasmids were analyzed by an in vitro transcription system using Jurkat cell nuclear extract prepared from cells stimulated with phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate and calcium ionophore (PMA/A23187), introduced into Jurkat cells, expressed transiently, and stimulated by co-transfection of human T cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I) encoded transactivator, p40tax. The GC-rich region enhanced TATA-dependent transcription in the in vitro transcription system and also strongly responded to p40tax stimulation in the in vivo cotransfection assay. Using this GC-rich region as a probe, we identified a constitutive DNA-protein complex, alpha, whose binding specificity correlates with transcription activity. However, this element is not sufficient for the expression of the IL-3 gene in response to T cell activation signals (PMA/A23187) and no sequence was found within the IL-3 gene which mediates the response to PMA/A23187.

Human T-cell leukemia/lymphoma virus type I (HTLV-I) is closely associated with ATL; however, 11 (7.5%) of 147 patients with ATL were HTLV-I negative. The cumulative percentage incidence of anti-HTLV-I seropositive ATL patients can be simply described by a Weibull model of the typical tear-off type, suggesting that ATL leukemogenesis may be the result of accumulation of approximately five critical events, most likely somatic mutations within HTLV-I-infected T-cells. ATL is still a difficult disease to treat successfully, while peripheral non-ATL T-lymphoma responded to standard chemotherapy in the same way as B-lymphoma. The disease entity of immunoblastic lymphadenopathy (IBL)-like T-lymphoma was also described. Morphological recognition of focal or sheetlike proliferation of atypical neoplastic pale cells and immunoblasts of T-cell nature were important findings for the diagnosis. Major prognostic factors differed greatly among ATL, peripheral non-ATL T-lymphoma and B-lymphoma. Pathology was not associated with treatment outcome and survival in T-cell diseases. These results indicate that the terms ATL, peripheral non-ATL T-lymphoma, and B-lymphoma should be used instead of the all-inclusive term non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, because of differences in cellular origin, clinical features, treatment outcome, prognosis, prognostic factors, chromosomal aberrations, and etiology.","['Shimoyama, M']",['Shimoyama M'],"['Hematology-Oncology and Medical Oncology Division, National Cancer Center Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Ann Oncol,Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology,9007735,IM,"['Adult', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Japan/epidemiology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/epidemiology/therapy', '*Lymphoma, T-Cell, Peripheral/epidemiology/therapy']",1991/02/01 00:00,1991/02/01 00:01,['1991/02/01 00:00'],"['1991/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/978-1-4899-7305-4_25 [doi]', 'S0923-7534(20)31631-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Oncol. 1991 Feb;2 Suppl 2:157-62. doi: 10.1007/978-1-4899-7305-4_25.,,28,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A multiple logistic regression analysis showed that the increased risk for CD13-positive patients (13.7-fold higher than CD13-negative cases; P = 0.001) of presenting a diffuse pattern of bone marrow infiltration is independent of all other prognostic factors analysed including sex, age, lymphocyte counts, and clinical stage.

In addition, ABMT has been tested in multiple myeloma (MM) and even considered in highly selected cases of chronic myelocytic leukemia (CML). Interest has resulted from the discovery of new purging procedures such as long-term cultures with or without serum-free media containing various lymphokines, the evaluation of cryoinjury on malignant cells, the increased detection of minimal residual disease using PCR, and the acceleration of hemopoietic recovery post-ABMT through the use of peripheral blood stem cells and/or lymphokines. Results presented include data from the international (ABMTR) and European (EBMT) registries, and our own unit in Paris. With respect to acute leukemias, (a) the EBMT listed 1,688 patients. The overall results were as follows: for patients autografted in complete remission (CR) 1, the leukemia-free survival and relapse rate at 7 years were 48 +/- 2% and 41 +/- 3% for AML and 44 +/- 5% and 45 +/- 5% in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), respectively. In CR2, the figures were 34 +/- 4% and 54 +/- 5% for AML and 32 +/- 3% and 62 +/- 4% for ALL, respectively. Patients not relapsing at 1 year post-ABMT had a probability of being cured at 7 years of 86 and 71% if autografted in CR1 and CR2 for AML and 81 and 59% for ALL, respectively. Multivariate analysis of relapse rates in several subpopulations confirmed the efficacy of marrow purging in AML CR1: in patients transplanted prior to January 1988 (minimum follow-up of 2 years), the relapse rate with purged marrow was 35 +/- 5% vs. 47 +/- 3% (p less than 0.005). (b) In Paris, St-Antoine, using TBI and marrow purged with mafosfamide at levels individually adjusted (Blood 1986;67:1367), the probability of remission and DFS were 84 and 62% in AML CR1 63 and 59% in ALL CR1, respectively. There was a statistically significant relationship between the relapse rate and the residual amount of CFUGM progenitors in the marrow after purging. The cutoff point was 0.3%, with a relapse rate of 54% in those receiving marrow containing the higher residual CFUGM fractions and only 29% in those receiving less. With respect to non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, the EBMT listed 698 patients. In intermediate or high grade lymphomas, the DFS at 6 years was 30% and 18% in sensitive and resistant relapses, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Gorin, N C']",['Gorin NC'],"['Department of Hematology, Hopital Saint-Antoine, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Am J Clin Oncol,American journal of clinical oncology,8207754,IM,"['*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Health Surveys', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*surgery', 'Lymphoma/*surgery', 'Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00000421-199112001-00003 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Clin Oncol. 1991;14 Suppl 1:S5-14. doi: 10.1097/00000421-199112001-00003.,,18,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This cytokine stimulates the growth of multipotential progenitor cells and is therefore of clinical interest for the therapy of pancytopenic processes. Both in vitro and animal studies suggest that the development and maturation of multiple lineages of blood cells can best be achieved by combining IL-3 with other growth factors. IL-3 may therefore act to expand a primitive pool of precursor cells, and the presence of additional factors may aid in the differentiation of these cells to functional status. Studies of IL-3 in human beings are in early phase I stages. These trials indicate that this molecule has a short half-life, and hence should be given by routes that permit prolonged serum levels. IL-3 is generally well tolerated, and stimulation of progression to acute leukemia was not observed in our subjects with preleukemic states. This agent increased neutrophil, eosinophil, platelet, and reticulocyte counts in individual patients. However, responses varied from patient to patient, and the IL-3-induced changes in neutrophil counts were modest as opposed to those previously described after GM-CSF therapy. Comparison of the in vitro effects of IL-3 in the colony/culture assay to subsequent in vivo effects in a small number of patients indicates that increases in CFU-G, CFU-M, and CFU-GM can, at times, predict for changes in granulocyte and monocyte counts. A synthesis of currently available data indicates that future trials should be designed to treat additional patients with IL-3 alone and to combine IL-3 with GM-CSF, G-CSF, erythropoietin, and other growth factors.","['Kurzrock, R', 'Estrov, Z', 'Talpaz, M', 'Gutterman, J U']","['Kurzrock R', 'Estrov Z', 'Talpaz M', 'Gutterman JU']","['Department of Clinical Immunology and Biological Therapy, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Am J Clin Oncol,American journal of clinical oncology,8207754,IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Drug Synergism', 'Growth Substances/pharmacology', 'Hematologic Diseases/therapy', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Mast Cells/drug effects', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology']",1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Am J Clin Oncol. 1991;14 Suppl 1:S45-50.,"['0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",27,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study was undertaken to evaluate the effect of alterations in the cellular lipid compositions by clofibrate (CPIB), an antihyperlipidemic agent, on mitoxantrone (Mtn) cytotoxicity in murine P388 leukemia cells sensitive (P388/S) and resistant (P388/Adr) to adriamycin and in human chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cells. CPIB did not elicit any significant alterations in the lipid levels of P388/S cells, whereas in the P388/Adr cells it brought about a 14% and 49% decrease in the levels of cholesterol and triglyceride respectively. Inhibition of 3H-thymidine incorporation was utilized as a measure of cellular cytotoxicity. CPIB caused a dose dependent inhibition of DNA and RNA biosynthesis in P388/S, P388/Adr and CML cells. The combination of CPIB and Mtn induced a greater cytotoxicity in P388/Adr cells as compared to P388/S cells, as shown by enhanced inhibition of 3H-thymidine incorporation in P388/Adr cells. Similar results were observed when 3H-uridine was used as a measure of cellular cytotoxicity. These observations were further confirmed in fresh CML cell samples, in which the combination of CPIB with Mtn induced an irreversible and synergistic inhibition of DNA biosynthesis. Results warrant extensive studies on CPIB as a clinical modulator to enhance the antiproliferative activity of Mtn.","['Parekh, H', 'Chitnis, M']","['Parekh H', 'Chitnis M']","['Cellular Chemotherapy Unit, Tata Memorial Centre, Parel, Bombay, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Tumori,Tumori,0111356,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Clofibrate/*pharmacology', 'DNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Doxorubicin', 'Drug Resistance', 'Humans', 'Leukemia P388/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Membrane Lipids/*chemistry', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Mitoxantrone/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis']",1991/04/30 00:00,1991/04/30 00:01,['1991/04/30 00:00'],"['1991/04/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/04/30 00:01 [medline]', '1991/04/30 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Tumori. 1991 Apr 30;77(2):105-11.,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Membrane Lipids)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'HPN91K7FU3 (Clofibrate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Overall, 46 +/- 5% (95% confidence interval) developed clinical grade II-IV acute GVHD following transplantation. In univariate analysis, patient or donor age greater than or equal to 18 years was significantly associated with increased GVHD risks (greater than or equal to 18, 63 +/- 6% grade II-IV GVHD vs. less than 18, 27 +/- 6%, P less than .0001), without incremental risk in older adults. Univariate analysis showed that donor:recipient sex match and female:female transplants were associated with less-frequent GVHD. More frequent GVHD was associated with chronic myelogenous leukemia, cytomegalovirus seropositivity, and prior donor alloimmunity (pregnancy or transfusion). Additionally, the allele HLA-A26 was associated with increased risk of GVHD (72%, P = .005) while HLA-DR3 was associated with less GVHD (31%, P = .03). Stepwise multivariate analysis confirmed the increased GVHD risks associated with older recipient age, HLA-A26 and donor:recipient gender (not female:female) and the protective effect of HLA-DR3. Similar results were found using the different analytic technique of recursive partition analysis, which identified within the adult population the lowest GVHD risk in female recipients with nonalloimmunized female donors (20%), while other gender combinations had 68% acute GVHD, regardless of donor alloimmunity. In children (less than 18 years), lower GVHD risk accompanied donor:recipient sex-matched (18%) versus mismatched (33%) BMT.

Eighteen patients (eight male) aged 16-49 years underwent dynamic tests of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis with insulin hypoglycaemia, thyrotrophin releasing hormone (TRH) and gonadotrophin releasing hormone stimulation and basal measurement of prolactin, sex steroids and thyroid hormones. Growth hormone responses (mean peak 64 +/- 36 mU/l, range 21-146 mU/l) and cortisol responses (mean peak 831 +/- 122 nmol/l, range 626-1105 nmol/l) were all within the normal range. Two patients had minimally elevated serum prolactin levels (445 and 588 mU/l, normal less than 350 mU/l). Serum thyroxine levels (57-133 nmol/l) were normal but six patients had elevated basal thyrotrophin (TSH) levels (6-9 mU/l) and seven had an exaggerated TSH response to thyrotrophin releasing hormone, indicating radiation-induced damage to the thyroid. Amenorrhea developed within 3 months of irradiation in all females and oestradiol levels were low, at 37-108 pmol/l (mean 58 +/- 22 pmol/l). Severe oligospermia or azoospermia was noted in men tested 5-70 months after irradiation and testicular volume was below the normal adult range in five of seven men assessed. Serum testosterone levels (12.4-35 nmol/l) were normal. Gonadotrophin-releasing hormone-stimulated gonadotrophin levels were elevated in all patients. However, two men have fathered two children each; one has refused semen analysis, but the other has a sperm count of 7 x 10(6)/ml (60 per cent motile, 20 per cent abnormal forms) 70 months after irradiation.

Most of these studies use nuclear shape factors which are based on circumference/surface measurement ratios, such as variations of the nuclear contour index, the form factor, and the nuclear roundness factor. Here we present a new method for the objective evaluation of nuclear shape, involving a simple computer-assisted determination of nuclear area (N) divided by the area of a rectangular figure (F) with sides tangent to the nuclear margin and parallel to the frame of a video monitor. Following calculation of N/F for individual nuclei, our method generates statistical parameters for quantitating nuclear irregularity directly at the population level: the mean N/F ratio; standard deviation; and coefficient of variation. Our use of surface/surface measurement ratios makes our method independent of both magnification and nuclear size. Our method is applied first to normal lymphocytes and neutrophils to manifest the parameters for nuclear irregularity which are generated by our method. The sensitivity of our method is demonstrated using lymphoblasts from patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Our objective ranking of nuclear irregularity for 20 cases of ALL correlates well with the subjective ranking of two pathologists. Because our method scores irregularity on a population basis and independently of other morphological criteria, it is compatible for use with the French-American-British (FAB) classification system (1981) for ALL.","['Wydner, K S', 'Godyn, J J', 'Lee, M L', 'Sciorra, L J']","['Wydner KS', 'Godyn JJ', 'Lee ML', 'Sciorra LJ']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Medicine and Dentistry, New Jersey-Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, New Brunswick.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Mod Pathol,"Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc",8806605,IM,"['Cell Nucleus/*ultrastructure', 'Humans', 'Image Processing, Computer-Assisted/*methods', 'Lymphocytes/pathology/ultrastructure', 'Neutrophils/pathology/ultrastructure', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/classification/pathology']",1991/03/01 00:00,1991/03/01 00:01,['1991/03/01 00:00'],"['1991/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Mod Pathol. 1991 Mar;4(2):154-60.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

K562 cells normally synthesize fetal hemoglobin (gamma-globin), but treatment with tumor-promoting phorbol esters (phorbol myristate acetate and tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate) results in the loss of the erythroid phenotype of the cells and causes a shift toward a megakaryocytic phenotype. This shift involves markedly decreased production of fetal hemoglobin and de novo synthesis of a number of proteins specific for megakaryocytes. The results of this work indicate that negative regulation of fetal hemoglobin during megakaryocytic differentiation of K562 cells occurs at the level of down regulation of gamma-globin mRNA accumulation. This effect consists of at least two components: reduction in the rate of transcription of the gamma-globin gene and decrease in stability of the normally very stable gamma-globin mRNA. We have developed two assay systems that permit investigation of the transcriptional and posttranscriptional effects of phorbol myristate acetate independently from each other. These assay systems make use of a heterologous reporter gene for the transcriptional analysis and a marked gamma-globin gene for the analysis of mRNA stability. The DNA sequences located in the 3' flanking region of the A gamma-globin gene were found to be responsible for the decrease in transcription rate.","['Lumelsky, N L', 'Forget, B G']","['Lumelsky NL', 'Forget BG']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut 06510.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,IM,"['*Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Nucleus/physiology', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Globins/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Megakaryocytes/*cytology', 'Phenotype', 'Plasmids', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Transfection']",1991/07/01 00:00,1991/07/01 00:01,['1991/07/01 00:00'],"['1991/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/mcb.11.7.3528-3536.1991 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1991 Jul;11(7):3528-36. doi: 10.1128/mcb.11.7.3528-3536.1991.,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,,,,PMC361092,,,,,,,,,,,

The comparison with this group was made on the basis of observed/expected distribution. RESULTS: 9 cases of tuberculosis were found, representing a significantly higher frequency than in the general population (observed/expected relation 18.16; p less than 0.000001). In patients with idiopathic myelofibrosis the incidence was clearly higher than in the rest of CMPS. In all patients tuberculosis developed some time after the diagnosis of CMPS. In 4 patients the disease was miliary. In only one of the 5 cases where the microorganisms could be typified it was found to correspond to an atypical mycobacterium.

These findings suggest that it may not be possible to achieve levels of this chelating agent in vivo that are cytotoxic for this disease.","['Blatt, J', 'Boegel, F', 'Hedlund, B E', 'Arena, V C', 'Shadduck, R K']","['Blatt J', 'Boegel F', 'Hedlund BE', 'Arena VC', 'Shadduck RK']","[""Department of Pediatrics, Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh, PA 15213.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,IM,"['Animals', 'Deferoxamine/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Injections, Subcutaneous', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred Strains']",1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0145-2126(91)90015-l [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Res. 1991;15(5):391-4. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(91)90015-l.,['J06Y7MXW4D (Deferoxamine)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The results occurred when other myelogenous markers such as CD11b, CD13 and CD33 were unreactive. Another monoclonal antibody marker of CD14 specificity, MO2, did not demonstrate a similar reactivity. Various other monoclonal antibodies of the same IgGI subclass as MY4 were also not reactive and thereby excludes non-specific adsorption as an explanation of the results. The six patients described in this report represented five non-Hodgkin's lymphoma cases and one chronic lymphocytic leukemia case. Fifteen B-lymphocytic leukemias and 30 other B-lymphocytic non-Hodgkin's lymphomas analysed during the same period were not MY4 positive. In reviewing the clinical course of the six patients compared to the general behavior of these types of malignancies and making a speculative generalization from the small group of cases, the MY4 antigen appeared to be expressed by low to intermediate grade B-lymphocytic malignancies of a type that were more rapidly progressive and/or had a greater tendency to undergo a transformation of their malignancy.

In this trial, we treated 24 patients with recombinant human IL-3 given by a daily 4-hour intravenous infusion for 28 days. The dose levels were 30, 60, 125, 250, 500, 750, and 1,000 micrograms/m2/d. At least three patients were entered at every dose level. Each participant suffered from bone marrow failure, with the underlying diagnosis being myelodysplastic syndrome (13 patients), aplastic anemia (eight patients), or aplasia after prolonged high-dose chemotherapy (three patients) for multiple myeloma, breast cancer, or acute myelogenous leukemia. Most patients tolerated therapy well, with the most frequent side effects being low-grade fever and headaches. Hematopoietic changes included modest increases in neutrophil counts (eight patients), eosinophil counts (six patients), platelet counts (three patients), and reticulocyte counts (two patients). An increase in blasts occurred in one patient who had refractory anemia with excess blasts in transformation and was reversible once IL-3 was discontinued. In addition, one patient with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia showed an increase in monocytes (and granulocytes). Progression to acute leukemia did not occur. Pharmacokinetic analyses showed a rapid clearance with a mean half-life of 18.8 minutes at the 60 micrograms/m2/d dose, and 52.9 minutes at the 250 micrograms/m2/d dose. Serum concentrations of 10 to 20 ng/mL of IL-3 were achievable at the 250 micrograms/m2/d dose. Our observations indicate that recombinant human IL-3 can be given safely at doses of 1,000 micrograms/m2/d or less.

Patients were given toxicity gradings retrospectively in each of eight organ systems (cardiac, bladder, renal, pulmonary, hepatic, CNS, stomatic, and gastrointestinal) according to a recently developed RRT scale. A set of patient, disease, and treatment parameters (age, sex, diagnosis, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group [ECOG] score, preconditioning liver function tests [LFT], prior chemotherapy exposure, disease status, graft-versus-host disease [GVHD] prophylaxis, antimicrobial agent use, hematologic recovery, and severity of acute GVHD) was statistically analyzed to determine significant predictors of RRT. The most common significant organ toxicities were stomatic (87% of patients; 63% grades II to IV) and hepatic (83% of patients; 44% grades II to IV). Renal and gastrointestinal toxicities were not uncommon (35% and 27%, respectively) but were rarely serious (9% and 1% grades II to IV, respectively). Twelve patients developed grade III toxicities of the following systems: hepatic (seven), pulmonary (two), bladder (two), and CNS (one). Females had more frequent stomatitis (P = .04) and hepatic RRT (P = .004). Patients receiving methotrexate in their GVHD prophylactic regimen experienced more grade II to IV stomatitis (P = .04) and hepatic RRT (P = .04). The use of amphotericin B (P = .01) or prolonged antibiotic courses (P = .04) was associated with more grades II to IV hepatic RRT. In a multivariate analysis, only amphotericin B administration predicted grades II to IV hepatic RRT (P = .01). The incidence of acute GVHD was 49%, with 31% having grades II to IV GVHD. The estimated 2-year event-free survival (EFS) for the entire study group was 44%. The estimated 2-year EFS was 63% for standard-risk patients (acute leukemia in first remission and chronic myelogenous leukemia [CML] in first stable phase) and 24% for all others (high-risk patients).

Primary tumor specimens from more than 190 stage II breast cancer patients were evaluated for expression of the high molecular weight antigens. With a median follow-up of 6 years, patients whose tumors exhibited high immunoperoxidase staining scores (greater than 50% positive cells) with MAb DF3 had a superior disease-free survival ([DFS] 56% +/- 6% v 37% +/- 5% at 6 years; P = .0088) and overall survival ([OS] 72% +/- 5% v 59% +/- 5% at 6 years; P = .025). Staining scores with the other two antibodies did not correlate with improved prognosis. For MAbs DF3 and CU18, patients whose tumors exhibited predominantly apical cellular reactivity patterns had improved DFS, although differences reached conventional levels of statistical significance only with MAb CU18. In multivariate analyses, the prognostic value of MAb DF3 staining was independent of other identified prognostic factors. Furthermore, the concordance between primary and axillary lymph node metastases staining with each MAb was 73%, 80%, and 85% for MAbs DF3, F36/22, and CU18, respectively. These results suggest that staining with MAb DF3 identifies a group of node-positive women with a relatively favorable prognosis.

Earlier work to clarify drug metabolism showed that PQ could be converted quantitatively into CPQ, in vitro, with human erythroleukemic K562 cells or nonleukemic bone marrow supplemented with calf serum. We have now found--using systems with serum only, as well as with K562, bone marrow, and adult or embryonic liver cells--that the bioconversion of the side chain of PQ involves a branched pathway with at least three separate enzymes and two derivatives other than CPQ. An oxidase activity in serum converted PQ first into a novel side chain aldehyde (Y). Aldehyde dehydrogenase transformed PQ-aldehyde into CPQ in cell-free systems and in K562, bone marrow, and adult liver cells. Embryonic hepatocytes or bone marrow treated with 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea did not produce CPQ; instead, they made a metabolite (Xc) that we could synthetize via PQ-aldehyde and identify as PQ-alcohol. PQ-alcohol replaced CPQ as the final product whenever alcohol-dehydrogenase prevailed over aldehyde dehydrogenase. These enzymes operated in intact cells and controlled the biotransformation of PQ absolutely. Unless both dehydrogenase were absent, inhibited, or deprived of coenzyme, potentially cytotoxic PQ-aldehyde intermediate did not accumulate. Some of the unique tissues schizonticidal and gametocidal effects of PQ may depend on the distribution pattern and relative activities of PQ oxidase, aldehyde dehydrogenase, and alcohol dehydrogenase in human subjects and in parasites.","['Frischer, H', 'Mellovitz, R L', 'Ahmad, T', 'Nora, M V']","['Frischer H', 'Mellovitz RL', 'Ahmad T', 'Nora MV']","[""Department of Pharmacology, Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke's Medical Center, Chicago, IL 60612.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Lab Clin Med,The Journal of laboratory and clinical medicine,0375375,IM,"['Alcohols/*metabolism', 'Aldehydes/*metabolism', 'Biotransformation', 'Blood/*metabolism', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Carmustine/pharmacology', 'Chromatography', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Embryo, Mammalian/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/metabolism', 'Liver/cytology/embryology/metabolism', 'Primaquine/*analogs & derivatives/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1991/06/01 00:00,1991/06/01 00:01,['1991/06/01 00:00'],"['1991/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Lab Clin Med. 1991 Jun;117(6):468-76.,"['0 (Alcohols)', '0 (Aldehydes)', '77229-68-6 (8-(3-carboxy-1-methylpropylamino)-6-methoxyquinoline)', 'MVR3634GX1 (Primaquine)', 'U68WG3173Y (Carmustine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The density and morphology of CD1a+ cells (i.e., LC) was evaluated by visual assessment as well as automatic image analysis. The density of LC was reduced in seven of nine patients (range, 30-75% of normal), whereas the morphology of LC appeared to be altered in all MDS patients in that the LC displayed large and bizarre cell bodies with only a few and often abnormally long dendrites. The HLA-DR expression by LC was not altered, as shown by double immunofluorescence staining of CD1a and HLA-DR antigens.

The uterus enzyme readily cleaved specific neutral endopeptidase substrates and oxytocin as well as the synthetic elastase substrate, Suc(Ala)3-pNA, yet did not digest native elastin. Using specific inhibitors, the uterus endopeptidase was identified as a metallopeptidase and not a serine protease, having an absolute requirement for zinc and perhaps calcium for maximal activity. The uterus endopeptidase cross-reacted with polyclonal antiserum to kidney microvillar endopeptidase and a monoclonal antibody to common acute lymphocytic leukemia antigen. Immunohistochemical localization of the enzyme in a 17 day pregnant uterus indicated that the enzyme was localized on the smooth muscle bundles of the myometrium and the endometrial epithelium. Total enzyme activity was 25 times higher in the late-term pregnant uterus (17th day of pregnancy) than in the nonpregnant uterus. Enzyme levels dropped rapidly prior to parturition and within 4 days after delivery the enzyme activity had returned to control levels. Inhibition of NEP in uterine strips with phosphoramidon resulted in a marked potentiation of oxytocin-induced contractions. Our results suggest that the uterine endopeptidase may have an important role in regulating uterine smooth muscle cell contraction during the later stages of pregnancy through its action on oxytocin and perhaps other biologically active peptides.","['Ottlecz, A', 'Walker, S', 'Conrad, M', 'Starcher, B']","['Ottlecz A', 'Walker S', 'Conrad M', 'Starcher B']","['Department of Biochemistry, University of Texas Health Center, Tyler 75710.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Fractionation', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Female', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Isoelectric Focusing', 'Kinetics', 'Muscle, Smooth/*enzymology', 'Neprilysin/analysis/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Oxytocin/metabolism', 'Pregnancy', 'Rats', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Uterine Contraction/physiology', 'Uterus/*enzymology']",1991/04/01 00:00,1991/04/01 00:01,['1991/04/01 00:00'],"['1991/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcb.240450414 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 1991 Apr;45(4):401-11. doi: 10.1002/jcb.240450414.,"['50-56-6 (Oxytocin)', 'EC 3.4.24.11 (Neprilysin)']",,,,['HL 34762/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The number of OM cells actually expressing HIV-1 at the beginning of culture was 0%, reached a peak of nearly 100% at 6 weeks, and then fell to less than 10% HIV-1+ cells by 10 weeks. Clonal analysis of the surviving cells verified that stable HIV-1+ OM cells resulted from the spreading infection. Southern analysis confirmed the transmission of HIV-1 through these OM cultures and the occurrence of stable clones which resulted. The initial percentage of OM cells actually harboring the HIV-1 genome was less than 0.1%, indicating nonfaithful transmission of an unintegrated HIV-1 genome during clonal expansion.

Nine individuals with antibodies to 30% or more of the donor panel were entered into the study, but three failed to complete the programme. Comprehensive data are available on the remaining six patients, one of whom was studied twice. The pattern of reactivity to the panel was unaltered, but antibody titres were significantly reduced (P less than 0.006). In one patient, a lymphocytoxic crossmatch performed between the patient and an HLA-haploidentical sibling in the last week of the trial was positive, suggesting that neither procedure was successful in removing an antibody directed against the HLA antigens of a family donor. Three cadaver renal transplants were performed during or after the trial, and while two of the grafts were unsuccessful, one survives at 60 months, with good function. From these data it is concluded that neither cyclosporin A nor its combination with plasma exchange have any effect on the panel reactivity of preformed cytotoxic antibodies, whereas the titres were significantly reduced.

The LI00 cells showed pronounced sensitivity to the RMs verapamil (Ver), cyclosporin A (CsA) and buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) alone as well as to cisplatinum, whereas the L0 and ACHN cells, also slowly growing fibroblasts and non-proliferating lymphocytes, were considerably less sensitive. Compared with AML cells and lymphocytes, CLL cells were more sensitive to Ver and CsA alone. The cytotoxicity of Vcr was significantly increased in the Vcr-resistant ACHN and LI00, but also in sensitive L0 cells by Ver and CsA, with smaller effects on Dox and Vp-16 toxicity. Fibroblasts and lymphocytes were generally resistant to the cytotoxic agents and RM addition had only minor effects. CLL cells were more sensitive to Dox and Vcr as compared with normal lymphocytes, with potentiation of the Vcr effect by Ver and CsA. The Vcr effect in non-proliferating Vcr-resistant cells from a malignant schwannoma was potentiated by Ver and CsA, which had no effect in cells from a kidney adenocarcinoma.

GATA-1 expression is itself restricted to erythroid progenitors and to two related hematopoietic lineages, megakaryocytes and mast cells. During cellular maturation the levels of GATA-1 RNA and protein increase progressively. In an effort to delineate mechanisms by which this pivotal transcription factor is itself regulated we have characterized the mouse GATA-1 gene and cis-elements within its promoter. We find that the isolated promoter retains cell specificity exhibited by the intact gene. Full promoter activity requires the presence of proximal CACCC box sequences and an upstream, double GATA motif that binds a single GATA-1 molecule in an asymmetric fashion. Using in vivo footprinting of mouse erythroleukemic cells we detect protein binding in vivo to both cis-elements. On the basis of these findings we propose that a positive feedback loop mediated through GATA-1 serves two complementary functions: maintenance of the differentiated state by locking the promoter into an ""on"" state, and programming the progressive increase in protein content throughout cellular maturation.","['Tsai, S F', 'Strauss, E', 'Orkin, S H']","['Tsai SF', 'Strauss E', 'Orkin SH']","[""Division of Hematology-Oncology, Children's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Genes Dev,Genes & development,8711660,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Ribonucleases/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1991/06/01 00:00,1991/06/01 00:01,['1991/06/01 00:00'],"['1991/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1101/gad.5.6.919 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Dev. 1991 Jun;5(6):919-31. doi: 10.1101/gad.5.6.919.,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors)', '0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Gata1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 3.1.- (Ribonucleases)']",,['GATA-1'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To determine the transcriptional domain defined by Fli-1, we have isolated a cDNA clone that is highly expressed only in erythroleukemia cell lines with Fli-1 rearrangements. The protein sequence of this cDNA is very similar to Erg2, another member of the ets gene family. The hydrophilic carboxy-terminal end of the Fli-1 cDNA shares significant sequence similarity to the DNA-binding ETS domain found in all members of the ets family. PFGE analysis localized Fli-1 within 240 kb of the ets-1 proto-oncogene on mouse chromosome 9 and human chromosome 11q23, suggesting that ets-1 and Fli-1 arose from a common ancestral gene by gene duplication. The involvement of the murine Fli-1, Spi-1, and avian v-ets genes in erythroleukemia induction suggests that activation of ets gene family members plays an important role in the progression of these multistage malignancies.","['Ben-David, Y', 'Giddens, E B', 'Letwin, K', 'Bernstein, A']","['Ben-David Y', 'Giddens EB', 'Letwin K', 'Bernstein A']","['Division of Molecular and Developmental Biology, Samuel Lunenfeld Research Institute, Mount Sinai Hospital, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Genes Dev,Genes & development,8711660,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Northern', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'DNA/isolation & purification', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Genetic Linkage', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/genetics/*microbiology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Multigene Family', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Protein c-ets-1', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets', 'Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Transcription Factors/genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1991/06/01 00:00,1991/06/01 00:01,['1991/06/01 00:00'],"['1991/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1101/gad.5.6.908 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Dev. 1991 Jun;5(6):908-18. doi: 10.1101/gad.5.6.908.,"['0 (ETS1 protein, human)', '0 (Ets1 protein, mouse)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Protein c-ets-1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",,"['ets', 'ets-1']",,,,,"['GENBANK/M31698', 'GENBANK/M31699', 'GENBANK/M61223', 'GENBANK/M61224', 'GENBANK/M61225', 'GENBANK/X57334', 'GENBANK/X59421', 'GENBANK/X60231', 'GENBANK/X60232', 'GENBANK/X60233']",,,,,,,,,

Here we extend that finding to include measurements of IL-1 beta mRNA and secretion of IL-1 alpha and interleukin-6 (IL-6). As before, a lower production of IL-1 beta was found in cells from progressive disease. IL-6 was produced by cells from patients at all stages, with a tendency to follow the IL-1 beta production. Low secretion of IL-1 alpha was noted. When viable cells were permeabilized and analysed at the single cell level with monoclonal antibodies, most B-CLL cells were found to contain IL-1 alpha. A minor fraction of non-permeabilized cells expressed IL-1 alpha at the cell membrane. However, only small fractions of cells were positive for intracellular IL-1 beta (less than 1%) and almost no IL-6-positive cells were found. We conclude that either IL-1 beta and IL-6 are produced by a minor population of undefined cells, or that a more sensitive in situ method is needed to detect production of these cytokines in B-CLL cells.

Protective host-type cell populations are not induced by IL-2 treatment alone.,29-32,"We have recently demonstrated that high-dose IL-2 administered for a short period (2.5 days) beginning on the day of bone marrow transplantation mediates a marked protective effect against GVHD in mice, while preserving the ability to achieve alloengraftment (1). This protective effect is augmented by administration of T cell-depleted (TCD) syngeneic marrow, and is dependent upon early administration of IL-2 (1). The graft-vs-tumor effect against the EL4 leukemia/lymphoma is not diminished in animals protected from GVHD by IL-2 (2). In an attempt to determine whether or not IL-2-activated host-type cells might be responsible for GVHD protection, we have now performed adoptive transfer studies. The results failed to provide evidence that treatment of lethally irradiated mice with IL-2 activates protective host-derived or syngeneic marrow-derived cell populations which can be adoptively transferred to lethally irradiated secondary recipients receiving allogeneic GVHD-producing inocula. Likewise, treatment of lethally irradiated mice with a complete 2.5-day course of IL-2 prior to administration of allogeneic inocula did not lead to GVHD protection. These results suggest that either IL-2 directly inhibits the GVH reactivity of allogeneic GVH-reactive cells, or that GVH reactivity is attenuated by IL-2 during the period of interaction of donor- and host-type cells.","['Abraham, V S', 'Sykes, M']","['Abraham VS', 'Sykes M']","['Immunology Branch, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects/immunology/*methods', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/immunology/*prevention & control', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Interleukin-2/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred A', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Time Factors', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1991;7 Suppl 1:29-32.,['0 (Interleukin-2)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We studied the biologic properties and the globin synthetic profiles of JCML erythroid cells both in vivo and in vitro from a total of 24 patients.

This growth was by and large erythropoietin-dependent and was not greatly influenced by other added cytokines. By several criteria all erythroid colony growth detected in vitro was derived from JCML progenitors. The globin synthetic profile of JCML erythroid cells showed high levels of fetal hemoglobin both in vivo and in vitro (gamma/gamma + beta: 53% to 94% in reticulocytes, 62% to 98% in BFUe-derived cells). In addition (in seven cases studied) we detected embryonic globins (epsilon and zeta) at the protein and messenger RNA level, a novel finding for primary leukemic cells. We speculate that the transformed erythroid cells in JCML harbor a trans environment supporting expression of developmentally earlier genes (fetal, embryonic). However, in contrast to other acute or subacute leukemias, JCML erythroid cells also have the ability to reach full maturation to the red cell level, thus allowing detection of this primitive program in vivo.","['Papayannopoulou, T', 'Nakamoto, B', 'Anagnou, N P', 'Chui, D', 'Dow, L', 'Sanders, J']","['Papayannopoulou T', 'Nakamoto B', 'Anagnou NP', 'Chui D', 'Dow L', 'Sanders J']","['Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle 98195.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Child, Preschool', 'Erythrocytes/*metabolism/pathology', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'Erythropoietin/pharmacology', 'Globins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Reticulocytes/metabolism']",1991/06/15 00:00,1991/06/15 00:01,['1991/06/15 00:00'],"['1991/06/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/06/15 00:01 [medline]', '1991/06/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)85269-0 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1991 Jun 15;77(12):2569-76.,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)']",,,,['DK 30852/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Interleukin-2 (IL-2) and lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells represent a potentially non-cross-resistant therapeutic modality that might prevent or delay relapses if used early after ABMT at a time when the tumor burden is minimal. However, high-dose chemoradiotherapy and ABMT might increase patients' susceptibility to IL-2 toxicity, and might interfere with immunologic responses to IL-2 in vivo. Therefore, to determine safety, tolerance, and immunomodulatory effects of IL-2 therapy early after ABMT, IL-2 was administered by continuous intravenous infusion to 16 patients 14 to 91 days (median, 33) after ABMT for acute leukemia, lymphoma, or multiple myeloma. Patients were sequentially assigned to escalating IL-2 ""induction"" doses (0.3 to 4.5 x 10(6) U/m2/d, days 1 to 5), and all patients received a nonescalating IL-2 ""maintenance"" dose (0.3 x 10(6) U/m2/d, days 12 to 21). Most patients exhibited mild to moderate fever, nausea, diarrhea, and/or skin rash with IL-2 infusions. The maximum tolerated ""induction"" dose was 3.0 x 10(6) U/m2/d; dose-limiting toxicities were hypotension and thrombocytopenia. All toxicities reversed on stopping the IL-2 infusions, and all patients completed ""maintenance."" Postinfusion lymphocytosis was exhibited by patients at all IL-2 dose levels. With the higher IL-2 doses, increased percentages of patients' PBMC expressed CD16 and CD56, with augmented lysis of K562 and Daudi, reflecting the induction of natural killer and circulating LAK effector activities. Increased LAK precursor activity was exhibited by patients at all IL-2 dose levels. Thus, the IL-2 therapy regimen was safely tolerated after ABMT, and pronounced immunomodulatory effects were observed with the higher IL-2 doses. These studies support the planned use of IL-2 and LAK cells after ABMT in an attempt to reduce relapses of advanced hematologic malignancies.","['Higuchi, C M', 'Thompson, J A', 'Petersen, F B', 'Buckner, C D', 'Fefer, A']","['Higuchi CM', 'Thompson JA', 'Petersen FB', 'Buckner CD', 'Fefer A']","['Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle 98195.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Hodgkin Disease/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Hypotension/chemically induced', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Interleukin-2/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Killer Cells, Lymphokine-Activated/immunology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*therapy', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Lymphocytes/immunology/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/*therapy', 'Thrombocytopenia/chemically induced', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",1991/06/15 00:00,1991/06/15 00:01,['1991/06/15 00:00'],"['1991/06/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/06/15 00:01 [medline]', '1991/06/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)85268-9 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1991 Jun 15;77(12):2561-8.,['0 (Interleukin-2)'],,,,"['CA-18029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P0-1 CA-47748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

FAB classification was not predictive of TdT expression, and there was no difference in the distribution of FAB subtypes between the groups. Multivariate analysis combining clinical and laboratory data indicated that a low expression of the monocytic antigen CD14 was predictive of TdT positivity in AML (P = 0.01). Karyotyping showed no difference in the pattern of occurrence of specific abnormalities between the TdT+ and the TdT- group.

In the present study, we investigated the efficacy of such a defined SF liquid medium which sustained in vitro residual normal haemopoietic proliferation of marrow derived from ALL patients and which was detrimental for the leukaemic population. Evidence for a potential selective effect of SF culture was obtained by a leukaemic progenitor cell assay (ALL-CFU) and the detection of the bcr/abl translocation by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In 13 experiments including 12 patients, morphological blast cells and ALL-CFU were dramatically reduced within 3 weeks of incubation in both SF and SD cultures. Likewise, in 5/5 experiments in SD and 2/5 experiments in SF conditions, leukaemic cells expressing the bcr/abl fusion gene disappeared within 3-4 weeks. In contrast, the absolute numbers of supernatant cells harvested weekly from SF and SD cultures were similar. No difference in CFU-GM production was detected for the two culture systems.

Thirty-eight of the 153 patients (25%) showed progression to ANLL, 63 (41%) died during the myelodysplastic phase due to infection or bleeding and three (2%) received allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Univariate analysis showed that the FAB-classification, in vitro growth pattern and differentiation, and cytogenetics had a predictive value for ANLL development and survival. The Bournemouth score was predictive only for survival. Most predictive for the development of ANLL were in vitro growth pattern and maturation. Patients with normal in vitro growth progressed to ANLL in 6% of the cases, in patients with hypoplastic or leukaemic growth 32.5% developed ANLL (P less than 0.0001). The ANLL incidence in patients with normally differentiated in vitro colonies was 14.5%, compared with a 52% incidence in cases showing no in vitro cell maturation (P = 0.001). The combination of growth pattern and differentiation revealed an ANLL incidence of 4.2% in cases of normal growth and differentiation, and 60.4% if the in vitro growth and/or differentiation was abnormal (P = 0.006). In vitro maturation was the only parameter predictive for ANLL development in multivariate analysis. From our data it is concluded that the predictive value of in vitro bone marrow culturing in patients with MDS can be increased by including in vitro maturation as a distinct parameter. The in vitro prognostic data can be important in selecting MDS patients for intensive chemotherapy or BMT.","['Raymakers, R', 'De Witte, T', 'Joziasse, J', 'Van der Lely, N', 'Boezeman, J', 'Haanen, C']","['Raymakers R', 'De Witte T', 'Joziasse J', 'Van der Lely N', 'Boezeman J', 'Haanen C']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospital Nijmegen, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Bone Marrow/*growth & development/pathology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/classification/genetics/*pathology', 'Male', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/genetics/*pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Factors']",1991/05/01 00:00,1991/05/01 00:01,['1991/05/01 00:00'],"['1991/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1991.tb04379.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1991 May;78(1):35-41. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1991.tb04379.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is not so in adults with AML in first remission where more intensive therapy does not reduce the likelihood of relapse. Furthermore, leukaemia relapse because of re-infused leukaemia cells is an important issue in autotransplants for ALL. Whether re-infusing leukaemia cells would be important in AML were more effective pretransplant therapy developed is unknown. Presently, there appears to be little sense to test in vitro approaches to remove leukaemia cells in autotransplants for AML because efficacy cannot be evaluated. (A randomized trial is an exception but would not be expected to show a difference.) Another conclusion is that attempts to induce GVHD in autotransplant recipients, such as by using cyclosporine post-transplant (Jones et al, 1989), are more likely to succeed in AML than ALL since the impact of GVHD is substantially greater (Horowitz et al, 1990). However, the GVHD-related antileukaemia effect in AML is associated with chronic GVHD whereas cyclosporine treatment of autotransplant recipients results in acute GVHD. Also, attempts to separate clinical and antileukaemia effects of GVHD were unsuccessful (Sullivan et al, 1989). Another caution is that in AML we detected an immune antileukaemia effect distinct from GVHD (termed GVL) only after HLA-identical sibling transplants. Since GVL was absent in twins it is unlikely to operate after autotransplants. In summary, there is sense in studying autotransplants in adults with acute leukaemia in first remission. However, there are currently no convincing data that autotransplants are superior to current therapy. More intensive treatment seems effective in ALL; the focus should be on increasing the antileukaemia efficacy of pretransplant therapy and on attempts to remove leukaemia cells from the graft. In AML, there is no evidence that more intensive therapy is more effective. This problem needs resolution before evaluating attempts to remove leukaemia cells from the graft. The best place to test new pretransplant regimens is in twins and recipients of HLA-identical sibling transplants without GVHD. The data and ideas we review and discuss should be useful in planning clinical trials.","['Gale, R P', 'Horowitz, M M', 'Butturini, A']","['Gale RP', 'Horowitz MM', 'Butturini A']","['Department of Medicine, UCLA School of Medicine 90024-1678.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*surgery', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*surgery', '*Transplantation, Autologous']",1991/05/01 00:00,1991/05/01 00:01,['1991/05/01 00:00'],"['1991/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1991.tb04401.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1991 May;78(1):135-7. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1991.tb04401.x.,,21,,,['CA 23175/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Affinity-purified CML-PMN-LF was found to be qualitatively deficient as a suppressor of the release of colony-stimulating factors from mononuclear blood cells, adding to previous information from our group documenting defective LF-cell interactions in CML. LF was detected by immunoradiometric assay in PMN of the patient with LF deficiency, but at a much lower level than normal.

Decreased LF levels in this patient were associated with increased levels of monocyte H-ferritin inhibitory activity, consistent with the known suppressive effects in vitro of LF on H-ferritin release from monocytes.

The accumulation of phosphatidic acid (PA) or phosphatidylethanol (PEt) in the presence of ethanol was paralleled by the second-phase DG generation. Ag-induced formation of phosphocholine and choline in [3H]choline-labeled cells suggested the hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine (PC) by phospholipases C and D. Treatment with phorbol myristate (PMA) or A23187 caused increases in [3H]DG and water-soluble [3H]choline metabolites. In protein kinase C (PKC) down-regulated cells, PEt formation was markedly reduced. In these cells DG production induced by Ag and A23187 was largely suppressed, thus indicating that PKC would play an important regulatory role for PC hydrolysis. However, because the A23187 treatment showed significant accumulation of water-soluble choline metabolites in PKC down-regulated cells, an increase in intracellular Ca2+ is another factor regulating PC hydrolysis. Taken together, these results may indicate that PC hydrolysis in response to Ag is dependent on PKC and Ca2+.","['Nakashima, S', 'Fujimiya, H', 'Miyata, H', 'Nozawa, Y']","['Nakashima S', 'Fujimiya H', 'Miyata H', 'Nozawa Y']","['Department of Biochemistry, Gifu University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,IM,"['Animals', '*Antigens', 'Calcimycin/pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Choline/metabolism', 'Diglycerides/*metabolism', 'Hydrolysis', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute', 'Myristic Acid', 'Myristic Acids/metabolism', 'Phosphatidylcholines/*metabolism', 'Phospholipase D/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase C/*metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Type C Phospholipases/metabolism']",1991/05/31 00:00,1991/05/31 00:01,['1991/05/31 00:00'],"['1991/05/31 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/05/31 00:01 [medline]', '1991/05/31 00:00 [entrez]']","['0006-291X(91)91988-O [pii]', '10.1016/0006-291x(91)91988-o [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 1991 May 31;177(1):336-42. doi: 10.1016/0006-291x(91)91988-o.,"['0 (Antigens)', '0 (Diglycerides)', '0 (Myristic Acids)', '0 (Phosphatidylcholines)', '0I3V7S25AW (Myristic Acid)', '37H9VM9WZL (Calcimycin)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 3.1.4.- (Type C Phospholipases)', 'EC 3.1.4.4 (Phospholipase D)', 'N91BDP6H0X (Choline)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We evaluated 12 long-term survivors of childhood leukemia using [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography, computed tomography scans, clinical neurological examinations, and neuropsychological tests. Regional cerebral metabolic rate for glucose (rCMRGlc) values for white matter were lower in the older long-term survivors (greater than 18 years old) treated with cranial radiation and intrathecal chemotherapy than in normal control subjects or survivors who had been treated with intrathecal chemotherapy alone. The ratio of white matter: cortex rCMRGlc values was lower than control values in the long-term survivors treated with cranial radiation and intrathecal chemotherapy, regardless of age, but not in those treated with intrathecal chemotherapy alone. By contrast, thalamic rCMRGlc values were lower than control values in older survivors regardless of treatment, and the ratio for thalamus:cortex rCMRGlc values was lower in all the treatment groups than in the control subjects. The highest rCMRGlc values were found in the youngest children, indicating an important effect of age on cerebral glucose metabolism. No neuropsychological deficits were identified in patients treated only with intrathecal chemotherapy; however, lower IQ scores were found in the long-term survivors who had been treated with cranial radiation and intrathecal chemotherapy. Treatment of the central nervous system with cranial radiation and intrathecal chemotherapy may cause prolonged alterations in white-matter and thalamic rCMRGlc, which may permit the identification and assessment of neurotoxicity in long-term survivors of acute lymphocytic leukemia by [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography.","['Phillips, P C', 'Moeller, J R', 'Sidtis, J J', 'Dhawan, V', 'Steinherz, P G', 'Strother, S C', 'Ginos, J Z', 'Rottenberg, D A']","['Phillips PC', 'Moeller JR', 'Sidtis JJ', 'Dhawan V', 'Steinherz PG', 'Strother SC', 'Ginos JZ', 'Rottenberg DA']","['Department of Neurology, Johns Hopkins Hospital, Baltimore, MD 21205.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Ann Neurol,Annals of neurology,7707449,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Brain/diagnostic imaging/*metabolism', 'Brain Neoplasms/diagnostic imaging/metabolism/*prevention & control', 'Cerebrovascular Circulation/*physiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Glucose/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnostic imaging/metabolism/*therapy', 'Time Factors', 'Tomography, Emission-Computed']",1991/03/01 00:00,1991/03/01 00:01,['1991/03/01 00:00'],"['1991/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ana.410290306 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Neurol. 1991 Mar;29(3):263-71. doi: 10.1002/ana.410290306.,['IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 1977 and 1988, 130 patients underwent 158 intensive treatment episodes to control acute leukemia, lymphoma, and aplastic anemia, and the frequency of complicating aspergillus infection was determined. RESULTS: Proven invasive aspergillus infections occurred in 22 cases, 12 of which were fatal. Invasive aspergillosis was suspected in a further 16 cases and all these patients recovered with amphotericin B treatment. Colonization by Aspergillus in the absence of clinically significant infection was seen in 31 treatment episodes. Invasive aspergillosis involved mainly the upper and lower respiratory tract and skin. Control of the infection was closely related to the control of the underlying disease, with subsequent return of normal marrow function and resolution of neutropenia. The incidence of aspergillus infection has decreased dramatically since 1985, most probably due to the introduction of intranasal amphotericin B. This occurred despite the persistence of aspergillus spores in the hematology ward air during the 1986 to 1988 period. CONCLUSION: Intranasal aerosolized amphotericin B may protect against invasive aspergillosis, even when neutropenic patients are cared for in conventional wards without HEPA filtration.","['Jeffery, G M', 'Beard, M E', 'Ikram, R B', 'Chua, J', 'Allen, J R', 'Heaton, D C', 'Hart, D N', 'Schousboe, M I']","['Jeffery GM', 'Beard ME', 'Ikram RB', 'Chua J', 'Allen JR', 'Heaton DC', 'Hart DN', 'Schousboe MI']","['Department of Haematology, Christchurch Hospital, New Zealand.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Med,The American journal of medicine,0267200,IM,"['Administration, Intranasal', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Air Microbiology', 'Amphotericin B/*administration & dosage', 'Aspergillosis/etiology/microbiology/*prevention & control', 'Child, Preschool', 'Environmental Monitoring', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/complications/surgery', 'Lung Diseases, Fungal/etiology/microbiology/*prevention & control', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nasal Mucosa/microbiology', 'Neutropenia/*complications', 'Retrospective Studies']",1991/06/01 00:00,1991/06/01 00:01,['1991/06/01 00:00'],"['1991/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['0002-9343(91)90663-I [pii]'],ppublish,Am J Med. 1991 Jun;90(6):685-92.,['7XU7A7DROE (Amphotericin B)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) was the most common underlying disease in patients with candidemia, risk factors for candidemia were analyzed in this subset of patients. A case-control study comparing the eight ALL patients who had candidemia with 18 ALL control patients revealed that previous bacteremia, prolonged neutropenia, prolonged fever, prolonged administration of antimicrobial agents, treatment with multiple antimicrobial agents, and a relatively high concentration of Candida organisms in stool were significant risk factors for candidemia. In a logistic regression analysis, however, only receipt of vancomycin and/or imipenem was identified as an independent risk factor for candidemia. Further analysis showed that administration of vancomycin promoted proliferation of Candida organisms in the gastrointestinal tract and that this proliferation was associated with an increased risk of candidemia.","['Richet, H M', 'Andremont, A', 'Tancrede, C', 'Pico, J L', 'Jarvis, W R']","['Richet HM', 'Andremont A', 'Tancrede C', 'Pico JL', 'Jarvis WR']","['Hospital Infections Program, Center for Infectious Diseases, Centers for Disease Control, Atlanta, Georgia 30333.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Rev Infect Dis,Reviews of infectious diseases,7905878,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Anti-Infective Agents/therapeutic use', 'Candida/drug effects/growth & development', 'Candidiasis/blood/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Digestive System/microbiology', 'Feces/microbiology', 'Female', 'Fever/complications', 'Humans', 'Imipenem/therapeutic use', 'Male', 'Neutropenia/complications', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications', 'Regression Analysis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Sepsis/complications', 'Vancomycin/pharmacology/therapeutic use']",1991/03/01 00:00,1991/03/01 00:01,['1991/03/01 00:00'],"['1991/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/clinids/13.2.211 [doi]'],ppublish,Rev Infect Dis. 1991 Mar-Apr;13(2):211-5. doi: 10.1093/clinids/13.2.211.,"['0 (Anti-Infective Agents)', '6Q205EH1VU (Vancomycin)', '71OTZ9ZE0A (Imipenem)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Blast cells were isolated from peripheral blood or bone marrow before induction therapy using Ficoll density gradient. GST activity was measured according to the spectrophotometric assay based on the use of 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene as a substrate. The results did not show any significant differences between activities of the enzyme within the different leukemia types according to the French-American-British (FAB) classification. The patients who achieved complete remission demonstrated the lowest value of enzyme activity. The highest enzyme activity was observed in those patients who achieved partial remission and the non-responsive patients presented a GST value within the median of these two groups. Two categories of patients were represented within the non-responsive treatment group. One was resistant to the conventional therapy and in the other death was caused by infectious or hemorrhagic complications. The mean GST activity in these two groups of patients differ greatly. These results suggest that low GST activity of leukemic cells could be a favourable prognostic factor whereas high GST values could help to find out the group of patients who should be further analysed prior to induction therapy.","['Koberda, J', 'Hellmann, A']","['Koberda J', 'Hellmann A']","['III Department of Medicine, Medical School, Gdansk, Poland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Med Oncol Tumor Pharmacother,Medical oncology and tumor pharmacotherapy,8405039,IM,"['Bone Marrow/enzymology', 'Daunorubicin/therapeutic use', 'Doxorubicin/therapeutic use', 'Glutathione Transferase/*blood/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/drug therapy/*enzymology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*enzymology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*enzymology', 'Prognosis']",1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF02988569 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Oncol Tumor Pharmacother. 1991;8(1):35-8. doi: 10.1007/BF02988569.,"['80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In late January 1985, he noticed swelling of the bilateral inguinal lymph-nodes followed by fever and lumbago. In February, he consulted a local doctor and hepatosplenomegaly, marked leukocytosis and renal dysfunction were pointed out and he was referred to our hospital on February 22nd. The clinical laboratory data on admission were as follows; WBC 23,200/microliter, serum-Ca 18.4 mg/dl, BUN 85.3 mg/dl, creatinine 5.4 mg/dl, antibody to ATLV x160. ATL was diagnosed by biopsy of lymph nodes and examinations of peripheral blood and bone marrow hemogram. Remission was achieved in March by the treatment with adriacin. Renal failure and hypercalcemia also improved. However his respiratory dysfunction gradually worsened. The chest radiographies++ showed pulmonary edema, although there was no clinical evidence of heart failure. When his condition became stable, TBLB was performed and revealed extensive deposition of calcium along alveolar septae, suggesting that pulmonary edema was induced by the metastatic calcification of the lung. After the second treatment for ATL, he died of pneumonia. The autopsy showed calcium deposition not only in the lung but in pyramids of the kidney and in sub-serous layer of the small intestine. There was no tumor cell invasion into the bone or parathyroid gland. High urinary c-AMP together with normal levels of PTH suggested that the hypercalcemia in this case was induced by PTH-related protein. It was concluded that careful treatment for hypercalcemia is important as regards the occurrence of pulmonary edema.","['Sasaki, I', 'Morimoto, K', 'Koya, Y', 'Mutoh, T', 'Hagiwara, T', 'Hosokawa, Y', 'Yamaguchi, M', 'Sawada, U', 'Horie, T']","['Sasaki I', 'Morimoto K', 'Koya Y', 'Mutoh T', 'Hagiwara T', 'Hosokawa Y', 'Yamaguchi M', 'Sawada U', 'Horie T']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, School of Medicine, Nihon University.']",['jpn'],"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Nihon Kyobu Shikkan Gakkai Zasshi,Nihon Kyobu Shikkan Gakkai zasshi,7505737,IM,"['Calcinosis/*etiology/pathology', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Humans', 'Hypercalcemia/etiology/pathology', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*complications/pathology', 'Lung/pathology', 'Lung Diseases/*etiology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Nihon Kyobu Shikkan Gakkai Zasshi. 1991 Jan;29(1):105-10.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We demonstrate for the first time that human peripheral blood monocytes are susceptible to Pichinde virus infection, as shown by immunoprecipatation of virus-specific polypeptides from infected cells, immunofluorescence analyses, and quantitation of virus production from infected cells. The human promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL60 did not support Pichinde virus replication, even if cells were induced with the phorbol ester phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) to differentiate to monocytes. However, the human promonocytic leukemia cell line THP-1 did support Pichinde virus replication. Replication depended on exposure of the cells to PMA. We examined the nature of the effect of PMA in the induction of THP-1 cells to support Pichinde virus replication. We found that 5 min of exposure of THP-1 cells to PMA is sufficient to support virus growth and that PMA-treated THP-1 cells remain susceptible to infection up to 4 days after the initial PMA treatment. We also showed that infection of PMA-treated THP-1 cells is mediated through protein kinase C (PKC). H7, a PKC inhibitor, was able to block both PMA-induced differentiation and Pichinde virus infection of THP-1 cells. The synthetic diacylglycerol and PKC agonist, diC8, was able to stimulate THP-1 cells to support virus growth, albeit to lower levels than PMA. Dactinomycin abrogated the ability of virus to replicate and suggested a requirement for host cell transcription. The PMA effect did not appear to relate to receptor modulation. These results suggest that PMA-induced susceptibility to Pichinde virus infection occurs at a point later than the initial binding and penetration stages and that infection depends on the activation or differentiation state of the cell.","['Polyak, S J', 'Rawls, W E', 'Harnish, D G']","['Polyak SJ', 'Rawls WE', 'Harnish DG']","['Department of Pathology, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['1-(5-Isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-Methylpiperazine', 'Antigens, Viral/analysis', 'Arenaviridae/*growth & development/immunology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Diglycerides/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Isoquinolines/pharmacology', 'Monocytes/cytology/*microbiology', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Receptors, Virus/metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Viral Proteins/biosynthesis', '*Virus Replication']",1991/07/01 00:00,1991/07/01 00:01,['1991/07/01 00:00'],"['1991/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.65.7.3575-3582.1991 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1991 Jul;65(7):3575-82. doi: 10.1128/JVI.65.7.3575-3582.1991.,"['0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (Diglycerides)', '0 (Isoquinolines)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '1069-87-0 (1,2-dioctanoylglycerol)', '84477-87-2 (1-(5-Isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-Methylpiperazine)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,,,,PMC241357,,,,,,,,,,,

The most common genetic change found in the evolution of typical Ph1 chromosome positive CML to blast crisis was an alteration of the p53 gene involving either a rearrangement, a deletion, or a point mutation in the coding sequence of the gene. Alterations of the p53 gene were found in the myeloid and the rare megakaryocytic variant of blast crisis but were absent in the lymphoid leukemic transformants. Gross structural alterations were seen in 11 of 54 (20%) of myeloid or unknown phenotypes of blast crisis and in only 1 of 44 chronic phase cases. Eight examples of mutations in the open reading frame of the p53 gene at codons 49, 53, 60, 140, 202, 204, 238, and 239 were observed in blast crisis patients. Mutations in the N-RAS gene were rare in typical blast crisis (2 of 27 cases) but were found in megakaryocytic and Ph1 negative myeloid blast crisis. We concluded that heterogeneous alterations in the p53 gene and occasionally in the N-RAS genes accompany the evolution of chronic phase CML to blast crisis.","['Ahuja, H', 'Bar-Eli, M', 'Arlin, Z', 'Advani, S', 'Allen, S L', 'Goldman, J', 'Snyder, D', 'Foti, A', 'Cline, M']","['Ahuja H', 'Bar-Eli M', 'Arlin Z', 'Advani S', 'Allen SL', 'Goldman J', 'Snyder D', 'Foti A', 'Cline M']",['UCLA Department of Medicine 90024.'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,IM,"['Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Southern', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Accelerated Phase/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/genetics', 'Mutation', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras)/genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics']",1991/06/01 00:00,1991/06/01 00:01,['1991/06/01 00:00'],"['1991/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1172/JCI115234 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Invest. 1991 Jun;87(6):2042-7. doi: 10.1172/JCI115234.,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (HRAS protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras))']",,,,['CA-50275/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC296960,,,,,,,,,,,

In either case, these rearrangements provide useful clonal markers for the leukemias in question. In the t(1;14)(p34;q11) translocation associated with T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), the breakpoints on chromosome 1 interrupt the tal-1 gene. A site-specific deletion interrupts the same gene in an additional 26% of T-ALL. Thus, nearly one-third of these leukemias contain clustered rearrangements of the tal-1 locus. To test whether these rearrangements can serve as markers for residual disease, we monitored four patients with T-ALL; three of the leukemias contained a deleted (tald) and one a translocated (talt) tal-1 allele. These alleles were recognized by a sensitive amplification/hybridization assay. tald alleles were found in the blood of one patient during the 4th mo of treatment but not thereafter. Using a quantitative assay to measure the fraction of tald alleles in DNA extracts, we estimated that this month 4 sample contained 150 tald copies per 10(6) genome copies. The patient with t(1;14)(p34;q11) (talt) leukemia developed a positive assay during the 20th mo of treatment. By standard criteria, all four patients remain in complete remission 11-20 mo into treatment.

We have previously reported the identification of a novel integrin beta subunit partial cDNA from leukocytes. We have now determined the complete sequence of this subunit, designated as beta 7, from overlapping clones obtained from a PEER T leukemia cell library and a peripheral T cell library. The beta 7 cDNA contains a single large open reading frame predicted to encode a 798-amino acid protein precursor (signal peptide plus mature protein). The beta 7 protein, like the other beta subunit proteins, is predicted to contain a large extracellular portion, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic tail. The deduced beta 7 amino acid sequence is 32-46% identical to the six previously sequenced human integrin beta subunits. beta 7 is most similar to the leukocyte integrin common beta subunit (beta 2, CD18). Analysis of variant beta 7 cDNA clones and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction products suggest that alternatively spliced beta 7 mRNAs can be generated by the removal of exons that encode most of the cysteine-rich region of the extracellular portion of beta 7. By Northern blot analysis, beta 7 mRNA was detected in T and B cell lines and in macrophage-like cell lines, but not in any of the nonleukocyte cell lines tested. Peripheral T cells and some lymphoma lines express little beta 7 mRNA before stimulation; but after stimulation with phorbol ester, beta 7 mRNA levels increased markedly. Integrin beta 7 is expected to play a role in adhesive interactions of leukocytes.","['Erle, D J', 'Ruegg, C', 'Sheppard, D', 'Pytela, R']","['Erle DJ', 'Ruegg C', 'Sheppard D', 'Pytela R']","['Lung Biology Center, University of California, San Francisco 94143.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA Probes', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Gene Library', 'Humans', 'Integrins/*genetics/isolation & purification', 'Leukemia, T-Cell', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligonucleotide Probes', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'T-Lymphocytes']",1991/06/15 00:00,1991/06/15 00:01,['1991/06/15 00:00'],"['1991/06/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/06/15 00:01 [medline]', '1991/06/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(18)99120-9 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1991 Jun 15;266(17):11009-16.,"['0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Integrins)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Oligonucleotide Probes)']",,,,"['HL/AI33259/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL19155/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,"['GENBANK/M62880', 'GENBANK/M63255', 'GENBANK/M63806', 'GENBANK/M64332', 'GENBANK/M84122', 'GENBANK/M84123', 'GENBANK/M84124', 'GENBANK/M84125', 'GENBANK/M84128', 'GENBANK/S69830']",,,,,,,,,

We have developed a simple non-invasive technique for measuring the permeability surface area (PS) product, which is suitable for clinical use. We illustrate its potential value in six subjects who underwent bone marrow transplantation for chronic myeloid leukaemia. These patients received high-dose cyclosporin A (CyA) for prevention of graft versus host disease (GVHD) and sustained an easily measurable increase in microvascular permeability to technetium 99m diethyltriamine penta-acetic acid (99mTc-DTPA). This was measured as the PS product, which increased from 1.1 (SD 0.3) to 2.2 (0.4) ml/min per 100 ml tissue between baseline and treatment with CyA for prevention of GVHD (P less than 0.01). The increase broadly correlated with nephrotoxicity which was measured, from the plasma DTPA clearance, as global glomerular filtration rate (GFR). This decreased from 106 (11.1) to 49 (6.7) ml/min (P less than 0.001). These abnormalities, both in PS product and GFR, were sustained for several months, after which they tended to return towards baseline levels. We conclude firstly that this technique has a potential clinical role and secondly that endothelial abnormalities due to CyA deserve further study.","['Peters, A M', 'Vassilarou, D S', 'Hows, J M', 'Ballardie, F W']","['Peters AM', 'Vassilarou DS', 'Hows JM', 'Ballardie FW']","['Department of Diagnostic Radiology, Royal Postgraduate Medical School, London, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Eur J Nucl Med,European journal of nuclear medicine,7606882,IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Capillary Permeability/*drug effects/physiology', 'Cyclosporins/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Kidney/*drug effects', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diagnostic imaging/*therapy', 'Male', 'Radionuclide Imaging', '*Technetium Tc 99m Pentetate']",1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF02262731 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Nucl Med. 1991;18(3):199-202. doi: 10.1007/BF02262731.,"['0 (Cyclosporins)', 'VW78417PU1 (Technetium Tc 99m Pentetate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The addition of methylprednisolone significantly reduced the occurrence of nausea (p = 0.003) and emesis (P = 0.06). Moreover, antiemetic rescue with chlorpromazine was less frequently necessary in patients receiving corticosteroids (P = 0.02).

Previous studies from our laboratory have shown that DDATHF is an effective inducer of the maturation of HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia. In solution, DDATHF is a mixture of two diastereomers due to an asymmetric configuration at carbon 6. Incubation of HL-60 cells with 1 microM of each diastereomer resulted in an inhibition of cellular proliferation after 48 h that preceded an increase in the number of differentiated myeloid cells, as determined by the ability of cells to reduce nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) and by the binding of the myeloid-specific antibody Mo 1. Several analogs of DDATHF were also tested as inducers of the differentiation of HL-60 cells. With the exception of the 10-acetyl analog of 5-deazatetrahydrofolic acid, all compounds displayed similar activities as inducers of maturation. The finding that both stereoisomers of DDATHF, as well as the analogs tested, could selectively reduce intracellular purine nucleotide levels suggested that these compounds inhibited purine nucleotide biosynthesis de novo. This possibility was confirmed by the finding that hypoxanthine completely prevented the reduction of intracellular purine nucleotide levels, as well as the induction of differentiation and the inhibition of cellular growth, by these folate analogs. The results suggest that GAR transformylase is a target for a series of compounds whose structures resemble that of tetrahydrofolate and indicate that the inhibition of GAR transformylase by these compounds is sufficient to induce the maturation of HL-60 leukemia cells.","['Sokoloski, J A', 'Beardsley, G P', 'Sartorelli, A C']","['Sokoloski JA', 'Beardsley GP', 'Sartorelli AC']","['Department of Pharmacology, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT 06510.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,IM,"['Acyltransferases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Folic Acid Antagonists/*pharmacology', 'Humans', '*Hydroxymethyl and Formyl Transferases', 'Hypoxanthine', 'Hypoxanthines/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/metabolism/*pathology', 'Macrophage-1 Antigen/metabolism', 'Nitroblue Tetrazolium/metabolism', 'Phosphoribosylglycinamide Formyltransferase', 'Purine Nucleotides/*biosynthesis', 'Stereoisomerism', 'Tetrahydrofolates/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism']",1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00684954 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 1991;28(1):39-44. doi: 10.1007/BF00684954.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Folic Acid Antagonists)', '0 (Hypoxanthines)', '0 (Macrophage-1 Antigen)', '0 (Purine Nucleotides)', '0 (Tetrahydrofolates)', '298-83-9 (Nitroblue Tetrazolium)', '2TN51YD919 (Hypoxanthine)', '6P3AVY8A7Q (lometrexol)', 'EC 2.1.2.- (Hydroxymethyl and Formyl Transferases)', 'EC 2.1.2.2 (Phosphoribosylglycinamide Formyltransferase)', 'EC 2.3.- (Acyltransferases)']",,,,"['CA-02817/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-16359/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

The dosage range explored was 80 to 2160 mg/m2/day for 5 days by continuous i.v. infusion. The drug levels in plasma and urine were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography with postcolumn derivatization and fluorescence detection. One drug metabolite was demonstrated in plasma and urine of treated patients. This metabolite was extracted from urine and purified to homogeneity; thereafter, it was examined by high-performance liquid chromatography, nuclear magnetic resonance, and fragmentation mass spectrometry and was demonstrated to be identical to chemically synthesized desaminopropyl-DSG. The mean steady state plasma concentrations of DSG ranged from 0.28 to 11.1 microM at, respectively, the 80- and 2160-mg/m2 dosage levels. The plasma concentration at steady state and the area under the plasma concentration versus time curve of DSG were proportional to dose (r = 0.97). Following discontinuance of the infusion, DSG was cleared from the plasma in a biexponential fashion. The mean total body clearance was 364 +/- 78 ml/min/m2. Desaminopropyl-DSG was formed extensively at all dosage levels; mean steady state plasma levels of this metabolite reached a plateau 2.65 microM at a dose of 720 mg/m2/day and did not rise with further dose increments. The urinary content of DSG was examined in 20 patients over the dosage range from 160 to 960 mg/m2/day; in this group less than 10% of the administered dose was excreted as DSG. In four patients at the 720- and 960-mg/m2/day dosage levels, the total DSG plus metabolite excretion ranged from 7 to 18% of the administered dose, with comparable quantities occurring as the parent drug and desaminopropyl-DSG.","['Muindi, J F', 'Lee, S J', 'Baltzer, L', 'Jakubowski, A', 'Scher, H I', 'Sprancmanis, L A', 'Riley, C M', 'Vander Velde, D', 'Young, C W']","['Muindi JF', 'Lee SJ', 'Baltzer L', 'Jakubowski A', 'Scher HI', 'Sprancmanis LA', 'Riley CM', 'Vander Velde D', 'Young CW']","['Clinical Pharmacology Laboratory, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York 10021.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacokinetics', 'Biotransformation', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Drug Evaluation', 'Guanidines/administration & dosage/metabolism/*pharmacokinetics/toxicity', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Leukemia P388', 'Metabolic Clearance Rate', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms/blood/*drug therapy/urine']",1991/06/15 00:00,1991/06/15 00:01,['1991/06/15 00:00'],"['1991/06/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/06/15 00:01 [medline]', '1991/06/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1991 Jun 15;51(12):3096-101.,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Guanidines)', 'UJ0ZJ76DO9 (gusperimus)']",,,,"['CA 05826/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 08748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-CM-57732/CM/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

For chronic leukaemias of lymphoid lineage, three new chemical agents, all purine analogues, seem to be of particular interest. Pentostatin is a specific inhibitor of ADA and has been shown to be highly efficient in producing CR in patients with HCL. Its relative merit compared with IFN-alpha for the treatment of HCL is being studied in ongoing randomized trials. Pentostatin is also active in B-CLL and promising activities have been demonstrated in T- or B-PLL and ATCL. Fludarabine is an analogue of adenine which is resistant to the deamination of ADA. It has been reported to be highly active for patients with both pretreated or non-treated B-CLL. CR rates of 13% with overall response rates of 57% can be achieved, even in heavily pretreated patients. Its activity in the other lymphoid malignancies is not yet known. CdA, a substrate analogue of ADA, has also produced encouraging results in B-CLL, HCL and T cell malignancies, and in some patients with just one single course. Thus far, experience with this drug comes from one institution and requires further confirmation. For chronic myeloproliferative diseases, little progress has yet been made. Although IFN-alpha seems to be active in CML and to result in cytogenetic remissions in bone marrow, a definite advantage of this biological agent over conventional chemotherapy as regards survival and life quality has not yet been proven. Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation is beneficial for those patients who are eligible. No remarkable advances have been made in the treatment of myeloproliferative disorders except for the development of an antiplatelet drug, anagrelide. This agent seems to be highly effective in controlling thrombocytosis. The relative merit of this agent as compared with IFN-alpha, as well as the impact of this agent on the survival and on life-quality of patients with myeloproliferative disorders, have yet to be defined.","['Ho, A D']",['Ho AD'],,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Baillieres Clin Haematol,Bailliere's clinical haematology,8800474,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Chronic Disease', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Prolymphocytic/drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Prolymphocytic, T-Cell/drug therapy', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/*drug therapy', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/drug therapy', 'Thrombocythemia, Essential/drug therapy']",1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/s0950-3536(05)80291-4 [doi]'],ppublish,Baillieres Clin Haematol. 1991 Jan;4(1):197-221. doi: 10.1016/s0950-3536(05)80291-4.,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],119,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this report, a mouse model of BMT, in which the donor and host were compatible at the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), was used (1) to examine the interrelationship of pretransplant conditioning and T-cell content of donor BM with regard to lymphoid chimerism and GVHD and (2) to determine how these factors affected graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) reactivity and donor-host-tolerance. AKR (H-2k) host mice were administered optimal or suboptimal total body irradiation (TBI) as pretransplant conditioning followed by administration of BM cells from B10.BR (H-2k) donor mice with or without added spleen cells as a source of T lymphocytes. Transplanted mice were injected with a supralethal dose of AKR leukemia cells 20 and 45 days post-BMT to assess GVL reactivity in vivo. The pretransplant conditioning of the host and T-cell content of the donor marrow affected the extent of donor T-cell chimerism and the severity of GVH disease. GVL reactivity was dependent on transplantation of mature donor T cells and occurred only in complete chimeras. Transplantation of T-cell-deficient BM resulted in the persistence of host T cells, ie, incomplete donor T-cell chimerism, even when lethal TBI was used. Mixed chimerism was associated with a lack of GVL reactivity, despite the fact that similar numbers of donor T cells were present in the spleens of mixed and complete chimeras. In this model, moderate numbers of donor T cells facilitated complete donor T-cell engraftment, caused only mild GVHD, and provided a significant GVL effect without preventing the subsequent development of tolerance after conditioning with suboptimal TBI. In contrast, severe, often lethal, GVHD developed when the dose of TBI was increased, whereas tolerance and no GVH/GVL reactivity developed when the T-cell content of the marrow was decreased.","['Truitt, R L', 'Atasoylu, A A']","['Truitt RL', 'Atasoylu AA']","['Department of Pediatrics, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee 53226.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Animals', 'Blood Transfusion', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*immunology', 'Chimera', '*Graft vs Host Disease', 'Histocompatibility Testing', '*Immune Tolerance', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology/surgery', 'Lymphocyte Depletion', 'Major Histocompatibility Complex', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred AKR', 'Mice, Inbred CBA', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/transplantation', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",1991/06/01 00:00,1991/06/01 00:01,['1991/06/01 00:00'],"['1991/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)77843-2 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1991 Jun 1;77(11):2515-23.,,,,,['CA-39854/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Increasingly sensitive detection methods have shown that MC occurs frequently. We report a highly sensitive novel method to assess MC based on the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Simple dinucleotide repeat sequences called microsatellites have been found to vary in their repeat number between individuals. We use this variation to type donor-recipient pairs following allogeneic BMT. A panel of seven microsatellites was used to distinguish between donor and recipient cells of 32 transplants. Informative microsatellites were subsequently used to assess MC after BMT in this group of patients. Seventeen of the 32 transplants involved a donor of opposite sex; hence, cytogenetics and Y chromosome-specific PCR were also used as an index of chimerism in these patients. MC was detected in bone marrow aspirates and peripheral blood in 18 of 32 patients (56%) by PCR. In several cases, only stored slide material was available for analysis but PCR of microsatellites or Y chromosomal material could be used successfully to assess the origin of cells in this archival material. Cytogenetic analysis was possible in 17 patients and MC was detected in three patients. Twelve patients received T-cell-depleted marrow and showed a high incidence of MC as revealed by PCR (greater than 80%). Twenty patients received unmanipulated marrow, and while the incidence of MC was lower (44%), this was a high percentage when compared with other studies. Once MC was detected, the percentages of recipient cells tended to increase. However, in patients exhibiting MC who subsequently relapsed, this increase was relatively sudden. The overall level of recipient cells in the group of MC patients who subsequently relapsed was higher than in those who exhibited stable MC. Thus, while the occurrence of MC was not indicative of a poor prognosis per se, sudden increases in the proportions of recipient cells may be a prelude to graft rejection or relapse.","['Lawler, M', 'Humphries, P', 'McCann, S R']","['Lawler M', 'Humphries P', 'McCann SR']","['Department of Genetics, Trinity College, Dublin, Ireland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Anemia, Aplastic/pathology/surgery', 'Base Sequence', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', '*Chimera', 'Dinucleoside Phosphates/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Genetic Markers', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/pathology/surgery', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligonucleotide Probes', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', '*Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Y Chromosome']",1991/06/01 00:00,1991/06/01 00:01,['1991/06/01 00:00'],"['1991/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)77842-0 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1991 Jun 1;77(11):2504-14.,"['0 (Dinucleoside Phosphates)', '0 (Genetic Markers)', '0 (Oligonucleotide Probes)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Upon intraperitoneal (IP) transfer, cells from relapse samples of three children with T-lineage ALL spread hematogenously and infiltrated the non-lymphoid and/or lymphoid organs with a pattern reminiscent of the human clinical disease. These mice either died or were killed in extremis at a mean of 9 weeks. Moreover, cell lines established in vitro from two of these samples manifested identical homing and progression in the SCID mouse as compared with the original patients' cells. Thus, long-term culture of the primary leukemic T cells did not alter their invasive potential and migration pattern. When engrafted IP, three cell lines established from pre-B-ALL cases displayed primarily a lymphatic spread with induction of local tumor masses and kidney/liver nodules. Mice were killed at 11 to 13 weeks, but had not developed imminently fatal leukemia. However, when transferred intravenously, one pre-B ALL cell line was able to spread hematogenously and to infiltrate both lymphoid and non-lymphoid tissues. Overall, these data demonstrate that the SCID mouse provides an efficient and reproducible model to study the pathogenesis of childhood ALL, and may be a suitable system for evaluating therapy.","['Cesano, A', ""O'Connor, R"", 'Lange, B', 'Finan, J', 'Rovera, G', 'Santoli, D']","['Cesano A', ""O'Connor R"", 'Lange B', 'Finan J', 'Rovera G', 'Santoli D']","['Wistar Institute of Anatomy and Biology, Philadelphia, PA 19104.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'Cell Line', 'Child', 'Female', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes/*pathology', 'Islets of Langerhans/pathology', 'Kidney/pathology', 'Liver/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Mutant Strains', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Phenotype', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/immunology/*pathology', 'Transplantation, Heterologous']",1991/06/01 00:00,1991/06/01 00:01,['1991/06/01 00:00'],"['1991/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)77837-7 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1991 Jun 1;77(11):2463-74.,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)']",,,,"['CA-10815/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-25875/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-47589/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Morphologic analysis of the end-therapy specimens from each patient had shown small numbers (7.5%, 8.5%) of cells that were suspicious for residual or recurrent disease. These cells could not be morphologically or immunophenotypically distinguished with certainty from immature lymphoid cells (hematogones), which may be present normally, sometimes in increased numbers, in the bone marrow specimens of children. In situ hybridization with a probe to chromosome 17 was used because the leukemic cells from each patient had originally been shown to have an extra copy of this chromosome. In one patient, in situ studies showed a population of cells (106 of 1,000 cells) with three hybridization signals indicating trisomy 17, and thus residual/recurrent leukemia. In the other patient trisomy 17 could not be detected. Additional hybridizations to previously stained bone marrow aspirate smears permitted a direct correlation of the cytogenetic findings with the suspicious cells on a cell-to-cell basis. The questionable cells were identified, photographed, and then re-examined after hybridization. In one patient, 13 of 18 (72%) of the suspicious cells were found to have trisomy 17, whereas in the other patient 0 of 24 (0%) demonstrated an extra copy of this chromosome. These cases illustrate a clinical application of interphase cytogenetic analysis and demonstrate how this technology can be used for direct correlation of cytogenetic findings with cell morphology.

These results suggested that serum TNF-beta might be one of the factors contributing to the hypercalcemia, at least in patients with ATL.","['Ishibashi, K', 'Ishitsuka, K', 'Chuman, Y', 'Otsuka, M', 'Kuwazuru, Y', 'Iwahashi, M', 'Utsunomiya, A', 'Hanada, S', 'Sakurami, T', 'Arima, T']","['Ishibashi K', 'Ishitsuka K', 'Chuman Y', 'Otsuka M', 'Kuwazuru Y', 'Iwahashi M', 'Utsunomiya A', 'Hanada S', 'Sakurami T', 'Arima T']","['Second Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Kagoshima University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Calcium/*blood', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Humans', 'Hypercalcemia/*blood', 'L Cells/cytology/drug effects', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*blood/complications', 'Lymphotoxin-alpha/*blood/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology']",1991/06/01 00:00,1991/06/01 00:01,['1991/06/01 00:00'],"['1991/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)77835-3 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1991 Jun 1;77(11):2451-5.,"['0 (Lymphotoxin-alpha)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present report, we have examined the effect of IL-7 on neoplastic B-cell precursors. Leukemic cells from 20 patients with common acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) were highly purified by removing contaminating T cells and monocytes by rosetting with immunomagnetic beads. IL-7 markedly reduced the DNA synthesis in leukemic cells from three patients. This inhibition of DNA synthesis was accompanied by maturation of the cells, as demonstrated by the induced expression of the differentiation antigens CD19, CD20, CDw75, and surface mu-chain, and a decreased expression of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase. By examining G1 parameters, such as MYC, 4F2, and transferrin-receptor levels analyzed by flow cytometry as well as RNA and the cell cycle regulated antigen Ki67, it appeared that the cells were inhibited late in G1. Leukemic cells from the majority of the cases (12 of the 20 patients) responded to IL-7 with enhanced DNA synthesis without detectable maturation, as has been reported for their normal counterparts. Low molecular weight B-cell growth factor greatly potentiated the IL-7-induced growth stimulation of these cells. Thus, we have shown that IL-7 is capable of inhibiting proliferation of leukemic cells isolated from a subgroup of ALLs, and that this growth inhibition is accompanied by maturation of the cells.","['Skjonsberg, C', 'Erikstein, B K', 'Smeland, E B', 'Lie, S O', 'Funderud, S', 'Beiske, K', 'Blomhoff, H K']","['Skjonsberg C', 'Erikstein BK', 'Smeland EB', 'Lie SO', 'Funderud S', 'Beiske K', 'Blomhoff HK']","['Department of Pathology, Norwegian Radium Hospital, Oslo.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/*analysis', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'DNA Replication/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Flow Cytometry/methods', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-4/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-7/*pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*immunology', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/cytology/drug effects/immunology']",1991/06/01 00:00,1991/06/01 00:01,['1991/06/01 00:00'],"['1991/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)77834-1 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1991 Jun 1;77(11):2445-50.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Interleukin-7)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There were 12 patients initially studied in accelerated or blastic phases. All but one patient showed gene hypermethylation, suggesting a good correlation between gene methylation and disease stage. All five patients who, while still in the chronic phase, had a major 3.1-kb hypermethylated calcitonin gene fragment, accelerated within 2 to 27 months. In consecutively analyzed patients, the initially normal calcitonin gene changed to a hypermethylated state as the disease escalated. The hypermethylation predicted disease acceleration with a median lead time of 6 months before any morphologic or clinical signs of disease progression were seen. The disease progressed in 8 of 27 patients initially studied in the chronic phase: in only two patients this occurred without predictive methylation changes.

We have previously reported a consistent pattern of novel sites of methylation in the 5' region of the calcitonin (CT) gene and other chromosome 11p loci in acute myelogenous and and lymphoid leukemias. In the present study, CT gene methylation patterns were investigated in peripheral blood from 51 patients with CML. Abnormal patterns were found in only 2 of 31 patients in chronic phase, but in 5 of 8 patients in accelerated phase, and in 11 of 12 patients in blast crisis (P less than .005). For one patient studied in blast crisis, abnormal CT gene methylation was found in the peripheral blast cells but not in the granulocytes. In two of three patients studied with CML and having normal peripheral cell patterns, abnormal patterns were found in marrow blast cells. In one patient, only partial normalization of the CT gene methylation pattern was seen after chemotherapy induction of a second chronic phase and the patient relapsed 5 months later. Our findings indicate that abnormal methylation of the 5' region of the CT gene is regularly a marker of disease progression in CML which may prove clinically useful. This abnormal methylation site is part of an imbalance in DNA methylation that may play a role in the progressive genetic instability which characterizes the advancing stages of CML.","['Nelkin, B D', 'Przepiorka, D', 'Burke, P J', 'Thomas, E D', 'Baylin, S B']","['Nelkin BD', 'Przepiorka D', 'Burke PJ', 'Thomas ED', 'Baylin SB']","['Oncology Center, Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, Baltimore, MD.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis', 'Blast Crisis/diagnosis', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Calcitonin/*genetics', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*genetics/isolation & purification', 'Gene Rearrangement', '*Genetic Markers', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/pathology', 'Methylation', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Restriction Mapping']",1991/06/01 00:00,1991/06/01 00:01,['1991/06/01 00:00'],"['1991/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)77831-6 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1991 Jun 1;77(11):2431-4.,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Genetic Markers)', '9007-12-9 (Calcitonin)']",,,,"['CA09515/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA18029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA43318/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

However, because ATLL and non-HTLV-I associated T-cell neoplasms share overlapping clinicopathologic features, the prevalence of ATLL in nonendemic regions is unknown. In this study, 75 T-cell neoplasms randomly procured from the metropolitan New York City area were examined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the presence of integrated HTLV-I proviral sequences. HTLV-I genomic sequences were detected by PCR in 6 of the 75 cases (8%); this result was confirmed by Southern blot hybridization. The clinicopathologic features of the HTLV-I positive and HTLV-I negative T-cell neoplasms were then compared. Although the clinicopathologic features of patients from these two groups overlapped, some findings were more commonly associated with HTLV-I positive neoplasms. Five of the six patients with HTLV-I positive neoplasms were from HTLV-I endemic areas, five were black, five were women, and five were less than 45 years of age, while the majority of the patients with HTLV-I negative T-cell malignancies were elderly white men. The incidence of hypercalcemia and lytic bone lesions was significantly more common among patients with HTLV-I positive T-cell neoplasms (P less than .001 and P = .004, respectively). The immunophenotypes of the HTLV-I positive and negative tumors were similar; however, all HTLV-I positive neoplasms were CD7 negative (P less than .001). In summary, our findings: (1) demonstrate the special clinicopathologic and immunophenotypic features of HTLV-I positive T-cell neoplasms, (2) suggest that most of the rare cases of HTLV-I-associated T-cell neoplasms occurring in HTLV-I nonendemic areas are actually endemic cases; and (3) that PCR is a sensitive, clinically useful technique for identifying HTLV-I associated T-cell neoplasms.","['Chadburn, A', 'Athan, E', 'Wieczorek, R', 'Knowles, D M']","['Chadburn A', 'Athan E', 'Wieczorek R', 'Knowles DM']","['Department of Pathology, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY 10032.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adult', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Southern', 'DNA, Viral/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Female', 'Genes, Viral', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/*isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*microbiology/pathology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/epidemiology/*microbiology/pathology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/*microbiology/pathology', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'New York City', 'Oligonucleotide Probes', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Prevalence']",1991/06/01 00:00,1991/06/01 00:01,['1991/06/01 00:00'],"['1991/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)77830-4 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1991 Jun 1;77(11):2419-30.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Oligonucleotide Probes)']",,,,"['CA48236/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'EY06337/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

The monoclonal antibody (MoAb) anti-MY9 is potentially ideal for selective recognition of AML cells because it reacts with an antigen (CD33) found on clonogenic AML cells from greater than 80% of cases and does not react with normal pluripotent stem cells. In this study, we describe an immunotoxin that is selectively active against CD33+ AML cells: Anti-MY9-blocked-Ricin (Anti-MY9-bR), comprised of anti-MY9 conjugated to a modified whole ricin that has its nonspecific binding eliminated by chemical blockage of the galactose binding domains of the B-chain. A limiting dilution assay was used to measure elimination of HL-60 leukemic cells from a 20-fold excess of normal bone marrow cells. Depletion of CD33+ HL-60 cells was found to be dependent on the concentration of Anti-MY9-bR and on the duration of incubation with IT at 37 degrees C. More than 4 logs of these leukemic cells were specifically depleted following short exposure to high concentrations (10(-8) mol/L) of Anti-MY9-bR. Incubation with much lower concentrations of Anti-MY9-bR (10(-10) mol/L), as compatible with in vivo administration, resulted in 2 logs of depletion of HL-60 cells, but 48 to 72 hours of continuous exposure were required. Anti-MY9-bR was also shown to be toxic to primary AML cells, with depletion of greater than 2 logs of clonogenic cells following incubation with Anti-MY9-bR 10(-8) mol/L at 37 degrees C for 5 hours. Activity of Anti-MY9-bR could be blocked by unconjugated Anti-MY9 but not by galactose. As expected, Anti-MY9-bR was toxic to normal colony-forming unit granulocyte-monocyte (CFU-GM), which expresses CD33, in a concentration- and time-dependent manner, and also to burst-forming unit-erythroid and CFU-granulocyte, erythroid, monocyte, megakaryocyte, although to a lesser extent. When compared with anti-MY9 and complement (C'), Anti-MY9-bR could be used in conditions that provided more effective depletion of AML cells with substantially less depletion of normal CFU-GM. Therefore, Anti-MY9-bR may have clinical utility for in vitro purging of AML cells from autologous marrow when used at high IT concentrations for short incubation periods. Much lower concentrations of Anti-MY9-bR that can be maintained for longer periods may be useful for elimination of AML cells in vivo.","['Roy, D C', 'Griffin, J D', 'Belvin, M', 'Blattler, W A', 'Lambert, J M', 'Ritz, J']","['Roy DC', 'Griffin JD', 'Belvin M', 'Blattler WA', 'Lambert JM', 'Ritz J']","['Division of Tumor Immunology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Line', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Complement System Proteins/immunology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/drug effects/pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunotoxins/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*blood/pathology/therapy', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Monocytes/cytology/radiation effects', 'Ricin/*pharmacology/therapeutic use']",1991/06/01 00:00,1991/06/01 00:01,['1991/06/01 00:00'],"['1991/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)77828-6 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1991 Jun 1;77(11):2404-12.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Immunotoxins)', '9007-36-7 (Complement System Proteins)', '9009-86-3 (Ricin)']",,,,['CA34183/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Seven patients with acute leukemia who had been transfused during induction therapy were used as the test group, and, as a control group, five untransfused patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia were also studied. Concurrent fibrinogen survival measurements were performed in all patients to assess whether hemostatic factor consumption (ie, disseminated intravascular coagulation) was present. Allogeneic platelet survival measurements were reduced from normal in all 12 study patients. In 8 of 12 patients, fibrinogen and platelet survival measurements were comparably reduced, suggesting disease-related platelet consumption. In four heavily transfused patients with acute leukemia, allogeneic platelet survivals were markedly reduced to less than or equal to 2.1 days, compared with the 3.5- to 7.4-day platelet survival measurements found in the other eight patients. The disproportionately short platelet survivals compared with fibrinogen survival measurements in these four patients, combined with documented positive antibody tests to their donors' platelets in the three patients with evaluable tests, suggested that these patients had become alloimmunized to platelets because of their prior transfusions. There was substantial concordance between the two radiolabeled allogeneic donor platelet survival measurements performed in each of these patients, suggesting that host rather than donor factors have a major influence on transfusion outcome (r = .93, P less than .001). The platelet cross-match tests, using the radiolabeled protein Staph A assay combined with the IgG enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay test, had the best correlation with the posttransfusion recovery and survival of the donors' platelets.","['Bensinger, W I', 'Hadlock, J', 'Slichter, S J']","['Bensinger WI', 'Hadlock J', 'Slichter SJ']","['Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA 98104.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['ABO Blood-Group System', 'Acute Disease', 'Blood Platelets/*immunology', '*Blood Transfusion', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Female', 'Fibrinogen/analysis', '*Graft Survival', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G/analysis', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia/*immunology/surgery', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/immunology/surgery', 'Male', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1991/06/01 00:00,1991/06/01 00:01,['1991/06/01 00:00'],"['1991/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)77824-9 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1991 Jun 1;77(11):2372-8.,"['0 (ABO Blood-Group System)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '9001-32-5 (Fibrinogen)']",,,,"['CA 18029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL 33775/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

In both wild-type and highly dexamethasone(dex)-resistant clones of the human leukemic cell line CEM, exposure to cortivazol leads to cell death. It has been shown recently that in wild-type CEM cells but not in a dex-resistant, glucocorticoid receptor(GR)-defective clone ICR-27 TK-3, dex induces GR mRNA. To test the hypothesis that cortivazol acts in dex-resistant cells by making use of the residual GR found there, wild-type and dex-resistant clones were treated with various concentrations of cortivazol and induction of GR mRNA was studied. Cortivazol significantly induced GR mRNA in the normal CEM-C7 as well as in two classes of dex-resistant clones, although the dex-resistant clones needed at least 10 times more cortivazol than the normal cells for significant GR mRNA induction. Increased levels of GR mRNA were noticed as early as 3 h after treatment. A general correlation between induction of GR mRNA and lysis of the normal and dex-resistant cells was found. Positive induction of GR mRNA might be one of the earliest crucial steps in the lysis of normal and dex-resistant CEM cells, or might serve as a marker for the process. However, the lysis pathway in the dex-resistant cells is defective in that dex-resistant clones needed significantly more cortivazol than the normal cells for lysis of the cells.","['Ashraf, J', 'Kunapuli, S', 'Chilton, D', 'Thompson, E B']","['Ashraf J', 'Kunapuli S', 'Chilton D', 'Thompson EB']","['Department of Human Biological Chemistry and Genetics, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston 77550.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,J Steroid Biochem Mol Biol,The Journal of steroid biochemistry and molecular biology,9015483,IM,"['Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dexamethasone/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Glucocorticoids/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell', 'Mutation', 'Pregnatrienes/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Receptors, Glucocorticoid/*genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1991/05/01 00:00,1991/05/01 00:01,['1991/05/01 00:00'],"['1991/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0960-0760(91)90313-t [doi]'],ppublish,J Steroid Biochem Mol Biol. 1991 May;38(5):561-8. doi: 10.1016/0960-0760(91)90313-t.,"['0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Pregnatrienes)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Glucocorticoid)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'YM183K0H63 (cortivazol)']",,,,['CA 41407/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The risk of myeloid leukaemia in patients who received cyclophosphamide as part of their chemotherapy regimen was 7.4 (95% confidence interval 1.3-43.8). This risk was not altered appreciably by the administration of radiotherapy. Compared to patients not receiving any chemotherapy, the relative risk among patients who received prednisone in combination with cyclophosphamide (odds ratio 44.4 95% confidence interval 4.0-496.2) was nearly four times that among patients receiving cyclophosphamide without this steroid (odds ratio 12.6 95% confidence interval 2.4-64.9). The relative risk of second primary myeloid leukaemia in patients who received both prednisone and drugs other than cyclophosphamide (odds ratio 64.2 95% confidence interval 2.6-1582) was 20 times that among patients receiving drugs other than cyclophosphamide and no prednisone (odds ratio 3.2 95% confidence interval 0.6-16.9). These risk estimates were higher when the analysis was restricted to acute myeloid leukaemia. There was no increased risk of second primary myeloid leukaemia associated with radiotherapy. The single unique finding is that the use of prednisone in chemotherapy regimens may enhance the leukaemogenic effect of other chemotherapy drugs.","['Nandakumar, A', 'Davis, S', 'Moolgavkar, S', 'Witherspoon, R P', 'Schwartz, S M']","['Nandakumar A', 'Davis S', 'Moolgavkar S', 'Witherspoon RP', 'Schwartz SM']","['Kidwai Memorial Institute of Oncology, Bangalore, India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Multiple Primary/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Odds Ratio', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage/adverse effects']",1991/05/01 00:00,1991/05/01 00:01,['1991/05/01 00:00'],"['1991/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/bjc.1991.174 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1991 May;63(5):782-8. doi: 10.1038/bjc.1991.174.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)']",,,,"['CA 15704/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 18029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 18221/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC1972376,,,,,,,,,,,

Three mutants were found to be significantly temperature sensitive: Ile-36 changed to Leu, Ser-39 changed to Cys (S39C), and Arg-41 changed to Leu. Of these, the codon 39 mutant (S39C) showed the greatest degree of temperature sensitivity. When the same mutation was analyzed in the proto-oncogene form of ras(c-rasH), this gene was also found to be temperature sensitive for transformation. Biochemical analysis of the proteins encoded by v-rasH(S39C) and c-rasH(S39C) demonstrated that the encoded p21ras proteins were stable and bound guanine nucleotides in vivo at permissive and nonpermissive temperatures. On the basis of these findings, it is likely that the temperature-sensitive phenotype results from an inability of the mutant (S39C) p21ras to interact properly with the ras target effector molecule(s) at the nonpermissive temperature. We therefore analyzed the interaction between the c-rasH(S39C) protein and the potential target molecules GTPase-activating protein (GAP) and the GAP-related domain of NF-1, on the basis of stimulation of the mutant p21ras GTPase activity by these molecules in vitro. Assays conducted across a range of temperatures revealed no temperature sensitivity for stimulation of the mutant protein, compared with that of authentic c-rasH protein. We conclude that for this mutant, there is a dissociation between the stimulation of p21ras GTPase activity by GAP and the GAP-related domain NF-1 and their potential target function. Our results are also consistent with the existence of a distinct, as-yet-unidentified effector for mammalian ras proteins.","['DeClue, J E', 'Stone, J C', 'Blanchard, R A', 'Papageorge, A G', 'Martin, P', 'Zhang, K', 'Lowy, D R']","['DeClue JE', 'Stone JC', 'Blanchard RA', 'Papageorge AG', 'Martin P', 'Zhang K', 'Lowy DR']","['Laboratory of Cellular Oncology, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Codon', 'GTPase-Activating Proteins', '*Genes, ras', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', '*Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Neurofibromin 1', 'Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras)/biosynthesis/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Proto-Oncogenes', 'Rats', 'Temperature', 'Transfection', 'ras GTPase-Activating Proteins']",1991/06/01 00:00,1991/06/01 00:01,['1991/06/01 00:00'],"['1991/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/mcb.11.6.3132-3138.1991 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1991 Jun;11(6):3132-8. doi: 10.1128/mcb.11.6.3132-3138.1991.,"['0 (Codon)', '0 (GTPase-Activating Proteins)', '0 (Neurofibromin 1)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (ras GTPase-Activating Proteins)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras))']",,['ras'],,,PMC360160,,,,,,,,,,,

Analysis of the tal-1 gene product reveals that its HLH domain mediates protein-protein interactions with either of the ubiquitously expressed HLH proteins E47 and E12. The resultant tal-1/E47 and tal-1/E12 heterodimers specifically recognize the E-box DNA sequence motif found in eucaryotic transcriptional enhancers. Hence, the tal-1 protein shares biochemical properties with other tissue-specific HLH proteins that control cell type determination during myogenesis (e.g., MyoD1) and neurogenesis (e.g., achaete-scute).

The vaccine was prepared by irradiating L1210 leukemia cells in a cesium source with a total of 6000-R dose. DBA/2 mice were treated with 150 mg/kg 7T8OG and/or with vaccine consisting of 10(7) irradiated cells. In combination therapy, mice first received the vaccine and then were injected with 75 mg/kg 7T8OG 2 h and 4 h after vaccination. One week after the last treatment all mice were inoculated with 10(4) live leukemia cells intraperitoneally. Control, untreated mice (n = 66) injected with 10(4) live leukemia cells had a mean survival time +/- standard error of 10.5 +/- 0.2 days. Treating mice (n = 66) with one, two or three doses of 7T8OG administered i.p. 1 week apart did not increase survival (mean survival time = 10.7 days). Mice immunized with one, two or three doses of vaccine had 14.5 +/- 1.1, 45.4 +/- 6.2 and 68.3 +/- 10.6 days mean survival, respectively. 7T8OG-stimulated vaccination increased the survival dramatically. The best survival was noted when the mice were treated with 2x (vaccine + 7T8OG). Immunization of mice (n = 30) with this treatment regimen increased the mean survival to 156 +/- 10.0 days. Over 90% of mice that were treated this way had a cumulative survival time greater than 160 days. In contrast, only 12% of the mice immunized twice with the leukemia vaccine alone survived over 160 days. These results suggest a rationale for the use of this immuno-potentiator with various vaccines for a more effective immunization.","['Sharma, B S', 'Balazs, L', 'Jin, A', 'Wang, J C', 'Jolley, W B', 'Robins, R K']","['Sharma BS', 'Balazs L', 'Jin A', 'Wang JC', 'Jolley WB', 'Robins RK']","['ICN Nucleic Acid Research Institute, Costa Mesa, CA 92625.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,IM,"['Adjuvants, Immunologic/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Cell Division', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Guanosine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Immunization', 'Leukemia L1210/*immunology/mortality/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Survival Rate', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Vaccines/*immunology']",1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF01742538 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 1991;33(2):109-14. doi: 10.1007/BF01742538.,"['0 (Adjuvants, Immunologic)', '0 (Vaccines)', '12133JR80S (Guanosine)', '85141ONN7O (isatoribine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Aberrations of chromosome 6 correlated significantly with an advanced clinical stage, diffuse pattern of bone marrow infiltration, and increased SmIgM-fluorescence intensity. All these factors are associated with poor prognosis.

Although of very similar origin, these two cell lines behave quite differently. In particular, CEM cell line exhibited an abnormal replication banding pattern (RBP) and poor sister chromatid differentiation (SCD). Study of their thymidylate synthase and thymidine kinase activities indicated that CEM had a more active salvage pathway for thymidylate synthesis than did PEER cell line, which may suggest an efficient BrdU incorporation and its fast decrease in culture medium, resulting in the observed peculiarities. However, this was contradictory to the fact that CEM need a higher dose of BrdU than do PEER cells to induce SCD and RBP. Finally, the radioactivity from 3H-thymidine decreased in the culture medium much faster for PEER cell line than for CEM cell line, and about 50% of the remaining radioactivity was due to 3H-thymidine for CEM cell line. Thus, the abnormal SCD and RBP are explained by an active catabolism of thymidine and BrdU in CEM cell line.","['Massaad, L', 'Venuat, A M', 'Luccioni, C', 'Beaumatin, J', 'Lemieux, N', 'Dutrillaux, B']","['Massaad L', 'Venuat AM', 'Luccioni C', 'Beaumatin J', 'Lemieux N', 'Dutrillaux B']","['Section de Biologie URA 620, C.N.R.S., Institut Curie, Paris, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,IM,"['Bromodeoxyuridine/*metabolism', '*Chromosome Banding', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*genetics/metabolism', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', '*Sister Chromatid Exchange', 'Thymidine Kinase/metabolism', 'Thymidylate Synthase/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1991/05/01 00:00,1991/05/01 00:01,['1991/05/01 00:00'],"['1991/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0165-4608(91)90111-7 [pii]', '10.1016/0165-4608(91)90111-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 1991 May;53(1):23-34. doi: 10.1016/0165-4608(91)90111-7.,"['EC 2.1.1.45 (Thymidylate Synthase)', 'EC 2.7.1.21 (Thymidine Kinase)', 'G34N38R2N1 (Bromodeoxyuridine)']",,,,,,,,['Cancer Genet Cytogenet 1991 Jul 15;54(2):following 279'],,,,,,,,

Both N-IND and IND cells accumulate Ca2+ in the presence of ATP after electropermeabilization. The Ca2+ is stored in at least two different compartments; accumulation in one of the compartments is inhibited by oligomycin and CCCP, and it is not releasable by Ins(1,4,5)P3. The maximal accumulation of Ca2+ by the Ins(1,4,5)P3 sensitive pool is about 0.3 nmol/10(6) cells and 0.9 nmol/10(6) cells for the N-IND and for the IND cells, respectively, and the half-maximal value occurs at a free Ca2+ concentration of 0.23 microM and 0.63 microM, respectively.

This was followed by consolidation of 5-2 as per ALSG and one cycle of maintenance with low dose cytosine arabinoside. Ten months after remission, he relapsed but achieved a second remission with the ALSG 7-3-7 protocol (7-3 plus etoposide) followed by consolidation with 5-2-5. He remained HIV positive but showed little progression towards the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome despite the intense immunosuppression. The duration of his second remission was five months.

Eosinophilic fasciitis as a paraneoplastic syndrome of T-cell malignant neoplasms?,862-5,"Eosinophilic fasciitis has been reported to precede hematologic malignant neoplasms such as myelomonocytic leukemia, lymphocytic leukemia, and Hodgkin's lymphoma. In this case study, eosinophilic fasciitis occurred concurrently with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (mycosis fungoides). The clinical diagnosis of eosinophilic fasciitis was based on painful sclerodermatous lesions on the extremities and trunk without acrosclerosis. There was histologic confirmation with edema and lymphocytic inflammation in the superficial muscular fascia and dermis. Deposition of immune reactants was found in the fascia and dermis. In addition, peripheral eosinophilia and circulating immune complexes were detected. The diagnosis of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (mycosis fungoides) was based on extensive erythematous cutaneous plaques, dermal and epidermal lymphocytic atypia, loss of pan-T-cell immunologic markers, and a cutaneous lesional T-cell receptor beta-chain rearrangement by Southern blot analysis. Eosinophilic fasciitis may occur as a paraneoplastic syndrome associated with hematologic malignant neoplasms, including mycosis fungoides. Cytokines or lymphokines released by activated immunocytes, either malignant leukocytes or normal leukocytes reacting to malignant cells, may be responsible for the eosinophilia and sclerosis seen in these associated hematologic malignant neoplasms.","['Chan, L S', 'Hanson, C A', 'Cooper, K D']","['Chan LS', 'Hanson CA', 'Cooper KD']","['Department of Dermatology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Arch Dermatol,Archives of dermatology,0372433,IM,"['Aged', 'Eosinophilia/*complications/pathology', 'Fasciitis/*complications/pathology', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell, Cutaneous/*complications/pathology', 'Male', '*Paraneoplastic Syndromes/pathology', 'Skin Neoplasms/*complications/pathology']",1991/06/01 00:00,1991/06/01 00:01,['1991/06/01 00:00'],"['1991/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Arch Dermatol. 1991 Jun;127(6):862-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All three cell lines were sensitive to cytostatic drugs, which exerted a parallel decrease in the intracellular FDG and ATP levels. The two measures correlated positively (r = 0.66, P less than 0.001), indicating that FDG uptake is closely linked with ATP production. Relatively low hexokinase (HK)-to-glucose 6-phosphatase (HK/G6-Pase) ratios were measured, which suggests that the metabolic trapping of FDG 6-phosphate within the cytosol is incomplete.

The magnitude of cytotoxicity induced directly by thymidine was also evaluated. Finally, the ability of 2'-deoxycytidine to prevent thymidine-induced cytotoxicity and radiosensitization was studied. Using JM and MOLT3, two human T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias, it was found that thymidine itself was cytotoxic and the toxicity appeared rapidly upon exposure to the drug (i.e., at 4 h). Thymidine caused significant radiosensitization, and thymidine plus 1 h of 41.8 degrees C hyperthermia enhanced radiation-induced killing significantly more than did thymidine or hyperthermia separately. The addition of 2'-deoxycytidine only partly reversed thymidine-induced killing and did not prevent thymidine-induced radiosensitization. The applicability of these results to the clinical management of T- and null-cell malignancies is discussed, as is the presumed mechanistic basis for these observations relative to deoxyribonucleoside metabolism, NAD metabolism, and inhibition of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase.","['Cohen, J D', 'Schmitt, C L', 'Robins, H I']","['Cohen JD', 'Schmitt CL', 'Robins HI']","['Department of Neurological Surgery, University of Wisconsin Clinical Sciences Center, Madison 53792.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Radiat Res,Radiation research,0401245,IM,"['Cell Survival/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Cesium Radioisotopes/therapeutic use', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Deoxycytidine/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Humans', '*Hyperthermia, Induced', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*therapy', 'Radiation Tolerance/*drug effects/physiology', 'Thymidine/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/radiation effects']",1991/06/01 00:00,1991/06/01 00:01,['1991/06/01 00:00'],"['1991/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Radiat Res. 1991 Jun;126(3):372-8.,"['0 (Cesium Radioisotopes)', '0W860991D6 (Deoxycytidine)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",,,,['T32 CA 09615/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Multiplicative adjustments to the excess risk either of the form exp[-delta.(time since exposure)] or of the form [time since exposure] gamma give equivalent goodness of fit. Using the former type of adjustment an annual overall reduction of 6.9-8.6% in excess relative risk is indicated (depending on the year after which this reduction might take effect). Using the second type of multiplier an adjustment to the excess relative risk varying between [time after exposure]-2.0 and [time after exposure]-3.2 fits best overall. All these reductions are statistically significant at the 5% level. There is no significant variation by cohort, by sex, by cancer type, or by age at exposure group in the degree of annual reduction in excess relative risk. Although time-adjusted relative and absolute risk models give equivalently good fits within each cohort, there is significant variation between cohorts in the degree of increase of risk with time in the absolute risk formulation, in contrast to the lack of such heterogeneity for the relative risk formulation. It is shown that if the range of observed reductions in relative risk is assumed to operate 40 or more years after exposure in the youngest age groups, the calculated UK population risks would be reduced by 30-45% compared to those based on a constant relative risk model.","['Little, M P', 'Hawkins, M M', 'Shore, R E', 'Charles, M W', 'Hildreth, N G']","['Little MP', 'Hawkins MM', 'Shore RE', 'Charles MW', 'Hildreth NG']","['Radiological Protection Branch, Berkeley Nuclear Laboratories, Glos, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Radiat Res,Radiation research,0401245,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Factors', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Models, Statistical', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology', 'Risk Factors', 'Sex Factors', 'Time Factors']",1991/06/01 00:00,1991/06/01 00:01,['1991/06/01 00:00'],"['1991/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Radiat Res. 1991 Jun;126(3):304-16.,,,,,"['CA-19764/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-43175/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,['Radiat Res 1992 Oct;132(1):126'],,,,,,,,

This gene encodes a protein with duplicated cysteine-rich regions called LIM domains, which show homology to zinc-binding proteins and to iron-sulfur centers of ferredoxins. Two homologues of the rhombotin gene have now been isolated. One of these, designated Rhom-2, is located on human chromosome 11 at band 11p13, where a cluster of T-cell leukemia-specific translocations occur; all translocation breakpoints at 11p13 are upstream of the Rhom-2 gene. Human and mouse Rhom-2 are highly conserved and, like rhombotin, encode two tandem cysteine-rich LIM domains. Rhom-2 mRNA is expressed in early mouse development in central nervous system, lung, kidney, liver, and spleen but only very low levels occur in thymus. The other gene, designated Rhom-3, is not on chromosome 11 but also retains homology to the LIM domain of rhombotin. Since the Rhom-2 gene is such a common site of chromosomal damage in T-cell tumors, the consistency of translocations near the rhombotin gene was further examined. A second translocation adjacent to rhombotin was found and at the same position as in the previous example. Therefore, chromosome bands 11p15 (rhombotin) and 11p13 (Rhom-2) are consistent sites of chromosome translocation in T-cell leukemia, with the 11p15 target more rarely involved. The results define the rhombotin gene family as a class of T-cell oncogenes with duplicated cysteine-rich LIM domains.","['Boehm, T', 'Foroni, L', 'Kaneko, Y', 'Perutz, M F', 'Rabbitts, T H']","['Boehm T', 'Foroni L', 'Kaneko Y', 'Perutz MF', 'Rabbitts TH']","['Medical Research Council Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge United Kingdom.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Biological Evolution', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', '*Cysteine', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Exons', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'LIM Domain Proteins', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Multigene Family', 'Nuclear Proteins', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Oncogene Proteins', '*Oncogenes', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'T-Lymphocytes/*ultrastructure', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', '*Translocation, Genetic']",1991/05/15 00:00,1991/05/15 00:01,['1991/05/15 00:00'],"['1991/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/05/15 00:01 [medline]', '1991/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.88.10.4367 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1991 May 15;88(10):4367-71. doi: 10.1073/pnas.88.10.4367.,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (LIM Domain Proteins)', '0 (LMO1 protein, human)', '0 (Lmo1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'K848JZ4886 (Cysteine)']",,['Rhom-2'],,,PMC51660,,"['GENBANK/M57642', 'GENBANK/M57643', 'GENBANK/M57644', 'GENBANK/M64357', 'GENBANK/M64358', 'GENBANK/M64359', 'GENBANK/M64360', 'GENBANK/M64361', 'GENBANK/M68851', 'GENBANK/M68852']",,,,,,,,,

BSM is derived from a mouse erythroleukemia cell line and carries a single human chromosome 11 with the beta S-globin allele. A beta A-globin targeting construct containing a unique oligomer and a neomycin-resistance gene was electroporated into the BSM cells, which were then placed under G418 selection. Then 126 resulting pools containing a total of approximately 29,000 G418-resistant clones were screened by PCR for the presence of a targeted recombinant: 3 positive pools were identified. A targeted clone was isolated by replating one of the positive pools into smaller pools and rescreening by PCR, followed by dilution cloning. Southern blot analysis demonstrated that the isolated clone had been targeted as planned. The correction of the beta S allele to beta A was confirmed both by allele-specific PCR and by allele-specific antibodies. Expression studies comparing the uninduced and induced RNA levels in unmodified BSM cells and in the targeted clone showed no significant alteration in the ability of the targeted clone to undergo induction, despite the potentially disrupting presence of a transcriptionally active neomycin gene 5' to the human beta A-globin gene. Thus gene targeting can correct a beta S allele to beta A, and the use of a selectable helper gene need not significantly interfere with the induction of the corrected gene.","['Shesely, E G', 'Kim, H S', 'Shehee, W R', 'Papayannopoulou, T', 'Smithies, O', 'Popovich, B W']","['Shesely EG', 'Kim HS', 'Shehee WR', 'Papayannopoulou T', 'Smithies O', 'Popovich BW']","['Department of Pathology, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill 27599-7525.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Globins/*genetics', 'Hemoglobin, Sickle/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Hybrid Cells', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Lymphocytes', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1991/05/15 00:00,1991/05/15 00:01,['1991/05/15 00:00'],"['1991/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/05/15 00:01 [medline]', '1991/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.88.10.4294 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1991 May 15;88(10):4294-8. doi: 10.1073/pnas.88.10.4294.,"['0 (Hemoglobin, Sickle)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)']",,,,"['GM12285/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'GM20069/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'HL37001/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC51645,,,,,,,,,,,

Binding was temperature dependent, saturable, and specific. Analysis of the data demonstrated a single class of binding sites with high affinity for the ligand (Kd approximately 3.2 +/- 0.5 x 10(-11) M) and a binding capacity of 0.42 fmol/10(6) cells (approximately 300 sites/cell). These CCK binding sites displayed a typical CCK-B pharmacological profile, established by use of several agonists and antagonists selective for the CCK receptor types, namely compound L-364,718, the Merck CCK antagonist selective for the peripheral CCK receptor (CCK-A), and compound L-365,260, the Merck CCK antagonist selective for the central CCK receptor (CCK-B). The CCK cyclic analogue recently developed in our laboratory that is highly selective for the CCK-B receptor (i.e., JMV320) also showed high affinity for the CCK receptor on the JURKAT cell line.

The highest doses administered were 80 (n = 1), 160 (n = 4), 320 (n = 8) and 640 U/kg (n = 1). One patient (refractory anemia with an excess of blasts, RAEB) showed an increase of hemoglobin, white blood cells and platelets with 80 U/kg rhEpo. However, this patient developed acute leukemia while on therapy. Two other patients (RAEB and RAEB in transformation) also transformed to acute leukemia. In the other 11 patients no response was observed. There was no correlation between in vitro culture data and in vivo responsiveness. The treatment was well tolerated and no nonhematological side effects were observed. From this study we conclude that rhEpo, even when given at high doses, has a low response rate in patients with MDS. Further investigation is needed in order to clarify whether rhEpo increases the potential risk of transformation to acute leukemia.","['Schouten, H C', 'Vellenga, E', 'van Rhenen, D J', 'de Wolf, J T', 'Coppens, P J', 'Blijham, G H']","['Schouten HC', 'Vellenga E', 'van Rhenen DJ', 'de Wolf JT', 'Coppens PJ', 'Blijham GH']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospital Maastricht, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Anemia, Refractory/blood/drug therapy', 'Anemia, Refractory, with Excess of Blasts/blood/drug therapy', 'Anemia, Sideroblastic/blood/drug therapy', 'Blood Platelets/drug effects', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects', 'Drug Evaluation', 'Erythrocytes/drug effects', 'Erythropoietin/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/blood', 'Female', 'Hemoglobins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukocytes/drug effects', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/blood/*drug therapy', 'Recombinant Proteins/administration & dosage/adverse effects/blood']",1991/05/01 00:00,1991/05/01 00:01,['1991/05/01 00:00'],"['1991/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1991 May;5(5):432-6.,"['0 (Hemoglobins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A total of 164 newly diagnosed patients were randomly assigned to either DNR or DHAD plus vincristine, prednisone and methotrexate given intravenously (i.v.) and interthecally (i.t.). Patients received four more intensification courses of chemotherapy and then all therapy was stopped. Central nervous system (CNS) prophylaxis consisted of nine infusions of intermediate dose methotrexate (MTX) and intrathecal MTX. DHAD and DNR were equally effective in producing complete remissions (63 and 65%, respectively). The estimated median remission duration is 10.2 and 12.3 months for the DHAD and DNR arms, respectively (p = 0.56). This study was stopped earlier than planned when it became apparent that remission duration for both arms was shorter than seen in our prior study in which all patients received more than 1 year of maintenance therapy. The estimated median survival is 18.3 and 20.6 months for the DHAD and DNR arms, respectively (p = 0.90). Younger patients and patients with a pre-treatment white blood count of less than 30,000/microliters had a significantly longer remission duration and survival. Eleven per cent of patients who achieved a complete remission have had a CNS relapse to date, which is not different from the rate in our prior study using cranial irradiation and i.t. MTX, implying that intermediate dose MTX with i.t. MTX may be as effective as cranial irradiation and i.t. MTX.

We have assessed the effect of bryostatin 1 on the in vitro clonogenic response of leukemic myeloblasts obtained from 12 patients with acute non-lymphocytic leukemia to recombinant granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (rGM-CSF), and have compared these responses to those of normal human hematopoietic progenitors. Although leukemic blast progenitors responded in a heterogenous manner to bryostatin 1 as a single agent, co-administration of 12.5 or 100 nM bryostatin 1 in conjunction with 1.25 ng/ml rGM-CSF resulted in a significant reduction in colony formation (compared to rGM-CSF alone) in 8/12 specimens, and sub-additive stimulatory effects in all samples. In addition, the exposure of cells to 12.5 nM bryostatin 1, either alone or in conjunction with 1.25 ng/ml rGM-CSF, substantially reduced or eliminated leukemic cell self-renewal capacity in all samples assayed. In contrast to the effects observed in leukemic cells, exposure of adherent and T-cell depleted normal bone marrow mononuclear cells to equivalent concentrations of bryostatin 1 and rGM-CSF consistently produced supra-additive effects on the growth of normal committed myeloid progenitors (day 14 CFU-GM). When normal marrow cells were further enriched for progenitors (MY-10+), concentrations of bryostatin 1 that were unable to support growth when administered alone significantly potentiated the number of GM colonies formed in response to rGM-CSF. These studies suggest that bryostatin 1 may modulate the in vitro response of certain normal and leukemic progenitor cells to rGM-CSF, and that the nature of this response differs between the two cell types. They also indicate that bryostatin 1 may be particularly effective in limiting the self-renewal capacity of leukemic myeloblasts, an in vitro characteristic with potentially important in vivo significance.","['Grant, S', 'Pettit, G R', 'Howe, C', 'McCrady, C']","['Grant S', 'Pettit GR', 'Howe C', 'McCrady C']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Medical College of Virginia, Richmond 23298-0230.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Antigens/immunology', 'Bryostatins', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/drug effects/immunology', 'Humans', 'Lactones/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/enzymology/pathology', 'Macrolides', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects/pathology', 'Phorbol 12,13-Dibutyrate/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase C/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1991/05/01 00:00,1991/05/01 00:01,['1991/05/01 00:00'],"['1991/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1991 May;5(5):392-8.,"['0 (Antigens)', '0 (Bryostatins)', '0 (Lactones)', '0 (Macrolides)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '37558-16-0 (Phorbol 12,13-Dibutyrate)', '37O2X55Y9E (bryostatin 1)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)']",,,,['2RO1CA35601-7/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,

These 28 cases were identified in a series of 260 consecutive acute leukemia cases occurring predominantly in adults and were subdivided into 18 cases of AMLL with myeloid morphology and cytochemistry (AMLL-AML) and 10 cases of AMLL with lymphoid morphology and cytochemistry (AMLL-ALL). A lack of correlation was observed between the expression of B- or T-cell associated antigens with the presence of the expected immunoglobulin (Ig) or T-cell receptor (TCR) gene rearrangements in the AMLL cases with myeloid morphology. Only three of the 18 total AMLL-AML cases, each co-expressing B- and myeloid-associated cell surface antigens (B/My), had Ig heavy chain gene rearrangements with or without rearrangements of TCR genes. Ig light chain genes remained in the germline configuration. Strikingly, these three cases were the only AMLL-AML cases in our series to have the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome translocation t(9;22)(q34;q11), suggesting that a significant percentage of acute leukemias with myeloid morphology and gene rearrangements may be Ph+ AMLL. The fact that three of the 10 B/My AMLL-AML cases in our series were Ph+ suggests that there may be an increased frequency of Ph chromosome, a translocation associated with a poor prognostic outcome, in B/My AMLL-AML occurring in the adult population. Although most AMLL cases with lymphoid morphology had Ig and TCR gene rearrangements associated with a variety of immunophenotypes and karyotypes, two Ph+ AMLL-ALL cases had many similar features (B/My immunophenotype; IgH with or without TCR rearrangements; Ig light chain genes germline) to their Ph+ AMLL-AML counterparts. However, the Ph+ AMLL-ALL cases differed from the Ph+ AMLL-AML cases by the expression of a more mature B-cell lineage immunophenotype and by their additional cytogenetic changes.","['Saikevych, I A', 'Kerrigan, D P', 'McConnell, T S', 'Head, D R', 'Appelbaum, F R', 'Willman, C L']","['Saikevych IA', 'Kerrigan DP', 'McConnell TS', 'Head DR', 'Appelbaum FR', 'Willman CL']","['Department of Pathology, University of New Mexico School of Medicine, Albuquerque.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Gene Rearrangement/genetics', 'Gene Rearrangement, T-Lymphocyte/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulins/*genetics', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Biphenotypic, Acute/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/classification/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Translocation, Genetic/*genetics']",1991/05/01 00:00,1991/05/01 00:01,['1991/05/01 00:00'],"['1991/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1991 May;5(5):373-82.,['0 (Immunoglobulins)'],,,,"['CA-12213/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-32734/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-37429/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

The activity of three elements of the stably integrated LTR was analyzed in undifferentiated EC cells (stable CAT assay). Results of the study are summarized as follows. (i) In the stable assay, the promoter region of the LTR was inactive in undifferentiated ECA2 and F9 cells, and the level of the activity was 10(-4) of that in NIH 3T3 cells. (ii) In contrast to the results of the transient assay, the enhancer was active in undifferentiated ECA2 cells and in F9 cells. It activated CAT activity more than 60-fold and about 8-fold in ECA2 cells and F9 cells, respectively. (iii) Suppression by ELP, the embryonal LTR-binding protein, was more pronounced in the stable assay than in the transient assay. These data suggest that, when compared with NIH 3T3 cells, a major factor for the inactivity of the LTR in EC cells is the inefficiency of the promoter in this assay. Transcriptional activity of the LTR was analyzed during the differentiation of EC cells. In the case of ECA2 cells, the magnitude of activation by the enhancer did not change during differentiation. The activity of the promoter increased about 10-fold, and the suppression by ELP became negligible 4 days after the induction of differentiation. Upon differentiation of F9 cells, the activity of the enhancer increased more than 300-fold, but the promoter remained inactive. The pattern of LTR-binding proteins also varied during the differentiation of EC cells. Our present data suggest that the activity of LTR elements as assayed by the stable assay differs from the activity as assayed by the transient assay. It also indicates that the activity of these elements exhibits cell-type-specific changes during the differentiation of EC cells.","['Tsukiyama, T', 'Niwa, O', 'Yokoro, K']","['Tsukiyama T', 'Niwa O', 'Yokoro K']","['Department of Pathology, Hiroshima University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Plasmids', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', '*Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Teratoma/*genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1991/06/01 00:00,1991/06/01 00:01,['1991/06/01 00:00'],"['1991/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.65.6.2979-2986.1991 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1991 Jun;65(6):2979-86. doi: 10.1128/JVI.65.6.2979-2986.1991.,['EC 2.3.1.28 (Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase)'],,['CAT'],,,PMC240943,,,,,,,,,,,

Since individual clinicians usually have a preference, most trials could be judged unethical according to this line of argument. A recent important article in the New England Journal of Medicine argued that individual preferences are not as important as the collective uncertainty of informed clinicians. If clinicians are equally divided, there is a state of collective equipoise and a trial is ethical. However, clinicians will seldom be exactly equally divided. We conducted an ethometric study to find out how much collective equipoise can be disturbed before the potential subjects in a trial think that it is unethical. Half of our subjects perceived a trial as unethical when equipoise was disturbed beyond 70:30. In other words, when 70 per cent of experts favour one treatment, 50 per cent of subjects would prefer that treatment to be administered rather than subjected to critical assessment. When equipoise is disturbed beyond 80:20, less than 3 per cent of subjects would consider human trials morally justifiable.","['Johnson, N', 'Lilford, R J', 'Brazier, W']","['Johnson N', 'Lilford RJ', 'Brazier W']","[""Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, St James's University Hospital.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Med Ethics,Journal of medical ethics,7513619,IM,"['Aged', 'Animal Experimentation', 'Animals', 'Attitude of Health Personnel', 'Clinical Trials as Topic/*standards', 'Ethics Committees, Research', '*Ethics, Medical', 'Headache/drug therapy', 'Human Experimentation', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Pneumonia/prevention & control', 'Research Design', '*Research Subjects', '*Risk Assessment', '*Uncertainty']",1991/03/01 00:00,1991/03/01 00:01,['1991/03/01 00:00'],"['1991/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/jme.17.1.30 [doi]'],ppublish,J Med Ethics. 1991 Mar;17(1):30-4. doi: 10.1136/jme.17.1.30.,,,,,,PMC1375968,,,,,['KIE: 33271'],,,['KIE'],"['Analytical Approach', 'Biomedical and Behavioral Research', 'Empirical Approach']","['KIE: KIE BoB Subject Heading: human experimentation/research design', 'KIE: Full author name: Johnson, Nicholas', 'KIE: Full author name: Lilford, Richard J', 'KIE: Full author name: Brazier, Wayne']",

The compounds were much more cytotoxic than the parent diols, and were also at least 10-fold more cytotoxic than the corresponding aniline mustards themselves. Comparative cell line studies suggested that the mechanism of cytotoxicity varied with mustard reactivity. The most reactive mustards cross-linked DNA, while cell killing by the less reactive compounds appeared to be by the formation of bulky monoadducts. The compounds were active but not particularly dose-potent against P388 leukemia in vivo. The modest potency may be related to their poor aqueous solubility, since the more soluble methyl quaternary salts were equally active at much lower doses.","['Gravatt, G L', 'Baguley, B C', 'Wilson, W R', 'Denny, W A']","['Gravatt GL', 'Baguley BC', 'Wilson WR', 'Denny WA']","['Department of Pathology, University of Auckland School of Medicine, New Zealand.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry,9716531,IM,"['Alkylating Agents/*chemical synthesis/therapeutic use', 'Aniline Mustard/*analogs & derivatives', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*chemical synthesis/therapeutic use', 'Cell Line', 'DNA/*metabolism', 'Leukemia P388/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Solubility', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",1991/05/01 00:00,1991/05/01 00:01,['1991/05/01 00:00'],"['1991/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/jm00109a005 [doi]'],ppublish,J Med Chem. 1991 May;34(5):1552-60. doi: 10.1021/jm00109a005.,"['0 (Alkylating Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'CUJ6745Z9J (Aniline Mustard)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A lymphoblastoid cell line carrying the 22q- derivative chromosome product of the constitutional t(11;22) translocation was used as the source of chromosomes. Synthetic oligonucleotide primers, based on the consensus Alu sequence, were used to amplify inter-Alu sequence from 500 flow-sorted 22q- derivative chromosomes. The amplified sequences were cloned into a plasmid vector by blunt-end ligation, yielding clones with inserts in the range of 400 to 1000 bp. Approximately 70% of these clones hybridized to human DNA as single-copy probes. To identify clones derived from chromosome 11, the library was screened with a heterogeneous probe prepared by Alu-PCR amplification from the DNA of a somatic cell hybrid containing one homology of chromosome 11. All the positive clones found were mapped to within the q23-q25 region of chromosome 11 known to be translocated onto the 22q- derivative chromosome. Further mapping studies showed that most of these probes (7/8) lay between the breakpoints for the t(4;11) translocation of acute lymphocytic leukemia and the t(11;22) of Ewing sarcoma. Thus, the use of Alu-PCR on the small derivative chromosome 22q- has provided a greatly enriched source of probes to region 11q23, a part of the genome that is currently of great interest. This approach will be particularly appropriate to small numbers of chromosomes when high specificity rather than total representation is required.","['Cotter, F E', 'Das, S', 'Douek, E', 'Carter, N P', 'Young, B D']","['Cotter FE', 'Das S', 'Douek E', 'Carter NP', 'Young BD']","[""ICRF Department of Medical Oncology, St. Bartholomew's Hospital, London, England.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Genomics,Genomics,8800135,IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Cell Line', 'Chromosome Mapping', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Consensus Sequence', '*DNA Probes', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Amplification', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Translocation, Genetic/genetics']",1991/03/01 00:00,1991/03/01 00:01,['1991/03/01 00:00'],"['1991/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0888-7543(91)90413-9 [pii]', '10.1016/0888-7543(91)90413-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Genomics. 1991 Mar;9(3):473-80. doi: 10.1016/0888-7543(91)90413-9.,"['0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Golgi complexes were extensively disorganized by BFA. Within 5 min, most stacked cisternae were converted to vesicles scattered throughout the centrosphere region. By 30 min, the Golgi complexes were completely disassembled. Only clusters of small vesicles (""Golgi remnants"") persisted in the vicinity of the centrioles and microtubule-organizing centers. Some of these small vesicles had a simple coat structure on their membranes. Over the next 1 to 2 h of BFA treatment, the number of vesicles in the Golgi area decreased concomitantly with the expansion of a predominantly smooth membrane portion of the ER, consisting of a network of dilated tubules in continuity with regular RER cisternae, annulate lamellae and the nuclear envelope. By electron microscopy, viral glycoproteins appeared to accumulate on the membranes of this network, and immature virions were found to bud preferentially into its cisternal space. Viral accumulations increased with time under BFA. The rest of the RER appeared normal, apparently unaffected by the drug. Preferential virion budding suggests that this expanding network is a chemically differentiated part of the ER. By immunofluorescence, antibodies to viral envelope proteins gave a punctate staining at the surface of control cells, presumably in the areas of virion budding, whereas relatively large intracellular masses of antigens were found in BFA-treated cells. We assume that these masses represent the differentiated parts of the ER. Taken together, these findings suggest that BFA blocks intracellular transport of newly synthesized cellular and viral proteins immediately distal to the distinct compartment of the ER in which virion budding preferentially occurs. BFA effects are rapidly and fully reversible. Within 1 min of the removal of the drug, stacks of Golgi cisternae began to reappear in the vicinity of the centrioles, and by 30 min, Golgi complexes regained their normal structural appearance.","['Ulmer, J B', 'Palade, G E']","['Ulmer JB', 'Palade GE']","['Department of Cell Biology, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Germany,Eur J Cell Biol,European journal of cell biology,7906240,IM,"['Animals', 'Antiviral Agents/*pharmacology', 'Brefeldin A', 'Cyclopentanes/*pharmacology', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum/*drug effects/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Golgi Apparatus/*drug effects/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Retroviridae/drug effects/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*drug effects/metabolism/ultrastructure']",1991/02/01 00:00,1991/02/01 00:01,['1991/02/01 00:00'],"['1991/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Eur J Cell Biol. 1991 Feb;54(1):38-54.,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Cyclopentanes)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '20350-15-6 (Brefeldin A)']",,,,['1 PO1 CA 46128-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Ph1 and the resulting BCR-ABL fused genes are markers for this type of leukemia. The product of the fused BCR-ABL genes is a protein of about 2000 amino acids termed P210 BCR-ABL. Although the BCR-ABL protein can be routinely detected in blood cells from blast crisis CML patients by assaying for its activated tyrosine kinase activity, detection of P210 BCR-ABL in early stage CML patients (chronic phase) has not yet been possible (S. A. Maxwell et al., Cancer Res., 47: 1731, 1987). A procedure involving Western blotting with an anti-ABL monoclonal antibody was developed that allows detection of P210 BCR-ABL and P145 ABL in cells from chronic phase and blast crisis CML patients, but as expected only P145 ABL was found in normal white blood cells. Most chronic phase patients also contained one to two ABL proteins with a molecular weight of about 190,000. Interestingly, the ratio of BCR-ABL to ABL proteins increased in four blast crisis patients compared to 18 chronic phase patients. Also, one chronic phase patient analyzed on three separate occasions lacked P210 BCR-ABL and exhibited only the Mr 190,000 form.

At sacrifice 61 weeks after the first injection the incidences of malignant mammary tumors were increased significantly to 45 and 24% in the 4-nitropyrene- and N-hydroxy-N-acetyl-2-aminofluorene-treated groups, respectively. Cellular altered foci in the liver were increased significantly in the N-acetyl-1-aminopyrene-, N-hydroxy-N-acetyl-1-aminopyrene-, and N-hydroxy-N-acetyl-2-aminofluorene- treated groups; the latter two compounds also led to significantly increased formation of hyperplastic nodules in this organ. Significant increases in leukemia induction were observed in animals treated with 2-nitropyrene or N-hydroxy-N-acetyl-2-aminofluorene. In an experiment designed to compare the influence of the route of administration on the carcinogenic potential of this agent, 1-nitropyrene was injected i.p. or s.c. into weanling female CD rats (100 mumol/kg body weight; once a week for 4 weeks). The animals were sacrificed at 87 to 90 weeks after the first treatment. The incidences of mammary gland tumors in animals receiving injections of 1-nitropyrene by either route (59%) were significantly higher than in solvent-injected controls (37%). The incidences of adenocarcinoma in the i.p. 1-nitropyrene group (28%) and fibroadenoma in the s.c. 1-nitropyrene group (52%) were significantly higher than in the control animals (7 and 27%, respectively). These data suggest that the demonstration of the weak carcinogenicity of 1-nitropyrene is probably more a function of the length of the observation period than of the routes of administration used here. A further exploration of the effect of the route of administration involved treatment of weanling female CD rats by direct injection of 1-, 2-, or 4-nitropyrene into the mammary fat pads. A total of 2.04 mumol of the nitrocompound in dimethyl sulfoxide was injected into the mammary glands under each of the 6 left nipples. The right mammary glands were treated with the solvent only.

Recent molecular studies concerning their structure and origin showed that many translocations occur in early precursor B cells and may be interpreted as aberrant immunoglobulin gene rearrangements. The available data from in vitro experiments, transgenic mice, and normal human individuals indicate that these translocations are essential but insufficient for full tumorigenesis. The consequent ""multi-hit"" concept might have important implications for the detection of minimal residual disease using the polymerase chain reaction for these translocations. The strong associations with specific types of lymphomas underline their differences in histogenetic origin. Thus, based on differences in bcl-1 and bcl-2 rearrangements, molecular analysis may help to distinguish follicular lymphoma from diffuse centrocytic lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia.

In spite of extensive clinical and experimental investigations, its intracellular metabolism and especially its mechanism of action are still not fully elucidated. Controversy also continues about the most appropriate way and dose of administration; which differs by more than 100 fold in clinical studies ranging from low-dose, over standard and intermediate dose regimens, to high-dose protocols. The present review is focused on the role and place of high-dose AraC treatment in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Based on available clinical and experimental data, the following conclusions can be drawn: Not considering possible but not yet demonstrated beneficial long-term effects, the incorporation of high-dose AraC into induction therapy has not resulted in an improvement of overall remission rate, with the possible exception of patients with slow initial cytoreduction after a first course of conventional treatment. Promising results, however, emerge from high-dose AraC-based consolidation protocols, which need confirmation in prospectively randomized comparative trials. In relapsed and refractory AML, higher than conventional doses undoubtedly enhance the efficacy of AraC salvage therapy. The question of whether the antileukemic activity of intermediate-dose regimens with 500-1,000 mg/m2 AraC is equivalent to that of high-dose protocols applying 2,000-3,000 mg/m2 AraC, however, remains open but may soon be answered by ongoing controlled clinical and pharmacologic investigations.","['Hiddemann, W']",['Hiddemann W'],"['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Munster, Federal Republic of Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,IM,"['Cytarabine/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Recurrence']",1991/04/01 00:00,1991/04/01 00:01,['1991/04/01 00:00'],"['1991/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF01702925 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 1991 Apr;62(4):119-28. doi: 10.1007/BF01702925.,['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)'],123,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These findings support the clinical impression that after 1980 an important therapeutic difference resulting from the new United Kingdom acute lymphoblastic leukaemia protocols was an increase in the amount of 6-mercaptopurine that children actually received as a result of changes in prescribing guidelines rather than dose.

Besides these 4 aspirates with hairy cells with ring-shaped nuclei we found one or two such hairy cells in 5 other bone marrow aspirates and in one puncture from the spleen of another patient but with a low frequency between 2/5000 and 1/16,000. We found hairy cells with ring-shaped nuclei in all aspirates from 2 of 30 patients (7%) while at least one such cell was found in 8 patients (27%) with HCL. Neutrophil bands with a bent nucleus and its overlapping ends, simulating ring-shaped nuclei but with easily recognizable edges of overlapping ends, were found with a frequency of about 1 per mille of all nucleated bone marrow cells in 18 aspirates of 11 patients with HCL.","['Lemez, P']",['Lemez P'],"['Ustav hematologie a krevni transfuze, Praha.']",['cze'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Czech Republic,Vnitr Lek,Vnitrni lekarstvi,0413602,IM,"['Bone Marrow/*ultrastructure', 'Cell Nucleus/*ultrastructure', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*pathology', 'Spleen/pathology']",1991/03/01 00:00,1991/03/01 00:01,['1991/03/01 00:00'],"['1991/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Vnitr Lek. 1991 Mar;37(3):275-8.,,,,Vyskyt bunek s prstencitymi jadry u leukemii s vlasatymi bunkami.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The cellular homolog of v-cbl has been identified in mouse and human DNA, and was recently mapped to mouse chromosome 9 and human chromosome 11q23. To determine the coding sequences of the human and mouse c-cbl proto-oncogenes cDNA clones were isolated from libraries prepared from the human T cell leukemia lines CCRF-CEM and HUT 78, and the mouse pre-B cell line 70Z/3. DNA sequencing revealed an open reading frame encoding 906 amino acids in the human cDNAs and 896 amino acids in 70Z/3. The sequence showed that v-cbl is a markedly truncated form of murine c-cbl containing 355 N-terminal amino acids. The nucleotide sequence of v-cbl is identical to murine c-cbl in this region, and the human sequence has only five amino acid changes in the v-cbl portion. The most notable features of the sequence which was lost in the generation of v-cbl is a C-terminal leucine zipper and a stretch of 208 amino acids containing 23% proline and 19% serine/threonine residues. This proline-rich sequence has similarities to the transcriptional activation domains of some transcription factors, and v-cbl's transforming potential may be due to the loss of this region and the leucine zipper.","['Blake, T J', 'Shapiro, M', 'Morse, H C 3rd', 'Langdon, W Y']","['Blake TJ', 'Shapiro M', 'Morse HC 3rd', 'Langdon WY']","['Division of Human Immunology, Institute of Medical and Veterinary Science, Adelaide, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Gene Library', 'Humans', 'Leucine Zippers/genetics', 'Mice/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oncogene Protein v-cbl', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-cbl', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/*genetics', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Transformation, Genetic', '*Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases']",1991/04/01 00:00,1991/04/01 00:01,['1991/04/01 00:00'],"['1991/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncogene. 1991 Apr;6(4):653-7.,"['0 (Oncogene Protein v-cbl)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-cbl)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 6.3.2.- (CBL protein, human)', 'EC 6.3.2.- (Cbl protein, mouse)']",,,,,,,"['GENBANK/X57110', 'GENBANK/X57111']",,,,,,,,,

There was significant inhibition of both the natural killer activity and the lectin dependent cellular cytotoxicity of the normal donor lymphocytes compared to when incubation took place in autologous or normal allogeneic sera or marrow supernatant. This inhibition was time-related and partially reversible by washing of the normal lymphocytes immediately before the cytotoxicity assay. The suppressor factor, however, did not inhibit the IL-2 induced lymphocyte proliferation or affect the cytotoxicity-linked cytoplasmic serine esterase expression in the normal lymphocytes. This suppressor phenomenon was of myeloblast origin. Chronic exposure to the tumour-derived suppressor factor may be responsible for the impaired cellular cytotoxic functions observed in patients with acute myeloid leukaemia. It may also suppress the in vivo cytotoxic functions of IL-2 activated lymphocytes in patients treated with recombinant IL-2, hence leading to the disappointing results of immunotherapy so often encountered in clinical setting.","['Lim, S H', 'Worman, C P', 'Jewell, A', 'Goldstone, A H']","['Lim SH', 'Worman CP', 'Jewell A', 'Goldstone AH']","['Department of Haematology, University College Hospital, London, U.K.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,IM,"['Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Esterases/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*immunology/metabolism', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphocytes/enzymology/immunology', 'Suppressor Factors, Immunologic/*biosynthesis', 'Time Factors']",1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0145-2126(91)90129-h [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Res. 1991;15(4):263-8. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(91)90129-h.,"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Suppressor Factors, Immunologic)', 'EC 3.1.- (Esterases)', 'EC 3.1.- (serine esterase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The transport of ara-C in P388/VCR cell line was a 1.4-fold increase at 30 sec compared to that in P388 parent cell line (P less than 0.01). The increase of the transport of ara-C in P388/VCR cell line, however, was not completely abolished by the nucleoside transport inhibitor, nitrobenzylthioinosine (NBTI) to the level in parent cell line. Scatchard analyses revealed that the resistant cells had significantly less NBTI binding sites than the parent cells had. These results suggested that the changes in ara-C transport in P388/VCR cells were due, in part, to increase of NBTI-insensitive transport sites in the membrane. The measurement of the intracellular ara-CTP concentration by high-performance liquid chromatography revealed that the intracellular ara-CTP level in P388/VCR cells was also significantly higher than that in parent cells (1.4-fold, P less than 0.01). As the transport of ara-C is rate limiting at a concentration of 1 microM in the both cell lines, we concluded that the accumulation of ara-CTP in P388/VCR cells might have partially resulted from the enhancement of the ara-C transport.","['Higashigawa, M', 'Ido, M', 'Kuwabara, H', 'Hori, H', 'Ohkubo, T', 'Kawasaki, H', 'Sakurai, M', 'Taniguchi, K', 'Hamazaki, M']","['Higashigawa M', 'Ido M', 'Kuwabara H', 'Hori H', 'Ohkubo T', 'Kawasaki H', 'Sakurai M', 'Taniguchi K', 'Hamazaki M']","['Department of Pediatrics, Mie University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,IM,"['Animals', 'Arabinofuranosylcytosine Triphosphate/*pharmacokinetics', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Transport/drug effects', 'Cell Membrane/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cytarabine/*pharmacokinetics', 'Drug Resistance', 'Leukemia P388/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Thioinosine/analogs & derivatives/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism', 'Vincristine/*pharmacology']",1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0145-2126(91)90128-g [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Res. 1991;15(4):255-62. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(91)90128-g.,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '13191-15-6 (Arabinofuranosylcytosine Triphosphate)', '46S541971T (Thioinosine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'GV1L2DZM2Z (4-nitrobenzylthioinosine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our studies demonstrated that A-LAK was superior in its oncolytic activity (tested in a 3-h 51Cr release assay) to conventionally prepared (LAK) and non-adherent (NA) IL-2 cultures. No activity was observed by this highly oncolytic subset against normal bone marrow (BM). A-LAK also displayed highest proliferative activity in 7-11 day cultures (5- to 58-fold expansion) in comparison to LAK (0.7- to 2.7-fold) or NA (1.0- to 2.6-fold) cultures. Analysis of phenotype of unseparated, NA and adherent (A-LAK) lymphocytes 24 h after IL-2 activation showed that the A-LAK was composed predominantly of high intensity (bright) CD11a+ (LFA-1) lymphocytes (75 +/- 4.8%) when compared to the other two populations (12 +/- 2.1%). Similarly, A-LAK contained higher proportion of CD11b (CR3 receptor)-positive lymphocytes (39 +/- 2.1%) than unseparated and NA lymphocytes (11 +/- 1.4%). Double marker phenotypic studies showed that A-LAK cultures were heterogeneous and distribution of individual lymphocyte subsets differed among NLL patients. While in A-LAK culture of some patients the CD56+, CD3- natural killer (NK) cell subset was predominant, CD3+, CD56- lymphocyte subset was prevalent in others. Highest A-LAK lytic activity was always correlated with highest NK cell content. Characterization studies (using the complement-depletion technique) showed that independently of the distribution of lymphocytes in A-LAK cultures, CD16+, CD56+, CD3- NK cell subset displayed highest oncolytic effect. CD5+ subset also participated in cytotoxic function. These observations indicated that A-LAK may represent a new therapeutic approach to treatment of leukemia.","['Lotzova, E', 'Savary, C A', 'Totpal, K', 'Schachner, J', 'Lichtiger, B', 'McCredie, K B', 'Freireich, E J']","['Lotzova E', 'Savary CA', 'Totpal K', 'Schachner J', 'Lichtiger B', 'McCredie KB', 'Freireich EJ']","['Department of General Surgery, University of Texas, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,IM,"['Adult', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', '*Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Interleukin-2/therapeutic use', 'Killer Cells, Lymphokine-Activated/immunology/pathology/*transplantation', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology/*therapy', 'Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1/metabolism', 'Macrophage-1 Antigen/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/pathology']",1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0145-2126(91)90127-f [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Res. 1991;15(4):245-54. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(91)90127-f.,"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1)', '0 (Macrophage-1 Antigen)']",,,,['CA 39632/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Murine leukemia cells resistant to cytosine arabinoside (ara-C) due to a deletion of deoxycytidine kinase are collaterally sensitive to DAUrd, which inhibits the de novo production of CTP and hence results in dCTP depletion. We evaluated DAUrd in combination with the palmitate derivative of ara-C (palmO-ara-C) in mice bearing L1210 leukemia cells with a subpopulation resistant to ara-C. Both simultaneous administration and a sequential schedule of palmO-ara-C at its maximally tolerated dose (MTD), followed by DAUrd treatment, failed to produce a therapeutic gain. We also studied whether non-toxic doses of DAUrd (15-250 mg/kg i.p. at h 0 and 6 on days 4 and 8) could modulate the antileukemic activity of palmO-ara-C (7.5-120 mg/kg i.p. at h 3 on days 4 and 8). The addition of DAUrd produced a modest (but statistically significant) prolongation of life span and a further 2-log10 reduction in tumor burden compared to the same dose of palmO-ara-C alone, and resulted in long-term survivors in five of 30 treated animals. Two-dimensional dose-response analysis of the survival data indicated a positive drug interaction (p less than or equal to 0.01) when the dosage of DAUrd was modeled to reflect an apparent threshold effect. Cyclopentenyl cytosine (CPE-C; 0.625-2.5 mg/kg i.p. at h 0 and 6 on days 4 and 8), a more potent inhibitor of CTP synthetase, was also given with palmO-ara-C. This combination resulted in an additional 2-6 log10 units of cell kill and occasional long-term survivors at palmO-ara-C dosages that alone resulted in no more than 2 log10 units of cell kill and no long-term survivors. However, DAUrd and CPE-C given with palmO-ara-C increased host toxicity, compromising the tolerable dose of palmO-ara-C. Single-agent palmO-ara-C given at its MTD produced a similar reduction in tumor burden and increase in life span compared to the highest palmO-ara-C dose that could be given in combination with either modulator.","['Grem, J L', 'Plowman, J', 'Rubinstein, L', 'Hawkins, M J', 'Harrison, S D Jr']","['Grem JL', 'Plowman J', 'Rubinstein L', 'Hawkins MJ', 'Harrison SD Jr']","['Medicine Branch, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD 20892.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,IM,"['3-Deazauridine/administration & dosage', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives', 'Cytidine/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives', 'Drug Resistance', 'Drug Synergism', 'Female', 'Leukemia L1210/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Rate']",1991/01/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0145-2126(91)90125-d [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Res. 1991;15(4):229-36. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(91)90125-d.,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '263CU738ZY (3-Deazauridine)', '5CSZ8459RP (Cytidine)', '69MO0NDN8K (cyclopentenyl cytosine)', ""O57A51JE0D (5'-palmitoyl cytarabine)""]",,,,['N01-CM-67724/CM/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Although in vitro the tumour cells were stimulated by MoAb anti-id no signs of tumour cell activation were observed in vivo during therapy with MoAb anti-id. The rapid tumour reduction suggests that the proliferation-enhancing property of anti-id is not a contra-indication for immunotherapy. The FcR II receptors on the patients monocytes could interact with the IgG1 monoclonal used. MoAb anti-id administration induced strongly decreased platelet counts, dependent on the amount of serum idiotype that had to be cleared. Antibody administration activated the macrophage/monocyte system, reflected in the neopterin profile, resulting in TNF alpha production and simultaneously strong reductions of circulating tumour cells. The partial remission lasted 3 months, then the tumour reappeared.

In three of the cell lines (HL-60, K-562, and CCRF-CEM), co-administration of 20 or 50 microM dCyd with 10 microM ara-C reduced ara-CTP formation by at least 90% and incorporation of ara-C into DNA by at least 80%. In contrast, KG-1 cells exhibited substantially smaller reductions in both ara-CTP formation and incorporation of ara-C into DNA under identical conditions. KG-1 cells were distinguished by the highest activity of the enzyme cytidine deaminase of the four lines assayed, and exhibited the smallest increments in the intracellular accumulation of both dCyd and deoxycytidine triphosphate (dCTP) in response to exogenous dCyd. Co-administration of 1 mM tetrahydrouridine (THU) or 0.5 mM deoxy-tetrahydrouridine (dTHU) had little effect on the ability of dCyd to antagonize ara-C metabolism in HL-60, KG-1 and K-562 cells. In contrast, these deaminase inhibitors substantially increased the intracellular accumulation of dCTP as well as the ability of dCyd to antagonize ara-CTP formation and incorporation of ara-C into DNA in KG-1 cells. THU and dTHU also permitted dCyd to antagonize ara-C growth inhibitory effects in KG-1 cells to the extent observed in the other leukemic cell lines. These studies suggest that the intracellular deamination of exogenous deoxycytidine may influence the degree to which this nucleoside antagonizes ara-C metabolism and toxicity in some leukemic cells. They also raise the possibility that deaminase inhibitors may be employed to modulate, and perhaps to improve, the therapeutic selectivity of pharmacologically relevant concentrations of ara-C and dCyd in the treatment of acute leukemia in man.","['Grant, S', 'Bhalla, K', 'McCrady, C']","['Grant S', 'Bhalla K', 'McCrady C']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Medical College of Virginia, Richmond 23298.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,IM,"['Arabinofuranosylcytosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cytarabine/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Cytidine Deaminase/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'DCMP Deaminase/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'DNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Deamination', 'Deoxycytidine/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Deoxycytosine Nucleotides/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/metabolism/*pathology', 'Tetrahydrouridine/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism/pathology']",1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0145-2126(91)90122-a [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Res. 1991;15(4):205-13. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(91)90122-a.,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Deoxycytosine Nucleotides)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '0W860991D6 (Deoxycytidine)', '13191-15-6 (Arabinofuranosylcytosine Triphosphate)', '18771-50-1 (Tetrahydrouridine)', ""2056-98-6 (2'-deoxycytidine 5'-triphosphate)"", ""31962-88-6 (2'-deoxytetrahydrouridine)"", 'EC 3.5.4.12 (DCMP Deaminase)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (Cytidine Deaminase)']",,,,['2-RO1-CA-35601/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,

In 31 of the 40 patients the numbers of megakaryocytes were increased which was associated with a predominance of smaller cell forms (micromegakaryocytes). Compared with periodic acid Schiff, immunostaining with a formalin resistant monoclonal antibody against glycoprotein IIIa (Y2/51(CD61) showed a clinically important proportion of immature elements. These could be designated pro- and megakaryoblasts by taking morphometric measurements on smears and bone marrow sections. There was a relevant increase in the number of promegakaryoblasts in 32 patients, consistent with uncontrolled expansion of the precursor pool. Seventeen repeated bone marrow biopsy specimens taken after chemotherapy largely showed a decrease in the numbers of megakaryocytes including the precursor cell population. Moreover, morphometric evaluation disclosed that micromegakaryocytes in MDS differ significantly from those in chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) due to distinctive nuclear features and a disturbed nuclear:cytoplasmic ratio. These changes generate a more pleomorphic or atypical appearance of this cell population in MDS, compared with micromegakaryocytes in CML. It is concluded that the disproportionate increase in megakaryocyte precursors and the grossly abnormal aspects of micromegakaryocytes in MDS are characteristics of the severe defect involving haematopoiesis in this disorder.","['Thiele, J', 'Quitmann, H', 'Wagner, S', 'Fischer, R']","['Thiele J', 'Quitmann H', 'Wagner S', 'Fischer R']","['Institute of Pathology, University of Cologne, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Clin Pathol,Journal of clinical pathology,0376601,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Biopsy', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Female', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Male', 'Megakaryocytes/*pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*pathology']",1991/04/01 00:00,1991/04/01 00:01,['1991/04/01 00:00'],"['1991/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/jcp.44.4.300 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Pathol. 1991 Apr;44(4):300-5. doi: 10.1136/jcp.44.4.300.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)']",,,,,PMC496903,,,,,,,,,,,

On the basis of a number of studies, it is shown how, building on the experience obtained in earlier trials, the curative and palliative effects of such treatments can be improved.

The prevalence of chronic HBV infection was 41.5% (60/145). The prevalence of HDV infection among these patients with chronic HBV infection was 50% (30/60). Eighty-five patients were HBsAg-negative. There was evidence that HDV-infected children had more severe chronic liver disease than did HBsAg-positive, anti-HDV-negative patients: (1) their serum ALT levels were significantly more likely to be elevated at long-term follow-up (27/30 vs. 10/26, p = 0.0001); (2) their mean ALT levels were significantly higher 3 years after the cessation of chemotherapy (128 vs. 84 IU/L, p = 0.001); and (3) they were more likely to have either chronic acute hepatitis or cirrhosis when liver biopsy was done (18/23 vs. 6/18, p = 0.0038). Children who were HBsAg-negative had the lowest alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels and were least likely to have chronic active hepatitis or cirrhosis (3/31). We conclude that infection with HDV in children with ALL is associated with serious chronic liver disease. In long-term survivors, HDV infection is a major cause of morbidity and an adverse prognostic factor in terms of leukemia-free survival.","['Rossetti, F', 'Zancan, L', 'Bonato, M G', 'Quaranta, E', 'Rosolen, A', 'Rugge, M', 'Zanesco, L']","['Rossetti F', 'Zancan L', 'Bonato MG', 'Quaranta E', 'Rosolen A', 'Rugge M', 'Zanesco L']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Padua, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Pediatric hematology and oncology,8700164,IM,"['Antibodies, Viral/analysis', 'Aspartate Aminotransferases/blood', 'Child', 'Hepatitis B Surface Antigens/analysis', 'Hepatitis B e Antigens/analysis', 'Hepatitis D/*complications/prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Liver/pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications']",1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/08880019109033424 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 1991 Jan-Mar;8(1):23-32. doi: 10.3109/08880019109033424.,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Hepatitis B Surface Antigens)', '0 (Hepatitis B e Antigens)', 'EC 2.6.1.1 (Aspartate Aminotransferases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The study group comprised healthy children selected at GP surgeries (n = 136) and those hospitalized for both minor and serious conditions (n = 168). The results evaluate the entire study group for the pattern of reporting vaccinations and infectious episodes under three years of age, comparing two different data sources-mothers' reports and GP records. Maternal recall accuracy is formally tested (Kappa statistic) for agreement with GP records. For vaccination history the results indicate that mothers and GPs are inadequate data sources, and suggest use of computerized health district records to improve data accuracy. Major differences on infectious history were evident for two types of questions-closed for specific infections and open-ended for 'other infections'. Specific infections (e.g. measles) were systematically over-reported by mothers compared with GP records, but mothers failed to 'time' the event. Concordance for 'other infections' was also poor, but, by contrast, GPs systematically over-recorded this range of infections, indicating substantial inaccuracy in mothers' recall. The authors suggest that GP records should be the preferred source of data for these 'other' infectious episodes, especially under one year of age. Improved questionnaire design would elicit more accurate maternal reports on specified infections for which a GP may well not be consulted and corroboration would be impossible.","['McKinney, P A', 'Alexander, F E', 'Nicholson, C', 'Cartwright, R A', 'Carrette, J']","['McKinney PA', 'Alexander FE', 'Nicholson C', 'Cartwright RA', 'Carrette J']","['Leukaemia Research Fund Centre for Clinical Epidemiology, Leeds.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Public Health Med,Journal of public health medicine,9011205,IM,"['Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Family Practice', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Infections', 'Male', 'Medical Records', '*Mental Recall', 'Mothers/*psychology', 'Reproducibility of Results', '*Vaccination']",1991/02/01 00:00,1991/02/01 00:01,['1991/02/01 00:00'],"['1991/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/oxfordjournals.pubmed.a042571 [doi]'],ppublish,J Public Health Med. 1991 Feb;13(1):13-22. doi: 10.1093/oxfordjournals.pubmed.a042571.,,,,,,,['J Public Health Med. 1991 Nov;13(4):342.

These adverse drug reactions usually manifest as abnormal peripheral blood cell counts, which are usually low, involving one or more cell lines, but which may sometimes be raised as in drug-induced eosinophilia. Antineoplastic cytotoxic therapy, predictably, gives rise to cytopenias, which constitute the bulk of adverse haematological changes encountered in hospital practice. This paper addresses itself primarily to the unpredictable class of drug reactions which keeps the clinician vigilant. Its emphasis is on the clinical aspects and pathogenetic mechanisms of these iatrogenic haematological complications. Differences in tissue pattern of reaction to the same drug and the wide range of unrelated drugs capable of inducing a similar haematological aberration emphasises the role of individual susceptibility as the single most important factor in adverse drug reactions. Clarification of the pathogenetic mechanisms of different adverse drug reactions will ultimately come from the fields of pharmacogenetic and molecular genetics.","['Kueh, Y K']",['Kueh YK'],"['Department of Medicine, National University of Singapore.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Singapore,Ann Acad Med Singap,"Annals of the Academy of Medicine, Singapore",7503289,IM,"['Agranulocytosis/chemically induced', 'Anemia/chemically induced', 'Eosinophilia/chemically induced', 'Hematologic Diseases/*chemically induced', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/chemically induced', 'Thrombocytopenia/chemically induced']",1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Ann Acad Med Singap. 1991 Jan;20(1):106-13.,,41,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, some authors have suggested that EL is part of a spectrum of eosinophilic diseases termed hypereosinophilic syndrome (HS). EL diagnosis is very difficult, especially if abnormal chromosome are not present, because HS comprises multiple disease entities of unclear etiology with the common features of prolonged eosinophilia of undetectable cause and organ system dysfunction. We present a case of HS whose findings are consistent with a leukemic process. For two years the patient showed only sharp hypereosinophilia; his clinical course was then marked by signs and symptoms of granulocytic sarcoma (GS), an extramedullary tumor composed of granulocytic precursor cells. GS as a complication of EL was described and in some cases the diagnosis of leukemia was made only on the basis of the GS complication. The formation of eosinophilic GS also suggests a diagnosis of LE in our case of HS.

The patients, 5 men and 2 women aged 14-66 years (average: 45), were studied by means of small bowel enema and CT. Using small bowel enema, our findings were: masses related to a loop, stenosis, mucosal patterns with thick, irregular, and nodular folds, and bowel walls thickening. In nearly all cases CT showed not only small bowel lesions but also mesenteric lymphadenopathy. Five of seven patients had lymphomas, 1 had IP-SID lymphoma (immunoproliferative small intestinal disease related lymphoma), and 1 had IPSID associated with a late prelymphomatous stage. The diagnosis of IPSID is very important in patients with malabsorption syndrome, which may or may not be related to alpha heavy chain disease, because IPSID may evolve into lymphoma but its prelymphomatous stage can be treated and cured. We have therefore reported the different features seen with enteroclysis and CT, comparing the results obtained in the various forms of lymphoma of the small bowel. The importance is stressed of an accurate diagnosis of IPSID forms, however uncommon in our Country.","['De Franco, A', 'Brizi, M G', 'Barbaro, B', 'Buffa, V', 'Vecchioli, A', 'Marano, P']","['De Franco A', 'Brizi MG', 'Barbaro B', 'Buffa V', 'Vecchioli A', 'Marano P']","['Istituto di Radiologia, Universita Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, Roma.']",['ita'],"['Case Reports', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Italy,Radiol Med,La Radiologia medica,0177625,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Enema', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Ileal Neoplasms/diagnosis/*diagnostic imaging', 'Jejunal Neoplasms/diagnosis/*diagnostic imaging', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/diagnostic imaging', 'Lymphoma/diagnosis/*diagnostic imaging', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/diagnostic imaging', '*Tomography, X-Ray Computed']",1991/04/01 00:00,1991/04/01 00:01,['1991/04/01 00:00'],"['1991/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Radiol Med. 1991 Apr;81(4):459-63.,,,,Linfomi primitivi dell'intestino tenue: integrazione clinico-radiologica.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The antigen belongs to the leukocyte common antigen (LCA) family, and its molecular weight is about 180,000 daltons, which is similar to that of some previously characterized LCAs. The SHL-1 antigen is resistant to conventional tissue-fixation and embedding procedures. This antibody can therefore be used in the immunohistochemical staining of paraffin-embedded tissue sections. Wide screening with a sufficient number of both fresh and routinely processed paraffin-embedded tissues was done with indirect immunoperoxidase technique. With this procedure, SHL-1 labeled the majority of normal leukocytes and hematopoietic malignancies. Some B-cell malignancies were not stained with this antibody. The non-hematologic malignancies posing diagnostic problems of differentiation from lymphomas or leukemias were completely negative to SHL-1. The immunoreactivity to SHL-1 of samples from 24 leukemic patients and 15 human tumor cell lines was determined by the immunofluorescence method. Of 24 leukemic preparations, 23 were strongly reactive to this antibody. One case of B-cell leukemia did not react with SHL-1. No immunoreactivity was demonstrated in non-hematopoietic tumor cell lines. The overall reaction pattern of SHL-1 proved its usefulness in both diagnostic and research practice in hematological disorders. This antibody detected cell surface antigens of the T cell series more effectively than those of the B-cell series in terms of the positive number of cells and mean fluorescence intensity.","['Park, S H', 'Lee, G K', 'Bae, Y M', 'Kim, C J', 'Song, H G', 'Kim, C W', 'Chi, J G', 'Lee, S K']","['Park SH', 'Lee GK', 'Bae YM', 'Kim CJ', 'Song HG', 'Kim CW', 'Chi JG', 'Lee SK']","['Department of Pathology, College of Medicine, Seoul National University, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Pathol Res Pract,"Pathology, research and practice",7806109,IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis/*immunology', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Hematopoietic System/cytology/immunology', 'Histological Techniques', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Immunoglobulin Isotypes', 'Leukemia/immunology', 'Leukocytes/*immunology', 'Lymphoid Tissue/immunology', 'Lymphoma/immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/immunology']",1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0344-0338(11)81051-4 [pii]', '10.1016/S0344-0338(11)81051-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Pathol Res Pract. 1991 Jan;187(1):96-102. doi: 10.1016/S0344-0338(11)81051-4.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Isotypes)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In particular, mitoxantrone concentrations of 1 microM or greater were highly inhibitory to leukemic blast progenitor cell growth, and were also effective in reducing or eliminating leukemic cell self-renewal capacity in those samples assayed.

In this work, we studied the effect of hyperthermia (41-44 degrees C) on the growth of human L-CFU derived primary colonies and of secondary colonies formed by replating to evaluate the purging effect of human L-CFU by heat. The survival curves clearly demonstrated much greater hyperthermic sensitivity of L-CFU compared to normal granulocyte-macrophage progenitors (CFU-GM) at all temperatures (41-44 degrees C) studied. At 42 degrees C or higher, L-CFU decreased (by more than 2 log reduction) dramatically and therefore were unable to form colonies in vitro. At 42 degrees C and 43 degrees C, 65 and 30%, respectively, of CFU-GM obtained from remission and normal marrows were left after 1 h exposure. At 44 degrees C, however, CFU-GM derived colonies disappeared after a 2 h exposure. In the four available patients with acute myelogenous leukemia, secondary colonies formed by replating were decreased in proportion to the decreasing primary colonies during heating (42 and 43 degrees C). However, their self-renewal capacity was retained in vitro until the primary colonies disappeared. These observations suggest that heat exposure at 43 degrees C for 1 h could be the most effective conditions for in vitro purging of human L-CFU because of the wide difference between surviving fractions of CFU-GM and L-CFU.","['Moriyama, Y', 'Nikkuni, K', 'Saito, H', 'Aoki, A', 'Kishi, K', 'Takahashi, M', 'Shibata, A']","['Moriyama Y', 'Nikkuni K', 'Saito H', 'Aoki A', 'Kishi K', 'Takahashi M', 'Shibata A']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Niigata University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Bone Marrow Transplantation/methods', 'Cell Division/physiology', 'Cell Survival/physiology', 'Granulocytes/cytology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology', '*Hot Temperature', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology/therapy', 'Macrophages/cytology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1991/04/01 00:00,1991/04/01 00:01,['1991/04/01 00:00'],"['1991/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1991 Apr;5(4):332-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Both the cell line and the patient's fresh leukemia cells had the chromosomal translocation t(17;19)(q21;p13). Morphologically and cytochemically, the cells were lymphoid in appearance. Immunophenotyping of the donor's leukemia cells revealed that they express B lineage antigens (CD10+, CD19+, CD20+, CD22+); the myeloid-associated antigen (CD13) detected in the donor's leukemia cells was not expressed by the established cell line. The HAL-01 cells have a rearrangement of the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene, while the T-cell receptor beta-chain genes remain in the germline configuration. The gene encoding the binding proteins for the kappa-light chain enhancer (kappa E2), which is involved in pre-B-ALL cells with the t(1;19) (q23;p13) translocation, is not rearranged in the cell line. The HAL-01 cells were transplantable into the peritoneum of untreated nude mice where they grew as an ascites tumor. The growing tumor cells also infiltrated lymph nodes, liver, spleen, kidney, and bone marrow without exhibiting a particular change in the morphology of the neoplastic cells. Clonogenic assay in methylcellulose culture demonstrated that the proliferation of the HAL-01 cells was suppressed by interleukin-3 (IL-3) in a dose-dependent fashion, with maximum inhibition occurring at concentrations greater than 100 U/ml. Treatment with IL-3 reduced the number of viable cells as well as induced morphological changes without concomitant changes in cytochemical reactions or immunophenotypic expression. Reduction of 3H-thymidine incorporation by exposure of IL-3 was blocked by the pretreatment of neutralizing anti-IL-3 antibody, but not by neutralizing anti-TGF-beta antibody.

Significance of light scattering properties.,315-21,"Acute leukemias are classified using the morphological and cytochemical criteria set forward by the French, American and British (FAB) group. Immunophenotyping is helpful for the differential diagnosis but is secondary to the morphological criteria. Immunophenotyping performed by flow cytometry, however, can yield valuable information on cell morphology in addition to cell surface antigen expression. To provide a basis of a combined evaluation of both morphology, i.e. light scattering, and immunophenotype by flow cytometry we have compared the light scattering profiles of 70 patients newly diagnosed with acute leukemia with normal bone marrow and related the findings to the FAB classification. Three main light scattering profiles were observed in the bone marrow aspirates of the 70 patients (A1,2; B1,2,3; C1,2,3,4). A1,2, characterized by a predominant cell cluster with low forward and orthogonal light scattering, contained only and all patients diagnosed as acute lymphoblastic leukemia, acute undifferentiated leukemia, and acute non-lymphocytic leukemia M6 and M1. B1,2,3 is characterized by a predominant cell cluster with large forward and low to high orthogonal light scattering. Category B1 contained the majority of patients classified as M5; the M3 leukemias were categorized as B2. C1,2,3,4 is characterized by a predominant cell cluster with low forward and orthogonal light scattering that branches towards regions with larger light scattering. Categories C1 and C2 contained the majority of the patients classified as M2. Category C3 was specific for M4 and M4eo leukemias. The patients diagnosed as M4 were heterogeneous and equally distributed over the B and C categories. The clear relationship found between the FAB classification and classification by the light scattering profile of the acute leukemias enhances the importance of the flow cytometric classification of leukemias. In contrast with light microscopy, flow cytometry can now provide the hematologist with an objective technique to classify leukemias by the simultaneous assessment of cell surface antigen expression and cell morphology, i.e. light scattering.","['Terstappen, L W', 'Konemann, S', 'Safford, M', 'Loken, M R', 'Zurlutter, K', 'Buchner, T', 'Hiddemann, W', 'Wormann, B']","['Terstappen LW', 'Konemann S', 'Safford M', 'Loken MR', 'Zurlutter K', 'Buchner T', 'Hiddemann W', 'Wormann B']","['Becton Dickinson Immunocytometry Systems, San Jose, CA 95131.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Flow Cytometry/methods', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/classification/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*classification/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/classification/pathology', 'Light', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/classification/pathology', 'Scattering, Radiation']",1991/04/01 00:00,1991/04/01 00:01,['1991/04/01 00:00'],"['1991/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1991 Apr;5(4):315-21.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This paper reports that bryostatin inhibits the spontaneous in vitro proliferation of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia cells (CMMoL) in semi-solid medium at concentrations between 10(-8) and 10(-10) M. Growth inhibition was equivalent to or greater than that seen with phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate. Bryostatin acted primarily as a cytotoxic agent, rather than as a cytostatic agent. The spontaneous in vitro proliferation of CMMoL cells is due to autocrine or paracrine secretion of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). Bryostatin 1 actually increased GM-CSF secretion by CMMoL cells while inhibiting their proliferation. Bryostatin 1 also increased tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) secretion by CMMoL cells, and in 2/5 cases the cytotoxic effect of bryostatin 1 on fresh CMMoL cells could be substantially reversed by the addition of antibody to TNF alpha to the culture medium. Bryostatin 1 may produce a cytotoxic effect on CMMoL cells in part by increasing the secretion of, or sensitivity to, TNF alpha, and may have therapeutic potential in CMMoL.","['Lilly, M', 'Brown, C', 'Pettit, G', 'Kraft, A']","['Lilly M', 'Brown C', 'Pettit G', 'Kraft A']","['Division of Medical Oncology, Seattle VA Medical Center, University of Washington 98108.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['*Antineoplastic Agents', 'Bryostatins', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lactones/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Macrolides', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/metabolism', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",1991/04/01 00:00,1991/04/01 00:01,['1991/04/01 00:00'],"['1991/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1991 Apr;5(4):283-7.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Bryostatins)', '0 (Lactones)', '0 (Macrolides)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '37O2X55Y9E (bryostatin 1)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,,,"['CA16049/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA42533/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA45672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

The pattern of expression of these class Ib MHC genes is not well characterized, although some of their products such as the serologically detectable Qa-2 and TL Ag are expressed mainly in lymphoid and hematopoietic tissues. In this study, the expression pattern of BALB/c class I genes has been analyzed in adult bone marrow and fetal liver. cDNA libraries were synthesized from these tissues, and isolated class I cDNA clones were characterized by hybridization with oligonucleotide probes and by nucleotide sequence analysis. Of the 29 total class Ib genes, transcripts of five including Q6d, Q7d, T9c, T10c, and the 37 gene were isolated from the bone marrow cDNA library. Four of these can encode proteins; the sequence of the T10c gene demonstrates it is most likely a pseudogene. A non-overlapping set of three class Ib cDNA clones was obtained from the fetal liver, including T13c, the Thy 19.4 gene, and a previously uncharacterized class I gene provisionally designated as FL 57.2. Although the majority of H-2Dd cDNA clones that were analyzed lack introns, many of the class Ib cDNA clones contain intron sequences. This suggests that the expression of some of these genes may be regulated at the level of RNA splicing. The T13c gene encodes the thymus leukemia Ag in BALB/c mice. We have confirmed that the T13c gene is expressed in fetal liver by flow cytometric analysis of cells stained with anti-TL mAb.","['Cheroutre, H', 'Kronenberg, M', 'Brorson, K', 'Hunt, S W 3rd', 'Eghtesady, P', 'Hood, L', 'Nickerson, D A']","['Cheroutre H', 'Kronenberg M', 'Brorson K', 'Hunt SW 3rd', 'Eghtesady P', 'Hood L', 'Nickerson DA']","['Division of Biology, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena 91125.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Bone Marrow/*chemistry/immunology', 'DNA/isolation & purification', 'Female', 'Fetus/immunology', '*Gene Expression', '*Genes, MHC Class I', 'Liver/*chemistry/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C/genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Transcription, Genetic']",1991/05/15 00:00,1991/05/15 00:01,['1991/05/15 00:00'],"['1991/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/05/15 00:01 [medline]', '1991/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1991 May 15;146(10):3263-72.,['9007-49-2 (DNA)'],,,,"['AI 19624/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 09056/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 52511/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

B-CLL cells from five patients were cultured with PMA or A23187 for 72 h and used for the following experiments. Interleukin 2 (IL2) cross-linking assays showed that PMA induced the expression of IL2R subunits (p55 and p70/75) in all cases examined, but that A23187 induced neither subunit. Radiolabeled IL2 binding assays also demonstrated that PMA induced both high-affinity IL2R (HA-IL2R) and low-affinity IL2R (LA-IL2R) on B-CLL cells, but that A23187 did not. After treatment with PMA, three of five cases did not respond to IL2 even though they expressed HA-IL2R, suggesting impaired signal transduction. No cases responded to IL2 after treatment with A23187. In conclusion, PMA but not A23187 stimulates B-CLL cells to induce the expression of p55 and p70/75, indicating that the PKC pathway plays a more important role than the calcium pathway in the induction of IL2R subunits in B-CLL cells.","['Mitsui, H', 'Yagura, H', 'Tamaki, T', 'Ikeda, H', 'Matsumura, I', 'Kanakura, Y', 'Yonezawa, T', 'Tarui, S']","['Mitsui H', 'Yagura H', 'Tamaki T', 'Ikeda H', 'Matsumura I', 'Kanakura Y', 'Yonezawa T', 'Tarui S']","['Second Department of Internal Medicine, Osaka University Medical School, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Immunol Lett,Immunology letters,7910006,IM,"['Antigens, Surface/immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Binding Sites/immunology', 'Calcimycin/*pharmacology', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/*immunology', 'Protein Kinase C/metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/*metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology']",1991/02/01 00:00,1991/02/01 00:01,['1991/02/01 00:00'],"['1991/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0165-2478(91)90136-X [pii]', '10.1016/0165-2478(91)90136-x [doi]']",ppublish,Immunol Lett. 1991 Feb;27(2):105-11. doi: 10.1016/0165-2478(91)90136-x.,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '37H9VM9WZL (Calcimycin)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",,,,,,,,['Immunol Lett 1991 Aug;29(3):283.

We evaluated the heat-sensitivity of murine leukemia cells, MK-8057, and compared differences in heat-sensitivity between surviving fractions of leukemic stem cells (leukemic spleen colony-forming units, L-CFU-S) and normal hemopoietic stem cells (spleen colony-forming units, CFU-S). Using the spleen colony assay, the survival fraction of L-CFU-S was compared with that of CFU-S after various hyperthermic treatments. One of the most efficient conditions, that is, hyperthermia at 42 degrees C for 3 h, allowed only 0.17% of L-CFU-S to survive, whereas 26.5% of normal CFU-S survived. Hyperthermia at 44 degrees C for 45 min further reduced the L-CFU-S (0.13%); however, the relative ratio of L-CFU-S to CFU-S was less than that at 42 degrees C for 3 h, because there was a larger reduction at 44 degrees C in normal CFU-S (5.1%). Recipient mice injected with MK-8057 cells treated with hyperthermia survived longer in proportion to the decreasing number of surviving L-CFU-S injected. This extension of the survival of recipient mice given MK-8057 cells after hyperthermia was also proportional to the estimated survival fraction of L-CFU-S. The survival fraction of MK-8057 cells after hyperthermia that was independently calculated through the extended survival of the recipients showed a good correlation with the surviving fraction of L-CFU-S, seen as the leukemic spleen colonies, at a correlation coefficient of r = 0.985. The number of surviving mice receiving the post-hyperthermic MK-8057 cells and the number of L-CFU-S calculated to have been injected had a relationship based on a Poisson distribution. Thus, the calculated results imply that the hyperthermia proportionally targets L-CFU-S, which are the only cells responsible for killing the recipient mice.","['Iwasawa, T', 'Hirabayashi, Y', 'Kubota, N', 'Inoue, T', 'Kakehi, M', 'Matsui, K']","['Iwasawa T', 'Hirabayashi Y', 'Kubota N', 'Inoue T', 'Kakehi M', 'Matsui K']","['Department of Radiology, Yokohama City University, School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Division/physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*pathology/physiology', 'Hot Temperature/*therapeutic use', 'Injections', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/*pathology/physiopathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Spleen/cytology/physiology', 'Stem Cells/*pathology/physiology']",1991/06/01 00:00,1991/06/01 00:01,['1991/06/01 00:00'],"['1991/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1991 Jun;19(5):332-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These stromal layers were established with marrow cells from normal allogeneic donors and grown to confluence in the presence or absence of IFN alpha at low concentration (100 U/ml). The number of CML CFU-GM localized within IFN alpha-treated stromal layers was significantly greater than the corresponding number localized within control stromal layers. Conversely, the distribution of normal CFU-GM between the adherent and nonadherent compartments was unaffected by IFN alpha treatment of the stromal layer. Preincubation of CML marrow cells with IFN alpha did not alter this distribution, so the observed effect of IFN alpha must be due to a primary action on stromal layers. Thus, in addition to its well known antiproliferative effect, IFN alpha enhances the capacity of marrow stromal cells to bind and/or retain CML progenitor cells, and the resulting restoration of normal regulatory control may be the basis for the selectivity of IFN alpha in CML.","['Osterholz, J', 'Dowding, C', 'Guo, A P', 'Siczkowski, M', 'Goldman, J M']","['Osterholz J', 'Dowding C', 'Guo AP', 'Siczkowski M', 'Goldman JM']","['MRC/LRF Leukaemia Unit, Royal Postgraduate Medical School, Hammersmith Hospital, London, England.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,IM,"['Bone Marrow/*pathology/physiology', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Communication/*physiology', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Cell Division/physiology', 'Granulocytes/*pathology/physiology', 'Hematopoiesis/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Interferon Type I/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*pathology/physiopathology', 'Macrophages/*pathology/physiology', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1991/06/01 00:00,1991/06/01 00:01,['1991/06/01 00:00'],"['1991/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1991 Jun;19(5):326-31.,"['0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When the CTL are allowed to recover at 37 degrees C, a partial recovery of cytolytic activity that peaks within 6 h is observed. A dye exclusion assay demonstrated that such a heat shock does not affect the viability of the CTL and direct microscopic observations established that their ability to bind to TC is not impaired. Therefore, the step or steps inhibited by hyperthermia are subsequent to TC recognition and binding. Kupfer et al. ((1983) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 80, 7224-7228) demonstrated that upon binding to an appropriate TC, a rapid orientation of the Golgi apparatus and the microtubule organizing center (MTOC) occurred within the CTL so that the two organelles face the TC. This orientation is a prerequisite for efficient TC lysis. We have shown by immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy, using a monoclonal antibody to tubulin and a rabbit autoimmune serum that binds a centriole-associated protein, that the organization of the MTOC-microtubule array is disrupted by hyperthermia. EM suggests that this disorganization of the microtubules may result from an aggregation of the pericentriolar material. The recovery of cytolytic activity is coincident with the reorganization of the microtubules about the MTOC. These findings suggest that the initial inhibitory effect of hyperthermia on CTL function results from the disruption of microtubule organization.","['Knox, J D', 'Mitchel, R E', 'Brown, D L']","['Knox JD', 'Mitchel RE', 'Brown DL']","['Department of Biology, University of Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Female', 'Hot Temperature', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Microtubules/*ultrastructure', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/cytology/immunology/*ultrastructure']",1991/06/01 00:00,1991/06/01 00:01,['1991/06/01 00:00'],"['1991/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0014-4827(91)90365-2 [pii]', '10.1016/0014-4827(91)90365-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 1991 Jun;194(2):275-83. doi: 10.1016/0014-4827(91)90365-2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unlike other histones its synthesis is known to be constitutive during the cell cycle. The present paper provides evidence showing that, in murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells, H1(0) mRNA accumulation is coupled to DNA replication, but this mRNA is stable enough to remain present all over the cell cycle. Moreover the experiments suggest that H1(0) mRNA accumulates in mid or late S phase rather than when cells initiate DNA replication as does H3 mRNA. H1(0) gene transcription is drastically induced by chemical inducers of differentiation in this cell line. In an attempt to better understand the mechanism of this process, we have studied the inducibility of this gene with respect to the position of the cells in the cell cycle. The experiments show that the most efficient accumulation of H1(0) is observed when cells are treated by the inducer during the S phase of the cell cycle. In the same conditions, H3 mRNA accumulation remains unaffected. These results show that H1(0) mRNA, like H3 mRNA, accumulates during DNA replication, although at a different stage in this phase. The two genes differ, however, in their response to the inducer, suggesting that different regulatory elements might be involved in such a response.","['Grunwald, D', 'Khochbin, S', 'Lawrence, J J']","['Grunwald D', 'Khochbin S', 'Lawrence JJ']","[""Unite Inserm 309, Departement de Biologie Moleculaire et Structurale, Centre d'Etudes Nucleaires de Grenoble, France.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,IM,"['Acetamides/pharmacology', 'Animals', '*Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Clone Cells', 'DNA Probes', 'Hematinics/pharmacology', 'Histones/*genetics', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Leukemia, Experimental', 'Mice', 'RNA, Messenger/drug effects/genetics/*metabolism']",1991/06/01 00:00,1991/06/01 00:01,['1991/06/01 00:00'],"['1991/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0014-4827(91)90350-4 [pii]', '10.1016/0014-4827(91)90350-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 1991 Jun;194(2):174-9. doi: 10.1016/0014-4827(91)90350-4.,"['0 (Acetamides)', '0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (Hematinics)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'LA133J59VU (hexamethylene bisacetamide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An increased ADA activity, a slightly changed PNP activity, a decreased CDD activity and an increased dCK activity, including deviation in substrate specificity, were found in myeloid leukemic cells. The increase of ADA may in part be related to immaturity of the cells. This is supported by the finding of a decrease in the ADA activity during experimental induced differentiation of myeloid cells. On the other hand differentiation is not dependent on the ADA decrease, since differentiation can occur without the decrease of ADA. The correlation between myeloid blast counts in peripheral blood from AML patients and the ADA activity also supports the connection between the development stage of the cells and the ADA activity. Minor changes of the ADA activity in myeloid cells from patients with liver cirrhosis have been observed without changes in the maturity of the cells indicating that other factors than the differentiation of the cells are of importance for the activity of ADA in myeloid cells. Only minor changes have been observed in the activity of PNP related to myeloid leukemic cells. CDD activity is decreased in myeloid leukemic cells. Differentiation is probably of major importance for the activity, experimentally supported by the increase observed concurrently with induced differentiation of myeloid cells.

Eleven previously untreated patients with Stages III and IV ovarian carcinoma were treated concomitantly with 2000 cGy of WAR and intraperitoneal (IP) cisplatin followed by additional IP cisplatin after debulking surgery. Toxicity was moderate to severe. Sixty-four percent of patients had Grades 3 to 4 hematologic toxicity, and 36% required hospitalization for sepsis during WAR/IP cisplatin. Hematologic toxicity was less pronounced during IP cisplatin alone. All patients experienced moderate gastrointestinal toxicity. The average percentage of total body weight lost was 13.5%. Fifty-five percent of all patients demonstrated a complete clinical response to therapy, and patients with minimal postoperative residual disease fared better. One patient with persistent disease had acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL) 24 months after initial diagnosis. No patients with residual disease greater than 20 mm survived, while 50% of patients with less than 20 mm are clinically free of disease.

Late renal dysfunction has been described in a pediatric population status post-BMT which was attributable to the radiation in the preparatory regimen. A thorough review of adults with this type of late renal dysfunction has not previously been described. Fourteen of 103 evaluable adult patients undergoing allogeneic (96) or autologous (7) bone marrow transplantation, predominantly for leukemia and lymphomas, at the Medical College of Wisconsin (Milwaukee, WI) have had a syndrome of renal insufficiency characterized by increased serum creatinine, decreased glomerular filtration rate, anemia, and hypertension. This syndrome developed at a median of 9 months (range, 4.5 to 26 months) posttransplantation in the absence of specific identifiable causes. The cumulative probability of having this renal dysfunction is 20% at 1 year. Renal biopsies performed on seven of these cases showed the endothelium widely separated from the basement membrane, extreme thickening of the glomerular basement membrane, and microthrombi. Previous chemotherapy, antibiotics, and antifungals as well as cyclosporin may add to and possibly potentiate a primary chemoradiation marrow transplant renal injury, but this clinical syndrome is most analogous to clinical and experimental models of radiation nephritis. This late marrow transplant-associated nephritis should be recognized as a potentially limiting factor in the use of some intensive chemoradiation conditioning regimens used for BMT. Some selective attenuation of the radiation to the kidneys may decrease the incidence of this renal dysfunction.","['Lawton, C A', 'Cohen, E P', 'Barber-Derus, S W', 'Murray, K J', 'Ash, R C', 'Casper, J T', 'Moulder, J E']","['Lawton CA', 'Cohen EP', 'Barber-Derus SW', 'Murray KJ', 'Ash RC', 'Casper JT', 'Moulder JE']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, Medical College of Wisconsin Affiliated Hospitals, Milwaukee 53226.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Biopsy', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Kidney/pathology/radiation effects', 'Kidney Diseases/*etiology/pathology', 'Kidney Glomerulus', 'Leukemia/surgery', 'Middle Aged']",1991/06/01 00:00,1991/06/01 00:01,['1991/06/01 00:00'],"['1991/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19910601)67:11<2795::aid-cncr2820671114>3.0.co;2-d [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1991 Jun 1;67(11):2795-800. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19910601)67:11<2795::aid-cncr2820671114>3.0.co;2-d.,,,,,,,,,['Cancer 1991 Sep 1;68(5):1112'],,,,,,,,

DESIGN: A long term cohort study established to receive details of death certification and tumour registrations through the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys and NHS central register. PATIENTS: All patients (1246 male, 662 female) treated for short stature with pituitary growth hormone under the Medical Research Council working party and health services human growth hormone committee. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Death or development of neoplasia. RESULTS: 110 patients died (68 male, 42 female; aged 0.9-57 years) from 1972 to 1990. Fifty three death were from neoplasia responsible for growth hormone deficiency (27 craniopharyngioma, 24 other intracranial tumour, two leukaemia); two from histiocytosis X; and 13 from pituitary insufficiency. Six patients died of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, six of other neurological disorders, and eight of acute infection. Other deaths were apparently unrelated to growth hormone deficiency or its treatment. Seventeen tumours (in 16 patients) were identified during or after growth hormone treatment. Four were in patients with previous intracranial neoplasia and two were after cranial irradiation. Thirteen were intracranial, the others being Hodgkin's lymphoma, osteosarcoma, carcinoma of colon, and basal cell carcinoma. CONCLUSIONS: Recurrence or progression of intracranial tumours and potentially avoidable metabolic consequences of hypopituitarism were the main causes of death. Growth hormone treatment probably did not contribute to new tumour development. Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease after pituitary growth hormone treatment continues to occur in the United Kingdom. This cohort must remain under long term review.","['Buchanan, C R', 'Preece, M A', 'Milner, R D']","['Buchanan CR', 'Preece MA', 'Milner RD']","['Department of Growth and Development, Institute of Child Health, London.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,BMJ,BMJ (Clinical research ed.),8900488,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Brain Neoplasms/etiology/mortality', 'Cause of Death', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Craniopharyngioma/etiology/mortality', 'Creutzfeldt-Jakob Syndrome/*etiology/mortality', 'Female', 'Growth Hormone/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Hypopituitarism/drug therapy/*mortality', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/etiology/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*etiology/mortality', 'Registries', 'United Kingdom/epidemiology']",1991/04/06 00:00,1991/04/06 00:01,['1991/04/06 00:00'],"['1991/04/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/04/06 00:01 [medline]', '1991/04/06 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/bmj.302.6780.824 [doi]'],ppublish,BMJ. 1991 Apr 6;302(6780):824-8. doi: 10.1136/bmj.302.6780.824.,['9002-72-6 (Growth Hormone)'],,,,,PMC1669149,"['BMJ. 1991 May 11;302(6785):1148-9.

Preparative regimen and age were significant risk factors in the development of interstitial pneumonia in patients with CML. A flexural and acral rash ranging from pigmentation to severe erosion was noted in the Bu-Cy group, but not in the Cy-TBI group.

Human myeloma cells were highly purified (more than 95%) from bone marrow aspirates in 14 cases of advanced multiple myelomas and one case of plasma cell leukaemia. Southern blotting revealed that a rearranged configuration of c-myc gene was found in only one case of them, but this was a novel truncation of the gene in its coding exon II; a rearranged 3.4 kb band was detected by digestion with Xba I using c-myc exon II probe, but no rearranged band was found using exon III probe. In this case, the truncated c-myc allele was not transcribed; normal sized (2.4 kb) c-myc mRNA was markedly expressed, but no aberrant mRNA was detected. On the other hand, by Northern blotting, the nine cases, including the case with the rearranged c-myc gene, showed increased expression of normal sized (2.4 kb) c-myc mRNA. Elevated c-myc mRNA expressions were well related to the in vitro proliferation (3H-TdR uptake), but not to IL-6 response. Interestingly, extremely high expressions of c-myc mRNA were detected in two cases of aggressive myelomas, including the case with the rearranged c-myc gene, and in one of plasma cell leukaemia. These two cases of aggressive myelomas were the ones who showed the markedly high 3H-TdR uptakes, and had the common clinical features with the formation of an extramedullary mass and very short survival. These results suggest that the activation of c-myc gene could induce high proliferative activities and the subsequent aggressive transformation of myeloma cells.","['Nobuyoshi, M', 'Kawano, M', 'Tanaka, H', 'Ishikawa, H', 'Tanabe, O', 'Iwato, K', 'Asaoku, H', 'Sakai, A', 'Kuramoto, A']","['Nobuyoshi M', 'Kawano M', 'Tanaka H', 'Ishikawa H', 'Tanabe O', 'Iwato K', 'Asaoku H', 'Sakai A', 'Kuramoto A']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Hiroshima University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Cell Division/physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*physiology', 'Gene Rearrangement/physiology', 'Genes, myc/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Multiple Myeloma/*genetics/pathology', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'RNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/pathology']",1991/04/01 00:00,1991/04/01 00:01,['1991/04/01 00:00'],"['1991/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1991.tb08620.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1991 Apr;77(4):523-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1991.tb08620.x.,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This latter patient achieved a fourth CR with low-dose cytarabine. The remissions have been maintained with low-dose monthly courses of rIL2 given on an out-patient basis. Two AML did not respond to rIL2 alone; one, however, obtained a fourth CR with chemotherapy and rIL2. Administration of rIL2 was accompanied by organomegaly and leucocytosis, with a frequent lymphocytosis and increase in eosinophils and large granular lymphocytes, both in the blood and in the marrow. Side effects, though often severe, were controllable using a daily dose escalating protocol and never required intensive care treatment. The results of this pilot study indicate that treatment of AML patients with rIL2 is feasible and may result in the disappearance of chemotherapy-resistant blasts in patients with limited but detectable disease. Further controlled trials in AML in CR appear warranted.","['Foa, R', 'Meloni, G', 'Tosti, S', 'Novarino, A', 'Fenu, S', 'Gavosto, F', 'Mandelli, F']","['Foa R', 'Meloni G', 'Tosti S', 'Novarino A', 'Fenu S', 'Gavosto F', 'Mandelli F']","['Dipartimento di Scienze Biomediche e Oncologia Umana, University of Torino, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pilot Projects', 'Recombinant Proteins/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Remission Induction']",1991/04/01 00:00,1991/04/01 00:01,['1991/04/01 00:00'],"['1991/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1991.tb08615.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1991 Apr;77(4):491-6. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1991.tb08615.x.,"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A multivariate survival analysis in 146 patients.,478-85,"Among other patient and disease characteristics, different morphological lymphocyte subtypes were analysed in 146 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) to establish their clinical significance and prognostic value. The univariate analysis selected, among other well-known variables, the following lymphocyte subtypes as significant in prognosis: prolymphocytes, granulated lymphocytes, cleaved lymphocytes and small-size lymphocytes. The presence of prolymphocytes and cleaved lymphocytes was correlated with a poor prognosis, whereas granular lymphocytes and small-size lymphocytes were related to a good prognosis. A multivariate regression analysis showed that, besides clinical stages, haemoglobin level, WBC count, age, percentage of bone marrow erythroid cells, and sex, only prolymphocytes had independent prognostic significance. Prolymphocyte percentage correlated positively with characteristics expressing tumour mass such as WBC count, blood absolute lymphocyte count, serum lactate dehydrogenase level, number of enlarged lymph nodes, splenomegaly, and a high number of lymphocytes in bone marrow aspirate. Finally, a prolymphocyte threshold of 5 x 10(9)/l was found to be useful not only to separate two different groups of patients in the whole series but also in Rai's stages II and III + IV, and in Binet's stages A and C.","['Vallespi, T', 'Montserrat, E', 'Sanz, M A']","['Vallespi T', 'Montserrat E', 'Sanz MA']","[""Department of Haematology, Hospital General Vall d'Hebron, Barcelona, Spain.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*blood/mortality', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Lymphocytes/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Prognosis']",1991/04/01 00:00,1991/04/01 00:01,['1991/04/01 00:00'],"['1991/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1991.tb08613.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1991 Apr;77(4):478-85. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1991.tb08613.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Possible role for coproporphyrinogen oxidase.,321-6,"Murine erythroleukaemia (MEL) cells are virus-transformed erythroid precursor cells that, when induced to differentiate by dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO), will initiate haem biosynthesis by the induction and synthesis de novo of all of the enzymes of the haem-biosynthetic pathway. The activities of porphobilinogen (PBG) deaminase (EC 4.3.1.8), coproporphyrinogen oxidase (EC 1.3.3.3), protoporphyrinogen oxidase (EC 1.3.3.4), ferrochelatase (EC 4.99.1.1) and NADH:ferric iron reductase, as well as the synthesis of the enzyme ferrochelatase and the levels of excreted porphyrins, were monitored during DMSO-induced differentiation of MEL cells in culture. The data demonstrate that PBG deaminase and protoporphyrinogen oxidase activities rise rapidly and early, in comparison with ferrochelatase activity, which rises more slowly, and coproporphyrinogen oxidase activity, which decreases by 60% within 24 h of induction before returning to initial levels by 72 h. NADH:ferric iron reductase activity increases slightly, but is always present at levels higher than needed for haem synthesis. Total immunoprecipitable ferrochelatase also rises slowly and parallels the increase in its activity, suggesting that it is not synthesized early in a slowly processed precursor form. Examination of culture media demonstrated that, whereas excretion of protoporphyrin and coproporphyrin occurs within 24 h of induction, coproporphyrin is excreted in amounts 4-15 times greater than protoporphyrin.","['Conder, L H', 'Woodard, S I', 'Dailey, H A']","['Conder LH', 'Woodard SI', 'Dailey HA']","['Department of Microbiology, University of Georgia, Athens 30602.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,IM,"['Animals', '*Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Coproporphyrinogen Oxidase/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Induction', '*FMN Reductase', 'Ferrochelatase/metabolism', 'Flavoproteins', 'Heme/*biosynthesis', 'Hydroxymethylbilane Synthase/metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental', 'Mice', 'Mitochondrial Proteins', 'Oxidoreductases/metabolism', '*Oxidoreductases Acting on CH-CH Group Donors', 'Porphyrins/biosynthesis', 'Protoporphyrinogen Oxidase']",1991/04/15 00:00,1991/04/15 00:01,['1991/04/15 00:00'],"['1991/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/04/15 00:01 [medline]', '1991/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1042/bj2750321 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochem J. 1991 Apr 15;275 ( Pt 2):321-6. doi: 10.1042/bj2750321.,"['0 (Flavoproteins)', '0 (Mitochondrial Proteins)', '0 (Porphyrins)', '42VZT0U6YR (Heme)', 'EC 1.- (Oxidoreductases)', 'EC 1.3.- (Oxidoreductases Acting on CH-CH Group Donors)', 'EC 1.3.3.3 (Coproporphyrinogen Oxidase)', 'EC 1.3.3.4 (Ppox protein, mouse)', 'EC 1.3.3.4 (Protoporphyrinogen Oxidase)', 'EC 1.5.1.38 (FMN Reductase)', 'EC 1.6.99.- (ferric citrate iron reductase)', 'EC 2.5.1.61 (Hydroxymethylbilane Synthase)', 'EC 4.99.1.1 (Ferrochelatase)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",,,,"['R56 DK032303/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK32303/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK35898/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",PMC1150055,,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast, in vitro passaged FLCs injected intravenously were of low tumorigenicity, multiplied to a limited extent in the livers of suckling mice, and underwent marked differentiation from the proerythroblast to the orthochromatic erythroblast stage in the liver. The presence of characteristic C-type virions budding from the cell surface in various stages of erythroid differentiation served as a marker of the injected FLCs. When the same in vitro passaged FLCs that differentiated in the liver were injected subcutaneously in suckling mice, they formed large subcutaneous tumors consisting of sheets of undifferentiated tumor cells.

EML was seen most often in patients with T-ALL (0.05 greater than p greater than 0.02) and in patients with high white blood counts (0.1 greater than p greater than 0.05). Surprisingly, these more often achieved complete remissions (0.1 greater than p greater than 0.05), of which both the duration and disease-free survival were longer. Thus, EML at diagnosis seems to be a favourable prognostic factor. At diagnosis, 23% of the patients had extramedullary leukemic infiltration in non-lymphoid tissue (EMIL-CNS, testis, skin, pleural cavities or gingiva). While more of these patients were of T-cell origin (61%, p less than 0.01), they were less likely to achieve CR, both the duration of remissions (p less than 0.01) as well as the disease free survival were shorter. Not unexpectedly, during the course of disease, the incidence of relapse localised at EMIL (the majority presenting in ""sanctuary sites"") increased, while that in the bone marrow decreased. Interestingly, in patients in CR presenting with EMIL, the first sign of relapse was unilateral peripheral facial paralysis in 60%. Finally, it should be stressed that the course of disease in patients presenting with simultaneous EML- and EMIL involvement was like that seen for EMIL patients. We conclude that while involvement of leukemia in EMIL represents a bad prognostic sign, the affection of leukemia in EML does not seem to confer a poorer prognosis, for adult ALL patients.","['Jensen, I M', 'Jensen, P D', 'Ellegard, J', 'Bastrup-Madsen, P', 'Hokland, P']","['Jensen IM', 'Jensen PD', 'Ellegard J', 'Bastrup-Madsen P', 'Hokland P']","['Medicinsk-haematologisk afdeling 2, Arhus Amtssygehus.']",['dan'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Denmark,Ugeskr Laeger,Ugeskrift for laeger,0141730,IM,"['Adult', 'Central Nervous System/pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lymphoid Tissue/pathology', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/immunology/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Skin/pathology']",1991/04/15 00:00,1991/04/15 00:01,['1991/04/15 00:00'],"['1991/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/04/15 00:01 [medline]', '1991/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Ugeskr Laeger. 1991 Apr 15;153(16):1125-9.,,,,Ekstramedullaere manifestationer hos voksne patienter med akut lymfoblastleukaemi (ALL).,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast to previous analyses of the cohort cancer mortality data, substantial use is made of Japanese national cancer rates for the purpose of investigation of the age/time variations in excess risk. This analysis considers mortality from all cancers except leukemia as a group. Primary attention is given to description in terms of the age-specific excess relative risk, but the importance of appropriate descriptions of the absolute excess risk is also emphasized. When models for the excess risk allow variation with age and time, both constant relative and absolute excess risk models provide similar fits to the data. Previous reports have indicated that for a given age at exposure and sex, the excess age-specific relative risk is remarkably constant throughout the current follow-up period. Statistical analysis here indicates that for those less than about 35 years of age at exposure there is no departure from this pattern, beyond ordinary sampling variation. For those over about 35 years of age at exposure, there is modest evidence of an increasing trend in the excess relative risk, which could plausibly be attributed to effects related to minimal latent period. Some brief consideration is given to modeling the absolute excess risk as the product of an age-at-exposure and time-since-exposure effect. Interpretation of these results, particularly in regard to projections beyond the current follow-up, is discussed.","['Pierce, D A', 'Vaeth, M', 'Preston, D L']","['Pierce DA', 'Vaeth M', 'Preston DL']","['Department of Statistics, Oregon State University, Corvallis 97331.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Radiat Res,Radiation research,0401245,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Japan', 'Male', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/epidemiology/*etiology', '*Nuclear Warfare', 'Risk', 'Time Factors']",1991/05/01 00:00,1991/05/01 00:01,['1991/05/01 00:00'],"['1991/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Radiat Res. 1991 May;126(2):171-86.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

P388/CDDP was 4 times more resistant to CDDP than P388. The cell lines were maintained in the DBA/2 female mouse peritoneal space. In total cells, the amount of the PCNA protein decreased to 90% in P388 after 1 h CDDP treatment, but that of P388/CDDP increased to 127%. The difference was statistically significant (p = 0.012, n = 5). As for G2/M phase cells, the difference was also significant at 1 h (p = 0.016, n = 5) and at 2 h (p = 0.036, n = 5) after treatment. In P388 the amount of the PCNA protein decreased in accordance with the inhibited cell proliferation, whereas in P388/CDDP, the amount of the PCNA protein increased in spite of the inhibited cell proliferation. This increase of the PCNA protein suggests that the PCNA protein is involved in CDDP resistance of P388/CDDP through enhanced DNA repair synthesis.","['Haneda, H', 'Katabami, M', 'Miyamoto, H', 'Isobe, H', 'Shimizu, T', 'Ishiguro, A', 'Moriuti, T', 'Takasaki, Y', 'Kawakami, Y']","['Haneda H', 'Katabami M', 'Miyamoto H', 'Isobe H', 'Shimizu T', 'Ishiguro A', 'Moriuti T', 'Takasaki Y', 'Kawakami Y']","['First Department of Medicine, Hokkaido University School of Medicine, Sapporo, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Oncology,Oncology,0135054,IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Nuclear', 'Drug Resistance', 'Leukemia, Experimental/drug therapy/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Nuclear Proteins/*analysis', 'Organoplatinum Compounds/*therapeutic use', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1159/000226934 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncology. 1991;48(3):234-8. doi: 10.1159/000226934.,"['0 (Antigens, Nuclear)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Organoplatinum Compounds)', '22840-91-1 (didimethylsulfoxide dichloroplatinum(II))']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although daily administration of mouse IFN-alpha/beta markedly increased the mean survival time, most IFN-treated mice continued to harbor FLC in different organs. To investigate the mechanisms responsible for this persistent suppression of FLC growth in IFN-treated mice, we undertook a series of adoptive transfer experiments with sera and spleen cells. Sera from FLC-injected, IFN-treated mice were very effective in conferring protection on DBA/2 mice even when injected systemically (intravenously) 18-24 h before intravenous challenge with FLC. These sera also exhibited antitumor activity when injected subcutaneously or intraperitoneally together with FLC. The protective factor in serum was shown to be an immunoglobulin.

Sera from these mice recognized a specific 65-kD FLC membrane antigen(s) not detectable on membrane extracts from RBL-5 or ESb tumor cells, or on normal spleen cells. FLC-injected, IFN-treated mice also developed a specific cellular response demonstrable by transfer of protection with spleen cells injected intravenously or subcutaneously. Analysis of the responsible spleen cell populations indicated that the effector cells were neither T nor B cells.

However, there is presently no available information regarding the molecular mechanisms responsible for the regulation of cytokine gene expression by ionizing radiation. In this report, we describe the regulation of the TNF gene by ionizing radiation in human myeloid leukemia cells. The increase in TNF transcripts by x rays was both time- and dose-dependent as determined by Northern blot analysis. Similar findings were obtained in human peripheral blood monocytes. Transcriptional run-on analyses have demonstrated that ionizing radiation stimulates the rate of TNF gene transcription. Furthermore, induction of TNF mRNA was increased in the absence of protein synthesis. In contrast, ionizing radiation had little effect on the half-life of TNF transcripts. These findings indicate that the increase in TNF mRNA observed after irradiation is regulated by transcriptional mechanisms and suggest that production of this cytokine by myeloid cells may play a role in the pathophysiologic effects of ionizing radiation.","['Sherman, M L', 'Datta, R', 'Hallahan, D E', 'Weichselbaum, R R', 'Kufe, D W']","['Sherman ML', 'Datta R', 'Hallahan DE', 'Weichselbaum RR', 'Kufe DW']","['Laboratory of Clinical Pharmacology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,IM,"['Cell Line', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*radiation effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism', 'Monocytes/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogenes', 'Radiation, Ionizing', 'Transcription, Genetic/radiation effects', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*genetics']",1991/05/01 00:00,1991/05/01 00:01,['1991/05/01 00:00'],"['1991/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1172/JCI115199 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Invest. 1991 May;87(5):1794-7. doi: 10.1172/JCI115199.,"['0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)']",,,,,PMC295295,,,,,,,,,,,

Cell Physiol. 132:246, 1987). Studies were undertaken to determine whether or not the agents affected the same mitogenic pathway and locus in the cell cycle. HL-60 populations containing at least 90% G1 cells were obtained by centrifugal elutriation, exposed to 100 u/ml recombinant human GM-CSF and/or 0-1.25% DMSO, and phosphoprotein changes quantified on autoradiograms of [32P]-orthophosphate-labeled cell proteins separated by giant 2-D gel electrophoresis. Results were correlated with 1) intracellular pH, determined by measurement of BCECF fluorescence; 2) [32P]-orthophosphate uptake; 3) cell cycle progression, determined by flow quantitation of DNA content in mithramycin or propidium iodide-stained cells; and 4) growth, determined by cell volume and concentration. GM-CSF stimulated and DMSO inhibited the GM-CSF-stimulated phosphorylation of 1 protein (approximately 65 kDa, p.i. 5.6) within 2 min of exposure. These effects were sustained through G1, not associated with changes in intracellular pH, and preceded similar antagonistic effects on phosphate uptake (15-30 minutes), cell volume change (16-24 hr), and cell concentration increase (28-32 hr). GM-CSF accelerated and DMSO inhibited G1 to S transit with the most marked antagonism observed in the second cycle following synchronization (28 to 40 hrs). Cell maturation (morphology, NBT reduction) was dominated by DMSO and not antagonized by GM-CSF. We have identified p65 as the nuclear intermediate filament protein, lamin B, on the basis of its locus on gels and its binding of a monoclonal antibody to intermediate filaments and antiserum to human lamin B on immunoblots. These studies suggest that at least part of the GM-CSF-DMSO antagonism is exerted through the same mitogenic pathway, that a major locus of cytokinetic effect is on G1 to S transit, and that nuclear envelope protein phosphorylation is an important early event.","['Brennan, J K', 'Lee, K S', 'Frazel, M A', 'Keng, P C', 'Young, D A']","['Brennan JK', 'Lee KS', 'Frazel MA', 'Keng PC', 'Young DA']","['Department of Medicine, University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry, New York.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,IM,"['Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'DNA/analysis/genetics', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/*pharmacology', 'Drug Interactions', 'Flow Cytometry/methods', 'Fluoresceins', 'G1 Phase/drug effects', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Immunoblotting', 'Lamin Type B', 'Lamins', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Phosphoproteins/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'S Phase/drug effects']",1991/03/01 00:00,1991/03/01 00:01,['1991/03/01 00:00'],"['1991/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcp.1041460313 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 1991 Mar;146(3):425-34. doi: 10.1002/jcp.1041460313.,"['0 (Fluoresceins)', '0 (Lamin Type B)', '0 (Lamins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', ""85138-49-4 (2',7'-bis(carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein)"", '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",,,,"['CA 11198/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK16177/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-18208/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Segments of the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) promoter-regulatory region, which are known from previous studies to confer responsiveness to hormones, were linked to the structural genes for bovine growth hormone, amino-3'-glycosyl phosphotransferase (neo), and herpes-virus thymidine kinase and inserted into a MoMLV-based retroviral vector. In vectors in which PEPCK was the only internal promoter, it was the major site of gene transcription. This dominant effect was independent of the orientation of the PEPCK promoter relative to the 5' long terminal repeat of the provirus and was noted with as little as -174 base pairs of the 5'-flanking sequence. NIH 3T3 cells, which do not express the endogenous PEPCK gene, transcribed the transduced PEPCK-chimeric genes at the same high levels as was observed in hepatoma cells. When two promoters were present in the provirus, the expression of chimeric structural genes depended on the relative position and orientation of these genes as well as the type of cell infected by the retrovirus. Differential responses of proviral promoters in infected cells were also observed in the presence of hormones. Dibutyryl cyclic AMP increased the expression of genes linked to the PEPCK promoter in FTO-2B and NIH 3T3 cells, whereas glucocorticoids stimulated transcription from both the PEPCK promoter and the long terminal repeat in FTO-2B cells. The effect of these hormones on transcription of proviral promoters depended on their position relative to the 5' long terminal repeat. In contrast, insulin uniformly inhibited transcription from the PEPCK promoter in a position-independent manner but only in hepatoma cells and not in fibroblasts. In clonally isolated FTO-2B cells infected with a retrovirus, the site of proviral integration was also a major factor determining the expression and hormonal regulation from the internal promoters. The data suggest that the hormonal regulation of the expression of genes contained in retroviral vectors depends on the type and position of the regulatory elements present in the provirus and the lineage of the infected cell.","['Hatzoglou, M', 'Bosch, F', 'Park, E A', 'Hanson, R W']","['Hatzoglou M', 'Bosch F', 'Park EA', 'Hanson RW']","['Pew Center for Molecular Nutrition, Case Western Reserve University, School of Medicine, Cleveland, Ohio 44106.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Cattle', 'Cell Line', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA, Viral', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', '*Genetic Vectors', 'Growth Hormone/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Phosphoenolpyruvate Carboxykinase (GTP)/*genetics', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proviruses/genetics', 'Rats', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Thymidine Kinase/genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1991/05/05 00:00,1991/05/05 00:01,['1991/05/05 00:00'],"['1991/05/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/05/05 00:01 [medline]', '1991/05/05 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(18)92991-1 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1991 May 5;266(13):8416-25.,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '9002-72-6 (Growth Hormone)', 'EC 2.7.1.21 (Thymidine Kinase)', 'EC 4.1.1.32 (Phosphoenolpyruvate Carboxykinase (GTP))']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The large latent complex of TGF-beta 1 in platelets is composed of three components, i.e. the mature TGF-beta 1, which is non-covalently associated with a disulphide-bonded complex of the N-terminal remnant of the TGF-beta 1 precursor (TGF-beta 1-latency associated peptide) and the latent TGF-beta 1 binding protein (LTBP). The TGF-beta 1-latency associated peptide is sufficient for the latency of TGF-beta 1, whereas the functions of LTBP remain to be elucidated. In a human erythroleukemia cell line, HEL, the production of the latent form of TGF-beta 1 was induced more than 100-fold by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. Analysis by Northern blotting revealed that both the TGF-beta 1 precursor and LTBP were induced in a coordinated fashion. Analysis by immunoprecipitation using antibodies against LTBP and the TGF-beta 1 precursor dimer revealed that LTBP has a molecular size of 205 kd under reducing conditions in this cell type, i.e. similar to that from cells transfected with cDNA for LTBP, but larger than the platelet form (125-160 kd). Limited tryptic digestion of LTBP in HEL cells and analysis by SDS-PAGE showed protein bands of similar sizes to those of platelet LTBP, suggesting that the difference in molecular sizes of LTBP involves cell-specific processing. The biosynthesis of the latent TGF-beta 1 was studied by pulse-chase analysis. LTBP became covalently associated with the TGF-beta 1 precursor within 15 min after synthesis in this cell line. Secretion of the large latent TGF-beta 1 complex was observed as early as 30 min after the synthesis of LTBP; at the same time, a free form of LTBP not bound to the TGF-beta 1 precursor was seen. In contrast, the TGF-beta 1 precursor remained inside the cells in an unprocessed form for a longer time period and the TGF-beta 1 precursor dimer without LTBP was secreted only very slowly. Furthermore, the results of partial tryptic digestion of this molecule suggested that it contained improper disulphide bonding. These results suggest that LTBP plays a critical role in the assembly and secretion of the latent TGF-beta 1.","['Miyazono, K', 'Olofsson, A', 'Colosetti, P', 'Heldin, C H']","['Miyazono K', 'Olofsson A', 'Colosetti P', 'Heldin CH']","['Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Biomedical Center, Uppsala, Sweden.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,IM,"['Carrier Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Hydrolysis', '*Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Latent TGF-beta Binding Proteins', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Molecular Weight', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Protein Precursors/metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/*biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Trypsin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1991/05/01 00:00,1991/05/01 00:01,['1991/05/01 00:00'],"['1991/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,EMBO J. 1991 May;10(5):1091-101.,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Latent TGF-beta Binding Proteins)', '0 (Protein Precursors)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', 'EC 3.4.21.4 (Trypsin)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,,,,PMC452762,,,,,,,,,,,

Two B-lymphoblastoid cell lines (Daudi and Epstein-Barr-virus-transformed BSM) and two human leukemias, AML-M5, were used as feeder cells. The most prominent effects were seen in cultures stimulated with Daudi cells. In these cultures, cytotoxic activity was 100-1000 times increased against a broad range of target cells and the total cellular expansion was more than 40 times higher than in control cultures. This Daudi-related effect appeared to be mediated by natural killer (NK) cells, since cellular expansion occurred mostly in the CD16+ and CD56+ CD3- NK cell subset. In cultures stimulated with BSM and acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) feeder cells, the increase in proliferation was similar, but the enhancement of cytotoxicity, even though significant, was less prominent. Although all feeder cells were effective in stimulation of bone marrow reactivity, the highest cytotoxicity was always observed with feeder cells autologous to the targets, indicating some degree of specificity. This was especially evident in cultures stimulated with autologous versus allogeneic AML feeder cells. In contrast to Daudi-stimulated IL-2 cultures, in which the highest expansion of CD3- CD56+ NK cells was observed, in BSM and AML cultures, the CD3+ CD56+/-T cell subsets were more prolific. This indicates that the response and phenotypic heterogeneity of bone marrow cultures depends on the type of feeder cells used. This observation indicates that the preferential stimulation of a pertinent lymphocyte subset for therapeutic purposes may be possible.","['Fuchshuber, P R', 'Lotzova, E']","['Fuchshuber PR', 'Lotzova E']","['Department of General Surgery, University of Texas, M.

For both tumor cells, DTH against unmodified cells was markedly potentiated by prevaccination with cells treated with hydrostatic pressure combined with adenosine dialdehyde. In vitro cytotoxicity data indicated that maximal lysis of target cells is induced by vaccination with adenosine-dialdehyde-treated cells, as well as by pressure in combination with adenosine dialdehyde treatment.

These apparent Km values for cellular phosphorylation were an order of magnitude lower than the Km of deoxycytidine (dCyd) kinase for ara-C with ATP as phosphate donor. dCyd kinase was purified from human leukemia cells and assayed for [3H]ara-C kinase activity with a mixture of 7 nucleotides at their approximate cellular concentrations or with a single nucleotide deleted. At low or high ara-C concentrations, ATP, GTP, CTP, or dTTP could be eliminated without significantly altering the rate. The only potential phosphate donor that was clearly important was UTP, since its deletion reduced the rate to only 25% of that with the complete mix. As anticipated, eliminating dCTP, the end product of this salvage pathway, moderately increased the rate by 50% at 0.4 microM ara-C or by 26% at 40 microM ara-C. At 40 microM ara-C, deleting UDP from the mix increased the rate more than deleting dCTP. dCTP was less inhibitory against 1 mM UTP (50% inhibitory concentration, 26 microM) than against 4 mM ATP (50% inhibitory concentration, 2.2 microM). In kinetic assays with 4 mM ATP and variable ara-C, UDP was a potent uncompetitive inhibitor with a Ki of 4 microM; the Ki for ADP was 1000-fold higher. Direct fit of kinetic data to the Michaelis equation yielded a Km for ara-C of 49 microM with 4 mM ATP as the phosphate donor; however, there was evidence of negative cooperativity with a Hill coefficient of 0.7. High ara-C Km values were also obtained with GTP and CTP, but with no evidence of cooperativity. With 1 mM UTP, the Km was 1.5 microM with moderate substrate inhibition; thus the kinetic data with UTP were similar to those for ara-C phosphorylation by intact cells. UDP was less potent versus UTP than versus ATP. It lowered the Vmax and enhanced the ara-C substrate inhibition without altering the Km. When 1 mM UTP and 4 mM ATP were mixed, the kinetic pattern was similar to that for UTP alone. The Km for UTP with [3H]dCyd as the phosphate acceptor of 0.8 microM was 25-fold lower than the Km for ATP of 20 microM.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['White, J C', 'Capizzi, R L']","['White JC', 'Capizzi RL']","['Department of Biochemistry, Wake Forest University, Bowman Gray School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, North Carolina 27103.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Blast Crisis/*metabolism', 'Cytarabine/*metabolism', 'Deoxycytidine Kinase/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia/metabolism/*pathology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Ribonucleotides/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/metabolism', 'Uracil Nucleotides/*metabolism']",1991/05/15 00:00,1991/05/15 00:01,['1991/05/15 00:00'],"['1991/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/05/15 00:01 [medline]', '1991/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1991 May 15;51(10):2559-65.,"['0 (Ribonucleotides)', '0 (Uracil Nucleotides)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'EC 2.7.1.74 (Deoxycytidine Kinase)']",,,,['CA12197/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Exposure of K-562 cells to 4-HC resulted in a concentration- and time-dependent depletion of cellular GSH. To determine the effect of modulation of GSH levels on the toxicity of cisplatin, K-562 cells were exposed to buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) and/or GSH ethyl esters. Depletion of GSH to approximately 10% of control values by BSO potentiated the cytotoxicity of cisplatin, while rapid replenishment of GSH to within normal levels by GSH esters abolished the potentiation of BSO. Doubling cellular GSH by incubation with GSH esters protected against cisplatin cytotoxicity. Of importance, pretreatment of K-562 cells with BSO, in addition to increasing the cytotoxicity of 4-HC and cisplatin, abolished the synergism between the two drugs. The working hypothesis was also tested in two other cell lines in which the cytotoxic synergism between 4-HC and cisplatin was exhibited: the Raji cell line, a human lymphoblastic cell line, and the L1210-CPA cell line, a subclone of the murine L1210 leukemia with resistance to 4-HC. GSH levels in these two cell lines were not altered by incubation with concentrations of 4-HC at which the synergism was observed. In conclusion, the data for the K-562 cell line, indicating that (a) 4-HC depletes cellular GSH levels, (b) the lowering of cellular GSH levels enhances the toxicity of cisplatin, and (c) intact GSH stores are required for the synergism, strongly support the postulate that the cytotoxic synergism between 4-HC and cisplatin is modulated by GSH levels in this cell line. However, the lack of 4-HC-mediated depletion of GSH at concentrations of 4-HC resulting in cytotoxic synergism in the Raji and L1210-CPA cell line indicates that mechanisms other than modulation of GSH levels by 4-HC are responsible for the synergism in these cells.","['Peters, R H', 'Jollow, D J', 'Stuart, R K']","['Peters RH', 'Jollow DJ', 'Stuart RK']","['Department of Pharmacology, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston 29425.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Buthionine Sulfoximine', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/*drug effects', 'Cisplatin/*pharmacology', 'Cyclophosphamide/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Drug Synergism', 'Glutathione/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia', 'Leukemia, Experimental', 'Methionine Sulfoximine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology']",1991/05/15 00:00,1991/05/15 00:01,['1991/05/15 00:00'],"['1991/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/05/15 00:01 [medline]', '1991/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1991 May 15;51(10):2536-41.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '1982-67-8 (Methionine Sulfoximine)', '5072-26-4 (Buthionine Sulfoximine)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)', 'U880A4FUDA (perfosfamide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present investigation was prompted, in part, by observations that reduction of MTT to its colored reaction product, MTT formazan, varied between cell lines and with culture age. A correlation was established between the D-glucose concentration of the culture medium at the time of assay and the production of MTT formazan for cell lines representing seven tumor histologies. A decrease in the concentration of D-glucose from culture medium was accompanied by a decrease in MTT specific activity (MTT formazan/microgram cell protein) for a number of cell lines. Cells which extensively metabolized D-glucose exhibited the greatest reduction in MTT specific activity. Further evidence that the D-glucose concentration of the culture medium played an important role in MTT reduction was provided by experiments which demonstrated that transfer of cells to a glucose-free medium (L-15) was accompanied by an immediate decrease in MTT reduction which was pH independent. These studies suggested that cellular transport and constant metabolism of glucose were required for maximum MTT reduction. Decreases in the cellular concentration of the reduced pyridine nucleotides NADH and NADPH were accompanied by concomitant decreases in MTT formazan production. MTT formazan varied significantly among cell lines in both the kinetics of its formation and the degree of saturability exhibited. Apparent IC50 values for Adriamycin varied, in a cell line-specific manner, with MTT exposure time. These results indicate that MTT specific activity is significantly influenced by a number of parameters and suggest that assay conditions should be established which minimize their effects.","['Vistica, D T', 'Skehan, P', 'Scudiero, D', 'Monks, A', 'Pittman, A', 'Boyd, M R']","['Vistica DT', 'Skehan P', 'Scudiero D', 'Monks A', 'Pittman A', 'Boyd MR']","['Laboratory of Drug Discovery Research and Development, National Cancer Institute, Frederick, Maryland 21702-1201.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Carcinoma, Renal Cell', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', '*Cell Survival', 'Coloring Agents', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor/*methods', 'Formazans/*analysis', 'Glucose/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kidney Neoplasms', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive', 'NAD/metabolism', 'NADP/metabolism', '*Tetrazolium Salts', '*Thiazoles']",1991/05/15 00:00,1991/05/15 00:01,['1991/05/15 00:00'],"['1991/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/05/15 00:01 [medline]', '1991/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1991 May 15;51(10):2515-20.,"['0 (Coloring Agents)', '0 (Formazans)', '0 (Tetrazolium Salts)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '0U46U6E8UK (NAD)', '53-59-8 (NADP)', 'EUY85H477I (thiazolyl blue)', 'IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)']",,,,,,,,['Cancer Res 1991 Aug 15;51(16):4501'],,,,,,,,

For this review, the following selection criteria were used: the original articles on Ph-negative cases should provide clinical, hematologic, cytogenetic as well as molecular data. In addition, eight unpublished cases of Ph-negative CML are included that were studied in our institute during the last two years. Our purpose was to correlate presence or absence of the Ph rearrangement with the clinical features in an attempt to test whether the entity ""Ph-negative CML"" really exists and to identify the pathologic characteristics, frequency of occurrence, prognosis for survival, and underlying molecular mechanisms. Data on Ph-negative CML patients were compared with data on Ph-positive CML, atypical CML (aCML), and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMMoL), reported in the same papers as the Ph negative patients. Essential for comparison of data from the different investigators appeared to be a clear description of criteria they used to establish the diagnosis CML, or alternatively a complete presentation of data for all patients reported in the articles. In most cases, Ph-negative CML was distinguishable from CMMoL and aCML, using simple criteria, e.g., differential count of peripheral blood and absence of dysplasia in the bone marrow. Cytogenetic analysis showed normal karyotype in most cases of Ph-negative CML. Interestingly, in cases with abnormal karyotype, chromosome 9 band q34 was relatively frequently involved in translocations with other chromosomes than chromosome 22, suggesting a variant Ph translocation not visible by cytogenetic techniques. This assumption was confirmed by molecular analysis, demonstrating bcr-abl rearrangement in 9 out of 10 of the latter cases. Results of cytogenetic and molecular investigations in 136 cases of Ph-negative CML reviewed in this article clearly indicated that molecular techniques are valuable tools for identification of bcr-abl rearrangements, indicative for the Ph translocation. The different mechanisms responsible for bcr-abl rearrangement in Ph-negative CML patients are discussed. The question remains whether all Ph-negative CML patients will have bcr-abl rearrangements, or whether alternative mechanisms will be identified that are responsible for this disease.","['van der Plas, D C', 'Grosveld, G', 'Hagemeijer, A']","['van der Plas DC', 'Grosveld G', 'Hagemeijer A']","['MGC--Department of Cell Biology and Genetics, Erasmus University, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,IM,"['Chromosomes, Human, Pair 22', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Genes, abl', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic, Atypical, BCR-ABL Negative/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Translocation, Genetic']",1991/04/01 00:00,1991/04/01 00:01,['1991/04/01 00:00'],"['1991/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0165-4608(91)90457-6 [pii]', '10.1016/0165-4608(91)90457-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 1991 Apr;52(2):143-56. doi: 10.1016/0165-4608(91)90457-6.,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",67,"['abl', 'bcr']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Case-control study. SETTING: Caithness local government district. SUBJECTS: 14 cases of leukaemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma occurring in children aged under 15 years diagnosed in the area between 1970 and 1986 and 55 controls matched for sex, date of birth, and area of residence within Caithness at time of birth. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Antenatal abdominal x ray examination; drugs taken and viral infections during pregnancy; father's occupation; father's employment at Dounreay and radiation dose; distance of usual residence from the path of microwave beams, preconceptional exposure to non-ionising radiation in the father; and other lifestyle factors. RESULTS: No raised relative risks were found for prenatal exposure to x rays, social class of parents, employment at Dounreay before conception or diagnosis, father's dose of ionising radiation before conception, or child's residence within 50 m of the path of microwave transmission beams. Results also proved negative for all lifestyle factors except an apparent association with use of beaches within 25 km of Dounreay. However, this result was based on small numbers, arose in the context of multiple hypothesis testing, and is certainly vulnerable to possible systematic bias. CONCLUSION: The raised incidence of childhood leukaemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma around Dounreay cannot be explained by paternal occupation at Dounreay or by paternal exposure to external ionising radiation before conception. The observation of an apparent association between the use of beaches around Dounreay and the development of childhood leukaemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma might be an artefact of multiple testing and influenced by recall bias.","['Urquhart, J D', 'Black, R J', 'Muirhead, M J', 'Sharp, L', 'Maxwell, M', 'Eden, O B', 'Jones, D A']","['Urquhart JD', 'Black RJ', 'Muirhead MJ', 'Sharp L', 'Maxwell M', 'Eden OB', 'Jones DA']","['Information and Statistics Division, Scottish Health Service, Edinburgh.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,BMJ,BMJ (Clinical research ed.),8900488,IM,"['Case-Control Studies', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/epidemiology/*etiology', '*Nuclear Reactors', 'Occupational Exposure', 'Occupations', 'Parents', 'Pregnancy', 'Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects', 'Risk Factors', 'Scotland/epidemiology', 'Socioeconomic Factors']",1991/03/23 00:00,1991/03/23 00:01,['1991/03/23 00:00'],"['1991/03/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/03/23 00:01 [medline]', '1991/03/23 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/bmj.302.6778.687 [doi]'],ppublish,BMJ. 1991 Mar 23;302(6778):687-92. doi: 10.1136/bmj.302.6778.687.,,,,,,PMC1669098,"['BMJ. 1991 Apr 13;302(6781):907.

DESIGN: Case-control study. Information on parents was obtained by home interview. SETTING: Three areas in north England: Copeland and South Lakeland (west Cumbria); Kingston upon Hull, Beverley, East Yorkshire, and Holderness (north Humberside), and Gateshead. SUBJECTS: 109 children aged 0-14 born and diagnosed as having leukaemia or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in study areas during 1974-88. Two controls matched for sex and date and district of birth were obtained for each child. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Occupations of parents and specific exposure of parents before the children's conception, during gestation, and after birth. Other adults living with the children were included in the postnatal analysis. RESULTS: Few risk factors were identified for mothers, although preconceptional association with the food industry was significantly increased in case mothers (odds ratio 2.56; 95% confidence interval 1.32 to 5.00). Significant associations were found between childhood leukaemia and reported preconceptional exposure of fathers to wood dust (2.73, 1.44 to 5.16), radiation (3.23, 1.36 to 7.72), and benzene (5.81, 1.67 to 26.44); ionising radiation alone gave an odds ratio of 2.35 (0.92 to 6.22). Raised odds ratios were found for paternal exposure during gestation, but no independent postnatal effect was evident. CONCLUSION: These results should be interpreted cautiously because of the small numbers, overlap with another study, and multiple exposure of some parents. It is important to distinguish periods of parental exposures; identified risk factors were almost exclusively restricted to the time before the child's birth.","['McKinney, P A', 'Alexander, F E', 'Cartwright, R A', 'Parker, L']","['McKinney PA', 'Alexander FE', 'Cartwright RA', 'Parker L']","['Leukaemia Research Fund, University of Leeds.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,BMJ,BMJ (Clinical research ed.),8900488,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Benzene/adverse effects', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'England', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/chemically induced/*etiology', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/etiology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*etiology', 'Male', 'Occupational Exposure', '*Occupations', 'Odds Ratio', '*Parents', 'Pregnancy', 'Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects', 'Risk Factors', 'Time Factors', 'Wood']",1991/03/23 00:00,1991/03/23 00:01,['1991/03/23 00:00'],"['1991/03/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/03/23 00:01 [medline]', '1991/03/23 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/bmj.302.6778.681 [doi]'],ppublish,BMJ. 1991 Mar 23;302(6778):681-7. doi: 10.1136/bmj.302.6778.681.,['J64922108F (Benzene)'],,,,,PMC1669138,['BMJ. 1991 Mar 23;302(6778):672-3.

Two hundred and ninety patients were evaluable. There was no statistically significant difference between the complete remission (CR) rates (63% for MOPP, 57% for LOPP), percentage of patients remaining disease free at 5 years (38% for MOPP, 35% for LOPP) and overall survival at 5 years (65% for MOPP, 64% for LOPP). On multivariate analysis younger age, grade I histopathology, absence of systemic symptoms, and normal albumin level were favourable prognostic factors for survival. Acute toxicity in the form of nausea/vomiting, myelosuppression, and phlebitis were less with LOPP than MOPP. Deaths in both groups were usually due to disseminated Hodgkin's disease; there were no infective deaths in the absence of Hodgkin's disease. Second malignancies occurred in six patients treated with MOPP--three acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), one non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), two carcinomas (Ca); with LOPP, four second malignancies occurred (one AML, one NHL, two Ca).

Sodium vanadate (55 microM) did not affect production of PGE2 and PGF2 alpha in rat basophil leukemia cells (the RBL-1 cell line) stimulated by the Ca2(+)-ionophore A-23187, but did inhibit synthesis of peptide-containing leukotrienes and 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid. When used with cultured cells at micromolar concentrations, vanadate is known to inhibit protein tyrosine-phosphate phosphatases.

Results are given for all cancers except leukemia as a group, for leukemia, and for combined inferences assuming common curvature. Since there is substantial information aside from these data suggesting a dose-response curve with upward curvature, the emphasis here is not on estimating the best-fitting dose-response curve, but rather on assessing the maximum curvature under linear-quadratic models which is consistent with the data. The apparent shape of the dose-response curve is substantially affected by imprecision in the dose estimates, and methods are applied to correct for this. The extent of curvature can be expressed as the factor by which linear risk estimates from these data should be divided to arrive at appropriate estimates of risk at low doses. Influential committees have in the past recommended ranges of 1.5-4 and of 2-10 for such a factor. Results here suggest that values greater than about 2.0-2.5 are at least moderately inconsistent with these data, within the context of linear-quadratic models.

Although this correlation may hold in some pathological situations, it is lost in others. In leukemia a dissociation has been observed between serum ferritin levels and bone marrow iron stores. Leukemic cells were demonstrated to contain high levels of ferritin and to secrete it in the serum, causing this dissociation. In this study we investigated the possibility of having an analogous situation in patients on chronic hemodialysis. The latter patients have normal or high ferritin levels irrespective of bone marrow iron stores. Our results show that blood neutrophils and lymphocytes do not contribute to the high serum ferritin levels in these patients. Ferritin level in blood monocytes, however, was found to correlate with the serum ferritin levels and bone marrow iron stores in dialysis patients. Hence we concluded that sources other than blood leukocytes must be contributing to the high serum ferritin level in these patients. On the other hand, to unravel the role played in these changes by the monocytic cell population requires dynamic studies.","['Nuwayri-Salti, N', 'Jabre, F', 'Saab, G', 'Daouk, M', 'Salem, Z']","['Nuwayri-Salti N', 'Jabre F', 'Saab G', 'Daouk M', 'Salem Z']","['Department of Human Morphology, Faculty of Medicine, American University of Beirut, Lebanon.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Nephron,Nephron,0331777,IM,"['Adult', 'Bone Marrow/chemistry', 'Cell Separation', 'Female', 'Ferritins/analysis/*blood', 'Humans', 'Iron/analysis', 'Kidney Failure, Chronic/metabolism/therapy', 'Leukocytes/*chemistry', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Renal Dialysis']",1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1159/000186241 [doi]'],ppublish,Nephron. 1991;57(2):144-8. doi: 10.1159/000186241.,"['9007-73-2 (Ferritins)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Studies in Sweden have shown an excess of leukemia and stomach cancer in humans exposed to ethylene oxide, but other studies have generally failed to confirm these findings. METHODS: We conducted a study of mortality in 18,254 U.S. workers exposed to ethylene oxide at 14 plants producing sterilized medical supplies and spices. The subjects averaged 4.9 years of exposure to the gas and 16 years of follow-up. The exposure levels in recent years averaged 4.3 ppm (eight-hour time-weighted adjusted exposure) for sterilizer operators and 2.0 ppm for other workers. The levels in earlier years are likely to have been several times higher. Mortality in this cohort was compared with that in the general U.S. population. RESULTS: Overall there was no significant increase in mortality from any cause in the study cohort. The standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were 0.97 for leukemia (95 percent confidence interval, 0.52 to 1.67; 13 deaths observed), 1.06 for all hematopoietic cancers (95 percent confidence interval, 0.75 to 1.47; 36 deaths), and 0.94 for stomach cancer (95 percent confidence interval, 0.45 to 1.70; 11 deaths). Analyses according to job category and according to the duration of exposure showed no excess in cancers, as compared with the rate in the general population, but there was a significant trend toward increased mortality with increasing lengths of time since the first exposure for all hematopoietic cancers. The rate of death from hematopoietic cancer (especially non-Hodgkin's lymphoma) was significantly increased among men (SMR, 1.55; 27 deaths). Mortality from leukemia in recent years (1985 through 1987) was significantly increased among men (SMR, 3.45; 5 deaths). CONCLUSIONS: For the entire cohort, there was no increase in mortality from hematopoietic cancer. There was a slight but significant increase among men, however. Among men and women combined, there was a trend toward an increased risk of death from hematopoietic cancer with increasing lengths of time since the first exposure to ethylene oxide.","['Steenland, K', 'Stayner, L', 'Greife, A', 'Halperin, W', 'Hayes, R', 'Hornung, R', 'Nowlin, S']","['Steenland K', 'Stayner L', 'Greife A', 'Halperin W', 'Hayes R', 'Hornung R', 'Nowlin S']","['National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, Cincinnati, OH 45226.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,N Engl J Med,The New England journal of medicine,0255562,IM,"['Cohort Studies', 'Ethylene Oxide/*toxicity', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/mortality', 'Lymphoma/mortality', 'Male', '*Mortality', 'Neoplasms/mortality', 'Occupational Diseases/mortality', 'Occupational Exposure', 'Stomach Neoplasms/mortality', 'Time Factors', 'United States/epidemiology']",1991/05/16 00:00,1991/05/16 00:01,['1991/05/16 00:00'],"['1991/05/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/05/16 00:01 [medline]', '1991/05/16 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1056/NEJM199105163242004 [doi]'],ppublish,N Engl J Med. 1991 May 16;324(20):1402-7. doi: 10.1056/NEJM199105163242004.,['JJH7GNN18P (Ethylene Oxide)'],,,,,,['N Engl J Med. 1991 Oct 24;325(17):1254.

Whereas N-dimethylated natural anthracyclines, pyrromycin, marcellomycin, and aclacinomycin A stimulated erythroid differentiation (induction of hemoglobin synthesis), this was not seen with adriamycin, daunomycin and their N-dimethylated derivatives. The incorporation of 3H-mannose in glycoprotein was inhibited by the N-alkylated natural anthracyclines at a concentration at which they induced erythroid differentiation. N,N-Dimethyladriamycin and N,N-dimethyldaunomycin only inhibited 3H-mannose incorporation into glycoprotein at cytotoxic concentrations. However, adriamycin and daunomycin did not inhibit glycoprotein synthesis, even at high cytotoxic concentrations. Aclacinomycin A decreased the incorporation of 3H-mannose into proteins earlier than the incorporation into dolichol-linked oligosaccharide intermediates. Tunicamycin, a specific inhibitor of glycoprotein synthesis, failed to stimulate differentiation in Friend erythroleukemia cells. These results indicate a structure-specific induction of the differentiation and inhibition of glycoprotein synthesis in Friend cells by N-alkylated anthracyclines.

It allows the exponential amplification of the rearranged region, thus facilitating its detection. The specificity of the bcr/abl cDNA sequence amplified by PCR is most commonly verified by hybridization to a 32P-labeled probe. In this paper, an assay for the colorimetric detection of the amplified bcr/abl fragment is described, which offers several advantages over the use of radioactive probes. We adapted the PCR for synthesis and simultaneous labeling of DNA fragments with a non-radioactive steroid compound called digoxigenin. This labeling procedure was used to generate a digoxigenin-labeled internal probe for the chimeric bcr/abl mRNA. The assay described is based on the hybridization of the amplified bcr/abl sequence to the non-radioactively labeled probe and on the subsequent detection by an enzyme-linked immunoassay and enzyme-catalyzed color reaction. Using this protocol, we investigated 20 patients with CML along with six healthy individuals and two cell lines derived from patients with CML for the presence of the bcr/abl rearrangement. It is shown that the assay is both highly sensitive and specific and that it is readily applicable to the routine diagnosis of CML.

We prospectively measured CIC by the C1q binding assay in 100 untreated patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) de novo. The median CIC level was 135, the range 0-1000, and the mean +/- standard error (SE) 175 +/- 18 micrograms/ml.

Abnormal CIC levels did not correlate with FAB morphology, the presence of a clonal chromosomal abnormality (76% of all patients), or with specific cytogenetic subgroups, although nine of 11 patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia and t(15;17) had abnormal CIC. There were no significant differences in complete remission (CR) rates after the first chemotherapy course (45 vs 40% for normal vs abnormal CIC) or after all courses of treatment (55 vs 65%).

Peptides belonging to this family have many biological activities including the non-oxidative destruction of ingested microorganisms, the inhibition of adrenocorticotropin-stimulated synthesis of glucocorticoids, monocyte chemotaxis, the non-cytolytic inhibition of [3H]thymidine incorporation in HL-60 promyelocyte-like cells and the stimulation of nifedipine-sensitive calcium channels. Using a combination of reversed-phase and size-exclusion high performance liquid chromatography and an HP-1 radio-immunoassay, three immunoreactive peptides were detected and isolated from the promyelocyte-like cell line, HL-60, and from leukocytes of patients with chronic myelogenous and chronic lymphocytic leukemias. One of these peptides was HP-1 itself. A second was identified by gas-phase Edman microsequencing as an amino-terminally extended fragment of the HP-1 precursor which we call HP1-56. The third is likely to arise from enzymatic cleavage of the precursor at a dibasic site. Of the leukemic cells the greatest amount of HP1-56 relative to HP-1 was found in cells from a patient in myeloblastic crisis but overall the richest source of HP1-56 relative to HP-1 was found to be in fetal lung tissue. HP1-56 is difficult to detect in normal peripheral neutrophils and its presence in cells that are actively biosynthesizing primary granule components such as HL-60 may make it useful for studying the biosynthesis of granule polypeptides, their ontogeny, and possibly as a marker protein for leukemic diseases.","['Bateman, A', 'Singh, A', 'Shustik, C', 'Mars, W M', 'Solomon, S']","['Bateman A', 'Singh A', 'Shustik C', 'Mars WM', 'Solomon S']","['Department of Medicine, Obstetrics, and Gynecology, Royal Victoria Hospital/McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Blood Proteins/genetics/*isolation & purification', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Cross Reactions', 'DNA/genetics', 'Defensins', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neutrophils/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', '*alpha-Defensins']",1991/04/25 00:00,1991/04/25 00:01,['1991/04/25 00:00'],"['1991/04/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/04/25 00:01 [medline]', '1991/04/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(20)89478-2 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1991 Apr 25;266(12):7524-30.,"['0 (Blood Proteins)', '0 (Defensins)', '0 (alpha-Defensins)', '0 (human neutrophil peptide 1)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",,,,['3 RO1 HDO4365/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The question arose whether the effect of v-abl could be attributed to a deregulation of interleukin-6 (IL-6) production or responsiveness, in view of the fact that IL-6 exerts potent growth-stimulatory activity on PC cells. We studied the effect of IL-6 on the in vitro growth of primary PCs induced by pristane alone (TEPCs) or by pristane + A-MuLV (ABPCs). Five of 13 TEPCs and 3 of 7 ABPCs responded to IL-6. Macrophage supernatants prepared from both TEPCs and ABPCs had similar stimulatory effects on PC cells. From 30 primary PCs (including both TEPCs and ABPCs), we established 9 in vitro lines, 2 of which expressed v-abl. All were able to grow on macrophage feeder layers. Three types of behavior could be distinguished on the basis of growth in feeder-free cultures in the presence and absence of IL-6. Group I contained 4 IL-6-dependent lines. Group II contained 2 IL-6-independent lines (one v-abl expressor) that grew faster in the presence of IL-6. Group III consisted of 3 feeder-dependent lines (one v-abl expressor) that were not significantly stimulated by IL-6. These findings indicate that v-abl expression does not influence IL-6 dependence or responsiveness by itself. The supernatant of one line in group II was able to stimulate PC cells. All 6 lines of Groups I and II carried a typical (12;15) translocation, while all 3 lines in group III had a variant (6;15) or (15;16) translocation.","['Sugiyama, H', 'Wiener, F', 'Babonits, M', 'Silva, S', 'Hirano, T', 'Kishimoto, T', 'Klein, G']","['Sugiyama H', 'Wiener F', 'Babonits M', 'Silva S', 'Hirano T', 'Kishimoto T', 'Klein G']","['Department of Tumor Biology, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,IM,"['Abelson murine leukemia virus', 'Animals', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Genes, abl/*physiology', 'Growth Substances/metabolism', 'Interleukin-6/pharmacology/*physiology', 'Macrophages/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Plasmacytoma/*etiology/genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Terpenes', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1991/05/10 00:00,1991/05/10 00:01,['1991/05/10 00:00'],"['1991/05/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/05/10 00:01 [medline]', '1991/05/10 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.2910480214 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1991 May 10;48(2):234-8. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910480214.,"['0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Terpenes)', '26HZV48DT1 (pristane)']",,['v-abl'],,['5 RO1 CA 14054-15/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, case clustering has sometimes been associated with influxes of population into relatively isolated communities. To investigate this further, disease incidence rates for HD at ages 0 to 24 from a specialist tumour registry have been regressed against relevant electoral ward characteristics derived from routine census and Ordnance Survey data for England and Wales. Proximity to built-up areas and higher socio-economic status (SES) emerge as significant risk factors. The relative risks are 1.21 (95% Cl: 1.01-1.46) for high SES wards and 1.29 (1.05-1.58) for ""inner zone"" wards. No association of disease risk with distance travelled to work was apparent. Regions farther from built-up areas have a lower overall incidence and a shift, particularly for males, of the age distribution towards older ages. The distribution resembles the intermediate pattern for HD reported from European rural areas of low SES but never previously for high SES. Isolated areas also show an increased intensity of spatial clustering (29% of cases being classified as clustered).

However, no effect was observed when mAb treatment was performed with either the CEM or Jurkat T cell lines. Our investigation of how RL4-24-6 interferes with the HIV replicative cycle revealed that: (a) incubation of PBMC with RL4-24-6 prior to HIV exposure did not change the susceptibility of these cells to HIV infection, (b) syncytia formation between CD4+ MT4 cells and HIV chronically infected PBMC was not affected by RL4-24-6 and (c) treatment of freshly infected PBMC with RL4-24-6, however, inhibited viral production.

However, it is still unclear at which stage of erythroid differentiation this interaction occurs, mainly because of the lack of purified populations of normal erythroid progenitors [erythroid colony-forming units (CFU-E) and erythroid burst-forming units (BFU-E)] and early precursor cells (proerythroblasts) and because of our limited knowledge of their ultrastructural characteristics. In the present work we analyzed the ultrastructure of CFU-E enriched from normal human bone marrow by avidin-biotin immune rosetting and leukemic blasts of erythroid origin from two patients. Normal and leukemic CFU-Es were defined as glycophorin A (GPA)-negative blasts, devoid of rhopheocytosis, containing some ferritin molecules, either free in the cytoplasm or associated with theta-granules (theta-Gr) in the Golgi zone. Peroxidase activity was detected in the endoplasmic reticulum of these blasts. A preproerythroblast stage was identified, which corresponded to an intermediate phenotype with few GPA sites and rhopheocytosis. In contrast to hemoglobin synthesis, which was absolutely dependent on the presence of erythropoietin (Epo) during culture for 24 hours, ferritin molecules accumulated in the absence of Epo. Interestingly, leukemic CFU-E-like blasts were always in contact with bone marrow macrophages and adhesion between these cell types resisted mechanical dissociation. This result suggests that erythroid progenitors may be part of the erythroblastic island. The mechanisms involved in erythroblast-macrophage binding are still unknown, but the expression by macrophages and erythroid progenitors of receptors for fibronectin and thrombospondin (TSP), as well as their respective ligands in the case of macrophages, suggests that these molecules could be involved in the formation of the erythroblastic island.","['Breton-Gorius, J', 'Vuillet-Gaugler, M H', 'Coulombel, L', 'Guichard, J', 'Teillet, F', 'Vainchenker, W']","['Breton-Gorius J', 'Vuillet-Gaugler MH', 'Coulombel L', 'Guichard J', 'Teillet F', 'Vainchenker W']","['INSERM U.91 Hopital Henri Mondor, Creteil, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood Cells,Blood cells,7513567,IM,"['*Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Communication/*physiology', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/*physiology/ultrastructure', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Histocytochemistry', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*pathology', 'Macrophages/*physiology']",1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Blood Cells. 1991;17(1):127-42; discussion 142-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Four were apparently balanced [t(1;3)(p34;p21), t(7;9)(p15;p23-p24), t(12;13)(p13;q14), t(17;19)(q22;p13)], while three were unbalanced with the formation of a dicentric chromosome [dic(7;9)(p13;p11), dic(7;12)(p11;p12), and dic(12;17)(p11;p11-p12)]. One translocation was observed in five cases, two in four cases, and the remaining four in two cases each. The modal chromosome numbers in these 21 cases were 45 (n = 11), 46 (n = 8), and 47 (n = 2). Eight of the 11 cases with a dicentric chromosome had a modal number of 45. Only a single translocation was found in 14 cases (67%), representing the sole structural abnormality in six cases. In three of the seven translocation subgroups, the blast cells were consistently of B lineage (pre-B, early pre-B, or both); in all others, they represented both the B and T lineages. The small size of these subgroups prevented definitive clinical correlations, although it may be important that two of the four cases with a t(17;19) and an early pre-B-cell immunophenotype had disseminated intravascular coagulation, an event usually observed in acute promyelocytic leukemia or T-cell ALL. These findings add substantially to the existing list of nonrandom chromosomal translocations in childhood ALL and may help to explain the genetic alterations leading to the loss of normal growth control mechanisms in this disease.","['Raimondi, S C', 'Privitera, E', 'Williams, D L', 'Look, A T', 'Behm, F', 'Rivera, G K', 'Crist, W M', 'Pui, C H']","['Raimondi SC', 'Privitera E', 'Williams DL', 'Look AT', 'Behm F', 'Rivera GK', 'Crist WM', 'Pui CH']","[""Department of Pathology/Laboratory Medicine, St Jude Children's Research Hospital 38105.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 1', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 12', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 13', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 19', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 3', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/genetics', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', '*Translocation, Genetic']",1991/05/01 00:00,1991/05/01 00:01,['1991/05/01 00:00'],"['1991/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)82422-7 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1991 May 1;77(9):2016-22.,,,,,"['CA-20180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

The proliferation of leukemic cells from the bone marrow of 11 of 13 patients (seven at diagnosis, four in relapse) and from the 697 (BCP-ALL) cell line was significantly inhibited by rTNF-alpha at the lowest dose tested (0.1 ng/mL), as measured by 3H-TdR uptake. The degree of inhibition was variable, ranging from 17% to 78%. Furthermore, a dose-dependent inhibitory effect was observed, with approximately 70% mean inhibition of DNA synthesis detected when cells from 12 of 13 patients were incubated with 100 ng/mL of rTNF-alpha for 3 days. In contrast, rTNF-alpha did not inhibit another BCP-ALL cell line (EU-1/ALL) established recently in our laboratory. Studies indicated that the TNF-alpha gene was expressed by the primary leukemic blasts of one TNF-resistant case in his third relapse and by EU-1 cells. Also, TNF-alpha protein was detected by Western blot analysis and enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay in the supernatant of EU-1 cells; this is the first report of TNF production by a BCP-ALL cell lines. The production of TNF-alpha mRNA and protein was not detected in the 697 cell line and in the primary leukemic blasts from six patients (four at diagnosis, two in relapse) whose leukemic cells were inhibited by TNF. The partially purified TNF-alpha obtained from the EU-1 cell line also suppressed the proliferation of TNF-sensitive primary leukemic cells, and this inhibitory activity was abolished by an anti-TNF-alpha specific antibody. Our results demonstrate that TNF-alpha is an inhibitor of in vitro proliferation of BCP-ALL cells from most patients. The TNF-resistant leukemic cells from a few patients and the EU-1 cell line express TNF mRNA, suggesting that the induction of TNF gene expression is associated with the development of TNF resistance.","['Zhou, M X', 'Findley, H W', 'Ma, L H', 'Zaki, S R', 'Hill, T', 'Hamid, M', 'Hooper, W C', 'Ragab, A H']","['Zhou MX', 'Findley HW', 'Ma LH', 'Zaki SR', 'Hill T', 'Hamid M', 'Hooper WC', 'Ragab AH']","['Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Emory University, Atlanta, GA 30322.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Blotting, Western', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*pathology', 'Cell Division', 'Child', 'DNA/biosynthesis', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/genetics/*pharmacology']",1991/05/01 00:00,1991/05/01 00:01,['1991/05/01 00:00'],"['1991/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)82420-3 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1991 May 1;77(9):2002-7.,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",,,,['CA20549/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Sixty-one percent of patients, with a 95% confidence interval (CI) ranging from 49% to 72%, achieved complete remission (CR), including 45% (CI: 30% to 62%) of refractory patients and 81% (CI: 64% to 93%) of late first relapse patients.

Some possible reasons for the inhibition of DNA synthesis including effects of MD on intracellular deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate pools were examined and ruled out. Although results from previous studies using rat hepatocytes suggested that mitochondria may be a target of MD, no significant effect of this compound on total intracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) pools in human cancer cell lines was observed.

Therefore the circumvention of drug-resistance by verapamil must be related to some other mechanism. In the present study, verapamil and two other circumventors of drug-resistance, tamoxifen and dipyridamole were found to induce an increase in the synthesis of phosphatidylcholine in multidrug-resistant but not in drug-sensitive cells. The relative resistance of multidrug resistance cells to permeabilization by digitonin indicates that the organization of the plasma membrane lipids in these cells must be different from the one occurring in drug-sensitive cells. Extended exposure of multidrug-resistant cells to verapamil negates the resistance to digitonin. This effect of verapamil reflects its ability to modify the lipid organization of the plasma membrane of multidrug-resistant cells. It is suggested that if the lipid composition of the cell membrane is altered by these drugs as was found for whole cells, the change could explain the increase in drug permeability.","['Ramu, A', 'Ramu, N', 'Rosario, L M']","['Ramu A', 'Ramu N', 'Rosario LM']","['Department of Oncology, Hadassah University Hospital, Jerusalem, Israel.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Cell Membrane Permeability/drug effects', 'Choline/metabolism', 'Digitonin/pharmacology', 'Dipyridamole/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance/genetics', 'Fura-2', 'Ionomycin/pharmacology', 'Leukemia P388/genetics/*metabolism', 'Lipids/isolation & purification', 'Phosphatidylcholines/*metabolism', 'Potassium Chloride/pharmacology', 'Tamoxifen/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Valinomycin/pharmacology', 'Verapamil/*pharmacology']",1991/05/15 00:00,1991/05/15 00:01,['1991/05/15 00:00'],"['1991/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/05/15 00:01 [medline]', '1991/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']","['0006-2952(91)90561-I [pii]', '10.1016/0006-2952(91)90561-i [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1991 May 15;41(10):1455-61. doi: 10.1016/0006-2952(91)90561-i.,"['0 (Lipids)', '0 (Phosphatidylcholines)', '094ZI81Y45 (Tamoxifen)', '2001-95-8 (Valinomycin)', '56092-81-0 (Ionomycin)', '64ALC7F90C (Dipyridamole)', '660YQ98I10 (Potassium Chloride)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)', 'KOO5CM684H (Digitonin)', 'N91BDP6H0X (Choline)', 'TSN3DL106G (Fura-2)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since the stimulatory effect of HL-60 conditioned medium is only observed in the absence of exogenous transferrin we have assayed HL-60 cells for the production of transferrin and found that they produce polypeptides which react with transferrin antibodies. 35S-methionine labelling, immunoprecipitation and subsequent separation by SDS-gel electrophoresis reveals the presence of a major transferrin related 41 +/- 2 kDa species released by HL-60 cells. Physiological levels of iron salts completely abolish the requirement of exogenous transferrin which indicates that the endogenous transferrin related polypeptides in the presence of exogenous inorganic iron salts are sufficient for the proliferation of HL-60 cells provided insulin or related growth factors are present.

Each parameter was estimated in cells concomitantly exposed to the drug for 24-48 hr. More than 0.1 microM of DWA2114R markedly inhibited cell proliferation as well as DNA synthesis, and it decreased in mitotic index in a concentration-dependent manner. One microM of DWA2114R decreased DNA synthesis by 80% in the cells treated for 24 hr, while the inhibition of RNA synthesis was less than 40%. A significant inhibition of protein synthesis was caused only by treatment with a high concentration (100 microM) of the drug. Under complete cytostatic conditions (10 microM of DWA2114R), cell volume markedly increased and about 40% of the total cells were polynucleate. In addition, flow cytometrical analysis revealed that most of these cells were accumulated in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle, and a new peak located in the G2/M phase of tetraploid cells emerged. On the other hand, the cells treated with 100 microM of the drug did not increase in volume and their progress in the cell cycle was almost completely blocked.","['Akamatsu, K', 'Endo, K', 'Matsumoto, T', 'Morikawa, K', 'Koizumi, M', 'Mitsui, H', 'Koizumi, K']","['Akamatsu K', 'Endo K', 'Matsumoto T', 'Morikawa K', 'Koizumi M', 'Mitsui H', 'Koizumi K']","['Exploratory Research Laboratories, Chugai Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Gotemba, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Carboplatin/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis/drug effects', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L1210/pathology', 'Mice']",1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Res. 1991 Jan-Feb;11(1):151-5.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '103775-75-3 (DWA 2114)', 'BG3F62OND5 (Carboplatin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Eight cases of pathologically proven fungal sinusitis were identified. All patients were undergoing chemotherapy for either acute myeloblastic leukemia or acute lymphoblastic leukemia and had neutrophil counts less than 100 cells/mm3. The most common findings were fever, facial pain, and abnormal sinus radiographs. Surveillance cultures of the upper aerodigestive system did not reliably predict sinus pathogens. An aggressive treatment approach consisting of early administration of amphotericin B (intravenously and via catheter irrigations of the sinuses) and surgical drainage is advocated.

After the induction of general anesthesia, all patients were loaded with 10 mL/kg of a 6% high-molecular dextran solution (Macrodex--Pharmacia), which resulted in a significant preoperative decrease in hematocrit (Hct) from 32% +/- 6% to 28% +/- 5% (hypervolemic hemodilution) and also allowed the procedure to be performed without systemic heparinization. The blood aspirated during the harvest (24 +/- 6 mL/kg; mean +/- SD) was replaced with a solution of 6% dextran and Ringer's acetate solution, and the Hct decreased from 28% +/- 5% to a minimum of 18% +/- 3%. Immediately after the harvest, 10 mL/kg of homologous packed red blood cells was transfused, increasing Hct to 25% +/- 3%. Oxygen saturation in the superior caval vein (ScvO2) decreased from 79% +/- 4% before the harvest to 70% +/- 3% (P less than 0.01) at the end of it, and then increased to 74% +/- 3% after the transfusion of homologous packed red blood cells. There was a strong linear correlation between mean values for Hct and ScvO2 during the various stages (r = 0.99). Mean heart rate decreased gradually during the procedure, from 106 +/- 10 to 86 +/- 7 beats/min. There was no significant change in arterial pressure, but cardiac output measured by impedance cardiography was about 30% greater during harvesting than during undisturbed anesthesia.

Moreover, a constant negativity to HLA-DR and CD15 antigens in M3 and the contemporaneous expression of HLA-DR and CD11b antigens on the M4 and M5 leukemic cells were observed. We identified phenotypically distinct groups of patients with different responses to therapy. In fact, patients whose leukemic cells did not express the HLA-DR antigen showed, in a univariate analysis, a significantly higher percentage of complete remissions than did HLA-DR-positive patients. Multivariate discriminant analysis, in line with this result, showed that the parameters of discriminant capacity were, in order of statistical significance, young age, low WBC count and the lack of DR expression, respectively. A trend for a better response to therapy, without any statistical relevance, was also observed in CD11b-negative and CD33-positive cases. Similar results were detected in patients who expressed either DR or CD11b, or none of these markers. These findings indicate that immunophenotype may identify some FAB subtypes.

Screening a cDNA library from one rat T-cell lymphoma with this genomic probe yielded 15 cDNA clones which were derived from 10 different genes. One of these genes, defined by the cDNA clone pRcT7a, was expressed as a 1.8-kb mRNA transcript in spleen and thymus but not in other normal rat tissues. Expression of the gene defined by the pRcT7a cDNA clone in a series of MoMuLV-induced rat T-cell lymphomas showed a perfect correlation with the expression of the rat leukocyte antigen MRC OX-44. Because of this observation, the pRcT7a clone was sequenced and it was shown to identify a gene coding for a 219-amino-acid protein. The homology between pRcT7a and the Tpl-1 probe used for its detection mapped within the 3' untranslated region of the pRcT7a cDNA clone. The pRcT7a protein, which exhibits four putative transmembrane regions and three putative glycosylation sites, contains a region which is nearly identical in sequence to a peptide derived from the rat leukocyte antigen MRC OX-44. This finding suggested that the pRcT7a cDNA clone defines the gene coding for OX-44. To confirm this finding, a pRcT7a construct in the retrovirus vector pZipNeo was introduced into the OX-44- T-cell lymphoma line 2788. Immunostaining with the MRC OX-44 monoclonal antibody followed by flow cytometry revealed that following gene transfer, the 2788 cells became OX-44+. Sequence comparisons revealed that pRcT7a/MRC OX-44 is a member of a family of genes which includes the melanoma-specific antigen ME491; the human leukocyte antigen CD37; the protein TAPA-1, which is expressed on the surface of human T cells and appears to be involved in growth regulation; the human gastrointestinal tumor antigen CO-029; and the Schistosoma mansoni-associated antigen Sm23.","['Bellacosa, A', 'Lazo, P A', 'Bear, S E', 'Tsichlis, P N']","['Bellacosa A', 'Lazo PA', 'Bear SE', 'Tsichlis PN']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19111.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', '*Antigens, CD', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/*genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/physiology', 'DNA/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Gene Library', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma/microbiology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Protein Conformation', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred F344', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Tetraspanin 25', 'Transfection']",1991/05/01 00:00,1991/05/01 00:01,['1991/05/01 00:00'],"['1991/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/mcb.11.5.2864-2872.1991 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1991 May;11(5):2864-72. doi: 10.1128/mcb.11.5.2864-2872.1991.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (CD53 protein, human)', '0 (Cd53 protein, rat)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Tetraspanin 25)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",,,,"['CA-06927/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-38047/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'RR-05539/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",PMC360073,,"['GENBANK/M57276', 'GENBANK/M64822', 'GENBANK/M64823', 'GENBANK/M64824', 'GENBANK/M64825', 'GENBANK/M64826', 'GENBANK/M64827', 'GENBANK/X55123', 'GENBANK/X56930', 'GENBANK/X56931']",,,,,,,,,

The consequences of polyamine depletion and the concomitant analog replacement of these pools were compared on two cellular DNA targets, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and a defined nuclear DNA episome present in 935.1 mouse fibroblasts. The spermidine analog, BESPD, depleted cellular putrescine and spermidine pools, but not spermine pools, and had no effect on either DNA target. Treatment with the corresponding analog of spermine, BESPM, resulted in a near-total depletion of all three polyamine pools and a greater than 80% reduction in the cellular content of mtDNA, without affecting the levels of the nuclear episome. Topological forms analysis by Southern blotting of mtDNA and episomal DNA from BESPM-treated cells failed to reveal any forms interconversion, indicating the absence of analog-induced single- or double-strand break damage to either DNA target. The growth-dependent loss of mtDNA is consistent with a rapid cessation of mtDNA replication and subsequent dilution of existing mtDNA copies by cell division. Similar decreases in polyamine pools and mtDNA were also observed in L1210 cells treated with BESPM. When a comparable level of polyamine depletion was produced in L1210 cells by specific enzyme inhibitors, there was no effect on the cellular content of mtDNA, and BESPD was not rendered capable of decreasing mtDNA levels. Because the analogs are structurally similar to the naturally occurring polyamines and would be expected to have similar binding properties, the loss in mtDNA may reflect dysfunctional replacement by BESPM at spermine-specific binding sites in the mitochondrion.","['Vertino, P M', 'Beerman, T A', 'Kelly, E J', 'Bergeron, R J', 'Porter, C W']","['Vertino PM', 'Beerman TA', 'Kelly EJ', 'Bergeron RJ', 'Porter CW']","['Department of Experimental Therapeutics, Grace Cancer Drug Center, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, New York 14263.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'DNA/drug effects/*metabolism', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA, Mitochondrial/drug effects/*metabolism', 'DNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'DNA, Superhelical/drug effects/metabolism', 'Electrophoresis, Agar Gel', 'Fibroblasts/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Polyamines/*pharmacology', 'Spermidine/analogs & derivatives/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Spermine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Time Factors']",1991/04/01 00:00,1991/04/01 00:01,['1991/04/01 00:00'],"['1991/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 1991 Apr;39(4):487-94.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA, Mitochondrial)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA, Superhelical)', '0 (Polyamines)', '2FZ7Y3VOQX (Spermine)', '61345-84-4 (N(1), N(12)-diethylspermine)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', '97141-40-7 (N(1),N(8)-diethylspermidine)', 'U87FK77H25 (Spermidine)']",,,,"['CA-22153/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-28495/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-37606/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

This assay was performed in polystyrene Terasaki microtest plates instead of 96-well microtiter plates, using hematopoietic cells attached to the wells by air drying. This method facilitates washing procedures and reduces the radioactive waste. The specificity of this IPA method is as high as those of RIAs and ELISAs generally used. Titration curves of a McAb, My7, specific for CD13 on HL60 and TPA-treated HL60 (HL60-TPA) cells, were linear between the 10(-1) and 10(-4) dilutions. A difference in the CD13 expression between HL60 and HL60-TPA cells could be detected by both IPA and flow cytometry using My7 at 10(-1)-10(-3) dilutions. At the 10(-3) dilution, however, CD13 expressed on HL60 cells was detected by the IPA method but not by flow cytometry. These results show that the sensitivity of IPA is superior to that of flow cytometry. By screening hybridoma clones with this IPA method, we succeeded in producing three interesting and useful McAbs (21H73, 37G7 and 49C12) against K562 cell surface antigens whose expression was altered after the differentiation induced by TPA. We also demonstrated that the IPA method is suitable for cell surface marker analysis of leukemia cells freshly isolated from patients.","['Kubota, Y', 'Tanaka, T', 'Iida-Tanaka, K', 'Irino, S']","['Kubota Y', 'Tanaka T', 'Iida-Tanaka K', 'Irino S']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Kagawa Medical School, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*analysis/biosynthesis/immunology', 'Antigens, Surface/*immunology', 'Blast Crisis/immunology', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*immunology', 'Humans', '*Iodine Radioisotopes', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/immunology/pathology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Protein Binding', 'Radioimmunoassay/methods', '*Staphylococcal Protein A/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/immunology']",1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0145-2126(91)90086-9 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Res. 1991;15(2-3):73-9. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(91)90086-9.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Iodine Radioisotopes)', '0 (Staphylococcal Protein A)']",,,,,,['Leuk Res. 1992;16(5):549.

Blast cells from 10 cases of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and 5 cases of acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL) were incubated with 5 x 10(-8) M [3H] 5-formyltetrahydrofolate (5-formylTHF) for 18 h to label intracellular folate pools, which were subsequently quantitated by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). In AML, 5-methylTHF made up 53% of the total folate pool followed by 10-formylTHF (26%), 5-formylTHF (10%), THF (9%) and DHF (1%). Cells from ALL differed from AML (p less than 0.05) with respect to 10-formylTHF (17%) and DHF (10%). Exposure to nitrous oxide (8 h) caused an equal decrease of 10-formylTHF and 5-formylTHF in both AML (30%) and ALL (45%), whereas 5-methylTHF increased (130%). Methotrexate (4 h, 10(-6) M) caused an accumulation of DHF and a decrease of 5-methylTHF in both AML (32%) and ALL (12%). A specific reduction of the 10-formylTHF (50%) and 5-formylTHF (25%) pools was noticed in ALL. Exposure to nitrous oxide prior to methotrexate treatment aggravated the reduction of 10-formylTHF and 5-formylTHF presumably by impaired replenishment from the 5-methylTHF pool. In conclusion, this study demonstrates a significant difference in folate coenzyme distribution between cells from AML and ALL. Moreover it is shown that nitrous oxide and methotrexate treatment of leukemic cells cause an accumulation of 5-methylTHF and DHF respectively at the expense of other folate forms. The presence of substantial amounts of DHF in cells from ALL together with the specific reduction of 10-formylTHF (necessary for purine synthesis) during MTX treatment may in part explain the efficacy of methotrexate in the treatment of ALL.","['Ermens, A A', 'Schoester, M', 'Lindemans, J', 'Abels, J']","['Ermens AA', 'Schoester M', 'Lindemans J', 'Abels J']","['Institute of Hematology, Erasmus University, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,IM,"['5-Methyltetrahydrofolate-Homocysteine S-Methyltransferase/*metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Folic Acid/metabolism', '*Folic Acid Antagonists', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*enzymology/metabolism/pathology', 'Methotrexate/*pharmacology', 'Nitrous Oxide/*pharmacology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*enzymology/metabolism/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/enzymology/metabolism', 'Vitamin B 12/metabolism']",1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0145-2126(91)90098-e [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Res. 1991;15(2-3):165-71. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(91)90098-e.,"['0 (Folic Acid Antagonists)', '935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)', 'EC 2.1.1.13 (5-Methyltetrahydrofolate-Homocysteine S-Methyltransferase)', 'K50XQU1029 (Nitrous Oxide)', 'P6YC3EG204 (Vitamin B 12)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This decreased activity is due to an inhibition by Ara-CTP of the ligase-adenylate complex generation, the crucial step in the action of this enzyme. The activity of the semi-purified ligase as well as the formation of ligase-adenylate complex are decreased in the presence of Ara-CTP. These results demonstrate that Ara-C via its active form Ara-CTP inhibits DNA ligase activity through the inhibition of the ligase-adenylate complex.

Agents which influence homeobox gene expression are thus of great interest in the study of human leukemias. Retinoic acid has direct regulatory actions on homeobox gene transcription (TIBS 158, 52, 1989; Differentiation 37, 773, 1988) and can induce select human leukemia cell lines to undergo terminal differentiation in vitro (Proc. natl Acad.

Some of the teratogenic effects are duplicated by the drug Thalidomide (Embryopathic Activity of Drugs, Little Brown, Boston, p. 167, 1965; Haematological Cytology, Wolf Med. Pub.

To investigate Thalidomide for other retinoid-like effects, we exposed cultures of human leukemia K562 cells to the metabolites generated in a Thalidomide hepatic-microsomal enzyme drug metabolizing system (Proc. natl Acad.

Anti-TNF Abs optimized in vitro hematopoiesis in 11 out of 15 B-CLL patients and a significant growth increase in all types of colonies was noted as compared to baseline cultures (p less than 0.05). In patients with stage IV disease, the increase in both mixed and erythroid colonies was more prominent than in patients with earlier disease stages. This optimization of growth was also observed in normal control cultures containing accessory cells. However, high TNF levels were measured in conditioned media from CLL patients and suppressed normal bone marrow hematopoietic progenitors growth. In contrast no TNF was detected in normal conditioned media.

To address the possible influence of the viral enhancer sequences on expression from the internal promoter, we have constructed high-titer, self-inactivating retrovirus vectors which delete viral regulatory sequences upon integration in the host genome. We show that deleting most of the viral enhancer sequences has no significant effect on viral titer. This enhancer deletion leads to either an increase or a decrease in the amount of RNA transcribed from the internal promoter, but no consistent change can be found with any type of vector. The same changes in expression from the internal promoter observed in embryonic stem cells are also observed in 3T3 fibroblast cells, in which the viral promoter is active.

Here, utilizing the baculovirus expression system, we purified HTLV type II (HTLV-II) Rex from the cytoplasmic fraction of recombinant baculovirus-infected insect cells by heparin-agarose chromatography. We directly demonstrated that Rex specifically bound HTLV-II 5' long terminal repeat RNA in both gel mobility shift and immunobinding assays. Sequences sufficient for Rex binding were localized to the R-U5 region of the HTLV-II 5' long terminal repeat and correlate with the region required for Rex function. The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), has an analogous regulatory protein, Rev, which directly binds to and mediates its action through the Rev-responsive element located within the HIV-1 env gene. We demonstrated that HTLV-II Rex rescued an HIV-1JR-CSF Rev-deficient mutant, although inefficiently.

The chemical-alkylating activities and hydrolytic behavior of these compounds, as well as their antitumor activities without radiation, were found to be comparable to those of other 2,2-dimethylphosphoraziridines, while their in vitro radiosensitizing activities were at low concentrations generally comparable to that of misonidazole, with compound 8 showing superior activity. At higher concentrations, only compound 10 was sufficiently soluble and nontoxic to the cells for evaluation in this assay. Thus, the bis(2,2-dimethyl-1-aziridinyl) phosphinyl moiety does not seem to have contributed to the hypoxic radiosensitizing activities (only to the cytotoxicities) of the electron-affinic moieties in this in vitro assay. In comparison, the prototype 2,2-dimethylphosphoraziridine, ethyl [bis(2,2-dimethyl-1-aziridinyl) phosphinyl]carbamate (AB-132), showed at nontoxic doses no radiosensitizing activity in this assay, and at cytotoxic doses increased the cell-killing effect of each given dose of X-radiation additively under both hypoxic and oxic conditions. Conversely, only the 2,2-dimethylphosphoraziridine moiety appeared to participate in the moderate ""therapeutic radiation-potentiating"" activity indicated by compound 10 in the in vivo experiment using the P388 leukemia model (on day 1), as the misonidazole standard was inactive in this nonhypoxic system. Clearly, the mechanism of the in vivo observed radiation-potentiating effect of AB-132 and other 2,2-dimethylphosphoraziridines is different from that of the hypoxic radiosensitizers, but the possible synergism between the two biologically active moieties of the new compounds could not be demonstrated with the experimental models so far employed.","['Perlman, M E', 'Dunn, J A', 'Piscitelli, T A', 'Earle, J', 'Rose, W C', 'Wampler, G L', 'MacDiarmid, J E', 'Bardos, T J']","['Perlman ME', 'Dunn JA', 'Piscitelli TA', 'Earle J', 'Rose WC', 'Wampler GL', 'MacDiarmid JE', 'Bardos TJ']","['Department of Medicinal Chemistry, State University of New York at Buffalo, Amherst 14260.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry,9716531,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*chemical synthesis', 'Aziridines/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Indicators and Reagents', 'Leukemia P388/drug therapy/radiotherapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Molecular Structure', 'Nitroimidazoles/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Organophosphorus Compounds/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Radiation-Sensitizing Agents/*chemical synthesis', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",1991/04/01 00:00,1991/04/01 00:01,['1991/04/01 00:00'],"['1991/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/jm00108a024 [doi]'],ppublish,J Med Chem. 1991 Apr;34(4):1400-7. doi: 10.1021/jm00108a024.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Aziridines)', '0 (Indicators and Reagents)', '0 (Nitroimidazoles)', '0 (Organophosphorus Compounds)', '0 (Radiation-Sensitizing Agents)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Treatment was continued for up to 18 months to maximal response. Of the 122 eligible patients, 60 received C + P, while 62 received CVP. With a median follow-up of 7 years, there were no significant differences in survival (4.8 v 3.9 years, P = .12), complete remission (CR) rate (25% v 23%; P = .83), or duration of response (2.0 v 1.9 years; P = .78) between C + P and CVP. Toxicity was modest despite the prolonged treatment. The long median survival of 4.1 years for stage III and IV patients is superior to that usually reported. This could stem from continuing treatment to maximal response rather than an increase in intensity of therapy. These results are comparable to those reported with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP) therapy by other investigators. The data suggest that intermittent C + P administered to maximal response continues to be the standard treatment approach for advanced CLL.","['Raphael, B', 'Andersen, J W', 'Silber, R', 'Oken, M', 'Moore, D', 'Bennett, J', 'Bonner, H', 'Hahn, R', 'Knospe, W H', 'Mazza, J']","['Raphael B', 'Andersen JW', 'Silber R', 'Oken M', 'Moore D', 'Bennett J', 'Bonner H', 'Hahn R', 'Knospe WH', 'Mazza J', 'et al.']","['New York University Medical Center, NY 10016.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Chlorambucil/administration & dosage', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Analysis', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",1991/05/01 00:00,1991/05/01 00:01,['1991/05/01 00:00'],"['1991/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1991.9.5.770 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1991 May;9(5):770-6. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1991.9.5.770.,"['18D0SL7309 (Chlorambucil)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)']",,,,"['CA 16395/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 21115/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 23318/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Moreover, by examining the V gene usage in strains congenic at the Igh locus, we also determined that the strain-specific factor was encoded by sequences lying outside of the Igh locus. We decided to examine whether there are differences in Vh gene rearrangement between alleles in an F1 strain. To do this analysis we chose to examine the relative Ig H chain V region gene usage of pre-B cell lines derived from (C57BL/6 x BALB/c)F1 fetal liver cells by Southern blot analysis. We found a high frequency of Vh-gene rearrangements (77% of the alleles had VDJ rearrangements) and these rearrangements occurred to Vh-genes throughout the Vh locus and were not confined to the D-proximal Vh-genes as has been previously observed with lines from other mouse strains. The Vh-gene usage pattern is similar on both alleles indicating that at least one of the determinants of which Vh-gene is used is trans-acting and acts similarly on each allele. Furthermore, one allele, Ighb (donated by the C57BL/6 parent), rearranged Vh-genes more frequently than the other allele, Igha (donated by the BALB/c parent) suggesting that one of the determinants of Vh-gene rearrangement may be acting in an allele-specific manner.","['Atkinson, M J', 'Michnick, D A', 'Paige, C J', 'Wu, G E']","['Atkinson MJ', 'Michnick DA', 'Paige CJ', 'Wu GE']","['Department of Immunology, University of Toronto, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['*Abelson murine leukemia virus', 'Alleles', 'Animals', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Probes', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Heavy Chain/*immunology', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Light Chain/*immunology', 'Gestational Age', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*genetics', 'Liver Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Mice']",1991/04/15 00:00,1991/04/15 00:01,['1991/04/15 00:00'],"['1991/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/04/15 00:01 [medline]', '1991/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1991 Apr 15;146(8):2805-12.,['0 (DNA Probes)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A better response rate after more aggressive chemotherapy was evident also in elderly patients. CR rate was 81% in patients below 60 yr of age who had no antecedent blood disorder and who had had symptoms for less than 3 months. Other variables with prognostic implications were: cytogenetic subgroup, antecedent hematological disease, and level of serum ferritin. High serum ferritin was associated with short CR duration.

Promonocytic U937 cells were incubated with each of three inducing agents, namely, interleukin-6, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate. The cells were examined at 24, 48, and 72 h during the induction periods and their doubling time and mean AgNOR score were calculated. After 72 h, the cells were maintained in culture for a further 24 h in the absence of an inducing agent and these parameters were determined again. It was found that whereas the unstimulated U937 cells had a mean value in the region of 50 AgNORs per nucleus, this diminished to about 20 after a 72 h incubation, but rose to 30 or more when the inducing agents had been withdrawn for 24 h. These observation confirm the results of previous studies using melanoma and HL60 cell lines: however, it has now been demonstrated that a variety of agents can modulate the numbers of fibrillar centers in a very similar way in a single cell line. Furthermore, we have shown that the ""undifferentiated"" U937 cell AgNOR score recovers when the agents no longer act upon the cells; this implies that fibrillar center numbers are intimately related to differentiation state in cell lines, as in the case in, for example, tumor specimens.","['Edwards, S', 'Afford, S', 'Crocker, J']","['Edwards S', 'Afford S', 'Crocker J']","['Department of Histopathology, East Birmingham Hospital, Bordesley Green East, England.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,IM,"['Cell Count/drug effects', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacology', 'Histocytochemistry/methods', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/*pharmacology', 'Interphase/*drug effects', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/metabolism/*pathology', 'Nucleolus Organizer Region/*drug effects/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Silver', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1991/05/01 00:00,1991/05/01 00:01,['1991/05/01 00:00'],"['1991/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0014-4827(91)90139-L [pii]', '10.1016/0014-4827(91)90139-l [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 1991 May;194(1):118-21. doi: 10.1016/0014-4827(91)90139-l.,"['0 (Interleukin-6)', '3M4G523W1G (Silver)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Receptor-mediated activation of this enzyme occurs via a guanine nucleotide regulatory protein (G-protein), designated Gp. We have compared the stimulation of this enzyme by fMet-Leu-Phe via the G-protein in HL60 membranes and in permeabilised cells. fMet-Leu-Phe stimulated phospholipase C in membranes at 2 min and the response was dependent on exogenously added GTP. GTP alone also stimulated phospholipase C activity such that at 10 min the response to fMet-Leu-Phe was minimal. In comparison, the response to fMet-Leu-Phe in permeabilised cells was greater in extent but did not require added GTP. However, it was antagonized by GDP analogues (GDP[beta S] greater than GDP greater than dGDP) and by pertussis toxin pretreatment, indicating that fMet-Leu-Phe-stimulated phospholipase C activity was also mediated via Gp. GTP and its analogue GTP[gamma S] also stimulated phospholipase C and their effects were strictly additive to the stimulation obtained with fMet-Leu-Phe. Such additivity was also observed when two receptor-directed agonists, fMet-Leu-Phe and ATP, were used to stimulate intact cells. It is concluded that (a) the size of the response with fMet-Leu-Phe in membranes is limited by the loss of a component, possibly phospholipase C, and (b) stoichiometry and physical organisation of multiple species of G-proteins and/or phospholipases C may explain the independent nature of phospholipase C activation by fMet-Leu-Phe, ATP and guanine nucleotides.","['Stutchfield, J', 'Cockcroft, S']","['Stutchfield J', 'Cockcroft S']","['Department of Physiology, University College London, England.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Biochem,European journal of biochemistry,0107600,IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/pharmacology', 'Bacterial Proteins', 'Calcium/pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/enzymology', 'Cell Membrane Permeability', 'Guanine Nucleotides/pharmacology', ""Guanosine 5'-O-(3-Thiotriphosphate)/pharmacology"", 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine/*pharmacology', 'Pertussis Toxin', 'Receptors, Formyl Peptide', 'Receptors, Immunologic/metabolism', 'Streptolysins/*pharmacology', 'Type C Phospholipases/*metabolism', 'Virulence Factors, Bordetella/pharmacology']",1991/04/10 00:00,1991/04/10 00:01,['1991/04/10 00:00'],"['1991/04/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/04/10 00:01 [medline]', '1991/04/10 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1432-1033.1991.tb15889.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Biochem. 1991 Apr 10;197(1):119-25. doi: 10.1111/j.1432-1033.1991.tb15889.x.,"['0 (Bacterial Proteins)', '0 (Guanine Nucleotides)', '0 (Receptors, Formyl Peptide)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Streptolysins)', '0 (Virulence Factors, Bordetella)', '0 (streptolysin O)', ""37589-80-3 (Guanosine 5'-O-(3-Thiotriphosphate))"", '59880-97-6 (N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 2.4.2.31 (Pertussis Toxin)', 'EC 3.1.4.- (Type C Phospholipases)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Throughout the work, BsAbs were constructed by thioether-linking the hinges of two Fab'gamma, one from monoclonal anti-L2C-idiotype antibody and the other from anti-saporin antibody. The latter was either affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal or one of a panel of five mouse monoclonal antibodies. In vitro cytotoxicity studies showed that, though all derivatives were effective, the BsAb made with the polyclonal antibody was always 10 to 20 times more potent than those made with a monoclonal antibody in yielding 50% inhibition of [3H]leucine uptake. This superior activity could be matched by selective mixtures of two or more of the monoclonal derivatives. Furthermore, in immunotherapeutic delivery of saporin to tumor, a pair of BsAbs performed significantly better than did either individually. Binding and uptake studies with radiolabeled saporin demonstrated a 20-fold increase in functional affinity when saporin was held at the cell surface by an appropriate BsAb mixture rather than by a single BsAb. In contrast, only small differences were recorded in the rate at which saporin was internalized as a result of the same maneuver. We conclude that the improved performance of combinations of BsAbs arises from their ability to provide multiple linkages between saporin molecules and cell surfaces, significantly increasing the functional affinity with which saporin is tethered to the cell, but, in this system at least, having only a minor effect on the rate at which it is internalized. Cocktails of two or more BsAbs, selected to bind to multiple epitopes on ribosome-inactivating proteins and perhaps also on unwanted cells, could provide an important new strategy in immunotherapy.","['French, R R', 'Courtenay, A E', 'Ingamells, S', 'Stevenson, G T', 'Glennie, M J']","['French RR', 'Courtenay AE', 'Ingamells S', 'Stevenson GT', 'Glennie MJ']","['Lymphoma Research Unit, Tenovus Laboratory, General Hospital, Southampton, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology/*therapeutic use', 'Antibody Affinity/*immunology', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/immunology/metabolism/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Synergism', 'Guinea Pigs', 'Immunoglobulin Fab Fragments/immunology/*therapeutic use', 'Immunotoxins/immunology/metabolism/*therapeutic use', 'Iodine Radioisotopes/pharmacokinetics', 'Leucine/pharmacokinetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred CBA', '*N-Glycosyl Hydrolases', 'Plant Proteins/immunology/metabolism/*therapeutic use', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/immunology/metabolism/therapy', 'Ribosome Inactivating Proteins, Type 1', 'Saporins', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1991/05/01 00:00,1991/05/01 00:01,['1991/05/01 00:00'],"['1991/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1991 May 1;51(9):2353-61.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Fab Fragments)', '0 (Immunotoxins)', '0 (Iodine Radioisotopes)', '0 (Plant Proteins)', '0 (Ribosome Inactivating Proteins, Type 1)', 'EC 3.2.2.- (N-Glycosyl Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.2.2.22 (Saporins)', 'GMW67QNF9C (Leucine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Interestingly, DMDC was effective against colon 26 murine carcinoma, M5076 murine reticulum cell sarcoma, LX-1 human lung cancer xenograft, and SK-Mel-28 human melanoma xenograft, which are less sensitive or refractory to ara-C, while DMDC was not more potent against murine leukemias P388 and L1210 than ara-C. The in vitro cytotoxic effects of DMDC and ara-C against L1210 leukemia cells were prevented dose dependently by deoxycytidine, suggesting that DMDC, like ara-C, may require phosphorylation by deoxycytidine kinase for antitumor activity.

In Patient 2, highly elevated BCGF and IgM-specific BCDF was secreted by T-cells, a mechanism leading to IgM hypergammaglobulinemia in this patient.

Multiple regression analysis showed that function was lower in autotransplant patients than in allorecipients, and lower in male patients for all three functional assays. Patients with clinically significant infection tended to have lower proliferative function in both transplant groups and lower cytotoxic function in the allotransplant population. Graft-versus-host disease was associated with lower T-cell function, but was present only in the allotransplant group; therefore, it cannot account for the even lower levels of function observed in the autotransplant population. Because we observe deficits in T-cell regeneration in autotransplant recipients that are even more severe than in allorecipients, we postulate that cellular immunodeficiency after bone marrow transplantation may reflect limitations in thymic-dependent repopulation rather than an effect of genetic disparity between host and donor (eg, clinical or subclinical graft-versus-host).","['Miller, R A', 'Daley, J', 'Ghalie, R', 'Kaizer, H']","['Miller RA', 'Daley J', 'Ghalie R', 'Kaizer H']","['Department of Pathology, Boston University School of Medicine, MA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*immunology', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Graft vs Host Reaction', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/surgery', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/surgery', 'Regression Analysis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1991/04/15 00:00,1991/04/15 00:01,['1991/04/15 00:00'],"['1991/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/04/15 00:01 [medline]', '1991/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)81586-9 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1991 Apr 15;77(8):1845-50.,,,,,"['AG-00115/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-42148/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

We studied the antileukemic effect of (1) Single-cycle complement-mediated lysis by two different monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) (M195 [CD33] and F23 [CD13] 40 micrograms/mL), reactive with distinct antigens found on early myeloid cells and monocytes, used alone and in combinations; (2) 4-Hydroperoxycyclophosphamide (4-HC) (80 mumol/L or 100 mumol/L) alone; or (3) combined with VP-16 (5 micrograms/mL) and (4) a cocktail of 1 through 3 as above (combined immunochemotherapy). More than 4 logs of HL-60 tumor cell elimination were observed after 1 hour of incubation with both MoAbs plus 4-HC + VP-16 while the single treatment (immunotherapy or chemotherapy) provided 1.5 and 3.5 logs of colony-forming inhibition, respectively. When the same protocols were tested on cryopreserved leukemic cells from eight patients with AML, we observed a mean value of CFU-L inhibition of 92.3% +/- 2.5% SD, 95.5% +/- 1.4% SD, and 99% +/- 0.8% SD after MoAbs and complement lysis, 4-HC, and 4-HC + VP-16 treatment, respectively. The combined treatment of MoAbs and 4-HC + VP-16 produced more than 3-log reduction of CFU-L colony formation. By comparison, the mean recovery of committed normal bone marrow progenitors after incubation with MoAbs and complement was 12% for CFU-granulocyte-macrophage (CFU-GM), 22.9% for burst-forming unit erythroid (BFU-E), and the recovery following 4-HC + VP-16 treatment was 4.4% for CFU-GM and 5.6% BFU-E. In subsequent experiments, highly purified CD34+ blast cells, enriched by positive selection, and stimulated in liquid culture by cytokines (interleukin-1 [IL-1], IL-3, and combination of both) or MO-conditioned medium (MoCM), demonstrated that immunochemotherapy spares hematopoietic colony-forming cells earlier than day 14 CFU-GM, in vitro.","['Lemoli, R M', 'Gasparetto, C', 'Scheinberg, D A', 'Moore, M A', 'Clarkson, B D', 'Gulati, S C']","['Lemoli RM', 'Gasparetto C', 'Scheinberg DA', 'Moore MA', 'Clarkson BD', 'Gulati SC']","['Laboratory of Hematopoietic Cell Kinetics, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10021.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*therapeutic use', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation/immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Cyclophosphamide/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Etoposide/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppression Therapy', 'Interleukin-1/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",1991/04/15 00:00,1991/04/15 00:01,['1991/04/15 00:00'],"['1991/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/04/15 00:01 [medline]', '1991/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)81584-5 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1991 Apr 15;77(8):1829-36.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '1XBF4E50HS (4-hydroxycyclophosphamide)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At the beginning of secondary treatment, 320 patients (75%) had rash, 252 (59%) had liver dysfunction, and 228 (53%) had gut dysfunction. Secondary treatment was with glucocorticoids (n = 249), cyclosporine (n = 80), antithymocyte globulin (n = 114), or monoclonal antibody (n = 19) either singly (n = 390) or in combination (n = 37). Parameters of GVHD severity were recorded weekly, and responses were determined according to values at the initiation of tertiary treatment or, for patients without such treatment, using values on day 29 of secondary treatment or the last recorded values before death, whichever occurred first. Minimal criteria for improvement or deterioration were defined for each organ, but no attempt was made to define liver or gut outcome if another complication such as venocclusive disease or infectious enteritis was present. Improvement or resolution of GVHD in the respective organ was seen in 45% of patients with skin disease, 25% of patients with evaluable liver disease, and in 35% of patients with evaluable gut disease. Overall complete or partial responses were seen in 40% of patients. The highest complete response rate with secondary therapy (23%) was seen when GVHD recurred during the taper phase of primary glucocorticoid treatment and was managed by increasing the dose of glucocorticoids. Multivariate analyses were performed to identify patient, disease, or treatment factors associated with likelihood of complete response or overall improvement. A similar analysis was performed to identify covariates associated with time to treatment failure (defined as initiation of tertiary therapy or death not due to relapse of malignancy). Severe dysfunction in the skin, liver, and gut at the beginning of treatment was associated both with a decreased likelihood of complete response and an increased treatment failure rate. The times to treatment failure and the proportions of patients in various response categories were similar for primary and secondary treatment, suggesting that the potential efficacy of new immunosuppressive agents for treatment of acute GVHD can be assessed meaningfully in patients who have not responded adequately to initial therapy.","['Martin, P J', 'Schoch, G', 'Fisher, L', 'Byers, V', 'Appelbaum, F R', 'McDonald, G B', 'Storb, R', 'Hansen, J A']","['Martin PJ', 'Schoch G', 'Fisher L', 'Byers V', 'Appelbaum FR', 'McDonald GB', 'Storb R', 'Hansen JA']","['Division of Clinical Research, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA 98104.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adult', 'Anemia, Aplastic/*surgery', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation/immunology/physiology', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/immunology/mortality/*therapy', 'Humans', '*Immunosuppression Therapy', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia/*surgery', 'Lymphocyte Depletion', 'Male', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1991/04/15 00:00,1991/04/15 00:01,['1991/04/15 00:00'],"['1991/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/04/15 00:01 [medline]', '1991/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)81583-3 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1991 Apr 15;77(8):1821-8.,['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)'],,,,"['CA 15704/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 18029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 18221/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

We show that addition of all-trans retinoic acid (RA) or 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D3 (D3) induces AML-193 cells to differentiate into the granulocytic or monocytic lineage, respectively. On the other hand, addition of either G- or M-CSF alone exerts virtually no differentiative effect. Terminal granulocytic or monocytic differentiation was observed when AML-193 cells were treated with RA and G-CSF, or D3 and M-CSF, respectively, as evaluated by cell morphology, analysis of surface antigens, and phagocytic functions. These positive interactions indicate that the differentiating activity of G- and M-CSF on leukemic cells may be unmasked by preliminary treatment with RA and D3, respectively, ie, the physiologic inducers override the leukemic differentiation blockade and CFSs exert their differentiative activity on the unblocked leukemic cells. These preliminary observations on a single cell line may pave the way for the designing of clinical protocols combining physiologic inducer(s) and hematopoietic growth factor(s) in the treatment of acute leukemia.","['Valtieri, M', 'Boccoli, G', 'Testa, U', 'Barletta, C', 'Peschle, C']","['Valtieri M', 'Boccoli G', 'Testa U', 'Barletta C', 'Peschle C']","['Department of Hematology-Oncology, Istituto Superiore di Sanita, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Calcitriol/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Clone Cells', 'Cytokines/*pharmacology', 'Drug Interactions', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacology', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology']",1991/04/15 00:00,1991/04/15 00:01,['1991/04/15 00:00'],"['1991/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/04/15 00:01 [medline]', '1991/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)81581-X [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1991 Apr 15;77(8):1804-12.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '81627-83-0 (Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Controls were 64 healthy subjects. The CSF-1 concentration was correlated with the type of disease, status of the disease, treatment status, and hematologic parameters. CSF-1 concentration was significantly elevated in 83.5% of the patients with active disease, and for each active disease group it was significantly greater (P less than .0001) than in the control. Thus, the high circulating CSF-1 concentration was not associated with a particular malignant phenotype or MDS subtype, but did correlate with the disease activity of both NHL and HD, and the tumor burden in MM, AML, and CLL. There was no correlation of the CSF-1 level with total counts of monocytes or neutrophils in patients with MDS or other malignancies. The cellular basis for the elevated circulating CSF-1 was not investigated.

This interaction is dependent, at least in part, on direct cell to cell contact or cellular adhesion to extracellular matrix proteins. Long-term bone marrow cultures (LTMC) provide an appropriate microenvironment for maintenance of primitive hematopoietic stem cells and a means of analyzing this stem cell-stromal cell interaction in vitro. Although LTMC have been successfully generated from murine and human bone marrow, only limited success has been reported in a primate system. In addition, few permanent stromal cell lines are available from nonmurine bone marrow. Because the primate has become a useful model for large animal bone marrow transplant studies and, more specifically, retroviral-mediated gene transfer analysis, we have generated immortalized bone marrow stromal cell lines from primate bone marrow using gene transfer of the Simian virus large T (SV40 LT) antigen. At least one stromal cell line has demonstrated the capacity to maintain early hematopoietic cells in long-term cultures for up to 4 weeks as measured by in vitro progenitor assays. Studies were undertaken to characterize the products of extracellular matrix biosynthesis and growth factor synthesis of this cell line, designated PU-34. In contrast to most murine bone marrow-derived stromal cell lines capable of supporting hematopoiesis in vitro that have been examined, the extracellular matrix produced by this primate cell line includes collagen types I, laminin. Growth factor production analyzed through RNA blot analysis, bone marrow cell culture data, and factor-dependent cell line proliferation assays includes interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-7, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), G-CSF, M-CSF, leukemia inhibitory factor, and a novel cytokine designated IL-11. This immortalized primate bone marrow stromal cell line may be useful in maintaining early progenitor cells for experimental manipulation without the loss of reconstituting capacity and as a potential source of novel hematopoietic growth factors.","['Paul, S R', 'Yang, Y C', 'Donahue, R E', 'Goldring, S', 'Williams, D A']","['Paul SR', 'Yang YC', 'Donahue RE', 'Goldring S', 'Williams DA']","[""Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Children's Hospital, Boston, MA 02115.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/*physiology', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Culture Media', 'DNA Probes', 'DNA Replication/drug effects', 'Extracellular Matrix/physiology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Growth Substances/genetics/pharmacology', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/drug effects/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1/pharmacology', 'Macaca', 'Mice']",1991/04/15 00:00,1991/04/15 00:01,['1991/04/15 00:00'],"['1991/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/04/15 00:01 [medline]', '1991/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)81570-5 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1991 Apr 15;77(8):1723-33.,"['0 (Culture Media)', '0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",,,,"['5 K08 HL01554-02/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', '5T32 HL07574/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA39542-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

This minor structural modification results in a more lipophilic compound with a unique metabolite that has a prolonged plasma half-life as well as in vitro and in vivo antileukemia activity. To determine its activity in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), 130 consecutive adult patients between the ages of 16 and 60 with newly diagnosed disease were randomized in a single institution study to receive either IDR in combination with cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C) or standard therapy with daunorubicin (DNR) and Ara-C. The trial was analyzed using the O'Brien-Fleming multiple testing design that allowed for periodic inspection of the data at specific patient accession points. After accrual of 60 patients per arm, analysis showed that patients who received IDR/Ara-C had a superior response compared with those who received standard therapy: 48 of 60 patients (80%) achieved complete remission on the former arm compared with 35 of 60 patients on the latter (58%, P = .005). Logistic regression analysis of factors associated with complete response indicated that treatment with IDR/Ara-C offered a significant advantage to patients who presented with a high initial white blood cell count compared with treatment with DNR/Ara-C. The degree of marrow aplasia was approximately the same on each arm as was nonhematologic toxicity. Overall survival for patients on the IDR/Ara-C arm was 19.5 months compared with 13.5 months on the DNR/Ara-C arm (P = .025) at a median follow-up of 2.5 years.

Emission kinetics of fura-2 in single cells.,186-202,"A microscope based time-correlated single photon counting instrument has been constructed to measure fluorescence intensity and emission anisotropy decays from fluorophores in single cells on a nanosecond time scale. The sample is excited and the emission collected using epi-illumination optics with frequency-doubled pulses from the cavity-dumped output of a synchronously pumped dye laser serving as an excitation source. Collection of decays from a single cell is possible due to the presence of an iris in the emission path that can be reduced to less than the diameter of a single cell. Using the instrument the decay of 60 nM 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene was measured, demonstrating that adequate data for lifetime analysis can be recorded from fewer 10(3) molecules of the fluorophore in an illuminated volume of 23 fl. In addition, the intensity and anisotropy decays of fura-2 in single adherent cells and in suspensions of fura-2 loaded cells in suspension, although the relative amplitudes and decay constants vary somewhat from cell to cell.

A critical study.,562-70,"This paper critically examines the redox activity of K562 cells (chronic myelogenous leukemia cells) and normal peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL). Ferricyanide reduction, diferric transferrin reduction, and ferric ion reduction were measured spectrophotometrically by following the time-dependent changes of absorbance difference characteristic for ferricyanide disappearance and for the formation of ferrous ion:chelator complexes. Bathophenanthroline disulfonate (BPS) and ferrozine (FZ) were used to detect the appearance of ferrous ions in the reaction mixtures when diferric transferrin or ferric reduction was studied. Special attention was devoted to the analysis of time-dependent absorbance changes in the presence and absence of cells under different assay conditions. It was observed and concluded that: (i) FZ was far less sensitive and more sluggish than BPS for detecting ferrous ions at concentrations commonly used for BPS; (ii) FZ, at concentrations of at least 10-times the commonly used BPS concentrations, seemed to verify the results obtained with BPS; (iii) ferricyanide reduction, diferric transferrin reduction and ferric ion reduction by both K562 cells and peripheral blood lymphocytes did not differ significantly; and (iv) earlier values published for the redox activities of different cells might be overestimated, partly because of the observation published in 1988 that diferric transferrin might have loosely bound extra iron which is easily reduced. It is suggested that the specific diferric transferrin reduction by cells might be considered as a consequence of (i) changing the steady-state equilibrium in the diferric transferrin-containing solution by addition of ferrous ion chelators which effectively raised the redox potential of the iron bound in holotransferrin, and (ii) changing the steady-state equilibrium by addition of cells which would introduce, via their large and mostly negatively charged plasma membrane surface, a new phase which would favor release and reduction of the iron in diferric transferrin by a ferric ion oxidoreductase. The reduction of ferricyanide is also much slower than activities reported for other cells which may indicate reduced plasma membrane redox activity in these cells.","['Berczi, A', 'Sizensky, J A', 'Crane, F L', 'Faulk, W P']","['Berczi A', 'Sizensky JA', 'Crane FL', 'Faulk WP']","['Center for Reproduction and Transplantation Immunology, Methodist Hospital of Indiana, Indianapolis 46202.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,IM,"['Ferricyanides/metabolism', 'Ferrozine', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*metabolism', 'Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'NADH, NADPH Oxidoreductases/metabolism', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Phenanthrolines', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Spectrophotometry', 'Transferrin/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1991/04/09 00:00,1991/04/09 00:01,['1991/04/09 00:00'],"['1991/04/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/04/09 00:01 [medline]', '1991/04/09 00:00 [entrez]']","['0304-4165(91)90231-5 [pii]', '10.1016/0304-4165(91)90231-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1991 Apr 9;1073(3):562-70. doi: 10.1016/0304-4165(91)90231-5.,"['0 (Ferricyanides)', '0 (Phenanthrolines)', '0 (Transferrin)', '0 (diferric transferrin)', '28048-33-1 (Ferrozine)', '28061-20-3 (bathophenanthroline disulfonic acid)', 'EC 1.6.- (NADH, NADPH Oxidoreductases)', 'EC 1.6.99.- (diferric transferrin reductase)', 'U4MAF9C813 (potassium ferricyanide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Each of these compounds has the capacity both to intercalate and alkylate DNA. Dialysis measurements reveal a relatively high affinity for calf thymus DNA, being about 10(5) M-1 at ionic strength 0.01. Incubating calf thymus DNA-ligand complexes having a ligand-to-basepair ratio of 0.4 at 37 degrees C for 18 h leads to maximum alkylation levels of about one ligand molecule bound irreversibly per 40 basepairs. The reactivity of these compounds towards DNA is chain-length dependent, the n-decyl compound, for example, requiring about 10-times the ligand-to-basepair input ratio of the n-hexyl derivative to reach the same level of alkylation. The limited degree of alkylation is a consequence of conversion of the alkylbromides to the less reactive alkylchlorides in the buffer medium. The results of DNA sequencing experiments indicate that the n-hexyl derivative alkylates at guanines occurring in 5'-GT-3' sequences and in runs of guanines [(Gp)n]. The corresponding n-decyl compound, on the other hand, is highly selective for guanines in 5'-GT-3' sequences only and also reacts weakly with some adenines.

We further determined whether NK-250 and NK-252 among the six compounds could potentiate cytocidal activities of etoposide (VP16) as well as VCR against both multidrug-resistant (MDR) cell line (VJ-300) and atypical MDR cell line (KB/VM-4).

NK-250 and NK-252 potentiated the cytotoxic action of VCR about 2- to 10-fold against KB and KB/VM-4 cells, and they almost completely reversed VCR-resistance in VJ-300 cells. By contrast, NK-250 and NK-252 potentiated the cytotoxic action of VP16 about 2-fold against KB cells while they reversed 5- to 10-fold VP16-resistance in both VJ-300 and KB/VM-4 cells. The reversal effect by NK-250 and NK-252 of VCR-resistance in VJ-300 cells appeared to be due to enhanced cellular accumulation of radioactive VCR through interaction to 170-kDa P-glycoprotein. The potentiation effects by these dihydropyridines of VCR and VP16 on KB or KB/VM-4 cells also appeared to be due to enhanced accumulation of radioactive VP16 or VCR, but the effects might be mediated through other mechanisms, plausibly enhanced cellular uptake of the drugs.","['Watanabe, Y', 'Takano, H', 'Kiue, A', 'Kohno, K', 'Kuwano, M']","['Watanabe Y', 'Takano H', 'Kiue A', 'Kohno K', 'Kuwano M']","['Department of Biochemistry, Oita Medical School, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Anticancer Drug Des,Anti-cancer drug design,8603523,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dihydropyridines/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Dioxins/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance', 'Drug Synergism', 'Etoposide/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Fluid/metabolism', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Tritium', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vincristine/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology/toxicity']",1991/02/01 00:00,1991/02/01 00:01,['1991/02/01 00:00'],"['1991/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Drug Des. 1991 Feb;6(1):47-57.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Dihydropyridines)', '0 (Dioxins)', '10028-17-8 (Tritium)', '126444-09-5 (NK 250)', '126444-11-9 (NK 252)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '7M8K3P6I89 (1,4-dihydropyridine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because CD4+ cells help to coordinate efficient immune responses, some of the defects in the immune function in advanced cases of AIDS may be explained by the disappearance of these cells. Therefore, an understanding of the mechanisms used by HIV to induce the reduction of CD4+ cells is important. Here we use a Moloney murine leukaemia virus-based retroviral vector in order to express the nef gene of HIV-1 in three lymphocytic cell lines expressing CD4. In all cases we find that cell-surface CD4 expression is inversely related to nef expression. However, nef does not alter steady-state levels of CD4 RNA or CD4 protein. Also, nef can downregulate a CD4 triple mutant (Ser----Ala) that is neither phosphorylated nor down-regulated by phorbol esters, indicating that nef is acting by a different mechanism.","['Garcia, J V', 'Miller, A D']","['Garcia JV', 'Miller AD']","['Program in molecular Medicine, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington 98104.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Nature,Nature,0410462,IM,"['Antigens, CD/genetics/metabolism', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology/microbiology', 'CD4 Antigens/analysis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Down-Regulation', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', '*Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Gene Products, nef/*genetics/physiology', 'Genetic Vectors', 'HIV/*genetics', 'HIV Long Terminal Repeat', 'Humans', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Monocytes/immunology/microbiology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Phosphoserine/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/microbiology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Transfection', 'nef Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus']",1991/04/11 00:00,1991/04/11 00:01,['1991/04/11 00:00'],"['1991/04/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/04/11 00:01 [medline]', '1991/04/11 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/350508a0 [doi]'],ppublish,Nature. 1991 Apr 11;350(6318):508-11. doi: 10.1038/350508a0.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD4 Antigens)', '0 (Gene Products, nef)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (nef Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus)', '17885-08-4 (Phosphoserine)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,['nef'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, it has been emphasized that the attachment of hemopoietic cells to stromal cells is the first step in this process and that this is necessary in hemopoiesis in vitro. A rosette formation technique was developed to quantitatively measure this attachment. The murine leukemic cell line ELM-D, which grows only in close contact with stromal cells, was used to represent hemopoietic cells. Rosettes were formed with about 75% of the normal murine bone marrow derived hemopoietic supportive stromal cells (MS-1). However, ELM-D formed rosettes with only 15% of the hemopoietic non-supportive stromal cells (MS-K). The maximum rosette formation was obtained at an ELM-D to MS-1 ratio of 20:1. When MS-1 and MS-K were mixed and seeded as stromal cells, MS-K did not alter the attachments of ELM-D to MS-1; the percentage of rosette formation increased in parallel with the increase in the number of MS-1 cells in the stromal layer. These findings suggest that MS-K does not have an inhibitory effect.

Initial studies indicated that TBI did not directly inactivate the virus, suggesting that irradiation either acted on the target cells for virus replication or on other cells mediating the effect. We have now examined the effect of this relatively low dose TBI on replication, transcription, and protein expression of the Friend virus. Northern blot analysis revealed that in FVC infected mice treated with curative low dose TBI, no spleen focus-forming virus (SFFV)-specific mRNA species were detected. Southern blot analysis revealed that a 6.0 kb SFFV fragment could be detected in infected, untreated spleen cells, but not in cells from FVC-infected mice treated with TBI, or in uninfected spleen cells. Western blot analysis revealed that the SFFV envelope glycoprotein was expressed in the spleen cells from untreated FVC infected mice, but not in the cells from TBI treated FVC infected mice. These results, consistent with our previous findings of greatly reduced spleen focus forming units in mice with FVC which had been treated with this regimen of TBI, suggest the possibility of using such treatments in other retroviral associated disorders.","['Shen, R N', 'Lu, L', 'Harrington, M A', 'Srivastava, C', 'Kim, Y J', 'Zhou, S Z', 'Wu, B', 'Ruscetti, S', 'Broxmeyer, H E']","['Shen RN', 'Lu L', 'Harrington MA', 'Srivastava C', 'Kim YJ', 'Zhou SZ', 'Wu B', 'Ruscetti S', 'Broxmeyer HE']","['Department of Medicine Hematology/Oncology, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis 46202-5121.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Blotting, Western', 'DNA, Viral/*radiation effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/genetics/*radiation effects', 'Leukemia, Experimental/genetics/microbiology/*radiotherapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'RNA, Messenger/*radiation effects', 'RNA, Viral/genetics/*radiation effects', 'Retroviridae Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Spleen Focus-Forming Viruses/genetics/*radiation effects', '*Whole-Body Irradiation']",1991/03/01 00:00,1991/03/01 00:01,['1991/03/01 00:00'],"['1991/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1991 Mar;5(3):225-9.,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins)']",,,,"['CA 36464/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 36740/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

The overall frequency of clonal chromosome aberrations was 36% (50% in PV, 30% in MFS, 27% in IT, and 17% in UCMPD). The frequency was markedly higher (53%) in the subset of patients who had received myelosuppressive therapy and/or had developed acute leukemia prior to the initial cytogenetic analysis.

Studies using an irreversible inhibitor of the enzyme.,551-6,"A potent irreversible inhibitor of S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) decarboxylase, S-(5'-adenosyl)-methylthio-2-aminooxyethane (AdoMeSaoe), was used to study the regulatory control of this key enzyme in the polyamine biosynthetic pathway. Treatment of L1210 cells with the inhibitor completely eradicated the growth-induced rise in AdoMet decarboxylase activity, resulting in a marked decrease in cellular content of spermidine and spermine. The putrescine content, on the other hand, was greatly elevated. Although no detectable AdoMet decarboxylase activity was found in the L1210 cells after treatment with AdoMeSaoe, the cells contained 50-fold higher amounts of AdoMet decarboxylase protein, compared to untreated cells during exponential growth. Part of this increase was shown to be due to elevated synthesis of the enzyme. This stimulation appeared to be related to the decrease in cellular spermidine and spermine content, since addition of either one of the polyamines counteracted the rise in AdoMet decarboxylase synthesis. The synthesis rate was determined by immunoprecipitation of labeled enzyme after a short pulse with [35S]methionine. In addition to a protein that co-migrated with pure rat AdoMet decarboxylase (Mr approximately 32,000), the antibody precipitated a somewhat larger labeled protein (Mr approximately 37,000) that most likely represents the proenzyme form. Treatment of the L1210 cells with AdoMetSaoe also gave rise to a marked stabilization of the decarboxylase which contributed to the increase in its cellular protein content. Addition of spermidine did not significantly affect this stabilization, whereas the addition of spermine reduced the half-life of the enzyme to almost that of the control cells.","['Autelli, R', 'Stjernborg, L', 'Khomutov, A R', 'Khomutov, R M', 'Persson, L']","['Autelli R', 'Stjernborg L', 'Khomutov AR', 'Khomutov RM', 'Persson L']","['Department of Physiology, University of Lund, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Biochem,European journal of biochemistry,0107600,IM,"['Adenosylmethionine Decarboxylase/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Biogenic Polyamines/biosynthesis', 'Leukemia L1210/*enzymology', 'Mice', 'Ornithine Decarboxylase/biosynthesis']",1991/03/28 00:00,1991/03/28 00:01,['1991/03/28 00:00'],"['1991/03/28 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/03/28 00:01 [medline]', '1991/03/28 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1432-1033.1991.tb15849.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Biochem. 1991 Mar 28;196(3):551-6. doi: 10.1111/j.1432-1033.1991.tb15849.x.,"['0 (Biogenic Polyamines)', 'EC 4.1.1.17 (Ornithine Decarboxylase)', 'EC 4.1.1.50 (Adenosylmethionine Decarboxylase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Given that the 5' and 3' ends of the CBL2 gene are not known and are probably not evaluated by the v-cbl probe, these results do not rule out the possibility of CBL2 involvement in the pathogenesis of a subset of acute leukemias possessing a t(4;11), B-cell lymphomas possessing a t(11;14), or Ewing sarcomas possessing a t(11;22).","['Savage, P D', 'Shapiro, M', 'Langdon, W Y', 'Geurts van Kessel, A D', 'Seuanez, H N', 'Akao, Y', 'Croce, C', 'Morse, H C 3rd', 'Kersey, J H']","['Savage PD', 'Shapiro M', 'Langdon WY', 'Geurts van Kessel AD', 'Seuanez HN', 'Akao Y', 'Croce C', 'Morse HC 3rd', 'Kersey JH']","['Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota, School of Medicine, Minneapolis.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Switzerland,Cytogenet Cell Genet,Cytogenetics and cell genetics,0367735,IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Chromosome Mapping', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 4', 'Cricetinae', 'Humans', 'Hybrid Cells', 'Leukemia/genetics', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-cbl', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Sarcoma, Ewing/genetics', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', '*Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases']",1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1159/000133062 [doi]'],ppublish,Cytogenet Cell Genet. 1991;56(2):112-5. doi: 10.1159/000133062.,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-cbl)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 6.3.2.- (CBL protein, human)']",,['CBL2'],,"['CA-250917/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-39860/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-49721/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

The complex was formed at a 2:1 molar ratio between the lipids and MTO, with phosphatidic acid (PA) being the strongest complex-forming lipid. Weaker complexes and lower incorporation rates of MTO resulted when liposomes containing dicetylphosphate, phosphatidyl inositol, phosphatidyl serine, phosphatidyl glycerol, oleic acid, and tridecylphosphate were used. Thus, all further experiments were performed with PA-MTO liposomes that contained 0.1-3 mg MTO/ml and had mean vesicle sizes of 40-150 nm, depending on the drug concentration and the method of liposome preparation. In vitro incubations of free and liposomal MTO with human plasma showed that the drug is slowly transferred from the liposome membranes to the plasma proteins. For liposomal MTO a transfer rate of 48% was determined, whereas 75.8% of free MTO was bound to the plasma proteins. The organ distribution of the two preparations in mice showed that higher and longer-lasting concentrations of liposomal MTO were found in the liver and spleen. The terminal elimination halflives in the liver were 77 h for liposomal MTO and 14.4 h for free MTO. In the blood, slightly higher concentrations were detected for liposomal MTO, which also had slower biphasic elimination kinetics as compared with the free drug. Drug distribution in the heart was not significantly different from that in the kidneys. The LD25 of PA-MTO liposomes in mice was 19.6 mg/kg and that of free MTO was 7.7 mg/kg. The antitumor effects of PA-MTO liposomes were evaluated in murine L1210 leukemia, in various xenografted human tumors, and in methylnitrosourea-induced rat mammary carcinoma. Generally, the liposomal application form was more effective and less toxic than the free drug. The cytostatic effects were dependent on the tumor model, the application schedule, and the drug concentration. At doses that were toxic when free MTO was used, the liposomal preparation produced strong antitumor effects in some cases. In summary, the incorporation of MTO into liposomes changes the drug's plasma-binding properties, alters its organ distribution, reduces its acute toxicity, and increases its cytostatic efficiency in various tumor models. The liposomal PA-MTO complex represents a new application form of MTO that has advantageous properties.","['Schwendener, R A', 'Fiebig, H H', 'Berger, M R', 'Berger, D P']","['Schwendener RA', 'Fiebig HH', 'Berger MR', 'Berger DP']","['Institute of Pathology, Experimental Pathology, University Hospital, University of Zurich, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects', 'Drug Carriers', 'Female', 'Half-Life', 'Humans', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy', 'Liposomes', 'Male', 'Mammary Neoplasms, Experimental/drug therapy', 'Membranes', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred ICR', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Mice, Nude', 'Mitoxantrone/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/drug therapy', 'Phosphatidic Acids/therapeutic use', 'Tissue Distribution']",1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00685156 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 1991;27(6):429-39. doi: 10.1007/BF00685156.,"['0 (Drug Carriers)', '0 (Liposomes)', '0 (Phosphatidic Acids)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As determined by the MTT assay, the growth-inhibitory effect of DXR was approx. 40 times lower when cell density was increased from 10(6) to 10(8) cells/ml (positive inoculum effect), whereas little or no influence of cell density was observed in CDDP-induced cell-growth inhibition. As measured by high-performance liquid chromatography using a fluorescence detector, the cellular accumulation of DXR showed 6- and 18-fold decreases after 1 h incubation when the cells were concentrated from 10(6) to 10(7) and 10(8) cells/ml, respectively. Only at low cell density (10(6) cells/ml) did the amount of DXR in the cells increase with increasing exposure times of up to 6 h. The DXR concentration in the supernatant that was separated from a cell suspension showing a density of 10(8) cells/ml fell to 20% of that obtained at 10(6) cells/ml. The metabolites of DXR, including Adriamycinol and Adriamycinone, were not detectable in the cell extracts or supernatants at any cell density examined. In contrast, the cellular accumulation of CDDP calculated from the platinum concentration, which was measured with a flameless atomic absorption spectrophotometer, was essentially identical at all cell densities examined; moreover, extension of the exposure period resulted in a linear increase in the amount of CDDP in the cells. CDDP concentrations in the supernatants were equally retained, irrespective of cell densities. These observations indicate that the positive inoculum effect shown in DXR-induced cell-growth inhibition results from the decreased cellular accumulation of the drug at high cell densities. We found no influence for cell density on the cellular accumulation of CDDP that might be relevant to the therapeutic potentiation of this drug at high tumor-cell density.","['Takemura, Y', 'Kobayashi, H', 'Miyachi, H', 'Hayashi, K', 'Sekiguchi, S', 'Ohnuma, T']","['Takemura Y', 'Kobayashi H', 'Miyachi H', 'Hayashi K', 'Sekiguchi S', 'Ohnuma T']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, National Defense Medical College, Saitama, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,IM,"['Cell Count/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Cisplatin/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Doxorubicin/analogs & derivatives/metabolism/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Naphthacenes/pharmacokinetics', 'Platinum/pharmacokinetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*metabolism/pathology', 'Spectrophotometry, Atomic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism/pathology']",1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00685154 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 1991;27(6):417-22. doi: 10.1007/BF00685154.,"['0 (Naphthacenes)', '24385-10-2 (adriamycin aglycone)', '49DFR088MY (Platinum)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'HUH05KI4CF (adriamycinol)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to assess whether ras oncogenes are also involved in childhood leukaemias, we have used polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and synthetic oligonucleotide probes to study the nature and frequency of ras gene mutations in childhood leukaemias, concentrating largely on the acute myeloid leukaemias (AML). Thirty-four childhood presentation AML DNAs were screened for mutations in and around codons 12, 61 and 117 of N-, K- and H-ras. Eight of these samples (24%) contained ras mutations. As in the adult disease, the gene predominantly involved was N-ras (6/8), with occasional activation of K-ras (2/6). The most common base change was a G----A transition at codon 12 or 13 (4/8). Of the patients with mutant ras, 4/8 were diagnosed as AML FAB subtype M5. Five of the 34 childhood AMLs analysed displayed abnormalities of chromosome 7. However, none of these cases contained a mutant ras gene. One AML patient was studied at relapse, 14 months after initial presentation. The presentation mutation (N61p3) was not detectable, although a new mutation (N13Cys) was readily identified. This observation extends our original finding with presentation and relapse samples of adult AML, in which it was uncommon for the relapse sample to contain the same ras mutation as the presentation DNA. In addition, two out of five patients diagnosed as juvenile CML, were found to harbour mutant ras.","['Farr, C', 'Gill, R', 'Katz, F', 'Gibbons, B', 'Marshall, C J']","['Farr C', 'Gill R', 'Katz F', 'Gibbons B', 'Marshall CJ']","['Institute of Cancer Research, Chester Beatty Laboratories, London.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', '*Genes, ras', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', 'Male', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction']",1991/03/01 00:00,1991/03/01 00:01,['1991/03/01 00:00'],"['1991/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1991.tb08578.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1991 Mar;77(3):323-7. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1991.tb08578.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thirteen out of 16 individuals (81%) were restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) heterozygous for DXS255. DNA methylation status could not be assessed in the three DXS255 homozygous individuals. In eight DXS255 heterozygous individuals clonality was clearly demonstrated using M27 beta and in six of these cases independent analysis using T cell receptor (TcR) and immunoglobulin (Ig) gene probes confirmed the presence of clonal tumour cell populations. In the two controls, polyclonality was inferred from M27 beta probe analysis. In the remaining three cases (all acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL)) both DXS255 X chromosome sequences appeared to be methylated. Clonality in these cases was demonstrated by TcR or Ig monoclonal gene rearrangements.

In five patients the large cell lymphoma represented a transformation of a preceding low grade, small cell lymphoproliferative disease. Three other patients with T-lineage large cell lymphoma presented with skin infiltration (two cases) or lymphoma-associated nephrotic syndrome (one case) 3-9 months before leukaemia occurred. The other 16 patients (12 B-lineage and four T-lineage) presented with de novo large cell leukaemia/lymphoma. With the exception of skin infiltration, clinical features did not differ between T and B-lineage cases. Prognosis was generally poor although a minority of patients lived 1-2 years. Median survival was 7 months. In the B-cell lymphomas immunological markers were those expected but among the T-cell cases there were many unusual immunophenotypes with frequent failure to express markers which are usually positive in peripheral T cells. Without the availability of immunological markers diagnosis would have been difficult, with acute myeloid leukaemia being the most important differential diagnosis. T-lineage and B-lineage cases could not be distinguished on cytological features. In the majority of cases the cells were very pleomorphic with nuclear lobulation, prominent nucleoli and marked cytoplasmic basophilia being commonly observed.

We administered 5 micrograms/m2 daily by subcutaneous injection to 29 such patients increasing the dose in patients who did not show a haematologic response. Doses of 5 or 10 micrograms/m2 ('low-dose GM-CSF') produced an increase in neutrophils in 14/29 patients. Response was significantly (P = 0.03) more frequent in patients who had a higher pre-treatment neutrophil count (e.g. 11/16 in patients with greater than or equal to 0.5 x 10(9)/l). A rise in blasts followed administration of low-dose GM-CSF in five patients, all with either refractory anaemia with excess blasts (RAEB) or refractory anaemia with excess blasts in transformation (RAEBT). Platelets decreased in five patients, four of whom had no change in blasts, reverting to baseline when GM-CSF was discontinued. We and others have previously observed similar rises in blasts or decreases in platelets at doses of 120 micrograms/m2 daily. Low-dose GM-CSF produced no constitutional side effects. Our results suggest that low doses of GM-CSF might be initially employed in neutropenic patients with myelodysplastic syndromes who present with pretreatment neutrophil counts greater than 0.5 x 10(9)/l.

We have developed a simple, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based method for detecting IgH gene rearrangement which relies on the observation that by using a panel of PCR amplimers specific for each of the six heavy chain variable region families in conjunction with a common joining region amplimer, clonal rearrangement can be detected in over 90% of cases of B lymphoid malignancy. By using radiolabelled amplimers and exploiting the size heterogeneity resulting from independent IgH rearrangement events, we show that high resolution gel electrophoresis can be used to generate a 'fingerprint' representing the spectrum of B cell clonality in complex populations of B lymphocytes. The method effectively scans the entire IgH gene rearrangement repertoire and is capable of detecting rare clonal or oligoclonal B lymphoid cell populations. In normal bone marrow mononuclear cells, clonal IgH rearrangement could be readily detected at a sensitivity of 10(-3). We illustrate the application of the method in assessing the spectrum of B cell clonality occurring in an autoimmune condition.

Because palmar flexion creases develop in the embryo at the same time as the blood-forming cells, and because both arise from mesodermal tissue, insults to the embryo that may lead to leukemic changes in the blood-forming cells may also result in aberrant palmar crease patterns. This study investigated the relationship between aberrant palmar creases and ALL in children who developed leukemia at age 6 years or younger. Odds ratios and chi squares demonstrated significant differences in bilateral aberrant palmar creases between ALL children and relatives (P less than .025). Differences were not explained by familial clustering of aberrant creases. These results support the theory that the insult occurred during pregnancy, probably in the first trimester. There were no significant differences in either bilateral or unilateral aberrant palmar creases between ALL children and their siblings. All children with bilateral aberrant creases had a higher incidence of central nervous system involvement (50%) than those without bilateral aberrant creases (6%).

The two-drug combination of HO-221 with cyclophosphamide (CPA), adriamycin (ADM), mitomycin C (MMC), vindesine (VDS), vincristine (VCR) or etoposide showed remarkable synergistic effects with 60-days survivors. However, the combination chemotherapy with antimetabolites, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and methotrexate (MTX) showed competitive effects.

Whey samples from apparently healthy glands either did not inhibit lymphocyte DNA synthesis or inhibited it to a lesser degree than did whey from mastitic glands. Degree of inhibition was dose-dependent. The molecules causing inhibition were noncytotoxic and underwent minimal binding to the lymphocytes. Inhibitory molecules were susceptible to various proteolytic and glycolytic enzymes, indicating a glycoprotein-like structure. Whey inhibited incorporation of thymidine if it was in the cell cultures during the early stages of stimulation. Incubation of lymphocytes in whey that inhibited thymidine incorporation did not affect DNA synthesis in subsequent culturing of the same cells without whey.

We examined 17 cases of T-cell lymphoma or leukemia; a clone was identified in 13 cases (76%) overall and in 7 of 8 cases (87.5%) in which both beta-chain alleles were known to be rearranged, as shown by restriction enzyme analysis.

Accordingly, in the present study we examined the hypothesis that treatment with cytosine arabinoside (ARA-C) to reduce the leukemic cell load coupled with Imuvert would be more effective than either given alone. Treatment with ARA-C-Imuvert aborted the development of chloroleukemia in 79% of the animals in contrast to 0%, 9% and 45% in animals treated with buffer, ARA-C, or Imuvert respectively.

Treating JURKAT cells with the phorbol ester tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate (TPA) inhibited their proliferation and induced expression of the gene for the interleukin 2 receptor alpha chain (IL2R-alpha), consistent with previous reports. In unstimulated proliferating JURKAT cells, high levels of C-MYC, N-RAS, and BCL2 mRNAs were found that diminished rapidly following TPA-induced cessation of growth. In contrast, accumulation of mRNAs for the C-FOS, C-JUN, and EGR-1 genes increased markedly in TPA-treated cells and preceded the induction of IL2R-alpha mRNA. Expression of C-MYB, C-RAF-1, C-LCK, C-FYN, and C-FGR proto-oncogenes was relatively unchanged. To explore directly the function of two of these protooncogenes in regulating the growth of JURKAT T cells, we stably transferred C-MYC and BCL2 expression plasmids into these cells. Despite sustained expression of C-MYC, BCL2, or the combination of these protooncogenes, TPA continued to inhibit JURKAT cell growth and to induce IL2R expression. Thus, although C-MYC and BCL2 proto-oncogene expression correlated with proliferation in TPA-treated JURKAT cells, continuous over-expression of even the combination of these oncogenes was insufficient for abrogating the effects of TPA in these leukemic T cells. Because human lymphoid malignancies frequently contain chromosomal translocations that deregulate the expression of C-MYC and BCL2, our findings could have relevance for attempts to induce terminal differentiation of leukemic cells by in vitro exposure of patients' bone marrow cells to phorbol esters.","['Makover, D', 'Cuddy, M', 'Yum, S', 'Bradley, K', 'Alpers, J', 'Sukhatme, V', 'Reed, J C']","['Makover D', 'Cuddy M', 'Yum S', 'Bradley K', 'Alpers J', 'Sukhatme V', 'Reed JC']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia 19104.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['Blotting, Northern', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*genetics/pathology', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Plasmids', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/genetics', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1991/03/01 00:00,1991/03/01 00:01,['1991/03/01 00:00'],"['1991/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncogene. 1991 Mar;6(3):455-60.,"['0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,"['BCL2', 'C-FGR', 'C-FOS', 'C-FYN', 'C-JUN', 'C-LCK', 'C-LYN', 'C-MYB', 'C-MYC', 'C-RAF-1', 'C-SRC', 'C-YES', 'EGR-1', 'N-RAS']",,['CA47956/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The cytotoxic activity does not require the Fc region of the incorporated antibody molecules and shows more lytic potential than ordinary antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. By complement-mediated cell depletion and Percoll gradient separation, the effector cell populations for surrogate receptor-mediated cellular cytotoxicity are found to be natural killer cells, as in the murine system.

Nine children with NHL with an onset time of treatment between 4 and 9 years of age (mean 6.5 years) were studied with annual body measurements taken from the time of the diagnosis and thereafter annually during the following 4 years. None of the children received cranial irradiation. During the first treatment year a significantly low mean height velocity was observed (-1.4 standard deviation score [SDS]) for the NHL group. The consecutive two 1 year periods showed a normalization of the mean height velocity. For the group of children with ALL, there was a more prominent negative effect on height during the first 2 years of treatment than for the NHL group in the present study. After the cessation of therapy, the children with NHL showed a reduced catch-up growth compared with the children with ALL. The explanation offered is that cranial irradiation has a heavier impact on growth than chemotherapy during the first 2 years of treatment, but an intense chemotherapy during the maintenance period could have a considerable impact in blunting growth.","['Marky, I', 'Samuelsson, B O', 'Mellander, L', 'Karlberg, J']","['Marky I', 'Samuelsson BO', 'Mellander L', 'Karlberg J']","['Department of Pediatrics I, Gothenburg University, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Med Pediatr Oncol,Medical and pediatric oncology,7506654,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Body Height/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Body Weight/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Brain/radiation effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Growth/*radiation effects', 'Humans', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/drug therapy/*physiopathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*physiopathology/radiotherapy', 'Time Factors']",1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/mpo.2950190205 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Pediatr Oncol. 1991;19(2):96-9. doi: 10.1002/mpo.2950190205.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There was considerable generation of ethane, and this was dependent on cell number and Fe2+ concentration; it was eliminated by antioxidants and augmented by ascorbic acid. The assay was sensitive and reproducible; ethane was detected when as little as 0.03% of the cellular n-3 (omega-3) fatty acids were peroxidized. To gain further understanding we used a lipid modification model that allows study of cells enriched with fatty acids of different degrees of unsaturation. The quantity of ethane generated was greatest by cells modified with fatty acids of the n-3 family, and there was a high direct correlation of percentage of n-3 fatty acids contained in cellular lipids with peroxidation as measured by ethane generation. Ethane generation was more sensitive in detecting peroxidation than loss of polyunsaturated fatty acids.

Down-regulation of LDL receptors occurred in macrophages at lower LDL concentrations than in THP-1 cells. Phorbol ester-treated THP-1 cells stored more cholesteryl esters than human macrophages in response to 25-200 micrograms/ml of acetylated LDL. Because we have previously demonstrated that activated platelets enhanced macrophage cholesteryl ester storage, we examined the ability of THP-1 cells to store cholesteryl esters in response to coculture with platelets. Compared with macrophages, dividing THP-1 cells and phorbol ester-treated THP-1 cells accumulated only 50% and 33% as much cholesteryl esters, respectively. Furthermore, although platelets induced a 90% reduction in cholesterol synthesis in macrophages by day 5, cholesterol synthesis in THP-1 cells and phorbol ester-treated THP-1 cells was inhibited less than 50% by platelets. Nevertheless, both THP-1 cells and macrophages responded to platelets by increasing their secretion of apolipoprotein E. Therefore, we conclude that dividing THP-1 cells and phorbol ester-treated THP-1 cells are capable of forming foam cells in response to physiologic doses of both LDL and acetylated LDL, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Banka, C L', 'Black, A S', 'Dyer, C A', 'Curtiss, L K']","['Banka CL', 'Black AS', 'Dyer CA', 'Curtiss LK']","['Department of Immunology, Research Institute of Scripps Clinic, La Jolla, CA 92037.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Lipid Res,Journal of lipid research,0376606,IM,"['Apolipoproteins E/metabolism', 'Blood Platelets/*metabolism', 'Cholesterol/biosynthesis', 'Cholesterol Esters/metabolism', 'Esterification', 'Foam Cells/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Lipoproteins, LDL/*metabolism', 'Receptors, LDL/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0022-2275(20)42241-2 [pii]'],ppublish,J Lipid Res. 1991 Jan;32(1):35-43.,"['0 (Apolipoproteins E)', '0 (Cholesterol Esters)', '0 (Lipoproteins, LDL)', '0 (Receptors, LDL)', '97C5T2UQ7J (Cholesterol)']",,,,"['HL-14197/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-35297/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-43815/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Cells from individual leukemic colonies in the spleen of the irradiated mice, and cells from colonies in methylcellulose (MC) culture in vitro, derived from one of these leukemias, MK-8057, were injected into mice; both types of cells caused the deaths of the recipient mice by inducing the same type of leukemia. MK-8057 can be maintained in Dexter-type liquid culture with a feeder layer of irradiated bone marrow cells. There was a linear reciprocal relationship between the increasing number of MK-8057 cells injected versus the survival of the recipient mice. A reciprocal relationship also was seen between an increasing number of leukemic stem cells, corresponding to the number of MK-8057 cells, and the survival of mice injected with MK-8057. Giant nuclear megakaryocytes developed during the course of colony growth in the spleen as they did in the MC culture. Such megakaryocytes were acetylcholinesterase positive, whereas leukemic cells in the peripheral blood showed no sign of platelet production nor of a positive reaction to acetylcholinesterase. Cells maintained in culture were entirely positive in platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa when anti-human antibody was used. The larger cells in a splenic cell suspension derived from a moribund mouse were separated and enriched by velocity sedimentation using centrifugal elutriation (CE), and then subjected to flow cytometry using propidium iodide staining. Cells with up to 32N-DNA content were detected. After separating MK-8057 by counter-flow CE, the larger cell fraction (mode at 540 microns3) produced more leukemic colonies when injected into irradiated mice than did the small cell fraction (mode at 240 microns3). A higher percent of the larger cell fraction (61.9%) was killed by the addition of tritiated thymidine cytocide than in the smaller cell fraction (14.9%). Thus, the smaller cell fraction is considered to have more leukemic spleen colony-forming units (L-CFU-s) in the resting state.","['Hirabayashi, Y', 'Inoue, T', 'Yoshida, K', 'Sasaki, H', 'Kubo, S', 'Kanisawa, M', 'Seki, M']","['Hirabayashi Y', 'Inoue T', 'Yoshida K', 'Sasaki H', 'Kubo S', 'Kanisawa M', 'Seki M']","['Department of Pathology, Yokohama City University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cell Cloning,International journal of cell cloning,8308172,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Separation/methods', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/etiology/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/*pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Spleen/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*cytology', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/stem.5530090106 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cell Cloning. 1991 Jan;9(1):24-42. doi: 10.1002/stem.5530090106.,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Direct inoculation of L2C lymphoma cells into the cisterna magna of guinea-pigs gives rise to a leptomeningeal pattern of growth, similar to that of human ALL, and to a systemic leukaemia which develops in approximately 14 days. In our model the systemic disease could be controlled with cyclophosphamide while the meningeal disease progressed and provided a target for i.t. immunotoxin. The immunotoxin used consisted of an anti-idiotypic antibody disulphide-bonded to the ribosome-inactivating protein saporin. It was highly cytotoxic to L2C cells in vitro, being around 30,000 times more potent than a control immunotoxin at inhibiting protein synthesis. In vivo, the maximum tolerated dose of i.t. immunotoxin was 10 micrograms. From the rate at which radiolabelled immunotoxins appeared in the plasma following i.t. injection, we were able to estimate that its half-life in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was between 1 1/2 and 2 hr. Intrathecal treatment of guinea-pigs with immunotoxin 1 day after inoculation of L2C cells into the cisterna magna had a remarkable therapeutic effect. All guinea-pigs treated with 0.5 or 5 micrograms of immunotoxin survived, and remained tumour-free for more than 100 days after treatment, while control animals given cyclophosphamide alone or an irrelevant immunotoxin had a mean survival time of 28 days. Provided concerns over toxicity can be overcome, these results indicate that i.t. immunotoxins offer an alternative, highly specific form of treatment in leptomeningeal neoplasia.","['Urch, C E', 'George, A J', 'Stevenson, G T', 'Bolognesi, A', 'Stirpe, F', 'Weller, R', 'Glennie, M J']","['Urch CE', 'George AJ', 'Stevenson GT', 'Bolognesi A', 'Stirpe F', 'Weller R', 'Glennie MJ']","['Lymphoma Research Unit, Southampton General Hospital, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/administration & dosage/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Guinea Pigs', 'Immunotoxins/administration & dosage/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Injections, Spinal', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Lymphoma/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Meningeal Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology', '*N-Glycosyl Hydrolases', 'Plant Proteins/administration & dosage/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Ribosome Inactivating Proteins, Type 1', 'Saporins']",1991/04/01 00:00,1991/04/01 00:01,['1991/04/01 00:00'],"['1991/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.2910470621 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1991 Apr 1;47(6):909-15. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910470621.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Immunotoxins)', '0 (Plant Proteins)', '0 (Ribosome Inactivating Proteins, Type 1)', 'EC 3.2.2.- (N-Glycosyl Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.2.2.22 (Saporins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In each case, the incidence (or mortality) has been higher in the urban areas in each sex, the ratios varying from a minimum of 1.03 to 1 in men in Japan to 1.63 to 1 in men in Denmark. Examination of 26 separate types of cancer showed that 23 tended to be more common in towns, 1 (myeloma) to be evenly distributed, and 2 (cancers of the lip and eye) to be more common in the countryside. The urban excess was greatest for cancers of the bladder, larynx, liver, lung, mouth and pharynx, and oesophagus, and least for leukaemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. It is concluded that differences in personal behaviour (cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption, sexual promiscuity, exposure to ultraviolet light, type of diet, and family size) are the principal factors responsible for the urban excess. Other factors include general atmospheric pollution, occupational hazards, genetic differences in susceptibility, and artefacts of diagnosis and recording. The rural excess was marked for cancer of the lip in both sexes, but less marked and clearly evident only in men for cancer of the eye. Three-quarters of eye cancers are melanomas and the excess incidence in rural areas provides some weak support for the idea that exposure to sunlight contributes to the production of the disease.","['Doll, R']",['Doll R'],"['Imperial Cancer Research Fund, Radcliffe Infirmary, Oxford, UK.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,IM,"['Denmark', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Japan', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/epidemiology/*etiology/mortality', '*Rural Population', 'Sex Characteristics', 'United States', '*Urban Population']",1991/04/01 00:00,1991/04/01 00:01,['1991/04/01 00:00'],"['1991/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.2910470602 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1991 Apr 1;47(6):803-10. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910470602.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To elucidate the regulation of T18d, different restriction fragments of the 5' flanking region between -457 and +146 were linked to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene and transfected into TL+ and TL- cells. By comparison of transiently expressed CAT activity among cells transfected with different CAT constructs, the results suggest that determination of TL+ vs TL- phenotypes is located within the region -105 to -33, and that an element essential to T18d expression resides within the region -33 to +54. Putative DNA-binding factors characterizing particular cell types and displaying selective affinity for particular T18d restriction fragments were identified by electrophoretic mobility shift assays with nuclear extracts (NEs). Two factors (or complexes) which bound specifically to the T18d fragment -105 to -33 were expressed preferentially in TL+ cells and thus may be involved in determining the tissue-selective expression of T18d. The close proximity of negative and positive cis-acting elements within the promoter region is consistent with regulation of T18d gene expression by a variety of trans-acting factors whose production is attuned to development and differentiation. The data provided may serve as a guide to study the regulation of other categories of Tla genes that are normally silent in thymocytes but may become expressed by leukemia cells.","['Horie, M', 'Matsuura, A', 'Chang, K J', 'Niikawa, J', 'Shen, F W']","['Horie M', 'Matsuura A', 'Chang KJ', 'Niikawa J', 'Shen FW']","['Laboratory of Mammalian Immunogenetics, Tampa Bay Research Institute, Saint Petersburg, FL 33716.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Immunogenetics,Immunogenetics,0420404,IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase/analysis/genetics', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'DNA/metabolism', 'Gene Expression', '*Genes, MHC Class I', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic']",1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF01719236 [doi]'],ppublish,Immunogenetics. 1991;33(3):171-7. doi: 10.1007/BF01719236.,"['0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (Tla antigens)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.3.1.28 (Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase)']",,['t18d'],,['CA47054/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Cell fusions were performed either by exposing a suspension of mixed cells to an electric pulse or by the polyethylene glycol method. To identify the origin of the nuclei in a heterokaryon, one set of partner cells was prelabeled with [3H]thymidine before fusion. DNA synthetic activity after fusion was then revealed immunohistochemically by bromodeoxyuridine incorporation. DNA synthesis in the nuclei of 3T3 was inhibited in the heterokaryons of 3T3 and in either one of the two differentiated forms of HL60, i.e., the macrophage-like or the granulocyte-like. The result supports that a negative regulator of DNA synthesis exists in the differentiated HL60. Surprisingly, we have also found that DNA synthesis was inhibited in the nuclei of both 3T3 and nondifferentiated, proliferating HL60 when these two cells were fused. When unfused, proliferating cells were eliminated with cytosine arabinoside; these nonreplicating heterokaryons survived for at least 5 days, and 15% of them showed alpha-naphthylacetate esterase activity, a trait of the macrophage differentiation.

The results indicate that the pentamidine ligands in Pt-pentamidine probably have an interaction with the DNA stronger than that of pentamidine alone because they are bound to the nucleic acid through the cis-PtCl2 residues. However, the cis-PtCl2 residues do not seem to significantly destabilize the helix. Two types of evidences are consistent with this hypothesis: (1) a decrease in the dielectric constant of the medium does not remove the pentamidine ligands from the Pt-pentamidine: DNA complex, and (2) the renaturation of the DNA in Pt-pentamidine:DNA complex is DNA concentration independent. 1H- and 13C-NMR spectroscopic data together with the elemental analysis indicate that the complex is a stoichiometric oligomer of formula [(cis-PtCl2)3(pentamidine)3] [PtCl4]2.

At a concentration of 50 mg/kg, about 15% of the LD50 for the 1,5 and 9 days schedule, the antitumor activity (T/C = 337%) is considerably superior to that of cis-DDP (T/C = 215%) or carboplatin (T/C = 220%) at doses representing 75% and 50%, respectively, of the LD50 for the same treatment schedule. Moreover, it was found that the nephro-hepatotoxicity of the complex is low.","['Perez, J M', 'Navarro-Ranninger, M C', 'Requena, J M', 'Jimenez-Ruiz, A', 'Parrondo, E', 'Craciunescu, D', 'Lopez, M C', 'Alonso, C']","['Perez JM', 'Navarro-Ranninger MC', 'Requena JM', 'Jimenez-Ruiz A', 'Parrondo E', 'Craciunescu D', 'Lopez MC', 'Alonso C']","['Centro de Biologia Molecular, Universidad Autonoma de Madrid, Facultad de Ciencias, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Ireland,Chem Biol Interact,Chemico-biological interactions,0227276,IM,"['Animals', 'Carboplatin/therapeutic use', 'Cisplatin/therapeutic use/toxicity', 'DNA/*metabolism', 'Drug Stability', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L1210/*drug therapy', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Mice', 'Molecular Structure', 'Nucleic Acid Denaturation', 'Organoplatinum Compounds/*metabolism/therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Pentamidine/*analogs & derivatives/chemistry/metabolism/therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Single-Strand Specific DNA and RNA Endonucleases/metabolism', 'Thermodynamics']",1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0009-2797(91)90042-6 [pii]', '10.1016/0009-2797(91)90042-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Chem Biol Interact. 1991;77(3):341-55. doi: 10.1016/0009-2797(91)90042-6.,"['0 (Organoplatinum Compounds)', '101299-67-6 (platinum(II) pentamidine)', '673LC5J4LQ (Pentamidine)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'BG3F62OND5 (Carboplatin)', 'EC 3.1.30.1 (Single-Strand Specific DNA and RNA Endonucleases)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A minimum of 10(3) PL thymic cells are required to induce lymphomas in the recipient. Most of the individual lymphomas developed in mice which were inoculated with cells of a single PL thymus, derived from different T-cell precursors. PL thymic cells could be grown in vitro on a feeder layer consisting of splenic stromal cells. Growth medium was supplemented with supernatant harvested from an established radiation leukemia virus-induced lymphoma cell line (SR4). The in vitro-grown PL cells were characterized as Thy-1+, CD4+, CD8- T-cells, most of which expressed radiation leukemia virus antigens. Cultured PL cells were found to be nontumorigenic, based on their inability to form s.c. tumors. However, these cells could develop into thymic lymphomas if inoculated i.t. into syngeneic recipients. A culture of PL cells, maintained for 2 mo, showed clonal T-cell receptor arrangement. Lymphomas which developed in several recipient mice upon injection with these PL cells were found to possess the same T-cell receptor arrangement. These results indicate that PL cells can be adapted for in vitro growth while maintaining their preleukemic character.","['Yefenof, E', 'Epszteyn, S', 'Kotler, M']","['Yefenof E', 'Epszteyn S', 'Kotler M']","['Lautenberg Center for General and Tumor Immunology, Hebrew University-Hadassah Medical School, Jerusalem, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Count', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/microbiology/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/microbiology/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Preleukemia/microbiology/*pathology', 'Retroviridae']",1991/04/15 00:00,1991/04/15 00:01,['1991/04/15 00:00'],"['1991/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/04/15 00:01 [medline]', '1991/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1991 Apr 15;51(8):2179-84.,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The observation that malignant cells commonly become resistant to therapy, while normal cells rarely do, suggests that certain molecular processes involved in malignancy, e.g., oncogene activation, might also play a role in drug resistance. Since aberrant expression and amplification of various myc oncogenes have been implicated in the prognosis of human cancers, the poor therapeutic response of some of these tumors might be explained if high levels of myc gene products rendered cells more refractory to therapy. We tested this hypothesis by determining the effect of varying the level of c-myc expression on resistance to cis-platinum and ionizing radiation in Friend murine erythroleukemia cells expressing varying levels of c-myc gene product. We found that a) the degree of cis-platinum resistance correlated directly with the level of c-myc expression, b) glucocorticoid induction of murine mammary tumor virus promoter-driven c-myc sequences significantly increased cis-platinum resistance, c) restoring c-myc transcript levels to normal restored the original cis-platinum sensitivity at a rate which paralleled that of induced c-myc transcript depletion, and d) c-myc transcript level had no effect on ionizing radiation response. These findings suggest that c-myc levels may influence therapeutic success in some tumors and may regulate specific processes by which cells cope with DNA damage caused by DNA cross-linking agents such as the platinum analogues, but not ionizing radiation.","['Sklar, M D', 'Prochownik, E V']","['Sklar MD', 'Prochownik EV']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor 48109.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Cell Cycle', 'Cell Line', 'Cisplatin/*metabolism', 'Drug Resistance/genetics', '*Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Gene Amplification', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Genes, myc/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*genetics/metabolism', 'Transfection/genetics']",1991/04/15 00:00,1991/04/15 00:01,['1991/04/15 00:00'],"['1991/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/04/15 00:01 [medline]', '1991/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1991 Apr 15;51(8):2118-23.,['Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)'],,,,['R01HL33741/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The model fits all the available experimental data tested. Furthermore, it shows how the CML cells can ultimately outnumber the normal cells and how this process can be very slow. The model provides a quantitative approach to the relationship between proliferation and maturation and resolves the apparent contradiction between decreased proliferation and increased production, by assuming that a greater fraction of CML cells is produced by division rather than by maturation. The model should be helpful in designing experiments to better define the abnormalities of proliferation and maturation in CML and in seeking to define the specific alterations in the cell regulatory networks resulting from the production of the chimeric p210bcr-abl protein characteristic of CML.","['Fokas, A S', 'Keller, J B', 'Clarkson, B D']","['Fokas AS', 'Keller JB', 'Clarkson BD']","['Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, Clarkson University, Potsdam, New York 13699-5815.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Granulocytes/*cytology', 'Hematopoiesis/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*blood', '*Models, Biological', '*Models, Theoretical', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/physiology', 'Stem Cells/physiology']",1991/04/15 00:00,1991/04/15 00:01,['1991/04/15 00:00'],"['1991/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/04/15 00:01 [medline]', '1991/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1991 Apr 15;51(8):2084-91.,,,,,['CA20194/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,

We have recently shown that the GVL effect of bone marrow transplantation (BMT) with interleukin 2 (IL-2)-activated bone marrow (ABM) followed by IL-2 therapy immediately after BMT is superior to the GVL effect of BMT with fresh, syngeneic bone marrow, with or without IL-2 therapy, in mice with acute myeloid leukemia. The present studies show that institution of IL-2 treatment 1, 2, or 3 weeks after BMT with ABM resulted in shortening of survival and fall in cure rate as compared to IL-2 therapy instituted immediately after BMT with ABM. Increasing the dose of IL-2 did not improve results. However, reducing the frequency of IL-2 administration to once a day instead of twice a day affected the results adversely. Commencing IL-2 therapy 1, 2, or 3 weeks after BMT with fresh, syngeneic bone marrow did not improve the GVL effect as compared to IL-2 therapy started immediately after BMT with fresh, syngeneic bone marrow. Cryopreserved bone marrow was effectively activated with IL-2 and used successfully for BMT after thawing. The animals cured of leukemia by BMT with ABM and and IL-2 therapy were not resistant to leukemia and died when reinfused with leukemic cells. Our findings suggest that for optimum GVL effect, activation of bone marrow is necessary and IL-2 therapy should be started immediately after BMT with ABM.","['Charak, B S', 'Brynes, R K', 'Katsuda, S', 'Groshen, S', 'Chen, S C', 'Mazumder, A']","['Charak BS', 'Brynes RK', 'Katsuda S', 'Groshen S', 'Chen SC', 'Mazumder A']","['Department of Medicine, University of Southern California School of Medicine, Los Angeles 90033.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cryopreservation', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Interleukin-2/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/mortality/prevention & control/*therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL']",1991/04/15 00:00,1991/04/15 00:01,['1991/04/15 00:00'],"['1991/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/04/15 00:01 [medline]', '1991/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1991 Apr 15;51(8):2015-20.,['0 (Interleukin-2)'],,,,"['CA01222/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA14089/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA42962/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Tumor models used included murine leukemia lines selected in vivo for acquired resistance to various antitumor drugs and the human mammary and lung tumor xenografts MX-1 and H82, respectively. The therapeutic effects of p.o. penclomedine against s.c. MX-1 and H82 xenografts were shown to be independent of treatment schedule. Therapeutic activity was comparable when p.o. and parenteral treatments were compared. Lines of P388 leukemia resistant to melphalan, cyclophosphamide, and carmustine were cross-resistant to penclomedine in vivo. Leukemia lines resistant to antimetabolites, DNA binders/intercalators, and vincristine were not cross-resistant to penclomedine. Intracerebrally implanted MX-1 xenografts retained their sensitivity to p.o. penclomedine, and therapeutic activity was at least comparable to that of carmustine, a drug known for its ability to cross the blood-brain barrier.

The distribution of the SCE frequency within chromosome groups also remained similar in all cases. Because the SCE assay has proven a very sensitive tool for detection of resistance to chemotherapy with alkylating agents, we conclude that the clonal evolution of CML blast crisis is not associated with a significant degree of chemotherapy resistance.

The Northern Regional Bone Marrow Transplant Group.,1593-8,"We report the safety and efficacy of 34 consecutive autologous bone marrow transplant (ABMT) procedures performed in adult patients with high-grade lymphoid malignancy after remission induction therapy. Fifteen patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and six with high-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) received pretransplant conditioning with intravenous (IV) melphalan and fractionated total body irradiation (TBI). Thirteen other patients with NHL were conditioned with melphalan alone, having previously received local involved field radiotherapy. Unmanipulated noncryopreserved autologous marrow was reinfused within 48 hours of harvesting. Engraftment occurred in all patients with medians of 10 days of neutropenia (neutrophils less than 0.5 x 10(9)/L), 4-day platelet transfusion requirement, 3 U packed RBC transfusion, and 18 days in hospital posttransplant. There were no procedure-related deaths. Actuarial disease-free survival in the 13 patients with ALL receiving autotransplant early in first remission is 48% with a median follow-up of 3 years. Two other ALL patients who had autotransplants after a period of maintenance therapy also remain in complete remission (CR). These results compare favorably with our 34% disease-free survival (DFS) in 15 allogeneic ALL transplant patients and 21% DFS in 19 patients on standard maintenance after a common induction schedule. No relapses have occurred in the 17 NHL patients transplanted in remission (median follow-up 2 years), but the two NHL patients who developed recurrent disease before ABMT died of progressive disease after temporary responses. We conclude that this method of ABMT results in rapid reengraftment with lack of toxicity and that the conditioning treatment used shows good efficacy against disease. It is applicable in high-grade lymphoid malignancy in first remission, and our results call into question the need for marrow purging in ALL and NHL patients transplanted in first remission.","['Carey, P J', 'Proctor, S J', 'Taylor, P', 'Hamilton, P J']","['Carey PJ', 'Proctor SJ', 'Taylor P', 'Hamilton PJ']","['University Department of Haematology, Royal Victoria Infirmary, Newcastle upon Tyne, England.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cryopreservation', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/drug therapy/radiotherapy/*surgery', 'Male', 'Melphalan/*administration & dosage', 'Mercaptopurine/administration & dosage', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/radiotherapy/*surgery', 'Remission Induction', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",1991/04/01 00:00,1991/04/01 00:01,['1991/04/01 00:00'],"['1991/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)83301-1 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1991 Apr 1;77(7):1593-8.,"['E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'Q41OR9510P (Melphalan)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One case with a bcl-2 rearrangement showed comigration of the bcl-2 major breakpoint region and a rearranged JH band. This indicates a t(14;18) (q32;q21).

We have identified p53 protein variants with abnormal mobility on gel electrophoresis and/or prolonged half-life (t 1/2). We have sequenced the p53 coding sequence from primary blast cells of five AML patients and from the AML cell line (OCIM2). In OCIM2, a point mutation in codon 274 was identified that changes a valine residue to aspartic acid. A wild type p53 allele was not detected in these cells. Two point mutations (codon 135, cysteine to serine; codon 246, methionine to valine) were identified in cDNA from blasts of one AML patient. Both mutations were present in blast colonies grown from single blast progenitor cells, indicating that individual leukemia cells had sustained mutation of both p53 alleles. The cDNAs sequenced from blast samples of four other patients, including one with prolonged p53 protein t 1/2 and one with no detectable p53 protein, were fully wild type. Thus, the heterogeneity of p53 expression cannot be explained in all cases by genetic change in the p53 coding sequence. The prolonged t 1/2 of p53 protein seen in some AML blasts may therefore reflect changes not inherent to p53. A model is proposed in which mutational inactivation of p53, although not required for the evolution of neoplasia, would confer a selective advantage, favoring clonal outgrowth during disease progression.","['Slingerland, J M', 'Minden, M D', 'Benchimol, S']","['Slingerland JM', 'Minden MD', 'Benchimol S']","['Ontario Cancer Institute, Toronto, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Blast Crisis/genetics', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Models, Genetic', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Mutation', 'Oligonucleotide Probes', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/biosynthesis/*genetics']",1991/04/01 00:00,1991/04/01 00:01,['1991/04/01 00:00'],"['1991/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)83289-3 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1991 Apr 1;77(7):1500-7.,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Oligonucleotide Probes)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Analysis of various putative prognostic factors for CR and overall and leukemia-free survival showed significance for a previous history of myelodysplasia, higher initial leukocyte counts, certain French-American-British (FAB) types, and certain abnormal karyotypes. None of these factors was consistently significant regarding the above parameters, although small patient numbers in certain analyses may have obscured significant associations. Myelosuppression was occasionally prolonged after remission induction and especially post-CR therapy. Severe cerebellar toxicity was observed in 13 patients; in 11 cases, this toxicity was fully reversible. Other serious complications were infrequent. Intensive chemotherapy with high-dose cytarabine and daunorubicin has substantial antileukemic activity in adult AML, and may represent an improvement over conventional therapy. Relapses were common, however, even in patients who received planned therapy, and substantial toxicity was observed. The optimum use of this regimen in AML remains to be determined.","['Phillips, G L', 'Reece, D E', 'Shepherd, J D', 'Barnett, M J', 'Brown, R A', 'Frei-Lahr, D A', 'Klingemann, H G', 'Bolwell, B J', 'Spinelli, J J', 'Herzig, R H']","['Phillips GL', 'Reece DE', 'Shepherd JD', 'Barnett MJ', 'Brown RA', 'Frei-Lahr DA', 'Klingemann HG', 'Bolwell BJ', 'Spinelli JJ', 'Herzig RH', 'et al.']","['Leukemia/Bone Marrow Transplantation Program of British Columbia, Vancouver General Hospital, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction']",1991/04/01 00:00,1991/04/01 00:01,['1991/04/01 00:00'],"['1991/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)83280-7 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1991 Apr 1;77(7):1429-35.,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All patients received CyA orally thereafter. All patients were prepared with cyclophosphamide (CY) 120 mg/kg and fractionated total body irradiation (TBI), and received unfractionated BM from an HLA-identical sibling. The two groups were comparable for diagnosis, disease status, French-American-British (FAB) classification, WBC count at diagnosis, cytogenetic abnormalities, extramedullary disease before BMT, donor/recipient age and sex, number of cells infused, and number of days with intravenous (IV) CyA.

Necrosis, the first type of cell death to be recognized, is an uncontrolled degenerative phenomenon invariably caused by noxious stimuli and is the result of irreversible failure of membrane function. Apoptosis, on the other hand, is a death process which involves a series of well-organized events which require active cell participation, and is primarily caused by physiological stimuli. In the present study we show that cell death induced by a range of varied agents may take the form of either apoptosis or necrosis. Apoptotic cell death was found to occur at low levels of these agents, while at higher levels necrosis occurred. Hence, cells which are not killed directly, but merely injured by these agents, have the capacity to activate an internally programmed suicide death mechanism, whereas cells receiving greater injuries apparently do not. In addition, the presence of extracellular calcium was found to be necessary for the induction of apoptosis with all agents tested.","['Lennon, S V', 'Martin, S J', 'Cotter, T G']","['Lennon SV', 'Martin SJ', 'Cotter TG']","[""Department of Biology, St. Patrick's College, Maynooth, Co.

Sixty-nine percent of these patients had portal hypertension, representing 27% of all our patients with portal hypertension and a non-cirrhotic liver. Nodular regenerative hyperplasia was the second most frequent cause of portal hypertension in patients without cirrhosis. To make the diagnosis, a reticulin staining of a surgical biopsy is most helpful. However, the characteristic derangement of the liver architecture on histology may still be overlooked. In this study a suggestive relation was found between malignant disease (multiple myeloma, chronic myelogenous leukaemia, Leydig cell tumour and Hodgkin's disease), the use of cytotoxic or immunosuppressive drugs and nodular regenerative hyperplasia. Furthermore, a high rate of symptomatic nodular regenerative hyperplasia was observed in patients following kidney transplantation. Liver function abnormalities developed in these patients after a period ranging from 8 months to 3 years of immunosuppressive- or chemotherapy. These liver function abnormalities were, however, usually mild. Since hepatic encephalopathy is not likely to develop in these patients with nodular regenerative hyperplasia a decompressive shunt operation is a good alternative approach, if not the treatment of choice, for the prevention of recurrent variceal haemorrhage.","['Naber, A H', 'Van Haelst, U', 'Yap, S H']","['Naber AH', 'Van Haelst U', 'Yap SH']","['Department of Medicine, University Hospital of Nijmegen, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,J Hepatol,Journal of hepatology,8503886,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects', 'Biopsy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hyperplasia/complications/diagnosis/pathology', 'Hypertension, Portal/diagnosis/*etiology/pathology', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/adverse effects', 'Liver/drug effects/pathology', 'Liver Diseases/*complications/diagnosis/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0168-8278(91)90916-Y [pii]', '10.1016/0168-8278(91)90916-y [doi]']",ppublish,J Hepatol. 1991 Jan;12(1):94-9. doi: 10.1016/0168-8278(91)90916-y.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In medium containing 10 microM dipyridamole and 20 microM adenosine, the equilibrative nucleoside transport systems of L1210/AM cells were substantially inhibited and the unimpaired activity of the Na(+)-dependent nucleoside transport system resulted in the cellular accumulation of free adenosine to 86 microM in 5 min, a concentration three times greater than the steady-state levels of adenosine achieved without dipyridamole. Uphill adenosine transport was not observed when extracellular Na+ was replaced by Li+, K+, Cs+, or N-methyl-D-glucammonium ions, or after treatment of the cells with nystatin, a Na+ ionophore. These findings show that concentrative nucleoside transport activity in L1210/AM cells required an inward transmembrane Na+ gradient. Treatment of cells in sodium medium with 2 mM furosemide in the absence or presence of 2 mM ouabain inhibited Na(+)-dependent adenosine transport by 50 and 75%, respectively. However, because treatment of cells with either agent in Na(+)-free medium decreased adenosine transport by only 25%, part of this inhibition may be secondary to the effects of furosemide and ouabain on the ionic content of the cells.

CCRF-CEM R30dm (R30dm), cloned from CCRF-CEM R30/6 (a MTX-resistant subline of the CCRF-CEM human leukemia cell line), had growth characteristics similar to CCRF-CEM. R30dm was resistant to a 24-h exposure to levels as high as 300 microM MTX but was as sensitive as CCRF-CEM to continuous MTX exposure. MTX resistance of R30dm was stable for greater than 68 weeks in the absence of selective pressure. Initial velocities of MTX transport were comparable for R30dm and CCRF-CEM, as were dihydrofolate reductase specific activity and MTX binding. A 2-fold thymidylate synthase activity decrease for R30dm from that of CCRF-CEM was not a significant factor in R30dm MTX resistance. Decreased MTX poly(gamma-glutamate) synthesis resulted in lower levels of drug accumulation by R30dm. Decreased polyglutamylation was attributable to folylpolyglutamate synthetase (FPGS) activity in R30dm extracts which was 1, 2, and less than or equal to 10% of CCRF-CEM extracts with the substrates MTX, aminopterin, and naturally occurring folates, respectively. Comparison of cell lines with varying levels of resistance to short term MTX exposure indicated that the extent of MTX resistance was proportional to the reduction of FPGS activity.

To test whether an increased putrescine content confers a growth advantage at lower osmolarities, we compared the ability of L1210 mouse leukemia cells and of ODC-overproducing variants obtained from this cell line (D-R cells) to proliferate after a hypotonic shock (325----130 mosmol/kg). The growth rate of D-R cells at 130 mosmol/kg was greater than or equal to 5-fold higher than in L1210 cells; and unlike the ODC-overproducing strain, L1210 cells underwent up to a 90% loss of viability over time as seen after restoration of normosmotic growth conditions and by trypan blue exclusion tests. The addition of putrescine or L-ornithine stimulated the proliferation of both cell sublines up to 5-fold in a concentration-dependent manner, with a maximal effect observed at about 10 and 100 microM, respectively. Putrescine restored virtually normal growth rates in both sublines at osmolarities as low as 190 mosmol/kg. No other alpha,omega-diamine was active in that respect whereas spermidine was markedly inhibitory. Furthermore, D-R cells incubated at 130 mosmol/kg showed a marked growth inhibition by 1-aminooxy-3-aminopropane (potent ODC inhibitor to which they are resistant in isotonic media) as a result of putrescine but not spermidine depletion. Whereas ODC was strongly and rapidly induced by hypotonic shock there was a precipitous decline in S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase activity. Putrescine synthesis and accumulation were nevertheless reduced in D-R cells incubated at 130 mosmol/kg because of a decreased availability of L-ornithine. When either putrescine or L-ornithine was added to hypotonic media, D-R cells accumulated putrescine massively for extended periods together with a reduction in spermidine and spermine contents. Putrescine transport patterns were altered by hypotonic shock, net excretion of the diamine being reduced by about 80%, with a concurrent enlargement of the intracellular pool. Finally, parental L1210 cells incubated with an irreversible inhibitor of S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase for 24 h until hypotonic shock and supplemented with putrescine in the presence of the drug thereafter exhibited a greatly exaggerated growth stimulation by the diamine.

This complex is composed of products of the jun and fos gene families. The present studies have examined the effects of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) on the regulation of jun-B gene expression during induction of monocytic differentiation. Low levels of jun-B transcripts were present in uninduced HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cells. In contrast, treatment with TPA was associated with rapid increases in jun-B mRNA levels that were maximal at 3 h and remained elevated at 48 h. The induction of jun-B expression by TPA in these cells preceded that of the c-jun and c-fos genes. Similar increases in jun-B transcripts were detectable in TPA-treated THP-1 and U-937 myeloid leukemia cells, although expression of this gene was transient in the more differentiated THP-1 cells. Run-on assays demonstrated low levels of jun-B gene activation in untreated HL-60 cells, whereas TPA treatment was associated with a 6-fold increase in the transcription rate of this gene. This induction of jun-B expression occurred in the absence of de novo protein synthesis. In contrast, inhibition of protein synthesis was associated with superinduction of TPA-induced jun-B mRNA levels and an increase in stability of this transcript. These findings suggest that jun-B gene expression is regulated at both the transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels during induction of monocytic differentiation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Datta, R', 'Sherman, M L', 'Stone, R M', 'Kufe, D']","['Datta R', 'Sherman ML', 'Stone RM', 'Kufe D']","['Laboratory of Clinical Pharmacology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cell Growth Differ,Cell growth & differentiation : the molecular biology journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9100024,IM,"['Bryostatins', 'Calcitriol/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Gene Expression/physiology', 'Humans', 'Lactones/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics', 'Macrolides', 'Monocytes/cytology/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun', 'Proto-Oncogenes/*genetics', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects']",1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cell Growth Differ. 1991 Jan;2(1):43-9.,"['0 (Bryostatins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Lactones)', '0 (Macrolides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun)', '37O2X55Y9E (bryostatin 1)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,['jun-B'],,"['CA01902/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA42802/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

The elevated risks of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma were particularly associated with residing near stone, clay, or glass industry facilities.

To analyze the relative Myb dependence of normal and leukemic human hematopoietic progenitor cells, normal bone marrow cells, several types of leukemic blast cells, and 1:1 mixtures of normal and leukemic cells were cultured in the presence of c-myb sense or antisense oligodeoxynucleotides; cell viability and cloning efficiency were then assessed. c-myb sense oligomers had negligible effects on normal and leukemic cells. In contrast, c-myb antisense oligomers strongly inhibited or completely abolished clonogenic growth of a T-cell leukemia line, 78% (18 of 23) of primary acute myelogenous leukemia cases examined, and 4 of 5 primary chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) cases in blast crisis. In three of the latter patients, polymerase chain reaction analysis of a 1:1 mixture of c-myb antisense-treated normal and CML cells revealed a complete absence of bcr-abl expression, suggesting that the CML clonogenic units had been completely eliminated from the cultures. At antisense doses that inhibited leukemic cell growth, normal hematopoietic progenitor cells survived. Thus, normal and leukemic hematopoietic cells show differential sensitivity to the toxic effects of c-myb antisense DNA.

This is a multistep process. Early events observed in infected mice include generalized hematopoietic hyperplasia in the spleen and appearance of mink cell focus-inducing (MCF) recombinants; end-stage tumors are characterized by insertional proviral activation of protooncogenes. We previously showed that an Mo-MuLV enhancer variant, Mo+PyF101 Mo-MuLV, has greatly reduced leukemogenicity and is deficient in induction of preleukemic hyperplasia. In this report, we have examined Mo+PyF101 Mo-MuLV-inoculated mice for the presence of MCF recombinants. In contrast to wild-type Mo-MuLV-inoculated mice, Mo+PyF101 Mo-MuLV-inoculated mice did not generate detectable MCF recombinants. This failure was at least partly due to an inability of the MCF virus to propagate in vivo, since a molecularly cloned infectious Mo+PyF101 MCF virus did not replicate, even when inoculated as a Mo+PyF101 Mo-MuLV pseudotype. These results show that the leukemogenic defect of Mo+PyF101 Mo-MuLV is associated with its inability to generate MCF recombinants capable of replication in vivo. This, in turn, is consistent with the view that MCF recombinants play a significant role in Mo-MuLV-induced disease and, in particular, may play a role early in the disease process.","['Brightman, B K', 'Rein, A', 'Trepp, D J', 'Fan, H']","['Brightman BK', 'Rein A', 'Trepp DJ', 'Fan H']","['Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, University of California, Irvine 92717.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Defective Viruses/*genetics', '*Enhancer Elements, Genetic', '*Genetic Variation', 'L Cells', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*microbiology', 'Mice', 'Mink Cell Focus-Inducing Viruses/*genetics', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics/pathogenicity', 'Preleukemia/*microbiology', 'Proviruses/genetics']",1991/03/15 00:00,1991/03/15 00:01,['1991/03/15 00:00'],"['1991/03/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/03/15 00:01 [medline]', '1991/03/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.88.6.2264 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1991 Mar 15;88(6):2264-8. doi: 10.1073/pnas.88.6.2264.,,,,,"['N01-CO-74101/CO/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R0I CA32455/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 AI07319/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",PMC51211,,,['Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 1991 Jun 1;88(11):5066'],,,,,,,,

A factor with apparently indistinguishable sequence specificity can be induced in many other cell types, where it is used to regulate inducible gene expression. For example, kappa B-related sequences have been shown to be important for the transcription of a few inducible genes, such as the interleukin 2 receptor alpha-chain gene and the beta-interferon gene. However, these genes are not constitutively active in B lymphocytes, suggesting that other regulatory mechanisms must play a role in determining the patterns of expression. We have investigated the constitutive and inducible transcriptional activity mediated by five kappa B-related sequence elements in two different cell types. We show that in S194 plasma cells the activity of each element correlates well with the relative affinity of B-cell-derived NF-kappa B for that element. This leads to significantly lower transcription enhancement by sites derived from the interleukin 2 receptor or T-cell receptor genes in S194 cells. However, in either EL-4 (T) cells or S194 cells, both lower-affinity sites can be significantly induced by the tax gene product of human T-cell leukemia virus type I, showing that NF-kappa B activity can be modulated even in a B-cell line that constitutively expresses this factor.","['Mauxion, F', 'Jamieson, C', 'Yoshida, M', 'Arai, K', 'Sen, R']","['Mauxion F', 'Jamieson C', 'Yoshida M', 'Arai K', 'Sen R']","['Rosenstiel Research Center, Brandeis University, Waltham, MA 02254-9110.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', '*Genes, pX', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'NF-kappa B/genetics/*metabolism', 'Oligonucleotide Probes', '*Transcription, Genetic']",1991/03/15 00:00,1991/03/15 00:01,['1991/03/15 00:00'],"['1991/03/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/03/15 00:01 [medline]', '1991/03/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.88.6.2141 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1991 Mar 15;88(6):2141-5. doi: 10.1073/pnas.88.6.2141.,"['0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Oligonucleotide Probes)']",,,,['GM 38925-02/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],PMC51185,,,,,,,,,,,

The incidence of leukemia in 313 females and 316 males was 1.6% and 1.2%, respectively. About 3 years ago, we observed a relatively high incidence of leukemia in offspring of a healthy female, no. 1. Among the offspring of this female, observed through 12 successive generations, there were 17 leukemias among 44 females (38.6%) and 21 leukemias among 40 males (52.5%), developing at ages varying from 6 to 11.6 months. The most frequent form of leukemia observed was acute myeloid, with a high count of myeloblasts, promyelocytes, and myelocytes; lymphatic form was relatively rare but was observed occasionally; pronounced anemia was common. In most instances, on autopsy, the pathological picture was that of an enlarged spleen and liver, with the exception of those few animals that developed lymphatic leukemia, with thymic and mesenteric lymphoid tumors. We have no satisfactory explanation for this sudden, unexpected conversion of a part of our Sprague-Dawley rat colony from low-leukemic to high-leukemic inbred line. As a working hypothesis, the possibility of a spontaneous activation of a hypothetical oncogenic virus should be considered.

The murine v-abl oncogene product has lost the SH3 domain as a consequence of N-terminal fusion of gag sequences. Deletion of the SH3 domain is sufficient to render the murine c-abl proto-oncogene product transforming when myristylated N-terminal membrane localization sequences are also present. In contrast, the human BCR/ABL oncogene of the Philadelphia chromosome translocation has an intact SH3 domain and its product is not myristylated at the N terminus. To analyze the contribution of BCR-encoded sequences to BCR/ABL-mediated transformation, the effects of a series of deletions and substitutions were assessed in fibroblast and hematopoietic-cell transformation assays. BCR first-exon sequences specifically potentiate transformation and tyrosine kinase activation when they are fused to the second exon of otherwise intact c-ABL. This suggests that BCR-encoded sequences specifically interfere with negative regulation of the ABL-encoded tyrosine kinase, which would represent a novel mechanism for the activation of nonreceptor tyrosine kinase-encoding proto-oncogenes.","['Muller, A J', 'Young, J C', 'Pendergast, A M', 'Pondel, M', 'Landau, N R', 'Littman, D R', 'Witte, O N']","['Muller AJ', 'Young JC', 'Pendergast AM', 'Pondel M', 'Landau NR', 'Littman DR', 'Witte ON']","['Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, University of California, Los Angeles 90024.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', '*Exons', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics/metabolism', 'Genes, abl', 'Genes, gag', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Oncogenes', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Rats']",1991/04/01 00:00,1991/04/01 00:01,['1991/04/01 00:00'],"['1991/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/mcb.11.4.1785-1792.1991 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1991 Apr;11(4):1785-92. doi: 10.1128/mcb.11.4.1785-1792.1991.,"['0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,['BCR/ABL'],,"['GM07185/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA09056/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC359845,,,,,,,,,,,

The intent of this paper is to dispute that attribution, and to suggest that confirmation of such an alarming and prejudicial conclusion should precede its dissemination. MATERIAL CONSIDERED: Critical comment is limited to the paper by the Gardner group presenting their results, the accompanying paper outlining their methods, a review from Mathews that provides some support for the Gardner proposal by suggesting a pathogenetic mechanism, and some observations on inherited tumours by Nomura that are quoted by Gardner et al. and Mathews in support of their beliefs. Other material quoted is from the general medical literature of the past 20 years relating to radiation biology, mutagenesis and carcinogenesis with some relevance to the Gardner contention; it is not exhaustive. MAIN RESULTS: Statistical arguments suggest that it is almost impossible to be sure that a specific leukaemia ""cluster"", such as that near Sellafield, is not a chance finding. The study by Gardner et al. provides only weak statistical evidence for an association between leukaemia in children and parental occupational radiation exposure at Sellafield. The postulate of a causal relation between parental exposure at Sellafield and leukaemia in progeny is incompatible with what is known of the role of genetic mechanisms in leukaemia, with current views on the quantitative relation between radiation dose and mutagenetic effect, and with observations on the children of people exposed to radiation by the nuclear bombs used in Japan in 1945. CONCLUSIONS: The suggestion that occupational exposure to ionising radiation of a father may be responsible for an increased risk of leukaemia in his children cannot be substantiated. It would be proper to seek confirmation from other groups of occupationally exposed persons before undertaking precipitous, and inevitably disturbing, action to remedy the supposed problem.","['Watson, G M']",['Watson GM'],,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Australia,Med J Aust,The Medical journal of Australia,0400714,IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Child', '*Fathers', 'Humans', 'Japan/epidemiology', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology/genetics', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mutation/genetics', '*Nuclear Reactors', '*Occupational Exposure', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*epidemiology/genetics', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Risk Factors', 'Space-Time Clustering', 'United Kingdom/epidemiology']",1991/04/01 00:00,1991/04/01 00:01,['1991/04/01 00:00'],"['1991/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.5694/j.1326-5377.1991.tb121186.x [doi]'],ppublish,Med J Aust. 1991 Apr 1;154(7):483-7. doi: 10.5694/j.1326-5377.1991.tb121186.x.,,23,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: A retrospective epidemiological study of the incidence of cancer in children, aged 0-12 years, in Queensland during the 16-year period 1973-1988 inclusive. SETTING: Cases were found from the records of the Queensland Childhood Malignancy Registry. Ascertainment is believed to be virtually complete for children aged 0-12 years. PARTICIPANTS: All children who were resident in Queensland and less than 13 years of age at the time of diagnosis of cancer. The cases included all malignant neoplasms and also all intracranial neoplasms in children but excluded Langerhans' cell histiocytosis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: The incidence by year of diagnosis was calculated for each of a number of standard diagnostic groups of neoplasms. These data were analysed by the chi 2, for trend test. RESULTS: Cancer incidence was found to be increasing at a rate of about 0.9% per year. The rise was almost entirely accounted for by a rise in incidence among boys, whereas there was virtually no change in the incidence in girls. Statistically significant increases in incidence were found in acute non-lymphocytic leukaemia and also in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in boys; Hodgkin's disease was found to be decreasing in incidence. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study emphasise the importance of childhood cancer incidence surveillance in Australia to determine whether these trends will continue in the future. The findings also indicate a need for continuing research in childhood cancer epidemiology.","['McWhirter, W R', 'Petroeschevsky, A L']","['McWhirter WR', 'Petroeschevsky AL']","[""Department of Child Health, Royal Children's Hospital, Herston, QLD.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Australia,Med J Aust,The Medical journal of Australia,0400714,IM,"['Chi-Square Distribution', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Evaluation Studies as Topic', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/epidemiology', 'Queensland/epidemiology', 'Registries', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Time Factors']",1991/04/01 00:00,1991/04/01 00:01,['1991/04/01 00:00'],"['1991/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.5694/j.1326-5377.1991.tb121174.x [doi]'],ppublish,Med J Aust. 1991 Apr 1;154(7):453-5. doi: 10.5694/j.1326-5377.1991.tb121174.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This finding suggests that DNA repair enzymes may be involved in this process. The activity of 3-methyladenine-DNA glycosylase, which can release altered bases, including adducts at the N-7 position of guanine, was increased significantly in lymphocytes from patients with resistant CLL compared with those from untreated CLL patients. Since glycosylase activity varies with cell proliferation, the amount of [3H]thymidine incorporated into DNA was determined and found to be elevated almost threefold in lymphocytes from patients with resistant CLL. The ratio of glycosylase activity to level of thymidine incorporation did not differ between these two groups of patients. Northern blot analysis of ERCC1 gene (a putative DNA repair enzyme involved in nucleotide excision repair) expression in lymphocytes from patients with CLL revealed multiple gene transcripts (1.1, 3.4, and 3.8 kilobases). In addition, analysis of two samples revealed the presence of a 2.6-kilobase transcript. The 2.6-kilobase transcript was recognized by specific RNA probes that hybridize to antisense ERCC1 transcripts. Levels of expression of the 1.1-kilobase protein encoding transcript in lymphocytes from patients with resistant CLL were increased twofold to threefold above those of untreated patients with CLL. These results indicate that increased expression of ERCC1 and increased activity of 3-methyladenine-DNA glycosylase occur with the development of resistance to the nitrogen mustards in patients with CLL, suggesting a role for enhanced DNA repair in this process.","['Geleziunas, R', 'McQuillan, A', 'Malapetsa, A', 'Hutchinson, M', 'Kopriva, D', 'Wainberg, M A', 'Hiscott, J', 'Bramson, J', 'Panasci, L']","['Geleziunas R', 'McQuillan A', 'Malapetsa A', 'Hutchinson M', 'Kopriva D', 'Wainberg MA', 'Hiscott J', 'Bramson J', 'Panasci L']","['Lady Davis Institute for Medical Research, Sir Mortimer B.

In a review of the literature we identified 18 additional cases of ovarian leukemic relapse. Together, these 23 patients form the basis for this report. Abdominal pain is the most common presenting symptom of ovarian leukemia. An abdominal mass is usually palpable, and at least four patients had hydronephrosis. Nine patients had documented bilateral ovarian involvement; however, bilateral disease was not a poor prognostic sign. Most ovarian relapses occurred more than 36 months after the original diagnosis of ALL, with these ""late'h relapsers responding more favorably to treatment than ""early"" relapsers. Definitive statements can not be made from a retrospective review of 23 case reports; however, salpingooophorectomy had no obvious advantage over simple biopsy, and there was no obvious advantage to the routine use of radiation therapy. Most failures in treating ovarian leukemia occurred within 2 years. Most failures were systemic rather than local, illustrating the need for aggressive multiagent systemic chemotherapy. Survival after ovarian leukemic relapse is possible, with eight of the 23 patients alive and in complete continuous remission following the ovarian relapse (median follow-up since relapse, 42 months; range, 2 to 135+ months). With the use of more intensive chemotherapy in recent protocols, the frequency of ovarian leukemic relapses appears to be decreasing. At this institution, no child with ALL diagnosed in the 1980s has subsequently developed an ovarian relapse.","['Pais, R C', 'Kim, T H', 'Zwiren, G T', 'Ragab, A H']","['Pais RC', 'Kim TH', 'Zwiren GT', 'Ragab AH']","['Department of Pediatrics, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA 30322.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,J Pediatr Surg,Journal of pediatric surgery,0052631,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/drug therapy/*pathology/radiotherapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*pathology/radiotherapy', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies']",1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0022-3468(91)90430-2 [pii]', '10.1016/0022-3468(91)90430-2 [doi]']",ppublish,J Pediatr Surg. 1991 Jan;26(1):70-4. doi: 10.1016/0022-3468(91)90430-2.,,24,,,['CA20549/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,

An analysis of precursor cytotoxic T lymphocyte frequencies in young versus moderately aged mice.,2469-77,"As young adult AKR.H-2b:Fv-1b mice reach about 9 wk of age, they begin to develop a nonresponsiveness to AKR/Gross leukemia virus. Unlike young mice that are responders, moderately aged AKR.H-2b:Fv-1b mice, after immunization and secondary in vitro restimulation in bulk culture with AKR/Gross virus induced tumors, can not generate anti-AKR/Gross virus-specific CTL. The mechanism of conversion to nonresponsiveness in moderately aged AKR.H-2b:Fv-1b mice is not understood, but it is correlated with increased expression of endogenous ecotropic viral antigens. Our present investigation focuses on determining the frequency of anti-AKR/Gross virus precursor CTL in AKR.H-2b:Fv-1b mice as a function of age. This was achieved by performing limiting dilution cultures of immune spleen cells obtained from young and moderately aged AKR.H-2b:Fv-1b mice. Although spleen cells obtained from immune moderately aged mice can not differentiate in bulk cultures into anti-AKR/Gross virus-specific CTL, there was no evidence of substantially decreased frequencies of virus-specific precursor CTL, relative to precursor CTL frequencies observed in young responder AKR.H-2b:Fv-1b mice.","['Wegmann, K W', 'McMaster, J S', 'Green, W R']","['Wegmann KW', 'McMaster JS', 'Green WR']","['Department of Microbiology, Dartmouth Medical School, Hanover, NH 03756.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['AKR murine leukemia virus/*immunology', 'Age Factors', 'Animals', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Immune Tolerance', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred AKR/*immunology', 'Mice, Mutant Strains', 'Poly I-C/pharmacology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology']",1991/04/01 00:00,1991/04/01 00:01,['1991/04/01 00:00'],"['1991/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1991 Apr 1;146(7):2469-77.,['O84C90HH2L (Poly I-C)'],,,,"['CA-23108/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K04 CA-01112/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

We report here that infection of human T lymphocyte lines with a murine leukemia virus results in up-regulation of a number of lymphocyte-specific cell surface Ag. These proteins include CD2, CD3, CD4, the TCR, and MHC class I Ag. The expression of other cell surface proteins, such as LFA-3, are unaffected by the presence of the retrovirus. This up-regulation occurs at the level of the mRNA transcripts encoding these proteins, and is the result of increased transcription of the respective genes. The increases in transcription are the result of a trans-activation process by the leukemia virus. The transient introduction of chimeric genes consisting of MHC class I gene promoter sequences attached to the reporter gene CAT into human T cells containing murine retrovirus produces stimulated transcription of the reporter gene. Subgenomic portions of the murine leukemia virus containing the long terminal repeats and the 5' untranslated region are sufficient to produce transactivation of the same set of T cell genes as the whole leukemia virus. The finding that murine leukemia viruses enhance transcription and expression of a group of T cell surface proteins, all of which have been reported to be capable of transducing an activating signal to the lymphocyte, may be relevant to the pathophysiologic mechanisms whereby these viruses induce leukemias and lymphomas.","['Koka, P', 'van de Mark, K', 'Faller, D V']","['Koka P', 'van de Mark K', 'Faller DV']","['Division of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02115.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Antigens, CD/genetics', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/genetics', 'Blotting, Northern', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA, Viral/genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Genetic Vectors', 'HLA-D Antigens/genetics', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/genetics', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/genetics', 'Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'T-Lymphocytes/*physiology']",1991/04/01 00:00,1991/04/01 00:01,['1991/04/01 00:00'],"['1991/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1991 Apr 1;146(7):2417-25.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (HLA-D Antigens)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report the results of a genetic linkage study involving 34 families enrolled in the International Fanconi Anemia Registry. A significant lod score was obtained between D20S20, an anonymous DNA segment from chromosome 20q, and Fanconi anemia (Zmax 3.04, theta max = 0.12). However, six other anonymous DNA segments from chromosome 20q, including D20S19, which is highly polymorphic and tightly linked to D20S20, showed no or only weak evidence for linkage to Fanconi anemia. An admixture test revealed significant evidence for linkage heterogeneity (chi 2 = 6.10, P = 0.01) at the D20S19 locus. Lod scores suggestive of linkage between Fanconi anemia and this locus were obtained with two of the largest kindreds studied (lods = 2.6 and 2.1, at theta = 0.001).

In the CEM-C7 cell line (dexamethasone-sensitive), apoptosis was induced not only by dexamethasone but by actinomycin D, cycloheximide, and 25-OH cholesterol. In the CEM-C1 cell line (dexamethasone-resistant) cycloheximide, 25-OH cholesterol, or cell starvation could induce apoptosis.

However, these compounds have equal or greater ability to differentiate leukemia cells and psoriatic fibroblasts and to suppress PTH synthesis and secretion. The mechanism for this selectivity has not been elucidated. Because the lower potency of ergocalciferol compared to cholecalciferol in preventing or curing rickets in chicks was associated with a lower affinity of the avian vitamin D binding protein (DBP) for vitamin D2, we tested five analogs with low calcemic activity including 22-oxa-1,25-(OH)2D3 (OCT), MC903, 1,25-(OH)2-16 ene-23-yne D3, 1,25-(OH)2-26,27 dihomo-22-ene-D3, and 1,25-(OH)2-24-trihomo-22-ene-D3 for their affinity for rat serum DBP. All analogs had a low affinity for DBP, ranging from 50-3000 times less than that of 1,25-(OH)2D3. OCT also bound with low affinity to dog and human serum DBP. We tested with OCT the possible consequences of its low affinity for serum DBP. One of the functions of DBP is to prolong the lifetime of 1,25-(OH)2D3 in circulation. Quantification of the metabolic clearance rate (MCR) of OCT in 8 normal dogs using a single bolus injection technique showed that OCT was cleared at a rate of 48.2 +/- 7.5 ml/min, approximately 6-7 times more rapidly than 1,25-(OH)2D3 (6.8 +/- 0.4 ml/min). The estimated half-life of OCT in the circulation was 2.5 +/- 0.3 h compared to 7.0 +/- 0.6; n = 7 for 1,25-(OH)2D3. As our primary interest is the potential of OCT in treating the secondary hyperparathyroidism of CRF, we also measured the MCR of OCT in 5/6 nephrectomized dogs. Uremia does not affect the rate of clearance of OCT from the circulation (MCR: 56.8 +/- 4.5; t1/2 = 2.1 +/- 0.2 n = 4). Despite its shorter half-life, OCT suppressed PTH secretion in vivo in uremic dogs. The effects of low binding to DBP on the percentage uremic dogs. The effects of low binding to DBP on the percentage of free sterol were determined using an ultrafiltration procedure. We compared the proportion of free (unbound) OCT and 1,25-(OH)2D3 in 0.1% BSA-PBS with concentrations of human serum ranging from 0-25%. The proportion of OCT in the free form was significantly higher than that of 1,25-(OH)2D3 for every serum concentration tested. The physiological relevance of a higher percentage of free OCT was tested in normal human macrophages.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Dusso, A S', 'Negrea, L', 'Gunawardhana, S', 'Lopez-Hilker, S', 'Finch, J', 'Mori, T', 'Nishii, Y', 'Slatopolsky, E', 'Brown, A J']","['Dusso AS', 'Negrea L', 'Gunawardhana S', 'Lopez-Hilker S', 'Finch J', 'Mori T', 'Nishii Y', 'Slatopolsky E', 'Brown AJ']","['Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri 63110.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Endocrinology,Endocrinology,0375040,IM,"['Animals', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Calcitriol/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Calcium/blood', 'Dogs', 'Humans', 'Macrophages/drug effects/metabolism', 'Metabolic Clearance Rate', 'Nephrectomy', 'Parathyroid Hormone/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Uremia/etiology/metabolism', 'Vitamin D-Binding Protein/metabolism']",1991/04/01 00:00,1991/04/01 00:01,['1991/04/01 00:00'],"['1991/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1210/endo-128-4-1687 [doi]'],ppublish,Endocrinology. 1991 Apr;128(4):1687-92. doi: 10.1210/endo-128-4-1687.,"['0 (Parathyroid Hormone)', '0 (Vitamin D-Binding Protein)', '123963-52-0 (1,25-dihydroxy-24-trihomo-22-ene-vitamin D3)', '134508-36-4 (1,25-dihydroxy-26,27-dihomo-22-ene-vitamin D3)', '143NQ3779B (calcipotriene)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)', 'N2UJM5NBF6 (maxacalcitol)', 'O13QTC8612 (Ro 23-7553)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",,,,"['DK-07126/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK-09976/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

All 15 cases could be evaluated by ISH for these 11 probes. Our experiments show that in seven of these randomly selected leukemia bone marrow cell suspensions numerical aberrations for one or two chromosomes could be detected by this method. The results of ISH on interphase nuclei and in some cases on metaphase preparations were compared with karyotyping data. Seven cases of chromosomal aberrations observed with ISH (three for monosomy and four for trisomy) were confirmed by this classical cytogenetic technique, whereas in five instances an aberration was found only with ISH (twice for monosomy, twice for trisomy, and one disomy for the Y-probe). One case of a trisomy for chromosome 1 observed by ISH on interphase nuclei could be explained by a marker chromosome, a finding that was further substantiated by ISH on metaphase spreads. In this case double-target ISH on interphase cells with the probes for chromosomes 1 and 16 strongly suggested a translocation between these chromosomes. Also, in one case a marker chromosome could be characterized as a translocation between chromosomes 7 and 17. In this latter case the cytogenetic examinations revealed only monosomy for chromosomes 7 and 17 in addition to noncharacterized marker chromosomes.

When GM3 was added to cell culture media, the growth of K562 cells was remarkably inhibited and the cells were shown to have megakaryocytoid morphology. Ultrastructural study demonstrated that K562 cells treated with GM3 had platelet peroxidase-positive structures, which were considered to be the specific marker of megakaryocyte. Furthermore, AP-3 directed against an epitope present on membrane glycoprotein IIIa reacted with the GM3-treated cells. Free N-acetylneuraminic acid, GM1, GM2, GD1a, and a mixture of bovine brain gangliosides containing GD1a and GT1b did not affect growth of K562 cells or show morphological changes. According to chemical analyses, GM3 content increased in megakaryocytoid differentiation induced by tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, whereas GM3 decreased in erythroid differentiation induced by hemin. Enzymatic analysis showed that the GM3 increase during megakaryocytoid differentiation was a result of the sialyltransferase activation. These results indicated that exogenous GM3 induced differentiation of K562 cells into a ""GM3-rich"" lineage, i.e., mainly megakaryocytoid lineage, and that GM3 accumulation in the GM3-rich lineage was the result of the activation of GM3 synthase. These findings strongly suggested that GM3 ganglioside, a minor membrane component, has a crucial role in not only the differentiation induction but also the determination of the differentiation direction in pluripotent K562 cells.","['Nakamura, M', 'Kirito, K', 'Yamanoi, J', 'Wainai, T', 'Nojiri, H', 'Saito, M']","['Nakamura M', 'Kirito K', 'Yamanoi J', 'Wainai T', 'Nojiri H', 'Saito M']","['Division of Hemopoiesis, Jichi Medical School, Tochigi, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'G(M3) Ganglioside/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*pathology', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/pathology/ultrastructure']",1991/04/01 00:00,1991/04/01 00:01,['1991/04/01 00:00'],"['1991/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1991 Apr 1;51(7):1940-5.,"['0 (G(M3) Ganglioside)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The ability of IL2 generated activated killer cells to inhibit haemopoietic progenitor cells and to release gamma-interferon (gamma IFN) and tumour necrosis factor (TNF) may, however, retard haemopoietic recovery, as both TNF and gamma IFN inhibit normal myelopoiesis in vitro. To determine the effect of IL2 infusion on myeloid regeneration in vivo, we have examined haemopoietic recovery in patients receiving this cytokine following autologous marrow transplantation or ablative chemotherapy. We find that IL2 infusion accelerates neutrophil recovery and that granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GMCSF) and IL3 mRNA become detectable in circulating mononuclear cells. Induction of TNF by IL2 may also contribute to subsequent acceleration of myelopoiesis by initiation of GM-CSF mRNA synthesis in patient marrow fibroblasts. These results show that IL2 infusion may facilitate myeloid recovery when administered during the period of haemopoietic regeneration following ablative chemoradiotherapy.","['Heslop, H E', 'Duncombe, A S', 'Reittie, J E', 'Bello-Fernandez, C', 'Gottlieb, D J', 'Prentice, H G', 'Mehta, A B', 'Hoffbrand, A V', 'Brenner, M K']","['Heslop HE', 'Duncombe AS', 'Reittie JE', 'Bello-Fernandez C', 'Gottlieb DJ', 'Prentice HG', 'Mehta AB', 'Hoffbrand AV', 'Brenner MK']","['Department of Haematology, Royal Free Hospital, London.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Blood Cell Count', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Female', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/biosynthesis', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors/*blood', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/*therapeutic use', 'Interleukin-3/biosynthesis', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/blood/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/blood/*therapy']",1991/02/01 00:00,1991/02/01 00:01,['1991/02/01 00:00'],"['1991/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1991.tb07983.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1991 Feb;77(2):237-44. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1991.tb07983.x.,"['0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",,,,"['CA-20180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom']",,,,,,,,,,,,

In all three clonogenic assays, rIFN-alpha suppressed colony formation in a dose-dependent manner. No differences were detected in the proliferation of CML or normal Bl-CFC and GM-CFC exposed to rIFN-alpha. Erythroid colony formation by normal, but not by CML BFU-E, was inhibited by relatively low concentrations (100 U/ml) of rIFN-alpha. However, in patients whose blood or marrow contained a mixture of Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-positive and Ph-negative BFU-E, cytogenetic analysis of individual erythroid colonies showed no differential inhibition by rIFN-alpha. We found no difference in the sensitivity to rIFN-alpha of GM-CFC from patients whose leukaemic cells expressed BCR/ABL mRNA with the b2a2 junction and that of GM-CFC from patients with the b3a2 mRNA. We conclude that (1) rIFN-alpha does not have a significant leukaemia-specific effect on the progenitor cells detected in these assays, and (2) the sensitivity of CML GM-CFC to rIFN-alpha is independent of the type of BCR/ABL message present in the cells. The clinical efficacy of rIFN-alpha could be due to selective toxicity to cells not assayed in this study, to effects on accessory cells or to alterations induced in progenitor cell/stromal cell interactions.","['Dowding, C', 'Guo, A P', 'Maisin, D', 'Gordon, M Y', 'Goldman, J M']","['Dowding C', 'Guo AP', 'Maisin D', 'Gordon MY', 'Goldman JM']","['MRC/LRF Leukaemia Unit, Royal Postgraduate Medical School, Hammersmith Hospital, London.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Blotting, Southern', 'Cell Division', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology', 'Humans', 'Interferon alpha-2', 'Interferon-alpha/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/*pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*pathology', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/pathology']",1991/02/01 00:00,1991/02/01 00:01,['1991/02/01 00:00'],"['1991/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1991.tb07972.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1991 Feb;77(2):165-71. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1991.tb07972.x.,"['0 (Interferon alpha-2)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have used a murine model of AIDS, infection of female C57BL/6 mice with LP-BM5 murine leukaemia (MuLV) virus, to determine if AZT-induced anaemia is due, in part, to decreased responsiveness of erythropoietic precursors (BFU-e) to erythropoietin (EPO). Mice in the early stage of LP-BM5 MuLV disease were given AZT in their drinking water at 1.0 and 2.5 mg/ml. AZT produced anaemia in both groups, in a dose-dependent fashion. Despite the anaemia, the number of splenic and bone marrow BFU-e in AZT treated mice increased up to five-fold over levels observed in infected untreated animals after 15 d of treatment. Colony formation by splenic and bone marrow BFUe was stimulated at lower concentrations of EPO in mice receiving AZT for 15 d than for infected, untreated mice. By day 30, sensitivity of both splenic and bone marrow BFU-e of treated animals returned to that observed from cells of infected untreated animals. The mean plasma levels of EPO observed in AZT treated mice were appropriate for the degree of anaemia observed when compared with phenylhydrazine (PHZ) treated mice. The numbers of BFU-e and the percentage of bone marrow erythroblasts observed were comparable in AZT and PHZ treated mice with similar degrees of anaemia. However, reticulocytosis was inappropriate for the degree of anaemia observed in AZT treated infected mice. AZT-induced peripheral anaemia in the face of increased numbers of BFU-e and increased levels of plasma EPO suggest a lesion in terminal differentiation.","['Chow, F P', 'Sutton, P A', 'Hamburger, A W']","['Chow FP', 'Sutton PA', 'Hamburger AW']","['University of Maryland Cancer Center, Baltimore 21201.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Anemia/*chemically induced/pathology', 'Animals', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Erythropoietin/blood/*physiology', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Murine Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/*pathology', 'Spleen/pathology', 'Zidovudine/*toxicity']",1991/02/01 00:00,1991/02/01 00:01,['1991/02/01 00:00'],"['1991/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1991.tb07968.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1991 Feb;77(2):139-44. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1991.tb07968.x.,"['11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', '4B9XT59T7S (Zidovudine)']",,,,['R01 HL 42069/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,

In most populations the patterns for ALL are similar to those for total leukaema, with peak incidence at ages 1-4 and a decline thereafter. Lower and more uniform rates are generally observed at all ages for ANLL. Age-adjusted rates for ANLL appear to vary substantially among some populations with uniform ALL incidence rates (e.g., among Asians) and yet appear to be similar in other populations with variation in ALL rates (e.g., whites and blacks in the US).

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We reviewed infections that occurred in 86 consecutive patients with MDS who received care from 1968 to 1986 at a university-affiliated Veterans Affairs Medical Center. Time lines charting the course of each patient with MDS were created and included infections, MDS subgroup at the time of presentation and at the time of each infection, peripheral neutrophil counts, and therapies for MDS. RESULTS: Infections occurred at a rate of nearly one per patient year of observation. Infection rates were associated with MDS subgroup as follows: refractory anemia with or without ringed sideroblasts (RA +/- RS) less than refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB) less than RAEB in transformation (RAEB-T). The group of RA +/- RS patients who had erythroid abnormalities but minimal or no dyspoiesis of other cell lines had the lowest rate of infections. Infection rates were higher in patients with less than or equal to 1,000 neutrophils/microL blood than in patients with greater than 1,000 neutrophils/microL blood for each classifiable MDS subgroup. Neutrophil concentration and MDS subgroup were independent risk factors for infection in patients with MDS. Bacterial pneumonias and skin abscesses were the most common infections. Infection was the most common cause of death during MDS, accounting for 64% of deaths, and was more common than transformation to acute leukemia as a cause of death. CONCLUSION: Infection is a common, life-threatening problem in patients with MDS. Neutropenia and MDS subgroup are each risk factors for infection.

This report details the results of treatment of adult SNCL with a series of protocols originally designed for the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between July 1973 and May 1987, 29 adults with newly diagnosed SNCL were treated at Memorial Hospital with intensive chemotherapy originally designed for ALL: the cyclophosphamide L-2, L-10, L-17, and L-20 protocols. Nine patients had positive serologies for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. One patient with all measurable disease resected was not evaluable for response. RESULTS: Sixteen of 28 evaluable patients (57%) achieved a complete remission with treatment. With follow-up as long as 153 months (median, 47 months), 50% of all patients and 59% of patients with negative or unknown HIV serologies have survived and are probably cured. Patients with an initial serum lactic acid dehydrogenase (LDH) level of greater than 500 U/L had a significantly shortened survival as compared with those with a lower serum LDH. Other pretreatment patient characteristics associated with a shortened survival of borderline statistical significance were high National Cancer Institute stage (C, D) and bone marrow involvement. These results are similar to those for ALL and lymphoblastic lymphoma and are comparable to those for American SNCL in the literature. CONCLUSIONS: Approximately one half of adults with SNCL are curable with intensive chemotherapy. More intensive chemotherapy with hematopoietic growth factor and/or autologous bone marrow or peripheral stem cell support may increase curability.","['Straus, D J', 'Wong, G Y', 'Liu, J', 'Oppenberg, J', 'Filippa, D A', 'Gold, J W', 'Offit, K', 'Clarkson, B D']","['Straus DJ', 'Wong GY', 'Liu J', 'Oppenberg J', 'Filippa DA', 'Gold JW', 'Offit K', 'Clarkson BD']","['Division of Hematologic Oncology, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York 10021.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Med,The American journal of medicine,0267200,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hematologic Diseases/chemically induced', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/mortality/pathology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Radiotherapy Dosage', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Rate', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",1991/03/01 00:00,1991/03/01 00:01,['1991/03/01 00:00'],"['1991/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['0002-9343(91)80013-C [pii]'],ppublish,Am J Med. 1991 Mar;90(3):328-37.,['8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We previously showed that introduction of long terminal repeat (LTR) and gag-pol sequences from a strain of Friend murine leukemia virus (FB29) resulted in a dramatic acceleration of the onset of the disease. The chimeric virus FrCasE, which consisted of the FB29 genome containing 3' pol and env sequences from the wild mouse virus, induced a highly predictable, lethal neurodegenerative disease with an incubation period of only 16 days. Here we report that the sequences which are primary determinants of the length of the incubation period are located in the 5' end of the viral genome between a KpnI site in the R region of the LTR and a PstI site immediately 5' of the start codon for pr65gag (R-U5-5' leader). This region contains the tRNA primer binding site, splice donor site for the subgenomic env mRNA, and the packaging sequence. Computer-assisted sequence analysis failed to find evidence of a consensus sequence for a DNA enhancer in this region. In addition, sequences within a region of the genome between a ClaI site at the 3' end of env to the KpnI site in the R region of the LTR (inclusive of U3) also influenced the incubation period of the disease, but the effect was distinctly weaker than that of the R-U5-5' leader sequence. This U3 effect, however, appeared to be independent of the number of direct repeats, since deletion of one of two duplicated 42-base repeats containing consensus sequences of nuclear-factor binding domains had no effect on the incubation period of the disease. On the basis of Southern blot analysis of total viral DNA in the tissues, the effect of these sequences on the incubation period appeared to be related to the level of virus replication in the central nervous system. All of the chimeric viruses analyzed, irrespective of neurovirulence, replicated to comparable levels in the spleen and induced comparable levels of viremia.","['Portis, J L', 'Perryman, S', 'McAtee, F J']","['Portis JL', 'Perryman S', 'McAtee FJ']","['Laboratory of Persistent Viral Diseases, Rocky Mountain Laboratories, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Hamilton, Montana 59840.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Central Nervous System Diseases/genetics/*microbiology', 'Chimera', 'Consensus Sequence', 'DNA, Viral/metabolism', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Protein Sorting Signals/*genetics', 'RNA Splicing', 'RNA, Messenger/chemistry', '*Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Retroviridae/*genetics/pathogenicity', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/chemistry/genetics', 'Viremia/genetics', 'Virulence']",1991/04/01 00:00,1991/04/01 00:01,['1991/04/01 00:00'],"['1991/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.65.4.1877-1883.1991 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1991 Apr;65(4):1877-83. doi: 10.1128/JVI.65.4.1877-1883.1991.,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Protein Sorting Signals)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']",,,,,PMC239999,,"['GENBANK/M61066', 'GENBANK/M61067', 'GENBANK/M61068', 'GENBANK/M61069', 'GENBANK/M61070', 'GENBANK/M61071', 'GENBANK/M64447', 'GENBANK/M64448', 'GENBANK/M64452', 'GENBANK/Z11128']",,,,,,,,,

Three N10-propargyl-4-thio-5,8-dideazafolic acid analogues had C2 amino, hydrogen, and methyl substituents. A 4-thio and a 4-(methylthio) compound each with hydrogen at C2 and ethyl at N10 were also synthesized. In general, the synthetic route involved thionation of the appropriate 4-oxoquinazoline; the sulfur thus introduced was then protected by methylation. Further protection with a pivaloyl group was required for the quinazoline bearing a 2-amino substituent. The protected quinazolines were treated with N-bromosuccinimide and the resulting 6-(bromomethyl) compounds were then coupled to the appropriate N-monoalkylated diethyl N-(4-aminobenzoyl)-L-glutamate in N,N-dimethylacetamide with calcium carbonate as base. The 4-thio-5,8-dideazafolic acids were obtained by removal of the methylthio group with sodium hydrosulfide, followed by deprotection of the carboxyl groups with cold dilute alkali. For the compound containing a pivaloyl protecting group, hot dilute alkali was used. To obtain the 5,8-dideazafolic acid containing a 4-(methylthio) substituent, the corresponding diester was treated with lithium hydroxide which selectively deprotected the carboxyl groups. The five compounds were tested as inhibitors of L1210 TS. It was found that replacement of the 4-oxygen of the quinazoline moiety by sulfur did not alter the TS inhibition. However, the introduction of a methylthio substituent at position 4 severely impaired TS inhibition.

This virus is also unique in that it is able to transform hematopoietic cells of both the myeloid and the erythroid lineage. To determine the contributions of v-myb and v-ets to the transforming potential of the virus, derivatives expressing separate Myb and Ets proteins, either alone or in combination, were constructed. We found that in the myeloid lineage v-myb, but not v-ets, induces cell transformation. In the erythroid lineage both v-myb and v-ets weakly transform erythroblast-like cells. These cells exhibit a mature phenotype and a low self-renewal capacity. The transforming efficiency of the two oncogenes is enhanced if they are coexpressed as separate proteins or as a fusion protein, the transformed cells displaying an increased self-renewal capacity. Interestingly, however, cells transformed by the Myb-Ets fusion protein have a distinct phenotype in that they are very immature. These results demonstrate that v-myb and v-ets can cooperate in the transformation of erythroid cells both in trans and in cis and that the mode of cooperation is reflected by the differentiation phenotypes of the transformed cells.","['Metz, T', 'Graf, T']","['Metz T', 'Graf T']","['Differentiation Programme, European Molecular Biology Laboratory, Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Genes Dev,Genes & development,8711660,IM,"['Animals', '*Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Differentiation', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chickens', 'Erythroblasts/*cytology', 'Gene Expression', 'Histocytochemistry', 'Oncogene Proteins v-myb', '*Oncogenes', 'Phenotype', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/*genetics']",1991/03/01 00:00,1991/03/01 00:01,['1991/03/01 00:00'],"['1991/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1101/gad.5.3.369 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Dev. 1991 Mar;5(3):369-80. doi: 10.1101/gad.5.3.369.,"['0 (Oncogene Proteins v-myb)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '0 (oncogene proteins v-ets)']",,"['v-ets', 'v-myb']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients presenting with leukocyte counts less than 20,000/microliters were treated with CRA alone. Those with leukocyte counts of 20,000/microliters or greater were pretreated with hydroxyurea, followed by CRA. Twelve of 18 patients received at least 4 weeks of CRA and were thus considered evaluable for toxicity and response. No objective responses were observed. Cis-retinoic acid administration was well tolerated; only modest dermatologic, musculoskeletal, and gastrointestinal toxicity was observed.

Previously it has been suggested that the calcium ionophore, A23187, has effects on the early cellular events that lead to the commitment of these cells to differentiation, but was not in itself sufficient to induce differentiation. We demonstrate here that A23187, as well as another calcium ionophore, ionomycin, are capable of inducing commitment to differentiation. Unlike other inducing agents, continual exposure to A23187 inhibits transcription of the erythroid-specific genes, beta-globin and Band 3. This effect is not attributable to an increase in cytosolic calcium concentration, because cells induced by ionomycin produce normal amounts of hemoglobin. These effects of A23187 on MEL cells confirm that commitment to differentiation is a distinct event from the subsequent transcriptional activation of erythroid genes. The ability of both ionophores to induce commitment to differentiation suggests that an increase in cytosolic calcium can trigger commitment to differentiation. These agents should prove useful in investigating the cellular processes that are responsible for commitment to differentiation.","['Hensold, J O', 'Dubyak, G', 'Housman, D E']","['Hensold JO', 'Dubyak G', 'Housman DE']","['Center for Cancer Research, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Animals', 'Anion Exchange Protein 1, Erythrocyte/genetics/metabolism', 'Calcimycin/*pharmacology', 'Calcium/metabolism/physiology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/drug effects/metabolism/*pathology', 'Gene Expression/*drug effects', 'Globins/genetics/metabolism', 'Ionomycin/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*blood/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice']",1991/03/15 00:00,1991/03/15 00:01,['1991/03/15 00:00'],"['1991/03/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/03/15 00:01 [medline]', '1991/03/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)83037-7 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1991 Mar 15;77(6):1362-70.,"['0 (Anion Exchange Protein 1, Erythrocyte)', '37H9VM9WZL (Calcimycin)', '56092-81-0 (Ionomycin)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",,,,"['CA-17575/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK-01392/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'P30-CA-43703/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

FeTF activates protein kinase C (PKC) in the lymphoblastoid T-cell line, CCRF-CEM. We have treated CEM cells with human FeTF, then examined levels of PKC mRNA by hybridization analysis using cDNA probes specific for alpha-, beta-, and gamma-PKC subspecies. CEM cell mRNA hybridized with the beta-subspecies probe but not with probes for alpha- or gamma-subspecies. After exposure to FeTF an increase in PKC-beta mRNA was detectable at 10 minutes, peaked at 12 hours, and was sustained for 72 hours. Nuclear transcription assays demonstrated that rates of PKC-beta mRNA transcription were increased in FeTF-treated cells. By contrast, steady state levels of PKC-beta mRNA did not increase after treatment of cells with apotransferrin or gallium TF. Similarly, treatment with soluble iron as ferric ammonium citrate did not increase steady state levels of PKC-beta mRNA, despite producing a marked increase in cellular ferritin content. Ferritin increased from a baseline value of 63 ng/10(6) cells to 98 and 100 ng/10(6) cells in CEM cells treated for 1 hour with ferric ammonium citrate or FeTF, respectively. FeTF did not increase cytoplasmic-free calcium in CEM cells loaded with fura-2, indicating that binding of FeTF to transferrin receptors did not open membrane Ca2+ channels or release intracellular Ca2+. In addition, pretreatment of cells with desferrioxamine, but not ferrioxamine, blocked the FeTF-induced increase in PKC-beta transcripts. Therefore, iron as FeTF (not soluble iron or nonferric TF) stimulates transcription of the CEM cell PKC-beta gene. Transcriptional rate of the PKC-beta gene does not correlate with cellular iron content as judged by ferritin measurements. Furthermore, the requirement for FeTF does not appear to reflect activation of a classic agonist pathway as judged by stable cellular Ca2+. These data suggest that delivery of iron by FeTF to one or more specific cellular compartments may stimulate PKC-beta gene transcription in CEM cells.","['Alcantara, O', 'Javors, M', 'Boldt, D H']","['Alcantara O', 'Javors M', 'Boldt DH']","['Audie L.

The 50% inhibition by DEX of ionomycin elevation of [3H]arachidonate release was almost overcome by addition of TPA. The Ca2+ ionophore and antigen-induced increase in [3H]TPA binding to intact RBL cells was not impaired by DEX. However, DEX markedly reduced phosphorylation of several proteins. 1-Oleoyl-2-acetyl-glycerol (OAG) had a sustained stimulatory effect on PLA2 activity in isolated plasma membranes derived from treated bone-marrow intact mouse macrophages, while both DEX and staurosporine reduced elevated PLA2 activity by 68 and 84%, respectively.

Studies with human monocyte-derived macrophages showed a similar effect of dexamethasone on LPL expression. Peak LPL mRNA levels were achieved 24-h post-dexamethasone addition to THP-1 cells. Optimal stimulation of LPL mRNA occurred when dexamethasone was added 24 h after induction with PMA. Thereafter, there was rapid decline in responsiveness to dexamethasone. Induction of LPL mRNA in THP-1 cells was completely blocked by actinomycin D, suggesting that induction was transcription dependent. The stability of LPL mRNA was not influenced by dexamethasone. Treatment of THP-1 cells with PMA led to a 2-fold increase in specific binding of dexamethasone and a 4-fold increase in glucocorticoid receptor mRNA within 12 h.

Twenty four to thirty six hours after removal of PDBu from the medium there was a 3-fold increase in the number of receptors compared to baseline values measured by [3H]-PDBu binding and a marked increase in the activity of PKC as measured by calcium-phospholipid dependent incorporation of [32P] into histone. Despite these changes in the number of PER and in the activity of PKC there was no difference in the cellular accumulation of [3H]-daunomycin or in the sensitivity of cells to the toxic effects of doxorubicin. Furthermore, there was no difference between the R1B6 cells and the parental HL-60 line in their intrinsic sensitivities to doxorubicin.

Unfortunately, less than 30% of patients in the United States have an HLA-identical sibling; therefore, many are denied the opportunity for potentially curative treatment for otherwise fatal conditions. The results of marrow transplantation from haploidentical family members who were partially compatible for nonshared haplotypes with the patients demonstrated the relevance of HLA compatibility for engraftment and graft-vs-host disease. These results have provided the rationale for using HLA-identical unrelated volunteers as marrow donors. The recent development of a national registry of volunteer bone marrow donors (the National Marrow Donor Program in the United States) has made it possible to access a centralized file of more than 260,000 HLA-typed volunteers. Marrow transplants from an unrelated donor have become feasible. However, our preliminary clinical experience clearly demonstrated an increase in the incidence and severity of graft-vs-host disease. It is likely that standard HLA typing techniques are not adequate to provide data for sufficient donor and recipient matching. It is possible that currently available molecular technology could be applied to HLA typing and donor matching to improve on clinical results.","['Anasetti, C']",['Anasetti C'],"['Division of Clinical Research, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Wash.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Arch Pathol Lab Med,Archives of pathology & laboratory medicine,7607091,IM,"['*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Graft vs Host Disease/physiopathology', 'HLA Antigens/immunology', 'Heterozygote', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/analysis', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II/analysis', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Homozygote', 'Humans', 'Immunization', '*Immunogenetics', 'Isoantigens/analysis', '*Laboratories', 'Leukemia/mortality/therapy', 'Tissue Donors']",1991/03/01 00:00,1991/03/01 00:01,['1991/03/01 00:00'],"['1991/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Arch Pathol Lab Med. 1991 Mar;115(3):288-92.,"['0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)', '0 (Isoantigens)']",,,,"['CA15704/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA18029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA18221/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Philadelphia chromosome-positive patients.,532-8,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the frequency and the course of complete cytogenetic responses in interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha)-treated patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia. DESIGN: Two prospective trials in consecutive patients. SETTING: A major tertiary cancer center. PATIENTS: Ninety-six consecutive patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia with disease duration of less than 1 year. INTERVENTION: Patients received partially pure IFN-alpha intramuscularly, from 3 to 9 million U/d (51 patients) or recombinant IFN-alpha 2a (Roferon, Hoffmann-LaRoche, Inc., Nutley, New Jersey), 5 million U/m2 body surface area daily (45 patients). MEASUREMENTS: Hematologic and cytogenetic tests were administered. MAIN RESULTS: Seventy of the patients (73%) achieved hematologic remission (95% CI, 63% to 81%), and 18 (19%) had complete suppression of the Philadelphia chromosome on at least one cytogenetic test. A complete cytogenetic response was induced in 7 of 51 or 14% (CI, 6% to 26%) of the patients treated with the partially pure IFN-alpha and in 11 of 45 or 24% (CI, 13% to 40%) of the patients treated with recombinant IFN-alpha 2a. The difference in complete cytogenetic response between the two groups was 10.7% (CI, - 5% to 26%; P greater than 0.2). Eleven patients had durable, ongoing, complete cytogenetic responses from 6 to more than 45 months (median, more than 30 months). CONCLUSION: This study was the first to show sustained, complete cytogenetic responses in a subset of patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia treated with single-agent therapy. The nature of this remission, that is, whether it depends on continuous therapy, requires further study.","['Talpaz, M', 'Kantarjian, H', 'Kurzrock, R', 'Trujillo, J M', 'Gutterman, J U']","['Talpaz M', 'Kantarjian H', 'Kurzrock R', 'Trujillo JM', 'Gutterman JU']","['University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Ann Intern Med,Annals of internal medicine,0372351,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Interferon Type I/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Interferon alpha-2', 'Interferon-alpha/therapeutic use', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Prospective Studies', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Remission Induction/methods']",1991/04/01 00:00,1991/04/01 00:01,['1991/04/01 00:00'],"['1991/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.7326/0003-4819-114-7-532 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Intern Med. 1991 Apr 1;114(7):532-8. doi: 10.7326/0003-4819-114-7-532.,"['0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (Interferon alpha-2)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Experimental procedures included single and double labeling in situ immunohistochemistry with selective morphometric analyses, and steady state immunoblotting of viral proteins. Cellular targets for virus infection were identical for both ts1 and wt MoMuLV and consisted sequentially of 1) splenic megakaryocytes, 2) splenic and thymic lymphocytes, 3) CNS capillary endothelial cells, and 4) CNS pericytes and microglia. Resident microglial cells served as the major reservor and amplifier of virus infection in the CNS of ts1 MoMuLV-infected mice; a similar but much less significant role was played by microglia in wt MoMuLV-infected mice. The genesis and progression of severe spongiform lesions in ts1 MoMuLV-infected mice were both temporally and spatially correlated with amplified virus infection of microglia, and hyperplasia and hypertrophy of both virus-infected and nonvirus-infected microglial cells. Direct virus infection of neurons was never observed. The development of clinical neurologic disease and spongiform lesions in ts1 MoMuLV-infected mice correlated with the accumulation of both viral gag and env gene products in the CNS; there was no selective accumulation of env precursor polyprotein Pr80env. When compared to wt MoMuLV-infected mice, the neurovirulence of ts1 MoMuLV-infected mice occurred by an enhanced ability to replicate in the CNS and to infect and activate more microglia, rather than by a fundamental change in cellular tropism or topography of virus infection.","['Baszler, T V', 'Zachary, J F']","['Baszler TV', 'Zachary JF']","['Department of Veterinary Pathobiology, College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Illinois, Urbana.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Pathol,The American journal of pathology,0370502,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/analysis', 'Central Nervous System/immunology/metabolism/*microbiology/pathology', 'Central Nervous System Diseases/*microbiology/pathology', 'Immunoblotting', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/immunology/*pathogenicity/physiology', 'Spleen/immunology', 'Thymus Gland/immunology', 'Viral Proteins/analysis', 'Virulence', '*Virus Replication']",1991/03/01 00:00,1991/03/01 00:01,['1991/03/01 00:00'],"['1991/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Am J Pathol. 1991 Mar;138(3):655-71.,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Viral Proteins)']",,,,,PMC1886285,,,['Am J Pathol 1991 May;138(5):1058'],,,,,,,,

To directly determine whether RI alpha is a growth-inducing protein essential for neoplastic cell growth, human HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cells were exposed to 21-mer RI alpha antisense oligodeoxynucleotide, and the effects on cell replication and differentiation were examined. The RI alpha antisense oligomer brought about growth inhibition and monocytic differentiation, bypassing the effects of an exogenous cAMP analog. These effects of RI alpha antisense oligodeoxynucleotide correlated with a decrease in RI alpha receptor and an increase in RII beta receptor level. The growth inhibition and differentiation were abolished, however, when these cells were exposed simultaneously to both RI alpha and RII beta antisense oligodeoxynucleotides. The RII beta antisense oligodeoxynucleotide alone has been previously shown to specifically block the differentiation inducible by cAMP analogs.

Furthermore, the antibodies detected a unique 190 kd protein as well as 150 kd protein in a cell lysate from THP-1 human monocytic leukemia cell line, suggesting that glycosylated forms of the c-ret protein are different between neuroblastoma and leukemia cells.","['Takahashi, M', 'Buma, Y', 'Taniguchi, M']","['Takahashi M', 'Buma Y', 'Taniguchi M']","['Second Department of Pathology, Nagoya University, School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'DNA/metabolism', '*Drosophila Proteins', 'Escherichia coli/genetics', 'Glycoproteins/analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*metabolism/pathology', 'Neuroblastoma/*chemistry/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*analysis/genetics/immunology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ret', '*Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1991/02/01 00:00,1991/02/01 00:01,['1991/02/01 00:00'],"['1991/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncogene. 1991 Feb;6(2):297-301.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Drosophila Proteins)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ret)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Ret protein, Drosophila)']",,['ret'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To establish their hematopoietic expression patterns, we have isolated murine LYL and SCL cDNA clones and investigated the expression of all three genes by Northern blot analysis of 58 murine hemopoietic cell lines and tissues. The nucleotide sequences of LYL cDNA clones revealed alternative 5' untranslated sequences and differential splicing within the 5' portion of the coding region that may produce a LYL polypeptide lacking an N-terminal segment. The LYL gene was expressed in most myeloid, erythroid and B lymphocyte cell lines and displayed two alternative size classes of transcripts, the smaller size class (1.5-1.8 kb) being typical of the erythroid lineage and the larger class (2.0-2.3 kb) of the B cell lineage. These two size classes were found to differ in the 5' untranslated region. Thus, expression of the LYL gene appears to be differentially regulated in different hemopoietic cell types. In contrast, the E2A gene was expressed throughout the hemopoietic compartment as a single dominant transcript (3.5 kb). SCL expression was restricted to erythroid, mast and early myeloid cell lines, and the level of SCL transcripts (3.0 and 4.7 kb species) increased markedly during DMSO-induced differentiation of erythro-leukemia cells. Hence the SCL gene product may be an important regulatory factor for the erythroid lineage. The low or undetectable expression of both SCL and LYL in most T lymphoid cell sources is consistent with the view that the translocations of these genes in human T cell leukemias alter their normal regulation and may thereby contribute to neoplasia.","['Visvader, J', 'Begley, C G', 'Adams, J M']","['Visvader J', 'Begley CG', 'Adams JM']","['Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Royal Melbourne Hospital, Victoria, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'DNA/analysis', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/metabolism', '*Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Hematopoietic System/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*genetics', 'Mast Cells/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Oncogenes', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'TCF Transcription Factors', 'Transcription Factor 7-Like 1 Protein', '*Transcription Factors', '*Translocation, Genetic']",1991/02/01 00:00,1991/02/01 00:01,['1991/02/01 00:00'],"['1991/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncogene. 1991 Feb;6(2):187-94.,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (TCF Transcription Factors)', '0 (TCF7L1 protein, human)', '0 (Tcf7l1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factor 7-Like 1 Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",,"['E2A', 'LYL', 'SCL']",,['CA12421/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,"['GENBANK/S59631', 'GENBANK/S59635', 'GENBANK/S59842', 'GENBANK/S74923', 'GENBANK/S74924', 'GENBANK/S74925', 'GENBANK/S74926', 'GENBANK/X57686', 'GENBANK/X57687', 'GENBANK/X59065']",,,,,,,,,

In man, inherited deficiency of Leu-CAMs is characterised by recurrent, sometimes fatal, bacterial infections. In animals, on the other hand, Leu-CAM blocking by monoclonal antibodies has been found beneficial in inflammatory disorders. As some lymphoid malignancies are devoid of CAMs, it is possible that their absence may be a contributing factor in the development of leukaemia and lymphoma.","['Patarroyo, M', 'Lindbom, L']","['Patarroyo M', 'Lindbom L']","['Immunologiska institutionen, Karolinska institutet, Stockholm.']",['swe'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Sweden,Lakartidningen,Lakartidningen,0027707,IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Humans', 'Inflammation/*immunology', 'Leukemia/immunology', 'Leukocytes/*immunology', 'Lymphoma/immunology', 'Receptors, Leukocyte-Adhesion/*immunology']",1991/01/16 00:00,1991/01/16 00:01,['1991/01/16 00:00'],"['1991/01/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/16 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/16 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Lakartidningen. 1991 Jan 16;88(3):120-2.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Receptors, Leukocyte-Adhesion)']",3,,Leukocytadhesion: En fundamental process vid immunologiska och inflammatoriska reaktioner.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In cultures with a poorly formed adherent layer (all derived from patients classified as M5), the endogenous levels of CSF-1 were lower than those in cultures with a good (confluent) adherent layer, indicating that the levels of CSF-1 in LTC from AML patients positively correlate with the formation of the adherent layer.

This MoAB (anti-MKW) does not cluster with antibodies in any of the known cluster groups of differentiation. Blast cell expression of MKW was studied in 196 consecutively diagnosed children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), 69 children with previously untreated acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) and four children with secondary AML. MKW expression, clinical, laboratory and cytogenetic features at diagnosis, and treatment response and duration were examined for significant correlations.

The expression of MKW appears to be more common in patients with secondary AML (three of four) than de novo AML (17 of 69). In patients with AML, the expression of MKW was correlated with an elevated initial leukocyte count (p = 0.0005) and poorer disease-free survival (p = 0.04).

The disease-free survival was also poorer for ALL patients with greater than or equal to 50% MKW+ blasts (p = 0.02).

Nine cases with a 19p13 breakpoint, four having a phenotype other than pre-B, have been investigated with the E12 probe to the E2A gene. Five cases had t(1;19) (q23;p13) and C-ALL with pre-B phenotype in four out of four cases tested. Two cases had t(1;19) (q21;p13), one with Null cell phenotype, t(4;11), and 'jumping translocations' and the other with acute non-lymphocytic leukemia M5 following bone marrow transplantation for C-ALL. Variant translocations in patients with ALL were t(15;19) (q15;p13) and t(17;19) (q21;p13). Southern blotting with E12 showed rearrangement in the cases with t(1;19) (q23;p13) and t(1;19) (q21;p13), but not in other cases with variant 19p13 breakpoints. Thus rearrangement of the E2A gene is not restricted to cases with pre-B ALL but may also occur in acute leukemias with other immunological phenotypes. Failure to detect rearrangement in 19p13 variants may be due to an E2A breakpoint outside the E12 recognition region. Alternatively, there may be further genes in this location with relevance to leukemogenesis.","['Yamada, T', 'Craig, J M', 'Hawkins, J M', 'Janossy, G', 'Secker-Walker, L M']","['Yamada T', 'Craig JM', 'Hawkins JM', 'Janossy G', 'Secker-Walker LM']","['Department of Haematology Royal Free Hospital, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Animals', 'Blotting, Southern', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 1', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 19', 'DNA Probes', 'Female', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Phenotype', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/immunology', '*Translocation, Genetic']",1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1991 Jan;5(1):36-40.,['0 (DNA Probes)'],,,,,,,,['Leukemia 1991 Apr;5(4):356'],,,,,,,,

The following mean (+/- SE) values were observed in patients and controls, respectively: 35 +/- 14.7 (range 0.5-500) and 0.7 +/- 0.02 (0.5-0.8 U/ml for IL-2 (p = 0.001); 1622 +/- 289 (110-10,600) and 422 +/- 30 (207-666) U/ml for sIL-2R (p = 0.0001); 1247 +/- 196 (218-4672) and 152 +/- 11 (75-308) pg/ml for TNF-alpha (p = 0.0001). With respect to the FAB classification system, we found a significantly different distribution of serum IL-2 mean values in distinct subcategories, i.e. 3.4 +/- 1.9 U/ml in M1-M2-M3 and 42.4 +/- 20.4 U/ml in M4-M5 subgroups, respectively (p = 0.01), whereas sIL-2R and TNF-alpha levels were 1144 +/- 322 U/ml and 1120 +/- 317 pg/ml in M1-M2-M3 patients and 1945 +/- 317 U/ml and 1270 +/- 259 pg/ml in the M4-M5 group.

A survey of mortality nationwide and incidence in two states.,1403-8,"Reports from the United Kingdom have described increases in leukemia and lymphoma among young persons living near certain nuclear installations. Because of concerns raised by these reports, a mortality survey was conducted in populations living near nuclear facilities in the United States. All facilities began service before 1982. Over 900,000 cancer deaths occurred from 1950 through 1984 in 107 counties with or near nuclear installations. Each study county was matched for comparison to three ""control counties"" in the same region. There were 1.8 million cancer deaths in the 292 control counties during the 35 years studied. Deaths due to leukemia or other cancers were not more frequent in the study counties than in the control counties. For childhood leukemia mortality, the relative risk comparing the study counties with their controls before plant start-up was 1.08, while after start-up it was 1.03. For leukemia mortality at all ages, the relative risks were 1.02 before start-up and 0.98 after. For counties in two states, cancer incidence data were also available. For one facility, the standardized registration ratio for childhood leukemia was increased significantly after start-up. However, the increase also antedated the operation of this facility. The study is limited by the correlational approach and the large size of the geographic areas (counties) used. It does not prove the absence of any effect. If, however, any excess cancer risk was present in US counties with nuclear facilities, it was too small to be detected with the methods employed.","['Jablon, S', 'Hrubec, Z', 'Boice, J D Jr']","['Jablon S', 'Hrubec Z', 'Boice JD Jr']","['Radiation Epidemiology Branch, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD 20892.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,JAMA,JAMA,7501160,IM,"['Adult', 'Child', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/epidemiology/mortality', 'Male', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/epidemiology/*mortality', '*Nuclear Reactors', 'Risk Factors', 'United States/epidemiology']",1991/03/30 19:15,2001/03/28 10:01,['1991/03/30 19:15'],"['1991/03/30 19:15 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1991/03/30 19:15 [entrez]']",,ppublish,JAMA. 1991 Mar 20;265(11):1403-8.,,,,,,,['JAMA. 1991 Aug 7;266(5):652-5.

Evidence of radiation effects in follow-up through 1984.,1397-402,"White men hired at the Oak Ridge (Tenn) National Laboratory between 1943 and 1972 were followed up for vital status through 1984 (N = 8318, 1524 deaths). Relatively low mortality compared with that in US white men was observed for most causes of death, but leukemia mortality was elevated in the total cohort (63% higher, 28 deaths) and in workers who had at some time been monitored for internal radionuclide contamination (123% higher, 16 deaths). Median cumulative dose of external penetrating radiation was 1.4 mSv; 638 workers had cumulative doses above 50 mSv (5 rem). After accounting for age, birth cohort, a measure of socioeconomic status, and active worker status, external radiation with a 20-year exposure lag was related to all causes of death (2.68% increase per 10 mSv) primarily due to an association with cancer mortality (4.94% per 10 mSv). Studies of this population through 1977 did not find radiation-cancer mortality associations, and identical analyses using the shorter follow-up showed that associations with radiation did not appear until after 1977. The radiation-cancer dose response is 10 times higher than estimates from the follow-up of survivors of the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan, but similar to one previous occupational study. Dose-response estimates are subject to uncertainties due to potential problems, including measurement of radiation doses and cancer outcomes. Longer-term follow-up of this and other populations with good measurement of protracted low-level exposures will be critical to evaluating the generalizability of the results reported herein.","['Wing, S', 'Shy, C M', 'Wood, J L', 'Wolf, S', 'Cragle, D L', 'Frome, E L']","['Wing S', 'Shy CM', 'Wood JL', 'Wolf S', 'Cragle DL', 'Frome EL']","['Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill 27599-7400.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,JAMA,JAMA,7501160,IM,"['Cause of Death', 'Cohort Studies', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/mortality', 'Lung Neoplasms/mortality', 'Male', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*mortality', '*Nuclear Energy', 'Occupational Diseases/*mortality', 'Occupational Exposure', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Radiation Injuries/*mortality', 'Radiation Monitoring', 'Radiation, Ionizing', 'Tennessee/epidemiology']",1991/03/20 00:00,1991/03/20 00:01,['1991/03/20 00:00'],"['1991/03/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/03/20 00:01 [medline]', '1991/03/20 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,JAMA. 1991 Mar 20;265(11):1397-402.,,,,,,,"['JAMA. 1992 Feb 19;267(7):929-30.

None of the current approaches to prevention of GVHD succeed at meeting these expectations, although postgrafting immunosuppressive therapy comes closest to the ideal. The technique of T cell depletion has been very effective in reducing the incidence of GVHD, but conditioning programs must be developed that will be more successful at eliminating host immune and malignant cells. It is doubtful that this will be achieved with systemic chemotherapy and total body irradiation. Innovative approaches such as the use of monoclonal antibodies, either alone or linked to short-lived radioactive isotopes with short linear energy transfer, promise to result in less toxic but more efficient programs, not only providing better eradication of malignant disease but also ameliorating the problem of graft failure. It is conceivable, however, that it will never be possible to kill all leukemic cells with chemoradiotherapy of any form, and the graft-versus-leukemia effect may be essential. Perhaps in the future it will be possible to distinguish lymphocytes causing the graft-versus-leukemia effect from those causing GVHD, isolate them, and use them in attempts at therapy. In the meantime, postgrafting immunosuppressive drugs are used most frequently to prevent and treat GVHD, and steadily improving survival statistics can be expected.","['Storb, R']",['Storb R'],"['Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA 98104.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,J Pediatr,The Journal of pediatrics,0375410,IM,"['Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*drug therapy/*etiology', 'Humans']",1991/03/01 00:00,1991/03/01 00:01,['1991/03/01 00:00'],"['1991/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0022-3476(05)82183-3 [pii]', '10.1016/s0022-3476(05)82183-3 [doi]']",ppublish,J Pediatr. 1991 Mar;118(3):S10-3. doi: 10.1016/s0022-3476(05)82183-3.,,33,,,"['CA 18029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 18221/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 31787/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,['NASA: 91154979'],,,,,,

M195 was trace-labeled with iodine-131 (131I) to allow detailed pharmacokinetic and dosimetric studies by serial sampling of blood and bone marrow and whole-body gamma-camera imaging. Total doses up to 76 mg were administered safely without immediate adverse effects. Absorption of M195 onto targets in vivo was demonstrated by biopsy, pharmacology, flow cytometry, and imaging; saturation of available sites occurred at doses greater than or equal to 5 mg/m2. The entire bone marrow was specifically and clearly imaged beginning within hours after injection; optimal imaging occurred at the lowest dose. Bone marrow biopsies demonstrated significant dose-related uptake of M195 as early as 1 hour after infusion in all patients, with the majority of the dose found in the marrow. Tumor regressions were not observed. An estimated 0.33 to 1.0 rad/mCi 131I was delivered to the whole body, 1.1 to 6.1 rad/mCi was delivered to the plasma, and up to 34 rad/mCi was delivered to the red marrow compartment. 131I-M195 was rapidly modulated, with a majority of the bound immunoglobulin G (IgG) being internalized into target cells in vivo. These data indicate that whole bone marrow ablative doses of 131I-M195 can be expected. The rapid, specific, and quantitative delivery to the bone marrow and the efficient internalization of M195 into target cells in vivo also suggest that the delivery of other isotopes such as auger or alpha emitters, toxins, or other biologically important molecules into either leukemia cells or normal hematopoietic progenitor cells may be feasible.","['Scheinberg, D A', 'Lovett, D', 'Divgi, C R', 'Graham, M C', 'Berman, E', 'Pentlow, K', 'Feirt, N', 'Finn, R D', 'Clarkson, B D', 'Gee, T S']","['Scheinberg DA', 'Lovett D', 'Divgi CR', 'Graham MC', 'Berman E', 'Pentlow K', 'Feirt N', 'Finn RD', 'Clarkson BD', 'Gee TS', 'et al.']","['Clinical Immunology, Leukemia, Nuclear Medicine Services, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10021.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/diagnostic imaging/*metabolism', 'Drug Evaluation', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Half-Life', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Iodine Radioisotopes', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Radionuclide Imaging']",1991/03/01 00:00,1991/03/01 00:01,['1991/03/01 00:00'],"['1991/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1991.9.3.478 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1991 Mar;9(3):478-90. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1991.9.3.478.,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Iodine Radioisotopes)']",,,,['P01 CA33049/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,

ALL colonies increased numerically by 72% (P less than .025) and AML colonies by 92% (P less than .01) in the presence of hGH at concentrations of 2.5 x 10(2) and 3.0 x 10(2) ng/mL, respectively. IGF-1 stimulated ALL and AML blast-colony growth at concentrations ranging from 0.05 to 0.5 ng/mL by up to 105% (P less than .025) and 65% (P less than .03), respectively. Our in vitro data suggest that circulating hGH and IGF-1 may promote leukemic blast cell replication in vivo, and the supplemental administration of hGH to leukemia patients in remission must be carefully monitored for early relapse.","['Estrov, Z', 'Meir, R', 'Barak, Y', 'Zaizov, R', 'Zadik, Z']","['Estrov Z', 'Meir R', 'Barak Y', 'Zaizov R', 'Zadik Z']","['Efrati Institute for Blood Cell Research and Cytology, Department of Internal Medicine B, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['Bone Marrow/*drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Growth Hormone/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor I/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",1991/03/01 00:00,1991/03/01 00:01,['1991/03/01 00:00'],"['1991/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1991.9.3.394 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1991 Mar;9(3):394-9. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1991.9.3.394.,"['67763-96-6 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor I)', '9002-72-6 (Growth Hormone)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Possible association of ganglioside-induced inhibition of insulin receptor function and monocytic differentiation induction in HL-60 cells.,4531-7,"Insulin-dependent cell growth has been correlated with insulin receptor function, particularly receptor-associated kinase activity, in in vitro studies. The insulin-dependent phosphorylation of the 95-kDa receptor subunit was clearly inhibited, in a concentration-dependent manner, by the presence of unbranched neolacto series gangliosides having a NeuAc2----3Gal terminus, particularly 2----3-sialosylparagloboside (2----3SPG; IV3NeuAc-nLc4), but not by other gangliosides with a NeuAc2----6Gal terminus or by branched neolacto series gangliosides (e.g. G10). Such inhibition of phosphorylation was minimal with ganglio series gangliosides and negligible with sphingosine, neutral glycolipids, or sulfatide. 2----3SPG did not affect insulin binding to the insulin receptor. Insulin-dependent cell growth and its inhibition by 2----3SPG were observed in three human cell lines so far tested: lymphoid cell line IM9, promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL-60, and erythroleukemia cell line K562. Since IM9 cells contain a much higher quantity of insulin receptor than do HL-60 or K562 cells, insulin-dependent receptor phosphorylation and its inhibition by 2----3SPG in intact cells were clearly observed with IM9 cells. Receptor phosphorylation in intact cells was inhibited when cells were preincubated in the presence of 2----3SPG. Insulin-dependent growth of HL-60 and K562 cells was also inhibited by prolonged culture (96-144 h) with exogenous 2----3SPG. Subsequent to the inhibition of insulin-dependent HL-60 cell growth, a remarkable phenotypic transformation was observed, i.e. changes in morphology, enzymes, and cell-surface markers to those characteristic of monocytes. The level of 2----3SPG in HL-60 cells increased when cells were cultured with 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 to the same degree seen in cells cultured with 5 microM 2----3SPG. Both these treatments led to inhibition of insulin-dependent cell growth, followed by induction of monocytic differentiation. Thus, the cellular level of 2----3SPG may modulate insulin-dependent cell growth and define the lineage specificity of differentiation through modulation of receptor-associated kinase activity.","['Nojiri, H', 'Stroud, M', 'Hakomori, S']","['Nojiri H', 'Stroud M', 'Hakomori S']","['Biomembrane Institute, Seattle, Washington 98119.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/analysis', 'Carbohydrate Sequence', 'Cell Differentiation', '*Cell Division', 'Gangliosides/*physiology', 'Globosides/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Insulin/*physiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', 'Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Monocytes/*cytology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Receptor, Insulin/*metabolism', 'Sphingosine/pharmacology', 'Sulfoglycosphingolipids/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1991/03/05 00:00,1991/03/05 00:01,['1991/03/05 00:00'],"['1991/03/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/03/05 00:01 [medline]', '1991/03/05 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(20)64355-1 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1991 Mar 5;266(7):4531-7.,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (Gangliosides)', '0 (Globosides)', '0 (Insulin)', '0 (Sulfoglycosphingolipids)', '56573-54-7 (paragloboside)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Insulin)', 'NGZ37HRE42 (Sphingosine)']",,,,['CA 42505/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,

As part of a phase I-II study, amsacrine and teniposide were given as continuous 72-h i.v. infusions at doses of 75-150 and 150-250 mg m-2 day-1, respectively. Plasma samples obtained during steady state were analyzed for drug concentrations by high-performance liquid chromatography assays specific for each compound. Clearance and systemic exposure values for both amsacrine and teniposide were calculated for 14 patients, and data were available for teniposide alone in an additional 14 subjects. Interpatient variability in clearance was substantial for each drug, producing overlapping systemic exposure across dose levels. No evidence of dose-dependent drug clearance was evident. Clearance values for teniposide given in combination with amsacrine were similar to previous values obtained when teniposide was given in an identical manner but as a single agent. In all, 80% of patients experienced some degree of mucositis after chemotherapy administration.

We have used a single-block procedure in which a differentiation-specific inhibitor of a temperature-sensitive (ts) differentiation-defective mutation was used to block the differentiation program. Later, the block was removed, differentiation was allowed to proceed, and the time required to reach a reference marker was monitored. These studies have indicated that the mutations tsC2GP1 and tsB5A, the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor 3-aminobenzamide, and the glucocorticoid hormone dexamethasone blocked functions which are required just prior to commitment. We have also used a double-block procedure involving two consecutive restrictive conditions, which suggests that the 3-aminobenzamide- and tsC2GP1-blocked functions constitute a part of a sequentially ordered pathway leading to terminal differentiation. The convergence of the 3-aminobenzamide, dexamethasone, and ts mutational blocks just prior to commitment suggests that the blocked functions may be part of a major control mechanism for commitment. In these studies, we have introduced a cytochalasin B-based assay to monitor commitment. The use of cytochalasin B permits a direct assay for commitment and obviates the need for colony-forming assays using semisolid medium, which have inherent problems such as efficiency of plating.","['Ebisuzaki, K', 'Casley, W L', 'Griffiths, A', 'Wheaton, L']","['Ebisuzaki K', 'Casley WL', 'Griffiths A', 'Wheaton L']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Western Ontario, London, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cytochalasin B/pharmacology', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', '*Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mutation', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1991/03/15 00:00,1991/03/15 00:01,['1991/03/15 00:00'],"['1991/03/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/03/15 00:01 [medline]', '1991/03/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1991 Mar 15;51(6):1668-73.,"['3CHI920QS7 (Cytochalasin B)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We generated ALAK cells from seven patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) following Campath-1-depleted bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Five had relapsed and were in chronic phase, one had cytogenetic evidence of relapse and one had prior evidence of cytogenetic relapse but was in complete remission at time of study. Phenotypically the ALAK cells included both CD56+/CD3- NK cells and CD56-/CD3+ T cells. The CD3- subpopulation were studied cytogenetically and their functional activity tested in a 4 h 51Cr release cytotoxicity assay using the pretransplant leukaemia cells as targets. Cytogenetic studies showed that the ALAK cells from six patients were Ph negative, and where donor and recipient were sex mismatched, ALAK cells were exclusively of donor origin. In one patient ALAK cells were Ph positive and of recipient origin in eight of nine metaphases. In the 51Cr release assay the ALAK cells showed significant lysis of the pretransplant leukaemia in five of the seven patients tested. These data indicate that in CML patients who relapse post-BMT the NK cells are usually of donor origin but may be recipient-derived. In most patients these ALAK cells have antileukaemic activity in vitro.","['Mackinnon, S', 'Bungey, J', 'Chase, A', 'Paulsen, W', 'Hows, J M', 'Goldman, J M']","['Mackinnon S', 'Bungey J', 'Chase A', 'Paulsen W', 'Hows JM', 'Goldman JM']","['MRC/LRF Leukaemia Unit, Royal Postgraduate Medical School, London.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Killer Cells, Lymphokine-Activated/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/*immunology/surgery', 'Male', 'Recurrence']",1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1991.tb07949.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1991 Jan;77(1):60-5. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1991.tb07949.x.,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Five patients relapsed. The median time to relapse after commencing rhIL-2 was 26 weeks (range 2-44). Four patients were studied at relapse. The morphological and cytochemical features at relapse and presentation were similar. Cytogenetic analysis at relapse in patients 1 and 3 showed a normal karyotype. At relapse, patient 4 had the abnormality 46,XY, t(2;3). Patient 2 had the chromosomal abnormality t(8;21) at presentation and relapse. Patients 3 and 4 with M5 AML relapsed rapidly at 2 and 9 weeks after starting rhIL-2 treatment. Relapse leukaemia cells had features normally associated with lymphoid development. Patient 3 was TdT positive, with rearranged immunoglobulin genes, and a proportion of cells expressing the CD7 antigen; patient 4 also expressed the CD7 antigen. Relapse leukaemic cells from three of four patients expressed the alpha chain of the IL-2 receptor as assessed by flow cytometry. After overnight incubation and removal of T-lymphocytes the proportion of cells from these patients expressing the alpha chain increased from 15% to 61% (P less than 0.01). Using tritiated thymidine uptake to assess cell proliferation, two of three patients who expressed the IL-2 receptor alpha chain proliferated in response to 1000 u/ml of rhIL-2 in vitro, with a stimulation index greater than 1.95 (P less than 0.05). Following rhIL-2 immunotherapy for AML, relapse cells may express an inducible form of the alpha chain of the IL-2 receptor, which can mediate a proliferative response. It is possible that rhIL-2 when administered to AML patients in remission, may induce relapse. This may be a particular risk in patients with the M5 subtype.","['Macdonald, D', 'Jiang, Y Z', 'Swirsky, D', 'Vulliamy, T', 'Morilla, R', 'Bungey, J', 'Barrett, A J']","['Macdonald D', 'Jiang YZ', 'Swirsky D', 'Vulliamy T', 'Morilla R', 'Bungey J', 'Barrett AJ']","['Department of Haematology, Royal Postgraduate Medical School, Hammersmith Hospital, London.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Adult', 'Female', 'Gene Rearrangement/physiology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/immunology/*therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/*analysis', 'Recombinant Proteins/therapeutic use', 'Recurrence']",1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1991.tb07946.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1991 Jan;77(1):43-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1991.tb07946.x.,"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",,,,,,['Br J Haematol. 1991 Oct;79(2):345.

The sensitivity of the cap-region sequences to antisense inhibition of c-myc p65 expression was two to three times that of the original initiation codon antisense sequence. The other target sequences downstream of the cap and up to the AUG initiation codon were comparable to the initiation codon sequence, except that the first splice junction was slightly more sensitive. At the primary initiation codon target, a dodecamer was about half as effective as the original pentadecamer, whereas an octadecamer was about twice as effective. The observation of variation in antisense efficacy as a function of target location in c-myc mRNA may represent a combination of the effects of hybrid arrest, RNase H attack, and interference in RNA processing.

We therefore assessed the cardiac status of 115 children who had been treated for acute lymphoblastic leukemia with doxorubicin 1 to 15 years earlier in whom the disease was in continuous remission. METHODS: Eighteen patients received one dose of doxorubicin (45 mg per square meter of body-surface area), and 97 received multiple doses totaling 228 to 550 mg per square meter (median, 360). The median interval between the end of treatment and the cardiac evaluation was 6.4 years. Our evaluation consisted of a history, 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic recording, exercise testing, and echocardiography. RESULTS: Fifty-seven percent of the patients had abnormalities of left ventricular afterload (measured as end-systolic wall stress) or contractility (measured as the stress-velocity index). The cumulative dose of doxorubicin was the most significant predictor of abnormal cardiac function (P less than 0.002). Seventeen percent of patients who received one dose of doxorubicin had slightly elevated age-adjusted afterload, and none had decreased contractility. In contrast, 65 percent of patients who received at least 228 mg of doxorubicin per square meter had increased afterload (59 percent of patients), decreased contractility (23 percent), or both. Increased afterload was due to reduced ventricular wall thickness, not to hypertension or ventricular dilatation. In multivariate analyses restricted to patients who received at least 228 mg of doxorubicin per square meter, the only significant predictive factors were a higher cumulative dose (P = 0.01), which predicted decreased contractility, and an age of less than four years at treatment (P = 0.003), which predicted increased afterload. Afterload increased progressively in 24 of 34 patients evaluated serially (71 percent). Reported symptoms correlated poorly with indexes of exercise tolerance or ventricular function. Eleven patients had congestive heart failure within one year of treatment with doxorubicin; five of them had recurrent heart failure 3.7 to 10.3 years after completing doxorubicin treatment, and two required heart transplantation. No patient had late heart failure as a new event. CONCLUSIONS: Doxorubicin therapy in childhood impairs myocardial growth in a dose-related fashion and results in a progressive increase in left ventricular afterload sometimes accompanied by reduced contractility. We hypothesize that the loss of myocytes during doxorubicin therapy in childhood might result in inadequate left ventricular mass and clinically important heart disease in later years.","['Lipshultz, S E', 'Colan, S D', 'Gelber, R D', 'Perez-Atayde, A R', 'Sallan, S E', 'Sanders, S P']","['Lipshultz SE', 'Colan SD', 'Gelber RD', 'Perez-Atayde AR', 'Sallan SE', 'Sanders SP']","[""Department of Cardiology, Children's Hospital, Boston, MA 02115.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,N Engl J Med,The New England journal of medicine,0255562,IM,"['Child', 'Doxorubicin/*adverse effects', 'Echocardiography', 'Electrocardiography, Ambulatory', 'Exercise Test', 'Heart Failure/*chemically induced/physiopathology', 'Humans', 'Logistic Models', 'Myocardial Contraction/drug effects', 'Myocardium/pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/physiopathology', 'Risk Factors', 'Stroke Volume', 'Ventricular Function, Left/physiology']",1991/03/21 00:00,1991/03/21 00:01,['1991/03/21 00:00'],"['1991/03/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/03/21 00:01 [medline]', '1991/03/21 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1056/NEJM199103213241205 [doi]'],ppublish,N Engl J Med. 1991 Mar 21;324(12):808-15. doi: 10.1056/NEJM199103213241205.,['80168379AG (Doxorubicin)'],,,,"['CA06516/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA34183/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL01816/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,['N Engl J Med. 1991 Mar 21;324(12):843-5.

The relations of myeloid-antigen expression to other features of ALL and to prognosis have been controversial. METHODS: We analyzed clinical and laboratory features present at diagnosis in 236 consecutive cases of ALL in children. Immunophenotyping, including single- and dual-fluorescence analyses, was used to classify leukemic cells as B or T lymphoblasts and also to identify myeloid-antigen expression--the simultaneous expression of lymphoid-associated antigens and at least one of three myeloid-associated antigens (CD33, CD13, and CD14) on cells classified as L1 or L2 according to the French-American-British system. RESULTS: Forty-five of 185 patients with B-lineage ALL had myeloid-antigen expression, as did 8 of 41 patients with T-lineage ALL. In 10 patients, the lineage could not be determined. Myeloid-antigen expression was associated with L2 morphology (P less than 0.05), but it did not correlate with other prognostic features recognized previously. Multivariate analysis showed that myeloid-antigen expression was an important predictor of relapse in childhood ALL and the most significant prognostic factor statistically (P less than 0.0001). A white-cell count greater than or equal to 50 x 10(9) per liter at diagnosis was also an important and highly significant prognostic feature (P less than 0.001). After 40 months, the estimated disease-free survival for patients with ALL was 84 percent for those without myeloid-antigen expression and with a low white-cell count, 57 percent for those without myeloid-antigen expression and with a high white-cell count, 47 percent for those with myeloid-antigen expression and a low white-cell count, and 26 percent for those with myeloid-antigen expression and a high white-cell count (P less than 0.00001). CONCLUSIONS: Myeloid-antigen expression is an important independent predictor of a poor response to chemotherapy in childhood ALL.","['Wiersma, S R', 'Ortega, J', 'Sobel, E', 'Weinberg, K I']","['Wiersma SR', 'Ortega J', 'Sobel E', 'Weinberg KI']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Childrens Hospital Los Angeles.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,N Engl J Med,The New England journal of medicine,0255562,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antigens, CD/*analysis', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/analysis', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/*analysis', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Monocytes/immunology', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*immunology', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies']",1991/03/21 00:00,1991/03/21 00:01,['1991/03/21 00:00'],"['1991/03/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/03/21 00:01 [medline]', '1991/03/21 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1056/NEJM199103213241204 [doi]'],ppublish,N Engl J Med. 1991 Mar 21;324(12):800-8. doi: 10.1056/NEJM199103213241204.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",,,,,,['N Engl J Med. 1991 Nov 7;325(19):1378-82.

This new BCR/ABL fusion gene generates a unique 8.7 kilobase (kb) RNA which codes for a new 210 kilodalton (kd, p210) protein which has a protein tyrosine kinase activity that is greatly increased in comparison to the normal ABL protein. The human K562 cell line was derived from a patient with CML, and serves as one model for the regulation of expression of the ABL and BCR/ABL genes. This study examines the expression of the BCR/ABL fusion gene and the normal ABL gene in relation to differentiation and changes in proliferative state. The expression of both the normal ABL transcripts and the BCR/ABL fusion transcript decrease approximately ten-fold when the cells are induced to differentiate with hemin. In contrast, expression of the MYC oncogene is unaffected by hemin-induced differentiation.

We refer to this clonal expansion as preleukemia. Subsequent alterations, intrinsic or extrinsic, often referred to as transformation, result in abnormal differentiation and/or growth regulation; we refer to this as leukemia. Several issues are unresolved. Where in the hierarchy of hematopoiesis clonal expansion and transformation occur is unknown. It is quite likely that clonal expansion occurs in cells with considerable self-renewal potential--probably stem or progenitor cells. The precise site may vary in different cases and account for the diverse phenotypes of acute leukemia. How the preleukemia clone comes to dominate hematopoiesis and the fate of the residual normal stem cells and their progeny are also unknown. Likewise, there is controversy whether different models of leukemogenesis operate in different subjects. For example, are older persons or those with occupational exposure to potentially leukomogenic agents more likely to exhibit one pattern of leukomogenesis? Finally, it is unknown whether these diverse models of leukemogenesis respond differently to therapy.","['Butturini, A', 'Gale, R P']","['Butturini A', 'Gale RP']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Parma, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,IM,"['Acute Disease', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*pathology']",1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0145-2126(91)90137-I [pii]', '10.1016/0145-2126(91)90137-i [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1991;15(1):1-7. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(91)90137-i.,,44,,,['CA 38569/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,

We examined efflux multiplicity under conditions that do and do not maintain cellular ATP at the physiological level. In ATP-replete cells, the results delineate a probenecid-, bromosulfophthalein-, and verapamil-inhibitable route that accounts for nearly 90% of [3H]MTX efflux. Efflux of [3H]MTX by this route is inhibited by bromosulfophthalein in the trans orientation only, inhibited by probenecid only when present simultaneously in the cis and trans orientation and inhibited by verapamil only in the cis orientation. The remaining efflux of this folate analogue in ATP-replete cells appears to be mediated by the one-carbon, reduced folate system (MTX influx route), in that it is not inhibited by bromosulfophthalein or verapamil but is inhibited by the N-hydroxysuccinimide ester of MTX, a specific inhibitor of MTX influx, and a 10-fold higher concentration of probenecid than that required to inhibit ATP-dependent efflux. Under these conditions, MTX did not trans-stimulate [3H]MTX efflux. Also, no evidence was obtained for a putative bromosulfophthalein-insensitive, probenecid-inhibitable route for [3H]MTX efflux. In cells depleted to the extent of 90-95% of their ATP by 60-min incubation in medium in the absence of D-glucose and with 10 mM sodium azide, overall efflux of [3H]MTX was markedly reduced and appears to be mediated solely by the MTX influx route. Influx of [3H]MTX was both cis and trans inhibited by probenecid, and efflux under these conditions was markedly inhibited by the N-hydroxysuccinimide ester of MTX and trans-stimulated by MTX. Overall, the results of these studies are consistent with a model for methotrexate transport in L1210 cells derived [Dembo et al., J. Membrane Biol., 78: 9-17, 1984] in the authors' laboratory based solely upon a kinetic analysis of [3H]MTX influx and efflux in ATP-replete and depleted L1210 cells. As such, these new results identify a single ATP-dependent efflux route as the bromosulfophthalein-, probenecid-, and verapamil-inhibitable route in L1210 cells under conditions that maintain ATP levels at maximum.","['Sirotnak, F M', ""O'Leary, D F""]","['Sirotnak FM', ""O'Leary DF""]","['Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York 10021.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Biological Transport/drug effects', '*Energy Metabolism', 'Leukemia L1210/*metabolism', 'Methotrexate/*pharmacokinetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Probenecid/pharmacology', 'Sulfobromophthalein/pharmacology', 'Verapamil/pharmacology']",1991/03/01 00:00,1991/03/01 00:01,['1991/03/01 00:00'],"['1991/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1991 Mar 1;51(5):1412-7.,"['0C2P5QKL36 (Sulfobromophthalein)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)', 'PO572Z7917 (Probenecid)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",,,,"['CA 08748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 46673/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

This increased activity may in part be responsible for the hypersialylation observed in leukemic leukocytes; however, hypersialylation may also be due to changes in underlying O-glycan structures. To test this hypothesis, we have assayed in normal human granulocytes and leukemic leukocytes several glycosyltransferases involved in the synthesis and elongation of the four common O-glycan cores. UDP-GlcNAc:Gal beta 1-3GalNAc-R (GlcNAc to GalNAc) beta(1-6)-GlcNAc transferase (EC 2.4.1.102), which synthesizes O-glycan core 2 (GlcNAc beta 1-6[Gal beta 1-3]GalNAc alpha), is significantly elevated in chronic myelogenous leukemia (4-fold) and AML (18-fold) leukocytes relative to normal human granulocytes.

The beta 3-GlcNAc transferase which elongates core 1 and core 2 was found at low levels in normal granulocytes but was not detectable in leukemic cells. The beta 3-GlcNAc transferase and beta 4-Gal transferase involved in poly-N-acetyllactosamine synthesis, as well as the beta 3-Gal transferase synthesizing core 1 (Gal beta 3 GalNAc), were present in all samples but were significantly increased in patients with AML.

This study was designed to determine the effects of acivicin on the levels of HL-60 cell mRNA transcripts of several cytokines, growth factors, and protooncogenes implicated in the control of hematopoietic cell proliferation and differentiation. Control HL-60 cells did not express mRNA for granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor, granulocyte-macrophage-colony-stimulating factor, interleukin 3, or interleukin 6, and acivicin or phorbol myristate acetate did not induce their expression. Phorbol myristate acetate reduced expression of c-myc, c-myb, and heat shock protein 70 and enhanced those of macrophage-colony-stimulating factor and c-fms. Acivicin caused a decreased expression of c-myc, and an increased expression of mRNA for interleukin 1 beta and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha). The drug also caused an initial increase in c-myb, followed by a subsequent decrease below baseline levels. Supernatants and lysates of acivicin-treated HL-60 cells contained increased levels of interleukin 1 beta. Both TNF-alpha and interleukin 1 beta have been shown previously to influence hematopoietic cell differentiation. In our experiments, exogenous interleukin 1 added to HL-60 cells did not induce differentiation, but the combination of interleukin 1 and TNF synergistically enhanced the process. Pretreatment of the cells with TNF enhanced their responsiveness to subsequent treatment with interleukin 1. Our results demonstrate that the glutamine antagonist acivicin modulates HL-60 cell expression of TNF-alpha, interleukin 1 beta, c-myc, and c-myb and suggest that interleukin 1 beta and TNF-alpha might (in an autocrine manner) cause the differentiation.","['Weinberg, J B', 'Mason, S N']","['Weinberg JB', 'Mason SN']","['VA Medical Center, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Durham, North Carolina 27705.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Cytokines/biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Genes, myc/drug effects', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/biosynthesis', 'Heat-Shock Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1/biosynthesis', 'Interleukin-3/biosynthesis', 'Interleukin-6/biosynthesis', 'Isoxazoles/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy', 'Monocytes/*drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb', 'Proto-Oncogenes/*drug effects', 'RNA, Messenger/*drug effects', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Transcription, Genetic/*drug effects', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology']",1991/02/15 00:00,1991/02/15 00:01,['1991/02/15 00:00'],"['1991/02/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/02/15 00:01 [medline]', '1991/02/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1991 Feb 15;51(4):1202-9.,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Isoxazoles)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'O0X60K76I6 (acivicin)']",,"['c-fms', 'c-myb', 'c-myc']",,"['P01 32682/PHS HHS/United States', 'P01 AI23308/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 AR39162/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

The data illustrate the differences in the sensitivity of S-phase cells in myelogenous versus lymphocytic leukemic lines to both DNA topoisomerase I and II inhibitors and emphasize the tissue (leukemia type)-specific factors that modulate the cytostatic and cytotoxic effects of these inhibitors. The qualitatively different response of HL-60 cells to camptothecin, teniposide, or amsacrine (by rapidly triggered DNA degradation in S phase) as compared to mitoxantrone or adriamycin (by cell arrest in G2 and S) suggests that, despite the generally assumed common mode of action attributed to these drugs (i.e., via stabilization of the cleavable DNA-topoisomerase complexes), there are significant differences in the mechanisms by which they exert cytostatic/cytotoxic effects.","['Del Bino, G', 'Darzynkiewicz, Z']","['Del Bino G', 'Darzynkiewicz Z']","['Cancer Research Institute, New York Medical College, Valhalla 10595.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Amsacrine/*pharmacology', 'Camptothecin/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'DNA/*drug effects', 'Doxorubicin/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy', 'Mitoxantrone/*pharmacology', 'S Phase/drug effects', 'Teniposide/*pharmacology']",1991/02/15 00:00,1991/02/15 00:01,['1991/02/15 00:00'],"['1991/02/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/02/15 00:01 [medline]', '1991/02/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1991 Feb 15;51(4):1165-9.,"['00DPD30SOY (Amsacrine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', '957E6438QA (Teniposide)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'XT3Z54Z28A (Camptothecin)']",,,,"['R01 CA28704/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA23296/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Seventeen patients with a diagnosis of PLL or CLL-Pro received fludarabine 30 mg/m2 over 30 minutes daily for 5 days every 4 weeks alone (12 patients), or with prednisone (five patients). Previously defined criteria for response were used. Differences in response rates according to various characteristics were evaluated by chi-square test. RESULTS: Three patients (18%) achieved complete remission, and three (18%) had a partial remission, for an overall response rate of 35%. Responses were durable and occurred in all involved organ sites. Lower response rates were observed in patients with anemia, thrombocytopenia, advanced Rai stages, and primary resistance to prior therapy. Toxicities were minimal except for febrile episodes associated with therapy. CONCLUSION: Fludarabine has shown encouraging results in these patients and deserves further investigation in combination with other active agents, and in the setting of front-line therapy.","['Kantarjian, H M', 'Childs, C', ""O'Brien, S"", 'Huh, Y', 'Beran, M', 'Schachner, J', 'Koller, C', 'Keating, M J']","['Kantarjian HM', 'Childs C', ""O'Brien S"", 'Huh Y', 'Beran M', 'Schachner J', 'Koller C', 'Keating MJ']","['Department of Hematology, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Controlled Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Med,The American journal of medicine,0267200,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Agranulocytosis/etiology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Chromosome Aberrations/genetics', 'Chromosome Disorders', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin M/analysis', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Prolymphocytic/*drug therapy/genetics/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prednisone/therapeutic use', 'Remission Induction', 'Vidarabine/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use']",1991/02/01 00:00,1991/02/01 00:01,['1991/02/01 00:00'],"['1991/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['0002-9343(91)80164-H [pii]'],ppublish,Am J Med. 1991 Feb;90(2):223-8.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, the authors used flow cytometry (FCM) to analyze TdT expression in human hematopoietic malignancies. Cells were fixed in 0.5% formaldehyde, briefly exposed to nonionic detergent, and subsequently labeled with mouse monoclonal anti-TdT antibodies followed by fluorescein-conjugated antimouse IgG and propidium iodide (PI), which was used for the simultaneous analysis of DNA content. Cells from 20 of 22 acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALL), 4 of 7 mixed lineage leukemias, 2 of 21 acute myeloid and myelomonocytic leukemias, 1 of 2 chronic myeloid leukemias in blast crisis, 1 lymphoblastic lymphoma, and 1 thymoma were TdT positive. Cells from 13 nonlymphoblastic lymphomas, 3 myelodysplastic bone marrows, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 29 normal individuals were negative. An excellent correlation was seen between this assay, the conventional slide immunofluorescence technique, and an enzyme immunoassay method. The FCM assay detected as few as 2% blasts in mixing experiments of TdT-containing leukemic cells with normal peripheral lymphocytes. Furthermore, the combined analysis of TdT and DNA allowed the recognition of aneuploid TdT positive cells in four cases of ALL. The high sensitivity, the quantitative information obtained, and the capability of simultaneously analyzing DNA content make this method of TdT analysis more valuable than conventional techniques.","['Almasri, N M', 'Iturraspe, J A', 'Benson, N A', 'Chen, M G', 'Braylan, R C']","['Almasri NM', 'Iturraspe JA', 'Benson NA', 'Chen MG', 'Braylan RC']","['Department of Pathology, University of Florida College of Medicine, Gainesville 32610-0275.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Am J Clin Pathol,American journal of clinical pathology,0370470,IM,"['DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase/*metabolism', '*Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Hematologic Diseases/*enzymology', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Leukemia/*enzymology', 'Neoplasms/enzymology', 'Ploidies', 'Propidium', 'Reference Values', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",1991/03/01 00:00,1991/03/01 00:01,['1991/03/01 00:00'],"['1991/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/ajcp/95.3.376 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Clin Pathol. 1991 Mar;95(3):376-80. doi: 10.1093/ajcp/95.3.376.,"['36015-30-2 (Propidium)', 'EC 2.7.7.31 (DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
