When compared to the parent line HL-60, HL-60-R showed greater relative resistance to vinblastine than to etoposide, or to the selecting agent DOX. Co-exposure to verapamil, a known modulator of MDR, partially increased its sensitivity to DOX and vinblastine. The HL-60-R cell line stained positively with the P-glycoprotein-specific monoclonal antibody (MAb), C219, whereas the HL-60 parent was negative. Southern analysis showed 32-fold amplification of the mdrI gene in HL-60-R, whereas slot-blot analysis demonstrated 70-fold over-expression of the specific mdrI message in HL-60-R compared to HL-60. Northern blot analysis revealed the presence of 2 species of messenger RNA of sizes 5.1 kb and 4.5 kb. No transcripts were detectable in the parent. Flow cytometric analysis showed significantly reduced cellular retention of DOX as well as rapid efflux from the drug-resistant cell line. HL-60-R proved to be nearly 4 times more resistant to hydrogen peroxide than its parent, and 1,000 times more resistant to inhibition of cellular glutathione synthesis by D,L-buthionine sulfoximine (BSO). Verapamil modulated DOX resistance in HL-60-R incompletely but, in the presence of glutathione depletion, nearly completely reversed DOX resistance. Elevated levels of glutathione and glutathione-peroxidase activity were demonstrated, thereby implicating enhanced activity of the glutathione/glutathione-peroxidase cycle as an additional basis for its resistance to DOX. These findings suggest that an enhanced capacity for detoxifying oxyradicals may contribute to anthracycline resistance in acute leukemia.",['mdr1'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Leukemia cells from ATL patients generally expressed low levels of GD2 but the percentage of GD2+ cells increased up to 40-70% after in vitro culture in the presence of interleukin 2 for about a week. No other type of leukemia cells and normal peripheral T cells expressed GD2 during in vitro culture under the same conditions. The appearance of GD2 in the cultured ATL cells corresponded with the expression of p40tax, a product of the HTLV-I gene. Peripheral lymphocytes infected with a p40tax-expressing retroviral vector expressed high levels of GD2 in comparison with control lymphocytes containing the neomycin-resistance gene alone. The apparently increased levels of beta-1,4-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase (GM2/GD2 synthase) mRNA in these cells were demonstrated by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis. Concordance between mRNA expression for the HTLV-I tax1/rex1 genes and the beta-1,4-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase gene was also observed in uncultured ATL cells. These results suggest that high GD2 expression was due to neosynthesis from precursor GD3 by increased expression of this enzyme induced by p40tax in vitro and in vivo.",,PMC46002,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nevertheless, it belongs to the class of compounds that show impaired retention in multidrug-resistant cells expressing P-glycoprotein (Pgp), a drug efflux pump. Chemosensitizers like verapamil modulate multidrug resistance by interfering with the efflux action of Pgp and thus can decrease drug resistance or can restore drug sensitivity by restoring normal drug accumulation and distribution within the multidrug-resistant tumor cell. The two strongest, nearly equipotent chemosensitizers identified to date are the cyclosporine derivative SDZ PSC 833 and the semisynthetic cyclopeptolide SDZ 280-446. PURPOSE: This study was designed to investigate the capacities of verapamil, SDZ PSC 833, and SDZ 280-446 to decrease resistance of two multidrug-resistant cell lines to taxol. METHODS: We studied in vitro the growth of two multidrug-resistant tumor cell lines displaying high resistance to taxol: multidrug-resistant Chinese hamster ovary cells and murine monocytic leukemia P388 cells. We determined the taxol concentration that produced 50% inhibition of cell growth (IC50) in the two multidrug-resistant cell lines and in the parent cell lines, in the presence of a range of chemosensitizer concentrations (0-30 microM). IC50 values were determined in the presence and in the absence of verapamil, SDZ PSC 833, or SDZ 280-446. RESULTS: At nontoxic concentrations (0.3-1 microM), SDZ PSC 833 and SDZ 280-446 produced an almost complete reversal of the high taxol resistance of the multidrug-resistant tumor cells, whereas only partial restoration of sensitivity to taxol was achieved with verapamil. CONCLUSION: SDZ PSC 833 and SDZ 280-446 can restore the normal taxol sensitivity of highly resistant multidrug-resistant tumor cells. IMPLICATIONS: The combination of taxol with SDZ PSC 833 or SDZ 280-446 may be recommended for treatment of multidrug-resistant cancers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cell culture studies demonstrate that noradrenergic neurons can be induced to become cholinergic and that the expression of neuropeptides can be altered. Similar changes in transmitter phenotype occur in vivo. During development, noradrenergic neurons that innervate eccrine sweat glands acquire cholinergic and peptidergic function. This change is dependent upon interactions with the target tissue. Following injury of sympathetic neurons in developing and adult animals, striking alterations take place in peptide expression. Ciliary neurotrophic factor and cholinergic differentiation factor/leukemia inhibitory factor, members of a family that includes several hematopoietic cytokines, induce cholinergic function and modulate neuropeptide expression in cultured sympathetic neurons. Studies in progress provide evidence that members of this new cytokine family influence the transmitter phenotype of sympathetic neurons not only in vitro but also in vivo.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Animals were inoculated with Dup MuLV (SC1/Dup MuLV confluent fibroblast supernatant or spleen extract from an infected mouse). Peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets were sequentially monitored for 73 days using flow cytometric analysis and MoAbs directly conjugated to fluorochromes. A striking fall in the Thy1.2+ cell count occurred in diseased animals, mostly affecting the CD8+ cell compartment. At the same time, the percentage of Ly5+ cells was increased. Mice were killed at day 73 and spleen and lymph node lymphocytes were analysed. Phenotypic lymphocyte modifications in peripheral blood were closely related to those in the spleen or lymph nodes. Analysis of Ly6c antigen expression on CD4+ and CD8+ cells showed a selective expansion of the CD8+Ly6c+ subset, which may reflect a state of immune activation. Our results suggest that phenotypic alterations of peripheral blood lymphocytes are a good marker of disease progression in this model and could be a useful criterion to evaluate antiretroviral therapy.",,PMC1554708,,,,,,,,,,,,

CD4+ lymphocytes, at both polyclonal and clonal level, recognized peptide BCR1/25 in an HLA-DR--restricted fashion on presentation by autologous antigen-presenting cell (APC) or by APC expressing the HLA-DR11 restricting molecule.

The autologous DE LCL containing a transduced pml/RAR alpha fusion gene and expressing a bcr1 type of the pml/RAR alpha hybrid protein induced the proliferation of DE anti-BCR1/25 T cell clones.

This BsAb reacted with both CD3+ T cells and CD13+ acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells. We investigated whether cytokine-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) could lyse patient AML cells after addition of the BsAb. When interleukin-2 (IL-2)-stimulated PBMC were assayed for their cytotoxicity against 51Cr-labeled allogeneic and autologous CD13+ AML cells, their activity was markedly enhanced by the addition of the BsAb. PBMC stimulated with IL-2 plus anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody (MoAb) showed higher proliferative ability and higher cytotoxicity if this was expressed as lytic units per culture. IL-7-stimulated PBMC also exhibited enhanced cytotoxicity against CD13+ AML cells after addition of the BsAb. Ultrastructurally, CD13+ AML cells incubated with IL-2 plus anti-CD3 MoAb-stimulated PBMC and the BsAb showed apoptotic morphologic changes. A colony assay for AML blast progenitors showed that the colony formation of CD13+ AML cells was inhibited by the addition of autologous IL-2 plus anti-CD3 MoAb-stimulated PBMC, and that this inhibition was further enhanced by the addition of the BsAb. A colony assay for normal bone marrow progenitor cells showed that the addition of autologous IL-2 plus anti-CD3 MoAb-stimulated PBMC and the BsAb inhibited the formation of granulocyte-macrophage colonies and mixed-cell colonies. However, the degree of inhibition was smaller than that for the AML blast colonies. Taken together, these findings suggest that this BsAb may be useful for ex vivo purging of CD13+ AML cells in autologous bone marrow transplantation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this paper, we show that this kinase phosphorylates both eIF-2 alpha and a synthetic peptide based on the phosphorylation site in eIF-2 alpha at Ser51, the target residue for other eIF-2 alpha kinases. Consistent with this, prior treatment of eIF-2 with MKu impaired the exchange of bound GDP for GTP which is catalysed by the exchange factor eIF-2B. Using a modified cell-free translation system, we have shown that MKu inhibits translation, consistent with the above observations concerning the site of phosphorylation and the effect of phosphorylation on eIF-2B-mediated guanine-nucleotide exchange. MKu has been purified and its properties have been compared with those of the haem-controlled repressor eIF-2 alpha kinase (HCR) from rabbit reticulocytes. Its behaviour on gel filtration is similar to that of HCR, while its behaviour on anion exchange resembles that of certain phosphorylated species of HCR. Highly purified preparations of MKu contain a protein with an apparent molecular mass of 98 kDa which comigrates with HCR on SDS/PAGE. This protein undergoes phosphorylation when incubated in the presence of Mg(2+)-ATP, and both this apparent autophosphorylation and the activity of the kinase against eIF-2 alpha are inhibited by the same, low, (10 microM) concentrations of haemin. Phosphorylation of the 98-kDa components present in the MEL-cell kinase preparation and in purified rabbit reticulocyte HCR occurs on serine and threonine residues. Analysis of these phosphoproteins by peptide mapping reveals significant differences in their structures, indicating that they may be closely related, but are certainly not identical.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Terfenadine sensitized MCF-7/ADR human breast cancer cells and L1210/VMDRC.06 murine leukemia cells to doxorubicin. At concentrations < or = 10 microM, terfenadine decreased the IC50 to doxorubicin by up to 25-fold against MCF-7/ADR cells and completely restored sensitivity to L1210/VMDRC.06 cells. The drug had no effect on the sensitive, parental cell lines and enhanced activity of other drugs affected by the MDR phenotype. Terfenadine was as potent as trans-flupenthixol, one of the most active modulators of MDR. The mechanism of action of terfenadine appeared to be due to inhibition of the function of P-glycoprotein since it augmented the accumulation of doxorubicin and inhibited the efflux of rhodamine 123 from MDR lines but had no effect on drug accumulation or efflux in sensitive cells. Terfenadine displaced azidopine from P-glycoprotein, but at concentrations higher than expected based on its overall potency. Since terfenadine is clinically available, has numerous structural derivatives available for study, and has a relatively low toxicity profile, this drug and drugs of its class should be evaluated for future clinical trials.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Due to allergic reactions in phase I and early phase II studies, use of a 24-hour infusion of taxol with prophylactic dexamethasone, diphenhydramine, and cimetidine has been recommended. PURPOSE: In this phase II study, we attempted to determine the efficacy and toxicity of taxol in patients with advanced (stage IIIB or IV) non-small-cell lung cancer who had never received chemotherapy. METHODS: Patients were not excluded because of prior surgery or because of radiotherapy administered more than 4 weeks before study entry. Taxol was administered in the hospital at a dose of 200 mg/m2 as an intravenous infusion over 24 hours and repeated every 3 weeks, provided that patients had recovered from any toxic effects. Dexamethasone, cimetidine, and diphenhydramine were given before chemotherapy to prevent hypersensitivity reactions. Therapy was continued for at least two courses unless there was rapid disease progression and for at least three courses if no change was observed and no grade 3 or 4 toxic effects occurred. Treatment was continued for six more courses after maximum response or for two more courses after complete remission but was discontinued if disease progressed. RESULTS: Of the 27 patients entered in the study, 25 were assessable for toxic effects and response. One patient had an allergic reaction that was not life threatening. The overall response rate was 24% (one complete response and five partial responses). An additional seven patients (28%) had minor response. Granulocytopenia was the dose-limiting toxic effect, and neutropenic fever occurred in eight of 118 courses. One additional patient developed neutropenic sepsis with hypotension but recovered with intensive treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Taxol appears to have activity against non-small-cell carcinoma of the lung. IMPLICATIONS: A phase II study combining taxol, etoposide, and cisplatin and using hematopoietic stimulating factors is now proposed. The optimal dose for combination chemotherapy has yet to be determined. An important consideration is potential cardiac effects of taxol with other drugs.",,,,['J Natl Cancer Inst. 1993 Mar 3;85(5):346-7. PMID: 8094465'],,,,,,,,,,

The substitution of an acetyl or an ethoxycarbonyl group for the amine N-ethoxycarbonyl-7-oxostaurosporine moiety on the tetrahydropyran ring of staurosporine decreased inhibition of both protein kinases, but increased selectivity for C-kinase by further modification of the lactam moiety to the imide (NA-382). The activities of SF-2370 on protein kinases were decreased by decarboxylation and hydroxyalkylation. These staurosporine derivatives enhanced accumulation of vinblastine in adriamycin-resistant P388 (P388/ADR) cells in a dose-dependent manner. The potency for the drug accumulation of these compounds was correlated with their inhibitory activity on the drug efflux, but was not correlated with their activity on protein kinases. Staurosporine and NA-382, with high potency for vinblastine accumulation, inhibited the photolabelling of [3H]azidopine on 140 kDa P-glycoprotein in the plasma membrane. The tetrahydrofuran compounds and NA-357, which had low potency for the drug accumulation, hardly interacted with azidopine on P-glycoprotein. Most of these compounds were highly cytotoxic by themselves, and only NA-382 was less cytotoxic among them and completely reversed the vinblastine-resistance of P388/ADR cells at a non-cytotoxic concentration. These results suggest that staurosporine derivatives can enhance drug accumulation and inhibit drug resistance through their direct action on the P-glycoprotein.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our study shows that this process is initiated by very low UV doses: exposure to one minimal erythema dose (MED, about 200 J/m2), at defined wavelengths ranging from 270 to 330 nm, is sufficient. By sequencing 100 randomly selected blunt-end chromatin fragments (single and multiple nucleosomes) we observed that at an early stage of apoptosis the fragmented DNA contains a four-fold excess of both long and short interspersed nuclear retroelements (LINEs and SINEs). A distinct sequence finding was also the observation that fragmented DNA is very rich in microsatellites, (CA)n dinucleotides in particular, and in long stretches of homopurine/homopyrimidine domains. The present results thus indicate that chromatin fragmentation in UV-induced apoptosis begins at non-random locations involving non-B DNA conformation, and that the onset of the suicide process in chloroleukaemia cells is surprisingly sensitive to UV exposure.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The cytotoxic activity of 2-CdA requires the intracellular accumulation of 2-CdA nucleotides. Deoxycytidine kinase (dCK) and cytoplasmic 5'-nucleotidase (5'-NT) are the principal enzymes that phosphorylate 2-CdA and dephosphorylate 2-CdA 5'-monophosphate, respectively. The net accumulation of 2-CdA nucleotides may therefore depend on both dCK and 5'-NT. The purpose of the present experiments was to determine if there is a relationship between pretreatment levels of dCK and 5'-NT in HCL and in CLL cells, and the clinical outcome of 2-CdA treatment. As measured by a direct immunoassay for dCK in 25 CLL patients, and by a 5'-NT activity assay in 23 patients, mean dCK levels were significantly higher in 2-CdA responders than in nonresponders (P < .01), whereas mean 5'-NT levels were significantly lower in 2-CdA responders than in nonresponders (P < .05). Mean dCK levels were higher in six HCL 2-CdA responders than in one nonresponder, whereas mean 5'-NT levels were lower in the 2-CdA responders than in the nonresponder. These results suggest that both dCK and 5'-NT are determinants of 2-CdA responsiveness.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The profile of the patient population was as follows: low grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) = 8, intermediate grade NHL = 2, transformed (intermediate grade NHL) = 6, Hodgkin's disease = 1, lymphoplasmacytoid NHL = 3 and lymphoblastic NHL = 1. The overall response rate was 53%, with three patients attaining complete remission (CR) and eight partial remission (PR). Three of 16 patients with primary resistant or resistant recurrent disease entered either CR (1) or PR (2). Ten patients had no response or progressive disease. The latter group was comprised of patients who had extensively pre-treated lymphoplasmacytoid tumours and/or poor performance status (WHO grades 2-4). The median duration of response is 6 months (range 1 to 12 months). Treatment was well tolerated and the chief toxicities were leucopenia and thrombocytopenia which were most pronounced when there was bone marrow involvement. As a result of dose limiting myelotoxicity, a dose escalation to 0.15 mg/kg/day was possible on just three occasions.

We have therefore adapted the PCR for quantitative assessment of bcr/abl rearranged cells and applied this technique to the monitoring of residual disease in 28 CML patients during up to 106 months of follow-up after BMT. In 5 patients, quantitative PCR revealed increasing amounts of the pathological bcr/abl message, indicating the presence of a proliferating neoplastic clone, and all 5 had a subsequent relapse of disease. By contrast, the remaining 23 patients have been in maintenance-free complete remission for up to 106 months post-BMT.

Studies with these methods in acute myeloid leukaemia suggest that a significant proportion of cases have clonal remissions (ie, persistence of the malignant clone), which may represent return to a preleukaemic state. We therefore analysed X-chromosome inactivation patterns with differential methylation patterns of heterozygotes for three DNA probes, HPRT, PGK, and M27 beta, in leukaemic patients and normal controls. As expected, blast cells from 67 of 68 analysable samples (99%) were monoclonal or had a skewed X-inactivation pattern. A skewed pattern in remission was also found in 26 of 77 patients (34%), proportion only slightly greater than control (16/75, 21%). In 7 of 10 patients with a skewed pattern in myeloid cells there was similar skewing in the T cells, which is compatible with the concept of a constitutively skewed X-chromosome inactivation pattern of haemopoietic cells in these patients. Our study illustrates the difficulty of interpreting clonality in individual tumour samples and emphasises the importance of comparisons with non-malignant tissue of the same cell type from that individual and from normal control populations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have investigated the possible effect which the EBV genes LMP1 and EBNA2, of which the expression has been reported in non-B cell neoplasms, may have on a variety of cell types. The LMP1 and EBNA2 genes were transiently expressed from heterologous promoters in two human T-cell lines (HPB-ALL and Jurkat), two human cell lines of the myeloid lineage (K562 and U937), one type I Burkitt's lymphoma cell line (Rael) and in human primary T cells and B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells. The cell surface expression of CD23, CD21, ICAM-1 and LFA-1 was monitored on transfected cells. In the cell lines, except U937, the surface antigens CD21 and ICAM-1 were upregulated in a dose-dependent and transient manner by the transient expression of LMP1, and EBNA2 slightly enhanced the effects of LMP1 on CD23 and CD21 upregulation. LMP1 also induced increased CD21, ICAM-1 and LFA-1 surface expression on transfected primary T-cells, and CD21 and ICAM-1 in four of five B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemias tested. Finally, LMP1 transient expression caused increased cell size of the primary T cells and responding B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells. Our results strongly suggest that LMP1 can trigger specific responses in a variety of white cell types and thus is probably contributing to the phenotype of EBV-positive tumor cells not only in the B-cell lineage.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

LTD4 is necessary for normal myeloid proliferation and differentiation. We have examined the ability of hematopoietic growth factors (HGF) to induce GGT enzyme activity and mRNA content in a HGF-responsive cell line (KG-1). Incubation of KG-1 with recombinant human cytokines interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), interleukin-3 (IL-3), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF), but not interleukin-6 (IL-6), granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) or monocyte colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), results in significant increases in GGT enzyme activity. The increases in GGT activity are both dose- and time-dependent. In response to IL-1, increases in enzyme activity are seen by 6 hours and activity is maximal by 24 hours. GGT mRNA increases also occur and peak by 3 to 6 hours. These results indicate that induction of increases in GGT mRNA levels and enzyme activity occur in myeloid cells in response to HGFs. This induction, together with the requirement for LTD4 for normal granulopoiesis, supports a role for GGT in the cellular events occurring in myeloid cells in response to HGFs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study we have examined whether the presence of high levels of HB24 alters the tumorigenicity of Jurkat cells in nude mice. Subcutaneous injection of 1-2 x 10(6) Jurkat cells or Jurkat cells transfected with a control expression vector into nude mice failed to produce tumors. However, injection of a similar number of HB24-transfected Jurkat cells resulted in local tumor formation within 4 weeks and grossly apparent metastatic lesions within 8 weeks. Histopathological analysis of tissues from the local and metastatic lesions demonstrated predominantly lymphoid cells, consistent with the morphological appearance of the injected cell line. Freshly isolated tumor cells from the nude mice incorporated similar levels of [3H]thymidine as the HB24-transfected Jurkat cells and 2-fold more than the parent Jurkat cells. Northern blot analysis of RNA prepared from the tumors revealed expression of human interleukin 2, interleukin 2 receptor alpha-chain, HB24, and CD4. Flow cytometric analysis of the tumor cells revealed human CD4 expression but not murine CD4, confirming the human origin of the tumor cells. Media conditioned by the tumor cells contained large amounts of interleukin 2. Since natural killer cell activity is the primary immunological response against tumors in nude mice, the effects of HB24 on the responsiveness to natural killer cell-mediated cell lysis was examined. No differences in natural killer cell killing of the parent Jurkat cells and the HB24-transfected cells were observed. These data, in conjunction with recent data implicating other homeobox-containing genes in the pathogenesis of human leukemias, suggest that overexpression of HB24 in hematopoietic progenitors or T-cells may contribute to oncogenic transformation.","['CD4', 'HB24', 'IL2', 'IL2R', 'c-fos', 'c-myc']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

In vitro exposure of leukemic lymphocytes to CldAdo or F-ara-A for 24 to 72 hours elicited features of apoptosis visible by light and electron microscopy. Analysis of DNA integrity showed DNA cleavage into nucleosomal-sized multimers. Using a quantitative assay, drug-induced DNA fragmentation was both time and dose dependent. Inhibition of active macromolecular synthesis did not prevent drug-induced fragmentation; however, both drug-induced and spontaneous DNA fragmentation were prevented by intracellular calcium chelation. In vitro culture with phorbol ester generally decreased drug-induced DNA cleavage. After prolonged incubation, CLL cells exhibited spontaneous cleavage; albeit, at significantly lower rates than drug-treated cells. Heterogeneity was observed for spontaneous and drug-induced DNA fragmentation and was significantly lower in B-leukemic cells obtained from patients with high-risk and refractory disease. We conclude that CldAdo and F-ara-A are potent inducers of apoptotic death in CLL and that this feature correlates with the disease status.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sialyl SSEA-1 was expressed only on natural killer (NK) cells, and was essentially absent on resting mature T and B cells among normal peripheral lymphocytes. On the other hand, the I-antigen was strongly expressed on virtually all mature B cells, moderately expressed on most mature T cells, but not expressed on NK cells in normal donors. Expression of the two antigens on normal T and B cells was reversible; in vitro stimulation of normal lymphocytes with concanavalin A (Con A) resulted in the loss of I-antigen and appearance of sialyl SSEA-1 on CD3+ T blasts, whereas stimulation with pokeweed mitogen led to loss of I-antigen expression and appearance of sialyl SSEA-1 antigen on CD19+ B blasts. Among lymphocytic leukemia cells, sialyl SSEA-1 was detected primarily on leukemia cells having immature properties such as most common acute lymphocytic leukemia (cALL) blasts, while the I-antigen was frequently expressed on malignant cells having relatively mature properties, such as those found in adult T-cell leukemia or chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and only occasionally on cALL blasts. Among normal peripheral lymphocytes, the sialyl SSEA-1+I-antigen- NK cells selectively underwent E-selectin (ELAM-1, endothelial-leukocyte adhesion molecule-1)-dependent adhesion to endothelial cells, while the I-antigen+sialyl SSEA-1- mature T and B cells did not, in line with the recent finding that sialyl SSEA-1 serves as a specific ligand for E-selectin. Con A blasts, which are sialyl SSEA-1+I-antigen-, also exhibited significant E-selectin-dependent adhesion to endothelial cells. These results indicate that expression of the sialyl SSEA-1 and I-antigens varies alternately depending on the differentiation/activation status of the lymphocytes, and that this at least partly regulates the behavior of lymphocytes at the vessel wall.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The cells were used in a bone marrow transplantation protocol to reconstitute the hematopoietic compartments of lethally irradiated recipients. After 3 to 8 months, reconstituted mice developed acute myeloid leukemias that expressed high levels of p85E2A-Pbx1 and were readily transmissible to immunocompetent mice.

Using recombinant protease and a truncated GAG polyprotein as substrate, we developed a Western blot assay for the evaluation of inhibitors of the enzyme. Two statine-based inhibitors of the enzyme, KH161 and KH164, were effective in blocking the replication of HIV-1 in acutely infected human T4 lymphoid cells, with potency approaching that of zidovudine (ZDV) when tested in parallel. In chronically infected cells, the production of infectious virus was inhibited by KH161 and KH164, while ZDV was ineffective. Both KH161 and KH164 were also active as antivirals against the replication of murine leukemia virus (MLV) in cultured mouse cells. In an animal model of a murine retroviral disease, KH164 was shown to inhibit in a dose-dependent manner the progression of the disease induced by Friend virus complex (a mixture of Friend MLV and spleen focus-forming virus). The results suggest that the progression of the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) may be impeded by inhibitors of HIV-1 protease.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have now evaluated the mechanism of the dissociation of GVL and GVHD observed in this model. We demonstrate that CD4+ T cells were required to produce severe, acute GVHD in the fully MHC-mismatched plus minor histocompatibility Ag-mismatched A/J-->B10 strain combination. The GVHD-producing activity of A/J CD4+ T cells administered without CD8+ T cells was inhibited by IL-2 treatment. In contrast, CD8+ T cells alone mediated the GVL effect observed in the EL4 leukemia/lymphoma model, and CD4+ cells did not contribute to this effect. This CD8-mediated GVL activity was not inhibited by IL-2 treatment. Because naive A/J CD8+ T cells administered without CD4+ T cells did not produce acute GVHD, we were unable to evaluate the effect of IL-2 in this model. However, when A/J donors were presensitized with B10 skin grafts, CD4-depleted A/J spleen cells were capable of causing acute GVHD in B10 recipients. This CD8-mediated GVHD was not inhibited by treatment with IL-2. However, IL-2 did partially inhibit the GVHD produced by nondepleted presensitized A/J spleen cells, probably due to selective inhibition of the function of presensitized A/J CD4+ T cells. The dissociation of GVHD and GVL against the EL4 leukemia/lymphoma in IL-2-treated mice can therefore be explained by selective inhibition by IL-2 of CD4 activity.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Compared to controls, K-562 cells treated with kifunensine, an inhibitor of Golgi mannosidase I, accumulate more high mannose-type asparagine-linked oligosaccharide, Man9GlcNAc2, and bind more concanavalin A, an oligomannosyl binding lectin. In addition, natural killer cell lysis of kifunensine-treated cells increases 34% over that of controls. Increased sensitivity to lysis occurs after treatment with other N-glycan processing inhibitors that promote accumulation of high mannose-type glycosides (deoxymannojirimycin and swainsonine). In addition, kifunensine-treated cells form more effector:target conjugates. Monoclonal antibodies to the adhesion molecule LFA-1 and its ligand ICAM-1 reduce lysis of control targets but are less effective in blocking lysis of kifunensine-treated cells. K-562 cells bind anti-ICAM-1 but not anti-LFA-1, and this binding does not change after kifunensine treatment. These data demonstrate conclusively a role for asparagine-linked oligosaccharides in the human natural killer cell:target interaction. The presence of high mannose-type glycans on K-562 cells correlates with increased binding of effectors and a greater susceptibility to lysis. These results support the idea that target cell N-glycosides influence the NK-target interaction mediated by adhesion molecules such as ICAM-1.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The lymphoma is usually of donor origin. We hypothesized that treatment with infusions of donor leukocytes, which contain cytotoxic T cells presensitized to EBV, might be an effective treatment. METHODS: We studied five patients in whom EBV-associated lymphoproliferative disorders developed after they received a T-cell-depleted allogeneic bone marrow transplant. Biopsy specimens were immunophenotyped, subjected to the polymerase chain reaction to determine the origin of the lymphoma (donor or host) and to detect the presence of EBV, and analyzed by Southern blotting for the presence of the clonal EBV genome and immunoglobulin-gene rearrangement. Patients were treated with infusions of unirradiated donor leukocytes at doses calculated to provide approximately 1.0 x 10(6) CD3+ T cells per kilogram of body weight. RESULTS: Histopathological examination of biopsy specimens from all five patients demonstrated monomorphic, malignant lymphomas of B-cell origin. Each of the four specimens that could be evaluated was of donor-cell origin. Evidence of clonality was found in two of the three samples adequate for study. EBV DNA was detected by the polymerase chain reaction in all five samples. In all five patients there were complete pathological or clinical responses. The responses were first documented histologically within 8 to 21 days after infusion. Clinical remissions were achieved within 14 to 30 days after the infusions and were sustained without further therapy in the three surviving patients for 10, 16, and 16 months. CONCLUSIONS: In a small number of patients, infusions of unirradiated donor leukocytes were an effective treatment for EBV-associated lymphoproliferative disease that arose after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation.",,,,"['N Engl J Med. 1994 Sep 8;331(10):679-80.

One of the cDNAs isolated contained an additional six nucleotides close to the N-terminus, lying in-frame and at a point corresponding to an intron/exon boundary in the human annexin II gene. As the two rat cDNAs were identical apart from the six nucleotide insert, it is likely that these represent alternatively spliced transcripts of a single gene, rather than the products of two separate genes. The six nucleotides encode serine-glutamine and therefore introduce an additional potential phosphorylation site into a region already containing one tyrosine and two serine phosphorylation sites.

These increases in fos and jun mRNA levels were associated with the activation of the AP-1 transcription factor after addition of ET-18-OCH3 to human leukaemic cells, as assessed by an enhanced binding activity of transcription factor AP-1 to its cognate DNA sequence as well as by stimulation of transcription from an AP-1 enhancer element.

Nine specimens of FSLL from eight patients were studied. The lymphomas in this study showed a true follicular pattern that was independent of tissue planes; the cytologic composition was identical to that seen in SLL. All six of the specimens (from five patients) for which paraffin tissue was available marked as B cell phenotype and were positive for bcl-2 protein. Polymerase chain reaction studies performed on deparaffinized tissue sections showed bcl-2 major breakpoint region rearrangements in four of five cases for which study tissue was available. Clinical information was available for all eight patients. All patients presented with lymph node disease, and three patients also had extranodal involvement at the time of presentation. Three of the patients had a relapse of disease after 33-95 months, and two of these patients died soon after relapse. Another two of the eight patients never responded to chemotherapy and died of their disease after 2 and 8 months, respectively. Two patients died of causes unrelated to their lymphoma and unrelated to any lymphoma therapy. Only one patient remains disease-free, after 65 months; this patient had a relapse at 44 months. The finding of bcl-2 rearrangements suggests that the pathogenesis of FSLL is more closely related to follicular small cleaved cell lymphoma than to classic SLL.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Other potentially confusing findings were one case each of spongiotic dermatitis and leukocytoclastic vasculitis. The neoplastic cells were often situated at the peripheries of nodules and ranged from those with nuclei that resembled small lymphocytes to others that resembled immunoblasts. Most had eccentrically placed nuclei and fan-shaped cytoplasm. Monotypic kappa-light chain was found in all five cases, accompanied by gamma-heavy chain in two cases, and mu-heavy chain in one. In situ hybridization detected only kappa-mRNA in the four cases that yielded technically satisfactory results. The neoplastic cells did not express the B-cell antigen CD20; T-cells formed the centers of many nodules. Inappropriate staining for CD43 was evident in the neoplastic cells of one case. Because of reports of immunocytomas complicating acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans, we stained sections with an antiserum to Borrelia burgdorferi, which did not detect that organism. In situ hybridization did not detect EBER-1 RNA of the Epstein-Barr virus, which can be present in immunocytomas in immunocompromised patients. One patient died of disease after failing chemotherapy; another is alive with disseminated disease, and three are in remission following excision of lesions alone in two patients and chemotherapy in one patient who had relapsed following both excision and radiation therapy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After transfection in complementing cells the spread of the vector was followed by X-gal staining. The fraction of stained cells increased for the first 10 days following transfection and was then stabilized to about 20% stained cells, thus defining two cell types; one with LacZ+ phenotype and one with LacZ- phenotype.

This effect is mediated by a highly structured cis-acting RNA element of 254 nucleotides termed the Rex response element, or RexRE. Here we demonstrate that one of the four known RexRE stem-loop structures as well as a 43-nt segment derived from this element is sufficient to mediate Rex function in vivo. Upon duplication, this stem-loop is shown to function as efficiently as the full-length RexRE. In vitro RNA binding analyses with wildtype and mutagenized RNA show that this stem-loop contains a high affinity binding site for Rex that coincides with a predicted bulge structure in the central part of this stem-loop. These results indicate that a small region of the RexRE containing a high affinity binding site is sufficient to mediate Rex function and suggest that sequences outside of this binding site have no unique role in mediating Rex regulation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patient discharge data from all Greek hospitals treating childhood leukemia were used to calculate the annual incidence of the disease from January 1980 to June 1986 (preaccident period), from July 1986 to June 1988 (immediate postaccident period) and from July 1988 to June 1991 (""relevant"" post-accident period, that accommodates the presumed latent period of the disease). Fallout radiation measurements (in Bq/kg Cs-137) were used to create 17 regions of similar (within regions) but highly variable (between regions) levels of fallout deposition. Background radiation (in Bq/kg Ra-226) and annual incidence of childhood leukemia by region were also estimated. There was no evidence of increased incidence of childhood leukemia during the immediate or the ""relevant"" post-Chernobyl period in any part of the country.

Pulmonary findings at autopsy comprised pneumonia (n = 25), adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (n = 16), hemorrhage (n = 38), infarction (n = 18), and leukemic cellular infiltration (n = 11). Four radiologists who were unaware of the autopsy diagnoses independently rated antemortem bedside chest radiographs. RESULTS: Diagnostic accuracy for each disease was as follows: ARDS, 0.81 +/- .03 (standard error); all pneumonias, 0.56 +/- .04; hemorrhage, 0.47 +/- .07; infarction, 0.50 +/- .12; and pulmonary leukemic cellular infiltration, 0.38 +/- .12.

Translocations copurified with B lymphocytes. The frequency of translocations significantly increased with age in PBLs and spleens, as does human risk for lymphoma. Average translocation frequency was more than 40 times greater in the spleen and 13 times greater in the peripheral blood in the oldest individuals (61 yr and older) compared with the youngest individuals (20 yr or younger). Particular t(14;18)-bearing clones persisted over a period of 5 months in two individuals. These findings demonstrate that clones harboring the oncogenic t(14;18) chromosomal translocation are commonly present in normal humans, that such clones are long-lived, and that they rise in frequency with age.

A single dose of cyclophosphamide (100-400 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) produced a significant dose-dependent increase in urinary bladder weight within 48 hr of treatment. Disulfiram prevented cyclophosphamide-induced bladder damage in a dose-dependent manner in mice when orally administered simultaneously with antitumour agents, but failed to diminish the acute toxicity, leukocytotoxicity and immunotoxicity of cyclophosphamide. The protective effect of disulfiram on the bladder was critically dependent on administration timing. Oral administration of disulfiram between 60 min. before and 60 min. after the injection of cyclophosphamide was found to be effective. The optimum time was simultaneous administration of both drugs. Diethyldithiocarbamate and carbon disulfide, metabolites of disulfiram, prevented cyclophosphamide-induced bladder damage when administered simultaneously with cyclophosphamide 1 to, 3 or 5 hr afterwards. Disulfiram slightly potentiated the antitumour activity of cyclophosphamide against Sarcoma 180 or EL-4 leukaemia in vivo when administered simultaneously with cyclophosphamide. In contrast, diethyldithiocarbamate or carbon disulfide did not interfere with cyclophosphamide antitumour activity when administered 3 hr after cyclophosphamide. From these preliminary studies, disulfiram appears to be a likely candidate for protection against cyclophosphamide-induced urotoxicity without compromising the therapeutic utility of the alkylating agent.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Their clinical profiles (age, prognosis, modalities of treatment) and findings of radio-imaging were analyzed. All specimens from surgery and/or autopsy were histologically classified according to the working formulation (WF) classification of the National Cancer Institute. Ontogeny of lymphoma cells was determined by immunohistochemical study in all cases and some cases were subjected to light (kappa, lambda) and heavy chain (IgG, IgA, IgM) analysis as well. Among 21 cases, 12 cases were located in the cerebral hemisphere, 7 in the thalamus-basal ganglia and 4 in the cerebellum. Radio-imaging study showed that 18 cases (86%) revealed isodensity mass lesions on plain CT, which were homogeneously enhanced by contrast medium. The pathological study showed that all cases were derived from B-cells. Five were classified as immunoblastic type (IBL), 9 as diffuse large type (DL), and the others were classified according to WF. 17 of 21 cases (81%) were sensitive to radiotherapy, and 15 of 19 cases (79%) responded to corticosteroid. A prognostic study revealed that patients with IBL had less hope than those with DL. From this result, it seems that WF classification is better than LSG classification for obtaining a prognosis in malignant lymphoma patients. The frequency of primary CNS-NHL has been increasing for the past several decades and will surpass that of any other brain tumors in the near future because of the explosive expansion of AIDS patients. Therefore, not only clinicopathological analysis but also biological study for CNS-NHL might be important.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We examined the availability and appropriateness of allogeneic bone marrow transplantation for CML in 10 economically advanced countries with diverse health care systems. For each country we obtained data on the likelihood of transplantation to treat CML in patients under the age of 55 years, the length of time from diagnosis to transplantation, and the stage of disease at the time of transplantation. METHODS: Data were collected on 9873 allogeneic bone marrow transplantations performed at 208 centers in 10 countries from 1989 through 1991. Data were acquired from transplantation registries and by means of a mailed survey of all centers and teams that did not contribute data to registries. Data on the incidence of disease were drawn from national and regional cancer registries. RESULTS: Among the 10 countries there was a twofold difference between the lowest and highest rates of transplantation to treat CML (0.26 to 0.54 per 100,000 population per year); Swedish patients were the most likely to receive a transplant, and German patients the least likely. The median length of time from diagnosis to transplantation ranged from 6.8 to 15.4 months. In all countries, most transplantations were performed in the chronic phase of the disease, but as many as a third of patients received transplants in the less favorable accelerated or blast phase. The values for the United States fell near the middle of those for the 10 countries on all measures. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings challenge the assumption that the United States is unique in providing broad access to high-technology treatments.

Detection of p53 mutations was made by single stranded conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis of exons 4 to 10 of the P53 gene and confirmed by direct sequencing. Circulating antibodies to p53 were seen in three of the 83 (3.5%) patients analyzed, and a p53 point mutation was found in ten cases. Two of the three patients with p53 antibodies had a p53 mutation, but the remaining case had no detectable mutation. The other eight mutated cases had no detectable p53 antibodies. Our findings show that serological analysis of p53 antibodies is rarely positive in MDS and AML. This could be due to the relatively low incidence of p53 mutations seen in those disorders, but also to the immune depression to which they are often associated.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These cell lines were analyzed for expression of a panel of hematopoietic differentiation markers by Northern blot analysis. They were all found to express one or several biochemical markers characteristic of immature cells in monocytic development, including myeloperoxidase, N-elastase, cathepsin G, myeloblastin, and azurocidin. Normal peripheral blood monocytes did not express these markers. Moreover, several markers expressed at high levels in mature monocytes, such as lysozyme, CD14, MHC class II and alpha-1 antitrypsin were either not expressed or were expressed only at low levels in the three cell lines analyzed. These results show that arrested differentiation at a relatively early stage of monoblast development is a common denominator for these human monocytic cell lines. Thus, transforming mutations acting at such an immature differentiation stage may frequently lead to neoplastic transformation, whereas similar mutations occurring at a more mature differentiation stage never give rise to any leukemias due to the loss of proliferative potential in committed cells.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Exogenous recombinant IL-2 induced, in a dose-response manner, cell proliferation in ten out of 23 cases and this effect was independent of the expression of IL-2R alpha; however, only cells expressing high affinity IL-2R could respond to exogenous rIL-2. Moreover, anti-IL-2R alpha moAb could inhibit both spontaneous (in three out of five cases) and IL-2-induced (in five out of five cases) B-CLL cell proliferation.

Monocytes express the esterase isoenzyme (termed 'monocyte-specific esterase', MSE) that can be inhibited by NaF in the alpha-naphthyl acetate cytochemical staining. We examined the expression of MSE in normal cells and primary and cultured leukemia-lymphoma cells. The MSE protein was demonstrated by isoelectric focusing (IEF); MSE mRNA expression was investigated by Northern blotting and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The following samples were positive for MSE protein and Northern mRNA expression: 20/24 monocytic, 4/32 myeloid, and 1/20 erythroid-megakaryocytic leukemia cell lines, but none of the 112 lymphoid leukemia or lymphoma cell lines; of the normal purified cell populations only the monocytes were positive whereas, T, B cells, and granulocytes were negative; of primary acute (myelo) monocytic leukemia cells (CD14-positive, FAB M4/M5 morphology) 14/20 were Northern mRNA and 11/14 IEF protein positive. RT-PCR revealed MSE expression in 29/49 Northern-negative lymphoid leukemia-lymphoma cell lines. The RT-PCR signals in monocytic cell lines were on average 50-fold stronger than the mostly weak trace expression in lymphoid specimens. On treatment with various biomodulators, only all-trans retinoic acid significantly upregulated MSE message and protein levels but could not induce new MSE expression in several leukemia cell lines; lipopolysaccharide and interferon-gamma increased MSE expression in normal monocytes. Analysis of DNA methylation with sensitive restriction enzymes showed no apparent regulation of gene expression by differential methylation; the MSE gene is evolutionarily conserved among mammalian species; the half-life of the human MSE transcripts was about 5-6 h. The extent of MSE expression varied greatly among different monocytic leukemia samples. However, the MSE overexpression in a significant number of specimens was not associated with gene amplification, gross structural rearrangements or point mutations within the cDNA region. Taken together, the results suggest that MSE expression is not absolutely specific for, but strongly associated with cells of the monocytic lineage; MSE is either not expressed at all or expressed at much lower levels in cells from other lineages. The biological significance, if any, of rare MSE messages in lymphoid cells detectable only by the hypersensitive RT-PCR remains unclear. Further studies on the regulation of this gene and on the physiological function of the enzyme will no doubt be informative with respect to its striking overexpression in some malignant cells and to a possible role in the pathobiology of monocytic leukemias.",['MSE'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two genes, bcr and abl, are involved in this translocation. As a consequence, parts of the bcr and abl genes are fused, resulting in chimeric bcr-abl genes encoding chimeric BCR-ABL proteins. Three bcr-abl genes and proteins have been identified: e1-a2 P190bcr-abl, b2-a2 P210bcr-abl, and b3-a2 P210bcr-abl. Since these chimeric proteins only occur in Ph-chromosome-positive leukemic cells, they are by definition tumor-specific markers. Ph-chromosome-positive ALL is correlated with a bad prognosis, therefore the detection of chimeric BCR-ABL proteins is of prime importance in ALL diagnosis. In the present study, we report on the generation of a monoclonal antibody termed ER-FP1, raised against the tumor-specific e1-a2 BCR-ABL junction in P190bcr-abl. We show that ER-FP1 reacts highly specifically with e1-a2 P190bcr-abl in different assays. The reactivity of ER-FP1 with e1-a2 P190bcr-abl in soluble form was analyzed in an immunoprecipitation assay; specificity was confirmed by peptide inhibition studies. Binding of ER-FP1 to e1-a2 P190bcr-abl at the single cell level was detected by using immunofluorescence techniques.

In this study, we have investigated topoisomerase II mRNA expression in leukaemic blasts from 23 AML patients. Expression levels ranged from 1-47% relative to the haemopoietic cell line HL60 in 16 evaluable patients. Thirteen of 16 patients achieved complete remission (CR). We have therefore chosen ease of entry into CR as the most sensitive clinical correlate. Decreased topoisomerase II mRNA expression in vitro results in drug resistance. The clinical relevance of reduced expression is not known. All cases of AML and de novo AML have been studied separately. We are unable to identify a correlation between topoisomerase II mRNA levels and ease of entry into CR in either of these groups. Taking these findings into account, group size calculations have been undertaken and indicate that a multi-centre study of this question is warranted.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The cellular pharmacokinetics of ara-CTP in circulating blasts were determined during and after each ara-C dose, and the area under the accumulation and elimination curve (AUC) measured over 12 h was compared before and after GM-CSF. Ara-CTP accumulation peaked within 1 h after the end of each ara-C infusion. Comparison of the AUC of ara-CTP before and after GM-CSF administration suggested that in the blasts of three of four patients, GM-CSF treatment decreased the ara-CTP AUC; the AUC values were altered only slightly in a fourth patient. Studies of these patients' blasts incubated in vitro with ara-C before and after clinical infusion of GM-CSF revealed similar ara-CTP accumulation patterns.

Most of the primary granules may be incorporated into Auer rods, sometimes stacked in bundles of faggots. (ii) Microgranular APL, characterized by fine dustlike granulation in the cytoplasm; some promyelocytes may even appear agranular by light microscopy. Most of the cells show bilobed or folded nuclei, a picture which may simulate that of acute myelomonocytic leukemia. (iii) Hyperbasophilic form, characterized by cells with high N/C ratio, and strongly basophilic cytoplasm with either sparse or no granules. Conspicuous cytoplasmatic budding is usually present, recalling the feature of micromegakaryocytes. Strong positivity for myeloperoxidase, Sudan black B and chloroacetate esterase represents the typical cytochemical pattern of M3; usually a weaker reactivity may be observed in M3v. However, sometimes a degree of cytochemical heterogeneity of APL cells may be observed, as suggested by cases displaying a strong sodium fluoride-sensitive non-specific esterase reaction.

Retrospective studies have reported a possible association between hair dyes and hematopoietic cancers. PURPOSE: Our purpose was to investigate if permanent hair dye was associated with risks of incident lymphoma, leukemia, and multiple myeloma in the Nurses' Health Study, a prospective cohort study of 99,067 women aged 30-55 years in 1976. METHODS: Questionnaires regarding medical history and other health-related variables were sent to Nurses' Health Study participants every 2 years from 1976 to 1990. The follow-up for mortality in this cohort exceeds 98%. We identified 244 newly diagnosed cases of hematopoietic cancers, confirmed by pathology reports. Permanent hair dye use was ascertained over four cycles of questionnaires from 1976-1982; status of hair dye use established in 1982 was then used for the remainder of the follow-up time (through 1990). Age-specific incidence rates were calculated and used to compute relative risks (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: We found no evidence of a positive association between ever use of permanent hair dye and all hematopoietic cancers (age-adjusted RR = 0.9; 95% CI = 0.7-1.2) or specific types (Hodgkin's lymphoma [RR = 0.9; 95% CI = 0.4-2.1], non-Hodgkin's lymphoma [RR = 1.1; 95% CI = 0.8-1.6], multiple myeloma [RR = 0.4; 95% CI = 0.2-0.9], chronic lymphocytic leukemia [RR = 0.6; 95% CI = 0.3-1.5], and other leukemias [RR = 0.8; 95% CI = 0.3-1.9]). Further examination of age at first use, duration, frequency, and time since first use and risk of all hematopoietic cancers or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (the largest diagnostic group), indicated no material associations. CONCLUSION: In this prospective cohort study, permanent hair dye use is not adversely related to risks of hematopoietic cancers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Further, the relationship between cumulative dose of cytotoxic drug, radiation dose to active bone marrow, and the risk of ANLL following NHL have not been well described. PURPOSE: Our purpose was to examine the risk of ANLL in relationship to all prior treatment for NHL. METHODS: Within a cohort study of 11,386 2-year survivors of NHL, 35 case patients with secondary ANLL were identified and matched to 140 controls with NHL who did not develop ANLL. The primary eligibility criteria for the cohort included a diagnosis of NHL as a first primary cancer from January 1, 1965, through December 31, 1989; age 18 through 70 years at the time of initial diagnosis; and survival for 2 or more years without the development of a second invasive primary malignancy. Detailed information on chemotherapeutic drugs and radiotherapy was collected for all patients. Standard conditional logistic regression programs were used to estimate the relative risk (RR) of ANLL associated with specific therapies by comparing the exposure histories of case patients with individually matched controls. RESULTS: Significant excesses of ANLL followed therapy with either prednimustine (RR = 13.4; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.1-156; P trend for dose < .05) or regimens containing mechlorethamine and procarbazine (RR = 12.6; 95% CI = 2.0-79; P < .05). Elevated risks of leukemia following therapy with chlorambucil were restricted to patients given cumulative doses of 1300 mg or more (RR = 6.5; 95% CI = 1.6-26; P < .05). Cyclophosphamide regimens were associated with a small, nonsignificant increased risk of ANLL (RR = 1.8;95% CI = 0.7-4.9), with most patients receiving relatively low cumulative doses (< 20,000 mg). Radiotherapy given at higher doses without alkylating agents was linked to a nonsignificant threefold risk of ANLL compared with lower dose radiation or no radiotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that prednimustine may be a human carcinogen, with a positive dose-response gradient evident for ANLL risk. The low, nonsignificant risk of leukemia associated with cyclophosphamide was reassuring because this drug is commonly used today. Despite the excesses of ANLL associated with specific therapies, secondary leukemia remains a rare occurrence following NHL. Of 10,000 NHL patients treated for 6 months with selected regimens including low cumulative doses of cyclophosphamide and followed for 10 years, an excess of four leukemias might be expected.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Native SP-22 showed an M(r) of 350,000 +/- 20,000, and was composed of more than 10 molecules of an M(r) 21,600 subunit. Subcellular and submitochondrial fractionation of adrenocortical tissues revealed that SP-22 was localized in the mitochondrial matrix, suggesting that SP-22 is a natural substrate for ATP-dependent protease, a matrix enzyme. The concentration of SP-22 in adrenocortical mitochondrial fractions was 16 +/- 3 micrograms/mg proteins (mean +/- SD, n = 6) as determined by radioimmunoassay using specific anti-SP-22 antibody. Adrenal cortex showed the highest concentration among the 15 bovine tissues tested, followed by liver, renal cortex, adrenal medulla, heart, and renal medulla. We determined the amino acid sequence of SP-22, which is composed of 195 amino acids. Amino acid 47 was not identified by the sequencer. FAB-mass spectrometry of AA47-AA55 fragment revealed that AA47 was cysteine-sulfinic acid (Cys-SO2H). By a homology search in the NBRF-PIR data base, SP-22 was found to be 91% homologous to murine erythroleukemia cell MER-5 protein, which may have an important role in the induction of differentiation. SP-22 was also homologous to the C22 component of alkyl hydroperoxide reductase in Salmonella typhimurium, thiol-specific antioxidant in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and some other proteins. Since a segment around AA47 was highly conserved, this residue may be important for the biochemical functions of SP-22.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Peripheral blood and bone marrow aspirate smears demonstrated increased LGLs. Flow cytometry showed that these cells expressed NK-associated surface antigens. Cytogenetic analysis of the bone marrow aspirate showed two distinct but related clones with multiple copies of a modified 7 marker chromosome. Death followed colonic perforation. Findings at necropsy included bone marrow lymphocytosis and erythrophagocytosis, a mononucleosis-like lymphadenitis, atypical hepatitis with a mixed, predominantly T-cell infiltrate, interstitial pneumonitis, and multiorgan system vasculitis with perforation of the transverse colon. Epstein-Barr virus transcripts were identified in lymphocytes infiltrating liver and peripheral nerve by in situ hybridization. In addition, Southern blot analyses showed monoclonal bands superimposed on oligoclonal ladders of EBV termini in liver and lymph node. The identical episomal form of EBV was found in the bone marrow, lymph node, and liver.

The DNA contents of K 562 cells treated with tumour necrosis factor-alpha showed that after 24 h there were less cells in the G1 and S phases and more cells in the G2/M phase than in the control group. The phase of upregulation of transferrin receptors induced by tumour necrosis factor-alpha may be dependent on the cell cycle.

Serum IgG levels were significantly higher after three doses (p = 0.0002), and stabilized just above lower reference value after 11 doses. The total number of infection-related events during 168 months before therapy was compared to the total number of infection-related events in 169 months during therapy. The number of antibiotic prescriptions was reduced from 78 to 54 (N.S.), the number of admissions to hospital due to infections was reduced from 16 to 5 (p = 0.047) and the number of febrile episodes was reduced from 63 to 31 (p = 0.004).

We retrospectively analyzed the efficiency of leukocyte-depleted blood components in preventing refractoriness in 140 adult patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), treated according to a standardized cytostatic protocol. Sixty-eight patients received leukocyte-depleted (L-D) platelet concentrates (PCs) and red cells (RBCs), with fewer than 10(6) leukocytes per unit, and 72 patients received standard (STD) blood components. Two of 67 (3%) evaluable patients in the leukocyte-depleted group and 14 of 68 (21%) in the standard group became refractory during the median follow-up time of 229 days. Nine of 24 (37%) previously pregnant women in the STD group but none of 17 in the L-D group became refractory. Twenty patients were shifted during later treatment from L-D to STD PCs; none became refractory. Corrected platelet increments (CI) at 18 hours were higher after STD PCs (6.50 than L-D PCs (5.2), but more PCs and RBCs were transfused per patient in the STD group. It is concluded that effective leukocyte depletion prevents platelet refractoriness in patients with AML, even in those with previous immunization, and reduces the consumption of blood components.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DC from infected mice as early as 3 days postinfection had a reduced ability to stimulate allogeneic normal T cells in the mixed lymphocyte reaction. T cells did become infected during the coculture but block of cross-infection of T cells by zidovudine did not abolish the inhibitory effect. Other DC-dependent responses were also reduced on infection including DC-stimulated responses to influenza virus. ConA and PMA induced an increase in [Ca2+]i level in DC from control mice. A low baseline level of [Ca2+]i in DC from infected mice and reduced calcium mobilization upon ConA stimulation was found at all periods of infection. Ultraviolet-inactivated Rauscher leukemia virus failed to provoke significant changes in DC function in vivo. Six or 7 days after RLV infection DC expressed lower levels of Iad but not H2Dd molecules in parallel with lower expression of some adhesion molecules (CD18, CD54, CD44). No differences in expression of B7 surface antigen between control and infected mice were obtained. We did not find any evidence for the induction of apoptosis of naive syngeneic or allogeneic T cells by infected dendritic cells. The changes in DC function may have implications for the pathogenesis of retroviral infections including HIV infection.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For women in this age group, the five leading causes of cancer death were carcinomas of the lung, breast, colon and rectum, pancreas, and ovary. To determine the representation of the elderly in clinical trials, the 1992 accrual of the National Cancer Institute (NCI)-sponsored Clinical Cooperative Group treatment trials (which included more than 8000 elderly patients) for the aforementioned sites was compared with the 1990 incidence data from the NCI's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program. Of the male patients enrolled in the trials, an average of 39% were older than 65 (47.3% lung, 79.5% prostate, 47.5% colorectal, 45.6% pancreas, and 9.6% leukemia); whereas 25.9% of all women enrolled in trials were 65 or older (43.6% lung, 17.3% breast, 46.2% colorectal, 59.6% pancreas, and 35.4% ovary). With respect to incidence, older patients generally are underrepresented in cancer treatment trials. With the exception of the data on prostate cancer, each of the comparisons using the Z statistic gave probability values of less than 0.01. The most significant discrepancies between incidence and participation in cancer treatment protocols were noted for leukemia in males and breast cancer in females. Possible explanations for these findings include (1) a research focus on aggressive therapy, which may be unacceptably toxic to the elderly; (2) presence of comorbidity in the elderly; (3) fewer trials available specifically aimed at older patients; (4) limited expectations for long term benefits on the part of physicians, relatives, and the patients themselves; and (5) a lack of financial, logistic, and social support for the participation of elderly patients in clinical trials. Recognizing this situation, NCI recently sponsored a number of trials that specifically target the elderly. This paper describes the status of all major Phase II and III clinical trials that recently were closed, still are active, or now are in review that address the clinical care of this important segment of the U.S. population.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HSV type 1 was isolated more frequently than HSV type 2 (8 versus 2). Acyclovir showed standard in vitro activity against all isolates. Our results suggest that oral mucositis in children receiving antineoplastic treatment is probably multifactorial in origin and that HSV can be an important cofactor, especially in children who are seropositive for HSV.

DESIGN: Observed and expected numbers of cases were calculated and analysed by standard methods based on ratios of observed to expected counts and by a new statistical test, the linear risk score test, based on ranks and designed to be sensitive to excess incidence in close proximity to a putative source of risk. SETTING: Electoral wards within 25 km of 23 nuclear installations and six control sites that had been investigated for suitability for generating stations but never used. SUBJECTS: Children below age 15 in England and Wales, 1966-87. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Registration of any leukaemia or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. RESULTS: In none of the 25 km circles around the installations was the incidence ratio significantly greater than 1.0. The only significant results for the linear risk score test were for Sellafield (P = 0.00002) and Burghfield (P = 0.031). The circles for Aldermaston and Burghfield overlap; the incidence ratio was 1.10 in each. One of the control sites gave a significant linear risk score test result (P = 0.020). All the tests carried out were one sided with P values estimated by simulation. CONCLUSION: There is no evidence of a general increase of childhood leukaemia or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma around nuclear installations. Apart from Sellafield, the evidence for distance related risk is very weak.",,PMC2542713,,,,,,,,,,,,

CPT, 10-hydroxycamptothecin, and 10,11-methylenedioxycamptothecin produced equivalent amounts of cell growth inhibition and/or DNA single-strand breakage in the two cell lines. TPT, SN-38 (the active metabolite of CPT-11), and 9-aminocamptothecin were 12-, 9-, and 10-fold, respectively, less toxic to the MDR than to the wild-type cells. These findings are consistent with differences in yields of DNA single-strand breaks produced in AuxB1 and CHRC5 cells by 2-hr incubations with the various compounds. In both assays, the resistance ratios of the topoisomerase I inhibitors were approximately one-tenth those of known MDR drugs such as vinblastine or amsacrine. Thus, cultured cells that overexpress P-glycoprotein have the potential to develop some level of cross-resistance to all three topoisomerase I inhibitors currently in the clinic. The chemical basis for cross-resistance of cultured MDR cell lines to certain CPT analogues is not yet understood, but is likely more complex than positive charge alone. TPT had a reasonable therapeutic effect on B6D2F1 female mice implanted with MDR sublines of P388 leukemia, compared with its effect on mice implanted with wild-type P388 cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two practically relevant problems that occur when applying unmodified kernel estimators are boundary effects near the endpoints of the support of the hazard rate, and a substantial increase in the variance from left to right over the range of abscissae where the hazard rate is estimated. A new class of boundary kernels is proposed for the first problem. Explicit formulas for these kernels are developed, and it is shown that this boundary correction works well in practice. A data-adaptive varying bandwidth selection procedure is proposed for the second problem. This procedure generally will lead to increasing bandwidths near the left endpoint and toward the right endpoint, and will lead to smaller integrated mean squared error of the hazard rate estimator as compared to a fixed bandwidth method. A practically feasible method incorporating the new boundary kernels and local bandwidth choices is implemented and illustrated with survival data from a leukemia study.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to evaluate the diagnostic value of various available procedures, we analyzed our findings regarding 26 leukemic patients with hepatosplenic candidiasis. A significantly increased level (> 50 mg/L) of serum C-reactive protein (S-CRP) was significantly more common than a daily fever (for which the mean temperature peak was > 37.5 degrees C) or raised levels of liver enzymes (serum alanine transferase, aspartate transferase, or alkaline phosphatase). Focal changes in the liver, spleen, or kidneys were detected in > 90% of the patients examined by computed tomography (CT) but in < 50% of those examined by ultrasonography. Seventeen diagnoses were based on the findings from microscopy of samples obtained invasively, whereas a positive fungal culture was the basis of the diagnosis for only five patients. In conclusion, monitoring the S-CRP level after a patient's recovery from neutropenia is useful in that its elevation is cause for early suspicion of hepatosplenic candidiasis. In detection of the hepatosplenic foci, CT is superior to ultrasonography. For establishing the specific diagnosis, aggressive collection of samples for microscopy is essential.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This fact, suspected on the basis of cytogenetic findings, has been confirmed by long-term bone marrow cultures (LTBMC) and the combined use of phenotypic and molecular studies. Based on the lack of HLA-DR expression, it has been possible to recognize a benign subpopulation within the stem-cell compartment in CML. Different in vitro techniques have been developed for the selection of these benign progenitors, including LTBMC, marrow incubation with cytolytic drugs or interferon, positive selection based on their phenotypic characteristics, and exposure to synthetic antisense oligodeoxynucleotides. In vivo selection with interferon or intensive chemotherapy is also possible. The primary goal of the selection of benign hematopoietic progenitors is their use for autotransplantation. To date, a few hundred CML patients have been submitted to the latter procedure using bone marrow or peripheral blood. The fact that the majority of them show evidence of persistent disease emphasizes the necessity for better selection methods of the benign progenitors, for intensifying the conditioning regimen to reduce the tumor burden as much as possible, and for the use of adjuvant therapy post-transplantation. Future trends include the refinement of positive selection methods, negative selection by taking advantage of the different stromal adhesiveness of the benign and malignant progenitors, or the use of autologous natural killer cells, antisense oligodeoxynucleotides, or specific antibodies to the bcr/abl junction region, and retroviral marking to determine the origin of relapse in autologous transplantation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Study of the regulation of other tumor suppressor genes during these processes has been instrumental in defining their interactions and functions. In this study, we performed experiments to assess the suitability of the human K562 erythroleukemia cell line for studying the WT1 gene during differentiation. We predicted that WT1 mRNA would be decreased during induction of differentiation of K562 cells based on observations of decreased WT1 mRNA during kidney development and in differentiated Wilms' tumors and leukemias. Accordingly, we found that WT1 mRNA was down-regulated in K562 cells during induction of erythroid and megakaryocytic differentiation by sodium butyrate and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, respectively. Down-regulation of WT1 mRNA was not a generalized phenomenon of growth inhibition. WT1 mRNA was not down-regulated when 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-induced differentiation was blocked by bryostatin-1. During 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate treatment, the decrease in WT1 mRNA was rapid (within 5 min), continuous, and occurred, at least in part, posttranscriptionally. An analysis of the 5' flanking region and transcription initiation sites of the human WT1 gene also was performed.

Secretion can also be induced in permeabilized cells by the addition of the ATP analogue, ATP gamma S [adenosine-5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate)], which is relatively resistant to phosphatase activity. ATP gamma S-induced secretion (35-50% of total amine) is temperature and concentration-dependent. Calcium enhances secretion, but unlike antigen-induced secretion, it does occur in the absence of calcium and without the requirement for inositol phospholipid hydrolysis. Other ATP analogues induced secretion in the rank order AMP-PNP > or = ATP gamma S >>> AMP-PCP > ATP alpha S = ATP [AMP-PNP, adenylyl-imidodiphosphate; AMP-PCP, adenylyl (beta,gamma-methylene)-diphosphonate; ATP alpha S, adenosine-5'-O-(1-thiotriphosphate)]. At equimolar concentrations, ATP inhibits ATP gamma S-induced secretion by 50%, but prolonged incubation in the presence of ATP gamma S surmounts the ATP inhibition. ADP is nearly as effective an inhibitor, but GTP and ITP are ineffective. It is likely that secretion occurs through attachment at an ATP-binding site, effectively blocking the action of a phosphatase, active later in the normal secretory pathway.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To evaluate this, a human TNF cDNA was transferred to human lung cancer cell lines in vitro using a retrovirus vector to produce TNF cDNA-modified cell lines secreting TNF. In vitro cell growth was similar for parental and modified cells. All cells were resistant to TNF. The in vivo tumorigenicity of parental and modified cells was compared in nude mice. Animals injected subcutaneously with parental cells uniformly developed tumors. Tumor growth was markedly less for all modified cells, and this suppression of tumor development was reversed by anti-TNF antibody administration. Animals injected with a mixture of 50% modified and 50% parental cells or parental cell tumors injected with modified cells had decreased tumor growth, demonstrating that modified cells could suppress tumorigenicity.

In germ line cells and in established cell lines, telomerase activity maintains the length of the telomeres by de novo synthesis of telomeric repeats, in humans (T2AG3)n. Recently, it was for the first time shown the existence of telomerase activity in human ovarian carcinomas. In the present study we show that telomerase activation can also occur in human hematopoietic tumor cells in vivo.

Eight cases demonstrated an RNAse A sensitive ability to add new nucleotides to the human telomere sequence. Nine acute leukemias were tested telomerase negative. Our data demonstrate that telomerase activation in vivo seems to be a common event in B cell neoplasias with a mature immunophenotype like non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and myeloma, in contrast to acute leukemias of B, T or myeloid cell origin.

Studies with a glutathione S-transferase-Lyn fusion protein were performed to explore the potential significance of p56/p53lyn activation. Analysis of the adsorbates demonstrates interaction of Lyn with the cell cycle regulatory protein, p34cdc2. Coimmunoprecipitation studies further confirmed the association of p56/p53lyn and p34cdc2 in MMC-treated cells. We also demonstrate that p34cdc2 undergoes increased phosphorylation on tyrosine following MMC exposure and that p56/p53lyn phosphorylates the Tyr-15 site of p34cdc2 in vitro. These findings indicate that the cellular response to MMC includes activation of p56/p53lyn and that this event may contribute to signals transduced by the DNA damage-dependent mitotic checkpoint.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Numerical anomalies for one or more chromosomes were detected in all 14 cases. The FISH results were compared with those obtained by conventional cytogenetic analysis. A hyperdiploid karyotype was evident in 5 cases, the others were either normal or lacking cytogenetic results because of technical failure. In the 5 cytogenetically hyperdiploid cases, 14 numerical abnormalities were observed with both techniques, whereas 4 numerical deviations were found only with FISH. In 9 other cases which had a DNA content indicating hyperdiploidy, 34 trisomies and 2 tetrasomies were detected by FISH analysis. Furthermore, in 1 case duplication of the Y chromosome and in 3 male cases duplication of the X chromosome were evident. Double-target FISH experiments in 2 patients allowed the correlation of numerical aberrations of 2 chromosomes in one and the same cell. By such analyses, detection of subpopulations of tumor cells was found to be relatively easy.

Eight of the 28 flavonoids and 4 of the 11 lignans showed considerable suppressive effects on HL-60 cell growth with IC50s ranging from 10-940 ng/ml. Among these compounds, genistein, honokiol, machilin A, matairesinol, and arctigenin had the strongest effects with IC50s less than 100 ng/ml, which were almost equivalent to the effects of current anti-cancer agents. The flavonoid genistein and the lignans, however, showed little or no cytotoxicity against HL-60 cells as assessed by dye exclusion tests (LC50s > 2,900 ng/ml), whereas the regular anti-cancer agents had potent cytotoxicity. All of the flavonoids and lignans, except for machilin A and arctigenin, were less effective against growth of human T lymphocytic leukemia cell line MOLT-4. In addition, the flavonoid and the lignans showed little or no inhibiting activity on mitogen-induced blastogenesis of human peripheral-blood lymphocytes. The lignans and genistein were strongly suppressive against incorporations of [3H]thymidine, [3H]uridine, and [3H]leucine into HL-60 cells.

DESIGN: A literature search restricted to English-language articles, abstracts, book chapters, and reports published between 1975 and 1993 was conducted both electronically using MEDLINE and CANCERLIT and manually using the bibliographies of the electronically retrieved data base. Of approximately 1,000 publications identified for analysis, 233 were selected as representative of important advances in CLL. RESULTS: The last 10 years have witnessed renewed interest in the biology and treatment of CLL, a disease long viewed by clinicians as following an indolent course and perceived by investigators as uninspiring. This interest, based on advances in understanding the lineage and biology of CLL and on the advent of new and more efficacious chemotherapeutic agents, has led to improvements in patient survival and, for the first time, to complete remissions (CRs) in large subsets of patients. As we learn to use these agents better, especially in combination chemotherapy, alternative therapeutic modalities, are being vigorously pursued, including high-dose ablative chemotherapy with allogeneic or autologous bone marrow transplantation (BMT) rescue and the use of powerful tumor-cell target-specific immunoreagents. These therapeutic advances, coupled with the recent availability of molecular probes to ascertain objectively minimal remnant disease posttreatment, provide a basis for developing and assessing ever more efficacious and potentially curative treatment strategies for the management of this disease. CONCLUSION: For the first time since the original 1924 monograph by Minot and Isaacs, the cure of subsets of patients with CLL appears not to be an unreasonable goal.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: From January 1989 to February 1992, 20 patients received 28 courses of treatment. Each course of treatment consisted of a 1-hour intravenous (IV) infusion of VP-16 100 mg/m2/d for 5 days, followed by a 23-hour IV infusion of carboplatin each day. The initial, total 5-day dose of carboplatin (1,000 mg/m2) was escalated by 250- to 375-mg increments to a final, total dose of 1,875 mg/m2 over 5 days. RESULTS: Significant marrow suppression was observed in all patients, with prolonged marrow aplasia at the 1,875-mg/m2 dose level. Grade III diarrhea occurred in three patients; 10 patients experienced life-threatening infection and three had severe thrombocytopenic bleeding. Major marrow responses (two complete remissions and two partial remissions) occurred in four patients (20%). CONCLUSION: In view of the apparent antileukemic efficacy and minimal extramedullary toxicity, carboplatin deserves further study in a phase II trial.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The protocol consisted of a remission-induction phase that lasted 30 days and started with cyclophosphamide (CTX) 1.2 g/m2 on day 1, followed by vincristine (VCR) 1.5 mg/m2 on days 3, 10, 17, and 24, daunomycin (DAUNO) 60 mg/m2 on days 12 and 13, and prednisone 40 mg/m2/d for 30 days. If a complete remission was achieved, an intensification regimen was given that consisted of eight courses of teniposide (VM-26) 165 mg/m2 plus cytarabine (ARA-C) 300 mg/m2 every 4 days according to bone marrow tolerance. A continuation phase was subsequently started, with alternating courses of thioguanine (6-TG) 300 mg/m2/d for 4 days plus CTX 1.2 g/m2 on day 5; hydroxyurea 2.5 g/m2/d for 4 days plus DAUNO 45 mg/m2 on day 5; VCR 1.5 mg/m2 plus methotrexate (MTX) 120 mg/m2 (24 hours apart); mercaptopurine (6-MP) 500 mg/m2/d for 4 days plus MTX 40 mg/m2; and VM-26 plus ARA-C for 3 courses (4 days apart), by the end of 48 weeks. CNS prophylaxis consisted of intrathecal administration of MTX, ARA-C, and dexamethasone according to age, administered three times during remission induction and every 6 weeks afterwards. RESULTS: By the end of the analysis in July 1991, 38 of 39 patients had attained a complete remission and 36 were event-free survivors. Two failures that occurred after completion of therapy were second malignancies (acute lymphocytic leukemia and acute nonlymphocytic leukemia). CONCLUSION: These results are significantly better than those obtained with less intensive former regimens performed in our institution before the availability of VM-26. The favorable impact of an intense consolidation phase with VM-26 is remarkably exemplified by three additional patients not included in this study whose families withdrew them from therapy after the intensification phase, all three of whom have been in remission.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: In 1986, the Pediatric Oncology Group (POG) began a randomized trial to test two schedules of consolidation chemotherapy in children with newly diagnosed B-precursor cell ALL. MTX and Ara-C were given as overlapping 24-hour infusions. The dose and sequence of MTX and Ara-C administration were based on a preclinical model that had demonstrated synergism between these two agents. Two hundred fifteen patients in complete remission were randomized to front-loading consolidation therapy in which six MTX/Ara-C infusions were administered at 3-week intervals from the 7th through the 19th week of therapy. Two hundred thirteen patients in complete remission were randomized to receive standard consolidation therapy in which the six MTX/Ara-C infusions were given every 12 weeks from the 7th through the 67th week of therapy. RESULTS: Both regimens produced similar rates of adverse side effects, except for a higher incidence of CNS toxicity in individuals randomized to the front-loading arm (32 of 215 v 12 of 213 patients, P = .002). Leukoencephalopathy occurred in three patients on the front-loading regimen and was permanent in one. By Kaplan-Meier analysis, the probability of continuing in complete remission for 5 years was 79% (SE = 5%) and 85% (SE = 5%) for good-risk patients, and 66% (SE = 6%) and 61% (SE = 7%) for poor-risk patients randomized to front-loading and standard regimens, respectively. CONCLUSION: Although differences in complete remission durations were not statistically significant by log-rank analysis (P = .62 for good-risk patients, .89 for poor-risk patients, and .99 overall), the results are comparable to those in previous studies using more toxic agents as components of remission consolidation therapy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Seventy-nine patients underwent BMT from a human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-identical sibling using cyclosporine/methotrexate for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis. Thirty-four patients had early leukemia (acute leukemia or lymphoblastic lymphoma in first remission, chronic myelogenous leukemia [CML], or refractory anemia [RA]), and 45 patients had more advanced disease. Patients received etoposide 1,500 mg/m2 on day -8, followed by cyclophosphamide 60 mg/kg/d on days -7 and -6, and 10.2 Gy of TBI administered in six fractions of 1.7 Gy given twice daily for 3 days from day -3 to -1. Donor bone marrow was harvested and infused on day 0. RESULTS: Patients with early leukemia had a disease-free survival rate of 53% +/- 9% and an overall survival rate of 57% +/- 10% at 3 years. Patients with advanced disease had a disease-free survival rate of 15% +/- 5% and overall survival rate of 17% +/- 5%. The actuarial relapse rate for the early-leukemia group is 33% +/- 9% versus 69% +/- 9% for patients with more advanced disease. Severe toxicity was most frequently manifested as pulmonary hemorrhage followed by multiorgan failure and death. The 100-day mortality rate for the early-leukemia group was 10% versus 50% for patients with more advanced disease. CONCLUSION: The combination of cyclophosphamide, etoposide, and TBI is a relatively safe and effective preparative regimen for patients with early hematologic malignancies. Controlled trials are needed to evaluate critically this combination versus other standard preparative regimens. Greater toxicity was observed in patients with advanced disease, and this program does not appear to offer any advantage over other regimens.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Stem cells are capable of self-renewal and differentiation into individual lymphomyeloid lineages. Available evidence indicates that the decision of a stem cell to self-renew or differentiate and the decision of a multipotential progenitor to select a lineage pathway during differentiation (commitment) are intrinsic to the progenitors and are stochastic in nature. In contrast, proliferative kinetics of the progenitors, namely, survival and expansion of the progenitors, appear to be controlled by a number of interacting cytokines. Whereas proliferation and maturation of committed progenitors are controlled by late-acting factors such as erythropoietin, macrophage colony-stimulating factor, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, and interleukin-5, progenitors at earlier stages of development are controlled by a group of several overlapping cytokines. Interleukin-3, granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and interleukin-4 regulate proliferation of multipotential progenitors only after they are triggered to exit from dormancy state. Triggering of cycling of dormant primitive progenitors and proliferation of lymphohemopoietic primitive progenitors appear to require interactions of early acting cytokines including interleukin-6, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, interleukin-11, interleukin-12, leukemia inhibitory factor, and steel factor.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We show that, in appropriate experimental conditions, TALL-104 cells could effectively reverse the aggressive growth of the myelomonocytic leukemia cell line U937 in SCID mouse tissues, leading to complete abrogation of AML. A single transfer of TALL-104 cells at the time of tumor challenge in combination with recombinant human (rh) IL-12 (1 microgram/d) prolonged significantly the life of the mice. However, eradication of leukemia, as monitored both clinically and by PCR, was achieved by repeated injection of the effectors at close intervals. Complete cure was obtained also upon transfer of lethally irradiated (non-proliferating) TALL-104 cells together with low doses of rh IL-2 (100 U/d). Most notably, of the mice that received multiple transfers of TALL-104 cells without cytokines in an advanced disease stage, 50% were clinically cured, and 50% survived significantly longer. The potential of TALL-104 cells as an effective and safe leukemia purging agent is discussed.",,PMC295167,,,,,,,,,,,,

Transfecting these resistant HL-525 cells with expression vectors containing either PKC-beta I or PKC-beta II cDNA resulted in clones that displayed PKC-beta transcript levels similar to or higher than those of the parental HL-60 cells or cells from a PMA-susceptible HL-60 clone, HL-205. These productive transfectants also exhibited PMA-induced cell attachment and spreading, inhibition of cell replication, reactivity to the OKM1 monoclonal antibody, and the ability to phagocytize opsonized beads, which are all characteristic macrophage markers. No PMA-induced differentiation markers were observed in any of the PKC-beta I or PKC-beta II transfectants that did not exhibit an increased PKC-beta RNA level or in cells transfected with control plasmids. These results indicate that restoration of the PKC-beta isozyme deficiency by productive gene transfection causes HL-525 cells to revert to a phenotype like that of the parental HL-60 cells, which is characterized by susceptibility to PMA-induced macrophage differentiation. Therefore, we can conclude that PKC-beta is one of the essential elements in the PMA-induced signal transduction pathway which leads to macrophage differentiation in HL-60 cells and perhaps in other related cell types.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Among these genes, the HSP-70A mRNA and protein levels correlate best with the development and decay of thermotolerance and intrinsic thermal sensitivity. Leukemic and nonleukemic human tumor cells express low levels of the normally heat inducible HSP-70A mRNA in control nonheated cells. Using a competitive quantitative polymerase chain reaction, we have measured the levels of mRNA for this gene and have correlated it with both transient and intrinsic thermal sensitivity of tumor cells. Such studies were also extended to tumor samples obtained from patients. METHODS AND MATERIALS: In these studies, the plasmid phHSP-70 which contains the entire human HSP-70A gene was modified by the insertion of the T7 promoter at the 5'-end untranslated region as well as the insertion of a 23 bp synthetic linker at the BamH1 site in the promoter region of the HSP-70A gene. The PCR primers were located such that the amplified fragment contained the linker. Using the T7 polymerase, the HSP-70A mRNA was transcribed from this plasmid (phHSP-70L) in vitro. A known amount of HSP-70A mRNA was then added to the total RNA prepared from the cell samples or from the tumor tissues obtained from patients. Using the components of the PCR reaction plus known amounts of HSP-70A mRNA synthesized from phHSP-70L and unknown amounts of total cellular RNA, the samples were amplified and analysed on a denaturing acrylamide gel. The PCR products obtained from phHSP-70L were 23 bp larger than the PCR products obtained from the cell samples due to the addition of the synthetic linker to the HSP-70A gene in phHSP-70L and therefore, the two products could be easily distinguished from each other and quantitated. The alpha-32P-dCTP incorporated in each sample was quantitated by AMBIS Scanner. When the 32P-counts were equal in the known and the unknown samples, the amount of the HSP-70A mRNA was taken to be equal in the known and the unknown sample. RESULTS: The results show that HSP-70A mRNA levels can be used to predict the survival levels during the development and decay of thermotolerance. In nonleukemic human tumor cell lines, there are as much as 40-50-fold induction of HSP-70A mRNA levels during the peak of thermotolerance. In leukemic cell lines, however, HSP-70A mRNA levels are induced only by three-fold during the same time period. These differences between the levels of HSP-70A mRNA positively correlate with the amount of tolerance development in leukemic and nonleukemic tumor cells. HSP-70A mRNA levels also vary in different tumor cells under nonheated conditions and there is a positive correlation between HSP-70A mRNA levels in nonleukemic human tumor cells and the level of their intrinsic thermal resistance. CONCLUSION: HSP-70A mRNA levels can be used to predict the intrinsic thermal sensitivity of nonleukemic human tumor cells.","['HSP', 'HSP-70']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Human myeloid HL60 cells were incubated in vitro with 0.74 MBq/mL, 1.48 MBq/mL, or 2.96 MBq/mL of 67Gallium for 4 days. Proliferation (vital cell counts and colorimetric tetrazolium assay), clonogenic survival, and cell-cycle effects were compared with responses of HL60 cells externally irradiated with 0.78, 10.37, and 13.22 Gy by an external 67Gallium source. Dosimetric calculations were performed by Monte Carlo simulations (10,000 events). RESULTS: Proliferation of cells was equally inhibited after 67Gallium incubation with 1.48 and 2.96 MBq/mL compared with 10.37 and 13.22 Gy external irradiation. Irradiation with 10.37 and 13.22 Gy caused a 81% and 89% reduction of Colony Forming Units, compared with 34%, 66%, and 80% reduction after 67Gallium incubation with 0.74, 1.48, and 2.96 MBq/mL, respectively. Peak values for G2/M accumulation were reached on day 4 for the cells externally irradiated with 10.37 and 13.22 Gy (47.5% and 56.7%) and on day 5 after 67Gallium incubation with 0.74 MBq/mL, 1.48 MBq/mL, and 2.96 MBq/mL (26.7%, 43.4%, and 58.2%). CONCLUSIONS: 67Gallium incubation exerts a significant cytotoxic effect on human HL60 cells, which, on the basis of dosimetric studies, may be mainly ascribed to conversion electrons (80 KeV) and 8 KeV Auger electrons. Low energy (< 1 keV) Auger electrons do not contribute significantly. The relative biological effectiveness of 67Gallium compared with external low dose rate gamma irradiation is about 1.0 for clonogenic survival and approximately 1.8 and 1.5 for proliferation inhibition and G2 arrest, respectively. For in vivo therapy, this might implicate that higher doses of 67Gallium than 131Iodine or 90Yttrium are necessary for the same biological effect.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In an attempt to shorten TBI setup and treatment time we aimed to develop a system where the lung blocks are fixed with optimal precision to the build-up booster lucite screen while the patient is immobilized in a reproducible upright position. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Fifteen patients diagnosed with leukemia were conditioned before bone marrow transplant since March 1992. Patients were immobilized in a semistanding position in a special stand with arm bars and hand grips. Treatment was delivered with a 6 MV x-ray horizontal beam. Six fractions of 2.25 Gy (mean instantaneous dose rate of 13.8 +/- 3.8 cGy/min) were delivered twice a day over 3 days (total dose: 13.5 Gy). Each fraction was given in alternating AP (facing the beam) and PA (turning the back) projections. Customized lung blocks (35% transmission) were used to assure a maximum lung dose of 10 +/- 0.5 Gy. The blocks were taped to a 1 cm thick lucite screen interposed between the source and the patient. Lung shields were checked by port films before each fraction. The reproducibility of the patient's positioning (and lung shielding) was evaluated by measuring the horizontal and vertical deviations of the infero-external corners of the lung blocks in the port films in relation to the same point in the simulation films. In vivo dosimetry (thermoluminescence and diodes) was performed by placing dosimeters and probes in the central axis and in several off-axis sites. RESULTS: The mean horizontal and vertical deviations were 3.5 +/- 4.1 mm and 7.5 +/- 5.9 mm for the anterior fields, and 4.1 +/- 4.1 mm and 6.9 +/- 6.4 mm for the posterior fields. An acceptable position of the blocks was considered when deviations were < 5 mm horizontally and/or < 10 mm vertically. The mean time per fraction (i.e., interval between the patient's entering and leaving the treatment room) was 35 +/- 5 min. CONCLUSIONS: A satisfactory level of reproducibility can be reached with this technique. The reasonably short treatment time contributes to reproducibility and patient comfort.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nonhematologic toxicity was not severe; one case of Grade 3 esophagitis, one of reversible adult respiratory distress syndrome, and one radiation pneumonitis. We closed the trial after accrual to the third cohort because of significant myelosuppression. CONCLUSION: This schedule is too myelosuppressive to be used without modification.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PTx (0.1-2 ng/ml) alone was not cytotoxic and did not induce morphological changes in JCS cells. In the presence of a suboptimal concentration of TNF-alpha (25 U/ml), however, PTx (1 ng/ml) acted synergistically in inhibiting proliferation and in inducing monocytic differentiation of the JCS cells. Expression of the macrophage differentiation marker (Mac-1) on JCS cells was increased by the combination of PTx and TNF-alpha, and phagocytic activity of the cells was also enhanced. Moreover, JCS cells treated with PTx and TNF-alpha had reduced tumorigenic capacity in vivo. The data suggest that a PTx-sensitive G protein may be involved in regulating the TNF-alpha-induced monocytic differentiation of the myeloid leukemic JCS cells and that combination of PTx and TNF-alpha may be useful in the treatment of some forms of myelomonocytic leukemia.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The RB protein phosphorylation state is presumed to be an important determinant of cell proliferation or arrest. The cell cycle phase specificity of RB protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation during HL-60 human leukemia cell proliferation and differentiation was determined using DNA-based fluorescence-activated cell sorting and Western analysis. The RB protein in proliferating G1 cells was phosphorylated, but at a relatively low level. The extent of phosphorylation increased in S phase cells and was maximum in G2 + M cells. After the cells were treated with retinoic acid or 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D3, they began to accumulate in G1/0 and phenotypically convert. Significant unphosphorylated RB protein did not appear until after the first cells had arrested and differentiated. Dephosphorylation of the RB protein was first apparent at the beginning of G2 in the remaining cycling cells after onset of arrest and differentiation had already occurred. By the time the remaining cycling cells had divided and arrested, resulting in G0 cells, a majority of RB protein was dephosphorylated, but some remained phosphorylated. The data indicate that dephosphorylation of RB does not determine residence in G1/0. Rather dephosphorylation appears as one relatively late-occurring component of the metabolic cascade culminating in G0-arrested, phenotypically differentiated cells. Dephosphorylated RB appears as a feature of differentiated cells. The data are consistent with a role for hypophosphorylated RB not so much in deriving, but in possibly sustaining the differentiated state.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Cytosine arabinoside (1.0-1.5 g/m2/day) was given as a 5-day continuous infusion to all patients. Four patients with persistent leukemia received a second 3- or 5-day course. The POG protocol included the administration of granulocyte colony stimulating factor for the priming of myeloblasts. Diagnostic criteria for pulmonary insufficiency included noncardiogenic pulmonary edema with exclusion of underlying cardiorespiratory, infectious, or metabolic conditions. Autopsy material also was reviewed. RESULTS: Of the 22 patients 5 died (23%), including 2 who received a second course of Ara-C as a result of pulmonary insufficiency that developed at a median of 8 days (range, 3-38 days) after the first course. Three patients died despite intubation and pressor support. Two patients were managed successfully with colloids, diuresis, and oxygen by face mask; remission was achieved in both. The postmortem examination of one patient disclosed airless lungs, profound pulmonary edema, and subpleural nodules, but no evidence of leukemia. CONCLUSION: Pulmonary insufficiency from high dose Ara-C varies in severity and may be fatal. It may occur during or after treatment.

These events, which were reported infrequently in patients treated only with cytotoxic therapy, may be more common in patients receiving all-trans retinoic acid.

A polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based method was used in this study for investigation of clonal TCR-gamma gene rearrangements in a patient with a classical presentation of angioimmunoblastic lymphadenopathy with dysproteinemia (AILD) that subsequently progressed into an indolent form of dermal T-cell lymphoma. METHODS: TCR gene rearrangements in patients with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) were examined using conventional Southern blot analysis and a newly developed PCR-based technique for clonal TCR gene rearrangements. The oligoprimers amplified rearranged V gamma and J gamma segments (including the N region) of the TCR-gamma gene, and PCR products were resolved using high resolution nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. RESULTS: The authors' results demonstrated good correlation between the two techniques in 10 patients with CTCL (9 patients with C beta and 1 patient with delta 2 rearrangements) and 10 control subjects. The PCR-based technique allowed the authors to detect the presence of an identical T-cell clone in all skin nodules, but not in the original lymph node affected by AILD. CONCLUSIONS: This PCR-based method for detecting clonal TCR rearrangements is a highly sensitive and specific technique for detecting T-cell clones in fresh and paraffin embedded tissues. The presence of a T-cell clone in all skin nodules of this patient, but not in the original lymph node affected by AILD, confirms previous findings that in some cases of AILD, clonal T-cell expansion may not be detectable until a later stage of the disease.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Aiming to elucidate the mechanisms which determine this time-dependent change in target, we infected chick and quail embryos at E3 and E5 with replication-deficient, lacZ gene-carrying, ALV-based viruses produced by a packaging cell line. Three constructs driven by 3 different Long Terminal Repeats (LTRs) were tested and yielded similar results. When the constructs were inoculated at E3 and the lacZ gene product revealed 5 days later, around 70% of the embryos carried lacZ+ clones in the heart, around 50% had positive clones in the skin anywhere on the body, while a few embryos displayed clones in internal organs (liver, stomach, lungs). Immunocytological identification of the heart cell type(s) expressing the virus revealed that the only cells infected were cardiomyocytes. When the constructs were inoculated at E5, no lacZ+ clones appeared in the heart but all were located in the cephalic skin. In order to examine the relationship between viral integration and expression, DNA of different organs or tissues from lacZ stained embryos was analyzed by PCR. A tight correlation between integration and expression in the heart and in the skin was revealed in most cases. In contrast, a significant PCR signal was often detected in the liver or the stomach despite weak or absent expression as revealed by lacZ+ clones. We then investigated the influence of envelope glycoprotein subgroups on the tropism of these constructs. The lacZ vector driven by RAV-2 LTRs was packaged as subgroups A, B or E viral particles. The A subgroup, used in the part of the study described above, infects both chick and quail while the B and E subgroups are specific for chick or quail respectively. These B and E subgroups induced lacZ+ clones in the heart (after E3 injection) while no clones or only a few were detected in the skin either after E3 or E5 injection. The following conclusions can be drawn: 1) cardiomyocytes are at E3 the major target for integration and expression of ALV-derived viruses in vivo; 2) targets change rapidly with embryonic age; and 3) tissue-specific infections depend on the envelope subgroup, thus presumably on the presence of the cognate receptor.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",['lacZ'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Three months after the child's diagnosis, an independent interviewer, using a structured questionnaire, interviewed the parents about what and how they had been told, and assessed the stage of parental coping reached at that time. All patients were treated at a regional paediatric oncology centre (RHSCE) and the interviews were conducted preferably in the family home (61%), or in a 'quiet' hospital room (39%). Twenty-five, unselected, consecutive patients with cancer and leukaemia diagnosed and treated at the RHSCE and their families were recruited into the study (1988-1989). One child died during the first three months and one single parent family refused co-operation. Eighteen of the 23 interviews conducted were with both parents, and five were with single parents (all maternal). All 23 sets of parents admitted deep shock and devastation on hearing the initial diagnosis, with 12 sets feeling that they had taken in little or none of the information given. A long interview was conducted a few days after the initial talk with the consultant. The parents of four children (17%) denied that the long interview had occurred whilst 10/19 who remembered it expressed specific lack of understanding of some or all details. All families remembered a large number (10-20) of subsequent talks with a wide range of staff, but 14/23 felt that some of the information was still confusing or conflicting, and 9/14 did not want to ask for further clarification, principally because they did not want to hear more bad news. The majority felt the child understood little of what was going on. At the study interview, most parents were assessed as still being very anxious about their child's illness, whilst two couples, one single mother and one father, were content with what and how they had been told about their child's illness and were in a state of emotional homeostasis. It is concluded that communication of bad news is a two-way process requiring skilled medical staff, but also a receptive audience. The emotional state of the parent determines his or her ability to hear and comprehend the information given. The results imply that repetition and clarification at consultation interviews is required until parents are emotionally able to hear, accept and comprehend complex news. Written material, taped interviews and simple videos can assist in this process.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A near full-length cDNA clone corresponding to a novel gene located between BAT1 and TNFB that contains sequence corresponding to one of these putative exons, has been isolated from a premonocytic leukaemic cell line cDNA library. Characterization of this gene reveals that it spans 13.5 kb of DNA, with the 3' end of the gene lying approximately 12 kb from the 5' end of the TNFB gene. The cDNA hybridizes to a approximately 1.6 kb mRNA in a number of different cell types, including monocytes, T cells, B cells and hepatocytes. The putative polypeptide encoded by this cDNA is 381 amino acids in length, with a non-glycosylated M(r) of 43214.

The main data come from series of patients who underwent radiotherapy during childhood: a high incidence of tumors of the nervous system is found after irradiation of one to a few grays as treatment of a benign disease (especially tinea capitis), as well as after irradiation at higher doses of a few tens of grays for the treatment of cancer (in particular cerebral irradiation in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia). The type of radiation-induced tumors is variable, but meningioma is more frequent after low doses and glioma and sarcoma after higher doses used in the treatment of neoplastic diseases. A dose-effect relationship appeared between the risk of tumor of the nervous system and the radiation dose. The risk was higher when radiation was delivered at a younger age. Much less data are available after radiotherapy in the adulthood, but an increased risk of cerebral tumor appears in the series of ankylosing spondylitis patients. As for the exposures to radiodiagnosis exams, the main problem is the risk of cerebral tumor in children whose mother has undergone abdominal or pelvic X-rays during pregnancy. No risk of neurologic tumor was found in the A-bomb survivors irradiated at Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Occupational exposure to ionising radiation has been incriminated in the first radiologists exposed to high doses. In nuclear industry workers, the results of epidemiological studies are contradictory and at the present time it is not possible to link their radiologic exposure with a risk of tumor of the nervous system. In populations living near nuclear plants, mortality due to tumors of the nervous system was not increased.",,,,,,,Tumeurs du systeme nerveux radio-induites chez l'homme.,,,,,,,

Sequence analysis showed that RhK562-II is composed of 951 nucleotides (316 amino acids), identical to the first 939 nucleotides (exons 1 to 6) of one of the Rh(D) cDNAs (RhXIII), except for nucleotide 654 (C-->G exchange).

The 1,25(OH)2-20-epi-D3 showed extraordinary activity; at 10(-11) mol/L it inhibited clonal growth of 87% of HL-60 myeloblast cells, 60% of S-LB1 cells (human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 [HTLV-1]-immortalized human T-lymphocyte cell line) and 50% of leukemic clonogenic cells (colony-forming unit-leukemia) obtained from patients with acute myelogenous leukemia. No effect of either 1,25(OH)2D3 or 1,25(OH)2-20-epi-D3 was observed on the clonal proliferation of an HTLV-1-immortalized human T-lymphocyte cell line (Ab-VDR) having nonfunctional 1,25 (OH)2D3 cellular receptors (VDR). The abilities of 1,25(OH)2-20-epi-D3 to induce differentiation of HL-60 cells, as measured by generation of superoxide and nonspecific esterase production, was less than its antiproliferative activities. This analog stimulated colony-forming unit-granulocyte-macrophage growth from normal human bone marrow. To gain insights into the remarkable antileukemic activities of 1,25(OH)2-20-epi-D3, we examined its ability to enter HL-60 cells, bind to the VDR, and interact with a transfected VDRE attached upstream of a TK promoter-driven reporter gene (chloramphenicol acetyl transferase [CAT]). The 1,25(OH)2-20-epi-D3 potently increased CAT activity (> 16-fold, as compared with cells transfected with control receptor having no VDRE); paradoxically, 1,25(OH)2-20-epi-D3 was of equal potency to 1,25(OH)2D3 in transactivating the VDRE-containing reporter gene, even though the analog had a 1,000-fold greater antileukemic effect as compared with 1,25(OH)2D3. In summary, we have identified an extremely potent 1,25(OH)2D3 analog with antiproliferative and differentiating effects on leukemic cells and that may be clinically useful. This analog appears to generate biologic responses via the classical VDR pathway, but further studies are required to elucidate the mechanism by which this analog produces its prominent activities.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have previously shown that all CLL clones express alpha/beta-IFN receptors, but that the resistant cells are defective in the induction of the enzyme 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase (2',5-A synthetase). Thus, the deficiency in IFN sensitivity is localized somewhere between the interaction of the IFN molecule with its receptor and induction of 2',5'-A synthetase. We have now further characterized the resistance of CLL clones to IFN by investigating whether it is associated with a defect in the activation of IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3), which is involved in the activation of alpha-IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). A defect induction of ISGF3 after alpha-IFN treatment was found in 4 of 12 CLL patients. There was a close correlation between defective induction of ISGF3 and a lack of enhancement of 2',5'-A synthetase as well as induction of blast transformation. Pretreatment with gamma-IFN and mixing experiments with extracts from IFN-sensitive cells indicate that a lack of the gamma-component of ISGF3 was the reason for defect in activation in 2 of the patients. We conclude that a defect in activation of ISGF3 is a possible cause for resistance in CLL cells to IFN-induced blast transformation in vitro.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Switch on and off in the upregulation of surface CD23 expression consistently occurs in the early stage of normal B-cell activation, suggesting a key role for CD23 in this process. We show here that, after ligation of mlg in the presence of interleukin-4, the increase of CD23 protein precedes B-cell DNA synthesis and mainly results from the strong induction of CD23 type-B isoform. Exposure of normal B cells to conventional or phosphorothioate-derivatized CD23 antisense oligonucleotides (predominantly type B) significantly augments B-cell proliferation induced by antigen receptor stimulation or direct contact with activated T cells. Unexpectedly, CD23 antisense, but not sense, oligonucleotides specifically enhance rather than suppress CD23 expression on B cells. Finally, a selective increase in CD23 type-B expression provokes the entry of resting (Go) CLL B cells into G1 and S phase of the cell cycle in the absence of any other stimulus, whereas it synergizes with tumor necrosis factor-alpha to increase the number of activated B cells. These results provide compelling evidence that CD23 represents an important molecule directly involved in the process of normal or leukemic B-cell activation and growth.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The simplest vector, LG, in which the GC gene is driven by the viral LTR, was the most efficient vector at infecting HSCs, with an average viral copy number in hematopoietic tissues of 3 copies/cell in recipient mice. In general, the viral vectors that contained any additional promoters or enhancers to drive expression of either the GC gene or a selectable marker gene (Neo) had lower titers and/or transduced HSCs at a lower efficiency. This was seen most markedly when the human phosphoglycerate (PGK) promoter was used to drive the human GC cDNA. Despite repeated attempts to obtain a high titer producer clone, this virus consistently produced low titers and subsequently resulted in the lowest proviral copy numbers in long-term reconstituted mice. Only the viral LTR and PGK promoter were capable of driving significant levels of human GC RNA in hematopoietic cells of long-term reconstituted mice, with a much lower level of RNA generated by an internal herpes TK or SV40 immediate early promoter. Insertion of the internal transcription unit in the opposite orientation relative to the viral LTRs had a detrimental effect on gene expression. The levels of RNA generated by a hybrid LTR containing the myeloproliferative sarcoma virus enhancer were higher in bone marrow-derived macrophages than in nonadherent cells of the bone marrow when compared with the LG vector. The presence of an internal promoter to drive expression of the human GC cDNA did not seem to have a detrimental effect on expression levels from the viral LTR. In fact, in the presence of an internal TK or PGK promoter expression from the LTR was increased despite the presence of lower proviral copy numbers. Insertion of a second gene (Neo) into the vector had a negative impact on long-term expression in hematopoietic cells in vivo; however, this seems to be due solely to the lower transduction efficiency of this vector. Overall, the highest levels of GC activity in macrophages of long-term reconstituted mice were generated by the LG vector; however, these levels were variable.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Enl is a nuclear protein that is capable of activating transcription from synthetic reporter genes in both lymphoid and myeloid cells, as well as in yeast. Deletion mutagenesis demonstrated that the minimal portion of Enl required for activation of transcription was localized to its C-terminal 90 amino acids. This region is highly conserved between Enl and the t(9;11) fusion partner Af-9 and is retained in all Hrx-Enl and Hrx-Af9 fusion proteins. Thus, the leukemogenic contribution and transcriptional activation potential of Enl colocalize to its highly conserved carboxy terminus, suggesting that Hrx-Enl chimeric proteins mediate alterations in the transcription program of t(11;19)-bearing cells.","['ENL', 'HRX']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two other issues that continue to be debated include the increasing recognition of the value of lactate dehydrogenase-1 for identifying poor-risk patients, and the benefits of referral to a unit specializing in testicular cancer. There is an increasing trend to use high-dose chemotherapy for previously untreated patients who have poor risk factors. who have poor risk factors.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Consistent with previous studies, prenatal X-ray exposure was found to be associated with an 80% increased risk of childhood cancers, although the estimation was based on 4% and 2% exposed cases and controls and was only marginally statistically significant (P = 0.08). Post-natal X-ray exposure was also linked with a small elevation in the risk of all cancers and the major categories of malignancies in children. Little evidence, however, was found to relate parental preconception X-ray exposure with the subsequent cancer risk in offspring, regardless of the exposure window and the anatomical site of X-ray exposures. This study adds further to the growing literature indicating that antenatal ultrasound exposure is probably not associated with an increased risk of childhood cancer.",,PMC2033354,,,,,,,,,,,,

Some clinicians seek a greater survival benefit by increasing the intensity of the dose, whereas others lower it to diminish toxicity. METHODS: The Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) conducted a randomized trial of different levels of doses and dose intensity (dose per unit of time) of adjuvant chemotherapy in 1572 women with node-positive, stage II breast cancer who were assigned to three treatment groups. One group received 400 mg of cyclophosphamide per square meter of body-surface area and 40 mg of doxorubicin per square meter once every 28 days and 400 mg of fluorouracil per square meter twice every 28 days, for six cycles. Another group received 50 percent higher doses of the three drugs (600 mg, 60 mg, and 600 mg, respectively) but for only four cycles, so that the total dose was identical in these two groups but the dose intensity was higher in the first. The third group of women received half the total dose used in the other two groups and at half the dose intensity used in the second group. RESULTS: After a median of 3.4 years of follow-up, the women treated with a high or moderate dose intensity had significantly longer disease-free survival (P < 0.001) and overall survival (P = 0.004) than those treated with a low dose intensity, in three-way log-rank comparisons. However, the difference in survival between the two groups treated with a moderate or high dose intensity was not significant. These results are consistent with either a dose-response effect or a threshold level of the dose or dose intensity. CONCLUSIONS: The doses of chemotherapy used to treat breast cancer, especially early breast cancer, should not be reduced if the maximal benefit is to be achieved.",,,,"['N Engl J Med. 1994 May 5;330(18):1308-9.

A series of six mutant p53 genes were cloned from relapse T-ALL-derived cell lines and were constructed into defective retroviral expression vectors. Viruses encoding mutant p53 proteins were used to infect relapse T-ALL cells in a study designed to compare their pathogenic potency. The mutant p53 genes possessed a distinct hierarchy in vivo and in vitro: mutants inducing the greatest increase in proliferation of different T-ALL lines in vitro and colony formation in methylcellulose cultures also induced tissue invasiveness of infected T-ALL cells in vivo. Mutant p53 gene transfer to a cell line lacking p53 protein showed that the more potent p53 mutants possessed a distinctive dominant oncogenic activity in vitro and in vivo. The dominant oncogenic activity of these mutant p53 proteins was not dependent on the presence of and on complex formation with wild-type p53 protein. These ""hot"" p53 mutations thus represent bona fide gain-of-function mutations. Infection of p53-negative T-ALL cells with viruses encoding gain-of-function mutant p53 genes resulted in the acquisition of metastatic potential and tissue invasiveness.

Our findings are compatible with the hypotheses that 1) apoSAA gene expression in human monocytes/macrophages in vivo is differentiation dependent; 2) activated macrophages provide a local source of apoSAA at sites of tissue injury or inflammation; 3) apoSAA is induced in tissue macrophages by local stimuli, under conditions that may not evoke the systemic acute phase response.","['apoSAA1', 'apoSAA2', 'apoSAA4']",PMC1890325,,,,['GENBANK/UNKNOWN'],,,,,,,,

Mcl-1 is a recently discovered gene whose encoded protein has significant homology with Bcl-2 but whose function remains unknown. In this study, we compared the in vivo patterns of Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 protein production in normal and neoplastic lymph node biopsies by immunohistochemical means using specific polyclonal antisera. Intracellular Mcl-1 immunoreactivity was located primarily in the cytosol in a punctate pattern and was also seen in association with the nuclear envelope in many cases, similar to the results obtained for Bcl-2, which resides in the outer mitochondrial membrane, nuclear envelope, and endoplasmic reticulum. In 4 of 4 reactive tonsils and 28 of 28 nodes with reactive follicular hyperplasia, reciprocal patterns of Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 protein expression were observed. Bcl-2 immunostaining was highest in mantle zone lymphocytes and absent from most germinal center cells, whereas Mcl-1 immunoreactivity was highest in germinal center lymphocytes and absent from mantle zone lymphocytes. Mcl-1 was also expressed in some interfollicular lymphocytes, particularly those that had the appearance of activated lymphocytes. Similar to the patterns of Bcl-2 and mcl-1 expression seen in reactive nodes, Mcl-1 protein was largely absent from the malignant cells in 2 of 2 mantle cell lymphomas, whereas strong Bcl-2 immunostaining was found in these cells. In contrast to normal nodes, however, the neoplastic follicles of t(14;18) containing follicular non-Hodgkin's lymphomas immunostained positively for both Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 in 24 of 27 cases. Intense immunostaining for Mcl-1 was also observed in Reed-Sternberg cells in 2 of 2 cases of Hodgkin's disease but Bcl-2 immunoreactivity was present at much lower levels. These findings demonstrate that the levels of Mcl-1 and Bcl-2 proteins are differentially regulated in normal and neoplastic cells in lymph nodes and thus suggest different roles for these proteins in the control of cell life and death in these tissues.",,PMC1890333,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we show that genomic sequences adjacent to Fli-2 correspond to the coding region of the erythroid-specific DNA binding protein NF-E2 p45. In one erythroleukemia cell line the expression of NF-E2 p45 is undetectable due to proviral integration in one allele and loss of the other allele. The complete loss of NF-E2 p45 in this cell line is associated with a drastic reduction in expression of the alpha- and beta-globin genes that were partially restored by reintroduction of the NF-E2 p45 gene. Taken together, these results provide direct evidence that NF-E2 gene is essential for globin transcription and suggest that perturbation in expression of this transcription factor may contribute to erythroleukemia progression.",,PMC44613,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, such responses are rarely durable when conventional postremission therapy is administered. Uncontrolled trials have suggested that intensive postremission therapy may prolong these complete remissions. METHODS: We treated 1088 adults with newly diagnosed AML with three days of daunorubicin and seven days of cytarabine and randomly assigned patients who had a complete remission to receive four courses of cytarabine at one of three doses: 100 mg per square meter of body-surface area per day for five days by continuous infusion, 400 mg per square meter per day for five days by continuous infusion, or 3 g per square meter in a 3-hour infusion every 12 hours (twice daily) on days 1, 3, and 5. All patients then received four courses of monthly maintenance treatment. RESULTS: Of the 693 patients who had a complete remission, 596 were randomly assigned to receive postremission cytarabine. After a median follow-up of 52 months, the disease-free survival rates in the three treatment groups were significantly different (P = 0.003). Relative to the 100-mg group, the hazard ratios were 0.67 for the 3-g group (95 percent confidence interval, 0.53 to 0.86) and 0.75 for the 400-mg group (95 percent confidence interval, 0.60 to 0.94). The probability of remaining in continuous complete remission after four years for patients 60 years of age or younger was 24 percent in the 100-mg group, 29 percent in the 400-mg group, and 44 percent in the 3-g group (P = 0.002). In contrast, for patients older than 60, the probability of remaining disease-free after four years was 16 percent or less in each of the three postremission cytarabine groups. CONCLUSIONS: These data support the concept of a dose-response effect for cytarabine in patients with AML who are 60 years of age or younger. The results with the high-dose schedule in this age group are comparable to those reported in similar patients who have undergone allogeneic bone marrow transplantation during a first remission.",,,,"['N Engl J Med. 1995 Feb 2;332(5):334; author reply 334-5.

The major peroxidase in bone marrow is myeloperoxidase (MPO), which has been previously thought to be expressed at the promyelocytic stage of differentiation. Hematopoietic progenitor cells are important potential cellular targets of bone marrow toxins and leukemogens. We therefore examined peroxidase activity in both murine and human progenitor cells. Murine progenitor populations were purified as lineage-negative cells (> 99% enriched) and human progenitor populations were purified as CD34+ cells (> 95% enriched). Using conventional biochemical assays for peroxidase activity, murine and human progenitor cells were found to have 30% and 11% of the peroxidase activity of murine and human unpurified marrow, respectively. Peroxidase activity was confirmed in purified murine and human progenitor populations by flow cytometry using a 2,7-dichlorofluorescein assay, adapted to measure peroxidase activity. In addition, two-color flow cytometry of murine whole marrow using phycoerythrin-conjugated antibodies to lineage markers confirmed the peroxidase activity of the murine progenitor cell population. A reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assay was developed for MPO mRNA, which was detected in murine progenitor cells. These data show that MPO mRNA is expressed in murine progenitor cells and that both murine and human progenitor cells have marked peroxidase activity. These data may have relevance for studies of hematopoietic cell differentiation and for the examination of mechanisms underlying cell-specific toxicity in bone marrow.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Drug Rev. 11:165-179 (1993)] has been cloned from a human placenta library. This clone, known as Hup-4, encodes a protein of 358 amino acids that has only approximately 30% overall identity with other PG receptors, including mouse and human clones that have been designated as EP2 receptors [J. Biol. Chem. 268:7759-7762 (1993); Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 197:263-270 (1993)]. In COS-7 cells transfected with Hup-4, PGE2 stimulated the formation of cAMP with an EC50 of approximately 50 nM. The EP2-selective agonists AH13205 and butaprost were also active, with EC50 values in the range of 2-6 microM. The order of potency of PGs for competition with binding of [3H]PGE2 to membranes prepared from COS-7 cells transfected with Hup-4 was PGE2 > or = PGE1 > 16,16-dimethyl-PGE2 > or = 11-deoxy-PGE1 > butaprost > AH13205 > 19(R)-OH-PGE2. Natural PGs and analogues that are selective for the FP (PGF2a), DP (PGD2), EP1 (sulprostone), EP3 (MB 28767), and EP4 (1-OH-PGE1) receptors were inactive or competed poorly with the binding of [3H]PGE2 (< 50% displacement of specific binding at 10 microM). Northern blot analysis showed the presence of a Hup-4 message of approximately 3.1 kilobases in mRNA from human lung and placenta. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction studies also indicated that Hup-4 is probably expressed in human uterus and in HL-60 (human promyelocytic leukemia) cells. Our findings suggest that Hup-4 encodes the pharmacologically defined EP2 receptor, whereas the mouse and human cDNAs previously classified as EP2 may represent another EP receptor subtype or the recently defined EP4 subtype [Prostaglandins 47:151-168 (1994)].",,,,,,['GENBANK/U19487'],,,,,,,,

Nineteen months after the start of chemotherapy, she complained of palpitations, and anemia and thrombocytopenia developed. The myelogram revealed 41.2% leukemic cells, and a diagnosis of t-ANLL induced by VP-16 was made. The karyotype of bone marrow cells showed 46, XX, t(7;11) (p13;p15), 16p+. She obtained complete remission (CR) by treatment with low dose cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C) and cytarabine ocfosfate (SPAC). Karyotype with t-ANLL induced by alkylate agents frequently shows unbalanced abnormalities. The difference of cytogenetic findings suggest the difference of mechanisms. Detailed chromosomal analysis make clear the oncogenesis of t-ANLL. It is reported that the prognosis of patients with t-ANLL treated by conventional chemotherapy is poor. Considering that elderly cases of acute leukemia have a lower probability of achieving CR than non-elderly cases, because of complications and side effects of chemotherapy such as bone marrow suppression, treatment with low dose Ara-C and SPAC is thought to be indicated in elderly patients with t-ANLL.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Clinical findings showed decreased level of gamma-globulin (IgG, IgA and IgM were all decreased markedly), hypercalcemia, renal dysfunction and increased serum beta-2 microglobulin. The peripheral blood leukocyte count was 30,100/microliters with 64% plasma cells, and 80.4% plasma cells were also observed in the bone marrow. Only light chain-kappa was detected in plasma cells by an immunohistochemical staining method, but immunoelectrophoresis showed no M-bow either in serum or urine. Electron microscopy revealed typical plasma cells with prominently developed rough endoplasmic reticulum. From these results, the diagnosis of non-secretory primary plasma cell leukemia was established. He was treated with VEP-IFN-alpha regimen, and plasma cells decreased markedly in both peripheral blood and bone marrow. Serum immunoglobulin recovered to within the normal range.

A continuous spectrophotometric assay was used to measure the kinetic parameters of substrate hydrolysis by PR14. Several peptide substrates containing HTLV-1 sequences known to be cleaved by PR14 were used. Cleavage analysis showed that the affinity with which PR14 binds these substrates is higher than that previously reported for HTLV-1 Gag peptides. Also, the affinities of peptides containing the sites involved in autocleavage of protease from its precursor are higher than for the peptides containing sites required for structural protein maturation. This suggests that the autocatalysis of protease from its own precursor has priority over other cleavage reactions and supports similar observations of an ordered hierarchy of processing events by retroviral proteases. As the N- and C-terminal regions of retroviral aspartic proteases are known to contribute to stability of the dimer by forming antiparallel beta-strands, short peptides corresponding to these terminal sequences of HTLV-1 protease were tested for their ability to inhibit cleavage of substrates by PR14. Inhibition was seen with a C-terminal peptide corresponding exactly to the C-terminal 11 amino acids of the processed PR14, whereas a peptide containing a sequence situated further from the C terminus was less effective. An inhibitor of the protease of human immunodeficiency virus type 1, Ro 31-8959, was found to be a poor inhibitor of PR14.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Human infection usually occurs as a result of inoculation of the organism through the body surface, thus causing skin infection, onychomycosis, keratitis, endophthalmitis and arthritis. Dissemination may occur in subjects with underlying immunodeficiency. Among immunocompromised hosts, Fusarium sp. is an emerging pathogen in neutropenic patients. To our knowledge, since 1973, when the first disseminated fusariosis in a child with acute leukemia was reported, about 80 new cases have been reported, mainly occurring in patients with haematologic malignancies. Specific portals of entry are not well understood, nevertheless the respiratory tract, colonised gastrointestinal tract, onychomycosis, disrupted skin barrier and central venous catheter have been reported as entry sites of deep seated Fusarium infections. Fever, positive blood cultures, severe myalgias, disseminated ecthyma gangrenosum-like skin lesions, ocular symptoms and multiple-organ-system involvement are distinctive features in most cases of disseminated fusariosis. The prognosis is very poor with death generally following despite antifungal therapy, unless an increase in the white blood cell count occurs. All available antifungal drugs show a low activity against the various species of Fusarium. Nevertheless, amphotericin B seems to have the highest in vitro activity and, even if it does not appear to be effective in persistently neutropenic patients, it should be currently considered to be the treatment of choice.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because T cell depletion is the only effective way to prevent GVHD it seems important to understand whether effective GVL can develop after BMT with T cell depletion in GVHD-free recipients. Well-established C57BL/6-->BALB/c chimeras that were free of GVHD, reconstituted with T cell-depleted allogeneic bone marrow cells, and inoculated 3 mo after BMT with a high inoculation of murine B cell leukemia (BCL1) showed no evidence of disease, whereas all control mice developed leukemia and died within 58 days. Results from adoptive transfer experiments in secondary naive BALB/c recipients indicated that all BCL1 cells were eliminated in the chimeras within 14 days. Hence, complete resistance to BCL1 developed in the chimeras despite complete tolerance to host alloantigens. The GVL effects observed in tolerant chimeras were further amplified by administration of immunocompetent allogeneic C57BL/6 spleen cells, low dose rIL-2, or both for 5 days. Our data suggest that GVL effects can develop even after T cell depletion in the absence of clinically overt GVHD and that GVL can be further amplified by rIL-2, either with or without use of additional immunocompetent donor T cells. Our data may provide the basis for new approaches to induce effective GVL after allogeneic BMT with cell therapy and rIL-2 at the stage of minimal residual disease, while avoiding early GVHD induced by the BMT procedure.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using a recently cloned human leukemic cell line (FLG 29.1 cells) we demonstrate that these cells synthesize and secrete TGF-beta 1 and that exogenous or autocrine TGF-beta 1 can induce the same features of osteoclastic-like cells, exerting its effects through the binding to TGF-beta specific receptors. Scatchard analysis of 125I-labeled TGF-beta 1 to FLG 29.1 cells revealed the presence of a single high affinity binding site with a Kd value of approximately 25 pM and a binding capacity of approximately 900 sites/cell. Affinity labeling experiments showed that FLG 29.1 cells express type I and type II TGF-beta receptors. Stimulation of FLG 29.1 cells with low TGF-beta 1 doses reduced cell proliferation and increased cell adhesion and tartrate resistant acid phosphatase (TRAcP) activity. Pretreatment of FLG 29.1 cells with TGF-beta 1 caused a significant and dose-dependent response to calcitonin. Northern blot of total mRNA and analysis of the conditioned media (CM) showed that TGF-beta 1 was synthesized by FLG 29.1 cells. TPA treatment, which induces partial differentiation of these cells, markedly increased TGF-beta 1 mRNA expression and growth factor release. The majority of TGF-beta 1 secreted by TPA-treated cells was in its latent form. However, anti-TGF-beta antibodies inhibited TGF-beta 1 and TPA-induced growth inhibition, calcitonin responsiveness, and TRAcP activity, suggesting that the TPA effect is mediated in part by autocrine TGF-beta 1 and indicating that the cells can activate and respond to the TGF-beta that they secrete. These findings support a potential autocrine role for TGF-beta 1 in osteoclast differentiation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It was found that the proteins expressed from constructs with partial deletions in the cytoplasmic domain were transported to the Golgi complex at a significantly slower rate than G1. Although a major fraction of these proteins was eventually transported to the Golgi complex, they did not exhibit as clearly defined a pattern of accumulation as G1, but rather appeared to be distributed throughout the endoplasmic reticulum as well as the Golgi complex. The proteins expressed from constructs lacking most of the cytoplasmic domain and, in some cases, part of the transmembrane domain sequences as well were transported to the cell surface.

We show that the bHLH proteins do not mediate activation, but instead mediate repression of gene expression in the presence of Tax. We further show that a consensus bHLH binding site in the promoter of the beta-polymerase gene, which encodes an enzyme involved in DNA repair, mediates the previously reported repression of beta-polymerase gene expression by Tax. Together, these results suggest that Tax may induce malignant transformation, at least in part, through bHLH-mediated repression of key cellular regulatory genes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have investigated the phenotypic changes and the T-cell-stimulatory capacity of EBV-infected B-CLL cells. One aliquot of CLL cells was infected with EBV, another was activated with a mixture of Staphylococcus aureus (SAC), IL-2 and the supernatant from the T-cell hybridoma MP6 (activation mixture, AcMx) and the third aliquot received both treatments. In accordance with the individual features of the clonal populations represented by each patient, the immunophenotypic changes imposed by these treatments differed. With the samples of 3 patients the allo-stimulatory potential showed the following ranking order: EBV and AcMx-treated cells > AcMx-treated > EBV-infected. An analysis of several activation-related surface markers and adhesion molecules on the cells did not reveal any association between their expression and the EBV-imposed potentiation of allostimulatory capacity. These results may be extrapolated to EBV-genome-carrying normal B cells, suggesting that they can persist in vivo only as long as they have the resting phenotype. Once they are activated, these cells may be recognized and eliminated by T lymphocytes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The investigation was carried out with the use of the double immunocytochemical test employing anti-nuclear (Ki-67) and line-specific monoclonal antibodies on peripheral blood lymphocytes, those of lymph nodes and bone marrow obtained from 40 patients with lymphoproliferative diseases and on the cells of lymphoblastoid line 501. The disease variant was classified according to the WHO criteria. The highest (> 60%) proliferative activity of lymphoid cells was found in the bone marrow in acute non-T non-B lymphoblast leukemia and in lymph node in T-cell and non-T non-B-cell lymphoblast lymphosarcoma. A broad range in the number of proliferative cells existed among B-cell lymphosarcomas of lymphoblast (12-73%) and prolymphocytic (0-91%) variants. Together with heterogeneous immunological phenotype, this reflects a wide spectrum of various nosological entities recognized by the WHO classification as lymphoblast and prolymphocytic variants of lymphosarcoma, says about the defects of the above classification. Extremely low (< 1%) percent of proliferative cells was observed in B-cell chronic lymphoid leukemia and hairy-cell leukemia. These differences in tumor cell proliferative potential in different lymphoproliferative diseases agree with the views on maturation and differentiation of lymphoid cells. The data obtained by the authors support the necessity of correcting routine histological data by immunological characteristics of pathological lymphoid cells, primarily, by introduction of data on cell proliferative activity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",,,,,,,Otsenka proliferatsii i lineinoi prinadlezhnosti limfoidnykh kletok pri razlichnykh limfoproliferativnykh zabolevaniiakh dvoinym immunotsitokhimicheskim metodom.,,,,,,,

The detrimental effects of substitutions of several of these conserved spacer and loop 2 nucleotides in the murine leukemia virus sequence show their importance for the read-through process. The importance of specific nucleotides in loop 2 of the pseudoknot contrasts with the flexibility of sequence in loop 2 of the most intensively studied frameshift-promoting pseudoknot which occurs in infectious bronchitis virus.

Cytogenetic approaches, such as G-banding karyotypes, micronuclei (MN), chromosome aberrations (CA), fragile sites (Fra), cell cycle time (Tc), sister chromatid exchanges (SCE), silver-staining nucleolar organizer regions (Ag-NOR), and silver-staining acrocentric chromosome satellite association (Ag-AA), were investigated on 19 presently healthy members of the family, compared with 10 normal controls. The results showed that their G-banding chromosome karyotypes were normal, without a single similarly located fragile site being found to be carried commonly by the blood relations, although the rare fragile site frequency in the blood relations group was higher than that in the non-blood relations group or normal controls. On the other hand, SCE and Ag-NOR were lowered in the blood relations. In III-13 and IV-3 of the pedigree, in particular, the prolonged cell cycle time with distinctly abnormal SCE and Ag-NOR might predict a high risk for leukemia.

These regulators include cytokines now called colony stimulating factors (CSFs) and interleukins (ILs). Different cytokines can induce cell viability, multiplication and differentiation, and hemopoiesis is controlled by a network of cytokine interactions. This multigene network includes positive regulators such as CSFs and ILs and negative regulators such as transforming growth factor beta and tumor necrosis factor. The cytokine network which has arisen during evolution allows considerable flexibility depending on which part of the network is activated and the ready amplification of response to a particular stimulus. The CSFs and ILs induce cell viability by inhibiting programmed cell death (apoptosis). Programmed cell death is also regulated by the genes wild-type and mutant p53, c-myc and bcl-2, and suppression or induction of this program can result in tumor promotion or tumor suppression. Cytokines that regulate normal hemopoiesis can control the abnormal growth of certain types of leukemic cells and suppress malignancy by inducing differentiation. Genetic abnormalities that give rise to malignancy in these leukemic cells can be by-passed and their effects nullified by inducing differentiation and programmed cell death. The hemopoietic cytokines discovered in culture are active in vivo and are being used clinically to correct defects in hemopoiesis.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These IL-6 family cytokines exhibit a similar helical structure, and their receptors are structurally similar and constitute a cytokine receptor super family. In addition, a receptor subunit is shared among these IL-6 related cytokine subfamily receptors, contributing to one of the mechanisms of functional redundancy of cytokine activities and suggesting the presence of a common signal transduction pathway among these receptors. In this review, we describe the structure of the receptors for IL-6 and its related cytokine subfamily members. Furthermore, we propose a novel mechanism for the generation of cytokine diversity, i.e. the complex of a cytokine and one of its receptor subunits act as a novel cytokine on the cells that express the other receptor subunit(s) capable of acting as a receptor for the complex. Finally, we describe a Ras-independent novel signal transduction pathway that utilizes Jak tyrosine kinase family, Stat protein family and yet unidentified H-7-sensitive pathway. This signal transduction pathway is commonly generated through the receptors for a wide range of cytokines and growth factors.","['c-fos', 'junB']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The main benefits are earlier recovery of neutrophils resulting in fewer days with fever, antibiotics and hospitalization. Growth factors were found to reduce the treatment-related morbidity and to improve the practicability of therapeutic regimens. First studies on a prospective chemotherapy dose intensification supported by growth factors are underway. As a further effect of growth factors, an attempted enhancement of antitumor cytotoxicity by recruitment of tumor cells to chemosensitivity or by modulation of antitumor drug metabolism appears realistic based on first data on growth factor priming in AML. New ways to support high-intensity and myeloablative antitumor strategies are opened by the autologous transplantation of peripheral blood progenitor cells mobilized by growth factors and also by the use of new factors like SCF and the synergistic combination of growth factors as part of future strategies against malignant disorders.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The proportion of cells with DNA strand breaks prior to therapy, most likely reflecting spontaneous apoptosis, varied from 0.1 to 16%, but in the large majority of cases was below 3%. Administration of drugs of different classes, which included DNA topoisomerase I (Topotecan) and II (mitoxantrone, VP-16) inhibitors, antimetabolite (ara-C) or microtubule poison (Taxol), all triggered the appearance of cells with extensive DNA breakage, typical of apoptosis, to up to 80%. The peak of the response, measured as maximal percent of cells with DNA strand breaks, which varied between individual patients by as much as factor 10, was generally seen between 8 to 24 h after the initial administration of DNA topoisomerase inhibitors, and somewhat later (48-72 h) during the response to Taxol or ara-C. Thus, the data show that the response to treatment with a variety of drugs, in terms of induction of apoptosis, can be conveniently measured by the present method.

Two types of T cell antigen receptors (TCR alpha beta and TCR gamma delta) have been described whose expression at the cell surface of T cells is exclusive. V(D)J rearrangements are clone specific and occur irrespective of antigens during the early stages of lymphoid differentiation. In rare instances, recombination occurs between different Ig/TCR loci or even involve genes distinct of those coding for Ig or TCR.

The other two scorings aimed respectively: 1) to discriminate between B-CLL from all other B-cell disorders which evolve with leukemia and 2) distinguish between hairy cell leukaemia (HCL), HCL-variant and splenic lymphoma with villous lymphocytes, a group of B-cell diseases with circulating ""hairy"" lymphocytes.

The transplant is limited to a minority of relatively young patients (aged below 55 years) with an HLA-identical sibling. Allogeneic BMT may also be considered when a closely- or fully-matched unrelated donor has been identified for a young and fit patient. All patients, including those without an excess of blasts, should be conditioned with bone marrow ablative therapy rather than an immune suppressive regime, such as cyclophosphamide alone. For the majority of patients there is no standard therapy other than appropriate supportive care. Relatively young patients below the age of 60 years with poor risk features can be considered for treatment with combination chemotherapy. Maintaining remission after remission-induction chemotherapy is a difficult issue. Patients not eligible for allogeneic BMT could be treated with post-remission chemotherapy or autologous BMT in the framework of prospective studies. Older patients can be considered for treatment with haematopoietic growth factors alone or in combination with differentiating agents such as low-dose Ara-C.

This inhibitory effect is observed after an incubation of 1 hour with both 1 and 10 microM aldehyde. Moreover, we report that down-regulation of c-myc expression increases when repeated additions of 1 microM 4-hydroxynonenal are performed, to maintain the cells in presence of aldehyde for 7.5 hours.

Inhibition of the biosynthesis of these isoprenylated proteins results in a decrease in DNA synthesis and a characteristic G1 blockade of the cell cycle. This inhibition can be achieved by incubation of cells in the presence of a hydroxy-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitor (lovastatin) and can be reversed by addition of exogenous mevalonate. When incubated in the presence of lovastatin, L1210 wild-type cells are not inhibited at G1 but rather progress to a G2/M blockade, which is reversible with exogenous mevalonate. Thymidine incorporation has also shown that DNA synthesis is occurring until this blockade is achieved. However, when L1210 cells resistant to cisplatin are incubated in the presence of lovastatin, the characteristic G1 cell cycle blockade and DNA synthesis inhibition occur. The understanding of this mechanism and the role that isoprenylated proteins play in the regulation of DNA synthesis and cell cycle progression may gain great insight into the abnormal control of the cancer cell.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Studies on the glycosaminoglycan pattern of the proteoglycans showed that PMA treatment initiated a shift in glycanation of the MDS-proteoglycans from the predominant chondroitin sulphate-proteoglycans in control cells to a predominant heparan sulphateproteoglycans in adherent cells. These data indicate that protein kinase C, the main target of PMA, may have a profound role in the regulation of glycanation pattern of proteoglycans. Furthermore, such alterations in the cellular proteoglycans may significantly affect the matrix adhesion potential of hematopoietic cells.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Human multipotent K562 cells were induced by DOX and ACM to differentiate towards the erythroid lineage. After 3 days of culture, DOX-induced differentiation was dose-related whereas ACM did not require total cell growth arrest to induce its optimum effect, indicating that both drugs act differently on the coupling of growth and differentiation. Simultaneous exposure to ACM and DOX and sequential exposure to ACM (30 min) first, followed immediately by DOX did not improve erythroid differentiation. However, it led to either a synergistic or a subadditive inhibition of cell growth. In contrast, DOX (30 min) first, followed by ACM, produced in a narrow range of concentrations (DOX 1000 nM/ACM 1.85 nM, 3.75 nM or 7.5 nM), a synergistic induction of differentiation. Thus, DOX 1000 nM/ACM 3. 75 nM resulted in 81% of differentiated cells compared to 63% for ACM 15 nM and 43% for DOX 30 nM when these were used alone (at their concentration inducing optimum differentiation).

To study the mechanism of the differentiation of human leukemia ML1 cells induced by bufalin, we measured the effect of 10 nM bufalin on cell growth, activities of various protein kinases, and cell cycle. The ML1 cell growth was inhibited significantly at 24 hr and the inhibiting effect persisted for 6 days. Activities of PKC, PKA, cdc2 kinase and CK II in ML1 cells were changed early by bufalin; PKA and PKC activities were inhibited, and cdc2 kinase and CK II activities were increased. These results suggest that bufalin induces differentiation of ML1 cells by modulating several protein kinase activities in a distinct way from RA and 1 alpha, 25(OH) 2D3. Cell cycle changes, measured by flow cytometry, became evident at 12 hr after treatment of ML1 cells with bufalin and the cells were preferentially arrested in the G2/M phase. This effect of bufalin on the cell cycle of leukemia cells is similar to that of topoisomerase inhibitors. Indeed, the activity of topoisomerase II but not topoisomerase I of ML1 cells was inhibited remarkably by the treatment of the cells with 10 nM bufalin.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, in other tumours (e.g., the acquired cisplatin resistant ADJ/PC6 plasmacytoma) non-GSH mediated mechanisms of resistance (such as enhanced DNA repair) probably account for the resistance. Pretreatment of animals with oral buthionine sulfoximine (BSO), which resulted in approximately 70% depletion in tumour GSH levels, failed to potentiate the antitumour efficacy of either cisplatin (using the ADJ/PC6 and L1210 models) or the 1,2-diaminocyclohexane (DACH) platinum-drug, tetraplatin (using the ADJ/PC6 model).

However, cases of Sweet's syndrome in the agranulocytosis stage are exceptional (7 in the literature). CASE-REPORT: We report the case of a woman with acute myeloblastic leukaemia who had presented with Sweet's syndrome in the phase of therapeutic aplasia during induction of treatment, in the absence of white blood cells transfusion or treatment with haematopoietic growth factor (GM CSF, GCSF). COMMENTS: the physiopathology of Sweet's syndrome is unknown. Various mechanisms have been suggested, including immune reaction type III, increased interleukin-1 synthesis, increased chemotaxis of neutrophils, action of haematopoietic growth factors, iatrogenic effect of some drugs (e.g. cotrimoxazole, furosemide or minocycline). Yet none of these mechanisms involving circulating polymorphonuclears or their bone marrow precursors can explain the occurrence of Sweet's syndrome in the phase of agranulocytosis. CONCLUSION: the diagnosis of Sweet's syndrome must be considered in patients with agranulocytosis in order to avoid ineffective antibiotics and to initiate a corticosteroid therapy that will accelerate the cure of this benign dermatosis.",,,,,,,Dermatose aigue febrile neutrophilique (syndrome de Sweet) en periode d'agranulocytose therapeutique au cours d'une leucemie aigue myeloblastique (LAM).,,,,,,,

We developed a simple, rapid, and selective procedure for extraction of the degraded, low-molecular-weight DNA from apoptotic cells. The cells are prefixed in 70% ethanol, DNA is extracted with 0.2 M phosphate-citrate buffer at pH 7.8, and the extract is sequentially treated with RNase A and proteinase K and then subjected to electrophoresis. The ladder pattern was detected from DNA extracted from 1-2 x 10(6) HL-60 cells, of which as few as 8% were apoptotic, by flow cytometric criteria, as well as from blood and bone marrow samples from leukemic patients undergoing chemotherapy. The method is rapid and uses nontoxic reagents (no phenol, chloroform, etc.). This approach permits the analysis of DNA extracted from the very same cell population that is subjected to measurements by flow cytometry to estimate DNA ploidy, the cell cycle distribution of nonapoptotic cells, the percentage of apoptotic cells, or other parameters. Furthermore, the cells may be stored in 70% ethanol for at least several weeks before analysis without any significant DNA degradation. Treatment with ethanol also inactivates several pathogens, thereby increasing the safety of sample handling. The method is applicable to clinical samples, which can be fixed in ethanol and then stored and/or safety transported prior to analysis.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Controls were men with cancers other than those of the central nervous system or leukemia. Magnetic field measurements on workers in each electrical occupation and in a random sample of occupations presumed to be nonelectrical were used to estimate magnetic field exposures for each occupation. Among men in electrical occupations, 121 leukemias were diagnosed. With the exception of electrical engineers, magnetic field exposures were higher among workers in electrical occupations than in nonelectrical occupations.

Analysis of this system continues to provide opportunities for further insight into mechanisms underlying some of the essential characteristics of neoplastic change including maturation arrest, prolonged cell survival, and genetic instability. The deregulation of c-myc expression induced by nearby proviral integration appears to initiate preneoplastic change in a specific window of development, i.e., the bursal stem cell. The generation of large numbers of these preneoplastic stem cells, and the ability for further amplification by transplantation technology, may provide an opportunity to address questions such as how and why myc oncogenes produce preneoplastic maturation arrest or why stem cells are selective targets for these effects. Among the unexplained consequences of this preneoplastic state appears to be genetic instability which leads, inevitably, to formation of invasive bursal neoplasms. It is at least conceivable that the observed myc-induced enhancement of the remarkable capacity for apoptotic cell death present in bursal cells plays a role in this instability. DNA strand breakage is a very early feature of bursal cell apoptosis. If such breakage could occur in sublethal form it might provide a mechanism for increased frequency of genetic change (deletions, rearrangement, and recombination). Among the changes that seem required for successful tumor cell growth outside of follicles is the suppression of cell death induced by loss of cell-cell contact which is characteristic of normal and preneoplastic bursal cells. Several genes in the bcl-2 family are potentially important in the modulation of cell death events central to the evolution of these neoplasms. Their role, if any, remains to be established.",['c-myc'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

For successful antimycotic treatment, a knowledge of preferential underlying disease, frequency, species and site of the mycosis is of importance. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Postmortem material comprising clinical data, autopsy protocols and histological sections obtained between 1976 and 1990 from 1,053 patients with leukaemia and malignant lymphomas following antineoplastic therapy was analysed retrospectively. RESULTS: Autopsy revealed systemic mycoses in 184 patients (17.5%). Between 1976 and 1990, the incidence of fungal infections increased from 12% to 30%, most being found in acute leukaemia (24%). Myeloproliferative syndrome (18%), non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (16%), Hodgkin's disease (10%) and plasmocytoma (2.5%) were less frequently associated with mycoses. With no preference for any particular malignancy in evidence, aspergillosis predominated at histology (85 cases), while candidosis occurred in 75 cases. A combination of two mycoses (aspergillosis and candidosis) (14 patients), zygomycosis (eight patients) and cryptococcosis (two patients) were much less common. While aspergillosis caused mostly pulmonary (81 cases) and cerebral (18 cases) infections, candidosis most frequently affected the GI tract (83 cases). The fungal infection was regarded as the main cause of death in some 76% of the cases. An analysis of bone marrow of patients with mycosis (184 cases) revealed a predominance of hypoplasia (54%) over tumour infiltration (34%) and normal bone marrow (12%). In malignancies with no mycoses (869 cases) in contrast, hypoplasia was significantly less common (19%) than infiltration (59%) or normal bone marrow (22%) (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The incidence of mycoses in haematological neoplasias in our post mortem series has continued to increase. Bone marrow hypoplasia in particular predisposes to fungal infection. The lungs are the organs of predilection, and aspergillosis is likely to be the infection presenting.",,,,,,,Systemische Pilzinfektionen bei hamatologischen Neoplasien.

Of the remaining 22 patients (71.0%) none met the criteria for psychiatric disorders. Of the five patients who knew their true diagnoses, three were assessed as having adjustment disorder with depressed mood and one as having major depression. Also, among the five patients on chemotherapy, four met the criteria for psychiatric disorders. Adjustment disorders were fewer among Japanese patients with malignant hematological diseases than among patients from previous studies in western countries, which can be explained by the patients' defense mechanism such as 'denial' and/or the less frequent 'truth-telling' in Japan.

Here, we report that fusion proteins containing the Src homology 2 (SH2) domains of Syk and Lyn precipitated tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins from RBL-2H3 cell lysates. There was no detectable precipitation with the N-terminal Syk SH2 domain, minimal with the C-terminal Syk SH2, and strong when the two SH2 domains were expressed in tandem. The Syk SH2 domains showed pronounced selectivity in the binding of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins. Thus, Syk SH2 precipitated only three phosphoproteins, two of which were the beta and gamma subunits of Fc epsilon RI. In contrast, the fusion protein with Lyn SH2, in addition to precipitating the same Fc epsilon RI components, bound to many other phosphoproteins. Tyrosine phosphorylation of the beta and gamma subunits of Fc epsilon RI was essential for their precipitation with the SH2 fusion proteins. By direct binding studies, there was more binding of Syk SH2 to Fc epsilon RI gamma than to Fc epsilon RI beta, whereas Lyn SH2 bound only to Fc epsilon RI beta. The Syk SH2 fusion protein competitively inhibited the association of gamma and beta with Syk in lysates of activated cells. The SH2-mediated association of these two protein tyrosine kinases with Fc epsilon RI could play an important role in receptor signaling.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While immunoelectron microscopy has identified the nuclear membrane as the site at which 5-LO, as well as 5-LO activating protein (FLAP), are localized in activated cells, the locale of soluble 5-LO in unstimulated cells could not be established by this technique. We asked whether the nucleus might also be the site for soluble 5-LO in unstimulated cells, and utilized rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) cells as model granulocytic cells to address this question. Using three different techniques to disrupt cells while leaving nuclei intact (mild nitrogen cavitation, Dounce homogenization, and detergent lysis), immunoblot analysis indicated abundant 5-LO in isolated nuclei. Within purified nuclei, 5-LO existed in two pools: a soluble pool that was readily released upon nuclear disruption and a bound pool that was not removed by 300 mM NaCl treatment. In all cases, 5-LO was also found in cytosolic and non-nuclear membrane fractions. Indirect immunofluorescent microscopy confirmed the presence of abundant 5-LO within the nucleus with minimal extranuclear signal in most cells. However, a minority of cells, characterized by condensed chromatin, showed no nuclear-associated staining with increased cytoplasmic staining for 5-LO. This suggested that some of the cytosolic 5-LO found by cell fractionation resulted from these dividing cells. When the contribution from dividing cells was minimized, either by overnight serum deprivation or by isolating cytoplasts of nucleus-containing cells, 5-LO was prominent in the nuclear fraction but negligible in the cytosolic fraction. In contrast to this distribution in RBL cells, 5-LO in unstimulated human neutrophils was predominantly cytosolic, by both immunoblot and immunofluorescence analyses. In both RBL cells and human neutrophils, FLAP was localized at the nuclear membrane and the endoplasmic reticulum. These data provide the first evidence for the localization of 5-LO in unstimulated granulocytic cells. The finding that a substantial proportion of enzyme is localized within the nucleus of unstimulated RBL cells suggests potentially novel roles for 5-LO or its products within the nucleus.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A systematic survey of the literature and autoptic evaluation of the larynx in a relatively small number of patients with systemic lymphoreticular malignancies yielded the following findings: Primary tumors of the larynx must be clearly distinguished from laryngeal involvement by systemic or leukemic infiltrations. By far the most common primary hemopoietic tumors of the larynx are extramedullary plasmacytoma (about 90 cases published) and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL; about 65 cases published). Primary Hodgkin's disease, granulocytic sarcoma and mast cell sarcoma are extremely rare at this site. Plasmacytoma and NHL both preferentially involve the supraglottis. The subglottis is infrequently affected. Laryngeal plasmacytoma and NHL usually present clinically as localized stage IE and IIE tumors that exhibit no significant tendency to recur or generalize. The therapy of choice is local irradiation while chemotherapy should be reserved for recurrent or progressive disease. Prognosis is favorable in most cases of primary laryngeal plasmacytoma and NHL. Secondary involvement of the larynx by systemic lesions or leukemic infiltrations is usually associated with a very poor prognosis. The prognosis of patients with laryngeal involvement in acute or chronic myeloid leukemia is always poor. Although the histopathological diagnoses given in many case reports are often difficult to compare because of differences in terminology, there seems to be a marked preponderance of B-cell tumors of high-grade malignancy (centroblastic or immunoblastic lymphoma in the Kiel classification of NHL) that probably represents lymphomas originating from mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",,,,,,,Der Kehlkopf bei lymphoproliferativen und myeloproliferativen Erkrankungen.

The consistent finding in five epidemiological studies of workers occupationally exposed to butadiene is excess mortality from lymphohaematopoietic malignancy. This highly reproducible finding is noted despite methodological limitations in each of the published studies that tend to diminish the likelihood of observing an etiological association: (i) lack of detailed data on individual exposures to butadiene; and (ii) increasing longevity of many patients with lymphohaematopoietic malignancies, owing to treatment with modern therapeutic regimens, which results in their not being included in analysis of mortality. The observed excess in cancer mortality is most clearly evident in subpopulations heavily exposed to butadiene: production and maintenance workers as well as African-American workers. These epidemiological data strongly suggest an etiological association between exposure to butadiene and human cancer. The data amply fulfil all of Bradford Hill's criteria for causality. It is reasonable to conclude that there now exists convincing evidence for the carcinogenicity of butadiene to humans. Styrene. Epidemiological data on styrene suggest the possibility of an association with lymphohaematopoietic malignancy, although the finding has not been consistent. The most recent epidemiological study, an analysis of 35,000 European workers, suggests, however, an association between these malignancies and time elapsed since first occupational exposure to styrene. Preliminary data from a nested case-control study within the cohort also suggest an association with cumulative exposure to styrene. Although the current classification of the human carcinogenicity of styrene within the IARC Monographs programme appears to be reasonable, if the new findings are confirmed it may become necessary in the near future to revise the classification. Downgrading of the IARC classification is clearly contraindicated in light of current epidemiological and toxicological data.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since the presence of large numbers of unexposed workers could conceal risks within a cohort, a case-control study was designed to examine the relationship between estimated exposures and the occurrence of these cancers. The results suggested that the risk for leukaemia was associated with exposure to butadiene and with work in specific areas. Modelling, using rank scores, indicated an increase in the risk for leukaemia with increasing exposure score. Use of cases validated by review of hospital records and selection of a new set of controls did not change the findings. The data indicated that comparison of scores within the same time frame improved the model and increased the estimated odds ratio, suggesting that exposure time or dose rate may prove to be the important variable for risk. Exact measurements from the companies involved showed significant correlations between assigned ranks and level of exposure derived from personal monitoring for butadiene but not for styrene. Thus, use of the measured values might be expected to show an association between leukaemia and exposure to butadiene. The standardized mortality ratio for leukaemia among long-term workers hired before 1960 who had worked in the three plants where the geometric mean butadiene level was three to five times higher than those in the other plants is 1.8 times higher than that of the US population.

Some support was thus found for previous reports of increased risk for respiratory cancers and for malignancies of the lymphatic and haematopoietic tissues. The results must be interpreted with caution, however, owing to shortcomings in the design of the study.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Exposure to styrene was reconstructed through job histories, environmental and biological monitoring data and production records of the plants in the study. Cause-specific national death rates were used as the reference. Among exposed workers, no excess was observed for mortality from all causes (2195 deaths, standardized mortality ratio [SMR], 95; 95% confidence interval [CI], 91-99), from all neoplasms, from lung cancer or from other major epithelial cancers. Mortality from neoplasms of the lymphatic and haematopoietic tissues was not elevated (50 deaths; SMR, 96; CI, 71-126) and was not consistently associated with length of exposure. The rate of mortality from leukaemias and lymphomas increased with time since first exposure.

However, the duration of remission is brief and is associated with a progressive decrease in peak plasma concentrations following chronic dosing. 9-Cis-retinoic acid (9-cis-RA) has the potential to elicit the same effects as tr-RA, because it can bind and activate the same family of nuclear receptors. It is not known whether the pharmacokinetics of this novel compound resemble those of tr-RA. In this study, we report major differences in the uptake and pharmacokinetics between orally administered tr-RA and 9-cis-RA in the plasma of nude mice. Following a single initial oral administration of either isomer, the plasma peak time of 9-cis-RA (15-30 min) occurred earlier than that of tr-RA (60-180 min), but with lower plasma concentrations and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) value. A decrease in the AUC of plasma tr-RA was seen in animals that were given a second dose 2 days after the first dose. In contrast, an increase in the AUC of plasma 9-cis-RA was seen in animals that were given a second dose 2 days after the first dose. This increase was due to the appearance of a second 9-cis-RA peak at 180 min. When liarozole, an inhibitor of tr-RA metabolism, was coadministered with the initial tr-RA dose or a second tr-RA dose 2 weeks later, the AUC of plasma tr-RA was increased relative to tr-RA alone.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This formed a rationale to move teniposide and/or etoposide to front-line therapy of childhood ALL. The superior results projected for our last trial, an overall cure rate of about 75%, are attributable in part to early use of epipodophyllotoxins. This class of agents is also used extensively in the treatment of newly diagnosed childhood solid tumors, including neuroblastoma, medulloblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, and germ-cell tumors.

A major problem with assessing topoisomerase II activity in clinical materials is the marked heterogeneity of the enzyme among the cells and the associated high proportion of tumor cells which are not traversing the cell cycle.

It is also one of the important agents in the preparatory regimens given prior to bone marrow and peripheral stem-cell rescue. Despite its high degree of efficacy in a number of malignancies, the optimal dose, schedule, and dosing form remain to be defined. It is possible that continuous or prolonged inhibition of the substrate, i. e., topoisomerase II, may be the key factor for the cytotoxic effects of etoposide. Clinical studies have shown the activity of etoposide to be schedule-dependent, with prolonged dosing, best accomplished by the oral dosing form, offering a therapeutic advantage. This benefit awaits validation by prospective randomized studies, some of which are in progress. Recent clinical investigations have focused on the use of etoposide in combination with (a) cytokines to ameliorate myelosuppression, the dose-limiting toxicity of etoposide; (b) agents such as cyclosporin A and verapamil to alter the p-glycoprotein (mdr1) function; and (c) topoisomerase I inhibitors to modulate the substrate upon which it acts. There is continued interest in the development of etoposide to its maximal clinical dimensions and in the examination of alternative biochemical and mechanistic approaches to further our understanding of this highly active agent.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

J. Cell Biol. 44:238-246]. We observed an early (20-30 min) stage of spreading in which F-actin was organized into peripheral arcs near the spreading margin and vinculin was localised to the cell's periphery at the ends of these arcs. By 1 h the cells were well spread with straight actin bundles many of which ended at more central sites terminating on patches containing vinculin and talin; thus the cells assemble typical stress fibers but do not appear to polarize. The cells also spread on RGD polymer. DiC8 (1,2-dioctanoyl-sn-glycerol, C8:0, Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) induced spreading but only if DAG kinase inhibitor and A-23187 were also present; in their absence cells adhered but did not spread. Spreading was approximately 85% inhibited by 100 nM staurosporine. PKC-beta was shown to be present in the cells by immunoblotting. In cells spread for 1 h with PMA, F-actin increased to 180% of control levels as measured by RP binding and the actin sequestering complex of G-actin-thymosin beta 4 decreased significantly. To determine whether the F-actin increase required adhesion, we inhibited cell attachment to the substratum by adding RGDS, by coating glass surfaces with hemoglobin, or by a combined treatment. Under these conditions PMA-treated suspended cells still increased their F-actin to 126-137% of controls, a significant increase over control levels. Staurosporine inhibited F-actin increases under all the conditions studied. Permeabilized cell suspensions, incubated with rhodamine labelled G-actin, incorporated the labelled actin along cell membranes at a low level. A few minutes preincubation with either diC8 plus DAG kinase inhibitor or with PMA strongly increased the incorporation. This increased incorporation was reduced to below control levels by either staurosporine (100 nM) or cytochalasin D (1 microM). We conclude that both suspended and spreading HEL cells can be stimulated to polymerize actin by a mechanism dependent on PKC or a PKC-like molecule. In suspended cells, the polymerization occurs along the membrane. When cells spread, F-actin increased to a significantly greater extent. This second step could involve additional polymerization, perhaps at the observed adhesion sites, decreased turnover of the actin bundles, or a combined effect of both mechanisms.",,,,,['Cell Motil Cytoskeleton 1994;28(4):359'],,,,,,,,,

We show that IL-1 enhances considerably and transiently, with the maximum level between 1 and 2 hr after stimulation, the expression of IL-2 mRNA in the PHA-stimulated cells. The level of IL-2 mRNA declined rapidly within 4 to 6 hr after stimulation in both PHA- and PHA plus IL-1-stimulated cell cultures. On the contrary, IFN-alpha does not elevate the level of IL-2 mRNA above the level in PHA-stimulated cultures, but maintains an enhanced level of IL-2 mRNA in the activated cells for more than 6 hr after stimulation. These observations correlate well with the kinetics of IL-2 protein production into the culture media. The results thus suggest that IL-1 and IFN-alpha may exert an enhancing effect on IL-2 production by distinct mechanisms.

We found that treatment of human leukemic lymphoblasts (CCRF-CEM) with teniposide (VM-26), under conditions that stabilize DNA-topoisomerase II complexes, caused the formation of internucleosomal DNA ladders. However, it appeared unlikely that the VM-26-stabilized DNA-topoisomerase II-cleavable complexes directly produce these internucleosomal DNA ladders, since similar nucleosomal DNA ladders were observed following either continuous or a short (1 h) exposure of cells to VM-26. Under continuous exposure to VM-26, the internucleosomal DNA ladders were associated with the transient induction of c-jun mRNA in a dose-dependent fashion, reaching maximum expression at 6 h after treatment with VM-26 and being down-regulated to basal levels by 12 h. The induction of c-jun mRNA by VM-26 apparently preceded DNA ladder formation. However, in CEM sublines selected for resistance to VM-26 (CEM/VM-1 and CEM/VM-1-5; approximately 50- and 140-fold resistant, respectively) and which display the phenotype of multidrug resistance associated with altered DNA topoisomerase II (at-MDR), we found that the induction of c-jun mRNA by VM-26 and subsequent DNA ladder formation were progressively attenuated in proportion to the resistance of the cells, apparently due in part to decreased stabilization of DNA-topoisomerase II-cleavable complexes. Further, the attenuated induction of c-jun in the at-MDR cells was found to be associated with a decreased rate of c-jun transcription and an increase in the instability of its mRNA following VM-26 treatment. The attenuation of c-jun mRNA induction was also reflected in decreased production of c-Jun protein in the at-MDR cells. Of interest was the fact that no significant induction of c-fos mRNA by VM-26 was observed in either CEM or at-MDR cells. Furthermore, the induction of c-jun was related to the activation of AP-1 DNA-binding activity in a time- and dose-dependent manner in CEM cells, whereas the activation of AP-1 binding was attenuated in at-MDR cells in proportion to their resistance to VM-26. Using Jun and Fos family member antibody inhibition experiments in gel-mobility shift assays, we found that AP-1-binding activity appeared to be preferentially mediated by c-Jun/Fra-1 heterodimers in both CEM and at-MDR cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['c-fos', 'c-jun', 'c-myc']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

It became apparent that this type of information was present in the magnetic resonance spectra from intact viable lymphocytes in the late 1970s. It was not until the 1980s, however, that one-dimensional multipulse sequences were used to filter the large signal contributions from water and fat, which had until then masked weaker signals from other molecules. When this technology was combined with two-dimensional spectroscopy, unambiguous assignment of the biologically relevant chemical species became possible. In vitro activated, stimulated, transformed, and malignant lymphocytes, as well as embryonic fibroblasts and malignant cells of epithelial origin, all gave rise to a strong triglyceride spectrum and resonances from a multitude of cellular metabolites. Two-dimensional spectroscopy and the analyses of highly purified membranes determined that the triglyceride signals originated, at least in part, from the plasma membrane. Based on physiochemical data, a new model for the structural arrangement of plasma membrane lipid in these cells was proposed. While differences exist between the proton magnetic resonance spectra of stimulated lymphocytes and malignant cells in vitro, they share a high-resolution lipid spectrum. In tissue, however, the presence of activated lymphocytes does not always produce the lipid spectrum, particularly in the vicinity of tumors.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cells primed in vivo were triggered in vitro during NMR analysis and the results were compared to those from chemiluminescence tests performed simultaneously. Three preliminary phases were achieved: (i) 31P and 13C NMR spectroscopy of perchloric acid extracts, (ii) optimization of culture and perfusion conditions with validation of macrophage viability and functionality, and (iii) development of a data processing technique to improve the time resolution of kinetic studies. Based on their phosphocreatine content, cells primed in vivo exhibited maturation than control cells. After the respiratory burst of primed macrophages was triggered by concanavalin A, 31P NMR spectra reflected both a transient increase in ADP phosphorylation and intracellular acidification. 13C NMR studies indicated an acceleration of metabolism following in vitro triggering.

The aplastic phase is often transient and remission may be spontaneous or rapidly induced by steroid, and followed a few months later by acute leukaemia. This modality of presentation may be observed in up to 2-3% of all cases of paediatric ALL. A 13-year old girl who presented with two spontaneously reversible episodes of marrow aplasia has been reported recently. She developed ALL 8 months later.

BFU-E has CD34, CD41a (platelet glycoprotein[GP]IIb/IIIa) and CD41b(GPIIb) antigens. Paired daughter cells derived from BFU-E have CD41a, CD41b, CD71 (transferrin receptor) and HLA-DR antigens, but not CD34 or CD33 antigen. The CD36 antigen (thrombospondin receptor or GPIV) is first expressed on the cells after 5 days of culture, in agreement with the report that the anti-CD36 positive fraction contained a greater part of the erythroid colony-forming units (CFU-E). The blood group A antigen is first expressed on cells from aggregates derived from BFU-E after 5 days of culture. Glycophorin A is expressed on cell surface after 7 days of culture when proerythroblasts first appear. Hemoglobin alpha is expressed after 8 days of culture and coincides with the first appearance of basophilic erythroblasts. This review provides useful information on the identification of leukemic cells from poorly differentiated acute leukemias such as early erythroblastic leukemia and acute megakaryoblastic leukemia, and is useful in the understanding of the commitment and differentiation of erythroid and megakaryocytic progenitors in normal hematopoiesis.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The target cells of AMKL and TAM are immature cells close to stem cells which are capable of differentiating into lineage cells such as megakaryocytes, erythrocytes and myeloid cells.

Annexin VIII was originally found to be a vascular anticoagulant, but evidence obtained from our recent studies suggests that it does not play a role in hemorrhage diathesis in APL. The specific expression of annexin VIII in APL may relate to its possible role in hematopoietic cell differentiation. The expression of annexin VIII is developmentally regulated in APL-derived NB4 cells. It can be downregulated as a response to induction by ATRA, an agent which is also capable of inducing maturation of NB4 cells. Our current understanding is that annexin VIII is most likely involved in signal transduction and may have a role as a modulator of PKC. A change in cellular PKC activity is expected to have a significant impact on cell differentiation and proliferation. The biological function of annexin VIII is currently unknown, but its expression in APL and its possible role in differentiation and proliferation of the leukemia cells would provide an excellent model system to study and elucidate this intriguing question.","['PML-RAR &agr;', 'RAR &agr;', 'VAC-&bgr;']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

CASE SUMMARY: A 23-month-old child with acute myeloblastic leukemia developed symptoms compatible with RMS while receiving oral vancomycin for suspected Clostridium difficile colitis. Serum concentrations of vancomycin, measured at the time of the clinical episode, demonstrated significant oral absorption of the drug. Serum concentrations of vancomycin decreased later, implying a possible decrease in absorption, after the patient's neutrophil count returned to normal. The child later experienced another clinical episode compatible with RMS while vancomycin was being administered intravenously for suspected sepsis. DISCUSSION: There is no published report of RMS following oral administration of vancomycin. The reaction described took place while the child was neutropenic. Because of the absence of any significant renal function alteration that could explain the importance of the serum concentrations observed, we assume that C. difficile, neutropenia-, and chemotherapy-associated colitis may have resulted in extensive intestinal lesions, leading to an increased amount of vancomycin being systemically absorbed. This increased absorption during profound neutropenia may have been sufficient to exceed a purported threshold, leading to RMS. CONCLUSIONS: This case demonstrates that significant absorption of vancomycin may occur in neutropenic patients with normal renal function, and that it may be accompanied by RMS, usually associated with rapid infusions or large parenteral doses of the drug.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A polyclonal anti-C1q-R antibody recognizes a 68-kD neutrophil surface protein. C1q-R expression was not upregulated upon warming, priming, or exposure to FMLP, but decreased after exposure to phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), because of shedding of the receptor into the extracellular medium, as detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. CR3 and CR1 expression was upregulated from intracellular pools after cell stimulation by PMA. No evidence of intracellular pools of C1q-R was found, as assessed by immunoblotting of subcellular fractions. But C1q-R appeared to be expressed early in cell differentiation, was detected on undifferentiated HL-60 cells, and like CR3 expression, increased upon 5 days differentiation towards a neutrophil lineage. However, C1q-R expression decreased upon additional culture, whereas CR3 expression continued to increase. A large variation in the percentage of peripheral cells expressing C1q receptors in donors was observed, ranging from 13% to 100%, contrasting with CR3 receptors that exhibited less variability. Interactions between free monomeric C1q and neutrophils were also studied. Incubation of stimulated neutrophils with 10 to 100 micrograms/mL C1q resulted in a further increase in CR3 expression and adherence to albumin-coated surfaces. Staphylococci opsonized with low quantities of C1q (0.1 to 1 microgram/mL) mediated a moderate and sustained respiratory burst in neutrophils, whereas a burst of similar magnitude was generated only with free C1q at concentrations 10- to 100-fold higher. Stimulation was only partially inhibited if cells were first treated with anti-C1q-R antibody, suggesting other C1q binding proteins may be present on the cell surface. In summary, neutrophil C1q receptor is approximately 68-kD, exhibits varying expression on different subjects, and is not upregulated from intracellular stores on exposure to soluble stimuli. Stimulated, but not resting, neutrophils selectively respond to raised levels of free C1q, resulting in altered cell function and enhanced CR3 receptor expression. These studies thus suggest complex roles for C1q in neutrophil function.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Neoplastic cells may have special needs for vitamin C. Therefore, we investigated the transport of vitamin C in a human myeloid leukemia cell line (HL-60). The HL-60 cells lacked the capacity to transport the reduced form of vitamin C, ascorbic acid, but they showed a remarkable ability to transport the oxidized form of vitamin C, dehydroascorbic acid (DHA). Uptake-accumulation studies indicated that the HL-60 cells accumulated ascorbic acid when provided with DHA. Kinetic analysis showed the presence of two functional activities involved in the uptake of DHA, one with low affinity and one with high affinity. Cytochalasin B and phloretin, which inhibit the passage of glucose through the facilitative glucose transporters, also inhibited the transport of DHA by HL-60 cells. Transport of DHA was completed by D- but not L-hexoses, and was sensitive to D-hexose-dependent counter transport acceleration. These data support the concept that HL-60 myeloid leukemic cells transport DHA through the facilitative hexose transporters (glucose transporters) and accumulate the reduced form of ascorbic acid.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Moreover, ATP content and BCL-2 gene expression were inversely correlated with glucocorticoid sensitivity and cell cycle length. In resistant cell lines, sensitivity to dexamethasone was restored by the mitochondrial inhibitors rotenone and meta-iodobenzylguanidine. This sensitization was not accompanied by detectable reductions in bcl-2 mRNA or protein content, suggesting that the inhibitors were capable of overriding BCL-2-mediated inhibition of apoptosis.

Addition of > or = 50 ng/mL of AcSDKP to LTCs of normal cells at the time of the regular weekly half-medium change selectively and reversibly decreased the proportion of high proliferative potential erythroid and granulopoietic progenitors in the adherent layer that were in S-phase without changing their numbers, but had no effect on either the cycling activity or number of analogous (neoplastic) cells in the adherent layer of CML LTCs. Specificity of the effect of AcSDKP on primitive normal progenitors was demonstrated by the finding that a similar addition of either the control peptide, AcSDKE, or 100 ng/mL of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha, which contains the SDKP sequence), or SDKP itself (at 300 ng/mL) did not inhibit the proliferation of primitive normal progenitors in LTC adherent layers. Incorporation of > or = 30 ng/mL of AcSDKP (but not the related control peptide, AcSDKE) directly into methylcellulose cultures of normal marrow cells resulted in a dose-dependent suppression of colony formation, which was not seen in similar studies with CML marrow or after removal of adherent cells from normal marrow. Additional experiments showed that the inhibitory effect of AcSDKP on primitive normal progenitor cycling in the LTC system could be overcome by the simultaneous addition of macrophage inflammatory protein-1 beta (MIP-1 beta); an antagonist of MIP-1 alpha. The apparent differential effect of AcSDKP on primitive normal and CML progenitors may thus be a secondary consequence of the differential responsiveness of these cells to MIP-1 alpha for another molecule antagonized by MIP-1 beta), whose production or release by adherent marrow cells is inducible by AcSDKP. Such a mechanism may offer a method for obtaining localized increases in vivo of cytokines like MIP-1 alpha, suggesting novel and perhaps less toxic strategies for protecting primitive normal progenitors during repeated treatments with cycle-active chemotherapeutic agents where escalating the dose of drug given would be desirable.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A vector was constructed containing the coding sequences for beta-galactosidase (beta-gal), including a nuclear localization signal, under the control of a strong viral promotor. Infectious vector particles were prepared by cotransfection of the vector plasmid with a second plasmid that contained the coding sequences for AAV proteins into adenovirus-infected human embryonic kidney cells.

Positive immunoselection yielded a population of enriched CD34+ cells that were transduced with the rAAV beta-gal vector. Nuclear localized enzyme expression was documented in 60% to 70% of infected cells. Progenitor-derived colonies that developed after 2 weeks in clonogenic cultures were shown to have viral-associated DNA at an estimated copy number of 1 to 2 per cell using a semiquantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method. Integration of AAV into hematopoietic progenitors was documented using wild-type virus, as its genome may integrate at a preferred site on chromosome 19.

These BM adherent cells produce hematopoietic growth factors constitutively or inducively and support developing hematopoietic cells. To elucidate the ability of cytokine production by BM adherent cells, the cytokine levels of the culture supernatant of BM adherent cells were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Constitutive production of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) by the unstimulated BM adherent cells was demonstrated. Levels of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) were below detectable levels (< 10 pg/ml). The IL-6 level was significantly increased in the co-culture supernatant with KG1 cells or U937 cells (P < 0.01: P < 0.05, respectively). Even when the adherent cells and cell line cells were separated by a membrane filter, the IL-6 level was significantly higher than the control culture (P < 0.01). Co-culture with these cell lines was supposed to induce the increased production of IL-6, which was mediated by some soluble cytokines. The GM-CSF level was not increased in the supernatant co-cultured with any of the cell lines, except with K562 cells. However, K562 cells alone secreted a detectable level of GM-CSF and the increased level of GM-CSF was considered to be due to the production of GM-CSF by K562 cells. G-CSF was not detectable in the supernatant co-cultured with any cell line cells. This result indicates that the cytokine production was regulated by the interaction of BM adherent cells and some leukemic cells.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A combination of tTAuP and cisplatin (CDDP) is shown to be more active than either agent alone. Intracellular accumulation studies analysed by SXRF have shown that to achieve a cytotoxic effect, large concentrations of gold are necessary to accumulate in both the nuclear and cytoplasmic fraction. However, at cytostatic doses (1 microM), tTAuP has no effect on the cell cycle but does affect DNA synthesis. At a higher dose, greater than that necessary to induce cytotoxicity, it produces DNA damage, as observed by alkaline elution method. When cells were exposed to toxic doses of tTAuP (10 microM) in the presence of albumin, cytotoxicity was significantly reduced. Similar results were obtained when cells were co-treated with L-cysteine, dithiothreitol or reduced gluthatione. Reduced cytotoxic effect can be related to the interaction with free thiol groups. According to these data it is concluded that tTAuP is highly effective in vitro; whether it is active in vivo remains to be determined.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is characterized by progressive lymphoproliferation, profound immunodeficiency, and the subsequent loss of resistance to opportunistic pathogens, including intestinal pathogens. Cellular and/or humoral immunity of gut-associated lymphoid tissues may play a key role in the elimination of these pathogens. We have previously demonstrated reductions in the number of mucosal T and B cells in MAIDS. In this study, the cytokine production by mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN) cells and their proliferative response to mitogens during MAIDS were investigated. Alterations were observed in the kinetics of MLN cell proliferation and cytokine secretion by in vitro mitogen-stimulated MLN cells during the retrovirus infection. Cytokine production was abnormally changed, with a gradual decrease in interleukin-2 (IL-2) production as well as an increase in IL-5 and IL-6 secretion. Interferon-gamma production was increased during the progression to MAIDS. The dysregulated release of cytokines by MLN cells due to retrovirus infection could lead to immune dysfunction. These data indicate that dysregulated cytokine secretion by MLN cells may be responsible for impaired mucosal immunity in AIDS, explaining the dramatic increase of opportunistic intestinal pathogens in individuals with AIDS.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we show that the 3-fold increase in c-jun transcripts in K/VP.5 cells was accompanied by a 2-fold increase in the stability of the mRNA for this gene and a nearly 2-fold increase in AP-1 DNA binding activity compared with parental K562 cells. Treatment of K562 and K/VP.5 cells with 50-200 microM VP-16 resulted in 3- to 10-fold stimulation of c-jun transcripts, which peaked 90-150 min after addition of drug and remained elevated up to 5 hr. In contrast, amsacrine stimulated the levels of c-jun mRNA only 3-fold in both cell lines, and its c-jun stimulatory effects were decreased at concentrations greater than 50 microM. VP-16 stimulation of c-jun mRNA levels resulted in a 2-fold increase in AP-1 binding activity in K562 but not in K/VP.5 cells. Taken together, these results suggest that posttranscriptional changes in c-jun mRNA regulation may be associated with acquired resistance to VP-16.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The relationships between the agonist-, TG- and CPA-sensitive Ca2+ pools were investigated with optimal concentrations of these agents in Ca(2+)-free medium. CPA failed to release Ca2+ after the Ca2+ stores of the cells had been discharged by TG, and vice versa, suggesting that the TG- and CPA-sensitive pools exactly overlap. Using this protocol, it was further demonstrated that (a) histamine and ATP utilized the same agonist-sensitive pool, and (b) the CPA- or TG-sensitive pool was much larger than, and encompassed, the agonist-sensitive pool. Although optimal (30 microM) CPA treatment for 5 min totally emptied the agonist-sensitive pool, a brief exposure (1.5 min) to a sub-optimal concentration (3 microM) of CPA, which only slightly raised cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i), substantially enhanced subsequent agonist-induced Ca2+ release. Brief pretreatments with sub-optimal concentrations of TG or ionomycin, which caused moderate [Ca2+]i elevation, also caused such enhancement. However, sub-optimal CPA pretreatment had no prominent effect on Ca2+ release, which was InsP3-independent: it did not enhance TG-induced Ca2+ release, and only relatively weakly augmented ionomycin-induced Ca2+ release. Our results represent a novel observation showing that low concentrations of CPA, TG and ionomycin can potentiate subsequent agonist-induced Ca2+ release, and suggest that a 'priming' moderate [Ca2+]i elevation can amplify subsequent InsP3-dependent Ca2+ release in HL-60 cells.",,PMC1137194,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cases were obtained from a population-based cancer registry in western Washington state, and controls were obtained from the same area by random digit dialing. Of 32 electrical home appliances for which data on use were available for adult acute nonlymphocytic leukemia cases and controls, three motor-driven personal appliances (electric razors, hair dryers, and massage units) were selected a priori because their use represents exposure to higher peak magnetic fields than that from most other home appliances. When compared on an ""ever used"" versus ""never used"" basis, use of one or more of these appliances was not associated with increased risk of leukemia in the population studied (odds ratio (OR) = 0.71, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.41-1.24). When the appliances were considered individually, massage units were more likely to have been used by cases than by controls (OR = 3.00, 95% CI 1.43-6.32), while hair dryers were more likely to have been used by controls than cases (OR = 0.38, 95% CI 0.22-0.66). There was a nonsignificant tendency for electric razor use to differentiate the cases from controls (OR = 1.33, 95% CI 0.80-2.23). When reported daily time of use was stratified, there was no overall increased risk with increased time of use except for electric razors (p < 0.05). In addition to the analysis of appliance use data from the case-control study, the authors obtained several models of these motor-driven personal appliances and characterized the magnetic fields they produce. Magnetic field flux density, or the B-field, and spectral measurements showed that partial body exposure from such appliances may exceed 0.5 mTesla (root mean squared) at rates-of-change exceeding 10 Tesla/sec. These epidemiologic data must be interpreted cautiously because the number of cases is limited and because of proxy reporting of appliance use for deceased cases. Nevertheless, the authors believe these data indicate that peak magnetic field exposure from personal appliances warrants further investigation as a possible risk factor for acute nonlymphocytic leukemia in adults.",,,,"['Am J Epidemiol. 1996 Apr 1;143(7):743-4.

We have reassessed this association with data collected in the surveillance study during 1988-1992 from a new set of patients (355 cases of prostatic cancer and 2,048 controls with nonmalignant conditions). Because some studies have reported increased relative risks of lung cancer and testicular cancer in vasectomized men, we also used the surveillance database (4,126 men with various cancers, 7,027 men with nonmalignant conditions) to assess the relation of vasectomy to the risk of these and other cancers. In the newly collected data, the multivariate relative risk estimate for prostatic cancer in vasectomized men was 1.2 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.6-2.7). For lung cancer and testicular cancer, the relative risk estimates were 1.3 (95% CI 0.8-2.1) and 0.8 (95% CI 0.4-1.9), respectively; for lung cancer occurring > or = 15 years after vasectomy, the relative risk estimate was 1.9 but it was not statistically significant (95% CI 0.7-5.0). For pancreatic cancer, the relative risk estimate was 1.8 (95% CI 1.0-3.1). For each of the other cancers considered--malignant melanoma, large bowel cancer, bladder cancer, kidney cancer, lymphoma, leukemia, and other cancers--the relative risk estimate was 1.3 or less and compatible with a value of 1.0. The present data provide little support for an association of vasectomy with the risk of prostatic cancer or other cancers.

Growth factors were found to reduce the treatment related morbidity and improve the practicability of therapeutic regimens. First studies on a prospective chemotherapy dose intensification supported by growth factors are underway. As a further effect of growth factors an attempted enhancement of anti-tumor cytotoxicity by recruitment of tumor cells to chemosensitivity or by modulation of anti-tumor drug metabolism appears realistic as from first data of growth factor priming in acute myeloid leukemia. New ways to support high intensity and myelo-ablative anti-tumor strategies are opened by the autologous transplantation of peripheral blood progenitor cells mobilized by growth factors and also by the use of new factors like stem cell factor and the synergistic combination of growth factors as part of future strategies against malignant disorders.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have performed quantitative studies of CREB binding in the presence and absence of Tax in an attempt to gain insight into the mechanism of the Tax effect. Enhancement of binding occurred over a wide range of CREB concentrations, but sharply increased at the lowest concentrations tested. The data are best explained by a two-step binding model where Tax changes the apparent equilibrium constants for both a CREB-CREB dimerization step and a (CREB)2-DNA binding step. We used the model to perform a quantitative analysis of the binding of CREB to DNA that had been mutated at positions flanking the core CREB recognition site. Results suggest that there are altered or more extensive DNA-protein contacts at these positions in the presence of Tax. We also used the model to analyze differences in the interaction of Tax with nonphosphorylated and protein kinase A-phosphorylated CREB protein.

These differences were directly attributable to loss of an HLF ancillary DNA-binding domain in all E2A-HLF chimeras and were further exacerbated by a zipper mutation in one isolate. Both wild-type and chimeric HLF proteins displayed transcriptional activator properties in lymphoid and nonlymphoid cells on reporter genes containing HLF or C/EBP consensus binding sites. But on reporter genes with nonoptimal binding sites, their transcriptional properties diverged and E2A-HLF competitively inhibited activation by wild-type PAR proteins. These findings establish a spectrum of binding site-specific transcriptional properties for E2A-HLF which may preferentially activate expression of select subordinate genes as a homodimer and potentially antagonize expression of others through heteromeric interactions.",,PMC359124,,,,,,,,,,,,

After the induction treatment, we found a significant increase of HDL-C and Apo A1 values only in those patients that achieved a complete remission.

In this study we describe the effect on murine erythroleukemia cells, transfected with a temperature-sensitive mutant p53, of exposure to the differentiating agent dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO). Rather than terminally differentiating, these cells are induced to undergo apoptosis. Interestingly, exposure to DMSO leads to an alteration of the protein conformation of the p53 mutant to one recognized by a wild-type specific monoclonal antibody. This is accompanied by a translocation of the p53 protein from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. These results suggest that the activity of some mutant p53 proteins can be functionally modified by exogenous compounds.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

K562 cells activate the mRNA for HSP-70A, HSP-70B' and HSP-28 genes in the presence of hemin or sodium butyrate as cells differentiate into late erythroblasts. K562 cells become progressively more resistant to killing by heat shock during their differentiation to late erythroblasts. Further, selective inhibition of HSP-70A by antisense oligonucleotides to reduce HSP-70 kDa accumulation results in consistent reduction of hemoglobin production by 25-30% in K562 cells exposed to hemin, HL-60 cells differentiate into mature macrophages within 3 days following addition of PMA. HSP-70A mRNA levels increase within the first 2 h of PMA treatment and remain elevated for up to 3 days during the cells' gradual differentiation into mature macrophages. PMA and sodium butyrate treatment also cause elevated levels of HSP-28 mRNA expression; this increase is barely detectable at 24 h but is considerable at 72 h when about 90% of HL-60 cells are differentiated into mature macrophages or monocytes. These studies show that HSP-70A, HSP-70B' and HSP-28 may have specific roles during the differentiation of blood cell progenitors into erythrocytes or macrophages.

Recent evidence indicates that the basis for the limited duration of ATRA's activity, at least in one form of leukemia, is a pharmacological adaptation that results in reduced serum concentration after prolonged treatment. This finding suggests that an i.v. formulation of ATRA may significantly improve the potency and duration of ATRA's activity in leukemia and, potentially, other malignancies as well. Liposomal ATRA (L-ATRA) was developed to provide a formulation of this retinoic acid isomer that can be administered intravenously to provide potential pharmacological advantages over the oral formulation. When L-ATRA was administered to rats over a prolonged period, the blood levels of the drug did not change over time. In vitro studies of isolated liver microsomes revealed that catabolism of the drug was not altered in rats that were repeatedly administered the L-ATRA formulation. Whereas microsomes isolated from animals that were orally administered free ATRA the same number of times with the same doses showed a significant increase in metabolism of the drug.

The average splenic platelet pools, prior to and after 8 months of IFN, were 58 +/- 17 and 47 +/- 11%, respectively. At the time when treatment was initiated, the patients were heterogeneous as regards the spleen size, platelet kinetics, and the bone marrow morphology. Three patients had values for P below the 95th percentile for a group of healthy control subjects; following IFN therapy they displayed a substantial increase in P. In three other HCL patients, with the largest spleens, the pre-treatment P was normal, or slightly above the values seen for the control subjects. In these patients, changes in splenic platelet pool size, blood volume, and platelet mean life-span accounted for the increase in platelet count observed in response to IFN.

An excellent assessment of cellularity by aspirate and biopsy was found. The estimation of BM cellularity for each group was utilized with and without age adjustment based on normal marrow biopsies. Without correcting the BM cellularity for age it was observed that the median BM cellularity was > 50% in AML, CGL, PV and ET. In contrast, the median BM cellularity was estimated at 40% for MDS. In the age group 70 years and beyond the median BM cellularity was not changed in CGL, PV and ET, and only slightly decreased (35%) in MDS. However, a trend from hypercellularity to normocellularity was observed in patients with AML in this age group. By utilizing anatomic comparisons with normal age the corrected data disclosed that all patients with CGL, PV and ET, 63% of patients with AML and only 35% of patients with MDS had hypercellular BM according to their age, while only two patients with AML and seven patients with MDS were found to be truly hypocellular by age. The optimal cut-off value for definition of hypocellular AML and hypocellular MDS, and differences between MDS and other myeloid stem cell disorders in terms of BM cellularity have been discussed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Few studies include substantial numbers of elderly patients. PURPOSE: We evaluated women with cancer of the uterine corpus, the majority of whom were treated at older ages, to gain additional information on cancer risk following partial-body radiotherapy and to examine differences in risk between external-beam therapy and brachytherapy. METHODS: A cohort of 110,000 women with invasive cancer of the uterine corpus who survived at least 1 year following their initial cancer was assembled from nine population-based cancer registries. Cancer diagnoses occurred from 1935 through 1985, and most patients were diagnosed during the 1960s and 1970s. Radiation doses were computed to 17 sections of the active bone marrow for 218 women who developed leukemia and for 775 matched control subjects. RESULTS: Radiotherapy did not increase the risk of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) (relative risk [RR] = 0.90; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.4-1.9). However, for all leukemias except CLL, a significant risk was identified (RR = 1.92; 95% CI = 1.3-2.9). Overall, the pattern of risk in relation to dose was erratic and was most consistent with a constant increased risk across the entire dose range. The risk following continuous exposures from brachytherapy at comparatively low doses and low dose rates (RR = 1.80; 95% CI = 1.1-2.8; mean dose = 1.72 Gy) was similar to that after fractionated exposures at much higher doses and higher dose rates from external-beam treatment (RR = 2.29; 95% CI = 1.4-3.7; mean dose = 9.88 Gy), indicating a large difference in the estimated risk per unit dose. Risk did not vary by age at first exposure; increased risks were apparent for irradiated patients aged 65 years or older (RR = 1.77; 95% CI = 0.9-3.5). CONCLUSION: The leukemia risk associated with partial-body radiotherapy for uterine corpus cancer was small; about 14 excess leukemia cases were due to radiation per 10,000 women followed for 10 years. Women aged 65 years or older had a radiation risk comparable with that found in younger women. The relationship of leukemia risk to radiation dose was found to be complex due to the competing processes of cell killing, transformation, and repair. At very high doses delivered at high rates, destruction of cells likely dominates, and the risk per unit dose is low. In the low dose range, where dose was protracted and delivered at relatively low dose rates, the leukemia risk appears lower than that projected from risk estimates derived from the instantaneous whole-body exposures of atomic bomb survivors.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The process is best characterized in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans where ced genes mediate the death of specific cells during development. Some corresponding genes have been identified in mammalian cells. Expression of the mammalian bcl-2 gene (homologous to ced-9) suppresses apoptosis in many systems. The ced-3 gene is homologous to a mammalian protease. Increased levels of the tumor suppressor p53 due to DNA damage may result in either blockage of the cell cycle at G1 or apoptosis. Mutation of p53 is associated with decreased cell death from radiation and cytotoxic drugs. Initiation of the apoptotic pathway may occur as a consequence of conflicting growth signals. Hierarchical relationships variously between bcl-2, p53, myc, and other genes indicate a complex pattern of regulation. Stimuli resulting in apoptosis may cause production of free radicals and increased intracellular calcium concentration. The relationship of these changes to the hallmark of apoptosis, internucleosomal fragmentation of DNA, is unclear, and ""laddering"" of DNA is not always evident. Apoptotic DNA degradation probably occurs sequentially, initially involving breakage into 50 kilobases or larger fragments. The nuclease(s) responsible have not been identified, but deoxyribonuclease I is implicated. The association between nuclease activation and chromatin condensation is complex, and programmed cell death may be subject to cytoplasmic regulation.

Different combinations of DMPC, DMPG and cholesterol were used. The quality of the liposomal formulations was evaluated by calculating the percentage drug bound to the liposome phase and assessing the morphology of the liposome phase by optic microscopy, to rule out the presence of drug crystals or drug/lipid microaggregates. Good liposomal preparations were obtained with hexamethylmelamine, penclomedine, mitindomide, and fazarabine. However, with taxol, batracylin, trimelamol, and diaziquone, the presence of crystals of free drug or microaggregates of lipid/drug complex was observed in all preparations, independently of lipid composition. In general, mixtures of DMPC:DMPG at a molar ratio between 7:3 and 9:1, and the addition of 5 per cent cholesterol (w/w) gave the optimal results. In vitro cytotoxicity studies of free and liposomal drugs against L1210 cells showed changes in both directions after liposome entrapment, thus suggesting that liposome entrapment may alter drug cellular uptake or may result in chemical modifications of the entrapped drug.

In order to compare the TAPP-Br release profiles from GMs prepared with different procedures, in vitro studies were carried out. The biological effect of TAPP-Br released from gelatin microspheres was determined on 'in vitro' cultured tumour cell lines, showing that, after encapsulation, TAPP-Br still retains antiproliferative activity comparable with that exhibited by the free drug.

LIF stimulates an increase in the size of the muscle fibers rather than an increase in total number. Perfusion of 125I-labelled LIF (125I-LIF) at the site of the crush leads to uptake of the great majority of 125I-LIF into the muscle, which suggests that LIF is acting directly at the site of injury. Further, following crush injury LIF mRNA synthesis commences in the muscle. These data provide evidence that LIF is acting as a natural trauma factor in vivo and is actively involved in muscle regeneration.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Similarly, cross-linking of the activation marker CD69, which belongs to the natural killer complex, causes apoptosis of lipopolysaccharide-preactivated monocytes. Here we show that pertussis toxin (PTX) inhibits the activation-induced apoptosis of these three cell types, though it fails to prevent the programmed cell death that follows exposure of cells to the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone (thymocytes, pre-B cells) or to interleukin 4 (monocytes). The capacity of pertussis toxin to suppress activation-induced death is not due to quenching of the activation signal, because thymocytes exposed to PTX are still capable of mobilizing Ca2+ after TCR-alpha/beta cross-linking and proliferate in response to costimulation with PTX and CD3/TCR ligation. The apoptosis-inhibitory effect of PTX depends on the presence of an intact adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-ribosylating moiety, since a mutant pertussis toxin molecule that lacks enzymatic activity, but still possesses the membrane translocating activity, fails to interfere with activation-induced cell death. A toxin that induces a different spectrum of ADP ribosylation than PTX, cholera toxin, fails to inhibit apoptosis. To suppress apoptosis, the intact PTX holotoxin must be added to cells before the lethal activation step; its addition 30 min after initial activation remains without effect on apoptosis. These data unravel a PTX sensitive signal transduction event that intervenes during an early step of activation-induced cell death of immune cells.",,PMC2191663,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A series of bone marrow smears either Romanowsky stained, or frozen and unstained, and aged from one month to 20 years were hybridised with biotin labelled probes specific for the centromeric regions of human chromosomes X, 6, and 18. Sites of hybridisation were detected with fluoresceinated avidin. One hundred to 400 cells from each preparation were examined and the number of signals observed was recorded. RESULTS: All smears exhibited signals in most cells examined. In cytogenetically normal cases, an average 67.6% of cells (range 36%-90%) demonstrated the appropriate number of X centromere signals. In those samples known to contain extra chromosomes X, 6, or 18 the presence of cells with the abnormal copy number was clearly detected in each case.

At the nucleus, beta II PKC directly phosphorylates the nuclear envelope polypeptide lamin B at two consensus PKC phosphorylation sites, Ser395 and Ser405. Phosphorylation of these sites by beta II PKC leads to solubilization of lamin B indicative of mitotic nuclear envelope breakdown in vitro (Hocevar, B.A., Burns, D.J., and Fields, A.P. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 7545-7552). We have now investigated the molecular basis for beta II PKC-selective nuclear translocation and lamin B phosphorylation using an in vitro reconstitution system. We find that beta II PKC phosphorylates nuclear envelope lamin B at 10-20 times the rate of alpha PKC, whereas both kinases phosphorylate soluble lamin B at similar rates. Comparative tryptic phosphopeptide analysis demonstrates that alpha PKC and beta II PKC phosphorylate identical sites, Ser395 and Ser405, on soluble lamin B. These data suggest that a component(s) of the nuclear envelope confers beta II PKC-selective nuclear activation and lamin B phosphorylation. Extraction of nuclear envelopes with either non-ionic detergent (2% n-octyl glucoside) or organic solvent (CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O; 10:10:3) abolishes beta II PKC-selective phosphorylation of nuclear lamin B. Nuclear membrane extracts reconstitute beta II PKC-selective phosphorylation, indicating the presence of a beta II PKC-selective nuclear membrane activation factor (NMAF). NMAF selectively activates beta II PKC histone H1 kinase activity 3-4-fold above the level achieved with optimal concentrations of Ca2+, diacylglycerol, and phosphatidylserine.

In order to examine whether the growth-inhibitory effect of bufalin on human cancer cells is associated with apoptosis, human leukemia cells were treated with bufalin. HL-60, ML1, and U937 leukemia cells treated with bufalin at 10(-8) M and above had condensed and fragmented nuclei. Flow cytometric analysis of these cells treated with bufalin showed fragmented DNA smaller than that of the G1 phase. DNA of HL-60 cells treated with bufalin showed a ladder pattern characteristic of apoptosis, as analyzed by agarose gel electrophoretic analysis. DNA synthesis and topoisomerase II activity of HL-60 cells were markedly inhibited as the concentration of bufalin was increased. The concentration needed for inducing apoptosis of HL-60 cells was 10(-8) M, which is comparable to that of camptothecin, but lower than those of other antitumor drugs such as cisplatin, VP16 and all-trans retinoic acid. Apoptosis was not observed when human mononuclear and polymorphonuclear cells were treated with 10(-6) M bufalin for 24 h. These results indicate the association of the growth-inhibitory effect of bufalin with the induction of apoptosis, at least in HL-60 cells, and suggest the usefulness of bufalin for differentiation-apoptosis-inducing therapy for cancer.",,PMC5919529,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the translocations affect various chromosome sites including the immunoglobulin gene loci, molecular studies have indicated that the breakages are clustered within a 10-kb-long major translocation cluster region (MTC) at band 3q27. In the current study, we have used a genomic probe from the MTC to study 51 Japanese patients having B-cell neoplasms with regard to rearrangement of LAZ3. The study detected rearrangement in 12 cases out of 51; the rearrangements occurred within a limited region close to the first exon of the LAZ3 gene. Eight cases out of 12 with rearrangement had diffuse large cell NHL and the immunoblastic variant, including one case transformed from a follicular lymphoma carrying the BCL2 rearrangement. However, the rearrangement was also identified in two NHL patients showing a follicular growth pattern, in one case with indolent chronic lymphocytic leukemia and in one case with high-grade small noncleaved cell lymphoma with a bulky abdominal mass. Cytogenetic analysis revealed t(3;14)(q27;q32) in 2 cases, t(3;22)(q27;q11) in 3, and a newly identified translocation t(3;6)(q21) in one case. LAZ3 expression was demonstrated in cells carrying the LAZ3 rearrangement, suggesting transcriptional deregulation of the gene. Our results are compatible with previous cytogenetic reports in which the 3q27 translocation was observed in 15-20% of NHL; however, patients with the LAZ3 rearrangements exhibited a wide range of clinico-pathologic characteristics. Thus, there is no clear consistent association of the 3q27 translocation with a specific subtype of B-cell neoplasm.","['BCL', 'IG', 'IGH', 'LAZ3', 'MYC']",PMC5919522,,,,,,,,,,,,

Such oligomers may be designed to complement a region of a specific gene or messenger RNA. Using this approach, oligonucleotides can serve as a potential block of transcription or translation through sequence-specific hybridization with targeted genetic segments. In the Fourth Meeting of the Italian Society of Experimental Hematology ""Discutiamone Insieme"", authors reported the use of in vitro synthesized oligonucleotides to inhibit normal and chimeric gene expression of bcl-2 in normal and neoplastic cell lines, respectively, that carry the t(14;18) translocation. The roles of c-myb and B-myb in the control of the proliferation and differentiation of normal hematopoietic cell lines have been investigated by selective inhibition of the expression of specific transcripts. To get some insight into the correlation between proliferation and differentiation in myeloid cells, some authors studied and reported the differentiation potential of G1-arrested cells obtained by a specific oligodeoxynucleotide complementary to the 5' region of the c-myb mRNA. The use of anti-P53 antisense oligos in the modulation of the growth of normal and neoplastic bone marrow progenitors was presented and confirmed the pivotal role of this gene in cell cycle control. The role of abl gene expression in normal and chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) cells is not yet completely understood. Selective inhibition of this proto-oncogene and of the abl-bcr oncogene have been achieved by using of c-abl sequence specific antisense oligonucleotides; this approach sheds new light on the function of this gene in CML.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Forty-eight ALL adults (30 men and 18 women) in first complete remission (CR) were investigated. RESULTS: Severe reproductive function impairment was detected in 10/12 males receiving treatment, while endocrine function was affected in only 1 case. All but one off-therapy male showed normal reproductive function; moreover, endocrine function was impaired in only one male. Eight of 10 females receiving treatment showed hypergonadotropinemia and decreased estrogen levels. All off-therapy women reported regular menses, even though mild hypergonadotropinemia persisted in only 2 cases. Adrenal androgen function was depressed in 12/22 on-therapy patients in both sexes, and in 6/17 off-therapy males. All off-therapy females recovered completely. Dihydroepiandrosterone-sulfate (DHEA-S) serum levels were significantly correlated to the length of time-off therapy (p = 0.003), and inversely correlated to the age at diagnosis (p < 0.0001) in off-therapy males.

Apoptosis was detected by electrophoresis gel of DNA oligonucleosomal fragments in 8 CML samples. RESULTS: Only FLU and FLU plus alpha-IFN significantly activated apoptosis in all the samples, suggesting selective activity on CML cells. On the other hand, alpha-IFN alone did not activate programmed cell death. CONCLUSIONS: Our data show apoptotic activity for FLU on CML cells. Programmed cell death may be suppressed in cells carrying the bcr-abl transcript, and FLU might remove this resistance in the neoplastic cell cycle. This preliminary report justifies using FLU in pilot clinical trials for chronic phase Ph1+ CML patients.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Due to the nature of the affected cells, Gaucher's disease is an excellent candidate for gene therapy of hematopoietic stem cells and autologous bone marrow transplantation of transduced cells using retroviral vectors containing the glucocerebrosidase (GC) gene. In order to identify a retroviral vector capable of high levels of expression of the GC gene in macrophages, we have used the murine myeloid leukemia cell line, M1, a cell line that can be differentiated with interleukin-6 (IL-6) from blasts to macrophages. Two vectors use the Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMLV) enhancer/promoter (LG vector) or the myeloproliferative sarcoma virus (MPSV) enhancer/MoMLV promoter (MG vector), both located in the viral long-terminal repeat (LTR); the third vector uses the phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) promoter located internally in the vector (PG vector). The amphotropic PA317 and GP+am12 packaging cell lines were used as virus producer cells, and the GP+am12 cell line demonstrated higher titers, higher levels of GC protein expression, and specific GC enzymatic activity as well as higher transduction efficiencies for all three vectors. The LG retroviral vector was the most efficient in transducing the M1 cells. On average, higher levels of RNA and protein expression were seen in the M1 clones transduced with the LG vector, and these levels increased after differentiation. Thus, the LG retroviral vector in which the expression of the GC gene is driven by the MoMLV LTR enhancer/promoter is the best vector of the three studied for future studies for gene therapy of Gaucher's disease and other hematopoietic disorders that involve macrophages.",['GC'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Within each series, which contained 4 homologues with differing alicyclic (cycloalkyl) ring size (cyclopropane, cyclobutane, cyclopentane, or cyclohexane), cytotoxicity increased with increasing ring size. This appeared to be due to an increase in partition coefficient, and the resulting increase in drug accumulation and intracellular DNA adducts in ascending each of the series. There were exceptions to this generalization, predominantly in L1210/DACH cells, where the biochemical pharmacology was not entirely consistent with the cytotoxic response and suggested that other factors may be at play. The relationship between structure and ability to circumvent cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II) and/or trans-1R,2R-1S,2S- diaminocyclohexanetetrachloroplatinum(IV) resistance was complex. Ascending the platinum(II) series caused resistance factors to decrease in L1210/DDP cells but increase in L1210/DACH cells. An increase in resistance factors was also observed in ascending the axial chloroplatinum(IV) series in the L1210/DACH line. In contrast, ascending the axial chloroplatinum(IV) series in the L1210/DDP line and axial acetatoplatinum(IV) and axial hydroxoplatinum(IV) series in both cell lines resulted in increases in resistance factors for the first stepwise increase in the cycloalkylamine ring size, but resistance factors then decreased progressively with further increases in ring size. Reduction of the platinum(IV) analogues to the platinum(II) congener appears to be necessary for binding to DNA. The similarity in biological actions between the platinum(II) and axial chloroplatinum(IV) series is likely due to the rapid reduction of tetravalent members to platinum(II) forms. The axial acetatoplatinum(IV) and axial hydroxoplatinum(IV) complexes were reduced more slowly, which may explain their lower potency, but not the ability of the higher member to circumvent both cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II) and trans-1R,2R-1S,2S- diaminocyclohexanetetrachloroplatinum(IV) resistances. Explanation for this will require additional studies. The results have demonstrated high dependencies on ring size of the carrier amine ligand, valence state of platinum, and the nature of the axial ligand for modulation of potency, cross-resistance property, and biochemical pharmacology of ammine/cycloalkylamine complexes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All normal peripheral blood cells, regardless of cell lineage (CD4, CD8, CD14, CD15, CD19, CD56), expressed a similar basal level of MRP mRNA. Specimens from bone marrow containing mixed lineages also expressed a similar basal level of MRP expression. In patients with acute myelocytic leukemia, 10 of 12 (83%) of the specimens had detectable MRP mRNA, but the level of expression was similar to that of normal blood cells and low compared to a cell line known to overexpress MRP (H69/AR). All myeloma patients (12 of 12) had detectable MRP mRNA expression at levels comparable to normal peripheral blood and bone marrow cells. We conclude that MRP is commonly expressed in normal hematopoietic cells as well as certain hematopoietic malignancies. The therapeutic relevance of MRP expression is unknown, but these studies emphasize the importance of measuring MRP expression in normal cells as a point of reference and comparison for detection in malignant cells. We also recommend obtaining sequential specimens from patients, which may reveal an increased expression of MRP from baseline as the disease progresses and becomes resistant.",['MRP'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, it was observed that a protein-free emulsion resembling the lipid portion of LDL (LDE) behave like native LDL when injected into the bloodstream. In this study, the evidence that LDE is taken up by rLDL was expanded by comparing LDL and LDE plasma decay curves in rabbits and by competition experiments with lymphocytes. To verify whether LDE could be removed from the plasma by neoplastic cells with increased rLDL, LDE labeled with 14Ccholesteryl ester was injected into 14 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and into 7 with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL). In AML rLDL expression is increased but in ALL it is normal. LDE plasma fractional clearance rate (FCR, in h-1) was calculated from the remaining radioactivity measured in plasma samples collected during 24 h following injection. LDE FCR was 3-fold greater in AML than in ALL patients 0.192 +/- 0.210 (SD) and 0.066 +/- 0.033 h-1, respectively, P < 0.035. When LDE injection was repeated in 9 AML patients in hematological remission, LDE FCR diminished 66% compared to the pretreatment values (from 0.192 +/- 0.210 to 0.065 +/- 0.038 h-1, P < 0.02), so that it could be estimated that nearly 66% of the emulsion was taken up by AML cells and only 34% by the normal tissues. As expected, LDE FCR was unchanged in 4 patients with ALL in hematological remission (0.069 +/- 0.044 h-1). Gamma camera images obtained 6 h after the injection of 99mTc-label LDE into one patient with ALL showed biodistribution similar to that of LDL. In one AML patient LDE was comparatively more concentrated over the areas corresponding to the bone marrow infiltrated by AML cells. Our results indicate that LDE FCR is increased in a disease known to contain malignant cells that overexpress rLDL, suggesting that LDE is taken up by malignant cells with increased rLDL.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the use of radioisotopes in the clinical setting is often problematic. Because of this we investigated the use of a digoxigenin-labeled probe and chemiluminography in the detection of the Philadelphia translocation. In this study DNA was extracted from 19 bone marrow or blood samples from patients with CML or other malignancies and subjected to Southern blotting with a probe specific for the Philadelphia translocation, Phl/bcr3. The probe was labeled with either 32P or digoxigenin to determine the relative sensitivity and specificity of autoradiography and chemiluminography in the molecular diagnosis of the BCR/abl fusion gene. All 19 samples were tested by both methods. All blots were performed and interpreted by individuals blind to the initial patient diagnosis. In addition, 12 samples (6 positive for CML, 6 negative for CML as determined by Southern blotting with 32P-labeled probe) were subjected to triplicate Southern-blot analyses, with three separate lots of digoxigenin-labeled probe to assay batch to batch variability in the efficacy of the probe. Radiolabeled and digoxigenin-labeled probes resulted in identical diagnoses in all cases. All results obtained by molecular analysis correlated perfectly with the clinical diagnoses of the patients from whom the samples had been obtained. Reanalysis of patient samples with different batches of digoxigenin-labeled probe gave highly reproducible results. With digoxigenin-labeled probe, diagnostic results were obtained after exposure times of less than 1 h at room temperature.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",['Ph1'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Monotherapy with either methotrexate (MTX) (n = 59) or cyclosporin (CSA) (n = 40) was given to 79 patients less than 30 years of age and to 20 older patients. These patients were compared to those receiving a combination of MTX+CSA (n = 55) or T-cell depletion (TCD) (n = 28) (38 patients < or = 30 and 45 > 30 years of age). Patient characteristics were similar in the two pairs of groups. The median follow-up time was between 4.7 and 9.6 years in the different groups. In younger patients, the incidence of grade II-IV acute GvHD was 38% amongst those treated with MTX or CSA and 14% in the MTX+CSA/TCD group (p = 0.008). Forty percent of older patients on monotherapy developed grade II-IV acute GvHD compared to 26% of those over 30 treated with MTX+CSA/TCD (ns). As a consequence, mortality from GvHD among younger patients was 19% in the monotherapy group and 3% in the MTX+CSA/TCD group (p = 0.03) with 37% and 10% (p = 0.04) in the older patient groups. The cumulative incidence of chronic GvHD was similar amongst treatments in the younger patients (39% in monotherapy and 39% in MTX+CSA/TCD), but was significantly lower in the MTX+CSA/TCD group among patients > 30 (55% vs 25%, p = 0.05). The actuarial overall survival at 5 years was unchanged in patients < or = 30, 49% and 43% in the monotherapy and MTX+CSA/TCD groups, respectively. However, in older patients survival increased from 25% to 46% (p = 0.04). An increase in leukemic relapse associated with MTX+CSA/TCD among both younger (26% vs 48%, p = 0.05) and older patients (0% vs 46%, p = 0.05) influenced the relapse-free survival, 48% vs 39% (ns) in younger and 25% vs 37% (ns) in older patients. Risk-factors for survival were dependent on the type of GvHD prophylaxis used. Using monotherapy, in contrast to combination therapy or TCD, multivariate analysis showed that recipient age > 30 years and HLA disparity between donor and recipient were correlated with poor outcome. In patients receiving MTX + CSA or TCD, a female donor to a male recipient correlated significantly with poor survival, which was not the case with monotherapy. Disease status beyond 1st complete remission (1 CR) or 1st chronic phase (1 CP), grade II-IV acute GvHD and recipient CMV seropositivity were significant risk-factors among all patients regardless of the type of GvHD prophylaxis.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This virus and the protein tyrosine kinase encoded by abl are well known for their ability to transform B lymphocyte progenitors. Most of the transformed cells resemble a normal B lineage progenitor called a pre-B cell and appear to be arrested in differentiation at the stage of immunoglobulin light chain gene rearrangement. Recent evidence obtained using temperature-sensitive Abelson virus mutants provides direct support for this idea. Lymphoid cells transformed by one such virus undergo light chain rearrangement soon after shift to the nonpermissive temperature. This event is accompanied by several changes classically associated with light chain gene rearrangement including increased activity of the NF-kappa B transcription factor, expression of light chain RNAs and increased levels of expression of the RAG-1 and RAG-2 genes. Although the mechanism by which abl protein blocks the activity of these factors is not yet known, these data suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation may be intimately connected to regulation of early B cell development and expression of genes that are central to all phases of antigen receptor gene rearrangement.","['abl', 'v-abl']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The sustained self-renewal observed in the context of their retrovirus-mediated leukemic transformation has been viewed as an abnormal, oncogene-induced effect. Recently, however, it was found that certain combinations of growth/differentiation hormones (e.g. TGF-alpha and estradiol) can induce normal avian erythroid progenitors to undergo a similarly extensive self-renewal as caused by oncogenes. This leads to the hypothesis that leukemia-inducing oncogenes take advantage of the committed erythroid progenitors' capacity for self-renewal rather than reprogramming their targets to abnormal growth, as suspected previously. These findings and their implications will be discussed.","['v-erbA', 'v-erbB']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The study of cellular drug resistance has been stimulated by the development of short-term 'total cell kill' assays, such as the MTT assay, for use on patient samples. The drug resistance profiles differed markedly between ALL and ANLL, between immunophenotypic and karyotypic subgroups within ALL, and between initial and relapsed ALL. The results of the MTT assay showed a significant relation between the antileukemic activity of prednisolone in vitro and the clinical response to systemic monotherapy with that drug. At multivariate analysis including several well-known prognostic factors (WBC, age, immunophenotype) only the in vitro resistance to prednisolone, dexamethasone, L-asparaginase, and daunorubicin was significantly related to clinical outcome. At multiple regression analysis, combination of the results for prednisolone, L-asparaginase, and vincristine made it possible to distinguish between three patient groups with increasing levels of drug resistance and markedly different probabilities of 2-year disease-free survival: 100%, 83%, and 60%. These results show that in vitro drug resistance testing can give a correct prediction of prognosis, superior to that of currently used prognostic factors. Stratification of prognostic groups based on the results of drug resistance testing is feasible and should be introduced into new clinical trials. Many questions now remaining could be answered within carefully designed preclinical and clinical studies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The capacity for IL-6 secretion was evaluated in 58 patients with various B-cell leukemias/lymphomas and in four patients with Castleman's disease (CMD). Cell populations from various sites including peripheral blood, bone marrow, lymph nodes, and osteolytic bone lesions were cultured and tested for spontaneous or IL-1 beta/TNF alpha-induced IL-6 production in a sensitive bioassay. No significant IL-6 levels were released by the tumor cells in any of the B-cell leukemias or lymphomas tested, including hairy cell leukemia (HCL) and B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL). In contrast, purified malignant plasma cells were found to secrete IL-6, strengthening the idea that an autocrine pathway for growth regulation in multiple myeloma (MM) exists. For the first time, in several patients with CMD, peripheral blood cells were shown to produce extremely high levels of IL-6, the pathogenetic significance of which remains to be elucidated. However, similar observations were very occasionally made in MM patients. Therapy with corticosteroids strongly inhibited this IL-6 production. These data provide evidence for autocrine and possibly an additional paracrine regulatory loop in plasma cell neoplasias and CMD.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The overall response rate to first-line empirical antibiotic combination was seen in 61.92%, the best results being with ceftazidime and amikacin combination (65.69%). A uniform antibiotic policy resulted in a decrease in mortality, with the number of deaths decreasing significantly in the 1989 to 1991 era (P = 0.00000003). The other contributing factors were an improvement in the supportive care with a reduction in length of hospital stay during induction. Our fungal isolates demonstrated 11 patients with documented fungal infection with a positive outcome in 8 patients.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A series of monomethyl derivatives of N-(2-dimethylaminoethyl)-acridine-4-carboxamide that have anti-tumour activity are good inhibitors of MLCK (IC50 values ranging from 4-138 microM) but these same compounds are ineffective or relatively poor inhibitors of PKC or cAK.

The four exceptions found to this generality are effective inhibitors of all three protein kinases with IC50 values of about 100 microM or less. With several exceptions azaacridine inhibitors of PKC are also inhibitors of MLCK but effective inhibitors of cAK are relatively poor inhibitors of MLCK and PKC and vice versa. 4-N-(2-dimethylaminoethyl)-6-azaacridone-4-carboxamide is a competitive inhibitor of MLCK with respect to both the peptide substrate and ATP. All other acridines and azaacridines examined are non-competitive inhibitors of both MLCK and cAK with respect to both ATP and peptide substrate. All azaacridine PKC inhibitors examined are competitive with respect to ATP and noncompetitive with respect to peptide substrate suggesting that binding of these inhibitors is at or near the enzyme active site. The inhibition of MLCK (but not cAK or PKC) by anti-tumour acridine carboxamides suggests a novel site of in vivo biological action and a useful criterion for the detection of potential antitumour compounds.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Deletions were constructed in the R/U5 region to localize the sequences responsible for this effect. The activity of the different constructs was determined in a transient expression system. Our results show that a 64 bp long sequence (called DAS), present at the 3 end of the R region, is involved in the activation. The in vivo results indicate that DAS could be divided into two independent but overlapping elements (DAS1,2). Sequence comparison allows the identification of three conservative boxes in these elements. Our results suggest, that these boxes are functional only together. The gel-shift assay with DAS2, in good agreement with the in vivo data, demonstrates that only the full length element forms a low mobility DNA-protein complex.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This report describes an infantile case revealing an acute myeloid leukemia. CASE REPORT: A 14 month-old girl was admitted because of enlarged bilateral cervical lymph nodes. They had increased in volume over the past month and were accompanied by fever and anorexia. The liver and spleen were moderately enlarged. Hematologic data were: Hb = 7.5 g%; leucocytes = 14,900/mm3; platelets = 614,000/mm3. There were no abnormal cells. X-rays and MRI showed a mediastinal mass. Bone scintigraphy was normal but the myelogram showed a few atypical cells that were also seen in a biopsy of the cervical lymph node. Electron microscopic examination of these cells showed that they were myeloid in origin. This was confirmed by immunohistochemistry. The cytogenetic examination showed many chromosomal abnormalities in the lymph node and myelogram. The child is now recovered after nine months of chemotherapy.

IL-11, leukemia inhibitory factor, oncostatin M, and ciliary neurotrophic factor have similar effects with IL-6. This functional redundancy was well explained by the common signal transducer gp 130. Furthermore, recent studies have revealed the mechanisms to regulate the gene expression of IL-6 and to transduce the signal through IL-6 receptor system.

We report the use of a novel combination of techniques to simultaneously identify and quantify the products generated from a whole cell extract in a single experiment. Several radiolabeled glycosphingolipid products were generated by the addition of UDP-[14C]Gal to a reaction mixture containing an homogenate from a human leukemia cell line, THP-1. After the 14C-labeled products were separated on a TLC plate, storage phosphor technology and immunostaining (with carbohydrate sequence-specific monoclonal antibodies) were used sequentially on the same plate to simultaneously identify and quantify each of the glycosyltransferase products. This method allows product identification and quantification in the femtomole range. Thus, low levels of endogenous acceptors were easily detected. We have used a similar method with UDP-[3H]Gal to obtain glycosyltransferase product profiles from several human leukemia/lymphoma cell lines and subsequently identify two galactosyltransferase activities in these cell lines: UDP-Gal:Gal beta 1-4Glc beta 1-1Cer alpha 1,4galactosyltransferase; and UDP-Gal:GlcNAc beta 1--3Gal beta 1--4Glc beta 1--1Cer beta 1,4galactosyltransferase.

DESIGN: Review of the English-language literature concerning studies on adult ALL and comparisons with the pediatric ALL results when appropriate. RESULTS: Induction chemotherapy with a triple-drug regimen, including vincristine, anthracyclines, and steroids, yields the most favorable therapeutic-to-toxic ratio results. The addition of cyclophosphamide, asparaginase, or cytosine arabinoside (ara-C) to remission induction has not improved outcome. Consolidation-intensification therapy is beneficial in pediatric ALL and has been associated with increased cure rates in adult ALL, although the value of the individual components of therapy is difficult to assess. Based on the pediatric experience, future investigations in adult ALL should utilize higher dose-schedules of 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP), methotrexate, and asparaginase for consolidation-intensification therapy. The role of high-dose ara-C consolidation is not proven. Maintenance therapy with 6-MP and methotrexate is suggested based on the worse results in patients not receiving such maintenance. Allogeneic BMT is indicated in first remission in patients with high-risk for relapse (eg, Philadelphia-chromosome-positive [Ph-positive] ALL), while autologous BMT in first remission remains investigational. Mature B-cell ALL requires short-term/dose-intensive therapy with alternating hyperfractionated doses of cyclophosphamide and high doses of ara-C and methotrexate. T-cell ALL may benefit from ara-C plus cyclophosphamide consolidations. Based on certain risk features (ie, older age, high presenting white blood cell count, non-T-cell immunophenotype, Ph-positive karyotype, longer time to achieve remission), a high-risk group for systemic relapse (60% to 70% of patients) is identified with an expected cure rate of 20% to 25%; low-risk patients have an expected cure rate of 60% to 70%. Intrathecal chemotherapy may be sufficient as CNS prophylaxis, and its duration based on the expected risk of CNS relapse. CONCLUSION: Improvement in adult ALL prognosis has been modest. Future strategies may investigate increasing the dose-intensity of induction and consolidation-intensification therapy, incorporating new anti-ALL agents into the regimens, improving autologous BMT results (eg, purging, conditioning regimens), and appropriately using risk-oriented investigational strategies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A 60-year old woman complaining of easy bruises was found to have a 2-cm splenomegaly. Her laboratory data included the following: haemoglobin, 125 g/L; haematocrit, 0.35 L/L; white cell count, 29 x 10(9)/L with 32% PMN, 3% stabs, 2% myelocytes, 1% metamyelocytes, 30% lymphocytes and 32% atypical mononucleated cells showing wide, pale cytoplasm neatly contoured and oval nucleus with monocytoid features. The basal coagulation study showed prothrombin 50%, APTT 40 seconds, fibrinogen 68 mg/dL and FDP between 80 and 160 ng/dL. Splenomegaly without lymph-node enlargement was found on CT scan. The bone-marrow biopsy showed a 68% monocytoid lymphocytic infiltration, acid-phosphatase positive and tartrate-sensitive, without fibrosis. Bone-marrow and peripheral immunophenotype showed those cells to be CD22, CD 19 and CD11 positive, while T and CD25 markers were absent. The patient was treated with alpha-2b interferon at a dose of 3MU three times a week for 6 months, with general improvement and regression of the leukaemic expression. Eleven months after diagnosis she died of a central nervous system haemorrhage. The morphological, immunological and cytochemical features of the monocytoid lymphocytes in this case are commented, along with their variable behaviour. A review of the literature is also carried out, attention being laid on the onset and the response to therapy of B-cell monocytoid lymphomas as the singularity of this case lies on its exclusively leukaemic onset. It is concluded that an interrelationship between monocytoid B-lymphocytic leukaemia and B-cell monocytoid lymphoma might possibly exist, such as that between chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and diffuse lymphocytic lymphoma.",,,,,,,Leucemia de linfocitos monocitoides B.,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The number of patients under study was 226: 59 with refractory anaemia (RA), 49 with sideroblastic anaemia (RSA), 56 with refractory anaemia with excess of blast cells (RAEB), 48 with RAEB in transformation (RAEBT), and 14 with chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML). The period of the study was from January 1975 to December 1992. The mean age of the series was 67.4 years (ranging between 28 and 92) and the male/female ratio was 1.8. Transfusion frequency (TF) was defined as the time elapsed between two consecutive transfusions of two units of packed red cells. A platelet transfusion (PT) was comprised of 6 units of platelets or 1 unit obtained by thrombopheresis. The statistical analysis was performed with the chi 2 and Student's tests. RESULTS: Anaemia was present in 96.9% of the patients, regardless of the cytologic classification. Haemorrhages appeared in 41.6% of the cases with maximal frequency in CMML (78.6%) and minimal in RSA (10.2%). TF: Transfusion was required by 90.2% of the patients (86% of the RA, 79.6% of the RSA, 48.4% of RAEB, 97.9% of the RAEB-T, and 100% of the CMML). The mean TF was 1.5 months (1.9 for RA, 1.7 for RSA, 1.3 for RAEB, 0.9 for RAEB-T, 2.2. for CMML). PT: Platelet support was needed by 38.1% of the patients (30.5% of RA, 8.1% of RSA, 48.2% of RAEB, 58.3% of RAEB-T and 64.3% of CMML). The mean number of PT per patient was 7.2 (5.2 for RA, 3.8 for RSA, 9.7 for RAEB, 10.2 for RAEB-T, 7.1 for CMML). STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: The differences appreciated in TF were significant for the good prognostic groups (RA + RSA) as compared with the poor-risk ones (AREB + AREB-T + CMML) (p < 0.01), although significance is lost when these groups were taken one by one. For PT, significant differences appeared when comparing RA + RSA with RAEB + RAEB-T + CMML (p < 0.001); when the groups were compared one by one, significant differences were found only for RA versus RSA (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: 1) Red cell support was required by 90.2% of the patients with MDS, while platelet support was needed in 38.1% of the cases. 2) The cytologic poor-risk groups (RAEB, RAEB-T and CMML) required greater transfusion support as a whole than did the good prognostic ones (RA + RSA). 3) However, only RA showed significant differences with respect to RSA regarding PT, the remaining groups showing no such differences. 4) An irregular pattern was seen in RA and CMML with respect to PT in the former and to both TF and PT in the latter.",,,,,,,Analisis retrospectivo del soporte hemoterapico en 226 casos de sindromes mielodisplasicos.,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study was performed on 9 MDS patients distributed as follows: 4 with refractory anaemia, 2 with refractory anaemia with ringed sideroblasts, 2 with chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia and 1 with refractory anaemia with excess blasts in transformation. All the patients had been diagnosed at least three months earlier and had a mean monthly transfusion requirement of 3.5 blood units (range, 2-5.3). Baseline serum EPO levels were assessed by ELISA, subcutaneous r-huEPO was given at a doses of 10,000 IU three times a week. A positive response was defined as increase of haemoglobin rates in 1 g/dL or decrease of transfusion requirements in 50%. A negative response was registered when the haemoglobin rates or transfusion requirements were maintained in the patient. The results were evaluated 4,6 and 12 weeks after the beginning of the treatment. RESULTS: Response to treatment was seen in five patients (56%), who showed increased haemoglobin rates and in four of them (45%) no transfusions were needed since the onset of this therapy. The positive response to r-huEPO appeared within the 4th week of treatment. The four unresponsive patients (44%) showed no changes in spite of prolonged treatment. Positive responses correlated with increased red-cell progenitors in the bone marrow and decreased myelo/erythroid ratio. No severe untoward effects were seen with this treatment, and mild local pain at the sites of injection was alleviated by warming the r-huEPO solution before administration. CONCLUSIONS: MDS with symptomatic anaemia can be initially treated with r-huEPO for 4 weeks, although it seems advisable to maintain this treatment in respondents until the maximal response has been attained. On the contrary, when no response is seen in that period treatment must be discontinued.",,,,['Sangre (Barc). 1994 Aug;39(4):298-9. PMID: 7985061'],,,,,,,,,,

In the study reported here, rats were injected either intracerebrally or subcutaneously with 9L glioma cells expressing a chimeric hygromycin phosphotransferase-thymidine kinase fusion protein or with unmodified 9L cells. Tumor formation was decreased in the rats receiving modified cells, even in the absence of treatment with ganciclovir. Suppression of tumor growth was also observed with cells modified to express the intracellular selectable marker neomycin phosphotransferase. These results indicate that an intracellular selectable marker, in the absence of pharmacologic selection, can inhibit tumor growth of 9L cells.

These aberrations fuse the ALL-1 gene located at 11q23 to a series of partner genes positioned on a variety of human chromosomes. The fused genes encode chimeric proteins. Here we report the cloning and characterization of the ALL-1 partner at 17q21, the AF17 gene. The AF17 gene encodes a protein of 1093 amino acids, containing a leucine-zipper dimerization motif located 3' of the fusion point and a cysteine-rich domain at the N terminus. The latter can be arranged in three zinc fingers and shows homology to a domain within the protein Br140 (peregrin). AF17 contains stretches of amino acids previously associated with domains involved in transcriptional repression or activation. Based on features of AF17 and of the proteins encoded by the other partner genes analyzed and in conjunction with other recent studies, we propose a model in which ALL-1 rearrangements result in loss of function of the gene. In this model, the partner polypeptide plays an accessory role either by repressing activity of the truncated ALL-1 protein or by blocking the function of the normal protein presumably present in the leukemic cells.","['AF17', 'AF1P', 'AF4', 'AF6', 'AF9', 'ALL-1', 'ENL', 'MLL']",PMC44554,,,,['GENBANK/U07932'],,,,,,,,

Within 2 hr of AS-ACHE addition to the culture, ACHE mRNA levels dropped by approximately 90%, as compared with those in cells treated with the ""sense"" oligomer, S-ACHE. Four days after AS-ACHE treatment, ACHE mRNA increased to levels 10-fold higher than in S-ACHE cultures or in fresh bone marrow. At this later time point, differential PCR display revealed significant differences between cellular mRNA transcripts in bone marrow and those in AS-ACHE- or S-ACHE-treated cultures. These oligonucleotide-triggered effects underlay considerable alterations at the cellular level: AS-ACHE but not S-ACHE increased cell counts, reflecting enhanced proliferation. In the presence of erythropoietin it also enhanced colony counts, reflecting expansion of progenitors. AS-ACHE further suppressed apoptosis-related fragmentation of cellular DNA in the progeny cells, and it diverted hematopoiesis toward production of primitive blasts and macrophages in a dose-dependent manner promoted by erythropoietin. These findings suggest that the hematopoietic role of acetylcholinesterase, anticipated to be inverse to the observed antisense effects, is to reduce proliferation of the multipotent stem cells committed to erythropoiesis and megakaryocytopoiesis and macrophage production and to promote apoptosis in their progeny.

The result with TAL1 provides evidence that transcriptional activation can be mediated by a gene activated by translocation in T-cell acute leukemias. In the case of the liposarcoma, transactivation by the FUS-CHOP protein occurs because the FUS transcriptional activation domain is added to the DNA-binding CHOP protein normally lacking such activity. Therefore, the association of transcriptional activation and DNA-binding elements is a common consequence in proteins activated or newly created as fusion proteins after chromosomal translocations in acute leukemias and in malignant solid tumors.",,PMC44505,,,,,,,,,,,,

In human and murine hematopoiesis tal-1 is expressed during the differentiation of the erythroid, megakaryocytic and mastocytic cell lineages. The expression of tal-1 appears to be comodulated with that of the transcription factor GATA-1 gene, suggesting that the GATA-1 protein may regulate the tal-1 gene activity in these hematopoietic lineages. To get further insights into the molecular mechanisms that control tal-1 expression, we have isolated 5' sequences of the murine gene and compared them to their human counterparts. The 5' flanking sequences from the two genes show several regions of high homology. The alignment of both sequences enabled us to predict that similarly, to the human, the mouse gene contains two alternative first exons (Ia and Ib). Remarkably, in both species, the proximal region of the tissue-specific exon Ia (i.e. gene segment -122 to +1) contains two GATA-motifs (at -65 and -33) and one SP-1 consensus binding site (-59). Mobility shift assays demonstrate that GATA proteins are able to interact with both GATA-motifs in a sequence specific fashion, but with different efficiencies. Moreover transfection studies show that the GATA-1 protein directly mediates tal-1 transcription by interacting with the -122/+1 fragment, defined as a minimal promoter in erythroid cells. Mutagenesis of the promoter establishes that the -33 GATA-binding site present in this fragment is critical for tal-1 expression in erythroid cells, but by itself does not lead to full promoter activity. Indeed, further mutations show that the second -65 GATA-binding site and the binding motif for SP1 (-59) significantly contribute to the overall activity of the proximal tal-1 promoter. Altogether, our data provide evidence that GATA-1 cooperates with the transcription factor SP1 to mediate the erythroid-specific expression of the tal-1 gene.",['tal-1'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Similar down-regulation of nm23-H1 mRNA was also observed in the induced differentiation of the promyelocytic leukemia line HL-60 by TPA, or DMSO into monocyte-macrophage lineage or granulocytes, respectively. The amount of Nm23-H1 protein was analysed by Western immuno-blot analysis using mouse antiserum raised against a recombinant fusion protein with glutathione S-transferase. The amount of Nm23-H1 protein also decreased during the induced differentiation of these leukemia cell lines. On the other hand, in the differentiation of the erythroleukemia line K562 by hemin, levels of both mRNA and protein of Nm23-H1 elevated transiently, then reduced to the original level. When MEG-01 and K562 were stably transfected with nm23-H1 cDNA, MEG-01 transfectants showed reduced sensitivity to the induction of differentiation, whereas K562 transfectants were better induced to synthesize hemoglobin than controls. These findings suggest the possibility that Nm23-H1 protein plays an important role to maintain the proliferation of immature leukemic cells in MEG-01 and HL-60, but it may also play a role in the early stage of K562 differentiation, possibly in the different manner.","['nm23', 'nm23-H1']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent studies have demonstrated that ara-C treatment is associated with transient induction of the c-jun early response gene. The present studies have examined the effects of ara-C on c-jun expression in a phorbol ester-resistant variant of the HL-60 myeloid leukemia cell line, designated HL-525, that is deficient in protein kinase C (PKC)-mediated signal transduction and fails to respond to 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate with induction of c-jun transcripts. The results demonstrate that treatment of HL-525 cells with ara-C is associated with transcriptional activation of the c-jun gene. We also demonstrate that ara-C treatment is associated with activation of a PKC-like activity. Partial purification of this Ca(2+)-independent activity has demonstrated phosphorylation of synthetic peptides derived from (a) amino acids 4-14 of myelin basic protein and (b) the pseudosubstrate region of PKC (amino acids 19-31), with substitution of Ala25 with serine. The finding that the ara-C-induced activity is inhibited by the pseudosubstrate PKC(19-36) supports the activation of a PKC-like enzyme. Because PKC can act upstream of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases, we studied the effects of ara-C treatment on MAP kinase activity. The results demonstrate that MAP kinase is activated in ara-C-treated cells and that the kinetics of this activation are similar to those of the PKC-like activity. Because 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate has little, if any, effect on the PKC-like and MAP kinase activities in HL-525 cells, these findings suggest that ara-C activates a distinct signaling cascade that may contribute to induction of the c-jun gene.",['c-jun'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previously, we have demonstrated that the 30-fold VP-16-resistant K/VP.5 cell line exhibits decreased stability of drug-induced topoisomerase II/DNA covalent complexes, requires greater ATP concentrations to stimulate VP-16-induced topoisomerase II/DNA complex formation, and contains reduced mRNA and protein levels of the M(r) 170,000 isoform of topoisomerase II, compared with parental K562 cells. K/VP.5 cells grown in the absence of VP-16 for 2 years maintained resistance to VP-16, decreased levels of topoisomerase II, and attenuated ATP stimulation of VP-16-induced topoisomerase II/DNA binding, compared with K562 cells. Sequencing of cDNA coding for two consensus ATP binding sites and the active site tyrosine in the K/VP.5 topoisomerase II gene indicated that no mutations were present in these domains. In addition, single-strand conformational polymorphism analysis of restriction fragments encompassing the entire topoisomerase II cDNA revealed no evidence of mutations in the gene for this enzyme in K/VP.5 cells. Nuclear extracts from K562 (but not K/VP.5) cells contained a heat-labile factor that potentiated VP-16-induced topoisomerase II/DNA covalent complex formation in isolated nuclei from K/VP.5 cells. Immunoprecipitated topoisomerase II from K/VP.5 cells was 2.5-fold less phosphorylated, compared with enzyme from K562 cells. Collectively, our data suggest that acquired VP-16 resistance is mediated, at least in part, by altered levels or activity of a kinase that regulates topoisomerase II phosphorylation and hence drug-induced topoisomerase II/DNA covalent complex formation and stability.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ten children were treated with Escherichia coli L-asparaginase, and ten with Erwinia chrysanthemi L-asparaginase. L-asparaginase (ASP) treatment started halfway during ALL-induction treatment with vincristine, prednisone, daunorubicin and intrathecal methotrexate. The mean activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) level in all children demonstrated a significant fall (P < 0.001) from 28.25 sec at diagnosis to 23.0 sec at the start of ASP treatment. In this same time interval, the mean fibrinogen level declined markedly from 3 g/l to 1.2 g/l (P < 0.001), probably due to prednisone therapy. The APTT stayed shortened during ASP therapy, whereas the hypofibrinogenemia recovered significantly faster in the Erwinia group (P < or = 0.01). Factors (F) II, V, VII and X stayed within the normal range, while F VIII and F IX were elevated. During the entire period of induction therapy, the ATIII activity remained within the normal range in both treatment groups. The protein C values, however, demonstrated a steady decline from 140% at start of ASP treatment to a mean of 81% and 93%, respectively, at the end of the ASP therapy in the E. coli and Erwinia group. Five of the ten children treated with E. coli ASP demonstrated protein C levels below 70% at the end of ASP therapy, opposed to none of the Erwinia treated patients (P = 0.03). We suggest that the effect of ASP resulting in decreased coagulation factor synthesis is in part counterbalanced by the effect of prednisone on the coagulation system, when ASP is administered at the end of ALL induction treatment. The overall effect of ASP either of E. coli or of Erwinia on the hemorrhagic system reveals a slight imbalance towards thrombosis, mainly because of a gradual decrease in protein C activity. This imbalance is less pronounced in the Erwinia group.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using highly purified and interferon-gamma (IFN gamma) activated human monocytes, monocyte-mediated cytotoxicity (MMC) was evaluated in an MTT-based colorimetric cytotoxicity assay against six human leukemic cell lines (U937, THP1, KG1, K562, HL60, and 1,25(OH)2D3 differentiated HL60 cells) and cells from AML patients. Leukemic cells from cell lines with an immature phenotype were found to be resistant to MMC, whereas leukemic cells with a more mature and monocytic phenotype were sensitive. This paralleled the sensitivity to tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). AML cells from patients with an immature phenotype (FAB-M1/M5A) were significantly less sensitive to MMC as compared to more mature AML cells (FAB-M2/M4/M5B). The growth stimulatory effects of non-activated monocytes on immature AML cells could be abrogated in the presence of IFN gamma or IL-3 and GM-CSF. In addition, these cytokines further potentiated MMC, preferentially affecting cells with a more mature phenotype. AML cells with an immunologically immature phenotype (CD34(high), HLA-Dr(low), CD13(low), CD14(low)) were revealed as the least sensitive cells to MMC. The growth stimulatory effects of IL-3/GM-CSF with or without TNF-alpha on AML cells correlated with resistance to MMC. In addition, the cytolytic effects of TNF-alpha in the presence of IFN gamma correlated with an increased susceptibility of AML cells to MMC. In conclusion, our data strongly indicate that MMC is related to maturation in AML, which is correlated to the differential stimulatory and cytolytic effects of monocyte-derived cytokines such as IL-3, GM-CSF, and TNF-alpha.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast, after subcutaneous (s.c.) or intravenous (i.v.) transfer the DoHH2 cells displayed a hematogenous spread, and disseminated predominantly to hematopoietic and lymphoid organs including bone marrow, peripheral blood, spleen, peripheral lymph nodes, and liver. No involvement of the gut and mesenteric lymph nodes was observed, suggesting a specific homing pattern, bypassing the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT). This pattern is reminiscent of the human disease. Phenotypic analysis, cytogenetic analysis, and minor histocompatibility antigen (mHA) typing using mHA-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) clones performed on the original DoHH2 cell line and on DoHH2 cells recovered from mouse tissue, showed that in vivo passage did not alter the characteristics of the DoHH2 cells.

All patients receiving rIL-2/IFN alpha therapy developed peripheral blood eosinophilia of 20-40% peaking at 2-4 weeks of therapy. While on rIL-2/IFN alpha therapy the eosinophils became hypodense and hypersegmented. The antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxic activity (ADCC) of the eosinophils against the human B-cell lymphoma cell line (Raji) was depressed post-ABMT. Prolonged (28 days) in vivo rIL-2/IFN alpha immunotherapy enhanced ADCC activity of the eosinophils and brought them to normal levels. Similarly, rIL-2/IFN alpha immunotherapy enhanced the depressed cytotoxic activity of neutrophils post-ABMT to normal levels. Thus, eosinophils and neutrophils from rIL-2/IFN alpha-treated ABMT recipients may be targeted toward tumor cells by antibody, and express tumoricidal activity. No effect of rIL-2/IFN alpha was observed on monocyte-dependent ADCC activity which remained normal post-ABMT. We conclude that in addition to their effect on lymphocytes, cytokine-mediated immunotherapy consisting of subcutaneous low doses of riL-2 and IFN alpha may mediate their therapeutic effects in cancer therapy by increasing the number of eosinophils and enhancing the antitumor activity of eosinophils and neutrophils, provided that tumor-specific or tumor-associated antibodies are present.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast, in the MOLT-3 cells after addition of 2 microM of cytidine the proportion of CTP synthesized by conversion of UTP into CTP was substantially decreased, whereas the salvage of cytidine was proportionally increased. We conclude that the reutilization of uridine is a preferred route in the synthesis of CTP for MOLT-3 cells at physiological concentrations of uridine and cytidine, whereas in proliferating normal human T lymphocytes CTP is largely synthesized through reutilization of cytidine.

Clonally rearranged DNA became undetectable during LTMC in 12 studies (seven NHL, four MM, one CLL), and in seven of these studies the extent of the decrease determined by densitometric analysis of rearranged and germline bands on the autoradiograms was sufficient to demonstrate that preferential loss of neoplastic relative to other cell series had taken place.

However, little is known about the mechanisms leading to growth autonomy. Studies using immortalized murine hematopoietic cell lines have suggested that autocrine production of growth factors, or the constitutive activation of molecules in growth factor signalling pathways, are involved. We have established six spontaneous factor-independent cell lines from the human growth factor-dependent TF-1 cell line. The factor-independent cells showed no detectable growth factor activity. Immunoblotting analyses of tyrosine phosphorylation, Raf-1 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 (ERK-2) showed a similar pattern in all the cell lines including TF-1 cells. Furthermore, somatic-cell hybrids between TF-1 and the factor-independent cells grew in absence of growth factor. Taken together this data demonstrates that the factor independence in this system is dominant and suggests that the molecular event is located either downstream of the Raf-1 and MAP kinases pathway or on an alternative pathway.

The genetic mechanisms underlying the neoplastic transformation of FA hematopoietic cells are unknown. In this study, we have investigated the molecular features of hematopoiesis in the course of FA at different stages of the disease, including aplastic anemia, myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and AML. The analysis focused on defining the clonality status of FA hematopoiesis as well as the putative involvement of N-ras, a dominantly acting oncogene, and p53, a tumor suppressor gene, which are known to play a role in human hematopoietic tumors. Clonality of hematopoiesis was assessed by testing X-chromosome inactivation at the DXS255 locus, which displays different methylation patterns according to the activation status of the corresponding X homolog. Five out of seven FA cases analysed for clonality displayed monoclonal hematopoiesis, including one case at the aplastic anemia stage, three cases with MDS and one with AML. Mutations of the N-ras and p53 genes were studied by a combination of single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis and direct sequencing of the PCR product in the bone marrow and/or peripheral blood of 18 FA patients (seven with aplastic anemia, seven with MDS, four with AML). Only normal N-ras and p53 sequences were detected in all cases analyzed. These results suggest that monoclonal hematopoiesis is a frequent finding in the course of FA and may precede the onset of neoplasia in some cases. The genetic mechanisms underlying FA-associated leukemogenesis appear to be independent of N-ras and p53 mutations, which are relatively frequent events in myeloid tumors associated with other hematologic disorders.","['N-ras', 'p53']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several cases of APML with t(11;17) have recently been described, involving fusion of the RAR alpha gene with a new zinc finger gene named PLZF. We report here a second non-classical translocation, t(5;17), with a rearranged RAR alpha gene in a child with APML. Based on restriction endonuclease analysis, the rearrangement of RAR alpha occurred within the second intron, the common breakpoint site for t(15;17). The leukemic cells in the bone marrow aspirate were a mixture of hypergranular and hypogranular bilobed promyelocytes. Although less than 1% abnormal promyelocytes were identified after induction therapy, cytogenetics revealed persistent t(5;17). Therefore, the child was treated with all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA). There was no disease progression, and one marrow was interpreted as remission, with confirmation by cytogenetics which failed to reveal the translocation. However, disease reoccurred shortly after completion of ATRA. This poor response to ATRA may be an additional characteristic associated with non-classical translocations in APML. The identification of a second variant translocation involving the RAR alpha gene in APML suggests yet another RAR alpha rearrangement related to neoplastic myelopoiesis.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mutated p53, on the other hand, has a prolonged half-life and becomes detectable by this method, so that its detection by immunohistochemistry in solid tumors is almost synonymous with mutation. We assessed the value of immunocytochemical analysis of p53 protein on blood or bone marrow slides in the detection of p53 mutation in hematological malignancies, by comparison with single-stranded conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis of exons 4 to 10 of the P53 gene. One hundred and twenty eight patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL), myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), or chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) were studied by both methods. Immunocytochemistry showed detectable levels of intracellular p53 in 19 cases (including 2/19 AML, 2/21 ALL, 11/48 MDS, 4/40 CLL). Staining by p53 antibodies was restricted to the nucleus of blasts in AML, ALL, and MDS, and of lymphocytes in CLL. In 16 of the 19 cases, SSCP analysis, followed by direct sequencing, showed a p53 missense mutation in exons 4 to 8 of the gene. In the remaining three cases, where the number of cells stained by p53 antibodies was small, no p53 mutation could be detected. On the other hand, SSCP and sequence analysis identified a p53 mutation in two patients who had negative immunocytochemical findings. Both cases had a nonsense mutation, presumably leading to reduced levels of truncated p53. Thus, overall, immunocytochemistry and SSCP gave concordant results in 123 of the 128 (96%) patients analyzed. Our findings show that immunocytochemistry on blood and bone marrow smears is a sensitive method of p53 mutation detection in hematological malignancies, except in the rare patients with chain-terminating mutations. Positive immunocytochemistry is found in some patients with normal SSCP findings, and could correspond to overexpression of a non-mutated p53, but also to p53 mutation in a minor proportion of the malignant cells, undetectable by SSCP.","['MDM2', 'P53']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Six hours after differentiation induction, c-myc expression is down-regulated transiently. This was followed by the onset of cell differentiation together with a final c-myc 'down-regulation' at 24 h after treatment. This regulation of expression may be caused by hypermethylation of c-myc DNA sequences, which we find to follow a similar pattern. We propose that the loss of c-myc expression might be a necessary prerequisite for ara-C-induced differentiation. This hypothesis was tested by transfecting a constitutive c-myc expression construct into K562 cells prior to ara-C treatment. By following the differentiation parameters cell morphology, benzidine staining (hemoglobin monitored), and alkaline phosphatase activity (presence of mature red blood cell antigen monitored) in cells expressing cotransfected LacZ marker gene, it was demonstrated that the introduction of the c-myc expression plasmid blocked ara-C-induced differentiation.

We analyzed the effect of human recombinant IFN-gamma on the proliferation of leukemic lymphocytes isolated from the peripheral blood of a patient affected by a T-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (T-CLL). Incubation with IFN-gamma induced the proliferation of unstimulated leukemic cells. Cell proliferation was maximal after 6 days of culture with the cytokine; the half-maximal effect of IFN-gamma was observed at a concentration of approximately 800 U/ml. We also measured the production of IFN-gamma by leukemic cells. Cells incubated in control medium released small quantities of IFN-gamma activity, while the addition of low doses of the exogenous cytokine to the cell cultures induced high levels of IFN-gamma mRNA and protein production. Furthermore, anti-HLA class I monoclonal antibodies, that exert a mitogenic effect on these neoplastic lymphocytes, also induced the IFN-gamma gene expression in the same cells. These results indicate that IFN-gamma may stimulate the proliferation of human neoplastic T cells and suggest that this cytokine might have a role in the expansion of T-leukemic cell clones in vivo.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients were eligible for study if they had Rai intermediate or high-risk disease which had relapsed from or was refractory to conventional treatment. The initial cohort of patients received fludarabine 10 mg/m2/d days 1-5 and chlorambucil 20 mg/m2 days 1 and 15. Cycles were repeated every 28 days. Unacceptable toxicity was encountered in this cohort. The protocol was then modified to give chlorambucil 20 mg/m2 on day 1 (only).

However, there exists the possibility that the neoplastic event has occurred in a less mature clonally-related cell, such as a B lymphocyte, prior to Ig class switching. Since the presence of such a clonogenic cell could influence design of therapy, particularly with monoclonal antibodies, we have used the analysis of tumour-related VH genes to approach this question. Cloning and sequencing of PCR products from VH genes of tumour cells obtained from 4/4 patients with myeloma revealed significant mutation of the genes as compared to germ line sequences. In all cases the mutations were scattered throughout the variable region, with a pattern which did not indicate a role for antigen in selection. Importantly for therapy, multiple VH sequences from all patients were completely homogeneous, with no intraclonal variation. These findings indicate that, although IgM-positive clonogenic cells may exist, it is unlikely that they are involved in continuous maintenance of the malignant isotype-switched cell population. One possibility is that the B-cell progenitor population has to undergo further chromosomal changes to generate the malignant cell, and that this occurs at a more mature stage; in this case, antibody therapy should be aimed primarily at the more differentiated cells.",,,,,,"['GENBANK/Z33398', 'GENBANK/Z33399', 'GENBANK/Z33400', 'GENBANK/Z33401']",,,,,,,,

Routine cytogenetics revealed abnormal chromosome 13 in only 17% (4/23) of these patients. No correlation between Rb-1 deletion and tumor stage, immunoglobulin isotype, anemia, serum beta-2 microglobulin levels, patient age or the extent of prior therapy was found. However, the high incidence of Rb-1 deletion detected by FISH suggests a role of this tumor suppressor gene in the biology of MM. Although allelic loss of the Rb-1 gene is unlikely to be the only genetic change necessary for the development of MM, it may be a relatively early event in MM unrelated to chemotherapeutic intervention. Since the Rb-1 gene suppresses IL-6 production and secretion, Rb-1 deletion may result in deregulation of IL-6 expression and hence expansion of IL-6 dependent myeloma clones.",['Rb-1'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Only 14 of 48 infants treated on two consecutive MRC UKALL trials remain alive in first remission. Forty infants have subsequently been treated on a protocol incorporating further intensification with an option for high-dose chemotherapy and autologous or allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. The results show no improvement over previous trials largely due to the number of remission deaths; four of nine being associated with toxicity of 5 days of etoposide and cytarabine. Only three of 11 children treated by high-dose chemotherapy and transplantation remain alive in remission. Multivariate analysis of the factors influencing prognosis in all 88 infants showed that only age was significant. Event-free survival was 40% at 5 years for children over 26 weeks but under 10% for younger children. These results show the susceptibility of infants to the toxicity of intensive chemotherapy and do not support the use of short term high-dose chemotherapy alone in the management of infant leukaemia. Despite the unique biological features of infant ALL it appears that these patients also may benefit from longer courses of treatment with a maintenance (continuing) phase.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All patients have been followed at least 5 years. Patients in first CR at 5 years (FCR5) treated on protocols prior to CIHDAC had only 5% chance of relapse (median subsequent follow-up of 9 years). Therefore, we considered patients in FCR5 potentially cured. The two groups were similar with respect to known prognostic factors and CR rates. Although remission duration and survival were shorter with CIHDAC than Ad-OAP/AMSA-OAP, the percent of patients potentially cured was similar (10 vs. 15%). Marked differences between regimens were seen in inv(16) and t(15;17) patients. CIHDAC was better for patients with inv(16) with more patients in FCR5 (80 vs. 38%), longer remission duration and survival, and lower incidence of CNS relapse (0 vs. 43%). The Ad-OAP/AMSA-OAP protocols were superior in patients with t(15;17). We also measured steady-state ara-CTP concentrations (ara-CTPss) in 54 CIHDAC-treated patients presenting with high-blast count. While there was no correlation between ara-CTPss and response duration, all five patients in FCR5 in whom ara-CTPss was measured had high concentrations. These data support the concept that patients with AML should be treated differently according to cytogenetics.

The incidence of APL is generally considered to account for 3-9% of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) in children and approximately 10-15% in adults. Recently a single Italian pediatric institution reported that APL constituted one third of observed acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (AnLL) cases. Data from the AIEOP cooperative study group have confirmed that APL in Italy is more frequently observed in children as compared to other countries. Environmental and/or genetic factors should be considered to explain such differences. 2. Diagnosis of M3v.

Since the pol and env genes are dispensable for formation of RNA-containing particles, the gag gene product must have an RNA binding domain(s) capable of recognizing psi. To gain information about which portion(s) of Gag is required for RNA packaging in the avian sarcoma and leukemia virus system, we utilized a series of gag deletion mutants that retain the ability to assemble virus-like particles. COS cells were cotransfected with these mutant DNAs plus a tester DNA containing psi, and incorporation of RNA into particles were measured by RNase protection. The efficiency of packaging was determined by normalization of the amount of psi+ RNA to the amount of Gag protein released in virus-like particles. Specificity of packaging was determined by comparisons of psi+ and psi- RNA in particles and in cells. The results indicate that much of the MA domain, much of the p10 domain, half of the CA domain, and the entire PR domain of Gag are unnecessary for efficient packaging. In addition, none of these deleted regions is needed for specific selection of the psi RNA. Deletions within the NC domain, as expected, reduce or eliminate both the efficiency and the specificity of packaging. Among mutants that retain the ability to package, a deletion within the CA domain (which includes the major homology region) is the least efficient. We also examined particles of the well-known packaging mutant SE21Q1b. The data suggest that the random RNA packaging behavior of this mutant is not due to a specific defect but rather is the result of the cumulative effect of many point mutations throughout the gag gene.",['gag'],PMC237002,,,,,,,,,,,,

The etiologic agent of MAIDS is a defective murine leukemia virus that is deleted of most of its pol and env genes and appears to encode a single protein, the Gag precursor Pr60gag protein. Pr60gag is myristylated and attached to the plasma membrane. To study the role myristylation on the function of Pr60gag, we have generated a myristylation-negative (Myr-) mutant of the MAIDS defective virus. We found that Myr- Pr60gag interacted less tightly with the plasma membrane. In addition, the Myr- MAIDS defective virus mutant was unable to induce expansion of infected cells and was nonpathogenic. These results emphasize the essential role of Pr60gag in the disease process. Our data also suggest that Pr60gag, once recruited to the cell membrane through its myristylation, interacts with other membrane-bound effectors to send signals to induce proliferation of the infected cells and to initiate immune dysfunctions.",,PMC236966,,,,,,,,,,,,

The age of initiation of DR is not as important a determinant as the duration of DR in regard to incidence and age of onset.

These were stained with a broad panel of antibodies (n = 23) against various leukocyte antigens, among them 11 macrophage-associated antibodies (MAAs): Ki-M1p, MAC387, HAM56, LN5, KP1 (CD68), PG-M1 (CD68), Ki-M4p, DAKO-DRC (CD35), and antibodies against lysozyme, alpha 1-antichymotrypsin, and S100 protein. The French-American-British (FAB) classification subtypes of the AML cases, as determined by enzyme-cytochemical and/or immunocytological investigation of bone marrow smears, were as follows: M1 = 6, M2 = 5, M4 = 7, M5 = 3, and AML (not classified) = 2. The 13 cases of ALL were classified as follows: c-ALL (pre-B-ALL) = 7, B-ALL = 3, T-ALL = 2, and ALL (not classified) = 1. All the MAAs except LN5, Ki-M4p, and DAKO-DRC stained blast cells in AML. However, the number of stained blast cells varied considerably within and between the individual subtypes (M4/5 > M2/1). Using Fisher's exact test a significant difference in frequency of blast cell staining between AML and ALL was found for four MAAs (anti-lysozyme, MAC387, Ki-M1p, and KP1) and two of the three myeloid cell markers applied (Ki-My2p and anti-neutrophil elastase). Of these six antibodies, the combination of anti-lysozyme and KP1 can be recommended for use in routine diagnostics for the differentiation of AML from ALL on the basis of immunohistochemical staining because both of these antibodies were found to stain a relatively large percentage of cases of AML but none of ALL. However, none of the MAAs were found to discriminate reliably between the FAB M4/5 and M1/2 subtypes of AML.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated potential factors confounding 8-OHdG determination and, based on the results, then determined the 8-OHdG levels in human peripheral blood leukocytes. 8-OHdG was detected electrochemically after extraction of DNA from the cells without the use of phenol by a DNA extractor under helium. In the preliminary experiments, the mononuclear leukocytes (MN) in blood samples obtained from 19 laboratory workers and students were separated from the polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) with Mono-Poly resolving medium. The 8-OHdG in the MN (1.157 +/- 0.414 molecules per 10(5) deoxyguanosine) did not differ significantly from that in PMN (1.131 +/- 0.418). The effect of red blood cells (RBC) on 8-OHdG formation during DNA extraction was then examined by adding RBC to the human lymphoblastoid cell line FA72. Addition of RBC at ratios of up to 4 RBC per FA72 cell did not increase 8-OHdG levels, while addition at a RBC/FA72 cell ratio of 20 increased the 8-OHdG level 1.43-fold over that without RBC. The potential effect of histidine, a scavenger of both hydroxyl radicals and singlet oxygen, on reduction of artificial 8-OHdG formation during DNA extraction was examined during DNA extraction in the human promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL60. Addition of His decreased the 8-OHdG level dose-dependently (30% reduction at 30 mM His concentration). Based on these results, we determined the 8-OHdG levels in human leukocyte samples obtained from 79 healthy male factory workers aged 24-59 years. The leukocyte fraction containing both MN and PMN was separated from RBC with Mono-Poly resolving medium and DNA was extracted from the leukocytes in the presence of 30 mM His. The mean 8-OHdG level in these samples was 1.072 +/- 0.230. To evaluate the reliability of the assay, FA72 was used as a standard sample in all assay determinations and the 8-OHdG levels of both the leukocyte samples and the FA72 sample(s) were measured in each determination. The inter- and intra-assay coefficients of variation (CV) were calculated to be 14.4% (n = 14) and 3.9-13.5% (n = 3-5 per assay) respectively. The 8-OHdG level was measured twice in 19 leukocyte samples; the value at the first determination was not correlated with that at the second determination. The range of 8-OHdG levels in the samples was relatively small compared with the CV of the assay.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Comparison of partial sequences of small subunit rRNA from normal and putative cancer cells was performed to resolve this issue. These studies showed a close phylogenetic relationship of the different forms of cancer cells to each other (similarity coefficient, 0.982), to the normal hemocytes (similarity coefficient, 0.990, 0.992), and to the oyster, Crassostrea virginica (similarity coefficient, 0.895-0.927).

We analyzed the pattern of growth in Dexter culture of the bone marrow fraction infused in 52 patients with malignant diseases and subjected to autologous transplantation. In 23 cases, bone marrow cells had previously been treated in vitro with Asta-Z 7654 (n = 7) or with monoclonal antibodies plus complement (n = 16). Some of the long-term bone marrow culture parameters seemed to correlate with grafting kinetics, mainly adherent cell layer development and persistence of committed hematopoietic progenitors (CFU-GM) in the supernatant cells. The absence of a stromal layer defined a group with very poor hematological recovery after transplantation. Nine cases were included in this group and only one patient (11%) had recovered granulocytes and platelets. However, 90% of patients whose long-term cultures displayed normal adherent cell behavior had recovered peripheral hematological values.

Results of 951 patients with malignant disease transplanted from HLA-matched siblings are reported. Both Campath-1M and Campath-1G are shown to be effective when used in vitro for prevention of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Graft failure was reduced by addition of cyclosporin A (CsA) post-transplant and possibly also by total lymphoid irradiation (TLI) pre-transplant. However, treatment of the recipient with Campath-1G to deplete residual lymphocytes was more effective, reducing the incidence of graft failure from 21% to 9% (in the absence of CsA). GVHD was virtually eliminated and leukaemia-free survival was improved. However, the risk of relapse was increased by T cell depletion, certainly in CML and to a lesser extent in AML. Addition of donor T cells to the depleted bone marrow or early post-transplant restored the risks of GVHD, graft failure and relapse to much the same as without T cell depletion. One problem associated with the use of Campath-1G in vivo was a significant delay (by up to 7 days) in neutrophil engraftment. This was unlikely to be caused by toxicity to progenitor cells and we argue that small numbers of lymphocytes may be required to assist early engraftment, possibly by cytokine production. If this problem can be overcome, T cell depletion of donor and recipient may be a good alternative to conventional GVHD prophylaxis for matched sibling transplants, resulting in a superior quality of life for the survivors. It is also likely to be particularly beneficial in transplants for non-malignant diseases and transplants from unrelated donors.",,,,['Bone Marrow Transplant. 1995 Feb;15(2):327.

All patients had evidence of gonadal insufficiency prior to BMT in that their basal and human menopausal gonadotrophin (HMG)-stimulated oestradiol (E2) levels were significantly lower than those of control subjects. The patients also had markedly higher basal FSH levels and exaggerated responses to 100 micrograms iv gonadotrophin release hormone bolus compared with those of control subjects. However, the conditioning regimens employed prior to BMT, i.e. cytotoxic chemotherapy (CT) and total body irradiation (TBI), acting either singly or in combination, caused further ovarian damage. As a result, their gonadotrophins rose further into the menopausal range. Their oestradiol secretion diminished and ovaries became almost unresponsive 3-4 months after BMT.

All patients developed menopausal symptoms and became amenorrhoeic during this period. Contrary to expectation, the hormonal changes occurring acutely were similar in patients undergoing radiation-based regimens and those conditioned with high-dose chemotherapy alone. Also, the severity of ovarian dysfunction appeared independent of age at transplantation, the nature of the conditioning-regimen or the type of transplant. Gonadotrophic, thyrotrophic, lactotrophic and adrenocorticotrophic secretions were unaffected. These data indicate that the ovary suffers an acute insult during short-term chemotherapy but the anterior pituitary gland retains its trophic hormone reserve and secretory capacity.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The expression of PKC gamma significantly attenuated antigen-induced responses including hydrolysis of inositol phospholipids, increase in cytosolic calcium, and secretion of granules but enhanced antigen-induced release of arachidonic acid. Instead of a sustained increase in cytosolic calcium, antigen now induced calcium oscillations; possibly as a consequence of suppression of the phospholipase C activity and incomplete emptying of internal calcium stores. In addition, PKC gamma appeared to inhibit activation of other PKC isozymes because phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate failed to act synergistically with the Ca(2+)-ionophore on secretion. This was confirmed in other studies where PKC gamma was shown to suppress the transduction of stimulatory signals by other isozymes of PKC on provision of these isozymes to PKC-depleted permeabilized cells.

We show that both LIF and IL-6 mRNA are constitutively expressed, albeit at extremely low levels, in most tissues. While it is unclear whether this low level of expression is of biological significance, it is possible that it reflects a local mode of action of these potent polyfunctional molecules. Lipopolysaccharide, the bacterial cell wall product responsible for endotoxic shock, when administered in vivo, was capable of inducing the expression of both LIF and IL-6 in all of the tissues examined. In addition, LIF and IL-6 expression was induced in lung tissue by in vitro culturing in serum-free media.

A total of 138 human leukemia and virus-transformed cell lines were studied and the levels of HGF were measured by ELISA. A significant amount of HGF was detected in a variety of cell lines, including one T, four B, five non-T non-B, eight myeloid one erythroid and two EBV-transformed B cell lines. The amount of HGF spontaneously produced by three of the myeloid cell lines, KCL-22 (33.48 ng/ml), KG-1A (26.21 ng/ml), and KG-1 (18.81 ng/ml), is comparable to the amount produced by human embryonic lung fibroblast cells, known as high HGF-producers. Biological assays together with Western blot analyses verified that the immunoreactive HGF detected in the culture supernatant of haematopoietic cell lines had the same properties as authentic HGF. Moreover, HGF mRNA was detected in high HGF producers by Northern blot analysis.

However, it is not yet clear if OM binding to gp130 requires accessory factor(s) and if gp130 alone can mediate OM signalling. Here we report that: (a) expressing murine gp130 in BAF-B03 cells (BAF-m130) resulted in the appearance of a single class of low-affinity OM binding sites; (b) chemical cross-linking studies with 125I-OM identified a 180 kDa labelled complex on BAF-m130 cells; (c) OM cross-linking to the H2981 cell line which expresses both low- and high-affinity OM receptor, identified a 180 kDa and an additional 280 kDa species; (d) 125I-OM was specifically cross-linked to soluble recombinant gp130 (sgp130-Rg) in solution; and (e) the cellular proliferation of BAF-m130 was unaffected by OM treatment. These data indicate that gp130 can act as the low-affinity receptor for OM, however, gp130-OM interactions alone are unable to elicit cellular proliferation. This suggests that an additional factor(s) are required to interact with the OM/gp130 complex to form the high-affinity functional receptor. We propose that the 280 kDa species detected on H2981 cells is likely a complex of OM, gp130, and the putative beta chain of the functional OM high-affinity receptor.

In most cases, IL-1 induced differentiation characterized by increments of sIg gamma+, sIg mu+ and PCA-1+ cells, and a decrement of CD5+ cells, and activation characterized by increments of CD23+ and HC2+ cells, but induced the proliferation of leukemic cells only in two HCL-V cases.

The IL-2 gene displays both T cell specific and inducible expression: it is only expressed in CD4+ T cells after antigenic or mitogenic stimulation. Several cis-acting regulatory sites are required for induction of the IL-2 gene after stimulation. In this study, we have analysed the function of these cis-acting regulatory sites in the context of the native IL-2 enhancer and promoter sequence. The results of this study suggest that the NFAT (-276 to -261), the distal octamer (-256 to -248) and the proximal octamer (-75 to -66) sites not only act as enhancers of IL-2 gene transcription in the presence of cellular stimulation, but also have a silencing effect on IL-2 gene expression in resting cells. Two other sites display disparate effects on IL-2 gene expression in different T leukemia cell lines: the distal purine box (-291 to -277) and the proximal purine box sites (-145 to -128). Finally, the AP-1 (-186 to -176) and the kappa B sites (-206 to -195) respond to different cellular activation in EL4 cells.

Complications related to the bacteremia were observed in 10 episodes: unilateral pulmonary infiltrates (4), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (4), hypotension (3), and endocarditis (2). All patients with ARDS had received high doses of cytosine arabinoside and had bacteremia due to Streptococcus mitis. Death occurred in three patients (12%) but was possibly related to bacteremia in only one case. Case patients who had received prophylaxis with quinolones were compared with matched control patients who received similar prophylaxis but who did not have bacteremia due to viridans streptococci. Multivariate analysis of predisposing factors showed that high doses of cytosine arabinoside (P = .01), the presence of mucositis (P = .02), and the absence of previous therapy with parenteral antibiotics (P = .01) were independent risk factors for the development of viridans streptococcal bacteremia. Of 259 patients who had received quinolone prophylaxis during the study period, 22 (8.5%) developed an episode of viridans streptococcal bacteremia as compared with three episodes (3.7%) in 82 patients who had received a quinolone and penicillin (P = .07).

Sequencing of clones of DNA amplified in six independent PCR reactions confirmed that the 3' portion of this RCR was composed of retroviral envelope sequences unique to pPAM3 joined to a 3' long terminal repeat (LTR) unique to G1Na. Comparison of pPAM3 and G1Na sequences at the site corresponding to this junction revealed a short segment of patchy nucleotide identity (8 out of 10 bp), suggesting that these helper and vector sequences were joined by homologous recombination.

The uptake and incorporation of [14C]cytidine into cellular ribonucleotides and RNA, respectively, were not decreased by 3-AP or 3-AMP; however, the incorporation of cytidine into DNA via ribonucleotide reductase was inhibited markedly. Thus, a pronounced decrease in the formation of [14C]deoxyribonucleotides from radioactive cytidine occurred in the acid-soluble fraction of 3-AP- and 3-AMP-treated L1210 cells. Consistent with an inhibition of DNA replication that occurred at relatively low concentrations of 3-AP and 3-AMP, cells gradually accumulated in the S-phase of the cell cycle; at higher concentrations of 3-AP and 3-AMP, a more rapid accumulation of cells in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle occurred, with the loss of the S-phase population, implying that a second less sensitive metabolic lesion was created by the HCTs. N-Acetylation of 3-AMP resulted in a compound that was 10-fold less active as an inhibitor of ribonucleotide reductase activity and 8-fold less active as an inhibitor of L1210 cell growth. N-Acetylation of either 5-AP or 5-AMP did not alter the inhibitory properties of these compounds. The results obtained provide an experimental rationale for the further development of the HCTs, particularly 3-AP and 3-AMP, as potential drugs for clinical use in the treatment of cancer.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we have utilized natural mammalian membranes from U937 monocytes to determine whether two purified 14 kDa PLA2 isoenzymes (Type I, Type II) and a partially purified 110 kDa PLA2 exhibit substrate selectivity for certain fatty acids or phospholipids. In these studies, arachidonic acid (AA) release from membranes was measured under conditions where the remodelling of AA mediated by CoA-independent transacylase (CoA-IT) activity has been eliminated. In agreement with the mixed-vesicle models, AA was the major unsaturated fatty acid hydrolysed from membranes by the 110 kDa PLA2, suggesting that this PLA2 is selective in releasing AA from natural membranes. By contrast, Type I and Type II PLA2s were less selective in releasing AA from phospholipids and released a variety of unsaturated fatty acids at molar ratios that were proportional to the ratios of these fatty acids in U937 microsomal membranes. Examination of AA release from phospholipid classes indicated that all three enzymes released AA from the major AA-containing phospholipid classes (phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylcholine, and phosphatidylinositol) of U937 membranes. The 110 kDa PLA2 released AA from phospholipid subclasses in ratios that were proportional to the AA content within phospholipid classes and subclasses of U937 membranes. These data suggested that the 110 kDa PLA2 shows no preference either for the sn-1 linkage or for the sn-3 phosphobase moiety of phospholipids. By contrast, Type I and Type II PLA2s preferentially released AA from ethanolamine-containing phospholipids and appeared to prefer the 1-acyl-linked subclass. Taken together, these data indicate that the 110 kDa PLA2 selectively releases AA from U937 membranes, whereas Type I and Type II PLA2 release a variety of unsaturated fatty acids. Furthermore, the 110 kDa PLA2 releases the same molar ratios of AA from all major phospholipid subclasses, whereas Type I and Type II PLA2s show some specificity for phosphatidylethanolamine when these enzymes are incubated with a complex mammalian membrane substrate.",,PMC1137047,,,['Biochem J 1994 Dec 15;304(Pt 3):1023'],,,,,,,,,

Two-color immunohistochemical analysis revealed that the p53-positive cells were also positive for the myeloid cell marker. Half of the MDS cases that evolved to overt leukemia (seven of 14) exhibited positive p53 reaction in the bone marrow at the time of initial diagnosis. This frequency (50%) was significantly higher than that in de novo acute myeloid leukemia cases. All of the seven MDS cases that exhibited p53 expression at the time of initial diagnosis developed overt leukemia later, and p53 expression was maintained throughout the progression of MDS. The results suggest that p53 mutations that occur in the myeloid cells in MDS may confer a growth advantage to these cells resulting in the progression to overt leukemia.

Recently, post-radiation gliomas have been reported. METHODS: The authors review 88 cases of cerebral glioma following radiotherapy in patients operated for neoplasms of the nervous system, including 6 personal cases of post-radiation gliomas treated in the Neurosurgical Division of the Department of Neurological Sciences, ""La Sapienza"" University, Rome. The criteria used to define this unusual pathologic association are discussed. RESULTS: There was a male predominance. Post-radiation gliomas were particularly malignant, the average dose was 33 Gy, and average free latency was 9.6 years. The first disease was most frequently acute lymphatic leukemia. CONCLUSIONS: Post-radiation gliomas have particular features but do not present a histologic or clinical behavior different from analogous spontaneous gliomas. The fact that 88 cases have been reported in recent years suggests that a thorough biological, clinical studies be carried out on this association.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The short-term TCDO therapy reduced the acute death rate markedly, but survival rates after 4 months were similar with and without TCDO. The first malignancy after TBI occurred on day 103, and over the lifetime of the animals the tumor incidence in the group given TBI (11 Gy) without TCDO treatment was 73% vs 20% in animals with short-term TCDO therapy after TBI. In particular, there was a highly significant prevention of radiation-induced leukemia [P (one-sided) < 0.001] by TCDO, and a significantly reduced incidence of malignant epithelial tumors [P (one-sided) < 0.05]. The development of sarcomas was not affected by TCDO. Long-term survival was not enhanced by TCDO due to the occurrence of bronchopneumonial infections about 1 year after TBI.

The reconstitution of these cells with defined concentrations of either PKC-beta or PKC-epsilon up to 10 nM and 20 nM, respectively, induced c-fos and c-jun in a dose-dependent manner. At high concentrations of PKC-beta and -epsilon the induction of c-fos and c-jun was independent of the aggregation of the high-affinity IgE receptors (Fc epsilon type I receptors). In contrast, at limiting concentrations of these two PKC isozymes, 1 nM, the increase in c-fos and c-jun mRNAs was dependent on the aggregation of the Fc epsilon type I receptors. Unlike PKC-beta and -epsilon, PKC-alpha and PKC-delta failed to reconstitute c-fos and c-jun induction at any dose over the range examined.

Inoculation of nontumorigenic doses of live Eb or Eb-IL4 cells led to long-lasting specific and systemic T-cell-mediated antitumor response requiring both CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes. Irradiated cells offered only limited short-term protection, which could be marginally improved by IL4. The more effective protection offered by vaccination with live tumor cells correlated with rapid migration and persistence of tumor cells in the bone marrow of host animals after tumor cell inoculation. In contrast, irradiated Eb-lacZ cells had a short persistence. Tumor cells recovered from the bone marrow of host animals injected with live Eb-IL4 cells still expressed IL4. These observations indicate that in the course of vaccination with live Eb or Eb-IL4 cells, a fraction of these cells escaped destruction by host mechanisms and persisted in a dormant state in the bone marrow for long periods of time.

A number of observations argue against the widely held view that these reactions result from the interaction between antileukocyte antibodies in the recipient and leukocytes in the platelet product. We sought to determine whether substances in the plasma or the cells in the product cause reactions to transfused platelets. METHODS: We separated standard platelet concentrates into their plasma and cellular components and then transfused both portions in random order. Patients were monitored for reactions during all transfusions. Before each transfusion, the concentration of cytokines (interleukin-1 beta and interleukin-6) was measured in the platelet products. Studies were also performed on the platelet products to determine the effect of storage on the concentration of cytokines. RESULTS: Sixty-four pairs of platelet-product components (the plasma supernatant and the cells) were administered to 12 patients. There were 20 reactions to the plasma supernatant and 6 reactions to the cells (chi-square = 6.50, P = 0.009). Eight transfusions were associated with reactions to both products. The plasma component was more likely to cause severe reactions than the cells (chi-square = 9.6, P < 0.01). A strong positive correlation was observed between the reactions and the concentration of interleukin-1 beta and interleukin-6 in the plasma supernatant (P < 0.001 and P = 0.034, respectively). In vitro studies demonstrated that interleukin-1 beta and interleukin-6 concentrations rise progressively in stored platelets and that these concentrations are related to the leukocyte count in the platelet product. CONCLUSIONS: Bioreactive substances in the plasma supernatant of the platelet product cause most febrile reactions associated with platelet transfusions. Removing the plasma supernatant before transfusion can minimize or prevent these reactions.",,,,['N Engl J Med. 1994 Sep 8;331(10):670-1. PMID: 8052278'],,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: The relationship of the binomial and the beta distributions is explained. For cohort studies in which deaths are counted in exposed and unexposed groups exact confidence limits on the relative risk are found conditional on the total number of observed deaths. A similar method for the SMR is justified by analogy between the SMR and the relative risk found from such cohort studies, and the fact that the relevant (beta) distribution does not require integer parameters. SOURCE OF DATA: Illustrative examples of hypothetical data were used, together with a MINITAB macro (see appendix) to perform the calculations. MAIN RESULTS: Exact confidence intervals that include error in the expected number are much wider than those found with the standard exact method. Fieller intervals are comparable with the new exact method provided the observed and expected numbers (taken to be means of Poisson variates) are large enough to approximate normality. As the expected number is increased, the standard method gives results closer to the new method, but may still lead to different conclusions even with as many as 100 expected. CONCLUSIONS: If there is reason to suppose the expected number of deaths in an SMR is subject to sampling error (because of imprecisely estimated rates in the standard population) then exact confidence limits should be found by the methods described here, or approximate Fieller-based limits provided enough events are observed and expected to approximate normality.",,PMC1059966,,,['J Epidemiol Community Health 1995 Apr;49(2):224'],,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Geographical incidence study. SETTING: The Kirkwall postcode area of Scotland. SUBJECTS: Children and young adults resident in the area in the period 1968-91. MAIN RESULTS: Observed numbers of cases of leukaemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and observed to expected ratios with expected numbers based on Scottish national rates were determined.

CONCLUSION: The observation of an excess of borderline statistical significance in 1985-91 following the substantial excess incidence which occurred in the early 1980s suggests that the incidence of leukaemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in this area should continue to be a matter of concern. The phenomenon of high incidences of childhood and young adult leukaemia and lymphoma near some nuclear installations in isolated areas is yet to be explained, but certain aspects of the data examined in the present report are consistent with the hypothesis of an infectious aetiology for leukaemia in very young children.",,PMC1059952,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present work has examined the involvement of Src-like protein-tyrosine kinases in the response of irradiated HL-60 myeloid leukemia cells. The results demonstrate little if any effect of IR on p59fyn, p56lck, and pp60c-src activity. In contrast, HL-60 cells responded to x-ray exposure with activation of p56/p53lyn. At a dose of 200 centigrays, induction of p56/p53lyn activity was detectable at 15 min. Doses as low as 50 centigrays were effective in activating p56/p53lyn. H2O2 and the scavenger N-acetylcysteine had no detectable effect on p56/p53lyn activation, while the protein-tyrosine kinase inhibitors, herbimycin and genistein, blocked induction by IR. The results also demonstrate that incubation of a glutathione S-transferase-Lyn fusion protein with lysates of irradiated HL-60 cells is associated with binding of the cell cycle regulatory protein, p34cdc2. The interaction of p56/p53lyn and p34cdc was confirmed in similar experiments with a glutathione S-transferase-Cdc2 fusion protein. Moreover, coimmunoprecipitation studies demonstrate the selective binding of activated p56/p53lyn to p34cdc2 in irradiated cells.

UTI is present both in the lysate of tumor cells (human choriocarcinoma SMT-cc1 cells, human promyeloid leukemia U937 cells, and murine Lewis lung carcinoma 3LL cells) and human neutrophils. In each medium from tumor cells, most of the cell-associated UTI is on the cell surface. Cell-binding experiments employing cell enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and flow cytometry indicated that tumor cells (SMT-cc1 and 3LL cells) have specific binding sites for UTI on their cell surface. UTI binds rapidly and with relatively high affinity to SMT-cc1 and 3LL cells. UTI is bound to a specific surface receptor that is incompletely saturated. U937 cells and neutrophils did not show any specific binding to UTI, since UTI receptors on the cell surface of U937 cells and neutrophils were completely saturated with endogenous UTI. UTI forms yielded cross-linked 150- and 80-kDa ligand receptor complexes with cultured SMT-cc1 cells, suggesting molecular masses of 110 and 40 kDa for the UTI receptors. Purification of the two UTI receptor proteins by ligand affinity chromatography (ligand-blotting analysis) yielded two bands when analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, corresponding in electrophoretic mobility to those calculated by cross-linking analysis.

In order to define the regions important for transcriptional regulation of the mouse ferritin H gene, we have linked the promoter, including the transcription start site, and 5 kilobases of upstream sequence to a reporter gene (human growth hormone). This construct and a series of 5' deletion mutants have been used to transfect erythroid (K562, mouse erythroleukemia (MEL)) and hepatoma (HepG2) cell lines. Measurement of growth hormone in the culture medium and analysis of ferritin-growth hormone transcripts by a ribonuclease protection assay revealed that a 140-base pair minimal promoter is sufficient to confer a high level of expression to the reporter gene in both cell types. In addition, a 180-base pair fragment, lying 4.5 kilobases upstream of the ferritin transcription start site, functions like an inducible enhancer during N,N'-hexamethylene-bis-acetamide-induced differentiation of MEL cells. A perfect match to a consensus binding motif to the erythroid transcription factor NF-E2 is present in this regulatory element, but the mutant NF-E2 enhancer retains the inducible activity in stably transfected MEL cells, and the results from gel retardation assays suggest that protein-DNA complexes that form in vitro between the ferritin enhancer and MEL nuclear extracts do not contain NF-E2. Thus, nuclear factors that mediate inducibility of the ferritin enhancer remain to be identified.",,,,,,['GENBANK/M85257'],,,,,,,,

We report here that the long terminal repeat (LTR) of Moloney murine leukemia virus encodes a novel trans-activator, which induces transcription and expression of class I major histocompatibility complex genes. The portion of the LTR responsible for trans-activation lies within the U3 region and can be excised from the LTR while maintaining its activity. Analysis of the U3 region of the LTR and its flanking sequences suggests that functional or regulatory elements for the trans-activity exist between nucleotides 32 and 219 of the LTR sequences.

DAH is also active in vivo against Friend virus (FV-P)-induced erythroleukemia. Treatment with DAH, given for 95 days as a single daily i.p. injection to DBA/2 mice 3 days following FV-P inoculation, induced a marked increase of 212% in the mean survival time (MST) of treated animals. Since FV-P-induced erythroleukemia is characterized by the proliferation of mature erythroid precursors, we examined the effect of DAH treatment on erythroid colony-forming cells (CFU-E) and observed that the number of CFU-E per spleen was 30 times lower in DAH-treated mice than in the controls. To gain further insight into the early effects of DAH treatment on the early phase of Friend disease, we examined the effects of short DAH treatment on spleen size, hematocrit and viremia in FV-P-infected mice.

The resulting hybridomas were divided into three groups in terms of their susceptibility to apoptosis following exposure to A23187: (1) hybridomas highly sensitive to apoptosis, (2) hybridomas with intermediate sensitivity to apoptosis which occurs later and to a lesser extent, and (3) hybridomas resistant to apoptosis. However, growth inhibition after 72 h of incubation and an initial rise in intracellular free calcium concentrations induced by A23187 were similar in the three groups. Expression of Ca(2+)-independent/Mg(2+)-dependent endonuclease, which had an optimal pH of 7.5-8.5 and was inhibited by Zn2+, was correlated with the susceptibility of the hybridomas to A23187-induced apoptosis.

Since LIF-deficient mice do not exhibit overt phenotypic effects in cell types known to be targets for LIF action in vitro, we examined the ability of IL-6, OSM, and CNTF to reproduce the effects of LIF in five different bioassays. OSM, CNTF, and LIF are able to promote embryonic stem cell growth and to maintain them in an undifferentiated state as marked by a high alkaline phosphatase activity (ED50 are, respectively, 0.5, 3 and 1 ng/ml). Whereas LIF and OSM maintain close to 100% of ES cells in an undifferentiated state, CNTF, at optimal concentrations, prevents differentiation of only 60% of the ES population. Murine 7TD1 hybridoma cell growth is induced only in the presence of IL-6 (ED50 = 0.1 ng/ml). Both LIF and OSM stimulate DA1a cell proliferation (ED50 are, respectively, 1 and 12 ng/ml). OSM appears, therefore, to act as a weak agonist of LIF-dependent processes on murine cells, however, with a 10-fold lower specific activity than that of LIF, which is in agreement with human OSM cross-reacting with the murine LIF-R. Though IL-6, LIF, and OSM all stimulate haptoglobin and fibrinogen production by human HepG2 hepatoma cells, the dose-response curves of these three factors exhibit very different characteristics. CNTF stimulates acute-phase protein production by HepG2 cells only at high concentrations (greater than 1 microgram/ml). A549 epithelial cells are subjected to growth inhibition only in the presence of OSM (ED50 = 6 ng/ml), even though they expressed LIF-R and gp130 transcripts. These data suggest that OSM and LIF act on human cells through different receptors. Altogether, these results indicate that none of the factors examined in this study are precisely interchangeable in terms of their biological actions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Of 203 autopsy patients with malignant disease, seven (7.7%) were diagnosed with disseminated Trichosporon beigelii infection by immunohistochemical investigation of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections. Including these seven, a total of 43 patients with Trichosporon beigelii infection have been reported in Japan. The majority of them had underlying hematologic malignancies, for which they received cytotoxic chemotherapy resulting in neutropenia.

Furthermore, reconstitution of the immune system in a BMT recipient who was a hepatitis surface antigen (HBsAg)+/HBV DNA+ carrier with HBV immune bone marrow cells led to clearance of the replicating virus, presumably through adoptive cell-mediated immunotherapy. We report three cases of induction of immunity to HBV by selective adoptive transfer by i.v. injection of peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) obtained from BMT donors who were actively immunized against HBV after harvesting of bone marrow. All three BMT recipients developed anti-HBs antibodies. In one BMT case in whom antibodies to HBsAg developed following adoptive transfer of immune PBL, a mild booster effect was documented in the BMT recipient upon immunization with a recombinant hepatitis B vaccine. The two remaining patients lost their antibodies to HBsAg in association with relapse of leukaemia. This immune manipulation may open the door to evaluation of adoptive transfer of immunity to HBV through selective transplantation of HBV immune lymphocytes in selected patients such as those with persistent HBV infection, as well as liver transplant recipients who require protection of the graft against HBV re-infection.",,PMC1534692,,,,,,,,,,,,

A major limitation of this therapeutic approach has been the inability of most MABs to kill the cell once bound to the target antigen. We have previously reported the development of two murine IgM MABs, WM63 (CD48) and WM66 (unclustered), that react with panleucocyte antigens widely expressed on cells from lymphoproliferative disorders, and are lytic with human complement. These antibodies have subsequently been administered intravenously to patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) in a Phase One trial. Seven patients with progressive CLL received increasing daily doses of WM66 (Patients 1-3) or WM63 (Patients 4-7), with one patient also receiving a continuous infusion of WM63 over 20 hours. All patients demonstrated a significant but transient reduction in the number of circulating leucocytes, and no overall effect on disease progression was observed. Antibody coating of circulating lymphocytes was seen in patients receiving WM-63. Patients receiving large doses of WM63 (cases 5-7) demonstrated a decline in complement levels during treatment. There were no major adverse reactions to WM66, but two patients developed dose limiting side effects to WM63. No human anti-mouse antibody (HAMA) responses were documented. These findings indicate that in vitro cytotoxicity mediated by Mabs fixing human complement correlates poorly with clinical responses, and support earlier observations which indicate that cell-mediated cytotoxicity is necessary for effective antibody therapy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Diminished surface expression of the TCR alpha beta/CD3 complex is a specific feature of ATL cells. Since the gene transcript for each chain of this complex has been detected and surface expression of this complex is further decreased, accompanied by the induction of IL2R alpha chain, after stimulation with anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody (mAb), the TCR alpha beta/CD3 complex is considered to be down-modulated in vivo. We recently reported four ATL patients whose leukemic cells were CD4-, CD8- (double-negative; DN), TCR alpha beta+. These DN-ATL cells expressed S100 beta protein which was not detected in CD4+ ATL cells. Similar to CD4+ ATL cells, surface expression of the TCR alpha beta/CD3 complex on DN-ATL cells was decreased in vivo despite the lack of CD4 or CD8 as coreceptor. Therefore, the TCR alpha beta+ T-cell with or without CD4 is the sole target of HTLV-I induced leukemia and the down-modulation of the TCR alpha beta/CD3 complex is considered to play a key role in the development of ATL.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The incidence of positivities for stem cell antigens, CD34 and HLA-DR, on blasts in t(8;21) AML is higher in comparison with those in other M2 or M3 categories. Frequent expression of CD34 and HLA-DR is indicative of the stem cell derivation of t(8;21) AML cells. The non-blastic leukemic cells in t(8;21) AML tend to lose the immature phenotype with discordant maturation such as low CD33 expression. Further, the blasts show frequent expression of the B-cell antigen, CD19, without other B-cell antigens and immunoglobulin gene rearrangements. AML cells with t(8;21) showed poorer response to granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) due to a decreased number of GM-CSF binding sites. The absence of monocytic differentiation in t(8;21) AML cells might represent the abnormal response to growth factors at the bifurcation stage of granulocyte and monocyte differentiation. Recently, breakpoint region genes for the 8;21 translocation in chromosome 8 and 21 have been isolated, 48-50 and have been named AML1 and ETO, respectively. The AML1 gene showed a strong homology with the Drosophila segmentation gene, runt, which is thought to be necessary for the Sex lethal gene expression. Since the GM-CSF receptor alpha chain gene locates in the pseudoautosomal region of the sex chromosome, the decrease of GM-CSF binding sites might be related to the AML1/ETO fusion gene expression. Further molecular genetic investigations of the breakpoint genes in the future are expected to clarify the unique biological events seen in this type of leukemia.","['AML1', 'ETO']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, defect in cell-mediated immunity appears to be a predisposing factor to infections in patients treated with newer purine analogues. Controversies surrounding the pathogenesis of infectious complications in CLL raise several questions on their management. Patients with advanced disease who receive cytotoxic therapy might qualify for antibacterial prophylaxis. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), although of scientific interest, may be of little relevance at the present time.

However, GC resistance is seen in 10-30% of untreated ALL patients, and is much more frequent in relapsed ALL and in acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia (ANLL). Sensitivity or resistance to GC can be measured using a cell culture drug resistance assay. For this purpose, we use the colorimetric methyl-thiazol-tetrazolium (MTT) assay. We have shown that GC resistance in childhood leukemia is related to clinical and cell biological features, and to the clinical outcome after multi-drug chemotherapy. These results are summarized in this review. In addition, we describe the apoptotic 'cell-lysis pathway' by which GC exert their antileukemic activity. This description provides a model to discuss the mechanisms of GC resistance, and to summarize the relevant literature. Possible levels of resistance relate to the diffusion of GC through the cell membrane, binding to the GC receptor (GCR), activation of the GC-GCR complex, translocation of the complex into the nucleus, binding to DNA, endonuclease-mediated DNA fragmentation, and DNA repair. A low number of GCR has been shown to be the cause of resistance in some children with ALL. However, GC resistance is likely to be caused at the post-receptor level in most leukemias. Unfortunately, there is still a lack of knowledge relating to the clinical relevance of mechanisms of GC resistance at the post-receptor level. Studies on the mechanisms of GC resistance other than those directly related to the GCR should be initiated, especially if patient material is used, as the results might indicate ways to circumvent or modulate GC resistance. A further increase in our knowledge regarding the relation between GC resistance and patient and cell biological features, the clinical relevance of GC resistance, and the mechanisms of GC resistance in leukemia patients, may contribute to further improvement in the results of GC therapy in leukemia.",['c-myc'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Stimulation of RBL cells through the adenosine receptor also induces a very rapid polymerization of actin, which peaks in 45-60 s and is equivalent in magnitude to the F-actin response elicited through stimulation of the IgE receptor. However, in contrast to the IgE mediated response, which remains elevated for over 30 min, the F-actin increase induced by the adenosine analogue 5'-(N-ethylcarboxamido)-adenosine (NECA) is relatively transient and returns to baseline values within 5-10 min. While previous work has shown that the polymerization of actin in RBL cells stimulated through the IgE receptor is mediated by protein kinase C (PKC), protein kinase inhibitors have no effect on the F-actin response activated through the adenosine receptor. In contrast, pretreatment of the cells with pertussis toxin completely inhibits the F-actin response to NECA but has relatively little effect on the response induced through the IgE receptor. Stimulation of RBL cells through either receptor causes increased production of phosphatidylinositol mono-phosphate (PIP) and phosphatidylinositol bis-phosphate (PIP2), which correlates with the F-actin response. Production of PIP and PIP2 may be important downstream signals since these polyphosphoinositides are able to regulate the interaction of gelsolin and profilin with actin. Thus the polymerization of actin can be triggered through either the adenosine receptor or the IgE receptor, but different upstream signaling pathways are being used. The IgE mediated response requires the activation of PKC while stimulation through the adenosine receptor is PKC independent but involves a G protein.",,PMC301039,,,,,,,,,,,,

Inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1 (IL-1) may be critical mediators of this process. If so, specific inhibition of IL-1 activity with recombinant human IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra), a naturally occurring competitive inhibitor of IL-1, may ameliorate acute GVHD. We performed an open-label, phase I/II trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of IL-1Ra in 17 patients with steroid-resistant GVHD. The IL-1Ra was administered as a 24-hour continuous infusion over 7 days. The dose was escalated in cohorts of patients from 400 to 3,200 mg/d. Acute GVHD was evaluated in each affected organ and as an overall grade. Stage-specific improvement of acute GVHD occurred in the skin (8 of 14, 57%), gut (9 of 11, 82%), and liver (2 of 11, 18%). Overall, acute GVHD improved by at least one grade in 10 of 16 (63%) patients. Response to therapy was associated with a reduction of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) mRNA levels in blood mononuclear cells (P = .001). The only toxicity attributable to IL-1Ra was reversible transaminase elevation in two patients. Inhibition of IL-1 activity with IL-1Ra is safe and has demonstrable efficacy in acute GVHD that failed to respond to conventional treatment. These data provide further evidence that IL-1 is a mediator of GVHD.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although effectively preventing GVHD, ex vivo T-lymphocyte marrow depletion unfortunately increases graft rejection and reduces the graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect. The ex vivo transfer of the herpes simplex thymidine kinase (HS-tk) suicide gene into T cells before their infusion with hematopoietic stem cells could allow for selective in vivo depletion of these T cells with ganciclovir (GCV) if subsequent GVHD was to occur. Thus, one could preserve the beneficial effects of the T cells on engraftment and tumor control in patients not experiencing severe GVHD. To obtain T cells specifically depleted by GCV, we transduced primary T cells with a retroviral vector containing the HS-tk and neomycin resistance (NeoR) genes. Gene transfer was performed by coculturing PHA +/- CD3- or alloantigen-stimulated purified T cells on an irradiated retroviral vector producer cell line or by incubating the T cells in supernatant from the producer. Subsequent culture in G418 for 1 week allowed for the selection of transduced cells. GCV treatment of interleukin-2-responding transduced and selected cells resulted in greater than 80% growth inhibition, whereas GCV treatment of control cells had no effect. Similarly, the allogeneic reactivity of HS-tk-transduced cells was specifically inhibited by GCV. Combining transduced and nontransduced T cells did not show a bystander effect, thus implying that all of the cells inhibited by GCV were indeed transduced. Lastly, studies involving the transduction of the HUT-78 (T-lymphoma) cell line suggest that stable expression of HS-tk can be maintained over 3 months in vitro in the absence of G418. In summary, we have established the feasibility of generating HS-tk-transduced T cells for subsequent in vivo transfer with hematopoietic stem cells and, if GVHD occurs, specific in vivo GCV-induced T-cell depletion in allogeneic BMT recipients.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, 73 of the 147 patients were randomized to receive methylprednisolone during the first 35 days after transplant to improve GVHD prevention, whereas 74 patients were randomized not to receive methylprednisolone. The randomized trial enabled us to examine whether methylprednisolone increased the risk of infection after marrow grafting. Charts of study patients were analyzed retrospectively for infection events including bacteremia, septicemia, and fungemia. The randomization was stratified by diagnosis, patient age, genotypic HLA identity, and assignment to laminar airflow room isolation. All patients were given a short course of methotrexate (no longer than 11 days) and cyclosporine for no longer than 180 days after marrow transplantation. Methylprednisolone was begun on the day of marrow grafting at a dose of 1 mg/kg body weight intravenously in divided AM and PM doses through day 22. Methylprednisolone was administered at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg in divided doses from days 22 through 35, and then discontinued. Infections were analyzed for the time interval ending on day 65 after transplantation, which included the period of methylprednisolone administration and 1 month thereafter. Seventy-one episodes of first infection events were observed in patients receiving methylprednisolone compared with 47 episodes in patients not receiving the drug. Predominant infections were bacteremias, followed in descending order by fungemias and septicemias. The most prevalent organisms cultured were gram-positive bacteria, especially coagulase-negative Staphylococcus and Streptococcus species. Pseudomonas species were the most common gram negative bacteria, and the most prevalent fungus was Candida albicans. Multivariable Cox regression analysis showed that patients receiving methylprednisolone had a 1.5 times higher risk of infection (P = .03), with acute GVHD being another independent risk factor for infections (P = .005). Methylprednisolone, when added to GVHD prevention by methotrexate and cyclosporine, increases the risk of infection during the early posttransplantation period.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients had developed acute GVHD at 5 to 26 (median, 14) days after transplantation and had failed to respond to primary therapy with glucocorticoids. Sequential groups of 4 patients each received a single 1-hour infusion of antibody in escalating doses of 0.5, 1.0, or 1.5 mg/kg; 8 additional patients were then treated with 1.5 mg/kg. A second infusion of antibody was administered after 11 to 48 (median, 16) days in 8 patients who had transient improvement of GVHD after the first infusion. Acute side effects, limited to chills in 1 patient and diaphoresis in another, were observed during or shortly after the antibody infusion. Overall improvement of acute GVHD occurred in 8 patients, 6 of whom were treated with a single antibody infusion and 2 with two infusions. Four responses were complete and 4 were partial. Three additional patients had improvement in one organ but progression in another. Responses occurred in 9 of 16 cases with skin disease, 3 of 15 with liver disease, and 6 of 12 with gastrointestinal disease. Two patients survive at 529 and 645 days after antibody treatment. Two patients died after relapse of leukemia. Sixteen patients died of infection or organ failure between 5 and 211 (median, 55) days. The terminal elimination half-life of the antibody was 44 to 363 hours, with a harmonic mean of 79, 88, and 94 hours, respectively, for the three doses studied. Absolute peripheral blood T-lymphocyte counts remained unchanged during the 56 days after infusion of the antibody. A fraction of circulating T cells expressed the alpha chain of the IL-2 receptor that, in some patients, was bound by antibody in vivo up to 28 days after treatment. No patient developed a measurable antibody response to humanized anti-Tac. Humanized anti-Tac has a long half-life after intravenous injection in humans, superior to any rodent monoclonal antibody specific for human T cells, and does not appear to induce antibody formation in recipients of marrow transplants. Improvement of steroid-refractory GVHD in 40% of patients after only one or two antibody infusions indicates that humanized anti-Tac is immunosuppressive.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have purified a 98-kD protein that reproduces this gel shift. Tryptic cleavage and peptide sequence analysis demonstrated that the 98-kD protein is identical to a recently cloned protein, special A-T-rich binding protein 1 (SATB1), that binds selectively to nuclear matrix/scaffold-associated regions of DNA (MARs/SARs). We have shown by functional analysis that the 3' A gamma regulatory element associates with the nuclear matrix. SATB1 mRNA was identified in K562 cells, and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) demonstrated its transcript in several other hematopoietic lines. Antisera to SATB1 caused ablation of the gel shift complex generated by both the crude nuclear extract and the purified 98-kD protein with the site I oligonucleotide. Furthermore, oligonucleotides that bind SATB1 inhibited formation of the site I gel shift complex when added as excess unlabeled competitor. An immunoblot analysis of the site I gel shift complex documented the presence of SATB1. Binding of SATB1 to two sites within the 3' A gamma regulatory element and its MAR/SAR activity suggests that this element may influence gene expression through interaction with the nuclear matrix.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Karyotypes showed that only one AML patient had karyotype 3q26 abnormalities, indicating that EVI1 expression is associated with cases that do not have structural abnormalities involving chromosome 3q26. These studies document for the first time the abnormal expression of EVI1 RNA by patients with MDS, and suggest an important role for EVI1 in the pathogenesis or progression of some myeloid malignancies.",['EVI1'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

This translocation fused the beta T-cell receptor gene (TCRB) constant region and transcriptional enhancer with the type I transcription unit of the LCK gene on the derivative 1 [der(1)] chromosome. The type II promoter was translocated to the der(7) chromosome. Regarding the mechanism of the t(1;7) in HSB-2, we identified an alternating purine-pyrimidine tract (G-T)17 at the 1p34/LCK breakpoint. Additionally, sequence analysis of both breakpoint junctions provided data that implicate the V(D)J recombinase in formation of the t(1;7). A heptamer-nonamer recognition sequence with a 12-bp spacer was found in the immediate vicinity of the 1p34/LCK breakpoint and, thus, chromosomal breakage at 1p34 may be explained as resulting from recombinase activity. Because phosphorylation of Tyr-505 in vivo regulates the tyrosine kinase activity of p56lck we amplified a region from LCK exon 12 that contains the codon for Tyr-505 and showed no mutation of this codon in HSB-2 DNA and, therefore, p56lck in HSB-2 is not activated by mutation of Tyr-505. We have analyzed LCK gene expression in HSB-2 and SUP-T12 cell lines. RNase protection analysis identified almost exclusively type I transcripts in HSB-2. An independent t(1;7) in SUP-T12 also resulted in the juxtaposition of LCK to TCRB. The breakpoint in SUP-T12 occurred 2 kb 5' of the type II promoter, leaving an intact LCK gene on the der(1) chromosome. RNase protection analysis identified both type I and type II LCK transcripts in a 3:1 ratio in SUP-T12. Factors other than proximity to the TCRB enhancer must affect promoter utilization in this cell line.","['LCK', 'TCRB']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients were entered on the multicentre Australian Leukaemia Study Group M4 protocol, and were randomized to receive either standard or high-dose Ara-C together with daunorubicin and etoposide as induction chemotherapy, followed by standard consolidation and maintenance therapy. Diagnostic bone marrow aspirate (152 cases) or peripheral blood samples (16) were analyzed by indirect immunofluorescence and flow cytometry. MoAbs used were directed at myeloid (CD11b, CD13, CD14, CD15, CD33, CD41), lymphoid (CD2, CD3, CD7, CD9, CD10, CD19), or stem cell (HLA-DR, CD34, c-kit receptor) antigens, as well as the leukocyte integrins CD18 and CD49e, and the transferrin receptor CD71. Of the myeloid markers, CD13 and CD33 were the most useful diagnostically (71% and 79% of cases positive, respectively), with CD11b, CD14, and CD15 less commonly positive. A minority of cases expressed lymphoid antigens, either T cell (CD2 16%, CD3 7%, CD7 28%) or B cell (CD10 2%, CD19 7%). CD34 was detected on 42% and c-kit receptor on 48%. When patients were analyzed for response to treatment, CD2, CD9, and CD14 were significantly associated with complete remission rate: cases expressing these antigens had a poorer response than negative cases. In univariate analysis, CD11b+ cases had shorter periods of remission (relative risk of relapse, 2.33; P = .003) and shorter survival (relative death rate, 1.91; P = .006). In multivariate analysis, adjusting for other prognostic factors, CD9 and CD11b were significantly predictive of shorter survival. No other marker had a significant predictive effect. We conclude that myeloid MoAbs are useful in confirming the diagnosis of AML, but their prognostic value may be limited to CD11b. Lymphoid antigen expression is a consistent phenomenon in a minority of cases of AML, but appears to have little clinical significance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The distribution of the heavy-chain classes and subclasses and light-chain types of the serum moIg was similar to those observed in aging (with a higher incidence and no correlation with age in B-CLL) and conditions with defective T-cell functions. Using a specific filter affinity-transfer assay, rheumatoid factors were detected in 58.5% of sera. However, homogeneous anti-IgG antibodies corresponding to a monoclonal IgM of the same light-chain type as the surface IgM were found in 10 patients only.

In addition to previously described risk factors such as age, gender, clinical stage, and treatment modalities, splenectomy was found to correlate with an increase in risk for secondary acute leukemia. We assumed that splenic irradiation inducing functional hyposplenia and splenectomy could have similar consequences on second cancer risk. We studied a series of 892 continuously disease-free HD adult patients treated at a single institution between 1960 and 1984. The risk of second cancer was analyzed (1) relative to the general population and (2) between risk subgroups using the Cox proportional hazards model. Fifty-six patients developed a second cancer (8 acute leukemias, 3 myelodysplastic syndromes, 8 non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, and 37 solid tumors; basal cell and in situ cervix carcinomas were excluded). The 15-year cumulative incidence rate (with 95% confidence limits) was 13.2% (9.3% to 17.2%). Relative to the general population incidence data, the risk of second cancer was multiplied by 4.68 (3.51 to 6.12; P < .001); it was multiplied by 2.80 (1.63 to 4.48; P < .001) in patients whose spleen was not treated and multiplied by 6.87 (4.81 to 9.51; P < .001) in splenectomized patients or patients whose spleen was irradiated. Multivariate regression analysis that controlled for confounding variables (age, gender, clinical stage, extent of radiation therapy, and chemotherapy regimen) showed that, in addition to age above 40 years (relative risk [RR] = 3.72; P < .001), combination of MOPP chemotherapy and regional irradiation (RR = 4.99; P = .015) and combination of MOPP chemotherapy and extended irradiation (RR = 10.86; P < .001), splenic irradiation (RR = 3.67; P = .003), and splenectomy (RR = 2.54; P = .018) also significantly correlated with an increased risk. The results of this hospital-based registry study strongly suggest that splenic irradiation and splenectomy might increase the risk for treatment-related second cancer. These findings, if confirmed, have to be considered in future HD treatment policies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This process requires the participation of many factors, including positive and negative regulators of growth and differentiation, that determine survival, growth stimulation, differentiation, functional activation, and programmed cell death. Understanding the effects of multiple stimuli on specific cells at the molecular and cellular level is crucial towards understanding how the population of blood cells maintains a homeostatic state. Two appropriate stimuli for analysis, both of which are found in bone marrow, are differentiation-inducing cytokines, which induce terminal differentiation associated with growth arrest, ultimately culminating in programmed cell death, and transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1), which induces rapid growth arrest and apoptosis of hematopoietic cells. Previously, we have shown, using M1 myeloblastic leukemic cells as a model system, that differentiation-inducing cytokines induce terminal differentiation associated with growth arrest and, only after 5 to 7 days, apoptosis, whereas TGF-beta 1 induces rapid growth arrest and apoptosis. In this report, we show that M1 myeloid leukemic cells treated concomitantly with the differentiation inducer interleukin-6 and TGF-beta 1 undergo terminal differentiation, in which modulators of the MyD118 gene product, previously shown to be a positive regulator of TGF-beta 1-induced apoptosis, are implicated to play a role in protecting the cells from TGF-beta 1-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, using M1 cell variants blocked at different stages after induction of differentiation, including M1myb and M1myc, as well as conditionally blocked M1mycer, it has been shown that the dominance of interleukin-6 to TGF-beta 1-induced apoptosis is dependent on the progression of the differentiation program. Further studies with M1 and the genetically engineered M1 cell variants will be instrumental towards molecularly dissecting the interaction of hematopoietic differentiation with a variety of apoptotic pathways.","['MyD116', 'MyD118', 'MyD32', 'gadd34', 'gadd45']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

In comparison, phenotypic analysis by immunoperoxidase stains favored a B phenotype in 75 percent of those cases, while flow cytometry assigned 63 percent of cases to a B cell lineage. Gene rearrangements were detected in four of six cases of T-NHL for a rate of 67 percent. The six other lymphoproliferative lesions included Hodgkin's disease, Castleman's disease, and a case of lymphoid hyperplasia. No rearrangements were detected in these specimens.

In the present studies, a series of anthracene- and pyrene-based PAHs were tested for rapid (3 min) and sustained (4 hr) Ca2+ mobilization in the HPB-ALL human T cell line measured by flow cytometry using Fluo-3 as a Ca2+ indicator. Immunosuppressive PAHs produced a sustained Ca2+ elevation for at least 4 hr, while weakly immunosuppressive PAHs caused only a transient increase in Ca2+. The immunosuppressive PAHs, DMBA, benzo[a]pyrene, dibenz[a,h]anthracene, and 9,10-dimethylanthracene, produced a sustained increase in intracellular Ca2+ in HPB-ALL cells. Those PAHs with moderate to minimal immunosuppressive properties (i.e., dibenz[a,c]anthracene, benz[a]anthracene, benzo[e]pyrene, and anthracene) produced small and transient Ca2+ mobilization responses in HPB-ALL cells. It appeared that methylation of anthracene at the 9,10-positions increased the duration of Ca2+ mobilization, whereas the addition of a benzene group in the ""a"" position was associated with a transient increase in Ca2+ levels. Genistein, a protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) inhibitor, partially inhibited the rapid and sustained PAH-induced Ca2+ mobilization responses, while the protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitors, staurosporine and calphostin C, had essentially no effect on PAH-induced Ca2+ elevation. It appears that the action of PAHs on PTKs is important in the rapid Ca2+ response of human T cells. However, additional biochemical mechanisms appear to be responsible for the sustained elevation of Ca2+ produced by PAHs in T cells. The results of these studies demonstrate that persistent elevation of intracellular Ca2+ by PAHs correlates with their known immunosuppressive properties.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A western blot titration assay and an envelope peptide ELISA were used to determine the presence and titre of isotype and IgG subclass responses to the gag p19 and p24 proteins and to the envelope protein. Significant increases were observed in the number of individuals seropositive for a particular isotype and IgG subclass in the HAM/TSP group versus the asymptomatic group particularly for IgM and IgE and to a lesser extent, IgA. The predominant IgG subclasses to the HTLV-I p19, p24 and envelope proteins were IgG1 and IgG3. This finding was also observed in the titres of the antibody responses to these HTLV-I proteins. The HAM/TSP group also exhibited significantly higher neutralizing antibody titres than the asymptomatic group. This evidence suggests that some form of chronic immune stimulation might be involved in the immunopathogenesis of HAM/TSP. In addition, by following the Western blot titre to the IgM and IgE isotypes in particular, it may be possible to identify asymptomatic individuals progressing to HAM/TSP.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Only partial rearrangement of the beta chain associated to an abnormally short transcript was detected in NS8 cells, whereas the gamma chain is rearranged and normally transcribed. On the opposite, rearrangement and expression of these genes were found in the other RadLV-induced lymphomas analysed. Moreover, gamma delta TCR proteins were detected on the cell surface of NS8 cells only, whereas the alpha beta complex, presents on the other T cell lines, was not expressed by NS8 cells. The ability of NS8 cells or of cells obtained from activated lymph nodes (harvested from mice grafted with the T2 sarcoma used to induce the NS8 line) to lyse the T2 sarcoma cell line was analysed. With both types of lymphocytes, the cytotoxicity was partially inhibited by a preincubation of the effector cells with anti-gamma delta antibodies.

DATA SOURCES: Articles, book chapters, and case studies. DATA SYNTHESIS: Despite rigorous topical and systemic antimicrobial therapy, oral opportunistic GNB infections occur following BMT. This is most likely because of low susceptibility of GNB to CHX and not that CHX predisposes patients to these infections or the development of CHX resistant strains. CONCLUSIONS: The benefits of CHX use (e.g. preservation of oral mucosa and broad-spectrum antibacterial and antifungal effects) outweight the risks of GNB infection.

The cause of these deficits is unknown. In a rat model, we determined which agent, or combination of agents, in CNS therapy affected growth. Young Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to cranial irradiation (1000 cGy), methotrexate (2 or 4 mg/kg, intraperitoneally), or prednisolone (18 or 36 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) alone or in two- or three-agent combinations. Matched control groups received appropriate sham radiation, intraperitoneal saline, or both. Body weight was recorded from 14 through 150 d of age. After the rats were killed at 150 d, body length was recorded and the head and left femur were removed to determine body and craniofacial proportions. Cranial irradiation alone, but not methotrexate or prednisolone alone, stunted growth permanently and altered craniofacial proportions. When these agents were combined, methotrexate and prednisolone modified the growth response to cranial irradiation. Methotrexate given before cranial irradiation prevented radiation stunting in males. This protection was lost when the dose of methotrexate was increased, when prednisolone was added to the combination, or when females were studied. The protection in males was effective against both growth and behavioral deficits. These results indicate that the physical and behavioral side effects of CNS therapy are better understood in the context of dose, sex, and interactions of the agents.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To study the structure-function relationships of the rat VL30 dimerization-encapsidation signal (E/DLS), we have performed biochemical and genetic studies of rat VL30 RNA dimerization in vitro. The results show that temperature and specific cation/RNA interactions are important for VL30 dimerization in vitro. VL30 RNA dimerization is optimal at 55 degrees C and Li+ dramatically enhances the stability of VL30 dimeric RNA. In addition, a genetic analysis of VL30 RNA dimerization reveals that a 5' G-rich sequence is critical for dimer formation and that a UGUCUUGUC repeat contributes to VL30 dimer stability. Interestingly enough, substitution of an A for a G in the 5' G-rich sequence is sufficient to abolish VL30 RNA dimerization in vitro. Taken together, these biochemical and genetic data indicate that dimerization of VL30 RNA involves non-canonical base-pairings and possible purine-purine interactions. Nucleocapsid protein NCp10 of murine leukemia virus (MuLV), a gag-encoded protein that is tightly associated with genomic RNA in the virion core, has been shown to have nucleic acid binding and annealing activities. Here we report that the viral NCp10 protein is able to bind tightly to annealing activities. Here we report that the viral NCp10 protein is able to bind tightly to the retrotransposon VL30 RNA and to activate its dimerization. Moreover, mutations in the 5' G-rich sequence of the VL30 dimerization sequence impaired NCp10 binding to RNA. Recombinant MLV-VL30 vectors with mutations in the VL30 dimerization sequence were constructed. Results obtained in vivo clearly show that the mutations that had a deleterious effect on the packaging of MLV-VL30 retroviral vector in vivo were those that impaired VL30 RNA dimerization and interactions with NCp10 in vitro, even the single mutation in the 5' G-rich region. Therefore, these findings suggest that packaging of VL30 RNA into MuLV virions requires specific interactions between RNA dimerization sequences and viral NC protein molecules.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The corresponding half-lives of the derivatives in aqueous solution at pH 7.4 and 37 degrees C ranged from 3.7 to 52 h.

The present study was undertaken to delineate further the role of viral particles and to define the involvement of envelope glycoproteins in the induction of T cell mitogenic stimulation. Virus-producing cells treated with paraformaldehyde (PFA) were found to be unable to induce the formation of syncytia, but still able to trigger the proliferation of resting T cells. Likewise, PFA-treated virus particles were still mitogenic. These results suggest that the mitogenic event is triggered before the fusion of the envelope with the cell membrane. Furthermore, HTLV-I envelope-expressing cells obtained after infection of C8166/45 cells (HTLV-I-transformed, but defective in virion production) with an HTLV-I envelope recombinant vaccinia virus were unable to activate normal T cells. Human immuno-deficiency virus type 1 particles produced by C8166/45 cells were also devoid of mitogenic ability. However, when HTLV-I viral preparations were purified by chromatography, only the virion-containing fractions were found to be mitogenic for human resting T lymphocytes. This mitogenic activity was partially abolished by preincubating the purified virus with a monoclonal antibody directed to the surface envelope glycoprotein. Finally, treatment of HTLV-I-transformed cells by tunicamycin, an inhibitor of N-linked glycosylation, led to the production of virus particles with a decreased mitogenic activity. Collectively, these observations suggest that the HTLV-I mitogenic activity is triggered by the contact of HTLV-I virions with T cells.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The cDNA encoding the human receptor for GaLV SEATO had previously been isolated. We now demonstrate that all of the above GaLVs can use the human form of the GaLV receptor to infect cells. All murine cells analysed to date have been found to be resistant to infection by GaLVs owing to the absence of a functional GaLV receptor. We have now identified a murine cell line which is unique in its susceptibility to GaLV infection. This cell line was established from a Japanese feral mouse, Mus musculus molossinus. We cloned and sequenced the cDNA for the receptor expressed in these cells and compared it to the cDNA for the GaLV receptor expressed in resistant murine cells such as NIH 3T3 (derived from M. m. musculus) and MDTF (derived from M. dunni tail fibroblasts). The crucial region for GaLV infection (the fourth extracellular domain) from the functional M. m. molossinus GaLV receptor is quite divergent from the same region of the M. m. musculus and M. dunni proteins, but similar to that of the functional human GaLV receptor. These results confirm the importance of the amino acids of this region in GaLV receptor function.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CLL occasionally evolves into an aggressive large cell lymphoma termed Richter's syndrome. NZB mice can be used to model the early stage of CLL because aged NZB mice can spontaneously develop slow growing malignant B-1 cell clones. The malignant NZB B-1 clones fail to grow in culture and are typically carried in vivo as passaged lines. During serial passage, an aggressive lymphoma developed as a result of a continued transformation of the original B-1 clone, similar to the development of Richter's syndrome. An in vitro cell line was established from the aggressive lymphoma, which was stromal dependent and could rapidly metastasize when passaged into recipient animals. Analysis of adhesion molecules did not reveal any consistent characteristics that could account for the metastatic potential of the Richter's-like cells. In addition, the aggressive in vitro line had the identical heavy chain sequence as the slow growing NZB malignant B-1 clones. The in vitro and in vivo aggressive B-1 cells had very high levels of IL-10 message, and underwent more apoptosis in response to anti-IgM than did nonaggressive B-1 clones. Taking these characteristics together, we have composed a comprehensive animal model system for human CLL that includes both the aged NZB mice for the early stage and the recipients of the in vitro B-1 line for the late stage or Richter's syndrome. This model system can be used to study, not only the ontogeny and genetic linkage of CLL, but also the regulatory factors involved in transformation and growth both in vivo and in vitro.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A combination of mAb 1C11, which binds to a cell surface glycoprotein on lymphoma cells, and of Abs to the differentiation markers CD4 and CD8 (MHC co-receptors), and CD3 (TCR complex) was used to characterize the phenotypes of preneoplastic thymocytes and to place them within the scheme of normal T cell ontogeny. In the irradiated, preneoplastic thymus, the 1C11 molecule was found to be present on CD4-8-, CD4-8+, and CD4+8+, but not CD4+8-, cells. After intrathymic transfer to Thy-1 congenic recipients, 1C11highCD4-8- cells from irradiated mice showed the highest leukemogenic potential, followed by the 1C11highCD4-8+ and 1C11highCD4+8+ subsets. Within the 1C11highCD4-8- subset, CD3+ cells were more leukemogenic than CD3- cells. The resulting lymphomas were 1C11highCD3+4-8+ and 1C11highCD3+4+8+, phenotypes that are absent or very rare in the normal thymus, but similar to those of primary radiation-induced lymphomas. Examination of the TCR V beta repertoire in these lymphomas shows a highly significant bias, in that approximately 50% express the V beta 8 gene product. These results indicate, but do not prove, that the 1C11highCD3+4-8- cells, a very small subset of normal thymocytes, are either the target of neoplastic transformation after radiation or the earliest identifiable cell population after the transforming event.

With echocardiography ESS/ESVI, the index of the left ventricular contraction, had the highest sensitivity among indices for cardiotoxicity. SF was useful for easy measurement and calculation of cardiotoxicity. Evaluation of the chronic cumulative cardiotoxicity of ATC drugs indicated that cumulative doses of 300 mg/m2 or more resulted in abnormally low ESS/ESVI levels suggesting cardiotoxicity in many cases, and doses of 500 mg/m2 or more caused abnormally low levels in all cases. Evaluation of acute cardiotoxicity showed that post-consolidation therapy ESS/ESVI levels were significantly lower than pre-consolidation therapy levels in the group treated with doses of 500 mg/m2 or more, but the condition was reversible except in those patients with heart failure.

Light-scattering characteristic of AML cells examined by flow cytometry and multiple surface markers were also analyzed using the same samples, to enable a comparison with the French-American-British (FAB) classification. Our AML cases could be classified into three light-scattering classification (LSC) types according to their physical properties on flow cytometry. These were type A, where forward light scattering (FSC) of the leukemic cell population was larger than that of lymphocytes, while side light scattering (SSC) was the same or larger than that of lymphocytes but smaller than that of monocytes; type B, where FSC of the leukemic cell population was larger than that of lymphocytes and SSC spread toward that of monocytes; and type C, where both FSC and SSC of the leukemic cell population spread beyond those of monocytes. Although a clear relationship between the FAB classification and LSC classification by the light-scattering profile of AML was not established, we observed the following findings. The majority of cases were classified as type A (58%), while type B comprised 25% and type C comprised 17%. While CD7 expression on AML cells is considered to be an immature characteristic, CD7 was expressed more frequently among LSC type A cases. Furthermore, all but one of the FAB M1 cases were classified as type A. On the other hand, CD7 was not expressed on type C leukemic cells. The percentage of cases in which more than 60% of leukemic cells possessed another immature surface antigen, CD 34o, was 13/18 (72%) among FAB M1 cases, much higher than among FAB M2 (35%) or FAB M4 (27%) cases. A negative correlation was observed between mature antigen CD33 and CD34 among the FAB M2 cases. The frequency of CD7 expression was 25% among the total cases, and CD7-positive cases were frequent among FAB M1 and M2, but not among FAB M3 cases. These findings concerning LSC and immunophenotyping indicate that the scattergram pattern analysis may contribute towards more precise immunophenotyping, in that it reflects the maturation stage of each AML case.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In mice infected with RLV, DC failed to migrate into lymph nodes following exposure of the skin to the contact sensitizer, fluorescein isothiocyanate. RLV infection of a proportion of DC both in skin and lymph nodes, shown by semi-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and down-regulation of expression of adhesion molecules (CD54 and CD44) on the surface of Langerhans' cells, may contribute to the described phenomenon. A failure of DC migration could be an important immunosuppressive mechanism of RLV infection in mice and we speculate on a similar role for DC in human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) infection in humans.",,PMC1414836,,,,,,,,,,,,

Current studies in CTCL have evaluated serum antibodies to retroviral proteins, electron microscopy to identify viruslike particles, and Southern blot analysis and PCR amplification to detect proviral DNA sequences. There have been inconsistent findings within and between a variety of studies, emphasizing the need for critical evaluation of experimental methods and their potential shortcomings. Several interesting observations have included (1) serologic evidence of HTLV-I infection in a small subset of CTCL patients, (2) cloning of a deleted HTLV-I proviral genome from a B-cell line established from the peripheral blood of a CTCL patient, (3) detection of retrovirus in Langerhans cells and B cells, and (4) molecular evidence for the presence of an HTLV-I-like retrovirus. By viewing CTCL as a model of tumor progression, mechanisms by which retroviruses play a role in the development and progression of CTCL are facilitated. Future studies will need to correlate the detection of proviral sequences and the nature of a retroviral infection with specific cell types and stage of disease and determine if these findings demonstrate a causal role in CTCL or a secondary phenomenon due to CTCL-associated immunosuppression. It is likely that new data will be reported between the writing of this article and the time of publication; however, the currently available data reviewed in this article do not provide conclusive evidence that retroviruses play a primary etiologic role in CTCL.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent studies suggest that this gene may play an important role in a new form of cell resistance to certain chemotherapeutic agents. To examine mechanisms regulating transcriptional activity of this gene, a 2.2-kilobase 5'-flanking sequence of MRP has been isolated from a genomic library prepared from HL60/ADR cells. The 2.2-kilobase DNA fragment linked to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene in a reporter plasmid was found to be capable of driving expression of this gene in transient transfection experiments. This DNA containing promoter activity has been sequenced in its entirety and found to contain multiple putative regulatory sites. A series of deletion mutants linked to the CAT reporter gene was used to examine functional domains of the 2.2-kilobase sequence. The results suggest that promoter activity is contained in nucleotides -91 to +103 in a GC-rich region of the MRP genome. Promoter activity contained within this sequence, however, is modulated by both positive and negative regulatory elements. Certain of the regulatory sites contain consensus sequences for positive and negative regulatory elements which have been found in the promoter regions of other genes. Primer extension analysis indicates the presence of multiple major transcriptional start sites from the MRP promoter. Sequence analysis of MRP genomic and complementary DNAs has defined the exon/intron boundaries and the organization of a portion of the 5'-end region of the MRP genome. The results of these studies thus provide new insight in site-specific domains which may function in the regulation of MRP gene expression.",['MRP'],,,,,['GENBANK/U07050'],,,,,,,,

Incubation of the transfected cells with okadaic acid, an inhibitor of serine phosphatases 2A and 1, induced hyperphosphorylation of p53 protein. The treatment also increased the steady state level of p53 protein in the cells. However, the hyperphosphorylated p53 protein was less active in promoting transcription mediated by two p53-binding DNA elements, the ribosomal gene cluster and the p53 consensus DNA-binding sequence. Nevertheless, the decreased transcription activation was not due to decreased binding of p53 to these elements, as analyzed by mobility shift DNA-binding assays. In addition, the treatment did not induce a conformational change in p53, as assayed by two conformation-specific anti-p53 monoclonal antibodies, PAb240 and PAb1620.

The human IL-2R alpha-expressing cell line was produced by transfecting the gene encoding human Tac into the murine plasmacytoma cell line SP2/0. The resulting cell line, SP2/Tac, expressed approximately 18,000 human IL-2R alpha molecules/cell. Following s.c. or i.p. injection of 2 x 10(6) SP2/Tac cells into nude mice, rapidly growing tumors developed in all animals after a mean of 10 and 13 days, respectively.

In the second model, i.v. treatment with 212Bi-anti-Tac 3 days following s.c. tumor inoculation also resulted in a prolongation of the period before tumor development. However, prevention of tumor occurrence decreased to 30% (95% confidence interval, 11-60%). In both the i.p. and s.c. tumor trials, 212Bi-anti-Tac was significantly more effective for i.p.

The detection of DNA replicating cells is based on incorporation of 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine or 5-iodo-2'-deoxyuridine, followed by selective photolysis at the site of incorporation of the halogenated DNA precursors. Single-strand breaks in DNA resulting from the photolysis are subsequently labeled with digoxygenin or biotin-conjugated dUTP in a reaction catalyzed by exogenous terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase. The double-stranded DNA breaks in apoptotic cells resulting from activation of the endonuclease can be labeled in this reaction as well. However, in contrast to the photolysed DNA, the low molecular weight fraction of DNA of apoptotic cells is extractable from the cells, and the degree of DNA elution can be modulated by cross-linking with formaldehyde. Thus, apoptotic cells can be distinguished and quantified by virtue of their fractional DNA content. Replication of less than 1% of a genome of a cell in the presence of 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (equivalent of a 5-min 10 microM 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine pulse) can be detected by the selective photolysis method. The method was applied to study apoptosis and proliferation of human leukemic HL-60 cells and normal, mitogen-stimulated lymphocytes. Whereas apoptosis of HL-60 cells induced by the DNA topoisomerase I inhibitor camptothecin was selective to DNA replicating cells, apoptosis induced by hyperthermia showed no such selectivity. Lymphocytes that preferentially underwent apoptosis in cultures stimulated by phytohemagglutinin did not initiate DNA replication. By offering the possibility for identification of both DNA replicating and apoptotic cells in a single measurement, the method may find an application in studies of the prognostic value of both cell proliferation and death in human tumors and the apoptotic response of DNA replicating vs. nonreplicating cells to different treatments.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus, cyclin B1 is synthesized during G2 and abruptly degraded during mitosis. The onset of cyclin E synthesis takes place in mid-G1, its maximal expression is at the time of cell entrance to S, and its degradation occurs during cell progression through S phase. In the present study, multiparameter flow cytometry was used to correlate expression of cyclin B1 or cyclin E with cell cycle position (estimated by cellular DNA content) in normal human proliferating lymphocytes as well as in T-cell MOLT-4 leukemia; promyelocytic HL-60 leukemia; histiocytic U937 lymphoma; MCF-7, T-47D, and Hs 587T breast carcinoma; Colo 320DM colon carcinoma; and the T-24 transitional cell carcinoma cell line. The scheduled expression of both cyclins, namely of cyclin B1 restricted to G2 + M cells and of cyclin E restricted to late G1 and early S cells, was observed only in normal lymphocytes and MOLT-4 cells. The cells of HL-60, U937, T-47D, and Hs 587T lines expressed both cyclins in an unscheduled (""ectopic"") fashion, i.e., unrelated to cell cycle position. Colo 320DM cells showed unscheduled expression of cyclin E (i.e., during G2) but expression of cyclin B1 in this line was generally restricted to G2 + M cells. There were relatively few (10-12%) cells in MCF-7 and T-24 cell lines that expressed cyclin B1 or E in an unscheduled manner. It may be expected that the unscheduled expression of cyclins in tumor cells may lead to a loss of the regulatory mechanisms of cell cycle progression and that such feature of the tumor may be of prognostic value. There is a need, therefore, to conduct similar studies in primary tumor cells.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have previously reported the detection of ALL-1 gene rearrangements in adult patients with acute myeloid leukemia lacking cytogenetic evidence of 11q23 translocations. These included 2 of 19 patients with normal karyotypes as well as 3 of 4 patients with trisomy 11 as a sole cytogenetic abnormality. Rearrangement of the ALL-1 genes in two of the patients with trisomy 11 was shown to result from a direct tandem duplication of a portion of the gene spanning exons 2-6. Here we report the characterization of the ALL-1 gene rearrangement in one of the previously reported acute myeloid leukemia patients with a normal karyotype. ALL-1 rearrangement in this patient results from a direct tandem duplication of a portion of the gene spanning exons 2-8. RNA polymerase chain reaction and DNA sequence analysis show that the partially duplicated ALL-1 gene is transcribed into mRNA capable of encoding a partially duplicated protein. Sequence analysis of the genomic fusion region provides evidence for Alu-mediated homologous recombination as a mechanism for partial duplication of the ALL-1 gene.,['ALL-1'],,,,,['GENBANK/S73203'],,,,,,,,

The cohort consisted of 15,826 male and female employees who were exposed to styrene for at least six months between 1948 and 1977 at 30 participating manufacturing plants in the United States. A total of 1628 deaths were reported during the extended observation period, 1948-89. Mortality from several causes showed significant increases--namely, all causes, all cancers, oesophageal cancer, lung cancer, cancer of the cervix uteri, cancer of other female genital organs, hypertensive heart disease, certain non-malignant respiratory diseases, motor vehicle accidents, and homicides. When, however, mortality data were examined in terms of duration of employment, durations of styrene exposure, and cumulative styrene exposure no upward trend was detected in any of these causes of death. Most of the increases in mortality were among workers who were employed for only six months to a year or who had very low cumulative exposure (< 10 ppm-years). Therefore, the increased mortality was not likely to be related to exposure to styrene. Several explanations for the increased mortality are offered, including low socioeconomic class, smoking, and lifestyle factors characteristic of short term workers. There was no increased mortality from lymphatic and haematopoietic cancers overall or from any specific haematological malignancies. In particular, no increase in mortality from non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease, multiple myeloma, or leukaemia was found. Furthermore, detailed exposure-response analyses did not show any relation between exposure to styrene and any of these haematological malignancies. The lack of an exposure-response relation further supports the conclusion that workers in the reinforced plastics industry in this study did not experience any increased risk of lymphatic and haematopoietic cancers as a result of their exposure to styrene.",,PMC1127994,,,,,,,,,,,,

The outlook for menogaril is less clear, given the modest antitumour activity reported so far. Although the oral formulations of idarubicin and menogaril remain investigational, they represent a step forward in the direction of developing new active anticancer drugs with oral bio-availability.

Recombinant interleukin-2 (IL-2), which is capable of increasing the antileukemic activity of peripheral blood lymphocytes obtained from patients who have undergone BMT, has been proposed as a potentially useful agent to reduce the risk of relapse post-BMT. We have previously shown that IL-2 administered to patients at very low doses after BMT is both clinically tolerable and immunologically active. We now report on the clinical outcome of 29 patients treated with low-dose IL-2 after CD6-depleted allogenic BMT for hematologic malignancy. IL-2 was administered by continuous infusion for up to 3 months beginning at a median of 67 days post-BMT. Eligibility requirements for IL-2 therapy included demonstration of stable engraftment and absence of acute grade 2-4 graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Low-dose IL-2 was well tolerated by the majority of patients, with only 4 of 29 subjects withdrawn early. Acute GVHD developed in only one individual. After 12 weeks of treatment, the mean number of circulating natural killer cells in patients increased 10-fold without any significant change in T-cell number. Of the 25 patients who received > or = 1 month of IL-2, only 6 have relapsed. Relapse rate and disease-free survival (DFS) were determined in the 25 patients who completed at least 4 weeks of IL-2 treatment and compared with historical controls transplanted at our institution for the same conditions and treated with an identical ablative regimen and method of T-cell depletion. Only control patients who had survived disease free for 100 days post-BMT were included in this analysis. Cox's proportional hazards regression model suggested that, compared with control patients without a history of GVHD, patients treated with IL-2 had a lower risk of disease relapse (hazard ratio 0.34; range, 0.14 to 0.82) and superior DFS (hazard ratio 0.39; range 0.18 to 0.87). A randomized controlled trial of IL-2 immunotherapy after T-cell-depleted BMT should now be undertaken.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The cytogenetic changes were first detected 1.8 to 6.5 years (mean, 3.9) after induction chemotherapy, and 0.5 to 3.1 years (mean, 1.4) after transplantation, and were characteristic of those reported for therapy-related myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) in 9 of the patients: abnormalities of chromosome 5 or 7 (classical-form) were present in 4, 11q23 or 21q22 abnormalities (topoisomerase II-related form) were detected in 3, and a combination of both forms was seen in 2 patients. Clonal 2p abnormalities were found in the 1 remaining patient. The abnormal karyotypes were associated with morphologically recognizable MDS in 3 patients and with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) arising in MDS in 2. Four of these patients have died: 3 of AML and 1 of infection. One patient is still alive with cytopenia. The clonal cytogenetic abnormalities were not associated with MDS in 5 patients: 1 has died of recurrent lymphoma, 2 have cytopenia, and 2 still have no morphologic or clinical evidence of MDS after short follow-up (4 and 13 months). Compared with a control group matched for disease, length of follow-up, and treatment with auto-BMT, there were no statistically significant associations between the development of clonal chromosomal abnormalities and age, number of chemotherapeutic regimens, prior local radiation, BMT conditioning regimen (with or without total body irradiation), or type of lymphoma. These studies show that the risk of developing clonal cytogenetic changes after auto-BMT for malignant lymphoma is approximately 9% at 3 years, even when pre-BMT karyotypic studies are normal. The exact significance of these cytogenetic abnormalities in the absence of MDS or AML is unclear.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In hairy cell leukemia (HCL) the malignant cells display a highly characteristic tissue distribution in which interactions with extracellular matrix (ECM) are often prominent. Therefore, we used HCL as a model in which to investigate the poorly understood integrin/ECM interactions that underlie the migratory behavior of malignant B lymphocytes. Using a combined approach involving immunocytochemistry, flow cytometry, and immunoprecipitation analysis, hairy cells (HCs) were shown to have a consistent and distinctive phenotype (mainly alpha 4 beta 1, alpha 5 beta 1, alpha v beta 1, and alpha v beta 3). Furthermore, functional studies utilising adhesion assays, time-lapse video-microscopy and image analysis showed that the HCs displayed very specific adhesive behaviour in response to relevant adhesive protein ligands. HCs were able to adhere to different extents on all the adhesive proteins examined, but, on laminin and collagen, binding was weak with little cytoplasmic spreading. In contrast, the cells showed strong adhesion both to fibronectin (FN) and to vitronectin (VN). On FN, the cells spread extensively with nonpolarized cytoplasmic projections, whereas on VN cytoplasmic projections were markedly polarized. This polarized morphology was shown to reflect cell motility. Investigation of the role of individual integrin receptors in the cell movement response suggested that alpha v beta 3 is the major integrin responsible for this motile behavior. These results are discussed in relation to the limited previous data on leukemic and activated B-cell integrins, and we suggest that the HC integrins play a significant role in the characteristic behavior of HCs within tissues.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The patients with the extraordinary integration patterns had clinical characteristics dissimilar to those of the other 83 patients with the ordinary integration pattern. The patients with two bands by EcoRI digestion always had severe hypoxemia with extremely high levels of serum lactate dehydrogenase at first presentation and showed peculiar organ infiltrations, such as retina and muscle, which were less frequent in the other ordinary 83 patients. They all died within 8 months after the onset. In contrast, the patients with one smaller band by EcoRI digestion always had small and mature T lymphocytes with bilobulated nuclei without lymphadenopathy and showed a favorable clinical course, which was uncommon in the ordinary cases.

On the other hand, emerging evidence also suggests a role for regulation of PKC levels in mediating long term cellular functions. In human leukemia cell line HL-60, the action of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 results in transcriptional up-regulation of PKC beta (within 8-12 h) (L. M. Obeid et al., J. Biol. Chem., 265: 2370-2374, 1990). In this study, the role of PKC beta in the regulation of proliferation and differentiation was studied. 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 caused an increase in PKC beta I, beta II, and, to a lesser extent, PKC alpha, as determined by Western blot analysis. This increase was accompanied by inhibition of proliferation and induction of differentiation. The addition of a 25-base pair antisense oligonucleotide directed against the 5' coding sequence of PKC beta attenuated up-regulation of PKC beta I and beta II levels in response to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. This antisense oligonucleotide, but not sense oligonucleotide or antisense oligonucleotide to PKC alpha, caused inhibition of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3-induced differentiation by 25-45%. On the other hand, inhibition of cell proliferation by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 was minimally affected by the addition of antisense oligonucleotides. These results identify a role for PKC beta in cell differentiation and underscore the significance of transcriptional activation of PKC as a mechanism for long-term regulation of PKC. The results also distinguish signaling pathways involved in cell differentiation from those involved in antiproliferation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All patients developing avascular necrosis of bone after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation between January 1974 and September 1992 were included in the analysis and were studied using the Hopital Saint Louis Bone Marrow Transplant Database and hospital records. 27/727 allogeneic transplant recipients developed avascular necrosis leading to an 8.1% incidence at 5 years, by product limit estimate, ranging from 5% to 11.2%. Symptoms developed 119-1747 d (median 398 d) after transplantation. In these 27 patients a total of 52 joints were affected (mean 1.92 per patient, range 1-7). The hip joint was most often affected (69% of patients). All patients had joint pain that led to diagnosis by means of standard radiographs with or without the help of technetium-99 scans and/or magnetic resonance imaging. All but three patients received steroid therapy for acute graft-versus-host disease. Among 10 factors tested, three were shown to be significantly linked to an increased risk for developing avascular necrosis by multivariate analysis: male gender (relative risk (RR) 4.72, P = 0.002), age older than 16 (RR = 3.87, P = 0.004), and acute graft-versus-host disease requiring steroid therapy (RR = 6.30, P = 0.0002). 10 patients (37%) required joint replacement within 19 months (range 2-42) following diagnosis of avascular necrosis. In conclusion, avascular necrosis of bone is a frequent late complication of allogeneic bone marrow transplantation causing significant morbidity and requiring replacement surgery in one-third of affected patients.

Resistance to the antitumour drugs could be reduced to various extents by CSA. The patterns of changes and modulations of DAU transport kinetics, as well as chemosensitivity in K562 c1.6/DAU cells were found to be similar to a vinblastine-resistant leukaemia cell line CEM/VLB100. However, K562 c1.6/DAU cells were more resistant to DAU, doxorubicin and etoposide than the CEM/VLB100 cells. An increase in DAU accumulation, intracellular SL and the time to reach 90% saturation level (SL90), and a decrease in DAU efflux in the resistant but not the sensitive cells were found in response to ATP depletion by sodium azide. These effects could be completely reversed by addition of glucose. Our results suggest that the presence of an energy-dependent effluxing mechanism responsible for the decreased drug accumulation and enhanced drug efflux may make a major contribution to the mechanism of resistance in K562 c1.6/DAU resistant cells.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, another potential mechanism of autonomous growth involves the deletion of growth inhibitory molecules. One such inhibitory protein is the product of the retinoblastoma (Rb) gene which is expressed in normal haemopoietic cells and functions in cell cycle control and as a transcriptional repressor. Deletion of the Rb gene has been reported in various types of malignancy. We have examined the expression of the Rb gene product in blasts from 39 patients with AML by Western analysis. Using an antibody, Rb (Ab-2) which recognizes the C-terminal region, 11/39 samples (28%) failed to express Rb protein. The results of the Western blot analysis were confirmed by flow cytometry using a second antibody, Rb (Ab-1), against residues 300-380 of the Rb protein. Samples from seven of the 11 Rb-negative cases were studied for the expression of Rb mRNA; Rb mRNA was absent in four and three cases were positive. Analysis of the growth characteristics of these cells showed that blasts from 24/39 cases (62%) had partially or totally autonomous growth in a blast cell colony assay. Of these 24 samples with autonomous growth, 10 (41%) were Rb protein negative; in contrast, of the 15 cases with non-autocrine growth only one was Rb protein negative (7%, P < 0.05). Also, in Rb positive blasts, suppression of Rb protein production using an antisense oligonucleotide significantly increased proliferation of clonogenic AML blasts, confirming that the Rb protein acts as a negative regulator of growth in AML blasts. Our data suggest that deletion of Rb protein expression is frequently found in AML and is associated with the acquisition of autocrine growth characteristics, possibly as the consequence of derepression of genes involved in growth control and cytokine production.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tumour necrosis factor (TNF) is a growth factor for these malignant cells, although the proliferative response is usually small. TNF regulates some of its cellular responses via induction of the transcription factors NF kappa B and AP-1 (jun/fos). The induction of NF kappa B by TNF is mediated via a novel signalling pathway involving the generation of reactive oxidative intermediates. Induction of jun and fos proteins (polypeptide components of AP-1) are mediated via pathways involving protein kinase C and the protein kinase encoded by the raf proto-oncogene. Here we have used an electrophoretic mobility shift assay to show that TNF induced NF kappa B in malignant cells isolated from 3/3 HCL and 15/15 B-CLL patients. By contrast, phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), a direct activator of protein kinase C, failed to activate this transcription factor in 1/1 HCL and 5/5 B-CLL isolates. The induction of jun and fos proteins (as detected by Western blot analysis) showed greater heterogeneity. Nuclear jun was induced by TNF in 5/12 chronic B cell leukaemia isolates. PMA induced this protein in 4/5 samples. Nuclear fos was induced by TNF in only 2/12 isolates and by PMA in 2/5. The data suggest that the pathways for the activation of jun and fos by TNF are defective in some B-CLL and HCL cells and that these defects may be heterogeneous. The induction of AP-1 is crucial in securing the mitogenic response to TNF. It is therefore plausible that these lesions may contribute to the refractory nature of B-CLL and HCL cells to proliferative stimuli in vitro.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A consensus Nef sequence was derived and used to identify several features that were highly conserved among the Nef sequences. These features included a nearly invariant myristylation signal, regions of sequence polymorphism and variable duplication, a region with an acidic charge, a (Pxx)4 repeat sequence, and a potential protein kinase C phosphorylation site. Clustering of premature stop codons at position 124 was noted in 6 of the 54 Nef sequences. Further analysis revealed four stretches of residues that were highly conserved not only among the patient-derived HIV-1 Nef sequences, but also among the Nef sequences of HIV-2 and the SIVs, suggesting that Nef proteins expressed by these retroviruses are functionally equivalent. The ""Nef-defining"" sequences were used to evaluate the sequence alignments of known proteins reported to share sequence similarity with Nef sequences and to conduct additional computer-based searches for similar protein sequences.

Both patients demonstrated clinical and laboratory findings of disseminated intravascular coagulation, massive cell lysis manifested by marked increases in serum lactic dehydrogenase, and rapid clinical deterioration. Both patients developed bone marrow necrosis within viable, noninfarcted bone trabeculae. We postulate that the development of bone marrow necrosis in these two patients was not a chance occurrence. Rather, the specific combination of cytotoxic and differentiating agents used in these patients (hydroxyurea with all-trans retinoic acid) caused massive cell lysis and death. The absence of bone marrow necrosis in the setting of induction therapy for APL both with and without all-trans retinoic acid therapy suggests that the addition of hydroxyurea was critical to the development of marrow necrosis.

Gel filtration chromatography indicated that the molecular weight of DCDF is approximately 30-35 kDa. Chromatofocusing indicated that the isoelectric point of DCDF is approximately 5.0. DCDF, partially purified by subsequent gel filtration, chromatofocusing, and hydrophobic chromatography, significantly enhanced the HLA-DR expression of normal human monocytes and a human monocytic leukemia cell line, THP-1. This biological activity was not neutralized by any known antibodies to human cytokines. DCDF significantly amplified the T-cell stimulatory activity of monocytes in the allogeneic mixed leukocyte reaction (MLR).

All seropositive cattle were tested for BLV antigen expression in lymphocyte cultures, and 51% found to express detectable quantities of viral antigens. In the four herds with 19% to 21% infection prevalence, all antigen-positive animals were culled immediately. Antigen-negative animals were retained in the herds for at least 16 months. Only two new infections were recorded in these four herds after antigen-positive animals had been culled, despite the continued presence of the antigen-negative animals. In the herd with 39% infection prevalence, a rapid reduction in the incidence of infection was achieved, even though only those animals with the highest levels of antigen expression were culled initially. Experimental transmissions from seropositive cattle indicated that sheep could be infected from an antigen-positive cow with fewer than 10(3) lymphocytes, whereas more than 10(6) lymphocytes were required to transmit infection from an antigen-negative cow. Estimation of the amount of integrated BLV DNA in serial dilutions of blood from antigen-positive and antigen-negative cattle provided an explanation for the higher infectivity of antigen-positive cattle.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The absence of any positive PCR results in animals from BLV free herds confirmed the specificity of the assay. Initial testing of the infected herd using a single amplification PCR (SA-PCR), detected BLV infection in 62 of 72 adult animals that were seropositive by the agar gel immunodiffusion (AGID) test and in one persistently seronegative cow. Infection in this cow was confirmed by sheep bioassay. Subsequent testing of the SA-PCR negative, seropositive animals using a double amplification PCR (DA-PCR) detected proviral BLV in eight of nine animals that were available for retesting. The PCR assay was also able to distinguish BLV infected calves from uninfected calves that were serologically positive because of the presence of colostral antibody. Lymphocytes from all seropositive animals were cultured for determination of BLV antigen expression. Cultures from 37 of 62 SA-PCR positive animals produced detectable quantities of viral antigens. However, antigen expression was not detected in cultures from seropositive animals that were negative in the SA-PCR.

Autopsy records of 373 breeders and normal controls showed very low incidence of spontaneous malignant tumors in cynomolgus (1.5%) and rhesus (2.8%) monkeys, but considerably higher incidence in African green monkeys (8%). A large number of substances including a variety of food additives, food components, environmental contaminants, N-nitroso compounds, ""classical"" rodent carcinogens, antineoplastic agents, and immunosuppressive agents have been evaluated for long-term carcinogenic activity. Food components tested which are probably most relevant to human exposure are the artificial sweeteners, cyclamate and saccharin. After 22 years of continuous dosing, neither cyclamate nor saccharin have shown any evidence of carcinogenic effects. Similarly, the tumorigenic potential of arsenic and DDT was negligible after dosing for 15-22 years. In contrast, the fungal food contaminants, aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) and sterigmatocystin (SMT), were found to be potent hepatocarcinogens. AFB1 also induced adenocarcinomas of the pancreas, osteosarcomas, and other tumors. Also, the aglycone of cycasin, MAM acetate, induced a variety of tumors, but primarily hepatocellular and renal cell carcinomas. The compounds most recently introduced into the colony include three heterocyclic amines present in cooked meat. One of these compounds, 2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (IQ) has proven to be one of the most potent hepatocarcinogens in the history of the monkey project, inducing malignant liver tumors in 65% of animals over a 7-year period of exposure. Of the classical rodent carcinogens studied, urethane was the only one which produced malignant tumors in the monkeys. Conversely, all except two of the N-nitroso compounds were carcinogenic. Diethylnitrosamine (DENA) was the most potent and predictable hepatocarcinogen in cynomolgus, rhesus, and African green monkeys. However, when administered intraperitoneally to galagos (a prosimian), DENA induced primarily mucoepidermoid carcinoma of the nasal cavity. N-Methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU) was the only carcinogen persistently producing tumors in the digestive tract, mostly squamous cell carcinomas of the esophagus. Among the antineoplastic and immunosuppressive agents, procarbazine (MIH) was the only unequivocal carcinogen, with a 33% tumor incidence, causing acute nonlymphocytic leukemia in most of the cases.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There is also evidence that its plays a role in the response of adult neural tissue to injury. We have examined this possibility further in rats by analyzing changes in the levels of mRNAs for CDF/LIF and its two receptor subunits in response to peripheral nerve damage in culture and in vivo. Using a quantitative RNase protection assay, we find that CDF/LIF mRNA increases dramatically (176-fold) in adult, but not neonatal, sympathetic ganglia and in adult dorsal root ganglia and sciatic nerve after organ culture for 24 hr. This mRNA is clearly detectable by in situ hybridization only in the nonneuronal cells of these structures. When the sciatic nerve is transected in vivo, CDF/LIF mRNA increases significantly in the regions immediately proximal and distal to the lesion site. The mRNA for the ligand binding subunit of the CDF/LIF receptor complex decreases somewhat upon culture and nerve section. The dramatic rise in CDF/LIF mRNA after nerve injury is further evidence that this cytokine is involved in the response to damage, a function that overlaps with its postulated role in wounding or infection in several nonneural tissues.",,PMC44348,,,,,,,,,,,,

By expression in Xenopus laevis oocytes and in mammalian cells, we have identified Glvr-1 and Ram-1 as sodium-dependent phosphate symporters. Two-electrode voltage-clamp analysis indicates net cation influx, suggesting that phosphate is transported with excess sodium ions. Phosphate uptake was reduced by > 50% in mouse fibroblasts expressing amphotropic envelope glycoprotein, which binds to Ram-1, indicating that Ram-1 is a major phosphate transporter in these cells. RNA analysis shows wide but distinct tissue distributions, with Glvr-1 expression being highest in bone marrow and Ram-1 in heart. Overexpression of Ram-1 severely repressed Glvr-1 synthesis in fibroblasts, suggesting that transporter expression may be controlled by net phosphate accumulation. Accordingly, depletion of extracellular phosphate increased Ram-1 and Glvr-1 expression 3- to 5-fold. These results suggest simple methods to modulate retroviral receptor expression, with possible applications to human gene therapy.",,PMC44340,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although several additional enzymatic steps are involved in this type of analysis, the reliability of the entire procedure is determined by the initial ligation step, which marks and preserves the termini of cellular RNA molecules. We applied this approach to the analysis of the 5' terminus of beta globin mRNA in various murine erythroid cells. As expected, we detected RNA molecules with 5' ends terminating at the regular cap site as well as globin RNA molecules truncated at the 5' end. Unexpectedly, we also detected a class of beta globin mRNA which is identical to regular beta globin mRNA in every respect but contains 17, 29, or 31 additional nucleotides 5' to the regular cap site. These extensions correspond precisely to the genomic segments just upstream of the regular cap site and are probably generated by initiation of transcription of the globin gene upstream from the regular cap site. It is likely that the extended globin RNA is transcribed not from the TATA promoter, which regulates the transcription of regular murine globin mRNA, but from the GATA regulatory element located 30 nucleotides upstream of the 31-nucleotide extension, in a position identical to that of the active GATA promoter of the TATA-less chicken beta globin gene. The evolutionary conservation of this relationship suggests the importance of the GATA promoter element of the mouse beta globin gene and its possible involvement in developmental regulation of expression of this gene.",,PMC308202,,,,"['GENBANK/S71555', 'GENBANK/S71558', 'GENBANK/S71559']",,,,,,,,

Several new concepts and pioneering approaches surfaced during the workshop discussions, as summarized above. The design and implementation of translational clinical trials that emphasize these innovative strategies were encouraged as a way to test the concepts put forward at the workshop. Representatives of the Leukemia Society of America and the National Cancer Institute plan to continue their dialogue to develop recommendations regarding the priorities for linked clinical-laboratory investigations on the hematopoietic malignancies and the optimal ways in which to foster such translational research. To this end, the explosion in basic science discoveries during the last two decades and especially during the last 5 years is producing a critical mass of knowledge. This knowledge, in turn, allows us to view leukemia from new perspectives that span molecular pathogenesis, epidemiology, early detection of minimal disease, and the selective targeting of critical leukemogenic mechanisms for therapeutic and ultimately preventive purposes. As in previous decades, during which leukemia has served as the testing ground for precedent-setting concepts of curative therapy (dose-intensity, non-cross-resistance-inducing combinations and aggressive therapy in the minimal residual disease state), leukemia should again serve as a clinical beacon for the identification and exploitation of new molecular targets for therapy. Any impact on curability and duration and quality of survival will be achieved only by building on the cumulative knowledge accrued at multiple levels--molecular and cellular levels as well as in the intact patient--and augmenting the momentum of the bidirectional exchange of information between the laboratory and the clinic that has characterized leukemia research from its incipience. The challenge is formidable and worthy of our most creative and concerted efforts.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The literature was analyzed using MEDLINE (National Library of Medicine, Bethesda, MD) and reports were identified through review of report bibliographies. Pertinent studies were selected and data synthesized into a review format. RESULTS: Leukemic relapse after allogeneic BMT is an important cause of treatment failure. The risk of leukemic relapse varies from 20% to 60% depending on the diagnosis and phase of disease. Reinduction chemotherapy (CT), second BMT, interferon (IFN) alfa, and donor leukocyte infusions are various options, but none of the approaches is clearly optimal. Approximately 50% of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients achieve remission after standard induction CT. However, most patients finally relapse and die of uncontrolled leukemia. Second BMT is successful in 20% to 25% patients and is a reasonable option in patients who relapse more than 6 months after the initial transplant. Young patients with a good performance status and those in remission from initial transplant relapse have a better outcome after second BMT. Venocclusive disease (VOD), interstitial pneumonitis (IP), and acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) are the main complications. Therapy with IFN alfa results in cytogenetic complete remission (CR) in 10% to 25% patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). The initial results of leukocyte infusions from the original donor are promising. However, acute GVHD and bone marrow aplasia are associated complications. The correct dose and schedule of donor leukocyte infusions need to be determined in future studies to minimize GVHD while maintaining the graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect. CONCLUSION: Identification of patients at increased risk for relapse and use of biologic response modifiers post-transplant to augment the GVL effect in such patients are possible areas of improvement for future studies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We report four oncology patients who developed TAD and review the 22 reports that have previously been published of individuals in whom TAD appeared either before, concomitant with, or after the diagnosis of their malignancy. RESULTS: TAD was associated more frequently in patients with hematologic malignancies, especially acute and chronic myelogenous leukemia. It also appeared in patients with solid tumors, primarily those of the genitourinary organs. In almost all the cases, the onset of TAD was either concurrent or followed the discovery of malignancy. The TAD resolved completely, with or without treatment, in at least 20 patients in a median of 3 weeks. CONCLUSION: TAD is a benign and temporary condition that may occur in patients with an internal malignancy. When the diagnosis of TAD is being considered, a lesional skin biopsy readily establishes histologic confirmation in a febrile patient with cancer who develops a new rash. TAD has been observed most frequently in oncology patients who have either myelogenous leukemia or carcinoma of the genitourinary organs. The appearance of TAD coincided with either the detection or the recurrence of malignancy in three individuals (12%). In the other 23 oncology patients, TAD was most likely secondary to either antineoplastic agents, excessive perspiration, fever, occlusive immobility, and/or ionizing or UV radiation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our purpose was to identify factors associated with high-risk MTX plasma concentrations (defined by plasma concentration > or = 1.0 mumol/L at 42 hours from the start of MTX) and with toxicity. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Variables associated with MTX concentrations and toxicity were assessed in 134 children treated with one to five courses of HD-MTX (900 to 3,700 mg/m2 intravenously [i.v.] over 24 hours for a total of 481 courses) for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). RESULTS: High-risk MTX concentrations, toxicity (usually mild mucositis), and delay in resuming continuation chemotherapy occurred in 106 (22%), 123 (26%), and 66 (14%) of 481 courses, respectively. Using a mixed effects model for repeated measures, high-risk MTX concentrations were significantly associated with a higher MTX area-under-the-concentration-time curve (AUC), low urine pH, emesis, low MTX clearance, low urine output relative to intake, use of antiemetics during the MTX infusion, and concurrent intrathecal therapy (all p values < .01). Clinical toxicities and delay in resumption of continuation chemotherapy due to myelosuppression were more common in those with high 42-hour MTX concentrations, despite increased leucovorin rescue for all patients with high-risk MTX concentrations. However, with individualized rescue, no patient developed life-threatening toxicity. A more aggressive hydration and alkalinization regimen for subsequent courses reduced the frequency of high-risk MTX concentrations to 7% of courses (13 of 183) (P = .0001), and the frequency of toxicity decreased to 11% of courses (P = .0074). CONCLUSION: This study identified several clinical variables that influence MTX disposition that, when modified, can reduce the frequency of high-risk MTX concentrations and toxicity.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To investigate this phenomenon, we studied the IGF-I responsiveness of human marrow cells expressing IGF-I receptor (IGF-IR), a direct strategy not used previously. IGF-IR+ and control CD34+ marrow cells were isolated using immunoaffinity methods. Then, the cells were cloned in methylcellulose containing variable amounts of serum- and lineage-appropriate growth factors supplemented with recombinant human IGF-I. In contrast to CD34+ cells, IGF-IR+ cells never gave rise to CFU-Blast, CFU-Mix, CFU-GM, BFU-E, or CFU-E. To substantiate the suggestion that CD34+ and IGF-IR+ cells were distinct populations, we used reverse transcription PCR to detect IGF-I, EpO, and KIT receptor mRNAs in these cells. The mRNA phenotype of CD34+ cells was EpO (+), KIT (+), and IGF-IR (-), while IGF-IR+ cells were IGF-IR (+), EpO (-), and KIT (-). These results suggested that IGF-IR is either not expressed or expressed at low levels on normal hematopoietic progenitor cells. Functional significance of the latter possibility was tested by exposing CD34+ cells to IGF-IR antisense oligodeoxynucleotides. Colony formation was unaffected by oligodeoxynucleotide disruption of IGF-IR, suggesting that, even if expressed at low level, the receptor's functional significance was doubtful. Nevertheless, when cultured in the presence of IGF-I, IGF-IR+ cells elaborated an activity with mild BFU-E stimulatory effects. Accordingly, if IGF-I plays a role in hematopoietic colony formation, it is probably and results from stimulation of IGF-IR-positive ancillary cells to secrete growth factors. Studies carried out with human leukemia cells yielded similar results.",,PMC296312,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because arachidonic acid contributes to radiation-induced tumor necrosis factor expression, we analyzed the effects of agents which alter arachidonate metabolism on the regulation of this gene. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Phospholipase A2 inhibitors quinicrine, bromphenyl bromide, and pentoxyfylline or the inhibitor of lipoxygenase (ketoconazole) or the inhibitor of cyclooxygenase (indomethacin) were added to cell culture 1 h prior to irradiation. RESULTS: Radiation-induced tumor necrosis factor gene expression was attenuated by each of the phospholipase A2 inhibitors (quinicrine, bromphenyl bromide, and pentoxyfylline). Furthermore, ketoconazole attenuated X ray induced tumor necrosis factor gene expression. Conversely, indomethacin enhanced tumor necrosis factor expression following irradiation. CONCLUSION: The finding that radiation-induced tumor necrosis factor gene expression was attenuated by ketoconazole suggests that the lipoxygenase pathway participates in signal transduction preceding tumor necrosis factor induction. Enhancement of tumor necrosis factor expression by indomethacin following irradiation suggests that prostaglandins produced by cyclooxygenase act as negative regulators of tumor necrosis factor expression. Inhibitors of tumor necrosis factor induction ameliorate acute and subacute sequelae of radiotherapy. We propose therefore, that ketoconazole may reduce acute radiation sequelae such as mucositis and esophagitis through a reduction in tumor necrosis factor induction or inhibition of phospholipase A2 in addition to its antifungal activity.","['Egr-1', 'TNF', 'c-jun']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, in addition to the widely used E. Coli-derived L-ase, a new L-ase derived from Erwinia Carotovora has been introduced into clinical studies. This formulation seems to have lesser side-effects, but data on its effects on the hemostatic system are very limited. We report here the hemostatic changes observed in 10 adult patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) treated with Erwinia- or with E. Coli-derived L-ase. METHODS AND RESULTS: The decreases (percentages of basal level) of antithrombin III, protein C and plasminogen (functional assays) were similar in both groups of patients (about 50% of the basal value 6 or 8 days after starting L-ase) and so were the number of instances in which the level of these proteins fell below 70% of normal. On the contrary, the fibrinogen level (PT-derived method) was less severely decreased by Erwinia L-ase (34% of basal value for E. Coli L-ase versus 58% for Erwinia L-ase; P = 0.048) and there were more instances in which the fibrinogen level was less than 100 mg/dL than with E. Coli L-ase (40% versus 16%; P = 0.051). Thrombin-AT-III complexes (ELISA) showed similar pattern during both treatments. Two patients treated with Erwinia L-ase had moderate hyperglycemia, requiring insulin treatment but not L-ase discontinuation. No allergic reaction or pancreatitis was observed. A patient in the Erwinia L-ase-treated group developed deep venous thrombosis on day 7 after the start of L-ase and was treated with subcutaneous heparin (12,500 U x 2/day), with prompt improvement. CONCLUSION: This study shows that the two L-ase formulations have similar effects on hemostasis. Patients treated with Erwinia L-ase may develop thrombotic symptoms, as already reported for E. Coli-L-ase.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hypofibrinogenemia and increased fibrin(ogen) degradation products in acute leukemia have been attributed to intravascular thrombin generation triggered by leukemic cells. However, the strict relationship between fibrinogen catabolism and turnover of fibrinopeptide A (FPA), which is a sensitive and specific marker of thrombin activity, has not been evaluated in acute leukemia (AL) with or without disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) to see whether mechanisms other than thrombin activity could be responsible for fibrinogen consumption. We report here the 125I-fibrinogen kinetics and FPA measurements in 19 patients with AL, 6 of them with DIC. METHODS AND RESULTS. Radiolabelled fibrinogen kinetics were studied in all the patients concomitantly with the start of chemotherapy. Fibrinopeptide A was measured by a radioimmunoassay at time of diagnosis and during chemotherapy. The kinetics of disappearance of radiolabelled fibrinogen where biphasic, with a rapid phase in the first 1-3 days of chemotherapy and a subsequent slow phase associated with the reduction or disappearance of blast cells. Patients with DIC had a significantly shorter half-life and turnover than patients without DIC. The latter group had significant shortening of these parameters in comparison to normal subjects. The thrombin-dependent catabolic rate of fibrinogen, calculated from the mean level of FPA during the first phase of disappearance curve and by assuming 2 moles of FPA generated per mole of fibrinogen, was similar in patients without DIC and in normal subjects, whereas patients with DIC had a significantly higher catabolic rate, even though the increase was not sufficient to account for all the turnover of fibrinogen.

Their natural histories seem to differ from those of older patients and the best treatment is still uncertain. In this follow-up study we have evaluated a cohort of 64 consecutive patients younger than 40 to determine the incidence of thrombohemorrhagic events and the long-term outcome. RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients (20 M; 8 F) had PV, and 36 ET (21 F, 15 M). Mean follow-up was 8.2 years (range 4 months-16.7 years) in PV and 6.5 years (range 5 months-15 years) in ET. Thrombohemorrhagic symptoms were present at diagnosis in 10/28 patients (35%) with PV and in 12/36 patients (33%) with ET; during follow-up in 15/28 PV patients (53%) and in 13/36 ET patients (36%). Thrombotic events were the most frequent symptoms, both at diagnosis (52% in PV, 65% in ET) and during follow-up (43% in PV, 52% in ET). A total of 19/28 PV patients (67%) and 17/36 ET patients (47%) had thrombotic complications. Hemorrhagic complications at diagnosis were 4% and during follow-up 13% in PV, and 15% and 13% in ET. A total of 5/28 (18%) PV and 6/36 (17%) ET patients had hemorrhagic events. No laboratory parameter, including platelet count, was predictive of these events. Five PV patients had major thrombotic complications (18%). Four PV patients died (14%), 2 because of ANLL (7%), 2 because of thrombotic events (7%). Four ET patients experienced major complications, in three cases thrombotic (8.3%), in one hemorrhagic. No leukemic transformation occurred in ET and no ET patient died. CONCLUSIONS: In our experience, severe thrombohemorrhagic complications are present in young patients with PV and ET, which excludes young age as a favorable prognostic factor. Treatment also seems advisable for young patients and myelosuppressive treatment might be required. Prospective studies are urgently needed to assess the best treatment for this particular subset of patients.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As a model of glycoprotein production, a human erythropoietin-encoding cDNA (EPO) inserted downstream from pIFN in pIFP was introduced into human B-cell leukemia-derived BALL-1 cells, and EPO-producing cells were established. Upon stimulation with Sendai virus, the cells produced human EPO at high levels. The highest production level and the highest inducibility were 872 IU/ml and 67-fold, respectively. Simultaneously, the transformed cells also produced IFN-alpha and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), as the parental BALL-1 cells did. Comparing the amounts of the substances produced, activity of the exogenous pIFN introduced seemed much higher than that of the endogenous one. Further, the transformed cells could be obtained in a large quantity by being applied to the 'in vivo cell proliferation method (hamster method)'. Human EPO produced by the transformed cells had a molecular mass range of 35 to 42 kDa, similar to that of EPO produced by CHO cells. The processing of EPO seemed to occur properly. The combination of the human pIFN, BALL-1 cells and the hamster method provides us with a useful production system for bioactive glycoproteins of human origin.","['EPO', 'IFN-&agr;']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

ES and PNE are Primitive Neuroectodermal Tumors (PNETs) and the consistent translocation t(11;22)(q24;q12) can be used for differential diagnosis. In PNETs the 3' part of human FLI1 is translocated from 11q24 to 22q12, where it is juxtaposed to the 5' end of the Ewing's Sarcoma gene (EWS). A fusion transcript, resulting in a chimeric protein, is generated. Here, we present the isolation and detailed characterization of a 250-kb colinear YAC, B45C11, which encompasses the ES and PNE breakpoint on 11q24, as shown by FISSH on ES and PNE chromosomes and interphase nuclei. This YAC represents a new reagent for potential use in rapid differential diagnosis by FISSH on tumor biopsies and on paraffin embedded samples, particularly when DNA and/or RNA are not available for molecular analysis. YAC B45C11, which spans 250 kb of contiguous DNA around the ES and PNE breakpoint, contains the entire FLI1 gene. Three potential HpaII-tiny-fragment (HTF) islands are revealed within the YAC. One of these islands appears to be associated with the 5' end of FLI1, which extends over approximately 120 kb of DNA on 11q24. In addition, we demonstrate that YAC B45C11 contains other transcribed sequences in addition to FLI1, by ""cross-species"" Northern blot hybridizations, which suggests the presence of additional genes in the immediate vicinity of the ES breakpoint on 11q24.",['FLI1'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have detected a rearrangement in the c-MYB proto-oncogene in the cell line CCRF-CEM, an immature T-cell leukemia cell line which is not 6q-. Due to this rearrangement, a large portion of the c-MYB promoter conserved between the human and murine c-MYB genes is lost. The rearranged locus, which we have designated MRR (MYB rearranged region), has been cloned and mapped to chromosome 6. Field inversion gel electrophoresis (FIGE) studies reveal that the MRR sequence is linked to the c-MYB locus, suggesting that the rearrangement is due to a submicroscopic deletion. The rearrangement appears to have no effect on c-MYB promoter activity as analyzed in CCRF-CEM cells. The normal locus of the MRR sequence has been cloned from a human placental genomic library. Partial sequence analysis of this clone reveals that a portion of the DNA lost in the rearrangement shows a high degree of homology to a member of the myc family of oncogenes. Thus the characterization of this rearrangement has yielded a new set of probes for the study of chromosome 6q abnormalities in human leukemias and lymphomas and provides the first evidence for potential involvement of the c-MYB locus itself in submicroscopic deletions within chromosome 6.",['c-MYB'],,,,,['GENBANK/S71085'],,,,,,,,

Investigational new drug (IND) studies have included Phase II trials of intravenous and oral menagaril, 10-EDAM (edatrexate), taxotere, and mifepristone (RU-486) as well as a Phase I/II trial of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), doxorubicin, and vinorelbine (FAN); a Phase I/II trial of 5-FU, leucovorin, doxorubicin, and vinorelbine (super-FAN), all as first-line therapy for metastatic disease; and a Phase III study of vinorelbine plus doxorubicin versus doxorubicin alone as first- or second-line metastatic therapy. A proposed study with the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer in locally advanced breast cancer will compare a standard NCIC CTG regimen of cyclophosphamide, epirubicin, and 5-FU (CEF) with epirubicin and cyclophosphamide granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), a more dose-intensive regimen. In addition, NCIC CTG is preparing a pilot of CEF with G-CSF to examine whether a substantially more intensive dosage can be given without added toxicity. NCIC CTG will also enter patients into a currently active Cancer and Leukemia Group B/Southwest Oncology Group randomized trial of intensive therapy versus more intensive therapy with bone marrow support in women younger than age 60 with 10 or more positive nodes.

METHODS: Between January 1984 and September 1992, 81 consecutive patients, 40 affected with CLL and 41 with low grade NHL, with symptomatic Stage III and IV disease, were treated with TBI followed by prednimustine. TBI was given with a 6 MV linear accelerator, applying two opposite alternating fields, including total body, with two fractions of 15 cGy given per week (3-day interval). A total dose of 150 cGy was given over 5 weeks. Six to nine courses of prednimustine (100 mg/m2 orally for 5 consecutive days every 4 weeks) was administered 2 months after TBI treatment as consolidation therapy. RESULTS: Of 40 patients with CLL, 18 (Group I; median age 58.5 years) were younger than 65 years and 22 (Group II; median age 73 years) were older. The overall response rates were 78% in Group I and 91% in Group II, with a median response time of 16.5 and 16 months, respectively. Hematologic toxicity was 72% in Group I and 73% in Group II. It was reversible in all but one heavily pretreated patient who died of progressive anemia and thrombocytopenia after TBI alone. In the 40 patients with CLL, the response rate was 85%; there were 5 complete responses (CRs) (12.5%) and 29 partial responses (PRs) (72.5%). Of the 41 patients with NHL, 29 (Group I; median age 55 years) were younger than 65 years and 12 (Group II; median age 71.5) were older. The overall response rate in both groups was 83%, with median response times of 18.5+ and 14.5+ months for Groups I and II, respectively. Hematologic toxicity was 59% in Group I, whereas it was 50% in Group II. It was reversible in all patients. Overall, in the 41 patients with symptomatic Stage III and IV low grade NHL, the response rate was 82.8%; there were 10 CRs (24.3%) and 24 PRs (58.5%). The prednimustine regimen was generally well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: In our experience, TBI given in a dose of 150 cGy in 10 fractions twice a week, followed by prednimustine, is an effective treatment for patients with CLL and patients with low grade NHL. This treatment also is effective in patients older than 65 years. The toxicity is acceptable, particularly when TBI and prednimustine are given as initial treatment. Pretreated patients should be monitored strictly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tests were performed to evaluate the capacity of the drug to interfere with erythroid differentiation. Cells were exposed to a single treatment in S phase at sublethal doses of bacitracin. Two responses were found depending on the drug concentration. At higher concentrations (25 micrograms/ml and 250 ng/ml) a reduction in number of differentiating cells was observed but the kinetics of the process remained unchanged. At lower concentrations (from 2.5 ng/ml to 2.5 fg/ml) a dramatic alteration of the dynamic of differentiation was found. These two responses are related to different activities of the DNA repair mechanisms. Higher doses of bacitracin stimulate repair while lower concentrations are not able to active repair, as demonstrated by tests with hydroxyurea. The bacitracin-induced damage can be considered a stable genetic and/or epigenetic alteration, as demonstrated by the high frequency of mutant clones isolated from low-dose treated cells.

Alternative splicing gives rise to secreted and intracellular forms of IL-1ra. Both forms block cellular responses to IL-1 by occupying IL-1 receptors without triggering an agonist response. The affinity of IL-1ra for the type I IL-1 receptor is approximately that of IL-1. However, because of IL-1's pronounced ""spare receptor"" effect, IL-1ra is a weak inhibitor of biological responses to IL-1. The value for the affinity constant of IL-1ra's binding to the type II IL-1 receptor has been the subject of disagreement. However, recent data suggest that human IL-1ra has only weak affinity for the human type II receptor. This is consistent with the likelihood that the type II receptor plays no role in signal transduction, instead being a ""decoy"" that can be shed as a soluble receptor with the ability bind, and thus inhibit, IL-1. Under the name Antril, IL-1ra is being tested in clinical trials of a number of human diseases where IL-1 plays a major pathophysiologic role. These diseases include sepsis, rheumatoid arthritis, chronic myelogenous leukemia, and asthma, among others. Although IL-1ra has clear pharmacologic potential in such conditions, its application in chronic diseases is limited by difficulties associated with delivering proteins as drugs. As an alternative, we have suggested transfer of the gene coding for IL-1ra; strategies for both local and systemic gene delivery are being developed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The two T-cell leukemias exhibited clonal T-cell receptor gene rearrangements and in one JH and kappa light chain rearrangements also.

The first human retrovirus HTLV-I (human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I) is considered to be related to its aetiology. In ATL endemic areas, HTLV-I carriers form a fairly high percentage of the population, even among healthy individuals. ATL shows diverse clinical features. It can be divided into four subtypes: acute, chronic, smouldering and lymphoma type. ATL cells originate from the CD4-positive subset of peripheral T cells; they show a characteristic notch in the nucleus and a tendency to lobulation. ATL resists chemotherapy, and patients with acute and lymphoma types have a fairly poor prognosis. A definite diagnosis of ATL is made by documenting the presence of HTLV-I proviral DNA in the DNA of tumour cells. HTLV-I infection is caused by transmission of live lymphocytes via three routes (from mother to child, from males to females, and by transfusion). Familial occurrence of ATL is frequently seen. HTLV-I infection is seen in other countries, but its incidence is highest in Japan. Infection with HTLV-I is a direct cause of ATL. Furthermore, infection with this virus can indirectly cause many other diseases via the induction of immunodeficiency, such as chronic lung disease, opportunistic lung infection, cancer of other organs, monoclonal gammopathy, chronic renal failure, strongyloidiasis, non-specific dermatomycosis, HTLV-I-associated lymphadenitis, HTLV-I uveitis and HTLV-I-associated myelopathy-tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The advent of clinical staging systems, which allow the identification of patients with different risks and the planning of appropriate therapy, constitutes a major advance. Results of trials based on these staging systems have demonstrated that treatment of patients with CLL in early stage is of no benefit and may even be harmful. By contrast, there is general agreement that patients in advanced stage should be treated. Chlorambucil, either daily or intermittently, and given alone or with corticosteroids, remains the most commonly used drug. Other single agents used in CLL include prednisone, busulphan and cyclophosphamide. Results are often comparable with those observed with chlorambucil alone, although sometimes with more toxicity. The benefit in survival terms of all these drugs remains to be proved. New agents, such as fludarabine, 2-deoxycoformycin and 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine, offer promise. However, the superiority of these drugs over chlorambucil needs to be demonstrated in randomized trials. Most combination therapy regimens have failed to show advantage over chlorambucil with or without prednisone when compared in clinical trials. In a previous randomized trial, the French Co-operative Group on CLL showed a beneficial role for low-dose adriamycin given with cyclophosphamide, vincristine and prednisone (mini-CHOP) in patients with stage C disease. However, these results were obtained in a small series of patients and need to be confirmed. Splenectomy can be considered in patients with autoimmune haemolytic anaemia or thrombocytopenia, with splenic destruction. Radiotherapy, administered either as 32P, total body irradiation, extracorporeal irradiation of blood or thymic irradiation, is effective in a few patients, but severe myelosuppression is a frequent sequel. Splenic irradiation has more often been used when splenectomy was difficult in the case of massive splenomegaly or immune cytopenia. New strategies, including the use of biological response modifiers (interferons, interleukins 2 and 4, erythropoietin, cyclosporine and monoclonal antibodies either alone or conjugated with immunotoxins), are presently under study. So far, only transient effects have been observed. Although complete remission in classical terms is frequently observed with these therapies, clonal remission is a very rare event and cure cannot be achieved.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Based on the notion that the clinical manifestations of CLL are due primarily to the progressive accumulation of lymphocytes over time, several prognostic factors have been identified. The prognostic value of parameters reflecting tumour burden (i.e. lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, anaemia and/or thrombocytopenia due to bone marrow failure), first identified empirically, has been confirmed in multivariate analyses of large series of patients. Furthermore, clinical staging systems that group the most relevant of these factors have also been developed. Patients in early stage (Binet A; Rai 0) have a long survival which, in some cases, may match that of the general population. In contrast, patients with advanced stage (Binet C; Rai III or IV) have a median survival < 2 years. The major limitation of staging systems is that they do not give information about the likelihood of progression for patients in early stage. Nevertheless, haemoglobin level, blood lymphocyte count, lymphocyte doubling time and bone marrow infiltration pattern are useful to identify subsets of patients in early stage with different progression and survival rates, with the 'smouldering' form of the disease being identified fairly accurately. With all these advances, therapy in CLL can now be indicated on a more rational basis. However, further biological insight is needed to elucidate the mechanism accounting for the different forms of the disease.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Clonal chromosomal abnormalities are found in about half of the patients, and one third of those with clonal aberrations have trisomy 12, with or without additional changes. The most common structural abnormalities involve the long arm of chromosome 13, usually as deletions involving 13q14, the site of the retinoblastoma gene. Other recurrent abnormalities are deletions of the long arms of chromosome 11 and 6. 14q+ markers are frequent in patients at advanced stage, but are almost always within complex abnormalities. The number of clonal abnormalities in the CLL cells has a strong prognostic impact. Trisomy 12 as a single abnormality is an adverse prognostic sign, whereas patients with 13q abnormalities generally do comparatively well. Lymphoid leukaemia with monoclonal immunoglobulin secretion frequently involves clonal chromosomal abnormalities, and the type of change is similar to that seen in true CLL. In B cell prolymphocytic leukaemia, t(11;14) is a common finding, together with trisomy 12. T cell prolymphocytic leukaemia is characterized by an inversion of the long arm of chromosome 14, with breaks at q11 and q32, and trisomy of 8q, whereas large granular lymphocytic leukaemia has shown no consistent abnormality.

It has been postulated that Ly1 B cells (the murine counterpart of human CD5+B cells) constitute a separate B cell lineage. Whether the CD5 marker defines a discrete lineage or is a maturation marker is one of the main issues that might be solved in the near future. Another recent advance has been the discovery that the B lymphocyte in CLL is in an activated state and can be induced to differentiate. Using B cell mitogens and somatic hybridization, it has been demonstrated that the B-CLL lymphocyte is frequently involved in the production of natural autoantibodies and expresses a restricted set of genes. These results may provide a basis for passive immunotherapy using anti-idiotypic antibodies. Hypogammaglobulinaemia is a distinct feature of B-CLL, observed in 60% of patients. It may result from impaired function of residual normal B cells. This could occur as a consequence of progressive dilution of normal non-clonal B cells, or because normal B cells are downregulated by an unknown mechanism. This decrease in or inhibition of normal CD5-B cells could also explain the classical inability of patients with B-CLL to respond to new antigenic challenges, since Ly1 B cells have been claimed to be unable to respond to exogenous antigens. Although regulatory abnormalities in T cells may play a role in the induction of hypogammaglobulinaemia, data concerning helper, suppressive, NK and ADCC cells are contradictory and fail to establish firmly the contribution of these cells in the development of hypogammaglobulinaemia. Associated autoimmune phenomena are a prominent complication in CLL. They are related to the presence of autoantibodies directed mainly against blood components, which in most cases are not the product of the malignant clone. The relationship between autoimmune phenomena and hypogammaglobulinaemia is not definitively substantiated. That hypogammaglobulinaemia may determine the loss of some anti-idiotypic antibodies designed to antagonize autoimmune clones is an attractive hypothesis, which needs to be substantiated. Several recurrent chromosomal abnormalities, such as trisomy 12, structural aberrations of the 13q14 and 14q32 bands, are frequently observed in B-CLL. Less frequently, alterations of chromosomes 11, 6, 18, 3, 17, 7 and 8 have been reported.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",['bcl-2'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

The technique of homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells has allowed the production of mice with selectively disrupted genes that are important for B cell development in mice. At the same time, functional studies of human B cell differentiation, together with analysis of naturally occurring mutations that disrupt this process, have progressed rapidly. This has provided insight into the pathogenesis of lymphoproliferative and immunodeficiency diseases as well as a clearer view of normal developmental events. In this chapter we have reviewed human B cell differentiation with particular emphasis on newly emerging concepts. We also discussed CD5, a pan-T cell antigen that is expressed in low levels on a subpopulation of B cells implicated in the pathogenesis of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL).

We have developed a model experimental system to measure cell adhesion as a function of cell and surface chemistry and fluid flow. Using a parallel-plate flow chamber, we measured the binding of rat basophilic leukemia cells preincubated with anti-dinitrophenol IgE antibody to polyacrylamide gels covalently derivatized with 2,4-dinitrophenol. The rat basophilic leukemia cells' binding behavior is binary: cells are either adherent or continue to travel at their hydrodynamic velocity, and the transition between these two states is abrupt. The spatial location of adherent cells shows cells can adhere many cell diameters down the length of the gel, suggesting that adhesion is a probabilistic process. The majority of experiments were performed in the excess ligand limit in which adhesion depends strongly on the number of receptors but weakly on ligand density. Only 5-fold changes in IgE surface density or in shear rate were necessary to change adhesion from complete to indistinguishable from negative control. Adhesion showed a hyperbolic dependence on shear rate. By performing experiments with two IgE-antigen configurations in which the kinetic rates of receptor-ligand binding are different, we demonstrate that the forward rate of reaction of the receptor-ligand pair is more important than its thermodynamic affinity in the regulation of binding under hydrodynamic flow. In fact, adhesion increases with increasing receptor-ligand reaction rate or decreasing shear rate, and scales with a single dimensionless parameter which compares the relative rates of reaction to fluid shear.",,PMC1275831,,,,,,,,,,,,

A bone marrow transplant recipient developed orofacial lesions due to infection with herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) that failed to respond to therapy with both acyclovir and foscarnet. After topical application of HPMPC, the HSV-2 lesions completely resolved. However, the lesions recurred 3 weeks later, and, upon subsequent treatment with HPMPC, regressed. On recurrence, the virus was found to be sensitive to acyclovir, which the patient was given. Again HSV-2, which was resistant to acyclovir, emerged; similar observations were made after another cycle of HPMPC therapy. The HSV-1 isolates were resistant to acyclovir and foscarnet. Following local HPMPC treatment, the lesions regressed, but after 1 week, a second course of topical HPMPC therapy had to be instituted for recurrent infection. The lesions again regressed, and as the recurrent virus was sensitive to acyclovir, the patient was successfully treated with the drug.

Outcome measures were relapse/no relapse and time to first relapse. Influence of weight for height, expressed as standard deviation scores, was tested using survival analysis in a retrospective design. RESULTS: The weight-for-height standard deviation score had a significant influence on time until first relapse (log ranks test, p = 0.012), with the highest risk of early relapse in children at the lower end of the weight-for-height distribution. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that weight for height does have an influence on outcome in ALL, but the mechanism is unclear and the finding requires confirmation by larger scale prospective studies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to assess the clinical implications of TF in plasma, plasma concentration of TF was quantitated in 65 patients with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The mean concentration of plasma TF was elevated in patients with DIC at presentation as compared with healthy subjects (446 +/- SD 536 pg/ml vs. 138 +/- 51 pg/ml, P < 0.001). Abnormally high levels were found only in 46.2% of the patients, predominantly in patients with non-hematological solid tumors and acute leukemia. Plasma TF did not correlate with hemostatic markers of DIC such as thrombin-antithrombin III complex, prothrombin fragment 1 + 2, plasma-alpha 2-plasmin inhibitor complex, FDP, D-dimer, or fibrinogen. Serial determinations of plasma TF demonstrated that plasma TF changes roughly in parallel with the course of DIC in most patients with elevated TF at presentation of DIC.

DNAs were analyzed for p53 gene mutations in exons 5 to 9 by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP), and direct sequencing of PCR-amplified products. Mutant p53 alleles were detected in 5 of 70 cases; 1 case in exon 5, 2 cases in exon 6, and 2 cases in exon 7. The alterations of the p53 gene were represented by point mutation leading to an amino acid substitution in four cases, and deletion in the remaining case. In four of the five cases, direct sequencing indicated the loss of the normal p53 allele; in the remaining case, two mutations were detected, presumably involving both p53 alleles. Three cases showed mutations at diagnosis; in the remaining two, the mutations were observed in clinical relapse but not at diagnosis. Our results confirm the relatively low incidence of p53 mutations in AML and further support the evidence that p53 plays a role in leukemogenesis through a recessive mechanism (two-hit model) of inactivation of tumor suppressor activity.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast, lymphoblastic lymphomas (n = 4) were positive for CD3 and CD43 but negative for CD68, lysozyme, CD31, CD34, LN5, and myeloperoxidase. Lymphocytic lymphomas (n = 10) were positive for CD20 and CD43 but negative for all other markers. Small, round-cell tumors (n = 15) were negative for all markers. If T-cell and B-cell differentiation can be excluded with other markers, CD43+ is a sensitive marker for myeloid differentiation.

For comparison, tumor infiltrates from five monoblastic leukemias were also analyzed. The histiocytic sarcomas were all high-grade malignancies consisting of markedly pleomorphic large cells with many mitotic figures. At presentation, six of the patients had systemic symptoms (fever, fatigue, loss of weight), skin infiltrates, and lymphadenopathy. Despite aggressive chemotherapy, clinical remissions were short, and six patients died of disease .5-48 months (mean, 6.5 months) after diagnosis. The remaining two patients are alive and in partial or complete remission 7 and 12 months after diagnosis. Immunotypic examination showed that all the histiocytic sarcomas were positive for macrophage-related antigens and negative for antigens on B cells, T cells, myeloid cells, epithelial cells, and melanocytes. T-cell receptor and immunoglobulin genes were studied in three cases and were present in a germline configuration. One of the histiocytic sarcomas resembled Langerhans' cells in phenotype and morphology; it was classified as a Langerhans' cell sarcoma. The remaining histiocytic sarcomas did not express accessory cell-associated antigens, but more closely resembled ""ordinary"" tissue macrophages; they were positive for lysozyme and/or CD68, followed in frequency by CD11c, CD4, CD11b, CDw32, peanut agglutinin receptor, and CD13. Similar features were seen in the monoblastic leukemias. These conditions could only be distinguished from histiocytic sarcoma by clinical and morphologic, rather than immunophenotypic, criteria. Expression of oncoprotein p53 was studied in nine cases and was positive in six of six histiocytic sarcomas and one of three monoblastic leukemias. Rare malignancies show features consistent with the derivation from macrophages. Two entities may be distinguished: those that resemble antigen-presenting accessory cells and those that more closely resemble ordinary tissue macrophages. Recognition of these tumors is important clinically and requires assessment of clinical, morphologic, and immunophenotypic features, supplemented by analysis of T-cell receptor and immunoglobulin genes. Whether (or how) p53 gene mutations are implicated in their pathogenesis will be an important topic for future investigation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One hundred and sixteen of the 266 (44%) platelet transfusions failed to produce a satisfactory response. In 102/116 (88%), the poor response was in the presence of non-immune factors known to be associated with platelet refractoriness. Non-immune factors were present alone in 78/116 (67%), and in combination with immune factors in a further 24/116 (21%). Immune factors (HLA and platelet-specific antibodies) were present during 29/116 (25%) of unsuccessful platelet transfusions. Statistical analysis confirmed that platelet refractoriness was significantly associated with the presence of non-immune factors. The non-immune factors associated with refractoriness were often multiple, most frequently a combination of fever, infection and antibiotic therapy. This study provides evidence that immune mechanisms were not the predominant cause of platelet refractoriness in the patient population studied. It also suggests that measures for the prevention of HLA alloimmunisation, such as leucocyte depletion, may have a limited impact in reducing the incidence of refractoriness to platelet transfusions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, time trends of the etiology of bacteremia among hematological patients in Copenhagen (eastern Denmark) and in Arhus (western Denmark) were compared. In contrast to many other studies, a significant increase in the proportion of Gram-negative aerobes was observed in Copenhagen (from 43% in 1981-85 to 55% in 1990; p < 0.05), whereas in Arhus the proportion of Gram-positive aerobes increased steadily during the 1980s (from 34% to 51%; p < 0.05).

Several factors may contribute to the reported differences in the etiology of bacteremia among hematological patients, e.g. criteria used to assign the clinical significance of the isolate, blood culture system used, practice of using indwelling intravenous catheters, different policies with respect to antimicrobial treatment, and the degree of immunosuppression. A local surveillance of blood culture isolates is mandatory if changes in etiology and resistance development are to be detected.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The large series of treated patients have shown the remarkable efficacy of 32P. This is particularly evident when comparing the recent series of patients treated with 32P with those of Videbaek whose patients were treated by phlebotomies only. Patients are treated one time with 3.7 x 10(6) mBq (0.1 mCi) of 33P per kg of body weight. Granulocytes and platelets are rapidly affected, whereas red cells show a response 3 months later due to their longer survival. Remission lasts from a few months to three years. If the result is not satisfactory, another dose can be given 3 months after the first one. Resistance to 32P may arise but may be reversible after a course of chemotherapy. The clear therapeutic effect of 32P renders it especially valuable for patients with a high vascular risk. Some authors have claimed that polycythemia vera evolves towards acute leukemia, but Modan's study has demonstrated that 32P is indeed responsible for the occurrence of acute leukemia; this has been largely confirmed by others. The dose to the bone marrow is not negligible and the leukemic incidence following the treatment is a factor which limits its indication. Trials were conducted to search for therapies with alkylating agents, such as Chlorambucil or Busulphan, which would be less leukemogenic. The Polycythemia Vera Study Group found that Chlorambucil was at least 2.3 fold more leukemogenic than 32P. The EORTC compared the leukemogenic effect of 32P with that of Busulphan.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since the definition given in 1975 by the Polycythemia Vera Study Group (PVSG), some examinations became obsolete, and new ones (erythropoietin, stem cell culture) did appear, so that it seems useful to re-define the criteria of the disease. On another hand, the financial problems of our health systems make necessary do define what biological tests are really useful. As the vascular complications are the main risk of these patients, it would be useful to define what type of study is necessary for predicting the risk and also what preventive treatment could be advised. Such a study has presently never been done. Many questions still remain un-solved concerning the treatment. Beyond which age are the advantages of 32 P higher than the risk of leukemia? Is the chemotherapy by hydroxyurea or vercyte as easy to use than it is perhaps too often said? What is the best treatment, able to delay the development of myelofibrosis?

Analysis of T cell populations in both patients showed that the cells containing the translocation became oligoclonal with respect to T cell receptor beta rearrangement and complete T cell receptor beta clonality was only established in the patient with t(X;14) by onset of overt disease.

Indeed, a decrease in AP-1 DNA binding activity was seen in response to both inducing stimuli. This decrease in AP-1 binding activity may be mediated by an increase in the activity of an AP-1 inhibitory factor, as the steady state levels of jun protein remained constant during the onset of apoptosis, and cytosolic AP-1 inhibitory activity was found to increase, concomitant with the decrease in AP-1 DNA binding activity.

The BCL-1/cyclin D1 protein was easily detectable in both immunocytochemistry and immunoblotting, its abundance grossly correlating with the mRNA levels. The cyclin D1 protein was localised predominantly to nuclei and there was a striking variation of staining intensity among the exponentially growing cells, reflecting the maximum level reached in mid/late G1 and the lowest level in S-phase. This characteristic mode of cell cycle-dependent oscillation was confirmed by three independent approaches, demonstrating that even upon rearrangement, the expression of cyclin D1 is regulated in a cyclical manner. Antibody-mediated and anti-sense oligonucleotide 'knockout' experiments revealed that the aberrantly expressed BCL-1/cyclin D1 protein is required for G1 phase progression of all four B-cell tumours with the BCL-1 rearrangement. Consistent with the proposed oncogenic role of this cyclin, our data demonstrate that the BCL-1 deregulation caused by chromosomal rearrangement leads to expression of a functionally active cyclin D1 protein which subverts the G1 phase control in the human B-cell tumours carrying the t(11;14) translocation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Proliferation stimulated by IL-2 is dependent upon ligand binding to p75, a component of the high-affinity receptor. As with other cells exhibiting dual receptor systems, a central question is, therefore: what is the role of the low-affinity receptor population? We apply a mathematical modeling approach to examine three alternative mechanisms that have been suggested for the role of low-affinity receptors: a ligand reservoir, a receptor reservoir, and a ligand carrier. Using model parameter values specific to the IL-2/T-cell system, we find that only the ligand carrier mechanism leads to binding of autocrine ligand to high-affinity receptors that is increased over levels found on a single, pre-formed high-affinity receptor population. With the ligand reservoir and the receptor reservoir mechanisms, the presence of the low-affinity receptors actually diminishes high-affinity receptor binding due to competition. In contrast, excess low-affinity receptors can act to enhance the level of high-affinity receptor complexes when membrane transport is included, indicating that should this mechanism be inhibited, cell response could potentially be reduced or eliminated. The ligand carrier effect is especially significant for cells expressing a large number (> 10(5) receptors/cell) low-affinity receptors, and at low cell densities (< 10(4) cells/ml). This may at least partially account for the behavior demonstrated by early phase adult T-cell leukemia cells.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, once cells were transformed by tax, beta-Gal but not tax expression was suppressed. Supertransformation of these cells with v-src suppressed both beta-Gal and tax expression. This suppression was reversed by treatment with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor herbimycin A or protein kinase A inhibitor H8. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated augmented binding in the R but not U3 region. This binding was competitively inhibited by a high-affinity CREB oligodeoxynucleotide and super-shifted with a specific CREB antibody. Treatment of cells with the cyclic AMP analog dibutyryl cyclic AMP also transiently increased the R region binding dramatically. In vitro DNase I footprint analysis identified a protein-binding sequence in the R region which corresponded with suppression. However, this target sequence lacked a conventional CREB-binding site.

We isolated three types of cDNAs encoding Cys2/His2-type zinc finger proteins that bind to this region. Two were identical to known transcription factors, EGR1 and EGR2, and the other clone, named DB1, encoded a novel protein of 516 amino acids with six zinc finger motifs. DB1 mRNA was present in human tissues, ubiquitously. Two constitutive transcripts of 4.0 and 4.8 kb in length were present in Jurkat cells. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay, with specific antibodies, showed that DB1 constitutively binds to this region whereas EGR1 binds in a T-cell activation-dependent manner. Overexpression of DB1 in Jurkat cells had no detectable effect on the transcription activity of the IL-3 promoter, in a transient-transfection assay. EGR1 and EGR2 increased IL-3 promoter activity when the transfected cells were stimulated with phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate and A23187. When DB1 was cotransfected with a Tax expression vector, transcription activity of the IL-3 promoter induced by Tax was significantly increased, while EGR1 and EGR2 were without effect. These results suggest that EGR1 has a role in inducible transcription of the IL-3 gene, while DB1 sustains basal transcriptional activity and also cooperates with Tax to activate the IL-3 promoter.",,PMC359028,,,,['GENBANK/D28118'],,,,,,,,

Although GIRE-BP is detected in cells of different origins after IFN-gamma treatment, the presence of MATE-BP was found to be restricted to B- and myeloid cell lines. Sequence analysis of a cDNA encoding a polypeptide recognizing specifically the MATE motif led to the identification of this product as the proto-oncogene PU.1/Spi-1, a transcriptional activator expressed in myeloid and B cells. Expression of this factor in nonhematopoietic cells allowed IFN-gamma-induced expression of a reporter gene under control of the GRR and MATE sequences.

A rapid decrease in the peripheral leukemic blasts numbers was observed in six patients. We were unable to demonstrate at the bone marrow level a diminution in the percentage of leukemic blasts. However an increase in the expression of the adhesion molecule CD54/ICAM-1(LFA-1 ligand) affected the leukemic bone marrow blasts of these six patients. This increase in CD54 was found in eight of the 11 (73%) AML and four out of the ten (40%) ALL blasts and CD58/LFA-3 (CD2 ligand) to a lesser extent. This increased expression was not associated with modifications in the expression of MHC class II molecules. In vivo IL-2 also dramatically modified the bone marrow T-cell subsets via the increase of CD3+ cells expressing the CD45RO 'memory' marker (six out of the eight tested patients) or CD54 (seven out of the eight tested patients).

We therefore compared the resistance to 12 drugs of 125 ALL and 28 ANLL samples with the MTT assay. ALL samples were median > 75-fold more sensitive to the glucocorticoids prednisolone and dexamethasone (p < 0.00001), and 2-fold more sensitive to vincristine (p = 0.05) than ANLL samples. Differences for the other drugs were not significant. MyAg-negative ALL samples were more sensitive to glucocorticoids than MyAg-positive ALL-samples (p < or = 0.04). Prednisolone, and dexamethasone if tested, had a stimulatory effect on leukemic cell survival in 36% of ANLL, but in only 2% of ALL samples (p < 0.0001). Vincristine, and vindesine if tested, had a similar effect in 11% of ANLL, and in 4% of ALL samples (p = 0.11). We conclude that the more favorable response of ALL against ANLL to combination chemotherapy in children may be explained by the higher antileukemic activity of glucocorticoids and of vincristine in ALL, while none of the drugs was more active in ANLL. Similarly, the better prognosis of MyAg-negative ALL than of MyAg-positive ALL may be explained by a relative sensitivity to glucocorticoids. Glucocorticoids and vinca-alkaloids induced leukemia cell proliferation in part of the samples, most frequently in ANLL. The findings may be useful in the design of new chemotherapeutic regimens for ALL and ANLL.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All but six patients received blood products (median 7 units, range 0-246), with approximately 90% given during the 6-week induction period. Because all 16 patients who received > or = 50 units failed, the number of units transfused was predictive of treatment failure in multivariate analysis (relative risk = 1.8, p = 0.02), although the number of units transfused was also associated with initial leukocyte count and age. Among the remaining 342 patients who received < 50 units, the number of units transfused was associated with reduced event-free survival in univariate analysis only, with maximal significance at > 7 units (p = 0.006). Because exclusion of the 16 patients who received the most blood eliminates the independent effect of transfusions on patient outcome, we believe that the number of transfusions is largely an epiphenomenon which reflects the effects of two risk factors not included in traditional outcome analysis in childhood ALL.

Specifically, retrovirus integration has been monitored in clones derived from C1-V13D at the primary, secondary and tertiary passage through thymus using probes specific for long terminal repeat (LTR), gag, pol and env genes of RadLV. The data indicate multiple ecotropic retrovirus integration sites in C1-V13D cells. Primary thymic tumors also showed the integration of a new recombinant or defective virus.

To determine whether NDMTmx was as active as the parent compound in restoring sensitivity to daunorubicin (DNR) in vitro, we performed uptake and retention studies in the MDR-positive human leukemia cell lines CEM-VLB and HL-60/RV+ using laser flow cytometry to quantitate intracellular DNR concentration.

Cellular retention of DNR was also measured after incubation with Tmx 10 microM or NDMTmx 10 microM and resuspension in fresh medium containing Tmx or NDMTmx in order to stimulate in vivo conditions. Washout curves in both cell lines were similar with both Tmx and NDMTmx. Finally, clonogenic experiments were performed to determine whether Tmx and NDMTmx demonstrated the same degree of cytotoxicity. The combination of Tmx 10 microM plus DNR and that of NDMTmx 10 microM plus DNR each resulted in > 80% growth inhibition.

NDGA inhibited A23187-induced c-fos mRNA expression by a similar magnitude as IL-4, whereas the effect of indomethacin was only minor. A23187-induced c-jun mRNA expression was not affected by indomethacin and only slightly inhibited by NDGA. These results indicate that in human monocytes c-fos mRNA expression is at least partly controlled by the lipoxygenase directed pathway of AA metabolism, whereas the cyclooxygenase dependent pathway is not involved in the regulation of proto-oncogene expression. This was supported by the finding that leukotriene B4 (LTB4) and 5'-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (5'-HPTETE), which are two lipoxygenase metabolites, strongly induced c-fos mRNA, whereas c-jun mRNA expression was slightly affected.

Although pseudogenes account for 46% of the V genes in the kappa locus none were ever rearranged, even in non-functional rearrangements of lambda-producing leukemias, suggesting the existence of a mechanism which down-regulates the rearrangement of pseudogenes. N regions were noted at the VJ junction in 20% of alleles (in six CLL, three NHL, two ALL and one myeloma) possibly the result of kappa-chain recombination during the early period of B-cell maturation in which TdT is expressed. Nucleotide addition or imprecise joining at the VJ junction, resulting in a shift in the reading frame, were the commonest causes of non-functional rearrangement. The occurrence of somatic mutation broadly correlated with the stage of B-cell maturation from which the different disorders are thought to arise. However, there was no strict association and somatic mutations were demonstrated in 'typical CLL' while V kappa genes were germline in some follicular lymphomas; these findings suggest either heterogeneity in the stage of B-cell maturation at which these disorders arise or some variability in the process of somatic mutation.",['V&kgr;'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

P185 BCR-ABL has previously been shown to be expressed in most cases of Ph+ acute leukemia of myeloid and B-progenitor origin.

Finally, comparison of the T-ALLbcr, BCR-ABL, IGH, TCR beta and gamma gene rearrangements in leukemic cells obtained at the time of diagnosis and at first relapse showed that relapse occurred in a leukemic clone indistinguishable from the major Ph+ clone involved at diagnosis.

Normal or 5-FU-treated Ficoll bone marrow cells (BMC), or BMCs sorted on CD34 or HLA-DR expression, or Rh123 retention, (input range 40-70,000 CFU-GM/BFU-E/10(5) cells) were plated at limiting dilution on unirradiated adherent layers formed by a novel murine preadipose cell line (FBMD-1). The percentage of wells with at least one phase-dark haematopoietic clone (cobblestone area, CA) beneath the stromal layer was weekly determined for at least 8 weeks, and CA-forming cell (CAFC) frequencies were calculated using Poisson statistics. Parallel LTBMCs of the same samples were weekly assessed for supernate CFU-GM/BFU-E production. Weekly addition of rhIL-3 with rhG-CSF supported a high average clonogenic output per CA and dramatically increased CA size, but did not significantly alter the apparent CAFC frequency. The generation of CFU-GM per CA was constant over a period of 6 weeks with weekly means of eight normal BM samples, ranging between 5-16. At week 6 the mean CAFC frequency was 29 (1 SEM, 8.8)/10(5). Early appearing CAFC were highly sensitive to 5-FU, and were contained over the full Rh123 and HLA-DR fluorescence profile of CD34pos cells, whereas CAFC week 5-8 were predominantly contained in the CD34pos Rh123dull HLA-DRlow fraction in agreement with previously reported LTC-IC characteristics. In conclusion, the CAFC assay enumerates LTC-IC using a direct visual endpoint and allows study of LTC-IC heterogeneity with respect to progenitor cell generation per stem cell clone in various haematologic diseases.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, a recombinant virus isolated from a leukemic HRS/J mouse and another from a CWD mouse contained U3 regions that lacked genetic markers of Bxv-1. The U3 regions of both recombinants were derived from the endogenous ecotropic virus Env-1 and had retained a single enhancer element. However, compared with that of Emv-1, the U3 region of each of the recombinant viruses contained five nucleotide substitutions, one of which was shared. To determine the biological significance of these substitutions, chimeric ecotropic viruses that contained the U3 region from one of the two recombinant viruses or from Emv-1 were injected into NIH Swiss mice. All three of the chimeric ecotropic viruses were leukemogenic following a long latency. Despite the presence of an enhancer core motif that is known to contribute to the leukemogenicity of the AKR MuLV SL3-3, the HRS/J virus U3 region induced lymphomas only slightly more rapidly than the allelic Emv-1 sequences. The chimeric virus with the U3 region of the CWD recombinant caused lymphomas more frequently and more rapidly than either of the other two viruses. The results support the hypothesis that one or more of the five nucleotide substitutions in the U3 regions of the recombinants contribute to viral pathogenicity. Comparison of DNA sequences suggests that the pathogenicity of the CWD virus U3 region was related to a sequence motif that is shared with Bxv-1 and is recognized by the basic helix-loop-helix class of transcription factors.",,PMC236461,,,,['GENBANK/S71537'],,,,,,,,

Linder, D. Linder, J. Hahnen, H.-H. Schott, and Stirm, Eur. J. Biochem. 203:65-73, 1992). In the carboxy-terminal constant domain, in which these glycoproteins have about 97% sequence homology, the location of the four disulfide bonds was found to be analogous. In the amino-terminal differential domain, with about 37% sequence homology, 8 of the 12 cysteine residues of the ecotropic SU are conserved in the polytropic SU. In this domain, a similar clustering of disulfide bonds was detected, which led to the identification of three distinct disulfide-bonded regions in both glycoproteins. However, because of deletions and sequence deviations, the glycoproteins must have significantly different three-dimensional structures in these regions. Since the receptor-binding functions of both glycoproteins have been attributed to their amino-terminal domains and since each binds to a different receptor, these disulfide-bonded structures are likely candidates for receptor-binding functions. Limited proteolysis of both glycoproteins with various endoproteinases led to the identification of preferential proteolytic sites between disulfide-bonded regions, at the beginning of the hypervariable proline-rich region, and between differential and constant domains, further confirming the structural organization of the folded glycoproteins.",,PMC236457,,,,,,,,,,,,

It also dissociates into monomers at a lower temperature than the wild-type dimer. Thus, the dimer in PR- particles is in a conformation different from that in wild-type particles. These results are quite similar to recent findings on Moloney murine leukemia virus and suggest that a postassembly, PR-dependent maturation event is a common feature in genomic RNAs of retroviruses. We also measured the thermal stability of the wild-type and PR- dimeric RNAs under different ionic conditions. Both forms of the dimer were stabilized by increasing Na+ concentrations. However, the melting temperatures of the two forms were not significantly affected by the identity of the monovalent cation present in the incubation buffer. This observation is in contrast with recent reports on dimers formed in vitro from short segments of HIV-1 sequence: the latter dimers are specifically stabilized by K+ ions.

MHC genes located in the A, D, and Qa/Tla regions of the murine H-2 complex have been shown to affect disease resistance through their capacity to regulate various aspects of the host immune response to viral antigens. This study establishes H-2E as the fourth MHC locus controlling immunological resistance to FV. Our investigation into the role of H-2E molecules revealed two distinct and opposite effects on recovery from Friend disease. H-2b/b mice normally lack a functional E gene product and are resistant to high doses of FV. The expression of H-2E molecules in H-2 recombinant or transgenic mice of this genotype resulted in a significant decrease in spontaneous recovery from FV-induced leukemia. In contrast, H-2E expression also appeared to influence recovery from Friend disease in a positive manner, since blocking these molecules with anti-E antibodies in vivo significantly decreased recovery from Friend disease. The data indicate that the positive effects of H-2E molecules derive from their function as restriction elements for helper T-cell recognition of the viral envelope glycoprotein, and we postulate that the negative effects are due to H-2E-dependent deletion in the T-cell repertoire during development.",,PMC236432,,,,,,,,,,,,

B9-11 cells responded only to human IL-11 and IL-6 and not to other human cytokines using the same gp130 transducer chain (ciliary neurotrophic factor, leukemia inhibitory factor and oncostatin M) or to other human interleukins (interleukin-1 to interleukin-13), human hematopoietic cytokines (granulocyte colony stimulating factor, granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor, colony stimulating factor-1) and various other human cytokines (interferon-alpha, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, tumor necrosis factor-beta, fibroblast growth factor and nerve growth factor). In addition, these cytokines did not interfere with the IL-11 response of B9-11 cells. IL-11-induced proliferation of B9-11 cells was unaffected by anti-murine IL-6 receptor mAb but inhibited by anti-gp130 mAb. Half-maximal proliferation of B9-11 cells was obtained with 30 pg/ml of recombinant IL-11, a concentration 300-fold lower than IL-11 concentrations known to be active on human cells. Finally, culturing of B9-11 cells with an anti-IL-6 mAb enabled us to measure the natural IL-11 produced by various cell lines. Thus, B9-11 cells should be useful for studies of IL-11 involvement in various human diseases as well as for a better understanding of the mechanisms of action of this cytokine.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ceramide has been suggested as an important mediator of the effect of TNF-alpha on growth inhibition, c-myc down-regulation, apoptosis, and the activation of the nuclear factor kappa B. Although there is no clearly defined intracellular target for ceramide activity, previous studies have demonstrated the existence of a ceramide-activated protein phosphatase (CAPP) in vitro. Since c-myc is an early downstream cellular target for TNF-alpha, we examined the role of ceramide and CAPP in c-myc down-regulation. In intact HL-60 cells ceramide induced down-regulation of c-myc RNA levels. C2-ceramide was active at 1-10 microM and caused 40-80% inhibition of c-myc RNA levels at 30-120 min of treatment. In nuclear run-on studies, C2-ceramide induced a block to transcription elongation of the c-myc transcript without affecting transcription through the first exon. Therefore, ceramide appeared to inhibit c-myc expression via a mechanism identical with that of TNF-alpha. HL-60 cells contained CAPP which was inhibited by okadaic acid (0.1-10 nm). CAPP in HL-60 cells was activated by D-erythro-ceramide but not D-erythro-dihydroceramide. The specificity of activation of CAPP by ceramide in vitro was matched by a similar specificity of c-myc down-regulation in cells. Moreover, okadaic acid inhibited the effects of ceramide and TNF-alpha on c-myc down-regulation. On the other hand, okadaic acid did not inhibit the ability of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate to down-regulate c-myc, demonstrating the existence of at least two distinct pathways in the regulation of c-myc expression.

There was also activation of the p53/56lyn and p72syk protein-tyrosine kinases, but compared to direct Fc epsilon RI activation, mAb AA4 did not result in increased tyrosine phosphorylation of pp105-115 or pp125FAK, and the receptor subunits (Fc epsilon RI beta and Fc epsilon RI gamma) were more heavily phosphorylated. Furthermore, the time course of the phosphorylations with mAb AA4 was slower than that induced by Fc epsilon RI aggregation. By immunofluorescence, the tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins after mAb AA4 stimulation were localized in patches at the cell membrane and in areas of cell-cell contact, whereas after Fc epsilon RI activation, there was a reticular cytoplasmic pattern. There were no protein tyrosine phosphorylations either when Fc epsilon RI was saturated with IgE or when F(ab')2 fragments of mAb AA4 were used, although the F(ab')2 fragments still induced morphological changes. There was also coprecipitation of the beta and gamma subunits of Fc epsilon RI with the anti-ganglioside antibody. These data strongly suggest the involvement of Fc epsilon RI in the antiganglioside-induced protein tyrosine phosphorylations.

A comparison between a variant supporting high mediator secretion (> 50%) and one with a 10-fold reduced response to antigen shows that the latter is associated with a defect in threonine and tyrosine phosphorylation of the subunits of the Fc epsilon R1 complex. The delayed onset and reduced mediator release in the low secretor facilitated a slow motion study of the early events following receptor activation. It showed that tyrosine phosphorylation of a 72-kDa protein is an early event preceding threonine and subsequent tyrosine phosphorylation of the gamma-chain. This points to the activation of both protein-tyrosine kinases and protein kinase(s) C as early events in signal transduction. The retarded onset and low intensity of phosphorylation in the low secreting variant is associated with reduced levels of inositol phosphate production, and this and the lack of the Ca2+ mobilization from intracellular stores indicate a defect upstream of teh activation of phospholipase C.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We found a 3-fold increase of 32PO4 incorporation into pp 21-2 in hexamethylene bisacetamide-treated parental MEL cells which was not secondary to an increase in pp 21-2 protein but appeared secondary to increased phosphorylation of pp 21-2 by A-kinase.

We used a granzyme B-specific mouse anti-human monoclonal antibody 2C5 and Western blotting to demonstrate that nuclear extracts of human interleukin-2-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells, the human NK leukemia cell line YT, and the rat NK leukemia cell line RNK-16 contain abundant granzyme B. In interleukin-2-activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells, more than 50% of the total cellular granzyme B was present in the nuclear lysate. Nuclear granzyme B had an apparent molecular mass of approximately 32 kDa in human cells and approximately 30 kDa in RNK-16 and was eluted from immobilized heparin at the same NaCl concentration as granzyme B from cytoplasmic granules. Granzyme B that was affinity-purified with 2C5 from the nuclei of YT or human LAK cells was capable of efficiently cleaving synthetic peptide thiobenzyl ester substrates with the same specificity (peptide cleavage after aspartic acid) as granule-localized granzyme B. By contrast perforin, which colocalizes with granzymes in cytotoxic granules, was not detectable in nuclear lysates. Granzyme B was also demonstrated to be present in the nucleus and cytoplasmic granules of YT by immunohistochemical staining with monospecific anti-granzyme B antisera. Other protease activities (tryptase and peptide cleavage after methionine) were also readily detectable in nuclear and cytoplasmic lysates of YT, RNK-16, and LAK cells, as determined by the cleavage of the synthetic substrates N alpha-benzyloxycarbonyl-L-lysine thiobenzyl ester (BLT) and Boc-Ala-Ala-Met-S-benzyl, except that BLT-esterase activity was absent from the nucleus of YT. The localization of serine proteases in the nucleus was restricted to lymphocytes with cytotoxic capacity, as non-cytotoxic cell lines expressed high levels of peptide cleavage after methionine and tryptase activities in their cytoplasm, but possessed no nuclear serine protease activity. Furthermore, non-cytotoxic monkey kidney COS-7 cells transfected with an SV40-driven expression plasmid incorporating full-length human granzyme B cDNA contained abundant cytoplasmic granzyme B, but demonstrated minimal nuclear granzyme B accumulation. We conclude that serine proteases of NK cells are not restricted to cytolytic granules and, further, that their capacity to access the nucleus may have implications for the role of these enzymes in eliciting target cell death.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They become activated upon antigen recognition by their T-cell receptors (TCR). The TCR repertoire is established by developmentally regulated TCR gene rearrangements and shaped by predominantly intrathymic selection processes. Failure of this system can lead to autoimmune disease. TCR gene probes and primers are widely used to distinguish polyclonal from abnormal clonal T-cell proliferations in Southern blot or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) procedures. T cells are normally activated by signal transduction through the TCR/CD3 complex and accessory molecules such as CD4 and CD8. Protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) and nuclear transcription factors (TFs) are important intracellular signaling molecules. Chromosomal abnormalities in T-cell leukemia often affect the gene loci of TFs, PTKs, and sometimes other growth regulatory proteins. Aberrant activation of these molecules may lead to alteration of the signaling cascade and interference with ordered T-cell development and differentiation. The increasing knowledge about different functional aspects of TCR physiology thus contributes to the diagnosis and understanding of reactive and malignant T-cell disorders. This will eventually lead to new diagnostic concepts and novel therapeutic strategies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The results showed that: (1) LAK cells could be induced from cord blood and the induced LAK cells could remarkably kill the tumor subculture cell lines including nature killer (NK)-sensitive K562 cells as well as NK-insensitive Raji cells; (2) The activity of cord blood LAK cells is higher than that of the LAK cells from gynecologic cancer patient's PBL, But no significant difference with that of the LAK cells from normal adult's PBL; (3) T+3, T+8, the OKT antigens of cord blood LAK cells are just the same as human LAK cells from other sources; (4) After a definite time co-incubation, the cord blood LAK cells and Raji cells could form atypical rosette-circles under light microscopy. In the field of transmission electron-microscopy, the cord blood LAK cells had a certain active mobility. Raji cells, when incubated with the cord LAK cells for 4 hours, would become apoptosis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RA did not provoke or aggravate DIC, it did not cause marrow hypoplasia or aplasia. The side effects were relatively mild as compared with chemotherapy. CFU-GM markedly reduced before treatment was restored to normal level after CR, while the result for L-CFU was reversed. In 40 cases examined for in vitro induction of differentiation, 39 responders were culminating in CR. Aberrant karyotype t (15; 17) was positive in all 47 cases examined prior to the treatment. It disappeared in all of the 20 cases studied after achieving CR, and reappeared in 3 cases following relapse.

This has been established both with mouse erythroleukaemia (MEL) cells and an ovarian cell line (A2780) which is known to contain wild-type p53. Other seleno-compounds, such as selenomethyl selenocysteine (SMS) and dimethyl selenoxide (DMS), which are potent chemopreventive agents and are known to be metabolized to methylated selenium derivatives directly rather than via SDG, are also growth inhibitory to both MEL and A2780 cells, although less so than SDG or selenite. However, cells growth-inhibited by DMS are more viable than cells growth-inhibited to the same extent by SDG or selenite, suggesting that the methylated seleno-compounds may inhibit cell growth in a different manner from that of SDG or selenite. Our studies of the mechanism of growth inhibition by SDG, have established two facts. First, SDG induces p53 protein levels in cells that contain wild-type p53 (A2780 cells), suggesting that SDG induces the DNA damage-recognition pathway. Secondly, SDG induces apoptosis in MEL cells, as judged by flow cytometry and formation of nucleosomal DNA ladders. However, since p53 mutations have been found to be targetted events in all MEL cells examined, our evidence suggests that induction of apoptosis by SDG is not absolutely dependent on the p53 response pathway.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using a new microperfusion assay, we integrated the peak plasma concentration (Cmax), the time of peak concentration (tmax), the absorption rate, and the elimination rate following methotrexate (MTX) treatment of L1210 leukemic cells in vitro. The effects of different MTX concentration courses with constant exposure doses (area under the concentration-time curve) were checked by combining the microperfusion assay with the clonogenic assay in agar-containing glass capillaries. We found that the concentration profiles obtained in the ultrafiltration-flat chamber (an essential part of the microperfusion system) can be described by the Bateman function. Thus, the flat chamber might be comprehended as a one-compartmental system with first-order absorption kinetics. We found that the colony-inhibition kinetics of L1210 cells obviously depended on the MTX exposure profile. Continuous cell-growth inhibition was obtained by one concentration profile that offered a compromise between all pharmacokinetic parameters. Our results correlated with the known pharmacodynamic activities of MTX and showed the relevance of different concentration courses to the cytotoxic effect of the drug. We suppose that the growth-inhibition kinetics of unknown, potential anticancer drugs can be also interpreted in similar ways.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All three compounds bind to and alkylate DNA at the N-3 position of adenine in a sequence-selective manner. Bizelesin is unique among the analogs with bifunctional alkylating capability due to two chloromethyl moieties that are converted to the cyclopropyl alkylating species that interact with DNA. A reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) assay and an L1210 cell bioassay were developed for bizelesin and subsequently applied to stability and murine pharmacokinetics studies. Following 48 h of incubation with L1210 cells the 50% growth-inhibitory concentrations (IC50) of bizelesin, adozelesin, and CC-1065 were 2.3, 3.4, and 88.1 pM, respectively.

Simultaneous treatment with heat (41.5 degrees C, 60 min) and cisplatin produced maximal cell killing with a 4-fold decrease in the 50% growth-inhibitory concentration (IC50) of the platinum complex. Super-additive cell killing was also shown when cells were exposed to heat before cisplatin treatment, whereas no thermal enhancement in cisplatin-mediated cytotoxicity was observed in cells given heat after exposure to cisplatin. These results correlated with the degree of formation of ISC observed in cells following various treatments. A 2- to 3-fold increase in ISC formation was observed in cells given heat before or during cisplatin exposure, whereas heat after cisplatin treatment did not alter either the formation or the reversal of ISC as compared with cisplatin alone. The increased ISC formation was associated with an increase in intracellular platinum accumulation and total platinum binding to DNA in cells given heat before or during cisplatin exposure. These data, showing that hyperthermia potentiates cisplatin cytotoxicity by increasing drug uptake and the formation of DNA adducts without inhibiting the repair of DNA lesions, demonstrate the potential utility of sequencing hyperthermia combined with cisplatin as a clinical anticancer therapy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 88:9248-9252, 1991). The results indicated that HBV may play some role in causing genomic instability during chronic hepatitis. In the present study, we showed that 15AB, a 60-base pair subgenomic fragment of HBV DNA (nucleotides 1855-1914) within C4BglII196 is indispensable for enhancement of in vitro recombination, using the mouse leukemia cell 70Z/3, as the cellular extract source. 15AB, thought to be the encapsidation signal of HBV pregenomic RNA and U5-like retrovirus long terminal repeat, was found to bind specifically to an approximately 100 kDa protein of 70Z/3 by southwestern blotting. Production of a mutation in the 15AB region decreased both its binding activity to 100 kDa protein and the in vitro recombination activity. Our present results thus suggest that 15AB might be a recombinogenic sequence and the 100-kDa protein may be a putative recombinogenic protein in eukaryotes, triggering genomic instability and facilitating carcinogenesis.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Moreover, N-ras mutations have been described in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in blast crisis but have not been observed during the chronic phase of the disease. In view of the morphological and clinical similarities between acute leukemia and the blast crisis of CML, the question was raised whether the presence of N-ras mutations is associated with the phenotype of acute leukemia. We investigated leukemic cells from 100 patients with CML for the presence of N-ras mutations in the mutational hot spot codons. The cases analyzed included 87 diagnosed with different types of blast crisis and 13 cases in accelerated or chronic phase of the disease. Fragments from N-ras exons I and II containing the codons of interest were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and analyzed for the presence of point mutations by three different technical approaches, including specific oligonucleotide hybridization, direct sequencing, and single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis. N-ras mutations were not detected in any of the CML patients investigated. Only one patient, in whom the initial diagnosis of CML-blast crisis had been revised to chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, displayed an N-ras mutation within codon 13. Our data strongly suggest that N-ras mutations do not play a role in myeloid or lymphoid blast crisis of CML.",['N-ras'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: This retrospective study reports 70 patients at various stages of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) infection who underwent stereotactic brain biopsy for an intracerebral space-occupying lesion. RESULTS: Of these patients, four had glial tumors: one astroblastoma, two astrocytomas, and one glioblastoma. Glial tumors probably arise from a complex interplay of factors; possibilities include the activation of a dominant oncogene or viral inactivation of a tumor suppressor gene by a viral promoter (like the tat protein), impairment of immune defenses (which facilitates the growth of astrocytomas in acute lymphoblastic leukemia), production of cellular growth factors, cytokines, possible infection of glial cells by HIV, and the potentiation of a coinfectious agent. CONCLUSIONS: These cases illustrate that glial tumors should be considered in the differential diagnosis of brain masses in HIV-1 infection, especially because specific treatment for these tumors is available. Moreover, the occurrence of glial tumors in AIDS patients is not only an important event from a clinical point of view, but may also have implications for the pathogenesis of tumors in AIDS.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is not active in any of the established tissue culture cell lines which we have analyzed. To search for transcriptional regulators within this promoter we have started to dissect the promoter into individual elements to determine their function. A DNA element which had previously been suggested to regulate transcription from DNA sequence analysis of the rat PPT promoter occurs at position -200 relative to the major start of transcription within the PPT promoter. The equivalent element from the bovine PPT promoter had previously been proposed to be a cAMP responsive element (CRE). The sequence of this enhancer has similarities with both the AP1 and CRE DNA consensus sequences. We have demonstrated that one copy of this rat PPT element linked to a heterologous basal promoter will enhance transcription in HeLa and PC12 cell lines as well as adult rat DRG neurons grown in culture. It is also demonstrated that the rat PPT element will bind proteins in HeLa nuclear extract distinct from those binding to the well-characterized Gibbon Ape Leukemia Virus (GALV) AP1 or somatostatin CRE sites by gel retardation analysis. This PPT element, when cloned in a heterologous reporter construct, although showing properties of both AP1 and CRE elements, was functionally distinguished from both the somatostatin CRE element and the GALV AP1 enhancer when these elements were tested in the same reporter construct. This PPT element has a constitutive level of activity in adult rat DRG neurons, which is fivefold higher than that driven by the reporter construct promoter. It is also significantly different from the same reporter construct linked to the somatostatin CRE and analyzed in DRG neurons.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, we review the use of ""newer"" drugs (epipodophyllotoxins), which may be effective but are also associated with high morbidity (ie, secondary acute myeloid leukemia). As a second issue, ""dose intensity"" and the use of high-dose chemotherapy followed by bone marrow transplantation will be challenged, especially in light of peripheral stem cell harvest and the use of growth factors.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
