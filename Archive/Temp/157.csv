Two classes of Flt3 mutations occur: internal tandem duplications (ITDs) in the juxtamembrane and point mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain (TKD). We and others have shown that Flt3-ITD induced aberrant signaling including strong activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) and repression of CCAAT/estradiol-binding protein alpha (c/EBPalpha) and Pu.1. Here, we compared the signaling properties of Flt3-ITD versus Flt3-TKD in myeloid progenitor cells. We demonstrate that Flt3-TKD mutations induced autonomous growth of 32D cells in suspension cultures. However, in contrast to Flt3-ITD and similar to wild-type Flt3 (Flt3-WT), Flt3-TKD cannot support colony formation in semisolid media. Also, in contrast to Flt3-ITD, neither Flt3-WT nor Flt3-TKD induced activation or induction of STAT5 target genes. Flt3-TKD also failed to repress c/EBPalpha and Pu.1. No significant differences were observed in receptor autophosphorylation and the phosphorylation of Erk-1 and -2, Akt, and Shc. Importantly, TKD but not ITD mutations were a log power more sensitive toward the tyrosine kinase inhibitor protein kinase C 412 (PKC412) than Flt3-WT. In conclusion, Flt3-ITD and Flt3-TKD mutations display differences in their signaling properties that could have important implications for their transforming capacity and for the design of mutation-specific therapeutic approaches.","['Choudhary, Chunaram', 'Schwable, Joachim', 'Brandts, Christian', 'Tickenbrock, Lara', 'Sargin, Bulent', 'Kindler, Thomas', 'Fischer, Thomas', 'Berdel, Wolfgang E', 'Muller-Tidow, Carsten', 'Serve, Hubert']","['Choudhary C', 'Schwable J', 'Brandts C', 'Tickenbrock L', 'Sargin B', 'Kindler T', 'Fischer T', 'Berdel WE', 'Muller-Tidow C', 'Serve H']","['Department of Medicine, Hematology/Oncology and Interdisciplinary Center for Clinical Research, University Munster, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20050315,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Milk Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (protein kinase modulator)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)', 'ID912S5VON (midostaurin)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/physiology/radiation effects', 'Cell Line', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism', 'Milk Proteins/metabolism', 'Muridae', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Myeloid Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Point Mutation', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/chemistry/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/chemistry/*genetics/*metabolism', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'Staurosporine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Tandem Repeat Sequences', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3']",2005/03/17 09:00,2005/08/02 09:00,['2005/03/17 09:00'],"['2005/03/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/02 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)53352-1 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2004-07-2942 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2005 Jul 1;106(1):265-73. doi: 10.1182/blood-2004-07-2942.

Proteomics studies can provide a wealth of information and rapidly generate large quantities of data from the analysis of biological specimens. The high dimensionality of data generated from these studies requires the development of improved bioinformatics tools for efficient and accurate data analyses. For proteome profiling of a particular system or organism, a number of specialized software tools are needed. Indeed, significant advances in the informatics and software tools necessary to support the analysis and management of these massive amounts of data are needed. Clustering algorithms based on probabilistic and Bayesian models provide an alternative to heuristic algorithms. The number of clusters (diseased and non-diseased groups) is reduced to the choice of the number of components of a mixture of underlying probability. The Bayesian approach is a tool for including information from the data to the analysis. It offers an estimation of the uncertainties of the data and the parameters involved. RESULTS: We present novel algorithms that can organize, cluster and derive meaningful patterns of expression from large-scaled proteomics experiments. We processed raw data using a graphical-based algorithm by transforming it from a real space data-expression to a complex space data-expression using discrete Fourier transformation; then we used a thresholding approach to denoise and reduce the length of each spectrum. Bayesian clustering was applied to the reconstructed data. In comparison with several other algorithms used in this study including K-means, (Kohonen self-organizing map (SOM), and linear discriminant analysis, the Bayesian-Fourier model-based approach displayed superior performances consistently, in selecting the correct model and the number of clusters, thus providing a novel approach for accurate diagnosis of the disease. Using this approach, we were able to successfully denoise proteomic spectra and reach up to a 99% total reduction of the number of peaks compared to the original data. In addition, the Bayesian-based approach generated a better classification rate in comparison with other classification algorithms. This new finding will allow us to apply the Fourier transformation for the selection of the protein profile for each sample, and to develop a novel bioinformatic strategy based on Bayesian clustering for biomarker discovery and optimal diagnosis.","['Bensmail, Halima', 'Golek, Jennifer', 'Moody, Michelle M', 'Semmes, John O', 'Haoudi, Abdelali']","['Bensmail H', 'Golek J', 'Moody MM', 'Semmes JO', 'Haoudi A']","['Department of Statistics, University of Tennessee, 334 Stokely Management Building, Knoxville, TN 37996-0532, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Validation Study']",20050315,England,Bioinformatics,"Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)",9808944,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Proteome)']",IM,"['Algorithms', 'Bayes Theorem', 'Biomarkers/blood', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Databases, Protein', 'Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted/methods', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Fourier Analysis', 'Gene Expression Profiling/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*blood/*diagnosis', 'Paraparesis, Tropical Spastic/*blood/*diagnosis', 'Pattern Recognition, Automated/*methods', 'Proteome/*analysis/metabolism', 'Sequence Analysis, Protein/methods', 'Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization/methods']",2005/03/17 09:00,2005/09/01 09:00,['2005/03/17 09:00'],"['2005/03/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/01 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['bti383 [pii]', '10.1093/bioinformatics/bti383 [doi]']",ppublish,Bioinformatics. 2005 May 15;21(10):2210-24. doi: 10.1093/bioinformatics/bti383.

The majority of exposure data result from film badge monitoring programmes at the four US weapons production facilities and a US Naval shipyard. Bias and uncertainty in reported exposures among study facilities and across time were as result of differences in incident photon energy, exposure geometry, dosemeter type and dosimetry methods. These sources of measurement uncertainty were examined by facility and time to derive bias factors (B) for normalising exposures. In conjunction with facility reported results, the bias factors provide a means to estimate the equivalent dose, penetrating to a depth of 10 mm [H(p)(10)] and the equivalent dose to the active bone marrow for use in the epidemiological study. Uncertainty was expressed as the constructed 95% confidence interval (i.e. the 2.5th-97.5th% range) of the estimated parameter. The bias factors indicate that recorded exposures provide a reasonable estimate of H(p)(10) (bias factor near unity) and overestimate equivalent dose to active bone marrow (H(T)) by a factor between 1.2 and 1.7. On average, dosemeter-response uncertainties estimated using Monte Carlo simulation were approximately +/-19 and +/-33% for H(p)(10) and H(T), respectively.","['Daniels, R D', 'Schubauer-Berigan, M K']","['Daniels RD', 'Schubauer-Berigan MK']","['Division of Surveillance, Hazard Evaluations, and Field Studies (DSHEFS), National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), 555 Ridge Avenue, R-44, Cincinnati, OH 45213, USA.

Similar to other CD33-related siglecs, Siglec-5 contains two tyrosine-based motifs in its cytoplasmic tail implicated in signaling functions. To investigate the role of these motifs in Siglec-5-dependent signaling, we used transfected rat basophil leukemia cells as a model system. Tyrosine phosphorylation of Siglec-5 led to recruitment of the tyrosine phosphatases SHP-1 and SHP-2, as seen in both pull-down assays and microscopy. Siglec-5 could efficiently inhibit FcepsilonRI-mediated calcium fluxing and serotonin release after co-cross-linking. Surprisingly, a double tyrosine to alanine mutant of Siglec-5 could still mediate strong inhibition of serotonin release in the absence of detectable tyrosine phosphorylation, whereas a double tyrosine to phenylalanine mutant lost all inhibitory activity. In comparison, suppression of Siglec-5-dependent adhesion to red blood cells was reversed by either tyrosine to alanine or tyrosine to phenylalanine mutations of the membrane proximal tyrosine-based motif. Using an in vitro phosphatase assay with synthetic and recombinant forms of the cytoplasmic tail, it was shown that a double alanine mutant of Siglec-5 had weak, but significant SHP-1 activating properties similar to those of wild type, non-phosphorylated cytoplasmic tail, whereas a double phenylalanine mutant was inactive. These findings establish that Siglec-5 can be classified as an inhibitory receptor with the potential to mediate SHP-1 and/or SHP-2-dependent signaling in the absence of tyrosine phosphorylation.","['Avril, Tony', 'Freeman, Sylvie D', 'Attrill, Helen', 'Clarke, Rosemary G', 'Crocker, Paul R']","['Avril T', 'Freeman SD', 'Attrill H', 'Clarke RG', 'Crocker PR']","['Division of Cell Biology and Immunology, The Wellcome Trust Biocentre, School of Life Sciences, University of Dundee, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20050315,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Lectins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (SIGLEC5 protein, human)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (PTPN11 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (PTPN6 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 6)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Ptpn11 protein, rat)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Ptpn6 protein, rat)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Motifs', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Adhesion/physiology', 'Cell Line', 'DNA/genetics', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Lectins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 6', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases/genetics/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transfection', 'Tyrosine/chemistry']",2005/03/17 09:00,2005/07/09 09:00,['2005/03/17 09:00'],"['2005/03/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/09 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(20)61770-7 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M502041200 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2005 May 20;280(20):19843-51. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M502041200.

However, with our increasing knowledge of gene regulation, it is becoming obvious that changes in nucleotide sequence are not the sole mechanism for eliciting changes in transcription. An additional layer of regulation of gene expression, called epigenetics, is now being realized as increasingly important in oncogenesis. Epigenetics is defined as non-sequence based changes in chromatin that elicit changes in gene expression that are propagated through mitosis and/or meiosis. The alleles of the genes containing these epigenetic marks are termed epialleles. Epigenetics has been linked to cancer since 1983 by the work of Andy Feinberg and Bert Vogelstein, but has largely remained in the shadows. These changes in chromatin are now at the forefront of research in the field of oncogenesis, both as mechanisms of oncogenesis and as prognostic indicators of cancer risk. Leukemia, due to the defects in cellular differentiation associated with the disease, has important connections to epigenetic gene regulation. Cellular differentiation has been studied as a model system for epigenetic gene control in Drosophila. Homeobox genes in the antennapedia and bithorax gene clusters have long been known to be regulated by trithorax group and Polycomb group of genes, which regulate transcription through chromatin remodeling mechanisms. The ectopic expression of the mammalian homologs of the homeobox genes has been linked to leukemic transformation since 1988, and has continued to show extensive connections. These connections that leukemia has with cellular differentiation make this group of diseases amenable to exploring the mechanisms of epigenetic gene regulation as they pertain to oncogenesis. This review will examine leukemia, with an emphasis on myelogenous leukemia, as a defect in cellular differentiation and examine possibilities of epigenetic gene regulation of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes.","['Sollars, Vincent E']",['Sollars VE'],"['Department of Microbiology, Immunology, and Molecular Genetics, Joan C.

However, the potential role that IL-2Ralpha plays in tumorigenesis is still not fully elucidated.

RESULTS: (1) CD(34) and CD(133) expression in AL patients was significantly higher than that in controls (46.37% vs 0.47%, 21.93% vs 0.29%, P < 0.01), but there was no obvious difference of CD(90) expression between them (0.51% vs 0.25%, P > 0.05). The expression of CD(133) antigen was highly correlated with CD(133) mRNA expression in both of the normal control donors and AL patients (r = 0.932, P < 0.01). (2) The positive rates of CD(34), CD(90) and CD(133) in all AL patients were 63.2%, 7.9% and 42.1%, respectively. The expression of CD(90) in ALL was higher than that in AML (P < 0.05).

(3) CD(133) expression in AML was significantly correlated with the expression of CD(34) and HLA-DR (P < 0.01). (4) The expression of CD(34), CD(90) and CD(133) was not associated with the clinical prognostic factors such as cytogenetic or molecular aberrations, initial peripheral blood WBC counts, lactate dehydrogenase level, multiple drug resistant expression and age.

Some manifestations result from ocular-orbital involvement, which usually occurs through the central nervous system. Other manifestations stem from vasculopathy and/or hemorheologic disorders (anemia, thrombocytopenia, hyperviscosity). OBSERVATION: We report a case of a 42-year-old women presenting with loss of vision caused by serous macular detachment. The investigations showed the diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Steroids and chemotherapy led to complete remission with normal visual acuity during a follow-up of 29 months. DISCUSSION: Ocular involvement is seen in 28%-80% of leukemia cases. The most obvious findings are the presence of retinal hemorrhages, which are most commonly located in the posterior pole. The intraretinal hemorrhage may contain a white component that usually is a white dot in the center of the hemorrhage, but other clinical features are described. Serous detachment of the neuroepithelium is seldom reported, and can be the first symptom of the disease. Other ocular findings include infiltrative involvement of the chorioretina, anterior segment involvement, and orbital location. Ocular location is estimated to be an equivalent of central nervous system involvement, and subsequently requires adequate treatment (steroids, chemotherapy and radiotherapy of the central nervous system). CONCLUSION: Ocular manifestations of leukemia are frequent but rarely reveal the disease. Serous detachment is rarer. However, the diagnosis of leukemia should be considered in case of pigmentary epithelium involvement.","['Abdallah, E', 'Hajji, Z', 'Mellal, Z', 'Belmekki, M', 'Bencherifa, F', 'Berraho, A']","['Abdallah E', 'Hajji Z', 'Mellal Z', 'Belmekki M', 'Bencherifa F', 'Berraho A']","['Service Ophtalmologie B, France. habdallah@menara.ma']",['fre'],"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,France,J Fr Ophtalmol,Journal francais d'ophtalmologie,7804128,,IM,"['Adult', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications/*diagnosis', 'Retinal Detachment/*etiology']",2005/03/16 09:00,2005/10/27 09:00,['2005/03/16 09:00'],"['2005/03/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/10/27 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0181-5512(05)81023-X [pii]', '10.1016/s0181-5512(05)81023-x [doi]']",ppublish,J Fr Ophtalmol. 2005 Jan;28(1):39-44. doi: 10.1016/s0181-5512(05)81023-x.,,,Decollement sereux maculaire revelateur d'une leucemie aigue lymphoblastique.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, histologic examination is important in HCL but often difficult in cases with low numbers of tumor cells. A combined immunohistochemical positivity for DBA.44 and tartrate-resistant phosphatase was previously found in 100% of HCL and suggested to be specific for this diagnosis. To further assess the diagnostic specificity and sensitivity of this immunohistochemical approach in a higher number of cases, we analyzed 56 HCLs and lymphoma tissue microarrays, including 840 cases of the most frequent non-Hodgkin lymphomas. All HCLs showed combined positivity for these two proteins (100% sensitivity). Both antibodies were often positive in other lymphoma types. DBA.44 reactivity was especially frequent in follicular lymphomas (46%), whereas tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) expression was often seen in mantle cell lymphomas (57%), primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphomas (54%), and chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (41%). A combined DBA.44/TRAP positivity was seen in only 3% of non-HCL non-Hodgkin lymphomas, including cases of diffuse large B-cell lymphomas, follicular lymphomas, chronic lymphatic leukemia/small lymphocytic leukemias, and mantle cell lymphomas. Overall, these data confirm the utility of combined immunohistochemical DBA.44/TRAP expression analysis in confirming the diagnosis of HCL.

The detection of multiple metastatic peri-pancreatic nodes by EUS-FNA may dissuade the surgeon from undertaking a curative pancreatic resection. CASE REPORT: We report an interesting case of a man with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, who presented with the diagnostic problem of a pancreatic solid-cystic lesion and multiple malignant-looking peri-pancreatic lymphadenopathy on EUS. EUS-FNA yielded chronic lymphocytic leukaemia involvement in the peri-pancreatic lymph nodes and a markedly elevated CEA in the cystic fluid. The absence of adenocarcinoma involvement of the lymph nodes prompted surgery on the pancreatic lesion with a curative intent. Pancreatic mucinous cystadenocarcinoma was diagnosed and a sub-total pancreatectomy was performed with clear resection margins. All 30 resected peri-pancreatic lymph nodes showed chronic lymphocytic leukemia involvement only. CONCLUSIONS: This case illustrates that abnormal lymphadenopathy adjacent to a primary pancreatic lesion may not necessarily be due to the latter. Systemic lymphoproliferative disease, as in this case, can masquerade as metastatic adenocarcinoma lymph nodes on EUS. EUS-FNA is useful in diagnosing lymphoproliferative disease.","['Vu, Charles K F', 'Chang, Fuju', 'Doig, Laura', 'Meenan, John']","['Vu CK', 'Chang F', 'Doig L', 'Meenan J']","[""Department of Gastroenterology, Guy's and St Thomas' Hospitals, London, United Kingdom.""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20050310,Italy,JOP,JOP : Journal of the pancreas,101091810,,IM,"['Aged', 'Cystadenocarcinoma/complications/*diagnosis/*secondary/surgery', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Endosonography', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/complications/diagnosis/diagnostic imaging', 'Lymph Nodes/diagnostic imaging/pathology/surgery', 'Lymphatic Metastasis/*diagnosis/diagnostic imaging/pathology', 'Male', 'Pancreas/diagnostic imaging/pathology/surgery', 'Pancreatectomy', 'Pancreatic Neoplasms/complications/*diagnosis/surgery']",2005/03/16 09:00,2006/04/29 09:00,['2005/03/16 09:00'],"['2005/03/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/29 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/16 09:00 [entrez]']",['v06i02a11 [pii]'],epublish,JOP. 2005 Mar 10;6(2):189-93.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We previously reported that the PU.1 promoter cannot induce expression of a reporter gene in vivo, and cell-type-specific expression of PU.1 in stable lines was conferred by a 3.4-kb DNA fragment including a DNase I hypersensitive site located 14 kb upstream of the transcription start site. Here we demonstrate that this kb -14 site confers lineage-specific reporter gene expression in vivo. This kb -14 upstream regulatory element contains two 300-bp regions which are highly conserved in five mammalian species. In Friend virus-induced erythroleukemia, the spleen focus-forming virus integrates into the PU.1 locus between these two conserved regions. DNA binding experiments demonstrated that PU.1 itself and Elf-1 bind to a highly conserved site within the proximal homologous region in vivo. A mutation of this site abolishing binding of PU.1 and Elf-1 led to a marked decrease in the ability of this upstream element to direct activity of reporter gene in myelomonocytic cell lines. These data suggest that a potential positive autoregulatory loop mediated through an upstream regulatory element is essential for proper PU.1 gene expression.","['Okuno, Yutaka', 'Huang, Gang', 'Rosenbauer, Frank', 'Evans, Erica K', 'Radomska, Hanna S', 'Iwasaki, Hiromi', 'Akashi, Koichi', 'Moreau-Gachelin, Francoise', 'Li, Youlin', 'Zhang, Pu', 'Gottgens, Berthold', 'Tenen, Daniel G']","['Okuno Y', 'Huang G', 'Rosenbauer F', 'Evans EK', 'Radomska HS', 'Iwasaki H', 'Akashi K', 'Moreau-Gachelin F', 'Li Y', 'Zhang P', 'Gottgens B', 'Tenen DG']","['Harvard Institutes of Medicine, Room 954, 77 Ave. Louis Pasteur, Boston, MA 02115, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (proto-oncogene protein Spi-1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Lineage', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Myeloid Cells/metabolism', 'Organ Specificity', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Response Elements/*genetics', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Trans-Activators/*genetics/*metabolism']",2005/03/16 09:00,2005/04/20 09:00,['2005/03/16 09:00'],"['2005/03/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/20 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['25/7/2832 [pii]', '10.1128/MCB.25.7.2832-2845.2005 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2005 Apr;25(7):2832-45. doi: 10.1128/MCB.25.7.2832-2845.2005.,,,,"['K01 DK062064/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA041456/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA41456/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK62064/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",PMC1061634,,,,,,,,,,,,

The hallmarks of ALT in telomerase-negative cancer cells include a unique pattern of telomere length heterogeneity, rapid changes in individual telomere lengths, and the presence of ALT-associated promyelocytic leukemia bodies (APBs) containing telomeric DNA and proteins involved in telomere binding, DNA replication, and recombination. The ALT mechanism appears to involve recombination-mediated DNA replication, but the molecular details are largely unknown. In telomerase-null Saccharomyces cerevisiae, an analogous survivor mechanism is dependent on the RAD50 gene. We demonstrate here that overexpression of Sp100, a constituent of promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies, sequestered the MRE11, RAD50, and NBS1 recombination proteins away from APBs. This resulted in repression of the ALT mechanism, as evidenced by progressive telomere shortening at 121 bp per population doubling, a rate within the range found in telomerase-negative normal cells, suppression of rapid telomere length changes, and suppression of APB formation. Spontaneously generated C-terminally truncated Sp100 that did not sequester the MRE11, RAD50, and NBS1 proteins failed to inhibit ALT. These findings identify for the first time proteins that are required for the ALT mechanism.","['Jiang, Wei-Qin', 'Zhong, Ze-Huai', 'Henson, Jeremy D', 'Neumann, Axel A', 'Chang, Andy C-M', 'Reddel, Roger R']","['Jiang WQ', 'Zhong ZH', 'Henson JD', 'Neumann AA', 'Chang AC', 'Reddel RR']","[""Children's Medical Research Institute, 214 Hawkesbury Rd., Westmead, NSW 2145, Australia.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'Telomere/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transgenes/genetics']",2005/03/16 09:00,2005/04/20 09:00,['2005/03/16 09:00'],"['2005/03/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/20 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['25/7/2708 [pii]', '10.1128/MCB.25.7.2708-2721.2005 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2005 Apr;25(7):2708-21. doi: 10.1128/MCB.25.7.2708-2721.2005.,,,,,PMC1061646,['Mol Cell Biol. 2005 May;25(10):4334'],,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred seventy-seven previously treated patients with CLL were evaluated. Treatment consisted of rituximab 375 mg/m(2) day 1 of course 1 and 500 mg/m(2) day 1 of courses 2 to 6; fludarabine 25 mg/m(2)/d days 2 to 4 of course 1 and days 1 to 3 of courses 2 to 6; and cyclophosphamide 250 mg/m(2)/d days 2 to 4 of course 1 and days 1 to 3 of courses 2 to 6. Courses were repeated every 4 weeks. RESULTS: CR was achieved in 25% of 177 patients, and nodular partial remission and partial remission were achieved in 16% and 32% of patients, respectively; the overall response rate was 73%. Twelve (32%) of 37 complete responders tested achieved molecular remission in bone marrow. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to identify pretreatment patient characteristics associated with CR and overall remission, longer time to progression, and overall survival. CONCLUSION: The FCR regimen was an active and well-tolerated treatment for previously treated patients with CLL. Myelosuppression was the most common toxicity. FCR induced the highest CR rate reported in a clinical trial of previously treated patients with CLL. Furthermore, molecular remissions were achieved in a third of patients achieving CR.","['Wierda, William', ""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Wen, Sijin', 'Faderl, Stefan', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Thomas, Deborah', 'Do, Kim-Anh', 'Cortes, Jorge', 'Koller, Charles', 'Beran, Miloslav', 'Ferrajoli, Alessandra', 'Giles, Francis', 'Lerner, Susan', 'Albitar, Maher', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Keating, Michael']","['Wierda W', ""O'Brien S"", 'Wen S', 'Faderl S', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Thomas D', 'Do KA', 'Cortes J', 'Koller C', 'Beran M', 'Ferrajoli A', 'Giles F', 'Lerner S', 'Albitar M', 'Kantarjian H', 'Keating M']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Blvd, Unit 428, Houston, TX 77030, USA. wwierda@mdanderson.org']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20050314,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/administration & dosage', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Chi-Square Distribution', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Rituximab', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives']",2005/03/16 09:00,2005/08/05 09:00,['2005/03/16 09:00'],"['2005/03/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/05 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['JCO.2005.12.516 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2005.12.516 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2005 Jun 20;23(18):4070-8. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2005.12.516.

High-dose chemotherapy with stem-cell support produced promising results in initial clinical trials conducted at single institutions. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Seven hundred eighty-five women aged 22 to 66 years with stage IIA, IIB, or IIIA breast cancer involving 10 or more axillary lymph nodes were randomized after surgery and standard adjuvant chemotherapy to either high-dose cyclophosphamide, cisplatin, and carmustine (HD-CPB) with stem-cell support or intermediate-dose cyclophosphamide, cisplatin, and carmustine (ID-CPB) with G-CSF support but without stem cells. Planned treatment for all patients included locoregional radiation therapy. Hormone-receptor-positive patients were to receive 5 years of tamoxifen. Event-free survival (EFS) was the primary end point. RESULTS: Median follow-up was 7.3 years. Event-free survival was not significantly different between the two treatment groups (P = .24). The probability of being free of an event at 5 years with HD-CPB was 61% (95% CI, 56% to 65%), and was 58% (95% CI, 53% to 63%) for ID-CPB. Thirty-three patients died of causes attributed to HD-CPB, compared with no therapy-related deaths among women treated with ID-CPB. Overall survival for the two arms was identical at 71% at 5 years (P = .75).

Treatment of U937 monocytic leukemia cells with rapamycin (10 nmol/L) in conjunction with a minimally toxic concentration of UCN-01 (100 nmol/L) for 36 hours resulted in marked potentiation of mitochondrial injury (i.e., loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and cytosolic release of cytochrome c, AIF, and Smac/DIABLO), caspase activation, and apoptosis. The release of cytochrome c, AIF, and Smac/DIABLO were inhibited by BOC-D-fmk, indicating that their release was caspase dependent. These events were associated with marked down-regulation of Raf-1, MEK, and ERK phosphorylation, diminished Akt activation, and enhanced phosphorylation of c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK). Coadministration of UCN-01 and rapamycin reduced the expression levels of the antiapoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL and diminished the expression of cyclin D1 and p34(cdc2). Furthermore, enforced expression of a constitutively active MEK1 or, to a lesser extent, myristoylated Akt construct partially but significantly attenuated UCN-01/rapamycin-mediated lethality in both U937 and Jurkat cell systems. Finally, inhibition of the stress-related JNK by SP600125 or by the expression of a dominant-negative mutant of c-Jun significantly attenuated apoptosis induced by rapamycin/UCN-01. Together, these findings indicate that the mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor potentiates UCN-01 cytotoxicity in a variety of human leukemia cell types and suggest that inhibition of both Raf-1/MEK/ERK and Akt cytoprotective signaling pathways as well as JNK activation contribute to this phenomenon.","['Hahn, Michael', 'Li, Weiqun', 'Yu, Chunrong', 'Rahmani, Mohamed', 'Dent, Paul', 'Grant, Steven']","['Hahn M', 'Li W', 'Yu C', 'Rahmani M', 'Dent P', 'Grant S']","['Department of Medicine, MCV Station Box 230, Virginia Commonwealth University, Medical College of Virginia, Richmond, VA 23298, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)', '7BU5H4V94A (7-hydroxystaurosporine)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (AKT1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDC2 Protein Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 4)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)', 'W36ZG6FT64 (Sirolimus)']",IM,"['Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'CDC2 Protein Kinase/metabolism', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclin D1/metabolism', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Down-Regulation', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/*metabolism', 'Genes, Dominant', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 1/*metabolism', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 4', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sirolimus/*pharmacology', 'Staurosporine/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Time Factors', 'U937 Cells']",2005/03/16 09:00,2005/06/29 09:00,['2005/03/16 09:00'],"['2005/03/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/29 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['4/3/457 [pii]', '10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-04-0137 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2005 Mar;4(3):457-70. doi: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-04-0137.,,,,"['CA 100866/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 93738/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA63753/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Morphologic and DNA fragmentation assays indicated that the cytotoxic effect of boswellic acid acetate was mediated by induction of apoptosis. More than 50% of the cells underwent apoptosis after treatment with 20 mug/mL boswellic acid for 24 hours. This apoptotic process was p53 independent. The levels of apoptosis-related proteins Bcl-2, Bax, and Bcl-XL were not modulated by boswellic acid acetate. Boswellic acid acetate induced Bid cleavage and decreased mitochondrial membrane potential without production of hydrogen peroxide. A general caspase inhibitor (Z-VAD-FMK) and a specific caspase-8 inhibitor II (Z-IETD-FMK) blocked boswellic acid acetate-induced apoptosis. The mRNAs of death receptors 4 and 5 (DR4 and DR5) were induced in leukemia cells undergoing apoptosis after boswellic acid acetate treatment. These data taken together suggest that boswellic acid acetate induces myeloid leukemia cell apoptosis through activation of caspase-8 by induced expression of DR4 and DR5, and that the activated caspase-8 either directly activates caspase-3 by cleavage or indirectly by cleaving Bid, which in turn decreases mitochondria membrane potential.","['Xia, Lijuan', 'Chen, Duo', 'Han, Rui', 'Fang, Qicheng', 'Waxman, Samuel', 'Jing, Yongkui']","['Xia L', 'Chen D', 'Han R', 'Fang Q', 'Waxman S', 'Jing Y']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, Box 1178, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, One Gustave L.

We investigated the functional role of the glycine-rich segment, Met-326 to Ser-337, of the human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) TM, gp21, by alanine and proline scanning mutagenesis. Alanine substitution for the hydrophobic residue Ile-334 caused an approximately 90% reduction in cell-cell fusion activity without detectable effects on the lipid-mixing and pore formation phases of fusion. Alanine substitutions at other positions had smaller effects (Gly-329, Val-330, and Gly-332) or no effect on fusion function. Proline substitution for glycine residues inhibited cell-cell fusion function with position-dependent effects on the three phases of fusion.

Our lab has recently demonstrated that a novel immunodominant cytotoxic-T-lymphocyte (CTL) epitope (SYNTGRFPPL) is expressed from a +1-nucleotide translational open reading frame of BM5def during the course of normal retrovirus expression. The SYNTGRFPPL CTL epitope may be generated from either of two initiation methionines present, ORF2a or ORF2b, located downstream of the ORF1 initiation site. This study investigates the role(s) of the alternative ORF2-derived gag protein(s) of BM5def in viral pathogenesis. We have examined the disease-inducing capabilities of mutant viruses in which the translational potential of either the initiating ORF2a or ORF2b AUG has been disrupted. Although these mutated viruses are capable of wild-type ORF1 expression, they are unable to induce disease. Our data strongly suggest the existence of a novel ORF2 product(s) that is required for LP-BM5-induced pathogenesis and have potentially broad implications for other retroviral diseases.","['Gaur, Arti', 'Green, William R']","['Gaur A', 'Green WR']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Norris Cancer Center, Dartmouth Medical School, Lebanon, NH 03756, USA.

This study is focused on the PDZ protein TIP-2/GIPC, which was originally identified in two-hybrid screens performed with two different baits: the human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 Tax oncoprotein and the regulator of G signaling RGS-GAIP. Further studies have shown that TIP-2/GIPC is also able to associate with the cytoplasmic domains of various transmembrane proteins. In this report we show that TIP-2/GIPC interacts with the E6 protein of human papillomavirus type 18 (HPV-18). This event triggers polyubiquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation of the cellular protein. In agreement with this observation, silencing of E6 by RNA interference in HeLa cells causes an increase in the intracellular TIP-2/GIPC level. This PDZ protein has been previously found to be involved in transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) signaling by favoring expression of the TGF-beta type III receptor at the cell membrane. In line with this activity of TIP-2/GIPC, we observed that depletion of this protein in HeLa cells hampers induction of the Id3 gene by TGF-beta treatment and also diminishes the antiproliferative effect of this cytokine. Conversely, silencing of E6 increases the expression of Id3 and blocks proliferation of HeLa cells. These results support the notion that HPV-18 E6 renders cells less sensitive to the cytostatic effect of TGF-beta by lowering the intracellular amount of TIP-2/GIPC.","['Favre-Bonvin, Arnaud', 'Reynaud, Caroline', 'Kretz-Remy, Carole', 'Jalinot, Pierre']","['Favre-Bonvin A', 'Reynaud C', 'Kretz-Remy C', 'Jalinot P']","['Laboratoire de Biologie Moleculaire de la Cellule, CNRS UMR 5161, Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon, Lyon, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (E6 protein, Human papillomavirus type 18)', '0 (GIPC1 protein, human)', '0 (Neuropeptides)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Viral)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '0 (Ubiquitin)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Animals', 'COS Cells', 'Carrier Proteins/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Gene Silencing', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Neuropeptides/*metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Viral/*metabolism', 'Papillomaviridae/*metabolism', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', '*Protein Interaction Mapping', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering', '*Signal Transduction', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Ubiquitin/metabolism']",2005/03/16 09:00,2005/04/27 09:00,['2005/03/16 09:00'],"['2005/03/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/27 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['79/7/4229 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.79.7.4229-4237.2005 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2005 Apr;79(7):4229-37. doi: 10.1128/JVI.79.7.4229-4237.2005.,,,,,PMC1061528,,,,,,,,,,,,

This position was previously found to be one of the most critical in determining the substrate specificity differences of retroviral proteases. Specificities at this position were compared for HIV-1, HIV-2, equine infectious anemia virus, avian myeloblastosis virus, Mason-Pfizer monkey virus, mouse mammary tumor virus, Moloney murine leukemia virus, human T-cell leukemia virus type 1, bovine leukemia virus, human foamy virus, and walleye dermal sarcoma virus proteases. Three types of P2 preferences were observed: a subgroup of proteases preferred small hydrophobic side chains (Ala and Cys), and another subgroup preferred large hydrophobic residues (Ile and Leu), while the protease of HIV-1 preferred an Asn residue. The specificity distinctions among the proteases correlated well with the phylogenetic tree of retroviruses prepared solely based on the protease sequences. Molecular models for all of the proteases studied were built, and they were used to interpret the results. While size complementarities appear to be the main specificity-determining features of the S2 subsite of retroviral proteases, electrostatic contributions may play a role only in the case of HIV proteases. In most cases the P2 residues of naturally occurring type 1 cleavage site sequences of the studied proteases agreed well with the observed P2 preferences.","['Bagossi, Peter', 'Sperka, Tamas', 'Feher, Anita', 'Kadas, Janos', 'Zahuczky, Gabor', 'Miklossy, Gabriella', 'Boross, Peter', 'Tozser, Jozsef']","['Bagossi P', 'Sperka T', 'Feher A', 'Kadas J', 'Zahuczky G', 'Miklossy G', 'Boross P', 'Tozser J']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Research Center for Molecular Medicine, Medical and Health Science Center, University of Debrecen, Debrecen, Hungary.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Oligopeptides)', 'EC 3.4.- (Peptide Hydrolases)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Avian Myeloblastosis Virus/enzymology', 'Binding Sites', 'Conserved Sequence', 'Epsilonretrovirus/enzymology', 'HIV-1/enzymology', 'HIV-2/enzymology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/enzymology', 'Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions', 'Infectious Anemia Virus, Equine/enzymology', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/enzymology', 'Mammary Tumor Virus, Mouse/enzymology', 'Mason-Pfizer monkey virus/enzymology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/enzymology', 'Oligopeptides/*metabolism', 'Peptide Hydrolases/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Phylogeny', 'Retroviridae/*enzymology', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Spumavirus/enzymology', 'Static Electricity', 'Substrate Specificity']",2005/03/16 09:00,2005/04/27 09:00,['2005/03/16 09:00'],"['2005/03/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/27 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['79/7/4213 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.79.7.4213-4218.2005 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2005 Apr;79(7):4213-8. doi: 10.1128/JVI.79.7.4213-4218.2005.,,,,,PMC1061542,,,,,,,,,,,,

To probe the functions of p12 in the early steps of MLV replication, we tested whether p12 can be replaced by spleen necrosis virus (SNV) p18, human immunodeficiency virus type 1 p6, or Rous sarcoma virus p2b. Analyses revealed that all chimeras generated virions at levels similar to that of MLV gag-pol; however, none of them could support MLV vector replication, and all of them exhibited severely reduced DNA synthesis upon virus infection. Because a previously reported SNV gag-MLV pol chimera, but not the MLV hybrid with SNV p18, can support replication of an MLV vector, we hypothesized that other Gag proteins act cooperatively with p12 during the early phase of virus replication. To test this hypothesis, we generated three more MLV-based chimeras containing SNV CA, p18-CA, or p18-CA-NC. We found that the MLV chimera containing SNV p18-CA or p18-CA-NC could support MLV vector replication, but the chimera containing SNV CA could not. Furthermore, viruses derived from the MLV chimera with SNV CA could synthesize viral DNA upon infection but were blocked at a post-reverse-transcription step and generated very little two long terminal repeat circle DNA, thereby producing a phenotype similar to that of the provirus formation-defective p12 mutants. Taken together, our data indicate that when p12/p18 or CA was from different viruses, despite abundant virus production and proper Gag processing, the resulting viruses were not infectious. However, when p12/p18 and CA were from the same virus, even though they were from SNV and not MLV, the resulting viruses were infectious. Therefore, these results suggest a cooperative effect of p12 and CA during the early events of MLV replication.","['Lee, Sook-Kyung', 'Nagashima, Kunio', 'Hu, Wei-Shau']","['Lee SK', 'Nagashima K', 'Hu WS']","['HIV Drug Resistance Program, National Cancer Institute at Frederick, Frederick, MD 21702, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Capsid Proteins)', '0 (DNA, Circular)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Gag protein p12, moloney murine leukemia virus)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '0 (gag Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus)', '0 (p6 gag protein, Human immunodeficiency virus 1)']",IM,"['Capsid Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'DNA, Circular/biosynthesis', 'DNA, Viral/biosynthesis', 'Gene Products, gag/genetics/*physiology', 'Genes, Viral', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics/*physiology/ultrastructure', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Mutation', 'RNA, Viral/metabolism', 'Recombination, Genetic', 'Reverse Transcription', 'Viral Proteins/genetics/physiology', 'Virion/physiology/ultrastructure', 'Virus Assembly/genetics', '*Virus Replication', 'gag Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus']",2005/03/16 09:00,2005/04/27 09:00,['2005/03/16 09:00'],"['2005/03/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/27 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['79/7/4159 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.79.7.4159-4169.2005 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2005 Apr;79(7):4159-69. doi: 10.1128/JVI.79.7.4159-4169.2005.,,,,,PMC1061564,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite years of study, only recently has a bona fide candidate cellular receptor, glucose transporter 1 (glut-1), been identified. Although glut-1 was shown to bind specifically to the ectodomain of HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 envelope glycoproteins, which was reversible with small interfering RNA directed against glut-1, cellular susceptibility to HTLV upon expression of glut-1 was not established. Here we show that expression of glut-1 in relatively resistant MDBK cells conferred increased susceptibility to both HTLV-1- and HTLV-2-pseudotyped particles. glut-1 also markedly increased syncytium formation in MDBK cells after exposure to HTLV-1. Another assay also demonstrated HTLV-1 envelope-cell fusion in the presence of glut-1.

Only five of the autosomal enFeLV sites were present in all four cats, and at only one autosomal locus, B4q15, was enFeLV present in both homologues of all four cats. A single enFeLV occurred in the X chromosome of the Burmese cat, while three to five enFeLV proviruses occurred in each Y chromosome. The X chromosome and nine autosomal enFeLV loci were telomeric, suggesting that ectopic recombination between nonhomologous subtelomeres may contribute to enFeLV distribution.

Notably, TRIM5alpha proteins from several New World monkey species restricted infection by SIVmac and the SIV of African green monkeys, SIVagm. Spider monkey TRIM5alpha, which has an expanded B30.2 domain v3 region due to a tandem triplication, potently blocked infection by a range of retroviruses, including SIVmac, SIVagm, HIV-1, and N-MLV. Tandem duplications in the TRIM5alpha B30.2 domain v1 region of African green monkeys are also associated with broader antiretroviral activity.

That MLL+ acute myeloid leukemia (AML) can arise following chemotherapy with DNA topoisomerase II (DNAt2) inhibitors suggests that these substances, which also occur naturally in foods, may contribute toward infant leukemia. We hypothesized that maternal consumption of dietary DNAt2 inhibitors during pregnancy would increase the risk of infant leukemia, particularly AML(MLL+). METHODS: This Children's Oncology Group case-control study consisted of 240 incident cases of infant acute leukemia [AML and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)] diagnosed during 1996 to 2002 and 255 random digit dialed controls. Maternal diet during pregnancy was determined through a food frequency questionnaire. An index of specific foods identified a priori to contain DNAt2 inhibitors as well as vegetables and fruits were created and analyzed using unconditional logistic regression. RESULTS: There was little evidence of an association between the specific DNAt2 index and leukemia overall and by subtype. An exception was AML(MLL+); odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) comparing the second to fourth quartiles to the first were 1.9 (0.5-7.0), 2.1 (0.6-7.7), and 3.2 (0.9-11.9), respectively (P for trend = 0.10). For the vegetable and fruit index, there were significant or near-significant inverse linear trends for all leukemias combined, ALL(MLL+), and AML(MLL-). CONCLUSION: Overall, maternal consumption of fresh vegetables and fruits during pregnancy was associated with a decreased risk of infant leukemia, particularly MLL+. However, for AML(MLL+) cases, maternal consumption of specific DNAt2 inhibitors seemed to increase risk. Although based on small numbers, these data provide some support for distinct etiologic pathways in infant leukemia.","['Spector, Logan G', 'Xie, Yang', 'Robison, Leslie L', 'Heerema, Nyla A', 'Hilden, Joanne M', 'Lange, Beverly', 'Felix, Carolyn A', 'Davies, Stella M', 'Slavin, Joanne', 'Potter, John D', 'Blair, Cindy K', 'Reaman, Gregory H', 'Ross, Julie A']","['Spector LG', 'Xie Y', 'Robison LL', 'Heerema NA', 'Hilden JM', 'Lange B', 'Felix CA', 'Davies SM', 'Slavin J', 'Potter JD', 'Blair CK', 'Reaman GH', 'Ross JA']","['Division of Pediatric Epidemiology and Clinical Research, Department of Pediatrics, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA. spector@epi.umn.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev,"Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology",9200608,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Age of Onset', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child, Preschool', '*Diet', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Fruit', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/enzymology/*etiology/genetics', 'Male', '*Maternal-Fetal Exchange', 'Odds Ratio', 'Pregnancy', '*Topoisomerase II Inhibitors', 'Vegetables']",2005/03/16 09:00,2005/07/26 09:00,['2005/03/16 09:00'],"['2005/03/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/26 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['14/3/651 [pii]', '10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-04-0602 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev. 2005 Mar;14(3):651-5. doi: 10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-04-0602.,,,,"['R01 CA079940/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA79940/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Killing of autologous cells is prevented as NK cells co-express inhibitory receptors for self-MHC class I molecules. Human NK cells discriminate between different allelic forms of MHC molecules via killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs), which are clonally distributed, and each cell in the repertoire bears at least one receptor that is specific for self-MHC class I molecules. Consequently, when faced with mismatched allogeneic targets, NK cells in the repertoire will sense the missing expression of self-MHC class I alleles and will mediate alloreactions. Recent studies in murine transplant models and data from mismatched haematopoietic transplant trials demonstrate MHC class I mismatches, which generate an alloreactive NK-cell response in the graft-versus-host direction, eradicate leukaemia, improve engraftment and protect against T-cell-mediated graft-versus-host disease.","['Ruggeri, Loredana', 'Mancusi, Antonella', 'Capanni, Marusca', 'Martelli, Massimo F', 'Velardi, Andrea']","['Ruggeri L', 'Mancusi A', 'Capanni M', 'Martelli MF', 'Velardi A']","['Division of Haematology and Clinical Immunology, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Perugia, Policlinico Monteluce, 06122 Perugia, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",,England,Curr Opin Immunol,Current opinion in immunology,8900118,"['0 (Isoantibodies)', '0 (Isoantigens)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Humans', '*Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Isoantibodies/immunology', 'Isoantigens/immunology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Neoplasms/*immunology/*therapy']",2005/03/16 09:00,2005/07/13 09:00,['2005/03/16 09:00'],"['2005/03/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0952-7915(05)00009-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.coi.2005.01.007 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Opin Immunol. 2005 Apr;17(2):211-7. doi: 10.1016/j.coi.2005.01.007.,50,,,['1 P01 CA 100265-01A1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Among 30,221 first primary oral squamous cell carcinoma patients, 6163 (20.4%) patients developed a second primary cancer, 5042 of which were metachronous.

To study the role of PU.1 in erythroleukemia, we have used murine erythroleukemia cells, isolated from Friend virus-infected mice. Expression of PU.1 small interfering RNA in these cells led to significant inhibition of PU.1 levels. This was accompanied by inhibition of proliferation and restoration in the ability of the proerythroblastic cells to produce hemoglobin, i.e., reversion of the leukemic phenotype.

METHODS: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) isolated by HES-Ficoll two-step method were incubated 2 hours to select adherent monocytes. The adherent monocytes were then cultured in the presence of GM-CSF and IL-4 for 5 days and then divided into four groups: DCs were fused with K562 cells or CML cells from CML patients in the presence of 500 g/L PEG-100 mL/L DMSO (Group A), DCs were loaded with lysates from K562 cells or CML cells (group B), DCs were co-cultured with K562 cells or CML cells (group C) and DCs were cultured alone (group D). Before cell fusion, K562 cells were labeled using a red fluorescent dye, PKH26. After fusion, flow cytometry was used to detect hybrids labeled by both PKH26 and FITC-conjugated anti-HLA-ABC mAb to assess the efficiency of fusion. On day 6, TNF-alpha was added to induce the terminal maturation of DCs. Then each group DCs were co-cultured with autologous T cells respectively. The cytotoxicity of CTLs of each group against different target cells was measured using MTT coloremetry. RESULTS: DCs induced by GM-CSF+IL-4 and TNF-alpha had DC-classical phenotypic characteristics. The efficiency of cell fusion ranged from 17.33% to 29.94%. Both DC-K562 hybrids and DC loaded with leukemic freeze-thaw lysates could stimulate specific CTL responses against target cells. Furthermore, the cytotoxicity induced by the former DCs were much stronger than that induced by lysates-loaded DCs at the same E/T ratio. CONCLUSION: Compared with freeze-thaw lysates loaded DCs, DC-leukemic hybrids showed higher efficiency in antigen presentation and the stimulation of leukemia-specific CTLs.","['Sheng, Li-xia', 'Qiu, Guo-qiang', 'Xie, Xiao-bao', 'Gu, Wei-ying', 'Wang, Zhi-lin', 'Wu, Hao-qing']","['Sheng LX', 'Qiu GQ', 'Xie XB', 'Gu WY', 'Wang ZL', 'Wu HQ']","['Department of Hematology, The Third Affiliated Hospital, Soochow University, Changzhou 213000, China. slx800408@chinaren.com']",['chi'],"['Comparative Study', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,China,Xi Bao Yu Fen Zi Mian Yi Xue Za Zhi,Xi bao yu fen zi mian yi xue za zhi = Chinese journal of cellular and molecular immunology,101139110,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*immunology', 'Cell Differentiation/immunology', 'Dendritic Cells/*cytology/*immunology', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia/*immunology/*pathology/therapy', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology/pathology']",2005/03/16 09:00,2009/04/25 09:00,['2005/03/16 09:00'],"['2005/03/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/25 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/16 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Xi Bao Yu Fen Zi Mian Yi Xue Za Zhi. 2005 Mar;21(2):205-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Membrane cholesterol controlled the ATPase activity of P-gp in a linear manner, whereas the P-gp-induced daunomycin efflux decreased nonlinearly with the depletion of membrane cholesterol. All these elements suggest that cholesterol controls both the ATPase and the drug efflux activities of P-gp. In addition, in CEM cell lines that expressed increasing levels of elevated chemoresistance, the amount of P-gp increases to a plateau value of 40% of the total membrane proteins and remained unvaried while the amount of membrane cholesterol increased with the elevation of the MDR level, strongly suggesting that cholesterol may be directly involved in the typical MDR phenotype.

Although the genesis of HAM/TSP likely involves several steps, the generation of a highly specific and effective population of Tax-specific CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) that migrate to the central nervous system (CNS) is of pivotal importance in this neuropathologic process. Presentation of Tax peptides by activated dendritic cells (DCs) to naive CD8+ T cells likely plays an important role in the induction of a Tax-specific CTL response and the eventual neurologic dysfunction observed in HAM/TSP. The immune response mounted during HTLV-I infection is primarily targeted against Tax with both Tax-specific antibodies and CTLs found in HTLV-I-infected individuals, indicating that Tax is available for immune recognition. Studies have suggested that Tax may be secreted from HTLV-I-infected cells and act as an extracellular cytokine, be internalized and processed for presentation, or be transported to the nucleus where it may act as a transcriptional activator. The authors report in this article that purified Tax induces DC activation involving an increase in the production of CD80 and CD86 mRNA in the absence of corresponding protein synthesis. Furthermore, intracellular Tax down-regulates the protein expression of molecules involved in antigen presentation. This implies a difference in the mechanism of Tax activity depending upon its location. Additionally, treatment of JAWS II DCs with extracellular Tax decreases the ability of DCs to present a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I-restricted peptide, indicating that Tax likely matures the DCs to the point where presentation of a secondary antigen is restricted. The implication of the experimental results with respect to the generation of a Tax-specific CTL compartment that participates in the genesis of HAM/TSP is discussed.","['Mostoller, Kate', 'Norbury, Christopher C', 'Jain, Pooja', 'Wigdahl, Brian']","['Mostoller K', 'Norbury CC', 'Jain P', 'Wigdahl B']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, The Pennsylvania State University, College of Medicine, Hershey, Pennsylvania, USA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,J Neurovirol,Journal of neurovirology,9508123,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (B7-1 Antigen)', '0 (B7-2 Antigen)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (CD40 Antigens)', '0 (CD86 protein, human)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigen Presentation', 'Antigens, CD/drug effects/metabolism', 'B7-1 Antigen/drug effects/metabolism', 'B7-2 Antigen', 'Biomarkers', 'CD40 Antigens/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects/physiology', 'Dendritic Cells/*drug effects/metabolism/*virology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Products, tax/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'HTLV-I Infections/*physiopathology', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/drug effects/metabolism', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Time Factors']",2005/03/16 09:00,2005/04/20 09:00,['2005/03/16 09:00'],"['2005/03/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/20 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/16 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/13550280490521104 [doi]'],ppublish,J Neurovirol. 2004 Dec;10(6):358-71. doi: 10.1080/13550280490521104.,,,,"['AI056094/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA54559/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'NS044801-01/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is especially noteworthy that this disease likely arises from plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), described previously as plasmacytoid T-cells, which have an important role in innate and adaptive immunity. However, the exact relationship between the tumor cells and pDCs remains to be elucidated. We encountered a patient with typical blastic NK cell lymphoma, which later converted to leukemic manifestations, and tried to establish a cell line using the leukemic cells. We succeeded in establishment of a novel cell line, CAL-1, which originated from the primary malignant cells. The genetic and phenotypic features of CAL-1 cells bear a similarity to those of pDCs, namely, plasmacytoid morphology at light and electron microscopy; negative results for CD11c and lineage-associated markers of CD3, CD14, CD19, and CD16; positive results for HLA-DR, CD4, CD56, CD45RA, and CD123; and negative results for TCR and IgH gene rearrangements. An interesting finding was that CAL-1 cells change morphologically into the mature DC appearance with many long dendrites after short-term culture in the presence of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and interleukin 3. CAL-1 cells can secrete tumor necrosis factor alpha but not interferon alpha. Thus although they do not share in part phenotypic and functional features with their normal counterparts, CAL-1 cells mostly exhibit a striking pDC phenotype.

Controls consisted of HL-60 blasts treated with A23187, Bis-1 alone, or media. We noted that blasts cultured in media, Bis-1, or Bis-1 then A23187 did not develop the morphologic and phenotypic DC characteristics, up-regulate Rel B, or activate allogeneic T-cells. Our findings suggested that PKC blockade inhibits morphologic, phenotypic, and functional differentiation of HL-60 promyeloblasts into antigen-presenting DCs. Our findings supported the role of PKC as an obligatory pathway for calcium ionophore A23187-induced differentiation of HL-60 myeloblasts into antigen-presenting DCs.","['Li, Qian', 'Ozer, Howard', 'Lindner, Inna', 'Lee, Kelvin P', 'Kharfan-Dabaja, Mohamed A']","['Li Q', 'Ozer H', 'Lindner I', 'Lee KP', 'Kharfan-Dabaja MA']","['Section of Hematology-Oncology, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma 73104, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (Indoles)', '0 (Maleimides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RELB protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '147337-75-5 (Transcription Factor RelB)', '37H9VM9WZL (Calcimycin)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'L79H6N0V6C (bisindolylmaleimide I)']",IM,"['Antigen-Presenting Cells', 'Calcimycin/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Dendritic Cells/*cytology/immunology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/methods', 'Indoles/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*pathology', 'Maleimides/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase C/*antagonists & inhibitors/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Transcription Factor RelB', 'Transcription Factors/genetics', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",2005/03/16 09:00,2005/04/20 09:00,['2005/03/16 09:00'],"['2005/03/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/20 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/16 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1532/ijh97.na0405 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2005 Feb;81(2):131-7. doi: 10.1532/ijh97.na0405.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two isoforms of Arg with different N-termini (1A and 1B) have been described. The C-terminal domain of Arg contains two F-actin-binding sequences that perform a number of actions related to cell morphology and motility by interacting with actin filaments. We have identified different-sized specific cDNAs in hematopoietic, epithelial, nervous, and fibroblastic cells by means of the reverse transcription (RT)-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of human Arg mRNA. Some of these cDNAs showed an adjunctive alternative splice event involving the 63 bp sequence of exon II, thus leading to four cDNA types with different N-termini: 1A long and short, and 1B long and short. Other cDNAs lacked a 309 bp sequence in the last exon involving one of the C-terminal F-actin binding domains, thus giving rise to two cDNA types: C-termini long and short. Quantified by real-time PCR-quantitative RT-PCR-these Arg transcript isoforms have specific expression patterns not only in different normal and tumor cell types, but also during cell differentiation and growth arrest. These isoforms maintained the open reading frames, and eight putative proteins were predicted. The different C-termini isoforms seem to retain the same quantitative reciprocal ratio of their respective transcripts. The Arg protein isoforms with different C-terminal actin-binding domains and different N-termini might have specific cellular localizations/concentrations, and differently regulated catalytic activity with different implications in normal and neoplastic cells.","['Perego, Roberto A', 'Corizzato, Matteo', 'Bianchi, Cristina', 'Eroini, Barbara', 'Bosari, Silvano']","['Perego RA', 'Corizzato M', 'Bianchi C', 'Eroini B', 'Bosari S']","['Department of Experimental & Environmental Medicine and Medical Biotechnologies, School of Medicine, Milano-Bicocca University, Via Cadore 48, 20052 Monza, Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Mol Carcinog,Molecular carcinogenesis,8811105,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '94ZLA3W45F (Arginine)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Arginine/*genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'Granulocytes/cytology/physiology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Lymphocytes/cytology/physiology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Monocytes/cytology/physiology', 'Protein Isoforms/*genetics', 'Reference Values', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2005/03/15 09:00,2005/05/13 09:00,['2005/03/15 09:00'],"['2005/03/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/05/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/15 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/mc.20085 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Carcinog. 2005 Apr;42(4):229-39. doi: 10.1002/mc.20085.,,,,,,,,,"['(c) 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,

The final diagnosis is established by germ culture in blood or in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Preferred treatment is ampicillin in association with aminoglycosides. CASE REPORT: We report the case of a 70-year-old male patient with a history of arterial hypertension and chronic lymphatic leukaemia with no specific treatment, who suffered meningoencephalitis and brain abscesses caused by L. monocytogenes. Symptoms were a 48-hour history of headache and a febrile condition. The CSF showed lymphocytic pleocytosis with hypoglycorrhachia. Magnetic resonance scans of the brain revealed areas of cerebritis and multiple brain abscesses in the right frontal lobe. Specific treatment was established with ampicillin for 13 weeks, associated with gentamicin and vancomycin during the first few weeks, until x-rays showed the lesions to be resolved. CONCLUSIONS: L. monocytogenes infections must be investigated in all patients with cellular immunosuppression who present febrile symptoms. The central nervous system may be the only area of the body infected. Moreover, this site will need studying in patients who present neurological focus data or an alteration in the state of consciousness and bacteraemia due to L. monocytogenes. Establishing suitable treatment as early as possible can improve the prognosis.","['Adeva-Bartolome, M T', 'de Castro-Garcia, F J', 'Castellanos-Pinedo, F', 'Zurdo-Hernandez, J M']","['Adeva-Bartolome MT', 'de Castro-Garcia FJ', 'Castellanos-Pinedo F', 'Zurdo-Hernandez JM']","['Unidad de Neurologia, Servicio de Medicina Interna, Hospital Virgen del Puerto. mtfj@eresmas.com']",['spa'],"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,Spain,Rev Neurol,Revista de neurologia,7706841,['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)'],IM,"['Aged', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/therapeutic use', '*Brain Abscess/diagnosis/microbiology/pathology', 'Humans', '*Listeria monocytogenes', 'Listeriosis/*diagnosis/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male']",2005/03/15 09:00,2005/09/13 09:00,['2005/03/15 09:00'],"['2005/03/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/15 09:00 [entrez]']",['rn2004160 [pii]'],ppublish,Rev Neurol. 2005 Feb 16-28;40(4):219-21.,,,Abscesos cerebrales por Listeria monocytogenes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We analysed the body cell mass (BCM) (n=26) and REE (n=24) in children undergoing BMT. BCM was adjusted for height (BCM/HT(p)) and expressed as a Z score to represent nutritional status. To determine whether body mass index (BMI) was indicative of nutritional status in children undergoing BMT, BMI Z scores were compared to the reference method of BCM/HT(p) Z scores. Schofield predictive equations of basal metabolic rate (BMR) were compared to measured REE to evaluate the accuracy of the predictive equations. The mean BCM/HT(p) Z score for the subject population was -1.09+/-1.28. There was no significant relationship between BCM/HT(p) Z score and BMI Z score (r=0.34; P>0.05); however there was minimal difference between measured REE and predicted BMR (bias=-11+/-149 kcal/day). The results of this study demonstrate that children undergoing BMT may have suboptimal nutritional status and that BMI is not an accurate indication of nutritional status in this population.

DESIGN: A prospective, randomized trial was designed to compare thoracoscopy with talc insufflation (TTI) to thoracostomy and talc slurry (TS) for patients with documented MPE. MEASUREMENTS: The primary end point was 30-day freedom from radiographic MPE recurrence among surviving patients whose lungs initially re-expanded > 90%. Morbidity, mortality, and quality of life were also assessed. RESULTS: Of 501 patients registered, those eligible were randomized to TTI (n = 242) or TS (n = 240). Patient demographics and primary malignancies were similar between study arms. Overall, there was no difference between study arms in the percentage of patients with successful 30-day outcomes (TTI, 78%; TS, 71%). However, the subgroup of patients with primary lung or breast cancer had higher success with TTI than with TS (82% vs 67%). Common morbidity included fever, dyspnea, and pain. Treatment-related mortality occurred in nine TTI patients and seven TS patients. Respiratory complications were more common following TTI than TS (14% vs 6%). Respiratory failure was observed in 4% of TS patients and 8% of TTI patients, accounting for five toxic deaths and six toxic deaths, respectively. Quality-of-life measurement demonstrated less fatigue with TTI than TS. Patient ratings of comfort and safety were also higher for TTI, but there were no differences on perceived value or convenience of the procedures. CONCLUSIONS: Both methods of talc delivery are similar in efficacy; TTI may be better for patients with either a lung or breast primary. The etiology and incidence of respiratory complications from talc need further exploration.","['Dresler, Carolyn M', 'Olak, Jemi', 'Herndon, James E 2nd', 'Richards, William G', 'Scalzetti, Ernest', 'Fleishman, Stewart B', 'Kernstine, Kemp H', 'Demmy, Todd', 'Jablons, David M', 'Kohman, Leslie', 'Daniel, Thomas M', 'Haasler, George B', 'Sugarbaker, David J']","['Dresler CM', 'Olak J', 'Herndon JE 2nd', 'Richards WG', 'Scalzetti E', 'Fleishman SB', 'Kernstine KH', 'Demmy T', 'Jablons DM', 'Kohman L', 'Daniel TM', 'Haasler GB', 'Sugarbaker DJ']","['Head, Tobacco Unit, International Agency for Research on Cancer, Lyon, France.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Human tumor cells (RKO, LS174T, TE671, and MCF7) were irradiated by DNA-incorporated 5-[125I]iodo-2'-deoxyuridine (125IdUrd) or by gamma-photons. Clonogenic survival was determined by the colony-forming assay. Caspase-3 induction was measured with a fluorogenic substrate assay, and DNA fragmentation was determined by ligation-mediated polymerase chain reaction. DNA arrays were used to assess the expression of the B-cell lymphoma/leukaemia-2 (Bcl-2) family and related genes in RKO cells and in caspase-3-gene-defective MCF7 cells. RESULTS: After 125IdUrd or y-photon exposure, the highest induction of caspase-3 was observed in the radiation-sensitive cell lines (RKO and LS174T). DNA fragmentation was prominent in the radiosensitive cells and undetectable in TE671 (125IdUrd and gamma-photons) and MCF7 (125IdUrd only) cells. Exposure of RKO and MCF7 cells to 125I decay led to up-regulation of several pro-apoptotic and antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family genes whereas y-irradiation produced minimal activation. CONCLUSIONS: Apoptosis generated by a DNA-incorporated Auger electron emitter is induced through the mitochondrial/caspase-3-mediated pathway and correlates with cellular radiosensitivity. Apoptosis caused by y-radiation can be signaled without activation of Bcl-2 family genes, and DNA fragmentation occurs with or without caspase-3 activation.","['Urashima, Tetsuro', 'Wang, Ketai', 'Adelstein, S James', 'Kassis, Amin I']","['Urashima T', 'Wang K', 'Adelstein SJ', 'Kassis AI']","['Harvard Medical School, 200 Longwood Avenue, Armenise Building, D2-137, Boston, MA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,England,Int J Radiat Biol,International journal of radiation biology,8809243,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Radiopharmaceuticals)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'LGP81V5245 (Idoxuridine)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*radiation effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor/radiation effects', 'DNA/*radiation effects', 'DNA Damage', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Gamma Rays', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*radiation effects', 'Humans', 'Idoxuridine/*adverse effects', 'Neoplasms/genetics/*physiopathology', 'Photons', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Radiopharmaceuticals/adverse effects', 'Signal Transduction/*radiation effects']",2005/03/15 09:00,2005/04/07 09:00,['2005/03/15 09:00'],"['2005/03/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/07 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['VHH7W8RJFVBD9VTB [pii]', '10.1080/09553000400017655 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Radiat Biol. 2004 Nov-Dec;80(11-12):867-74. doi: 10.1080/09553000400017655.,,,,['5 R01 CA15523/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

All cases diagnosed before the age of 20 years, between 1960 and 1989, were collected from all Nordic cancer registries. In total, 13,689 patients were identified as five-year survivors and during the extended follow-up 12.3% of them died. Mortality was analysed by decade of diagnosis, for all sites, and for leukaemia, Hodgkin's lymphoma, and central nervous system tumours separately. Analyses were done within a Cox proportional hazards regression framework with adjustments made for gender and age at diagnosis. Hazard ratios were calculated in relation to a weighted Nordic mean based on the proportion of five-year survivors in each country. Overall late mortality was significantly higher in Denmark and Finland than in Norway and Sweden. This could not be explained by inverse differences in five-year survival. The differences diminished over time and had disappeared in the last period. The pattern was similar for both genders. The disappearance of the differences was most probably the effect of a closer collaboration between Nordic paediatric oncologists with development and implementation of common protocols for treatment of childhood cancers in all countries.","['Moller, Torgil R', 'Garwicz, Stanislaw', 'Perfekt, Roland', 'Barlow, Lotti', 'Winther, Jeanette Falck', 'Glattre, Eystein', 'Olafsdottir, Gudridur', 'Olsen, Jorgen H', 'Ritvanen, Annukka', 'Sankila, Risto']","['Moller TR', 'Garwicz S', 'Perfekt R', 'Barlow L', 'Winther JF', 'Glattre E', 'Olafsdottir G', 'Olsen JH', 'Ritvanen A', 'Sankila R']","['Department of Cancer Epidemiology and Paediatrics, University Hospital, Lund, Sweden.

In 81.6% of the episodes the patients had a haematological disorder, dominated by acute leukaemia (41.3%), chronic leukaemia (16.3%) and lymphoma (10%). The proportion of piperacillin-resistant E. coli was higher among haematological patients than non-haematological patients (25% vs 0%, p=0.02) and resistance was associated with piperacillin therapy during the previous month (p=0.05). No difference in clinical outcome was found between haematological patients infected with piperacillin-susceptible or -resistant E. coli (intensive care 12% vs 15%; mortality 22% vs 25%).","['Andersen, Niels Frost', 'Moller, Jens', 'Peterslund, Niels Anker']","['Andersen NF', 'Moller J', 'Peterslund NA']","['Department of Haematology, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark. nielsfrost@dadlnet.dk']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Scand J Infect Dis,Scandinavian journal of infectious diseases,0215333,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '4O5J85GJJB (Netilmicin)', 'X00B0D5O0E (Piperacillin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Bacteremia/blood/drug therapy/*epidemiology/microbiology/mortality', 'Denmark/epidemiology', '*Drug Resistance, Bacterial', 'Escherichia coli Infections/blood/drug therapy/*epidemiology/microbiology/mortality', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Medical Records', 'Middle Aged', 'Netilmicin/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Piperacillin/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Retrospective Studies']",2005/03/15 09:00,2005/04/09 09:00,['2005/03/15 09:00'],"['2005/03/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/09 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['VMN3D1RQXBBY1A95 [pii]', '10.1080/00365540510027219 [doi]']",ppublish,Scand J Infect Dis. 2005;37(2):90-5. doi: 10.1080/00365540510027219.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unlike other cancer settings, T cells constitute only a small fraction of CLL patients' PBMC. To generate large numbers of Xcellerated T Cells of high purity from CLL patients' PBMC, a reproducible, streamlined and cost-effective good manufacturing process (GMP) is required. METHODS: The 10-L volume Wave Bioreactor-based Xcellerate III Process using Xcyte Dynabeads in a single custom 20-L Cellbag container was adapted, qualified and implemented for GMP operations. RESULTS: For n=17 CLL patients, starting with approximately 1.34 x 10(9) CD3+ T cells at 6.8+/-7.5% purity in the PBMC leukapheresis products, using the 10-L volume Wave Bioreactor-based Xcellerate III Process, it was feasible to manufacture 137.0+/-34.3 x 10(9) Xcellerated T Cells at 98.5+/-1.0% CD3+ T-cell purity. An average 400-fold clearance of malignant B cells was documented during the manufacturing process. The Xcellerated T Cells produced from the Xcellerate III Process exhibited high in vitro biologic activity and have their T-cell receptor repertoire restored to a normal diversity. In-process T-cell activation was reproducibly robust, as measured by increase in cell size, up-regulation of CD25 and CD154 expression and the secretion of IL-2, IFN-gamma and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha. DISCUSSION: A low-volume, high-yield bioreactor-based process has been developed, qualified and implemented for the reproducible, GMP manufacture of high purity, biologically active Xcellerated T Cells for the treatment of CLL patients in clinical trials.","['Hami, L S', 'Green, C', 'Leshinsky, N', 'Markham, E', 'Miller, K', 'Craig, S']","['Hami LS', 'Green C', 'Leshinsky N', 'Markham E', 'Miller K', 'Craig S']","['Xcyte Therapies Inc.

Methods Thirty-three patients [median age 42 years, range 23-55 years, diagnosis AML/myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) 14, ALL nine, CML seven and multiple myeloma (MM) three] received myeloablative conditioning followed by infusion of selected CD34+ cells from matched unrelated donors (31) or HLA-identical siblings (two). Early donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI; 0.5 and 1.0 x 10(6) CD3+ cells/kg) were given while patients were on immunosuppressive therapy. RESULTS: Ninety-seven per cent of patients engrafted and 24 of 29 patients surviving more than 30 days received at least one pre-emptive DLI. Three patients (10%) developed acute (a)GvHD (two grade I-II, one grade III-IV) spontaneously, and 16 patients (67%) developed aGvHD after DLI (12 grade I-II, four grade III-IV). Eight of 24 evaluable patients developed chronic (c)GvHD (33%, six limited, two extensive). After a median follow-up of 590 days (range 138-1610 days) 18 patients were alive (55%), 16 in complete remission (CR), one in hematologic and one in molecular relapse. Seven patients died after relapse (21%) and eight died from transplantation-related causes (24%). Patients with myeloid malignancies had a significantly better survival than patients with ALL or MM (74%+/-10 vs. 30%+/-13, P<0.05).

Primary endpoints were the prevalence of integument reactions, prevalence and type of rash. Eighty-four leukaemia and myeloma patients were seen on 200 episodes. Integument changes were seen in 88% of episodes. Predictable changes such as hair loss (74%) and mucositis (38%) were seen commonly. Rashes were seen in 38% of episodes. The most common rash was palm and sole erythema (10% of all episodes) which was associated with allogeneic BMT (20%; p=0.0009). Flexural erythema with subsequent desquamation occurred in 4% of episodes, more commonly in males (p=0.09). Drug allergies were seen in 14 of 200 episodes and were significantly associated with antibiotics (p=0.003). Patients' perceived their skin problems as moderate or severe in 19% of the episodes. The impact on resources in the haematology practice was large; 45% of inpatients were receiving topical or systemic skin treatment, in 5% of patients the oncology treatment was compromised, 11% of patients required extra nursing and 3% of patients stayed longer in hospital.

Patients with this leukemia may develop large cell lymphoma (LCL) known as Richter's syndrome (RS). RS occurs in CLL patients of about 3% and may develop in a single lymph node or more often in a group of nodes. However, in some patients extranodal localization of aggressive lymphoma in RS has been observed. Besides LCL, Hodgkin's disease, prolymphocytoid leukemia, multiple myeloma and acute lymphoblastic leukemia may also occur as RS variants. The origin of lymphoid cells in RS remains tentative. However, CLL and RS originate from the same clone for some patients, whereas, in other patients cells of aggressive lymphoma do not have the features of the same clone as the CLL cells. The prognosis of RS is poor. Survival in different studies will be usually 2-5 months. The secondary development or coexistence of myeloproliferative disorders or myelodysplastic syndrome and solid tumors have also been rarely documented in CLL patients. It is of great concern that therapy may further increase the risk of a second neoplasm. However, until now, there are no clear evidence that alkylating agents or purine nucleoside analogs may be associated with an increased incidence of second malignancies in patients with CLL. In this review, epidemiology, biology, clinical characteristic and treatment approaches in RS and other secondary neoplasms in patients with CLL are discussed.","['Robak, Tadeusz']",['Robak T'],"['Department of Hematology, Medical University of Lodz and Copernicus Memorial Hospital, Lodz, Pabianicka, Poland. robaktad@csk.am.lodz.pl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,,IM,"['Cell Lineage', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*complications/mortality/therapy', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/*etiology/mortality/therapy', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*etiology/mortality/therapy']",2005/03/15 09:00,2005/04/29 09:00,['2005/03/15 09:00'],"['2005/03/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/29 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['KPV36N65RCDQUBJ3 [pii]', '10.1080/10245330400018599 [doi]']",ppublish,Hematology. 2004 Oct-Dec;9(5-6):387-400. doi: 10.1080/10245330400018599.,179,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The data regarding the alterations of endogenous thrombopoietin (TPO) regulation during the clinical course of AML are limited. The aim of this study was to investigate endogenous TPO dynamics in association with platelets during the clinical course of AML. We serially measured both TPO and platelets concurrently over the entire treatment period of newly diagnosed patients receiving both remission induction and consolidation chemotherapies. The median concentration of TPO in AML patients at the initial diagnosis was 469.71 pg/ml and increased significantly during the aplastic period due to remission induction chemotherapy (median: 1085.33 pg/ml) but then decreased to a level (median: 45.26 pg/ml) encountered in the healthy control subjects (median: 56.90 pg/ml). In the cytopenic period due to consolidation treatment, TPO level again increased significantly to a high level (median: 891.38 pg/ml) during the platelet nadir, but decreased toward normal (median: 100.75 pg/ml) after the thrombocytopenic period had elapsed. In conclusion, endogenous TPO levels exhibit an inverse fluctuation in relation to platelet counts during the clinical course of AML. Pharmacological stimulation of thrombopoiesis in AML with novel molecules, including the recombinant thrombopoietins and the small peptide agonists, should be based on a critical administration strategy that must consider the endogenous levels of TPO. TPO levels in distinct AML disease states may explain the unsuccessful recombinant TPO trials and could help to design better strategies for 'pharmacological stimulation of thrombopoiesis' in AML.","['Gonen, Can', 'Haznedaroglu, Ibrahim C', 'Aksu, Salih', 'Koca, Ebru', 'Goker, Hakan', 'Buyukasik, Yahya', 'Sayinalp, Nilgun', 'Ozcebe, Osman', 'Dundar, Semra']","['Gonen C', 'Haznedaroglu IC', 'Aksu S', 'Koca E', 'Goker H', 'Buyukasik Y', 'Sayinalp N', 'Ozcebe O', 'Dundar S']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Hacettepe University School of Medicine, Sihhiye, 06100 Ankara, Turkey. drcgnn@yahoo.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Platelets,Platelets,9208117,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '9014-42-0 (Thrombopoietin)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Blood Platelets/drug effects', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Disease Management', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infections/blood/etiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*blood/complications/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Platelet Count', 'Remission Induction', 'Thrombocytopenia/blood/etiology', 'Thrombopoiesis', 'Thrombopoietin/*blood']",2005/03/15 09:00,2005/05/06 09:00,['2005/03/15 09:00'],"['2005/03/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/05/06 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['G9JEYV7TW4DFLAHV [pii]', '10.1080/09537100412331272578 [doi]']",ppublish,Platelets. 2005 Feb;16(1):31-7. doi: 10.1080/09537100412331272578.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is the first report of dual infections with two subgroups of ALV occurring in the same chicken. The effectiveness of ALV-J eradication measures is indicated by the absence of any ALV-J isolations in late 2003. ALV-A however, continued to be isolated from the broiler population.

Whilst effects of assisted reproductive technology (ART) on birth outcomes are well documented little is known about effects on child health after the neonatal period. Childhood cancer is one area warranting further examination. The hypothesis that cancer in children may be initiated during early fetal development means that events leading up to and around conception may be important. Whilst the few large-scale epidemiological studies that have looked at childhood cancer incidence following ART have failed to find any significant increased risk, some case-control studies have reported an increased risk of specific cancers. However, it is important not to over interpret these findings as the reason for the infertility may be the predisposing factor, rather than the procedure itself.

Unfortunately its poor aqueous solubility hampers its parenteral formulation. To date, there is no parenteral formulation of ATRA commercially available and oral administration of ATRA is associated with progressively diminishing ATRA levels in plasma, which is related to induction of retinoic acid-binding protein and increased drug catabolism by cytochrome P-450-mediated reaction. An ATRA formulation, obtained by complexation of the drug into polymeric micelles, might be suitable for parenteral administration overcoming these unwanted effects. To this purpose we prepared an amphiphilic polymer by polyvinylalcohol (PVA) substitution with oleyl amine at 1.5% substitution degree (mol substituent per 100 mol hydroxyvinylmonomer) and evaluated its functional properties with regard to ATRA complexation. The substituted polymer displayed ability to interact with ATRA both in aqueous solution and in the solid state following spray-drying of drug-polymer hydro-alcoholic solutions. The spray-dried complexes rapidly dissolved in water providing high levels of ATRA solubilization as a function of the drug-polymer weight ratio. The complexes characterized by 1:5 drug-polymer weight ratio provided higher levels of ATRA solubilization than 1:3 and 1:10 drug-polymer weight ratios respectively. Pre-formed polymeric micelles in water equilibrated in the presence of excess solid ATRA provided the lowest levels of solubilization. The drug release from the complexes was very slow in PBS, indicating their suitability in antitumor drug targeting where a fundamental requirement is stability towards drug release for at least 24 h, corresponding to the average circulation time period of macromolecular carriers. The cytotoxicity studies against neuroblastoma cell lines outlined increased cytotoxicity of complexed ATRA with respect to free ATRA, likely due to the increased bioavailability of the hydrophobic drug from the complex. We conclude that ATRA entrapped into self-assembling polymer micelles may be a useful parenteral ATRA formulation overcoming the unwanted pharmacological mechanism that lead to acquired retinoid resistance.","['Zuccari, G', 'Carosio, R', 'Fini, A', 'Montaldo, P G', 'Orienti, I']","['Zuccari G', 'Carosio R', 'Fini A', 'Montaldo PG', 'Orienti I']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Bologna Via San Donato 19/2, 40127 Bologna, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,J Control Release,Journal of controlled release : official journal of the Controlled Release Society,8607908,"['0 (Amines)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Micelles)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '9002-89-5 (Polyvinyl Alcohol)', 'ZDQ1JWQ8DT (oleylamine)']",IM,"['Amines/chemistry', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*chemistry/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', '*Drug Compounding', 'Drug Stability', 'Humans', 'Micelles', 'Particle Size', 'Polyvinyl Alcohol/*chemistry', 'Solubility', 'Tretinoin/*chemistry/pharmacology']",2005/03/15 09:00,2005/09/01 09:00,['2005/03/15 09:00'],"['2004/08/18 00:00 [received]', '2004/12/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/03/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/01 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0168-3659(04)00640-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jconrel.2004.12.016 [doi]']",ppublish,J Control Release. 2005 Mar 21;103(2):369-80. doi: 10.1016/j.jconrel.2004.12.016.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has been suggested that stromal presence is important for haematopoiesis in vitro and in vivo, but the question remains: whether diffusible factors produced by stromal cells are sufficient for the regeneration of primitive and definitive haematopoietic cells, or direct cell-to-cell contacts of the cultured material with underlying stromal base would be required. During present studies, influence of various feeder layers and feeder layer conditioned media on proliferative, differentiative and clonogenic activity of human AC133+ derived from human umbilical cord blood was investigated. Cell extracts for feeder layers were prepared from 4-6 weeks old human embryos and co-cultured feeder cells. Effects of the conditioned media were also determined. Culture and feeder layer media were additionally supplemented with commonly implemented factors such as GM-CSF, IL-3 and LIF. Estimation of morpho-functional properties of AC133+ cultivated suspension cultures was performed in subculture experiments using semisolid agar culture conditions. Multipotential CFU-MIX (CFU-GEMM) and unipotential progenitor cells CFU-GM, BFU-E and CFU-E were observed and analyzed. Our data suggest that haematopoiesis can be sustained for prolonged cultivation periods in the presence of feeder layer cells or conditioned media supported culture models. Prolonged support of primitive haematopoietic cells and their clonogenic capacity and functional characteristics in feeder layer positive cultures, indicates that diffusible factors are sufficient for haematopoiesis and suggests that direct cell-to-cell contacts may not be exclusively required for successful long-term in vitro haematopoiesis.","['Bilko, N M', 'Votyakova, I A', 'Vasylovska, S V', 'Bilko, D I']","['Bilko NM', 'Votyakova IA', 'Vasylovska SV', 'Bilko DI']","['Medical Centre of Tissue and Cell Therapy Embryotech, National University Kyiv-Mohyla Academy, Kiev, Ukraine. nadja@bilko.kiev.ua']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Cell Biol Int,Cell biology international,9307129,"['0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['*Cell Communication', 'Cell Culture Techniques/*methods', 'Coculture Techniques/*methods', 'Culture Media, Conditioned', 'Embryo, Mammalian/cytology', 'Female', 'Fetal Blood/cytology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Hematopoiesis/physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-6/pharmacology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Multipotent Stem Cells/cytology', 'Pregnancy', 'Stromal Cells/*physiology']",2005/03/15 09:00,2005/06/25 09:00,['2005/03/15 09:00'],"['2004/08/31 00:00 [received]', '2004/11/02 00:00 [revised]', '2004/11/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/03/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/25 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1065-6995(04)00222-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cellbi.2004.11.016 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Biol Int. 2005 Jan;29(1):83-6. doi: 10.1016/j.cellbi.2004.11.016.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bismuth-213 is obtained from a radionuclide generator system from decay of 10-days (225)Ac parent. Recent pre-clinical studies have also shown the potential application of both (213)Bi, and the (225)Ac parent radionuclide in a variety of cancer systems and targeted radiotherapy. This paper describes our five years of experience in production of (225)Ac in partial support of the on-going clinical trials. A four-step chemical process, consisting of both anion and cation exchange chromatography, is utilized for routine separation of carrier-free (225)Ac from a mixture of (228)Th, (229)Th and (232)Th. The separation of Ra and Ac from Th is achieved using the marcoporous anion exchange resin MP1 in 8M HNO(3) media. Two sequential MP1/NO(3) columns provide a separation factor of approximately 10(6) for Ra and Ac from Th. The separation of Ac from Ra is accomplished on a low cross-linking cation exchange resin AG50-X4 using 1.2M HNO(3) as eluant. Two sequential AG50/NO(3) columns provide a separation factor of approximately 10(2) for Ac from Ra. A 60-day processing schedule has been adopted in order to reduce the processing cost and to provide the highest levels of (225)Ac possible. Over an 8-week campaign, a total of approximately 100 mCi of (225)Ac (approximately 80% of the theoretical yield) is shipped in 5-6 batches, with the first batch typically consisting of approximately 50 mCi. After the initial separation and purification of Ac, the Ra pool is re-processed on a bi-weekly schedule or as needed to provide smaller batches of (225)Ac. The averaged radioisotopic purity of the (225)Ac was 99.6 +/- 0.7% with a (225)Ra content of < or =0.6%, and an average (229)Th content of (4(-4)(+5)) x 10(-5)%.","['Boll, Rose A', 'Malkemus, Dairin', 'Mirzadeh, Saed']","['Boll RA', 'Malkemus D', 'Mirzadeh S']","['Nuclear Science and Technology Division, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, TN 37831-6229, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20050128,England,Appl Radiat Isot,"Applied radiation and isotopes : including data, instrumentation and methods for use in agriculture, industry and medicine",9306253,['NIK1K0956U (Actinium)'],IM,"['Actinium/*chemistry/therapeutic use', '*Alpha Particles', 'Chromatography, Ion Exchange', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*radiotherapy', '*Radioimmunotherapy']",2005/03/15 09:00,2005/07/20 09:00,['2005/03/15 09:00'],"['2004/08/10 00:00 [received]', '2004/11/24 00:00 [revised]', '2004/12/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/03/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/20 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0969-8043(04)00601-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.apradiso.2004.12.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Appl Radiat Isot. 2005 May;62(5):667-79. doi: 10.1016/j.apradiso.2004.12.003.

When expressed in K562 leukemia cells, the fusion proteins were capable of triggering a Ca2+-signal upon receptor stimulation, demonstrating their functional integrity. In fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) measurements using confocal microscopy, a strong FRET signal from the plasma membrane region of fixed, resting cells was detected when the receptor was co-expressed with the G protein as the FRET acceptor, as well as when the CFP-tagged receptor was co-expressed with receptor fused to YFP.

The main polymeric platform was prepared from bis(4-hydroxy)butyl maleate (DBM) and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG4000) blocks to give the polymer DBM2-PEG4000 containing biodegradable carbonate bonds and having a M(w) of 100,000-190,000 g/mol; M(n) of 37,000-53,000 g/mol, and M(w)/M(n) of 3.0-3.7. Using thioether linkages, this polymer was then grafted with HS-PEG3000-Gly-Phe-Lue-Gly doxorubicin (HS-PEG3000-GFLG-Dox) pendant side chains ( approximately 30 per DBM2-PEG chain). The final construct, DBM2-PEG4000-S-PEG3000-GFLG-Dox had a total Dox content of 3-4 wt % and a free Dox content of < or = 0.7% total Dox. During incubation with isolated lysosomal enzymes, the rate of Dox release from the polymer backbone was relatively slow (<5% release over 5 h) compared to that seen for PEG5000-GFLG-Dox alone (>20% over 5 h). The in vitro cytotoxicity was assessed using B16F10 murine melanoma (MTT assay). DBM2-PEG4000-S-PEG3000-GFLG-Dox was 10-20-fold less toxic than free Dox. In vivo antitumor activity of the DBM2-PEG4000-S-PEG3000-GFLG-Dox conjugates was assessed using a subcutaneous (s.c.) B16F10 murine melanoma model, and an intraperitoneal (i.p.) L1210 leukaemia model. The increased toxicity (attributed to poor solubility) and low antitumor activity of DBM2-PEG4000-S-PEG3000-GFLG-Dox conjugates compared to PEG5000-GFLG-Dox and HPMA copolymer-Dox conjugates was attributed to the slow rate of Dox release. The DBM2-PEG4000-S-PEG3000-GFLG-Dox conjugates were considered unfavorable as candidates for further development. However, the successful scale-up synthesis of DBM2-PEG4000-S-PEG3000 constructs suggest that they are worthy of further investigation as carriers for controlled release and targeting of less hydrophobic agents.","['Andersson, Lars', 'Davies, John', 'Duncan, Ruth', 'Ferruti, Paolo', 'Ford, Jayne', 'Kneller, Samantha', 'Mendichi, Raniero', 'Pasut, Gianfranco', 'Schiavon, Oddone', 'Summerford, Clive', 'Tirk, Anders', 'Veronese, Francesco M', 'Vincenzi, Veronica', 'Wu, Gefei']","['Andersson L', 'Davies J', 'Duncan R', 'Ferruti P', 'Ford J', 'Kneller S', 'Mendichi R', 'Pasut G', 'Schiavon O', 'Summerford C', 'Tirk A', 'Veronese FM', 'Vincenzi V', 'Wu G']","['PolyPeptide Laboratories (Sweden) AB, PO Box 30089, SE 20061 Limhamn, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Biomacromolecules,Biomacromolecules,100892849,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Polyesters)', '0 (Polymers)', '0 (Prodrugs)', '3WJQ0SDW1A (Polyethylene Glycols)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*chemical synthesis/chemistry', 'Biodegradation, Environmental', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Doxorubicin/*administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives/chemical synthesis/therapeutic use', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Kinetics', 'Liver/enzymology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/drug therapy', 'Polyesters', 'Polyethylene Glycols/chemical synthesis/therapeutic use', 'Polymers/*chemical synthesis/therapeutic use', 'Prodrugs/administration & dosage/chemical synthesis', 'Rats', 'Treatment Outcome']",2005/03/15 09:00,2005/08/19 09:00,['2005/03/15 09:00'],"['2005/03/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/19 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/15 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/bm049381p [doi]'],ppublish,Biomacromolecules. 2005 Mar-Apr;6(2):914-26. doi: 10.1021/bm049381p.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of CD58 expression decreased significantly as nonmalignant B cells differentiated in the bone marrow from an early to a mature stage. Few nonneoplastic B cells at a mid or mature stage of development expressed CD58 MFI values comparable to those seen in leukemic cases. Early-stage nonneoplastic B-cell precursors expressed relatively higher CD58 levels, which frequently overlapped with the variable level of CD58 expression observed among leukemic blasts. As a group, however, the malignant precursor B-ALL cells showed significantly higher expression of CD58 than nonmalignant B-cell populations at any maturational stage.

Due to inadequate diagnostic facilities and lack of health education they are diagnosed at an advanced stage when treatment is either impossible or very difficult. In our study, sixty patients with haematological malignancies were studied from 1-1-1999 to 1-1-2001, at Ayub Teaching Hospital. Abbottabad. METHODS: Patients were interviewed in detail, a thorough physical examination and blood tests including haemoglobin estimation, total and differential leukocyte count, platelets count, reticulocyte count and blood film examination was done on each patient. Bone marrow examination for routine giemsa staining and cytochemistry was also done in each case. Trephine biopsy was done in selected cases. RESULTS: About 35.9% patients had acute myeloid leukemia, while 19.15% patients had acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Non Hodgkin's lymphoma was seen in 15.39% cases. Among chronic leukemias, chronic lymphocytic leukemia outnumbered chronic myeloid leukemia (13.91% against 10.76%). Multiple myeloma was seen in 4.61% patients while a single patient had Hodgkin's disease. Male to female ratio in haematological malignancies was 1.4:1 and majority of the patients (66.66) belonged to two districts (i.e. Mansehra and Abbottabad). Low grade fever, progressive pallor, weakness and body aches were the commonest symptoms (70% cases) while pallor was the frequently observed sign. Medium age for acute myeloid and acute lymphoblastic leukemia was 26 years and 7 years respectively. For chronic myeloid and chronic lymphocytic leukemia it was 22 years and 56 years respectively. In case of non Hodgkin's lymphoma it was 22.5 years. CONCLUSION: In our study acute myeloid leukemia was the commonest type of haematological malignancy. Males were affected more than the females. Majority of the patients belonged to districts Mansehra and Abbottabad. Non specific symptoms like low grade fever, progressive pallor and bodyaches were the commonest symptoms while pallor was the most frequently observed sign.","['Idris, Muhammad', 'Shah, S H', 'Fareed, Jamila', 'Gul, Nasreen']","['Idris M', 'Shah SH', 'Fareed J', 'Gul N']","['Department of Pathology, Ayub Medical College, Abbottahad, Pakistan. midris63@yahoo.com']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",,Pakistan,J Ayub Med Coll Abbottabad,"Journal of Ayub Medical College, Abbottabad : JAMC",8910750,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Distribution', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/methods', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Developing Countries', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*epidemiology/*pathology/therapy', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pakistan/epidemiology', 'Risk Assessment', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Sex Distribution', 'Survival Analysis']",2005/03/15 09:00,2005/04/06 09:00,['2005/03/15 09:00'],"['2005/03/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/06 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/15 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Ayub Med Coll Abbottabad. 2004 Oct-Dec;16(4):51-4.,20,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS) is a multicenter cohort study of >/= 5-year survivors of pediatric cancer diagnosed between 1970 and 1986. Self-reported heights and weights were used to calculate BMI for 7195 adult survivors, compared with population-based, age-specific, and gender-specific norms from the 1995 National Health Interview Survey. Underweight was defined as a BMI < 18.5 kg/m(2) and obese as BMI >/= 30 kg/m(2). RESULTS: Survivors of leukemia were more likely to be obese (females: odds ratio [OR] = 1.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2-1.8; males: OR = 1.2; 95% CI, 1.0-1.5).

In females, treatment with total body irradiation, alkylating agents, and anthracyclines and in males, treatment with abdominal radiation, younger age at treatment, and treatment with anthracyclines and alkylating agents were associated with being underweight. Underweight survivors were more likely to report adverse health and major medical conditions.

Via numerous pathways arsenic induces cellular alterations such as induction of apoptosis, inhibition of cellular proliferation, stimulation of differentiation, and inhibition of angiogenesis. Responses vary depending on cell type, dose and the form of arsenic. GSTO1, a member of the glutathione S-transferase superfamily omega, has recently been shown to be identical to the rate-limiting enzyme, monomethyl arsenous (MMA(V)) reductase which catalyzes methylarsonate (MMA(V)) to methylarsenous acid (MMA(III)) during arsenic biotransformation. In this study, we investigated whether arsenic trioxide (As(2)O(3)) induces apoptosis in both chemosensitive and chemoresistant cell lines that varied in their expression of p28 (gsto1), the mouse homolog of GSTO1. METHODS: The cytotoxicity of arsenic in the gsto1- and bcl-2-expressing chemoresistant and radioresistant LY-ar mouse lymphoma cell line, was compared with that of the LY-ar's parental cell line, LY-as. LY-as cells are radiosensitive, apoptotically permissive, and do not express gsto1 or bcl-2. Cell survival, glutathione (GSH) levels, mitochondrial membrane potential, and stress-activated kinase status after arsenic treatment were examined in these cell lines. RESULTS: As(2)O(3) induced an equivalent dose- and time-dependent increase in apoptosis in these cell lines. Cellular survival, as measured after a 24-h exposure, was also the same in each cell line. Reduced GSH was modulated in a similar time- and dose-dependent manner. Apoptosis was preceded by loss of mitochondrial membrane potential that triggered caspase-mediated pathways associated with apoptosis. With a prolonged exposure of As(2)O(3), both cell lines showed decreased activation of ERK family members, ERK1, ERK2 and ERK5. As(2)O(3) enhanced the death signals in LY-ar cells through a decrease in GSH, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, and abatement of survival signals. This effect is similar to that seen when LY-ar cells are treated with thiol-depleting agents or by the removal of methionine and cysteine (GSH precursor) from the growth medium. This response is also completely contrary to that seen for radiation, actinomycin D, VP-16 and other agents, where LY-ar cells do not succumb to apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS: The overexpression of gsto1 in normally chemoresistant and radioresistant LY-ar cells renders them vulnerable to the cytotoxic effects of As(2)O(3), despite the 30-fold overexpression of the survival factor bcl-2.

In the present study, we used a cDNA microarray method to analyse gene expression patterns in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats and galactose-fed cataractous lenses. In addition, we investigated the regulation and interaction(s) of anti-oxidant protein 2 and lens epithelium-derived growth factor in these models. METHODS: To identify differential gene expression patterns, one group of Sprague-Dawley rats was made diabetic with streptozotocin and a second group was made galactosaemic. Total RNA was extracted from the lenses of both groups and their controls. Labelled cDNA was hybridised to Atlas Rat Arrays. Changes in gene expression level were analysed. Real-time PCR and western analysis were used to validate the microarray results. RESULTS: The expression of 31 genes was significantly modulated in hyperglycaemic lenses compared with galactosaemic lenses. Notably, transcript and protein levels of B-cell leukaemia/lymphoma protein 2 and nuclear factor-kappaB were significantly elevated in rat lenses at 4 weeks after injection of streptozotocin. At a later stage, mRNA and protein levels of TGF-beta were elevated. However, levels of mRNA for IGF-1, lens epithelium-derived growth factor and anti-oxidant protein 2 were diminished in streptozotocin-induced diabetic cataract. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATIONS: These results provide evidence that progression of sugar cataract involves oxidative- and TGF-beta-mediated signalling. These pathways may promote abnormal gene expression in the hyperglycaemic and galactosaemic states and thus may contribute to the symptoms associated with these conditions. Since oxidative stress seems to be a major event in cataract formation, supply of anti-oxidant may postpone the progression of such disorders.","['Kubo, E', 'Singh, D P', 'Akagi, Y']","['Kubo E', 'Singh DP', 'Akagi Y']","['Department of Ophthalmology, Faculty of Medical Science, University of Fukui, 23-3 Shimoaiduki, Matsuoka, Fukui, 910-1193, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",20050311,Germany,Diabetologia,Diabetologia,0006777,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (lens epithelium-derived growth factor)', '67763-96-6 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor I)', 'EC 1.11.1.- (Peroxidases)', 'EC 1.11.1.15 (Peroxiredoxins)', 'X2RN3Q8DNE (Galactose)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'Cataract/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental/chemically induced/*complications', 'Down-Regulation/genetics', 'Galactose/pharmacology', 'Galactosemias/chemically induced/*complications', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor I/genetics', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/metabolism', 'Lens, Crystalline/chemistry/metabolism/pathology', 'NF-kappa B/genetics', '*Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Peroxidases/metabolism', 'Peroxiredoxins', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/genetics', 'Up-Regulation/genetics', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein']",2005/03/12 09:00,2005/09/07 09:00,['2005/03/12 09:00'],"['2004/08/02 00:00 [received]', '2004/11/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/03/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/07 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/12 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00125-005-1687-5 [doi]'],ppublish,Diabetologia. 2005 Apr;48(4):790-8. doi: 10.1007/s00125-005-1687-5.

It is still controversial whether the MLL fusion protein is sufficient to induce acute leukemia without additional genetic alterations, although carcinogenesis in general is known to result from more than 1 genetic disorder accumulating during a lifetime. Here we demonstrate that the fusion partner-mediated homo-oligomerization of MLL-SEPT6 is essential to immortalize hematopoietic progenitors in vitro. MLL-SEPT6 induced myeloproliferative disease with long latency in mice, but not acute leukemia, implying that secondary genotoxic events are required to develop leukemia. We developed in vitro and in vivo model systems of leukemogenesis by MLL fusion proteins, where activated FMS-like receptor tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) together with MLL-SEPT6 not only transformed hematopoietic progenitors in vitro but also induced acute biphenotypic or myeloid leukemia with short latency in vivo. In these systems, MLL-ENL, another type of the fusion product that seems to act as a monomer, also induced the transformation in vitro and leukemogenesis in vivo in concert with activated FLT3. These findings show direct evidence for a multistep leukemogenesis mediated by MLL fusion proteins and may be applicable to development of direct MLL fusion-targeted therapy.","['Ono, Ryoichi', 'Nakajima, Hideaki', 'Ozaki, Katsutoshi', 'Kumagai, Hidetoshi', 'Kawashima, Toshiyuki', 'Taki, Tomohiko', 'Kitamura, Toshio', 'Hayashi, Yasuhide', 'Nosaka, Tetsuya']","['Ono R', 'Nakajima H', 'Ozaki K', 'Kumagai H', 'Kawashima T', 'Taki T', 'Kitamura T', 'Hayashi Y', 'Nosaka T']","['Division of Hematopoietic Factors, The Institute of Medical Science, Department of Pediatrics, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20050310,United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (Cytoskeletal Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Kmt2a protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Flt3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (SEPTIN6 protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (Septins)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Cell Transplantation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytoskeletal Proteins', 'DNA Damage', '*DNA-Binding Proteins/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Dimerization', 'Enzyme Activation', '*GTP-Binding Proteins/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism', 'Liver/pathology/physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', '*Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', '*Proto-Oncogenes/genetics', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*metabolism', '*Recombinant Fusion Proteins/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Septins', 'Spleen/pathology/physiology', '*Transcription Factors/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3']",2005/03/12 09:00,2005/06/29 09:00,['2005/03/12 09:00'],"['2004/07/15 00:00 [received]', '2005/01/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/03/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/29 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/12 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1172/JCI22725 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Invest. 2005 Apr;115(4):919-29. doi: 10.1172/JCI22725.

These changes result in increased mitochondrial matrix volume and fragmentation and may lead to depolarization and alterations in mitochondrial Ca(2+) uptake/retention capacity. At the cellular level, p13(II) has been found to interfere with cell proliferation and transformation and to promote apoptosis induced by ceramide and Fas ligand. Assays carried out in T cells (the major targets of HTLV-1 infection in vivo) demonstrate that p13(II)-mediated sensitization to Fas ligand-induced apoptosis can be blocked by an inhibitor of Ras farnesylation, thus implicating Ras signaling as a downstream target of p13(II) function.","[""D'Agostino, D M"", 'Silic-Benussi, M', 'Hiraragi, H', 'Lairmore, M D', 'Ciminale, V']","[""D'Agostino DM"", 'Silic-Benussi M', 'Hiraragi H', 'Lairmore MD', 'Ciminale V']","['Department of Oncology and Surgical Sciences, University of Padova, Padova 35128, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",,England,Cell Death Differ,Cell death and differentiation,9437445,"['0 (Retroviridae Proteins)', '0 (rof protein, Human T-lymphotropic virus 1)', '0 (tof protein, Human T-lymphotropic virus 1)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cloning, Molecular', '*Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Membranes/drug effects', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects/physiology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Retroviridae Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/*pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects']",2005/03/12 09:00,2006/05/24 09:00,['2005/03/12 09:00'],"['2005/03/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/24 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/12 09:00 [entrez]']","['4401576 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.cdd.4401576 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Death Differ. 2005 Aug;12 Suppl 1:905-15. doi: 10.1038/sj.cdd.4401576.,84,,,"['100730/PHS HHS/United States', 'TW 05705/TW/FIC NIH HHS/United States', 'R03 TW005705/TW/FIC NIH HHS/United States', 'R03 TW005705-03/TW/FIC NIH HHS/United States', 'R03 TW005705-02/TW/FIC NIH HHS/United States', 'R03 TW005705-01A1/TW/FIC NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3057663,,,,,,['NIHMS183534'],,,,,,

In terms of overall survival, no significant differences were observed between the various groups. Patients who received G-CSF after chemotherapy had a shorter time to neutrophil recovery (median, 20 vs 25 days; P < .001) and a shorter hospitalization (mean, 27.2 vs 29.7 days; P < .001). We conclude that although priming with G-CSF can improve the CR rate, the use of G-CSF during and/or after chemotherapy has no effect on the long-term outcome of AML in older patients.","['Amadori, Sergio', 'Suciu, Stefan', 'Jehn, Ulrich', 'Stasi, Roberto', 'Thomas, Xavier', 'Marie, Jean-Pierre', 'Muus, Petra', 'Lefrere, Francois', 'Berneman, Zwi', 'Fillet, George', 'Denzlinger, Claudio', 'Willemze, Roel', 'Leoni, Pietro', 'Leone, Giuseppe', 'Casini, Marco', 'Ricciuti, Francesco', 'Vignetti, Marco', 'Beeldens, Filip', 'Mandelli, Franco', 'De Witte, Theo']","['Amadori S', 'Suciu S', 'Jehn U', 'Stasi R', 'Thomas X', 'Marie JP', 'Muus P', 'Lefrere F', 'Berneman Z', 'Fillet G', 'Denzlinger C', 'Willemze R', 'Leoni P', 'Leone G', 'Casini M', 'Ricciuti F', 'Vignetti M', 'Beeldens F', 'Mandelli F', 'De Witte T']","[""Department of Hematology, University Tor Vergata, St Eugenio Hospital, P.le dell'Umanesimo, 10, 00144 Rome, Italy. mc7673@mclink.it""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase III', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",20050310,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Adjuvants, Immunologic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '6WS4C399GB (Lenograstim)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adjuvants, Immunologic/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Female', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Lenograstim', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recombinant Proteins/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Survival Analysis']",2005/03/12 09:00,2005/08/02 09:00,['2005/03/12 09:00'],"['2005/03/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/02 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/12 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)53320-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2004-09-3728 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2005 Jul 1;106(1):27-34. doi: 10.1182/blood-2004-09-3728.

Germline PTPN11 mutations underlie about 50% of Noonan syndrome (NS), a developmental disorder that is associated with an elevated risk of juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML). Somatic PTPN11 mutations were recently identified in about 35% of patients with JMML; these mutations introduce amino acid substitutions that are largely distinct from those found in NS. We assessed the functional consequences of leukemia-associated PTPN11 mutations in murine hematopoietic cells. Expressing an E76K SHP-2 protein induced a hypersensitive pattern of granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming unit (CFU-GM) colony growth in response to granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and interleukin 3 (IL-3) that was dependent on SHP-2 catalytic activity. E76K SHP-2 expression also enhanced the growth of immature progenitor cells with high replating potential, perturbed erythroid growth, and impaired normal differentiation in liquid cultures. In addition, leukemia-associated SHP-2 mutations conferred a stronger phenotype than a germline mutation found in patients with NS. Mutant SHP-2 proteins induce aberrant growth in multiple hematopoietic compartments, which supports a primary role of hyperactive Ras in the pathogenesis of JMML.","['Schubbert, Suzanne', 'Lieuw, Kenneth', 'Rowe, Sara L', 'Lee, Connie M', 'Li, Xiaxin', 'Loh, Mignon L', 'Clapp, D Wade', 'Shannon, Kevin M']","['Schubbert S', 'Lieuw K', 'Rowe SL', 'Lee CM', 'Li X', 'Loh ML', 'Clapp DW', 'Shannon KM']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of California at San Francisco, 513 Parnassus Ave, HSE 302, San Francisco, CA 94143, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",20050310,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Ptpn11 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ras Proteins)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Substitution', 'Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/pathology/*physiology', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/*genetics/pathology/physiopathology', 'Liver/cytology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Pregnancy', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases/*genetics', 'ras Proteins/metabolism']",2005/03/12 09:00,2005/08/02 09:00,['2005/03/12 09:00'],"['2005/03/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/02 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/12 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)53357-0 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2004-11-4207 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2005 Jul 1;106(1):311-7. doi: 10.1182/blood-2004-11-4207.

Here we report that prolonged exposure of acute promyelocytic leukemia NB4 cells to low levels of arsenic trioxide increased the expression of a set of genes responsible for reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. We hypothesize that arsenic-induced ROS in turn contribute partially to altered gene expression. To identify genes responsive to arsenic-induced ROS, we used microarray gene expression analysis and identified genes that responded to arsenic and hydrogen peroxide but whose response to arsenic was reversed by an ROS scavenger, N-acetyl-L-cysteine. We found that 26% of the genes significantly responsive to arsenic might have been directly altered by ROS. We further explored the mechanisms by which ROS affects gene regulation and found that the Sp1 transcription factor was oxidized by arsenic treatment, with a corresponding decrease in its in situ binding on the promoters of 3 genes, hTERT, C17, and c-Myc, whose expressions were significantly suppressed. We conclude that ROS contributed partly to arsenic-mediated gene regulation and that Sp1 oxidation contributed to gene suppression by arsenic-induced ROS.","['Chou, Wen-Chien', 'Chen, Hsuan-Yu', 'Yu, Sung-Liang', 'Cheng, Linzhao', 'Yang, Pan-Chyr', 'Dang, Chi V']","['Chou WC', 'Chen HY', 'Yu SL', 'Cheng L', 'Yang PC', 'Dang CV']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei.wchou@ha.mc.ntu.edu.tw']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",20050310,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Blood Proteins)', '0 (CYTL1 protein, human)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MYC protein, human)', '0 (Oxidants)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Sp1 Transcription Factor)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)', 'N712M78A8G (Arsenic)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Arsenic/*pharmacology', 'Blood Proteins/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytokines/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects', 'Glycosylation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/pharmacology', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Oxidants/pharmacology', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/genetics', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Sp1 Transcription Factor/*metabolism', 'Telomerase/genetics']",2005/03/12 09:00,2005/08/02 09:00,['2005/03/12 09:00'],"['2005/03/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/02 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/12 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)53356-9 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2005-01-0241 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2005 Jul 1;106(1):304-10. doi: 10.1182/blood-2005-01-0241.

Studies have consistently shown increased risk for childhood leukemia associated with ELF magnetic fields, whereas ELF fields most likely are not a risk factor for breast cancer and cardiovascular disease. There are still inadequate data for other outcomes. More recently, focus has shifted toward RF exposures from mobile telephony. There are no persuasive data suggesting a health risk, but this research field is still immature with regard to the quantity and quality of available data.

A prerequisite to building such a model is to know the scattering by a single cell in different states. In this paper, a simple model for the high-frequency acoustic scattering by one cell is proposed. A method for deducing the backscatter transfer function from a single, subresolution scatterer is also devised. Using this method, experimental measurements of backscatter from homogeneous, subresolution polystyrene microspheres and single, viable eukaryotic cells, acquired across a broad, continuous range of frequencies were compared with elastic scattering theory and the proposed cell scattering model, respectively. The resonant features observed in the backscatter transfer function of microspheres were found to correspond accurately to theoretical predictions. Using the spacing of the major spectral peaks in the transfer functions obtained experimentally, it is possible to predict microsphere diameters with less than 4% error. Such good agreement was not seen between the cell model and the measured backscatter from cells. Possible reasons for this discrepancy are discussed.","['Baddour, R E', 'Sherar, M D', 'Hunt, J W', 'Czarnota, G J', 'Kolios, M C']","['Baddour RE', 'Sherar MD', 'Hunt JW', 'Czarnota GJ', 'Kolios MC']","['Department of Medical Biophysics, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, M5G2M9, Canada. rbaddour@uhnres.utoronto.ca']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Acoust Soc Am,The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America,7503051,['0 (Polystyrenes)'],IM,"['Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Mathematical Computing', '*Microspheres', 'Models, Theoretical', 'Polystyrenes', '*Radio Waves', '*Scattering, Radiation', 'Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted', 'Transducers', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*physiology', 'Ultrasonography/*instrumentation']",2005/03/12 09:00,2005/07/26 09:00,['2005/03/12 09:00'],"['2005/03/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/26 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/12 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1121/1.1830668 [doi]'],ppublish,J Acoust Soc Am. 2005 Feb;117(2):934-43. doi: 10.1121/1.1830668.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus, in the absence of definitive in vitro models which precisely recapitulate the in vivo setting of human AMLs and failure of significant numbers of new drugs late in clinical trials, it is essential that murine AML models are developed to exploit more specific, targeted therapeutics.

In pursuit of evidence of differences between GPI-AP-normal and -deficient CD34 cells, we determined gene expression profiles of isolated marrow CD34 cells of each phenotype from PNH patients and healthy donors, using DNA microarrays. Pooled and individual patient samples revealed consistent gene expression patterns relative to normal controls. GPI-AP-normal cells from PNH patients showed upregulation of genes involved in apoptosis and the immune response. Conversely, genes associated with antiapoptotic function and hematopoietic cell proliferation and differentiation were downregulated in these cells. In contrast, the PNH clone of GPI-AP-deficient cells appeared more similar to CD34 cells of healthy individuals. Gene chip data were confirmed by other methods. Similar gene expression patterns were present in PNH that was predominantly hemolytic as in PNH associated with aplastic anemia. Our results implicate an environmental influence on hematopoietic cell proliferation, in which the PNH clone evades immune attack and destruction, while normal cells suffer a stress response followed by programmed cell death.","['Chen, G', 'Zeng, W', 'Maciejewski, J P', 'Kcyvanfar, K', 'Billings, E M', 'Young, N S']","['Chen G', 'Zeng W', 'Maciejewski JP', 'Kcyvanfar K', 'Billings EM', 'Young NS']","['Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Glycosylphosphatidylinositols)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (phosphatidylinositol glycan-class A protein)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Apoptosis/*genetics', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Glycosylphosphatidylinositols/genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Hemoglobinuria, Paroxysmal/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Phenotype', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2005/03/11 09:00,2005/06/11 09:00,['2005/03/11 09:00'],"['2005/03/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/11 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/11 09:00 [entrez]']","['2403678 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2403678 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2005 May;19(5):862-8. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403678.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To induce apoptosis, GC bind to the GC receptor (GR), which is regulated by various (co)chaperone proteins such as heat-shock protein 70 (HSP-70), HSP-40, HIP (HSP-70-interacting protein), BAG-1 (BCL-2-associated gene product-1), HOP (HSP-70/HSP-90-Organizing protein), HSP-90, P-23, FKBP-51, FKBP-52 and CYP-40. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that mRNA expression levels of these molecules are determinants of GC resistance in childhood ALL. In all, 20 children with ALL cells in vitro sensitive to prednisolone (LC(50) < 0.1 microg/ml) were compared each with a resistant patient (LC(50) >150 mug/ml), matched for immunophenotype, age and white blood cell count. mRNA expression levels of the (co)chaperone molecules were measured by quantitative real-time RT-PCR and normalized to GAPDH and RNaseP levels. In vitro resistance to prednisolone was measured by MTT assay. HSP-90 mRNA expression levels were 2000-fold higher as compared to HSP-70. Using matched pair analysis, mRNA expression levels of the various (co)chaperone molecules were not significantly different between in vitro-sensitive and -resistant patients. GC resistance in childhood ALL cannot be attributed to different mRNA expression levels of the investigated (co)chaperone molecules involved in GC binding and transport to the nucleus.","['Tissing, W J E', 'Meijerink, J P P', 'den Boer, M L', 'Brinkhof, B', 'Pieters, R']","['Tissing WJ', 'Meijerink JP', 'den Boer ML', 'Brinkhof B', 'Pieters R']","['Division of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Erasmus MC-Sophia Childrens Hospital, University Medical Center Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Molecular Chaperones)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Glucocorticoid)']",IM,"['Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor/methods', 'Glucocorticoids/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins/drug effects/genetics/metabolism', 'HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins/drug effects/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Molecular Chaperones/drug effects/genetics/*metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding/physiology', 'Protein Transport/physiology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Glucocorticoid/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Risk Factors', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",2005/03/11 09:00,2005/06/11 09:00,['2005/03/11 09:00'],"['2005/03/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/11 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/11 09:00 [entrez]']","['2403681 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2403681 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2005 May;19(5):727-33. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403681.,,,,,,,['Leukemia. 2005 May;19(5):710-2.

Racial differences may exist on clinical pictures and the molecular events leading to MDS, which are heterogeneous. To better define the clinical and cytogenetic features in Chinese patients, a retrospective multicentric study was performed in 508 MDS cases.

Little is known about the relationship between chromosomal abnormalities and biological behavior of B-CLL cells in vitro. The present study was designed to explore the impact of chromosomal abnormalities determined by interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) on the in vitro survival and immunogenicity of B-CLL. Considerable heterogeneity was noted in the in vitro survival and expression of costimulatory, adhesion, and antigen-presenting molecules by B-CLL cells. Spontaneous apoptosis of B-CLL cells in vitro was significantly lower in samples with good prognosis cytogenetics when compared to samples with poor prognosis cytogenetics. In contrast, B-CLL cells from samples with good prognosis cytogenetics exhibited higher basal expression of molecules involved in costimulation, cellular adhesion, and antigen presentation, and induced significantly more T-cell proliferation in mixed lymphocyte cultures. We conclude that chromosomal aberrations of B-CLL cells correlate with the in vitro biological behavior of B-CLL. Our data indicate that good prognosis cytogenetics correlates with less spontaneous apoptosis but greater in vitro immunogenicity. These findings could have significant implications on the design of future therapeutic approaches in patients with CLL, and the likelihood of response based on cytogenetics.","['Jahrsdorfer, B', 'Wooldridge, J E', 'Blackwell, S E', 'Taylor, C M', 'Link, B K', 'Weiner, G J']","['Jahrsdorfer B', 'Wooldridge JE', 'Blackwell SE', 'Taylor CM', 'Link BK', 'Weiner GJ']","['Department of Internal Medicine, The Holden Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA 52242, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', 'EC 1.1.1.27 (L-Lactate Dehydrogenase)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Cell Survival/physiology', 'Chromosome Aberrations', '*Cytogenetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence/methods', 'L-Lactate Dehydrogenase/blood', '*Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Phenotype', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2005/03/11 09:00,2005/06/11 09:00,['2005/03/11 09:00'],"['2005/03/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/11 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/11 09:00 [entrez]']","['2403694 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2403694 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2005 May;19(5):759-66. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403694.,,,,"['P50 CA97274/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA77764/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the current study, ZAP-70 and CD38 expressions were examined by flow cytometry in 252 patients with B-CLL. Cytoplasmic ZAP-70 expression in more than 20% (ZAP-70(+)) and surface CD38 expression on more than 30% (CD38(+)) of B-CLL cells were associated with an unfavorable clinical course. The levels of ZAP-70 and CD38 did not change over time in the majority of patients where sequential samples were available for analysis. Combined analysis of ZAP-70 and CD38 yielded discordant results in 73 patients (29.0%), whereas 120 patients (47.6%) were concordantly negative and 59 patients (23.4%) were concordantly positive for ZAP-70 and CD38 expression. Median treatment-free survival times in patients whose leukemic cells were ZAP-70(+)CD38(+) was 30 months as compared to 130 months in patients with a ZAP-70(-)CD38(-) status. In patients with discordant ZAP-70/CD38 results, the median treatment-free survival time was 43 months. Thus, ZAP-70 and CD38 expression analyses provided complementary prognostic information identifying three patient subgroups with good, intermediate and poor prognosis. Over-representation of high-risk genomic aberrations such as 17p deletion or 11q deletion and distribution of the IgV(H) mutation status in B-CLL discordant for ZAP-70/CD38 pointed toward a distinct biologic background of the observed disease subgroups. This finding was also supported by microarray-based gene expression profiling in a subset of 35 patients. The expression of 37 genes differed significantly between the three groups defined by their expression of ZAP-70 and CD38, including genes that are involved in regulation of cell survival and chemotherapy resistance.","['Schroers, R', 'Griesinger, F', 'Trumper, L', 'Haase, D', 'Kulle, B', 'Klein-Hitpass, L', 'Sellmann, L', 'Duhrsen, U', 'Durig, J']","['Schroers R', 'Griesinger F', 'Trumper L', 'Haase D', 'Kulle B', 'Klein-Hitpass L', 'Sellmann L', 'Duhrsen U', 'Durig J']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Georg-August-University Goettingen, Germany. jan.duerig@uni-essen.de']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP70 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (CD38 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase/analysis/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD/analysis/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/analysis/genetics', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence/methods', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/methods', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/analysis/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Survival Analysis', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase']",2005/03/11 09:00,2005/06/11 09:00,['2005/03/11 09:00'],"['2005/03/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/11 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/11 09:00 [entrez]']","['2403707 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2403707 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2005 May;19(5):750-8. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403707.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These lysosomal events occur simultaneously with mitochondrial permeabilization and caspase activation. In U937 cells, blocking mitochondrial permeability transition pore with cyclosporin A and bongkrekic acid reduces mitochondrial and lysosomal rupture, suggesting that lysosomal rupture may be dependent, in part, on mitochondrial disruption. Overexpressing bcl-xL, an antiapoptotic protein known to preserve mitochondrial functions, also impedes lysosomal and mitochondrial disruption in both cell lines, indicating signaling between the two organelles. In addition, no evidence was obtained of bcl-2-like proteins targeting lysosomes. Caspase activities, including caspase-2L, are required for lysosomal and mitochondrial disruption, and lysosomal cathepsin B slightly participates in apoptosis propagation after CPT, although not essential for apoptosis activation. Our study provides evidence for the participation of a lysosomal pathway during DNA damage-induced cell death. Our data suggest that caspase activation and mitochondrial disruption represent cell-context-specific mechanisms by which DNA damage leads to lysosomal rupture, and that lysosomal cathepsins could slightly participate in apoptosis propagation after CPT.","['Paquet, C', 'Sane, A-T', 'Beauchemin, M', 'Bertrand, R']","['Paquet C', 'Sane AT', 'Beauchemin M', 'Bertrand R']","[""Centre de recherche, Centre hospitalier de l'Universite of Montreal (CHUM) -Hopital Notre-Dame and Institut du cancer de Montreal, Canada.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '11076-19-0 (Bongkrekic Acid)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'EC 3.4.22.1 (Cathepsin B)', 'XT3Z54Z28A (Camptothecin)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Bongkrekic Acid/pharmacology', 'Camptothecin/pharmacology', 'Caspases/drug effects/metabolism/*physiology', 'Cathepsin B/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclosporine/pharmacology', 'DNA Damage/drug effects/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Lysosomes/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/metabolism/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics', 'Time Factors', 'U937 Cells', 'bcl-X Protein']",2005/03/11 09:00,2005/06/11 09:00,['2005/03/11 09:00'],"['2005/03/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/11 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/11 09:00 [entrez]']","['2403717 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2403717 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2005 May;19(5):784-91. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403717.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Genesis of many tumors relates with functional disorder and abnormal expressions of Fas and FasL. This study was designed to detect protein expressions of Fas and FasL in B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (B-NHL) and benign lymphoid tissue, and to provide new markers for diagnosis of lymphoma. METHODS: Immunohistochemistry was used to detect protein expressions of Fas and FasL in 92 specimens of B-NHL, and 20 specimens of benign lymphoid tissue. RESULTS: Fas mostly expressed on membrane. FasL mostly expressed in cytoplasm, and partially expressed in nuclei. Positive rate of Fas in B-NHL was 66.3% (61/92), and that of FasL in B-NHL was 67.4% (62/92). Positive rates of both Fas and FasL in benign lymphoid tissue were 60.0% (12/20). There was no significant difference in expressions of Fas and FasL between B-NHL group and benign group (P>0.05), but positive locations of Fas and FasL in these 2 groups are different. Positive rates of Fas and FasL were higher in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBL) than in follicular lymphoma (FL), and small cell lymphoma (SLL) (87.2% vs. 64.5%, and 31.8%, P<0.05u 89.7% vs. 67.7%, and 27.3%, P<0.05). Positive rates of Fas and FasL in FL were higher than those in SLL. No correlation was found between Fas/FasL expression and patients' gender, age, and tumor location. CONCLUSIONS: The expressions of Fas and FasL are not useful for distinguishing benign lymphoid tissue from lymphoma tissue, while their locational characteristics are valuable for differential diagnosis. The expressions of Fas and FasL are considered valuable in evaluating the malignant grade of B-NHL.","['Jin, Yi', 'Li, Ying-Chun', 'Su, Zu-Lan', 'Tang, Lu-Ying', 'Feng, Zhi-Ying', 'Guo, Shao-Zhong']","['Jin Y', 'Li YC', 'Su ZL', 'Tang LY', 'Feng ZY', 'Guo SZ']","['Department of Pathology, The Third Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 510630, P.R.China.']",['chi'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,China,Ai Zheng,Ai zheng = Aizheng = Chinese journal of cancer,9424852,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (FASLG protein, human)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factors)', '0 (fas Receptor)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Fas Ligand Protein', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell', 'Lymphadenitis/metabolism', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*metabolism', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/*metabolism', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Tumor Necrosis Factors/*metabolism', 'fas Receptor/*metabolism']",2005/03/11 09:00,2006/07/06 09:00,['2005/03/11 09:00'],"['2005/03/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/07/06 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/11 09:00 [entrez]']",['1000467X2005030332 [pii]'],ppublish,Ai Zheng. 2005 Mar;24(3):332-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Both coexist and have become the subject of intense investigation. In haematological neoplasias, distinct sets of genes, including the p15/INK4b cell cycle inhibitor (mostly in myeloid malignancies) as well as p16/INK4a (only very infrequently in myeloid neoplasia), have been well characterised as to incidence of hypermethylation, concurrent gene inactivation and their re-expression following treatment with DNA methylation inhibitors. Several genes frequently methylated in haematological neoplasias have been studied with respect to their prognostic value. With the advance of low-dose schedules of demethylating agents (explored particularly in the elderly patient population) the rationale for reverting the 'hyper-methylator phenotype' has also prompted in vivo studies of gene reactivation following this type of treatment. However, ubiquitous surrogate markers for the efficacy of this type of treatment need to be developed. These may include reactivated haemoglobin F (HbF), as demethylating agents can result in clinically meaningful induction of HbF in patients with haemoglobinopathies. Because 'cancer testis antigens', which provide powerful signals for T cell cytotoxic activity on solid tumour cells, are usually silenced in leukaemia but can be reactivated in vitro and in vivo, they provide a rationale for an immuno-modulatory effect of demethylating therapy.","['Hackanson, Bjorn', 'Guo, Yalin', 'Lubbert, Michael']","['Hackanson B', 'Guo Y', 'Lubbert M']","['University of Freiburg Medical Center, Department of Hematology/Oncology, 79106 Freiburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,England,Expert Opin Ther Targets,Expert opinion on therapeutic targets,101127833,,IM,"['DNA Methylation', 'Epigenesis, Genetic/*genetics/physiology', 'Gene Silencing/*physiology', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans']",2005/03/11 09:00,2006/06/02 09:00,['2005/03/11 09:00'],"['2005/03/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/06/02 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/11 09:00 [entrez]']","['ETT090103 [pii]', '10.1517/14728222.9.1.45 [doi]']",ppublish,Expert Opin Ther Targets. 2005 Feb;9(1):45-61. doi: 10.1517/14728222.9.1.45.,152,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Mean bone marrow doses were calculated for ten patients with localized prostate cancer who underwent whole-pelvis IMRT and compared to three-dimensional conformal (3-D CRT) plans prepared for the same patients. Also for comparison, the IMRT and 3-D CRT plans were produced to simulate the treatment of the prostate gland only. To measure the dose to extrapelvic bone marrow, three thermoluminescent diode (TLD) chips were placed in the middle of the sternum region inside the Rando phantom. RESULTS: For both the pelvic and prostate-only volumes, the IMRT plans were superior to 3-D CRT plans in reducing the high dose volume to the rectum, the bladder and the small bowel while maintaining acceptable coverage of the planning target volume (PTV). For the pelvic treatment group the IMRT plans, compared to 3-D CRT, reduced the high dose volume (> 20 Gy) to os coxae, which is the main contributor of dose to pelvic bone marrow, but increased the middle dose volume (10-20 Gy). No statistically significant differences were observed for lower dose volumes (< 5 Gy). For the prostate-only treatment the IMRT plan increased the high dose volume and slightly decreased the low dose volume of pelvic bone marrow. However, for both treatments the leakage dose to extrapelvic sites was higher by a factor of 2 in IMRT plans. CONCLUSION: There are significant differences in the dose-volume histograms of bone marrow doses from 3-D CRT and from IMRT. Pronounced dose inhomogeneity reduces the risk of leukemia compared to homogeneous radiation exposure of the bone marrow. The mean bone marrow dose is therefore not a useful criterion to judge plan quality, since scattered low doses to distant sites may be more critical than the high dose volumes receiving > 10 Gy. The number of monitor units needed to deliver an IMRT plan affects leakage dose and their incorporation into planning constraints should be considered.","['Gershkevitsh, Eduard', 'Clark, Catharine H', 'Staffurth, John', 'Dearnaley, David P', 'Trott, Klaus-Rudiger']","['Gershkevitsh E', 'Clark CH', 'Staffurth J', 'Dearnaley DP', 'Trott KR']","['Department of Radiotherapy, Cancer Center, North-Estonian Regional Hospital, Tallinn, Estonia. eduardger@yahoo.co.uk']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Germany,Strahlenther Onkol,Strahlentherapie und Onkologie : Organ der Deutschen Rontgengesellschaft ...

Ponicidin has been reported to have anti-tumor effects on a large variety of malignant diseases. In this study, we investigated the anti-proliferation effects of ponicidin on human myeloid K562 and HL-60 cells. Cell viability was measured by MTT assay; cell apoptosis was assessed by flow cytometry, DNA fragmentation analysis and Hoechst 33258 staining. Caspase-3 and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) activation and Bax and Bcl-2 expression were detected by Western blot analysis. The results revealed that ponicidin could significantly inhibit the growth of K562 and HL-60 cells by induction of apoptosis. The suppression was both time- and dose-dependent. Cell apoptosis was observed clearly after the cells were treated with ponicidin for 48-72 h. Western blotting showed cleavage of the caspase-3 zymogen protein (32 kDa) with the appearance of its 17 kDa subunit, together with a cleaved 89-kDa fragment of 116 kDa PARP when apoptosis occurred. Bcl-2 expression was down-regulated while Bax expression up-regulated concurrently when the cells were treated with ponicidin for 24-48 h. Therefore, we conclude that ponicidin has significant anti-proliferation effects by induction of apoptosis on myeloid leukemia cells in vitro, down-regulation of Bcl-2, and up-regulation of Bax, and that activation of caspase-3 and PARP may be an important apoptosis-inducing mechanism. The results suggest that ponicidin may serve as a potential therapeutic agent for leukemia.","['Liu, Jia-Jun', 'Huang, Ren-Wei', 'Lin, Dong-Jun', 'Wu, Xiang-Yuan', 'Lin, Qu', 'Peng, Jun', 'Pan, Xianglin', 'Song, Yu-Qin', 'Zhang, Mao-Hong', 'Hou, Ming', 'Chen, Feng']","['Liu JJ', 'Huang RW', 'Lin DJ', 'Wu XY', 'Lin Q', 'Peng J', 'Pan X', 'Song YQ', 'Zhang MH', 'Hou M', 'Chen F']","['Sun Yat-sen University, Department of Haematology and Oncology, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Tian-He Road 600, Guangzhou, Guangdong 510630, PR China. liujj@gzsums.edu.cn']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Greece,Oncol Rep,Oncology reports,9422756,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (Diterpenes)', '0 (Drugs, Chinese Herbal)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '52617-37-5 (ponicidin)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'LHQ7J5KV9B (Bisbenzimidazole)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Bisbenzimidazole/pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'Diterpenes/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Down-Regulation', 'Drugs, Chinese Herbal', 'Flow Cytometry', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Models, Chemical', 'Plant Extracts/pharmacology', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/biosynthesis', 'Time Factors', 'Up-Regulation', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein']",2005/03/10 09:00,2005/08/27 09:00,['2005/03/10 09:00'],"['2005/03/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/27 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/10 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncol Rep. 2005 Apr;13(4):653-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sufficient data from 91 epidemiologic studies were available to examine the dose response of relative risk and level of NSAID intake for ten human malignancies. Dose response curves were fitted by exponential regression. Results showed a significant exponential decline in the risk with increasing intake of NSAIDs (primarily aspirin or ibuprofen) for 7-10 malignancies including the four major types: colon, breast, lung, and prostate cancer. Daily intake of NSAIDs, primarily aspirin, produced risk reductions of 63% for colon, 39% for breast, 36% for lung, and 39% for prostate cancer. Significant risk reductions were also observed for esophageal (73%), stomach (62%), and ovarian cancer (47%). NSAID effects became apparent after five or more years of use and were stronger with longer duration. Observed protective effects were also consistently stronger for gastrointestinal malignancies (esophagus, stomach, and colon). Results for pancreatic, urinary bladder, and renal cancer were inconsistent. Initial epidemiologic studies of malignant melanoma, Hodgkin's disease, and adult leukemia also found that NSAIDs are protective. A few studies suggest that ibuprofen has stronger anticancer effects than aspirin, particularly against breast and lung cancer. Overexpression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and increased prostaglandin biosynthesis correlates with carcinogenesis and metastasis at most anatomic sites. Preclinical investigations provide consistent evidence that both selective and non-selective NSAIDs effectively inhibit chemically-induced carcinogenesis of epithelial tumors. This review provides compelling and converging evidence that regular intake of NSAIDs that non-selectively block COX-2 protects against the development of many types of cancer.","['Harris, Randall E', 'Beebe-Donk, Joanne', 'Doss, Hani', 'Burr Doss, Deborah']","['Harris RE', 'Beebe-Donk J', 'Doss H', 'Burr Doss D']","['College of Medicine and Public Health, The Ohio State University, 320 West 10th Avenue, Columbus, OH 43210-1240, USA. harris.44@osu.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Greece,Oncol Rep,Oncology reports,9422756,"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal)', '0 (Anticarcinogenic Agents)', '0 (Cyclooxygenase 2 Inhibitors)', '0 (Cyclooxygenase Inhibitors)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (Cyclooxygenase 1)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (Cyclooxygenase 2)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (PTGS1 protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (PTGS2 protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthases)', 'R16CO5Y76E (Aspirin)', 'WK2XYI10QM (Ibuprofen)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/*pharmacology', 'Anticarcinogenic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Aspirin/*pharmacology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cyclooxygenase 1', 'Cyclooxygenase 2', 'Cyclooxygenase 2 Inhibitors', 'Cyclooxygenase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Ibuprofen/*pharmacology', 'Male', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Models, Biological', 'Neoplasms/*prevention & control', 'Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthases/*metabolism', 'Risk', 'Time Factors']",2005/03/10 09:00,2005/08/27 09:00,['2005/03/10 09:00'],"['2005/03/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/27 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/10 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncol Rep. 2005 Apr;13(4):559-83.,264,,,,,,['J Urol. 2005 Aug;174(2):787-8.

The long isoform with b-catenin binding domain functions as a transcriptional enhancer factor. The short isoform derives from an intronic promoter and exhibits dominant negative activity. Recently, alterations of LEF-1 isoforms distribution have been described in colon cancer. In the current study we employed a quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR method (TaqMan) to analyze expression of LEF-1 isoforms in a large cohort of human tumor (n = 304) and tumor-free control samples (n = 56). The highest expression level of LEF-1 was found in carcinoma samples whereas brain cancer samples expressed little. Expression of LEF-1 was different in distinct cancer types. For example, the mRNA level of LEF-1 was lower in testicular tumor samples compared with tumor-free control samples. Besides epithelial cancers, significant LEF-1 expression was also found in hematopoietic cells. In hematological malignancies, overall LEF-1 level was higher in lymphocytic leukemias compared with myeloid leukemias and normal hematopoiesis. However, acute myeloid leukemia and acute lymphocytic leukemia showed a significantly increased fraction of the oncogenic LEF-1 compared with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and chronic myeloid leukemia. Taken together, these data suggest that LEF-1 is abundantly expressed in human tumors and the ratio of the oncogenic and the dominant negative short isoform altered not only in carcinomas but also in leukemia.","['Wang, Wenbing', 'Ji, Ping', 'Steffen, Bjorn', 'Metzger, Ralf', 'Schneider, Paul M', 'Halfter, Hartmut', 'Schrader, Mark', 'Berdel, Wolfgang E', 'Serve, Hubert', 'Muller-Tidow, Carsten']","['Wang W', 'Ji P', 'Steffen B', 'Metzger R', 'Schneider PM', 'Halfter H', 'Schrader M', 'Berdel WE', 'Serve H', 'Muller-Tidow C']","['Institute of Life Sciences, Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, China.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Controlled Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,China,Acta Biochim Biophys Sin (Shanghai),Acta biochimica et biophysica Sinica,101206716,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (LEF1 protein, human)', '0 (Lymphoid Enhancer-Binding Factor 1)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/*metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', '*Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics/metabolism', 'Lymphoid Enhancer-Binding Factor 1', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Neoplasms/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Isoforms/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism']",2005/03/10 09:00,2005/07/28 09:00,['2005/03/10 09:00'],"['2005/03/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/28 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/10 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Acta Biochim Biophys Sin (Shanghai). 2005 Mar;37(3):173-80.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

BNIP3 is a proapoptotic member of the Bcl-2 protein family involved in hypoxia-induced cell death. We evaluated the expression and methylation status of BNIP3 gene to better understand the role of epigenetic alteration of its expression in haematopoietic tumours. Methylation of the region around the BNIP3 transcription start site was detected in four acute lymphocytic leukaemia, one multiple myeloma and one Burkitt lymphoma cell lines, and was closely associated with silencing the gene. That expression of BNIP3 was restored by treatment with 5-aza2'-deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC), a methyltransferase inhibitor, which confirmed the gene to be epigenetically inactivated by methylation. Notably, re-expression of BNIP3 using 5-aza2-dC also restored hypoxia-mediated cell death in methylated cell lines. Acetylation of histone H3 in the 5' region of the gene, which was assessed using chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, correlated directly with gene expression and inversely with DNA methylation. Among primary tumours, methylation of BNIP3 was detected in five of 34 (15%) acute lymphocytic leukaemias, six of 35 (17%) acute myelogenous leukaemias and three of 14 (21%) multiple myelomas. These results suggest that aberrant DNA methylation of the 5' CpG island and histone deacetylation play key roles in silencing BNIP3 expression in haematopoietic tumours.","['Murai, M', 'Toyota, M', 'Satoh, A', 'Suzuki, H', 'Akino, K', 'Mita, H', 'Sasaki, Y', 'Ishida, T', 'Shen, L', 'Garcia-Manero, G', 'Issa, J-P J', 'Hinoda, Y', 'Tokino, T', 'Imai, K']","['Murai M', 'Toyota M', 'Satoh A', 'Suzuki H', 'Akino K', 'Mita H', 'Sasaki Y', 'Ishida T', 'Shen L', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Issa JP', 'Hinoda Y', 'Tokino T', 'Imai K']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Sapporo Medical University, Sapporo 060-8556, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (BNIP3 protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'CpG Islands', '*DNA Methylation', '*Gene Silencing', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Membrane Proteins/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics']",2005/03/10 09:00,2005/04/29 09:00,['2005/03/10 09:00'],"['2005/03/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/29 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['6602422 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.bjc.6602422 [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 2005 Mar 28;92(6):1165-72. doi: 10.1038/sj.bjc.6602422.,,,,,PMC2361956,,,,,,,,,,,,

Avicins induce apoptosis in Jurkat T leukemia cells by targeting mitochondria and release of cytochrome c that occurs in a p53-independent manner. However, postmitochondrial antiapoptotic barriers, such as increased expression of heat shock proteins (Hsp) and X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (XIAP), frequently exist in cancer cells and often account for resistance to chemotherapy and a poor prognosis. In this article, we show the role of avicins in the activation of stress-regulated ubiquitination and degradation of Hsp70 and XIAP. This is the first report showing the regulation of Hsp70 via the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway. We also show the induction of E3alpha ubiquitin ligase in avicin-treated Jurkat T leukemia cells, and its involvement in the degradation of XIAP. Avicin-mediated suppression of Hsp70 and XIAP was further confirmed in other leukemic/lymphoma cell lines and freshly isolated peripheral blood lymphocytes from Sezary syndrome patients. No change in the Hsp70 and XIAP proteins was observed in peripheral blood lymphocytes from normal donors. We propose that the ability of avicins to induce ubiquitination and regulate the degradation of Hsp70 and XIAP in leukemia cells could have important implications in the treatment of drug-resistant neoplasia and inflammatory disorders.","['Gaikwad, Amos', 'Poblenz, Ann', 'Haridas, Valsala', 'Zhang, Chunlei', 'Duvic, Madeleine', 'Gutterman, Jordan']","['Gaikwad A', 'Poblenz A', 'Haridas V', 'Zhang C', 'Duvic M', 'Gutterman J']","['Department of Molecular Therapeutics, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Boulevard, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Triterpenes)', '0 (Ubiquitins)', '0 (X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein)', '0 (XIAP protein, human)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Blotting, Western', 'HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Lymphoma/*pathology', 'Proteins/*metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sezary Syndrome/*pathology', 'Triterpenes/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Ubiquitins', 'X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein']",2005/03/10 09:00,2005/06/21 09:00,['2005/03/10 09:00'],"['2005/03/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/21 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['11/5/1953 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-04-1704 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2005 Mar 1;11(5):1953-62. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-04-1704.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Randomized double-blind placebo-controlled phase II clinical trial. Eligible patients had solid tumors for which treatment with carboplatin/paclitaxel was appropriate. The primary end point was a standardized composite peripheral nerve electrophysiology (CPNE) score, based on nerve velocities and amplitudes, measured at baseline and after four cycles of chemotherapy. Secondary efficacy end points included CPNE score at last cycle and at exit evaluation, vibration perception threshold, H-reflex latency, symptom scores, and quantitative assessment of neurologic signs. Study drug was given s.c. daily for 7 days starting the day before chemotherapy. Patients were randomized to receive low-dose rhuLIF (2 microg/kg), high-dose rhuLIF (4 microg/kg), or placebo. RESULTS: Patients (n = 117) were randomized across seven neurology test centers. Thirty-six patients received low dose rhuLIF (2 microg/kg), 39 received high dose rhuLIF (4 microg/kg) and 42 received placebo. rhuLIF was well tolerated with 95% compliance and no adverse effects on quality of life. No differences between groups in CPNE or any of the individual neurologic testing variables were observed between baseline and cycle 4 or by the secondary efficacy variables. CONCLUSIONS: rhuLIF is not effective in preventing CIPN caused by carboplatin and paclitaxel.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Raltitrexed was administered as a 15-minute infusion for 3 consecutive weeks every 5 weeks, at doses ranging from 1.3 to 2.8 mg/m(2). The first course was used to determine the dose-limiting toxicities and maximum tolerated dose. Correlative studies included an assessment of raltitrexed pharmacokinetics and measurement of plasma 2'-deoxyuridine concentrations, a surrogate measure of thymidylate synthase inhibition. RESULTS: Twenty-one children (18 evaluable) with refractory leukemia received 25 courses of raltitrexed. The dose-limiting toxicity was reversible elevation in liver transaminases at the 2.8-mg/m(2) dose level and the maximum tolerated dose was 2.1 mg/m(2) per dose. Pharmacokinetics were best characterized by a two-compartment model with a clearance of 139 mL/min/m(2) (8.3 L/h/m(2)), a 2.4-L volume of distribution, an initial half-life (t(1/2alpha)) of 6 minutes, and a terminal half-life (t(1/2beta)) of 45 minutes.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Mutational analysis of CEBPalpha with direct sequencing for each PCR product was done on matched bone marrow samples obtained from 50 adult patients with MDS at diagnosis and at AML transformation. Cloning analysis was used to determine the allelic distribution. RESULTS: CEBPalpha mutations were identified in four patients at diagnosis of MDS, including one with refractory anemia with excess blasts and three with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. At AML transformation, three patients retained the identical mutant clones as their initial diagnosis, three acquired the mutations, and one lost CEBPalpha mutation when she gained FLT3/ITD mutation. Together, seven patients had CEBPalpha mutations throughout the disease course; four patients had NH(2)-terminal mutations resulting in a frameshift and truncation of the protein, three of them had two different mutations either on the same alleles or on different alleles, two had missense mutations, and one had a deletion in the basic region leucine zipper domain. Except for one with coexistence of N-ras mutation, no sample harbored cooperating mutations with FLT3 or N-ras genes. CEBPalpha mutations had no influence on the time to AML progression or overall survival.

Plasma and serum IL-6 levels have been associated with prostate cancer progression in several small studies. In order to evaluate its prognostic significance in metastatic HRCaP patients, we measured IL-6 in plasma collected at baseline from patients in a large cooperative group study [Cancer and Leukemia Group B 9480 (CALGB 9480)]. METHODS: 191 patients entered on CALGB 9480 had pretreatment plasma collected and centrally stored. Using a human IL-6 immunoassay, quantitative levels of IL-6 were measured in duplicate on 300 muL samples. The proportional hazard model was used to assess the prognostic significance of IL-6 in predicting overall survival. RESULTS: Median IL-6 level for the cohort of 191 patients was 4.80 pg/mL. Survival time among patients with IL-6 levels less than or equal to the median was 19 months (95% CI, 17-22) compared with 11 (95% CI, 8-14) months for patients above the median (P = 0.0004). In multivariate analysis, adjusting on performance status, lactate dehydrogenase, and prostate-specific antigen level, the hazard ratio was 1.38 (95% CI, 1.01-1.89; P = 0.043) using the median level as a cut point. Furthermore, a cut point of 13.31 pg/mL revealed robust prognostic significance with a hazard ratio of 2.02 (95% CI, 1.36-2.98; P = 0.0005).

However, the antigenic basis of this selective GVL response remains enigmatic, because no H-Y antigens with hematopoietic-restricted expression were identified. In this study, we report a novel H-Y epitope that is preferentially recognized on activated proliferating lymphocytes. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We generated a CTL clone YKIII.8 that showed reactivity toward male B*5201+ CD40-activated B cells, EBV-lymphoblastoid cell lines, and phytohemagglutinin-activated T-cell blasts but little or no reactivity toward fibroblasts, CD14+ cells, or unstimulated B and T cells. The antigen recognized by YKIII.8 was identified by screening of a cDNA expression library, and its pattern of expression was investigated. RESULTS: cDNA of the male isoform of 40S ribosomal protein S4 was found to encode the antigenic peptide TIRYPDPVI, which was recognized by YKIII.8.

In mouse models of leukemia produced by Hoxa9, Meis1 accelerates leukemogenesis. Because Hoxa9 immortalizes myeloid progenitors in the absence of Meis1 expression, the contribution of Meis1 toward leukemia remains unclear. Here, we describe a cultured progenitor model in which Meis1 programs leukemogenicity. Progenitors immortalized by Hoxa9 in culture are myeloid-lineage restricted and only infrequently caused leukemia after more than 250 days. Coexpressed Meis1 programmed rapid AML-initiating character, maintained multipotent progenitor potential, and induced expression of genes associated with short-term hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), such as FLT3 and CD34, whose expression also characterizes the leukemia-initiating stem cells of human AML. Meis1 leukemogenesis functions required binding to Pbx, binding to DNA, and a conserved function of its C-terminal tail. We hypothesize that Meis1 is required for the homing and survival of leukemic progenitors within their hematopoietic niches, functions mediated by HSC-specific genes such as CD34 and Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3), respectively. This is the first example of a transcription factor oncoprotein (Meis1) that establishes expression of a tyrosine kinase oncoprotein (FLT3), and explains their coexpression in human leukemia. This cultured progenitor model will be useful to define the genetic basis of leukemogenesis involving Hoxa9 and Meis1.","['Wang, Gang G', 'Pasillas, Martina P', 'Kamps, Mark P']","['Wang GG', 'Pasillas MP', 'Kamps MP']","['Department of Pathology and Molecular Pathology Program, School of Medicine, University of California at San Diego, 9500 Gilman Drive, La Jolla, CA 92093, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",20050308,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (MEIS1 protein, human)', '0 (Meis1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-7)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (homeobox protein HOXA9)', '67256-21-7 (Hepatocyte Growth Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Flt3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Cell Division/physiology', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cell Lineage/physiology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*physiology', 'Hepatocyte Growth Factor/pharmacology', 'Homeodomain Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/*physiopathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Phenotype', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*genetics', 'Receptors, Interleukin-7/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic/physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3']",2005/03/10 09:00,2005/08/02 09:00,['2005/03/10 09:00'],"['2005/03/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/02 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)53351-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2004-12-4664 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2005 Jul 1;106(1):254-64. doi: 10.1182/blood-2004-12-4664.

Within 14 months, all of the mice died of either leukemic transformation or severe anemia and leucopenia as a result of progressive MDS. The NUP98-HOXD13 fusion gene inhibits megakaryocytic differentiation and increases apoptosis in the bone marrow, suggesting a mechanism leading to ineffective hematopoiesis in the presence of a hypercellular bone marrow.

Surprisingly, we found that A91V perforin was expressed at reduced levels compared with wild-type perforin, resulting in partial loss of lytic capacity. In contrast, expression and function of N252S-substituted perforin were normal. Most HLH-associated mutations resulted in protein degradation (probably due to misfolding) and complete loss of perforin activity, the exception being R232H, which retained approximately 30% wild-type activity. Several other mutated proteins (H222Q, C73R, F157V, and D313V) had no detectable lytic activity but were expressed at normal levels, suggesting that their functional defect might map downstream at the level of the target cell membrane.

We demonstrate that both Syt I and Syt II travel through the plasma membrane and require endocytosis to reach their final intracellular localization. However, N- or C-terminal tagging of Syt II, but not of Syt I, prevents its internalization, trapping the tagged protein at the plasma membrane. Furthermore, a chimeric protein comprising a tagged luminal domain of Syt II fused with the remaining domains of Syt I also localizes to the plasma membrane, whereas a chimera consisting of tagged luminal domain of Syt I fused with Syt II colocalizes with Syt I on secretory granules. We also show that endocytosis of both Syt I and Syt II is strictly dependent on O-glycosylation processing, whereby O-glycosylation mutants of either protein fail to internalize and remain at the plasma membrane. Our results indicate that the luminal domains of Syt I and Syt II govern their internalization capacity from the plasma membrane and identify O-glycosylation as playing a crucial role in Syt trafficking in non-neuronal secretory cells.","['Atiya-Nasagi, Yafit', 'Cohen, Hila', 'Medalia, Ora', 'Fukudan, Mitsunori', 'Sagi-Eisenberg, Ronit']","['Atiya-Nasagi Y', 'Cohen H', 'Medalia O', 'Fukudan M', 'Sagi-Eisenberg R']","['Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv 69978, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20050308,England,J Cell Sci,Journal of cell science,0052457,"['0 (Calcium-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Synaptotagmin II)', '0 (Syt2 protein, rat)', '134193-27-4 (Synaptotagmins)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Calcium-Binding Proteins/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Endocytosis/physiology', 'Glycosylation', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/chemistry/metabolism', 'Mast Cells/*metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/metabolism', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary/physiology', 'Protein Transport/physiology', 'Rats', 'Secretory Vesicles/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Synaptotagmin II', 'Synaptotagmins']",2005/03/10 09:00,2005/10/26 09:00,['2005/03/10 09:00'],"['2005/03/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/10/26 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['jcs.01710 [pii]', '10.1242/jcs.01710 [doi]']",ppublish,J Cell Sci. 2005 Apr 1;118(Pt 7):1363-72. doi: 10.1242/jcs.01710.

By using a complementary set of deletion mutants, we report here that the nuclear targeting of HBZ is mediated by three distinct nuclear localization signals and that at least two are necessary for the translocation of HBZ to the nucleus. Moreover, the resulting mutant proteins distribute throughout the nucleoplasm and/or into the nucleoli, whereas the wild-type HBZ exclusively accumulates in nuclear speckles, suggesting that the integrity of the protein is required for its speckle localization. We also demonstrate that the HBZ-containing speckles do not correspond to Cajal bodies, splicing factor compartments, or promyelocytic leukemia oncoprotein bodies.

To examine pathologic and clinical significance of the p15 gene inactivation, we established a quantitative assay of p15 mRNA expression in the bone marrow cells by real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. p15 mRNA expression in 14 patients with precursor B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (PBC-ALL) well correlated with status of deletion and methylation in the p15 gene analyzed by Southern blotting. Furthermore, two patients with PBC-ALL and 11 acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) were quantitatively examined for p15 gene methylation using bisulfite genomic sequencing. The data showed that p15 mRNA expression significantly correlated with the CpG island methylation density. Among 108 AML patients, p15 mRNA expression was significantly lower in the myeloid lineage (M1, M2, M3) than the monocytic lineage (M4, M5) (P = 0.0019). Above all, the majority of M3 patients showed low p15 expression compared with M1 and M2 patients (P = 0.029).

Recent studies have provided evidence for diagnostic alternatives to invasive procedures and more therapeutic options for the management of this complication. In order to put diagnostic criteria and methodological approach to the disease into the perspective of developing strategies for therapy, all relevant studies published in the English literature over the last 30 years were examined. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The English-language articles located through MEDLINE (1966 to present) and from selected bibliographies. RESULTS: There is increased recognition of CDC as complication of treatment with chemotherapy in patients with acute leukemia. Liver biopsy may not always be revealing or feasible to perform in some patients. Among the imaging modalities, magnetic resonance imaging has obtained preeminence as a non-invasive tool for the diagnosis of hepatosplenic fungal infections. Administration of amphotericin B (Amp B) in relatively large cumulative doses is needed to ensure appropriate control of the infection and prevention of future relapse. Patients intolerant of, or refractory to conventional Amp B have been successfully salvaged using fluconazole or lipid formulations of Amp B. A constellation of clinical, laboratory and radiologic parameters should be used to determine response and efficacy of therapy. There is sufficient evidence to support the safety and feasibility of continuing chemotherapy for acute leukemia in conjunction with antifungal treatment in patients diagnosed with CDC. CONCLUSION: The development of CDC in patients with acute leukemia does not preclude further chemotherapy or constitute contraindication for bone marrow transplantation. Knowledge of the course and pattern of evolution of the disease and adopting aggressive therapeutic approach will likely reduce the morbidity and mortality from this complication.","['Masood, Aisha', 'Sallah, Sabah']","['Masood A', 'Sallah S']","['Divison of Hematology/Oncology, Louisiana State University, 1501 Kings Highway, Shreveport, LA 71119, USA. ashus3@aol.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Review']",20041230,England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '7XU7A7DROE (Amphotericin B)', '8VZV102JFY (Fluconazole)']",IM,"['Amphotericin B/administration & dosage', 'Antifungal Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Candidiasis/*etiology', 'Chronic Disease', 'Fluconazole/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*complications/drug therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications/drug therapy', 'Salvage Therapy', 'Time Factors']",2005/03/10 09:00,2005/06/09 09:00,['2005/03/10 09:00'],"['2004/06/21 00:00 [received]', '2004/10/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/03/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/09 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0145-2126(04)00374-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2004.10.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2005 May;29(5):493-501. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2004.10.003.

Although few doubt the association of thrombocytosis with increased risk for life-threatening events such as thrombosis or hemorrhage, or the association between clonal myeloproliferation and the progression to acute leukemia or myelofibrosis, controversy exists regarding the timing and nature of appropriate therapeutic intervention. Studies have shown that treatment with myelosuppressive agents such as chlorambucil, busulfan, radiophosphorus (32P), and hydroxyurea reduces the platelet count. However, investigators have also identified an increased risk of drug-related leukemic transformation. An ideal cytoreductive treatment for long-term use should minimize thrombosis and avoid long-term complications, especially acute leukemia (AL). Anagrelide, an imidazoquinolin, inhibits megakaryopoiesis and more selectively reduces platelet production in humans. A retrospective analysis of an open-label, multicenter, international trial reviewing 3660 anagrelide-treated patients was performed to assess efficacy and long-term safety, specifically potential for increased leukemogenicity. The study included MPD patients with thrombocytosis diagnosed according to Polycythemia Vera Study Group (PVSG) criteria. Of all patients enrolled, 81% had previously received other myelosuppressive agents; of these, 33% were transferred from the original agent to anagrelide due to toxicity and 31% were transferred because of poor platelet control. Over 45% of patients were symptomatic due to thrombocythemia, most commonly vascular sequelae (25%). Dosage was titrated to achieve a platelet count < 600 x 10(9) L(-1) and ideally between 130 and 450 x 10(9) L(-1). The safety cohort of 3660 patients, including 2251 with essential thrombocythemia (ET), 462 with polycythemia vera (PV), and 947 with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and other MPDs, was analyzed to establish the incidence of leukemic transformation in patients with ET and PV. From the Safety Population, 12.8% (467/3660) of patients were treated with anagrelide as the sole cytoreductive agent (naive patients). Acute leukemia/myelodysplasia developed in 2.1% of ET patients (47/2251) with a maximum follow-up of 7.1 years. Of the PV patients, 2.8% developed acute leukemia/myelodysplastic syndrome (13/462), with a maximum follow-up of 7.0 years. ET and PV patients who transformed to AL had all been previously exposed to other cytotoxics; there were no ET or PV patients in the study who transformed to AL exposed solely to anagrelide. With maximum follow-up over 7 years, anagrelide achieved platelet control in over 75% of MPD patients and did not increase the conversion to acute leukemia during the treatment duration analyzed. Longer follow-up is required to confirm these important observations regarding the long-term safety of anagrelide.","['Fruchtman, Steven M', 'Petitt, Robert M', 'Gilbert, Harriet S', 'Fiddler, Garrick', 'Lyne, Andrew']","['Fruchtman SM', 'Petitt RM', 'Gilbert HS', 'Fiddler G', 'Lyne A']","['Mount Sinai Medical Center, New York, NY 10029, USA. steven.fruchtman@mssm.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20050121,England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors)', '0 (Quinazolines)', 'K9X45X0051 (anagrelide)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Blood Platelets/drug effects/metabolism', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Quinazolines/*therapeutic use', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Safety', 'Time Factors']",2005/03/10 09:00,2005/06/09 09:00,['2005/03/10 09:00'],"['2004/06/21 00:00 [received]', '2004/10/13 00:00 [revised]', '2004/10/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/03/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/09 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0145-2126(04)00373-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2004.10.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2005 May;29(5):481-91. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2004.10.002.

Whereas normal samples were negative or showed very weak expression that was restricted to CD34(+) cells, Dpl was detected in both cell lines and in most AML and MDS cases by immunocytochemistry and Western blotting. Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction revealed variable mRNA levels in almost all AML and MDS cases, but barely detectable levels in normal bone marrow. These differences were confirmed by in situ hybridization. PRND expression was higher in advanced compared with early MDS (P = 0.01), but Dpl levels did not predict disease progression. In AML there was no correlation between Dpl levels and clinical or laboratory findings. In conclusion, this is the first time that the expression of PRND has been demonstrated in human bone marrow. The molecular mechanism of the observed overexpression is unknown; however, the differential Dpl distribution in AML and MDS versus healthy subjects makes it a possible leukaemia-associated antigen that could be useful for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.","['Travaglino, Erica', 'Comincini, Sergio', 'Benatti, Chiara', 'Azzalin, Alberto', 'Nano, Rosanna', 'Rosti, Vittorio', 'Ferretti, Luca', 'Invernizzi, Rosangela']","['Travaglino E', 'Comincini S', 'Benatti C', 'Azzalin A', 'Nano R', 'Rosti V', 'Ferretti L', 'Invernizzi R']","['Internal Medicine and Medical Oncology, University of Pavia, IRCCS Poloclinico S.

Our previous studies in multiple myeloma and non-APL acute myeloid leukaemia demonstrated that lineage-specific growth factors are required for the maximal activity of many pharmacologic differentiating agents in vitro. Thus, we studied whether the differentiation of APL is similarly dependent on growth factors. We found that the myeloid growth factors granulocyte colony-stimulating factor or granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor markedly increased the differentiation of NB4 cells or APL blasts from clinical samples treated with ATRA, arsenic trioxide (ATO), or bryostatin-1 as evidenced by the enhanced expression of myeloid surface antigens and the inhibition of clonogenic growth. Furthermore, myeloid growth factors were necessary for the differentiation of APL cells since the activity of each pharmacologic agent could be blocked by specific growth factor-neutralizing antibodies. Each differentiating agent was active only at concentrations that inhibited cell cycling, suggesting that this property is also required for differentiation. These data demonstrate that both pharmacologic differentiating agents and myeloid growth factors are required, but neither sufficient, for the differentiation of APL cells. The combined use of pharmacologic differentiating agents and growth factors may improve the clinical efficacy of differentiation therapy in APL.","['Matsui, William', 'Smith, B Douglas', 'Vala, Milada', 'Beal, Nikeshia', 'Huff, Carol Ann', 'Diehl, Louis F', 'Jones, Richard J']","['Matsui W', 'Smith BD', 'Vala M', 'Beal N', 'Huff CA', 'Diehl LF', 'Jones RJ']","['Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21231, USA. matsuwi@jhmi.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Bryostatins)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Macrolides)', '0 (Oxides)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '37O2X55Y9E (bryostatin 1)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/pharmacology', 'Bryostatins', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacology', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*pathology', 'Macrolides/pharmacology', 'Myelopoiesis/*drug effects', 'Oxides/pharmacology', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology']",2005/03/10 09:00,2005/04/20 09:00,['2005/03/10 09:00'],"['2005/03/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/20 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['BJH5395 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2005.05395.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2005 Mar;128(6):853-62. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2005.05395.x.,,,,"['5P30CA06973/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01CA15396/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is the first report to investigate the methylation status of p15 and p16, cell cycle regulatory genes, in children with MDS (n = 9) and juvenile myelomonocytic leukaemia (JMML; n = 18) by using a methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction. The frequency of p15 hypermethylation in paediatric MDS was 78% (7/9), which was comparable to that in adult MDS. In contrast, p15 hypermethylation in JMML was a rare event (17%; 3/18). In JMML, clinical and laboratory characteristics including PTPN11 mutations and aberrant colony formation were not different between the three patients with hypermethylated p15 and the others. Aberrant methylation of p16 was not detected in children with either MDS or JMML. Since p15 and p16 genes were unmethylated in two children with JMML, in whom the disease had progressed with an increased number of blasts, a condition referred to as blastic crisis, we infer that the aberrant methylation of these genes is not responsible for the progression of JMML.

The predictive accuracy of an ex vivo assay should be assessed by correlation of assay results with both response rate and survival. We prospectively investigated the prognostic relevance of pre-therapeutic ex vivo chemosensitivity testing in primary cell cultures from adult AML patients by applying a new evaluation methodology, designated the chemosensitivity index, C(i). This C(i) was designed as a prognostic index by taking the area under the curve as an exact measure of the total dose-response relationship. We found an overall predictive accuracy of 98.2% concerning treatment response, which compares favourably with previously published data ranging from 75% to 92%. Moreover, the C(i) proved to be the strongest prognostic factor for overall survival in a multivariate Cox regression analysis including karyotype grouping and age (P < 0.001), and enabled the evaluation of response to combination therapies and selection of possible treatment alternatives.

To be used clinically, MRD assays must be reliable and accurate. Two well-established techniques, flow cytometry (FC) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR), can detect leukaemic cells with a sensitivity of 0.01% (10(-4)). We analysed diagnostic samples of 45 ALL-patients (37 B-lineage ALL, eight T-lineage ALL) by four-colour FC and real-time PCR. Leukaemia-associated immunophenotypes, at a sensitivity of MRD detection by FC at the 0.01% level, were identified in 41 cases (91%); antigen-receptor gene rearrangements suitable for MRD detection with a sensitivity of 0.01% or better by PCR were identified in 38 cases (84%). The combined use of FC and PCR allowed MRD monitoring in all 45 patients. In 105 follow-up samples, MRD estimates by both methods were highly concordant, with a deviation factor of <5 by Bland-Altman analysis. Importantly, the concordance between FC and PCR was also observed in regenerating bone marrow samples containing high proportions of CD19(+) cells, and in samples studied 24 h after collection. We conclude that both MRD assays yield generally concordant results. Their combined use should enable MRD monitoring in virtually all patients and prevent false-negative results due to clonal evolution or phenotypic shifts.","['Kerst, Gunter', 'Kreyenberg, Hermann', 'Roth, Carmen', 'Well, Catrin', 'Dietz, Klaus', 'Coustan-Smith, Elaine', 'Campana, Dario', 'Koscielniak, Ewa', 'Niemeyer, Charlotte', 'Schlegel, Paul G', 'Muller, Ingo', 'Niethammer, Dietrich', 'Bader, Peter']","['Kerst G', 'Kreyenberg H', 'Roth C', 'Well C', 'Dietz K', 'Coustan-Smith E', 'Campana D', 'Koscielniak E', 'Niemeyer C', 'Schlegel PG', 'Muller I', 'Niethammer D', 'Bader P']","[""Department of Pediatric Haematology and Oncology, University Children's Hospital, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany. gunter.kerst@med.uni-tuebingen.de""]",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods/standards', 'Gene Rearrangement, T-Lymphocyte', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Phenotype', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods/standards', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*pathology', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",2005/03/10 09:00,2005/04/20 09:00,['2005/03/10 09:00'],"['2005/03/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/20 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['BJH5401 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2005.05401.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2005 Mar;128(6):774-82. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2005.05401.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Immunohistochemical detection of procaspase-8, caspase-3a, survivin, p53, CD95, c-Flip and Phospho-RelA (Ser536) was investigated on paraffin-embedded tissues. The expression of c-Flip was found highly related to a poor prognosis, mostly characterized by adults with a chemoresistant disease, resulting in a high death rate within the first year of diagnosis. The 2-year overall survival with c-Flip expression was 24% compared with 93% in the absence of this marker (P = 0.04).

METHODS: The study cohort consisted of 141 white Hispanic pediatric patients who were diagnosed with ALL and were treated at 2 South Texas pediatric oncology centers between 1993 and 2002. Changes in age-standardized and gender-standardized BMI scores were assessed. RESULTS: The study cohort exhibited a steady increase in age-adjusted and gender-adjusted BMI scores for the first 12 months of therapy, a modest increase in BMI scores during the 18-23 month and 24-29 month periods, followed by a slight decrease in BMI scores at 30 months (end of therapy). A repeated-measures analysis indicated significant effects for time (P = 0.019) and time by baseline BMI category interaction (P = 0.0001) but no significant interaction effect between time and gender (P = 0.65). CONCLUSIONS: Although it is known that leukemia therapy is associated with prevalent obesity in survivorship, its pattern of development during therapy has not been elucidated. In the current cohort of Hispanic children with ALL, BMI scores were elevated at diagnosis (mean +/- standard deviation standardized BMI Z score, 0.33 +/- 1.4), then increased, and remained elevated for the entire duration of chemotherapy. Patients who were classified as normal weight exhibited an increase in BMI over time; patients who were classified as overweight at diagnosis exhibited BMI patterns that were relatively stable; and patients who were classified as obese exhibited a very slight decline over time. These findings suggest that the risk for chemotherapy-related weight gain applies predominantly to children who begin ALL therapy within a normal weight range.","['Baillargeon, Jacques', 'Langevin, Anne-Marie', 'Lewis, Margaret', 'Grady, James J', 'Thomas, Paul J', 'Mullins, Judith', 'Estrada, Jaime', 'Pitney, Aaron', 'Sacks, Nancy', 'Pollock, Brad H']","['Baillargeon J', 'Langevin AM', 'Lewis M', 'Grady JJ', 'Thomas PJ', 'Mullins J', 'Estrada J', 'Pitney A', 'Sacks N', 'Pollock BH']","['Center for Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio, Texas 78229-3900, USA. baillargeon@uthscsa.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Body Height', '*Body Mass Index', 'Body Weight/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Child', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cranial Irradiation', 'Female', 'Hispanic or Latino', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Obesity/*etiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/ethnology/*therapy', 'Risk Factors', 'Survivors']",2005/03/09 09:00,2005/05/27 09:00,['2005/03/09 09:00'],"['2005/03/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/05/27 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/09 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.20948 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2005 Apr 15;103(8):1725-9. doi: 10.1002/cncr.20948.,,,,['CA11078/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,['(c) 2005 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,,,

We present the molecular analysis of c4H9, resulting in the identification of a novel gene, SLAG. At the N-terminus, SLAG contains a Sec7 domain also found in proteins of the cytohesin family. In contrast to the cytohesins, no pleckstrin homology domain is present in SLAG. database searches identified several homologues, suggesting that SLAG defines a new subfamily of Sec7 proteins, characterised by an N-terminal Sec7 domain and a new C-terminal pleckstrin homology-like domain. The FISH data led to the hypothesis that rearrangement of SLAG might be involved in the pathogenesis of AML through the generation of a new fusion gene with MYH11.

Although this enzyme deficiency was reportedly caused by partial or total deletion of the MTAP gene, human MTAP-deficient lymphoma cell line DHL-9 has the intact MTAP gene. In order to determine the mechanism of MTAP deficiency in DHL-9, we carried out methylation-specific PCR analysis of sodium bisulfite-treated genomic DNA followed by DNA sequence analysis. Following incubation with various concentrations of 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine, DHL-9 cells were subjected to RT-PCR and an immunoblot analysis for MTAP expression. MTAP promoter in DHL-9 cells was methylated at cytosine of all CpG dinucleotides analyzed. Moreover, 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine treatment induced DHL-9 cells to express MTAP mRNA and protein. Taken together, MTAP deficiency in DHL-9 was caused by transcriptional silencing due to promoter methylation. Promoter methylation of the MTAP gene was also found in DNA samples from adult T-cell leukemia patients. These results indicated that promoter hypermethylation is another mechanism of MTAP deficiency in human malignancy. Thus, immunological diagnostics will be needed for an accurate evaluation of MTAP expression at the protein level.","['Ishii, Masaaki', 'Nakazawa, Keiko', 'Wada, Hideo', 'Nishioka, Junji', 'Nakatani, Kaname', 'Yamada, Yasuaki', 'Kamihira, Shimeru', 'Kusunoki, Masato', 'Nobori, Tsutomu']","['Ishii M', 'Nakazawa K', 'Wada H', 'Nishioka J', 'Nakatani K', 'Yamada Y', 'Kamihira S', 'Kusunoki M', 'Nobori T']","['The Second Department of Surgery, Mie University School of Medicine, 2-174 Edobashi, Tsu, Mie 514-8507, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'EC 2.4.2.1 (Purine-Nucleoside Phosphorylase)', ""EC 2.4.2.28 (5'-methylthioadenosine phosphorylase)"", 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Azacitidine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Base Sequence', '*DNA Methylation', 'Decitabine', '*Gene Silencing', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma/*genetics/*pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Purine-Nucleoside Phosphorylase/*deficiency/*genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2005/03/09 09:00,2005/07/29 09:00,['2005/03/09 09:00'],"['2005/03/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/29 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/09 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2005 Apr;26(4):985-91.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Due to its relevance to cancer therapy, most studies have focused on the cellular consequences of p53 activation in relation to cytotoxic drugs. 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-aza-CdR) is widely used as an anti-cancer drug for the treatment of leukemia and solid tumors. However, the mechanism by which 5-aza-CdR exerts its anti-neoplastic activity remains unclear. Here, we address the role of p53 in regulating cellular responses to 5-aza-CdR treatment in human prostate cancer cells. We found that 5-aza-CdR induces p53 and p21Waf1/Cip1 expression associated with inhibition of cell proliferation in LNCaP cells (p53 wild-type), but not in DU145 cells (p53 mutant). By using pifithrin-alpha, a chemical inhibitor of p53, we confirmed that the increase in p21Waf1/Cip1 expression and inhibition of cell proliferation in LNCaP cells by 5-aza-CdR is p53-dependent. Also, the activation of p53 and p21Waf1/Cip1 pathway by 5-aza-CdR modified multiple gene expressions including apoptotic target genes and MAP kinases in LNCaP cells. 5-aza-CdR-induced apoptosis in LNCaP cells is assessed by DNA fragmentation analysis. Furthermore, knockdown of p53 by pU6-p53 siRNA vector suggests the involvement of MAP kinases in the process of 5-aza-CdR-mediated activation of p53 pathway to inhibit cell proliferation and induce apoptosis. Finally, the comet or SCGE assay and methylation-sensitive restriction analysis demonstrated that 5-aza-CdR induced p53 and p21Waf1/Cip1 expression as a consequence of DNA damage and independent of DNA demethylation. Our findings suggest that 5-aza-CdR induces anti-neoplastic activity primarily through the activation of p53 pathway in response to DNA damage and subsequently leads to inhibition of cell proliferation as well as induction of apoptosis. Therefore, our data indicate that p53 status in tumor cells may be critical for the clinical efficacy and toxicity of 5-aza-CdR.","['Pulukuri, Sai Murali Krishna', 'Rao, Jasti S']","['Pulukuri SM', 'Rao JS']","['Program of Cancer Biology and Department of Biomedical & Therapeutic Sciences, University of Illinois College of Medicine-Peoria, Peoria, IL 61605, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/genetics', 'Azacitidine/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics/pharmacology', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'DNA Damage', 'Decitabine', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Genes, p53', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*biosynthesis/genetics/pharmacology']",2005/03/09 09:00,2005/07/29 09:00,['2005/03/09 09:00'],"['2005/03/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/29 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/09 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2005 Apr;26(4):863-71.,,,,"['CA 75557/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 76350/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 85216/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'NS 47699/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Various end points were used to screen for apoptosis: Morphological changes in cells, the relative numbers of viable and apoptotic cells; translocation of membrane bound phosphatidylserine and DNA analysis. 3 We found that mahanine-induced apoptosis in U937 cells involved activation of caspases, including caspase-3, release of cytochrome c into cytosol, loss of mitochondrial membrane permeability, and decreased levels of cellular ATP. 4 Pretreatment of cells with cyclosporine A, prior to/concomitant with exposure to mahanine, effectively prevented the deleterious effects of the alkaloid on cellular integrity and viability. 5 As mitochondrial permeability is known to be important in the regulation of cytochrome c release, our observations indicate that mitochondria are the principal target of mahanine. More specifically, we propose that mahanine causes the mitochondrial membranes to lose their permeability, resulting in caspase-3 activation and apoptosis.","['Roy, Molay Kumar', 'Thalang, Vipaporn Na', 'Trakoontivakorn, Gassinee', 'Nakahara, Kazuhiko']","['Roy MK', 'Thalang VN', 'Trakoontivakorn G', 'Nakahara K']","['Japan International Research Center for Agricultural Sciences, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-8686, Japan. mkroy@affrc.go.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Br J Pharmacol,British journal of pharmacology,7502536,"['0 (Alkaloids)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Carbazoles)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Ion Channels)', '0 (Mitochondrial Membrane Transport Proteins)', '0 (Mitochondrial Permeability Transition Pore)', '0 (Nucleosomes)', '0 (mahanine)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Alkaloids/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Carbazoles/*pharmacology', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cyclosporine/pharmacology', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/pharmacology', 'Ion Channels/metabolism', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects/physiology', 'Mitochondrial Membrane Transport Proteins', 'Mitochondrial Permeability Transition Pore', 'Nucleosomes/drug effects/genetics', 'Protein Transport', '*Rutaceae', 'U937 Cells']",2005/03/09 09:00,2005/08/24 09:00,['2005/03/09 09:00'],"['2005/03/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/24 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/09 09:00 [entrez]']","['0706137 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.bjp.0706137 [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Pharmacol. 2005 May;145(2):145-55. doi: 10.1038/sj.bjp.0706137.,,,,,PMC1576126,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous reports have identified both Bcl-2 and Bcl-x(L) proteins as survival factors in lung cancer cells since reductions in these proteins can induce apoptosis and sensitize lung cancer cells to apoptosis induced by chemotherapy agents. Myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1), another member of the Bcl-2 family, has been found to be a critical survival factor in hematopoietic cells, yet little data exists for a role of Mcl-1 in human lung cancers. We used NSCLC cell lines to explore how Mcl-1 levels affect lung cancer cell survival and studied tumors from patients to determine expression patterns of Mcl-1. NSCLC cells express abundant Mcl-1 protein and depletion of Mcl-1 levels by antisense Mcl-1 oligonucleotides induces apoptosis in A549 and H1299 lung cancer cells. Reduction in Mcl-1 levels can sensitize lung cancer cells to apoptosis induced by cytotoxic agents as well as by ionizing radiation. Lung cancer cells overexpressing Mcl-1 are less sensitive to apoptosis induced by chemotherapeutic agents, ZD1839 (an inhibitor of EGFR tyrosine kinase) and Bcl-2 or Bcl-x(L) antisense oligonucleotides. We find that epidermal growth factor (EGF) can enhance Mcl-1 protein levels in an ERK-dependent manner. Signal transduction agents that reduce Mcl-1 levels correlated with their individual ability to induce apoptosis in lung cancer cells. Finally, NSCLC tumors taken directly from patients have elevated levels of Mcl-1 protein compared with normal adjacent lung tissue. Therefore, agents that target Mcl-1 can induce apoptosis and sensitize cells to apoptosis induced by cytotoxic agents. Mcl-1 protein is overexpressed in a subset of human NSCLC and enhanced levels of Mcl-1 may protect lung cancer cells from death induced by a variety of pro-apoptotic stimuli.","['Song, Lanxi', 'Coppola, Domenico', 'Livingston, Sandy', 'Cress, Doug', 'Haura, Eric B']","['Song L', 'Coppola D', 'Livingston S', 'Cress D', 'Haura EB']","['Thoracic Oncology/Experimental Therapeutics, University of South Florida College of Medicine, Tampa, Florida, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20050320,United States,Cancer Biol Ther,Cancer biology & therapy,101137842,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Quinazolines)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ErbB Receptors)', 'S65743JHBS (Gefitinib)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'ErbB Receptors/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Gefitinib', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/genetics/*metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism/*physiology', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism/*physiology', 'Quinazolines/pharmacology', 'Radiation Tolerance', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'bcl-X Protein/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics']",2005/03/09 09:00,2006/03/22 09:00,['2005/03/09 09:00'],"['2005/03/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/22 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/09 09:00 [entrez]']","['1496 [pii]', '10.4161/cbt.4.3.1496 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Biol Ther. 2005 Mar;4(3):267-76. doi: 10.4161/cbt.4.3.1496.

We report the incidence and outcome of solid tumors at 10-year follow-up in a large cohort of uniformly treated patients who underwent ABMT for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 1982 and 1997, 605 patients underwent ABMT for B-cell NHL, with uniform conditioning with cyclophosphamide and total-body irradiation followed by reinfusion of autologous bone marrow purged with anti-B-cell monoclonal antibodies. Current information on relapse of disease and second malignancies was obtained via an institutional review board-approved questionnaire sent to the referring oncologists. RESULTS: Forty-two solid tumors, six non-MDS hematologic malignancies, 39 nonmelanoma skin cancers, and 68 cases of MDS/acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) were observed at a median follow-up of 9.5 years. A cumulative incidence model using death as a competing risk found that the 10-year incidence of second malignancy is 21%, with 10.0% non-MDS malignancies. The projected incidence of all malignancies at 15 years is 29%. The principal risk factor for second malignancy is increased age at ABMT (P = .0002). In the entire cohort, 9.6% of patients have died of second malignancy. CONCLUSION: Lengthy follow-up demonstrates a significant incidence of second malignancies after ABMT for NHL. Although the incidence of MDS/AML starts to plateau, the incidence of solid tumors continues to rise. Second malignancies are responsible for a significant fraction of overall mortality following ABMT.","['Brown, Jennifer R', 'Yeckes, Heather', 'Friedberg, Jonathan W', 'Neuberg, Donna', 'Kim, Helen', 'Nadler, Lee M', 'Freedman, Arnold S']","['Brown JR', 'Yeckes H', 'Friedberg JW', 'Neuberg D', 'Kim H', 'Nadler LM', 'Freedman AS']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, 44 Binney St, Boston, MA 02115, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20050307,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/*adverse effects/*therapeutic use', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cyclophosphamide/*adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*drug therapy/*radiotherapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology/*etiology', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*epidemiology/*etiology', 'Risk Factors', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Whole-Body Irradiation/*adverse effects']",2005/03/09 09:00,2005/04/22 09:00,['2005/03/09 09:00'],"['2005/03/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/22 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/09 09:00 [entrez]']","['JCO.2005.05.158 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2005.05.158 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2005 Apr 1;23(10):2208-14. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2005.05.158.

As our original method of graft processing was unsuitable for large-scale clinical studies, we use automated devices for CD34+ cell purification. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixty-seven patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML; 19 complete remission [CR] 1, 14 CR 2, nine CR > 2, 25 in relapse) and 37 with acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL; 14 CR 1, eight CR 2, two CR > 2, 13 in relapse) were conditioned with total-body irradiation, thiotepa, fludarabine, and antithymocyte globulin. Peripheral-blood progenitor cells were mobilized with recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor and depleted of T-cells using CD34+ cell immunoselection. No post-transplantation graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) prophylaxis was administered. RESULTS: Primary engraftment was achieved in 94 of 101 assessable patients. Six of the seven patients who rejected the primary graft, engrafted after a second transplantation. Overall, 100 of 101 patients engrafted. Acute GvHD developed in eight of 100 patients, and chronic GvHD, in five of 70 assessable patients. Thirty-eight patients died of nonleukemic causes. Relapse occurred in nine of 66 patients receiving transplantation in remission and in 17 of 38 receiving transplantation in relapse. Median follow-up of the 40 patients who survived event-free was 22 months (range, 1 to 65 months).

Many chemotherapeutic drugs induce mitochondrial membrane permeability transition, membrane depolarization, osmotic swelling, and release of cytochrome c, involving the opening of the permeability transition pore complex (PTPC). Because jasmonates exert their cytotoxic effects independent of transcription, translation, and p53 expression, we hypothesized that these compounds may act directly on mitochondria. Mitochondrial membrane depolarization was determined by flow cytometry, and cytochrome c release by Western blotting. Mitochondria were isolated by mechanical lysis and differential centrifugation. Cytotoxicity was measured by a tetrazolium-based assay, and mitochondrial swelling by spectrophotometry. Jasmonates induced membrane depolarization and cytochrome c release in intact human cancer cell lines. Jasmonates induced swelling in mitochondria isolated from Hep 3B hepatoma cells, but not in mitochondria isolated from 3T3 nontransformed cells or from normal lymphocytes, in a PTPC-mediated manner. Methyl jasmonate induced the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria isolated from cancer cell lines in a PTPC-mediated manner, but not from mitochondria isolated from normal lymphocytes. A correlation was found between cytotoxicity of methyl jasmonate and the percentage of leukemic cells in the blood of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Jasmonates induced membrane depolarization in CLL cells, and swelling and release of cytochrome c in mitochondria isolated from these cells. In conclusion, jasmonates act directly on mitochondria derived from cancer cells in a PTPC-mediated manner, and could therefore bypass premitochondrial apoptotic blocks. Jasmonates are promising candidates for the treatment of CLL and other types of cancer.","['Rotem, Ronit', 'Heyfets, Alina', 'Fingrut, Orit', 'Blickstein, Dorit', 'Shaklai, Mati', 'Flescher, Eliezer']","['Rotem R', 'Heyfets A', 'Fingrut O', 'Blickstein D', 'Shaklai M', 'Flescher E']","['Department of Human Microbiology, Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Acetates)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cyclopentanes)', '0 (Ion Channels)', '0 (Mitochondrial Membrane Transport Proteins)', '0 (Mitochondrial Permeability Transition Pore)', '0 (Oxylipins)', '0 (Plant Growth Regulators)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', '900N171A0F (methyl jasmonate)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Acetates/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Membrane Permeability/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cyclopentanes/*pharmacology', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'Fibroblasts/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Ion Channels/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Liver Neoplasms/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphocytes/drug effects', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects', 'Mice', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects', 'Mitochondrial Membrane Transport Proteins', 'Mitochondrial Permeability Transition Pore', 'Mitochondrial Swelling', 'Oxylipins', 'Plant Growth Regulators/*pharmacology']",2005/03/09 09:00,2005/04/20 09:00,['2005/03/09 09:00'],"['2005/03/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/20 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/09 09:00 [entrez]']","['65/5/1984 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-04-3091 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2005 Mar 1;65(5):1984-93. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-04-3091.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus, IMP-3 is considered to be an oncofetal protein. The functional significance of IMP-3 is not clear. To identify the functions of IMP-3 in target gene expression and cell proliferation, RNA interference was employed to knock down IMP-3 expression. Using human K562 leukemia cells as a model, we show that IMP-3 protein associates with IGF-II leader-3 and leader-4 mRNAs and H19 RNA but not c-myc and beta-actin mRNAs in vivo by messenger ribonucleoprotein immunoprecipitation analyses. IMP-3 knock down significantly decreased levels of intracellular and secreted IGF-II without affecting IGF-II leader-3, leader-4, c-myc, or beta-actin mRNA levels and H19 RNA levels compared with the negative control siRNA treatment. Moreover, IMP-3 knock down specifically suppressed translation of chimeric IGF-II leader-3/luciferase mRNA without altering reporter mRNA levels. Together, these results suggest that IMP-3 knock down reduced IGF-II expression by inhibiting translation of IGF-II mRNA. IMP-3 knock down also markedly inhibited cell proliferation. The addition of recombinant human IGF-II peptide to these cells restored cell proliferation rates to normal. IMP-3 and IMP-1, two members of the IMP family with significant structural similarity, appear to have some distinct RNA targets and functions in K562 cells. Thus, we have identified IMP-3 as a translational activator of IGF-II leader-3 mRNA. IMP-3 plays a critical role in regulation of cell proliferation via an IGF-II-dependent pathway in K562 leukemia cells.","['Liao, Baisong', 'Hu, Yan', 'Herrick, David J', 'Brewer, Gary']","['Liao B', 'Hu Y', 'Herrick DJ', 'Brewer G']","['Department of Molecular Genetics, Microbiology, and Immunology, Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, Piscataway, New Jersey 08854, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",20050307,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"[""0 (5' Untranslated Regions)"", '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '67763-97-7 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor II)']",IM,"[""5' Untranslated Regions/genetics/*metabolism"", '*Cell Proliferation', 'Humans', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor II/genetics/*metabolism', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/*genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*physiology', 'Trans-Activators/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*physiology']",2005/03/09 09:00,2005/09/03 09:00,['2005/03/09 09:00'],"['2005/03/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/03 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/09 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(20)65806-9 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M500270200 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2005 May 6;280(18):18517-24. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M500270200.

The inactivation of the proapoptotic protein Bad, upon phosphorylation by different kinases of these two pathways, may play an important role in different human malignancies. Therefore, we have expressed and purified a new chimeric protein, hGM-CSF-Bad, linking the human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor to the N-terminus of the proapoptotic protein human Bad, to deliver Bad into tumor cells and induce apoptosis. Indeed, the human GM-CSF receptor is a good target because it is overexpressed on many leukemias and solid tumors and is not detectable on stem cells. We found that the chimeric protein binds the human GM-CSF receptor, is endocytosed, and appears to reach the cytosol via retrograde ER transport. After entering cells, the protein is able to induce apoptosis of human leukemia cells and human colon and gastric carcinoma cell lines (IC(50) values as low as 1 muM). We conclude that GM-CSF-Bad can overcome the inappropriate survival stimuli in transformed cells and restore the apoptotic pathway.

Because of their harmful nature, lesions are recognized by many proteins involved in DNA repair. However, mounting evidence suggests that lesions also are recognized by proteins with no obvious role in repair processes. One such protein is topoisomerase II, an essential enzyme that removes knots and tangles from the DNA. Because topoisomerase II generates a protein-linked double-stranded DNA break during its catalytic cycle, it has the potential to fragment the genome. Previous studies indicate that abasic sites and other lesions that distort the double helix stimulate topoisomerase II-mediated DNA cleavage. Therefore, to further explore interactions between DNA lesions and the enzyme, the effects of exocyclic adducts on DNA cleavage mediated by human topoisomerase IIalpha were determined. When located within the four-base overhang of a topoisomerase II cleavage site (at the +2 or +3 position 3' relative to the scissile bond), 3,N(4)-ethenodeoxycytidine, 3,N(4)-etheno-2'-ribocytidine, 1,N(2)-ethenodeoxyguanosine, pyrimido[1,2-a]purin-10(3H)-one deoxyribose (M(1)dG), and 1,N(2)-propanodeoxyguanosine increased DNA scission approximately 5-17-fold. Enhanced cleavage did not result from an increased affinity of topoisomerase IIalpha for adducted DNA or a decreased rate of religation. Therefore, it is concluded that these exocyclic lesions act by accelerating the forward rate of enzyme-mediated DNA scission. Finally, treatment of cultured human cells with 2-chloroacetaldehyde, a reactive metabolite of vinyl chloride that generates etheno adducts, increased cellular levels of DNA cleavage by topoisomerase IIalpha. This finding suggests that type II topoisomerases interact with exocyclic DNA lesions in physiological systems.","['Velez-Cruz, Renier', 'Riggins, James N', 'Daniels, J Scott', 'Cai, Hongliang', 'Guengerich, F Peter', 'Marnett, Lawrence J', 'Osheroff, Neil']","['Velez-Cruz R', 'Riggins JN', 'Daniels JS', 'Cai H', 'Guengerich FP', 'Marnett LJ', 'Osheroff N']","['Department of Biochemistry, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, Tennessee 37232-0146, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,"['0 (Alkylating Agents)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA Adducts)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '108929-11-9 (1,N(2)-ethenodeoxyguanosine)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', '85352-97-2 (cyclic 1,N(2)-propanodeoxyguanosine)', 'CF069F5D9C (chloroacetaldehyde)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)', 'G9481N71RO (Deoxyguanosine)', 'GO1N1ZPR3B (Acetaldehyde)']",IM,"['Acetaldehyde/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism/toxicity', 'Alkylating Agents/metabolism/toxicity', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/genetics/physiology', 'DNA Adducts/metabolism/*toxicity', '*DNA Damage/drug effects/genetics/physiology', 'DNA Repair/genetics/physiology', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/*chemistry/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Deoxyguanosine/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism/toxicity', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', 'Proto-Oncogenes/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/chemistry/genetics']",2005/03/09 09:00,2005/06/09 09:00,['2005/03/09 09:00'],"['2005/03/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/09 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/09 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/bi0478289 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochemistry. 2005 Mar 15;44(10):3972-81. doi: 10.1021/bi0478289.,,,,"['ES00267/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'ES10375/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA009582/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA09385/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'ES05919/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'CA87819/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM53960/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'CA44353/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'ES07028/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Genome packaging is mediated by interactions between the nucleocapsid (NC) domains of assembling Gag polyproteins and an RNA packaging signal, located near the 5' end of the genome, called Psi. We recently discovered that the NC protein of the Moloney murine leukemia virus (MLV) can bind with high affinity to conserved UCUG elements within the MLV packaging signal [D'Souza, V., and Summers, M. F. (2004) Nature 431, 586-590]. Selective binding to dimeric RNA is regulated by a conformational RNA switch, in which the UCUG elements are sequestered by base pairing in the monomeric RNA and do not bind NC, but become exposed for NC binding upon dimerization. Dimerization-dependent structural changes occur in other regions of the Psi-site, exposing guanosine-containing segments that might also bind NC. Here we demonstrate that short RNAs containing three such sequences, ACAG, UUUG, and UCCG, can bind NC with significant affinity (K(d) = 94-315 nM). Titration experiments with oligoribonucleotides of varying lengths and compositions, combined with NMR-based structural studies, reveal that binding is strictly dependent on the presence of an unpaired guanosine, and that relative binding affinities can vary by more than 1 order of magnitude depending on the nature of the three upstream nucleotides. Binding is enhanced in short RNAs containing terminal phosphates, indicating that electrostatic interactions contribute significantly to binding. Our findings extend a previously published model for genome recognition, in which the NC domains of assembling Gag molecules interact with multiple X(i-3)-X(i-2)-X(i-1)-G(i) elements (X is a variable nucleotide) that appear to be preferentially exposed in the dimeric RNA.","['Dey, Anwesha', 'York, Danielle', 'Smalls-Mantey, Adjoa', 'Summers, Michael F']","['Dey A', 'York D', 'Smalls-Mantey A', 'Summers MF']","['Howard Hughes Medical Institute and Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Maryland Baltimore County, 1000 Hilltop Circle, Baltimore, Maryland 21250, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,"['0 (Nucleocapsid Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '12133JR80S (Guanosine)', '1445-07-4 (Pseudouridine)']",IM,"['Base Composition', 'Base Pairing/genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'Crystallography, X-Ray', 'Genome, Viral', 'Guanosine/metabolism', 'Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics/*metabolism', 'Nucleocapsid Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding/genetics', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary/genetics', 'Pseudouridine/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Viral/*metabolism', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Virus Assembly/*genetics', 'Zinc Fingers/genetics']",2005/03/09 09:00,2005/06/09 09:00,['2005/03/09 09:00'],"['2005/03/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/09 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/09 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/bi047639q [doi]'],ppublish,Biochemistry. 2005 Mar 15;44(10):3735-44. doi: 10.1021/bi047639q.,,,,"['GM08663/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'GM42561/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,"['PDB/1WWD', 'PDB/1WWE', 'PDB/1WWF', 'PDB/1WWG']",,,,,,,,,

The patient was sent to the nearest hospital where he was treated with diuretics and observed for 24 hours. There were no complications. The pathogenesis of TRALI has been attributed to an interaction between anti-granulocyte antibodies and granulocytes. In addition, bioactive compounds produced during the storage of blood products have been implicated. It is important to recognize TRALI as the cause of dyspnoea when cardiac or pulmonary causes are excluded. The overall prognosis is good when treatment is started in time. The management of TRALI is supportive, with mechanical ventilation when necessary. After excluding donors with proven anti-granulocyte antibodies from further donation, there is no increased risk for recurrent episodes after future transfusion of plasma-containing blood products.","['Kessels, L W', 'Visser, O J']","['Kessels LW', 'Visser OJ']","['VU Medisch Centrum, afd.

DESIGN: Retrospective. METHOD: During the period from May 1985 to November 1999, 120 15-20-year-old adolescents with ALL were treated: 47 according to a DCOG protocol and 73 according to a HOVON protocol. The records of the integrated cancer centres indicate that this represented about two-thirds of all known adolescents with ALL in the Netherlands. RESULTS: Adolescents with ALL treated according to the DCOG protocols had significantly better 5-year survival rates (79% versus 38%), a significantly lower probability of relapse (27% versus 55%) and a lower treatment-related mortality (4% versus 25%) than the adolescents treated according to the HOVON protocols. CONCLUSION: This difference in outcome was most likely related to differences in structure and content between the DCOG and HOVON protocols. The HOVON protocols consisted of relatively short, intensive chemotherapy, often followed by autologous or allogeneic bone-marrow transplantation. Several treatment elements present in the DCOG protocols, such as high-dose methotrexate, reinduction therapy and maintenance therapy were absent in the HOVON protocols. Moreover, the cumulative dosages of dexamethasone, mercaptopurine, asparaginase and vincristine were lower in the HOVON protocols.","['de Bont, J M', 'van der Holt, B', 'Dekker, A W', 'van der Does-van den Berg, A', 'Sonneveld, P', 'Pieters, R']","['de Bont JM', 'van der Holt B', 'Dekker AW', 'van der Does-van den Berg A', 'Sonneveld P', 'Pieters R']","['Locatie Sophia Kinderziekenhuis, afd.

We compared their effects in a bone nodule-forming model of in vitro osteogenesis, rat calvaria (RC) cell cultures. Using a dominant-negative LIF mutant (hLIF-05), we showed that in RC cell cultures mouse OSM (mOSM) activates exclusively glycoprotein 130 (gp130)/OSMR. In treatments starting at early nodule formation stage, LIF, mOSM, IL-11, and IL-6 + sIL-6R inhibit bone nodule formation, that is, osteoprogenitor differentiation. Treatment with mOSM, and no other cytokine of the family, in early cultures (day 1-3 or 1-4) increases bone colony numbers. hLIF-05 also dose dependently stimulates bone nodule formation, confirming the inhibitory action of gp130/LIFR on osteogenesis. In pulse treatments at successive stages of bone nodule formation and maturation, LIF blocks osteocalcin (OCN) expression by differentiated osteoblasts, but has no effect on bone sialoprotein (BSP) expression. Mouse OSM inhibits OCN and BSP expression in preconfluent cultures with no or progressively reduced effects at later stages, reflecting the disruption of early nodules, possibly due to the strong apoptotic action of mOSM in RC cell cultures. In summary, LIFR and OSMR display differential effects on differentiation and phenotypic expression of osteogenic cells, most likely through different signal transduction pathways. In particular, gp130/OSMR is the only receptor complex of the family to stimulate osteoprogenitor differentiation in the RC cell culture model.","['Malaval, Luc', 'Liu, Fina', 'Vernallis, Ann B', 'Aubin, Jane E']","['Malaval L', 'Liu F', 'Vernallis AB', 'Aubin JE']","['INSERM U403, Lyon, France. luc.malaval@univ-st-etienne.fr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (IL6ST protein, human)', '0 (Il6st protein, mouse)', '0 (Il6st protein, rat)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (LIFR protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lifr protein, mouse)', '0 (Lifr protein, rat)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (OSM protein, human)', '0 (Osm protein, mouse)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-6)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', '0 (Receptors, Oncostatin M)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '106956-32-5 (Oncostatin M)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD/*physiology', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/*physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130', 'Growth Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/pharmacology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Oncostatin M', 'Osteoblasts/*cytology/drug effects/physiology', 'Osteogenesis/physiology', 'Peptides/pharmacology', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Receptors, Cytokine/*physiology', 'Receptors, Interleukin-6/physiology', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF', 'Receptors, Oncostatin M', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Skull/*cytology', 'Stem Cells/*cytology']",2005/03/08 09:00,2005/08/27 09:00,['2005/03/08 09:00'],"['2005/03/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/27 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/08 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcp.20312 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 2005 Aug;204(2):585-93. doi: 10.1002/jcp.20312.,,,,,,,,,"['(c) 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,

We investigated the global gene expression profiles of 35 APL patients (19 AML M3, 16 AML M3v) by using high-density DNA-oligonucleotide microarrays. First, an unsupervised approach clearly separated APL samples from other AMLs characterized genetically as t(8;21) (n = 35), inv(16) (n = 35), or t(11q23)/MLL (n = 35) or as having a normal karyotype (n = 50). Second, we found genes with functional relevance for blood coagulation that were differentially expressed between APL and other AMLs. Furthermore, a supervised pairwise comparison between M3 and M3v revealed differential expression of genes that encode for biological functions and pathways such as granulation and maturation of hematologic cells, explaining morphologic and clinical differences. Discrimination between M3 and M3v based on gene signatures showed a median classification accuracy of 90% by use of 10-fold CV and support vector machines. Additional molecular mutations such as FLT3-LM, which were significantly more frequent in M3v than in M3 (P < 0.0001), may partly contribute to the different phenotypes.

Southern blot analysis indicated that a rearrangement of the MLL gene was involved in the chromosomal abnormality. cDNA panhandle polymerase chain reaction (PCR) identified the fusion transcript, in which MLL exon 6 was fused in-frame with EB1 exon 5. The presence of the MLL-EB1 and the reciprocal EB1-MLL fusion transcripts was verified by reverse-transcription PCR. EB1 is the first gene on chromosome 20 found to fuse with MLL. The genomic break junctions of MLL-EB1 and EB1-MLL were amplified by long-distance PCR. Sequencing of the break junctions revealed that multiple DNA breaks had occurred and that the DNA fragments flanked by these breaks had been duplicated, deleted, or inverted. Nontemplate DNA segments of 2 bp also were detected at the breakpoints on derivative chromosomes 11 and 20.

Trastuzumab, which is a monoclonal antibody to HER-2, is an effective treatment in some women with breast carcinomas that overexpress HER-2, as demonstrated by immunohistochemistry. The objective of this Phase II study was to determine whether trastuzumab would effect responses in patients with nonsmall cell lung carcinoma who had tumors that overexpressed HER-2. METHODS: Patients were required to have Stage IIIB or Stage IV nonsmall cell lung carcinoma and tumors with 2+ or 3+ expression of HER-2, as determined with immunohistochemistry, and they may have received up to 1 prior chemotherapy regimen. Trastuzumab at a dose of 4 mg/kg was given intravenously on Week 1; then, weekly doses of 2 mg/kg were given. Response revaluation was performed every 8 weeks. RESULTS: Among 209 screened patients, 24 patients (11%) had tumors with 2+ or 3+ expression of HER-2. One patient achieved a partial response, and one patient experienced a treatment-related death due to pulmonary toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: Single-agent trastuzumab did not exhibit significant clinical activity against nonsmall cell lung carcinoma when HER-2 expression levels were measured by immunohistochemistry.","['Clamon, Gerald', 'Herndon, James', 'Kern, Jeffrey', 'Govindan, Ramaswamy', 'Garst, Jennifer', 'Watson, Dorothy', 'Green, Mark']","['Clamon G', 'Herndon J', 'Kern J', 'Govindan R', 'Garst J', 'Watson D', 'Green M']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Iowa, Iowa City, Iowa 52242-1099, USA. gerald-clamon@uiowa.edu']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, ErbB-2)', 'P188ANX8CK (Trastuzumab)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Receptor, ErbB-2/*metabolism', 'Survival Rate', 'Trastuzumab', 'Treatment Outcome']",2005/03/08 09:00,2005/05/27 09:00,['2005/03/08 09:00'],"['2005/03/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/05/27 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/08 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.20950 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2005 Apr 15;103(8):1670-5. doi: 10.1002/cncr.20950.,,,,"['CA03927/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA04326/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA08025/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA11028/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA21060/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA31946/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA336/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA33601/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA45418/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA45808/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA47577/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA47642/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA77440/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,['(c) 2005 American Cancer Society.'],['Cancer and Leukemia Group B'],,,,,,,

If identified early, however, survival is improved suggesting a benefit of early detection. The authors have used proteomics technology in an attempt to identify novel markers that permit early detection of NB and characterize its molecular makeup. METHODS: Three different human NB cell lines SK-N-AS, SK-N-DZ, and SK-N-FI were subjected to series of biochemical fractionation steps to extract nuclear proteins. These proteins were analyzed for differential expression by 2-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Polypeptides of interest were subsequently identified by liquid chromatography-linked tandem mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Multiple proteins were identified in these human NB cell lines including SET (a ubiquitous nuclear protein), stathmin (a cytosolic signal transduction protein), and grp94 (a heat shock protein). SET is a putative oncogene associated with the chromosomal translocation (6;9) leading to acute undifferentiated leukemia. Stathmin is an oncogene found in greater abundance in leukemic cells compared to nonleukemic cells. A total of 94-kDa glucose-regulated protein has been shown to be protective in human breast cancer cells in vitro and related with the occurrence, differentiation, and progression of human lung cancer. The first protein has not been previously associated with NB. CONCLUSIONS: The identification of these 3 previously unrecognized cancer-related potential biomarkers in human NB cell lines may prove useful in developing diagnostic tests. The proteomic methodology of 2-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis/mass spectrometry also provides an improved opportunity to understand the natural history of NB and develop novel chemotherapeutic agents for this prevalent childhood malignancy with a dismal outcome.","['Escobar, Mauricio A', 'Hoelz, Derek J', 'Sandoval, John A', 'Hickey, Robert J', 'Grosfeld, Jay L', 'Malkas, Linda H']","['Escobar MA', 'Hoelz DJ', 'Sandoval JA', 'Hickey RJ', 'Grosfeld JL', 'Malkas LH']","[""Section of Pediatric Surgery, Department of Surgery, Riley Children's Hospital, Indianapolis, IN 46202, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Pediatr Surg,Journal of pediatric surgery,0052631,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Histone Chaperones)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (SET protein, human)', '0 (Stathmin)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (glucose-regulated proteins)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone/analysis', 'DNA Fingerprinting', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins/analysis', 'Histone Chaperones', 'Humans', 'Mass Spectrometry/methods', 'Membrane Proteins/analysis', 'Neuroblastoma/*genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Proteomics/methods', 'Stathmin/analysis', 'Transcription Factors/analysis']",2005/03/08 09:00,2006/03/01 09:00,['2005/03/08 09:00'],"['2005/03/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/01 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0022346804007080 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jpedsurg.2004.10.032 [doi]']",ppublish,J Pediatr Surg. 2005 Feb;40(2):349-58. doi: 10.1016/j.jpedsurg.2004.10.032.,,,,"['CA57350/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA83199/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

In particular, the cell surface sialylation state may govern the liberation of CD34+ hematopoietic precursors from bone marrow stroma cells and extracellular matrix. In order to assess the overall surface sialylation of live human CD34+ hematopoietic precursor cells, we applied a previously described flow cytometric enzyme assay. Cells with and without sialidase pretreatment were incubated in the presence of fluorescent CMP-sialic acid and exogenous ST6GalI. Thus sialylation of surface-expressed lactosamine residues was analysed. We demonstrated that surface lactosamines of CD34+ precursors derived from bone marrow and peripheral blood are over 95% sialylated, predominantly in alpha2-6 linkage. These results are in accordance with flow cytometric analysis of surface lectin staining. Sialic acid specific lectins MAA and SNA were strongly bound whereas SBA, VVA, and PNA became reactive only after sialidase pretreatment. CD34+ leukemia cell lines TF1 and KG1a also showed a high degree of surface sialylation, whereas cell line KG1 expressed to the largest extent free lactosamines. In these cell lines, alpha2-6 and alpha2-3 sialylated residues were present in equal amounts. In a variation of the flow cytometric enzyme assay, live cells were incubated without exogenous STGal I to measure the activity of endogenous ecto-sialyltransferase. Ecto sialyltransferase activity was observed in all CD34+ cells which was able to resialylate major surface glycoproteins such as HLA Class I, CD45, CD43, and CD34.

Previously, we positioned the critical haematopoietic-specific transcription factor PU.1 within a minimally deleted region. We now report a high frequency (>65%) of missense mutation at codon 235 in the DNA-binding Ets domain of PU.1 in murine AML. Earlier studies, outside the context of malignancy, determined that conversion of arginine 235 (R235) to any other amino-acid residue leads to ablation of DNA-binding function and loss of expression of downstream targets. We show that mutation of R235 does not lead to protein loss, and occurs specifically in those AMLs showing loss of one copy of PU.1 (P=0.001, Fisher's exact test). PU.1 mutations were not found in the coding region, UTRs or promoter of human therapy-related AMLs. Potentially regulatory elements upstream of PU.1 were located but no mutations found. In conclusion, we have identified the cause of murine radiation-induced AML and have shown that loss of one copy of PU.1, as a consequence of flanking radiation-sensitive fragile domains on chromosome 2, and subsequent R235 conversion are highly specific to this mouse model.

Downregulation of BLM by antisense cDNA or dominant-negative mutant inhibits homologous recombination repair (HRR) and increases sensitivity to cisplatin in BCR/ABL-positive cells. Bone marrow cells from mice heterozygous for BLM mutation, BLM(Cin/+), transfected with BCR/ABL display increased sensitivity to cisplatin compared to those obtained from the wild-type littermates. BCR/ABL promotes interactions of BLM with RAD51, while simultaneous overexpression of BLM and RAD51 in normal cells increases drug resistance.

The present study accentuates the proposed role of the retrovirally tagged genes in PDGF-driven gliomagenesis and indicates that insertional mutagenesis can promote glioma progression.","['Johansson, Fredrik K', 'Goransson, Hanna', 'Westermark, Bengt']","['Johansson FK', 'Goransson H', 'Westermark B']","['The Rudbeck Laboratory, Department of Genetics and Pathology, University Hospital, SE-751 85 Uppsala, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Platelet-Derived Growth Factor)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-sis)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '1B56C968OA (Becaplermin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Becaplermin', 'Brain Neoplasms/*genetics/*pathology', 'Disease Progression', 'Glioma/genetics/pathology', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', '*Mutagenesis, Insertional', 'Oligodendroglia/pathology', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Platelet-Derived Growth Factor/genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-sis', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Retroviridae/*genetics']",2005/03/08 09:00,2005/06/29 09:00,['2005/03/08 09:00'],"['2005/03/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/29 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['1208553 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.onc.1208553 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2005 Jun 2;24(24):3896-905. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1208553.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After transplant, immune function is poor despite transplantation of mature lymphocytes from immune-competent donors. We tested the hypothesis that early antigen encounter at the time of cell transplant would improve the desired donor T-cell responses. Two independent models of peptide-specific T-cell responses were studied. The model for CD4 cells employed T cells from transgenic (Tg) DO11.11 mice that constitutively express the T-cell receptor for the class II-restricted ovalbumin peptide 323-339. The model for CD8 cells employed non-Tg H2-Db-restricted T-cell responses to the influenza nucleoprotein peptide 366-374. As measured both functionally and by direct imaging of T cells using clonotypic reagents, encounter with specific antigen at the time of T-cell transplantation led to clonal expansion of donor T cells and preservation of donor T-cell function in the post transplant immune environment. Antigen-specific donor T-cell function was poor if antigen encounter was delayed or omitted. Severe parent>F1 graft-versus-host reactions blocked the effect of early antigen exposure. Vaccination of transplant recipients against microbial or leukemia antigens may be worthy of study.","['Mori, S', 'Kocak, U', 'Shaw, J L', 'Mullen, C A']","['Mori S', 'Kocak U', 'Shaw JL', 'Mullen CA']","['Department of Pediatrics, Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, NY 14642, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,"['0 (5-(6)-carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester)', '0 (Antigens)', '0 (Fluoresceins)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Succinimides)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens/chemistry/immunology', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects/*methods', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluoresceins/pharmacology', 'Fluorescent Dyes/pharmacology', 'Graft vs Host Disease/immunology', 'Immunotherapy/methods', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Peptides/chemistry', 'Spleen/cytology', 'Succinimides/pharmacology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Time Factors']",2005/03/08 09:00,2005/07/29 09:00,['2005/03/08 09:00'],"['2005/03/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/29 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['1704883 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.bmt.1704883 [doi]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2005 Apr;35(8):793-801. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1704883.,,,,"['1 R01 CA10628-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5T32CA073954-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Blood-borne infections decreased over time, while those in the urinary and respiratory tracts increased (P = 0.04). Sixty-two percent of infections occurred in neutropenic patients. PHO patients had an overall mortality of 21%, but those with fungal infections experienced a 2.6-fold higher mortality that was not attributable to infections alone. Empiric antifungal therapy had no effect on mortality rates. Concurrent nonfungal infections did not increase mortality rates. The incidence of fungal infections increased over time, possibly as a result of advances in antibacterial and chemotherapeutic regimens. Adolescents and patients with leukemia were especially at risk. Fungal infections are a poor prognostic factor, independent of fungal-related mortality.

In contrast, DC cultivated from peripheral mononuclear cells of patients (n = 9) had comparable morphology and expression of costimulatory molecules to DC obtained from healthy individuals, which was even higher after tumor lysate pulsing. Autologous lymphocyte proliferation increased after DC blasts lysate pulsation and further after lymphocyte restimulation, showing evidence of induction of specific cytotoxic lymphocytes. When comparing both cell sources for the preparation of DC in patients with ALL, it appears that peripheral mononuclear cells obtained after chemotherapy are more suitable than bone marrow leukemic blasts due to similar morphology, phenotypic, and functional capacity to monocytes of healthy donors. Despite this, it is necessary to take into account individual variability when preparing DC-based vaccines.

The latter cases were subclassified as those seven where proliferation was induced (subgroup IIa) and the remaining 19 in whom apoptosis occurred (subgroup IIa). Signal disruption in group I was confirmed by the absence of Ca2+ mobilization. Activation of PI3K was constitutive in subgroup IIa, but not in subgroup IIb, and that of Akt induced by anti-mu in subgroup IIa, but not in subgroup IIb. Among the MAPK, ERK was more highly activated relative to p38 in subgroup IIa, whereas activation of p38 predominated over that of ERK in subgroup IIb. For subgroup IIb cells, based on tyrosine phosphorylation and translocation into lipid rafts, sIgM signaling was shown to be enhanced by Zap70. The different consequences of signaling through sIgM were associated with biological prognosis indicators. These included high levels of CD38, lack of mutations in the IgVH chain genes, preferential usage of full-length CD79b, and severe clinical stage. Thus, modification of sIgM-induced signaling could be a therapeutic approach.","['Nedellec, Steven', 'Renaudineau, Yves', 'Bordron, Anne', 'Berthou, Christian', 'Porakishvili, Nina', 'Lydyard, Peter M', 'Pers, Jacques-Olivier', 'Youinou, Pierre']","['Nedellec S', 'Renaudineau Y', 'Bordron A', 'Berthou C', 'Porakishvili N', 'Lydyard PM', 'Pers JO', 'Youinou P']","['Institut de Synergie des Sciences et de la Sante, Brest University Medical School, Brest, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Cross-Linking Reagents)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP70 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Apoptosis', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Calcium Signaling', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cross-Linking Reagents', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin M/*metabolism', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/classification/*immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Prognosis', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase']",2005/03/08 09:00,2005/04/29 09:00,['2005/03/08 09:00'],"['2005/03/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/29 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['174/6/3749 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.174.6.3749 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2005 Mar 15;174(6):3749-56. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.174.6.3749.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

LPS (TLR4), peptidoglycan (TLR2), R-848 (TLR7/8), and CpG-DNA (TLR9) were equally effective at delaying spontaneous apoptosis of PMN, while PamCSK4 (TLR1/2), macrophage-activating lipopeptide-2 (TLR2/6), flagellin (TLR5), and loxoribine (TLR7) were less effective or inactive. TLR agonists found to delay apoptosis also extended the functional life span of PMN. Analysis of signaling pathways revealed that the antiapoptotic effect of TLR agonists required NF-kappaB and PI3K activation. Furthermore, analysis of intact cells by flow cytometry showed that TLR agonists delaying PMN apoptosis increased phosphorylation of Akt, a major target of PI3K. This effect was associated with a PI3K-dependent increase in heat shock protein 27 phosphorylation, which has been reported to play a key role in PMN survival. Finally, the TLR-induced delay in PMN apoptosis was associated with increased levels of Mcl-1 and A1, which are antiapoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family. These effects were reversed by PI3K and NF-kappaB inhibitors, respectively. TLR activation also led to PI3K-dependent phosphorylation of the proapoptotic protein Bad. Taken together, our results strongly suggest a role of NF-kappaB and PI3K in TLR-induced PMN survival, leading to modulation of Bcl-2 family molecules.","['Francois, Stephanie', 'El Benna, Jamel', 'Dang, Pham M C', 'Pedruzzi, Eric', 'Gougerot-Pocidalo, Marie-Anne', 'Elbim, Carole']","['Francois S', 'El Benna J', 'Dang PM', 'Pedruzzi E', 'Gougerot-Pocidalo MA', 'Elbim C']","['Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (INSERM), Unite 479, Faculte Xavier Bichat, Paris, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (BAD protein, human)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (TLR2 protein, human)', '0 (TLR4 protein, human)', '0 (TLR5 protein, human)', '0 (TLR7 protein, human)', '0 (TLR9 protein, human)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 1)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 2)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 4)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 5)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 7)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 9)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptors)', '0 (bcl-Associated Death Protein)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (AKT1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'EC 3.6.4.- (Replication Protein C)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Carrier Proteins/metabolism', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*agonists', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Neutrophils/*cytology/drug effects/immunology/*physiology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/*agonists', 'Replication Protein C', 'Signal Transduction', 'Toll-Like Receptor 1', 'Toll-Like Receptor 2', 'Toll-Like Receptor 4', 'Toll-Like Receptor 5', 'Toll-Like Receptor 7', 'Toll-Like Receptor 9', 'Toll-Like Receptors', 'bcl-Associated Death Protein']",2005/03/08 09:00,2005/04/29 09:00,['2005/03/08 09:00'],"['2005/03/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/29 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['174/6/3633 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.174.6.3633 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2005 Mar 15;174(6):3633-42. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.174.6.3633.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The interaction of CD8alphaalpha with TL is important for lymphocyte regulation in the intestine. Therefore, we studied the molecular basis for TL Ag binding to CD8alphaalpha. The stronger affinity of the TL Ag for CD8alphaalpha is largely mediated by three amino acids on exposed loops of the conserved alpha3 domain. Mutant classical class I molecules substituted with TL Ag amino acids at these positions mimic the ability to interact with CD8alphaalpha and modulate lymphocyte function.

Specifically, we show that key repressors of the plasmacytic program, B cell leukemia/lymphoma-6 and paired box gene 5, are reduced in spontaneously secreting B-1 B cells, as in stimulated differentiated B-2 cells. Surprisingly, we find that key promoters of the plasmacytic program, B lymphocyte inducer of maturation program 1 and X-box binding protein 1, are not up-regulated in secreting B-1 cells, in contrast to secreting B-2 cells.

Evidence is gradually accumulating which shows that 2-arachidonoylglycerol plays important physiological roles in several mammalian tissues and cells, yet the details remain ambiguous. In this study, we first examined the effects of 2-arachidonoylglycerol on the motility of human natural killer cells. We found that 2-arachidonoylglycerol induces the migration of KHYG-1 cells (a natural killer leukemia cell line) and human peripheral blood natural killer cells. The migration of natural killer cells induced by 2-arachidonoylglycerol was abolished by treating the cells with SR144528, a CB2 receptor antagonist, suggesting that the CB2 receptor is involved in the 2-arachidonoylglycerol-induced migration. In contrast to 2-arachidonoylglycerol, anandamide, another endogenous cannabinoid receptor ligand, did not induce the migration. Delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol, a major psychoactive constituent of marijuana, also failed to induce the migration; instead, the addition of delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol together with 2-arachidonoylglycerol abolished the migration induced by 2-arachidonoylglycerol. It is conceivable that the endogenous ligand for the cannabinoid receptor, that is, 2-arachidonoylglycerol, affects natural killer cell functions such as migration, thereby contributing to the host-defense mechanism against infectious viruses and tumor cells.","['Kishimoto, Seishi', 'Muramatsu, Mayumi', 'Gokoh, Maiko', 'Oka, Saori', 'Waku, Keizo', 'Sugiura, Takayuki']","['Kishimoto S', 'Muramatsu M', 'Gokoh M', 'Oka S', 'Waku K', 'Sugiura T']","['Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Teikyo University, Sagamiko, Kanagawa 199-0195.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,J Biochem,Journal of biochemistry,0376600,"['0 (Arachidonic Acids)', '0 (Camphanes)', '0 (Endocannabinoids)', '0 (Glycerides)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Receptor, Cannabinoid, CB2)', '0 (SR 144528)', '8D239QDW64 (glyceryl 2-arachidonate)']",IM,"['Arachidonic Acids/pharmacology/*physiology', 'Camphanes/pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Movement/drug effects/*physiology', 'Endocannabinoids', 'Glycerides/pharmacology/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/drug effects/*immunology', 'Ligands', 'Pyrazoles/pharmacology', 'Receptor, Cannabinoid, CB2/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*physiology']",2005/03/08 09:00,2005/08/17 09:00,['2005/03/08 09:00'],"['2005/03/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/17 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['137/2/217 [pii]', '10.1093/jb/mvi021 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biochem. 2005 Feb;137(2):217-23. doi: 10.1093/jb/mvi021.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here the interaction between recombinant LEDGF/p75 and HIV-1 IN was examined in a pull-down binding test. LEDGF/p75 was shown to increase the solubility of HIV-1 IN. Next, fluorescent correlation spectroscopy was used to measure the interaction of LEDGF/p75 or the complex of HIV-1 IN and LEDGF/p75 with a specific double-stranded DNA oligonucleotide. Whereas LEDGF/p75 displayed only a moderate affinity for DNA, it strongly promoted the binding of HIV-1 IN to DNA. This effect was specific for the p75 isoform of LEDGF and was not seen with p52. In the pull-down assay LEDGF/p75 interacted with HIV-1, HIV-2, and feline immunodeficiency virus IN, but not with the IN of human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 2, Moloney murine leukemia virus, or Rous sarcoma virus. These results strongly suggest that the interaction of LEDGF/p75 with IN is specific to lentiviridae. LEDGF/p75 stimulated the binding of HIV-1 and HIV-2 IN, but not Moloney murine leukemia virus or Rous sarcoma virus IN, to an aspecific DNA.

However, this fact was based on series treated ineffectually with chlorambucil, which were not stratified according to prognostic markers. DESIGN AND METHODS: The prognosis and clinical course of CLL are heterogeneous. While some patients may have a normal life expectancy without requiring treatment, others die of drug-resistant disease as early as within two years of presentation. However, unlike the situation in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, there is no standard Prognostic Index that can be used to group patients with CLL according to likely outcome or to guide treatment. RESULTS: A number of clinical and biological factors of prognostic relevance, which may add to the classical assessment provided by the staging systems, have been identified. These include clinical characteristics, such as age, gender and performance status, and laboratory parameters reflecting the tumor burden or disease activity, such as lymphocyte count, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) increase, bone marrow infiltration pattern or lymphocyte doubling time. Recently more informative prognostic parameters have been identified: serum markers such as soluble CD23, b2-microglobulin or thymidine kinase and genetic markers of tumor cells, such as genomic aberrations, gene abnormalities (p53, ATM), the mutation status of the variable segments of the immunoglobulin heavy chain genes (IGVH) or surrogate markers for these factors, such as CD38 and ZAP-70. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: From the clinician's perspective the importance of this new knowledge is how it affects treatment. It is now possible to produce molecular remissions even in advanced disease using combinations of purine analogs and monoclonal antibodies. Moreover, potentially curative therapeutic modalities such as autologous and allogeneic stem cell transplantation are becoming safer. Clinical trials of effective treatment stratified by more reliable prognostic markers are surely now warranted.","['Montillo, Marco', 'Hamblin, Terry', 'Hallek, Michael', 'Montserrat, Emili', 'Morra, Enrica']","['Montillo M', 'Hamblin T', 'Hallek M', 'Montserrat E', 'Morra E']","[""Division of Hematology, Niguarda Ca' Granda Hospital, Milan, Italy. ematologia@ospedaleniguarda.it""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,['0 (Biomarkers)'],IM,"['Biomarkers', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*diagnosis/mortality/*therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Assessment']",2005/03/08 09:00,2006/05/24 09:00,['2005/03/08 09:00'],"['2005/03/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/24 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/08 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 2005 Mar;90(3):391-9.,59,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The most specific and sensitive methods for MRD monitoring currently available are polymerase chain reaction amplification of rearranged immunoglobulin and antigen-receptor genes, and flow cytometric detection of aberrant immunophenotypes. Several retrospective studies have demonstrated the strong association between MRD and risk of relapse in childhood acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL), irrespective of the methodology used. The promising results on the predictivity of MRD evaluation at the end of induction treatment has challenged the need for a new definition of remission. There is now urgent need to incorporate MRD data into clinical studies, properly designed to address treatment questions, in order to explore whether a better tailored treatment would result in further improvement in cure rates for children with ALL.

MCR was defined as a reduction of Philadelphia chromosome-positive bone marrow cells to <or= 35%. The New CML score discriminated three risk groups with significantly different survival probabilities. DESIGN AND METHODS: Data from individual patients with a confirmed diagnosis of Philadelphia chromosome-positive CML treated with IFN were collected from 10 prospective studies in Europe and Japan. Stratified for baseline risk group, patients with a major cytogenetic response by 21 months after the start of therapy (n=171) were compared with patients achieving a minor response or less (n=487). Survival probabilities after the landmark at 21 months were compared by using the two-sided log-rank test. RESULTS: MCR was a major predictor for low- and intermediate-risk patients (log-rank test, p <or= 0.0001), but not for high-risk patients. Ten-year survival probabilities for the low- and intermediate-risk patients who had a MCR were 75% (95 CI: 65-86%) and 56% (95 CI: 37-75%), respectively. The corresponding probabilities for patients who did not achieve a MCR were 21% (95 CI: 6-35%) and 16% (95 CI: 6-25%). INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Cytogenetic response per se is not a valid surrogate marker, as it is dependent on the baseline prognostic profile. The combination of risk group and cytogenetic response does, however, provide useful clinical information.

Therefore, we wanted to study the effect of small interfering (siRNA) targeting WT1 in leukemic cells and normal CD34-positive cells with regard to proliferation, induction of apoptosis, and cell differentiation. Furthermore, we wanted to evaluate whether the additional use of BCR-ABL siRNA could increase the anti-leukemic effects of WT1 siRNA in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cells. DESIGN AND METHODS: We measured WT1 expression by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in various cell lines and in leukemic cells from patients, then transfected the cells with WT1-specific and BCR-ABL-specific siRNA before carrying out microarray analysis. We used the tunnel assay to measure apoptotic cells. RESULTS: We observed a reduction of WT1 gene expression, measured by real-time RT-PCR, in all studied cell lines: K-562, Kasumi-1, MV 4-11 and NB-4, as well as in cells of AML and CML patients. The results also demonstrated that WT1 siRNA significantly induced apoptosis and inhibited proliferation in MV4-11 cells, NB-4 cells, Kasumi-1 cells (p<0.01) and in K-562 cells (p<0.02) versus controls. In normal CD34-positive cells, the proliferation was only slightly inhibited (by about 20%) and no induction of apoptosis was found. Combined transfection with WT1 and BCR-ABL siRNA together in K-562 cells increased the inhibition of the rate of proliferation and the rate of induced apoptosis compared to transfection with BCR-ABL siRNA or WT1 siRNA alone (p<0.01). We found that most genes involved in cell signaling and protein metabolism were regulated by the WT1 gene in K-562 cells in a microarray analysis.

RESULTS: EGCG rapidly induced apoptotic cell death in retinoic acid (RA)-resistant acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), UF-1 cells within 3 h. EGCG induced apoptosis in UF-1 cells was in association with the loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potentials (Deltapsim) and activation of caspase-3 and -9. Elevation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production was also demonstrated during EGCG-induced apoptosis of UF-1 as well as fresh myeloid leukemic cells. In NOD/SCID mice transplanted with UF-1 cells, EGCG effectively inhibited tumor growth in vivo, and the number of mitoses among the cells significantly decreased in comparison to that of control mouse cells.

RESULTS: Age-adjusted telomere length in AML patients was significantly reduced as compared to in matched controls, consisting of peripheral blood granulocytes from healthy individuals (0-90 years) (median: -2.5 TFU; p<0.001). Patients with an aberrant karyotype had significantly shorter telomeres than patients with a normal karyotype (median -3.0 vs. -2.3 TFU; p=0.03). The shortest telomeres were found in patients with multiple aberrations (median -3.7 TFU; p=0.03). hTERT expression was found to be correlated with chromosomal abnormalities as well as with the detection of functional hTERT splicing variants. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest an important role of intense telomere loss in the development of genetic instability during the pathogenesis of AML. It is assumed that critical telomere shortening in AML blasts could lead to telomerase activation and therefore prevent blasts from replicative senescence, one possible mechanism for clonal selection and disease progression. Therefore, telomere length might serve as a prognostic marker for AML patients. These findings would have to be confirmed in large, prospective studies.","['Hartmann, Ulrike', 'Brummendorf, Tim H', 'Balabanov, Stefan', 'Thiede, Christian', 'Illme, Thomas', 'Schaich, Markus']","['Hartmann U', 'Brummendorf TH', 'Balabanov S', 'Thiede C', 'Illme T', 'Schaich M']","['Dept. of Hematology and Oncology, University of Tubingen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,['EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Case-Control Studies', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/etiology/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Telomerase/*genetics', 'Telomere/*ultrastructure']",2005/03/08 09:00,2006/05/24 09:00,['2005/03/08 09:00'],"['2005/03/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/24 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/08 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 2005 Mar;90(3):307-16.,,,,,,,['Haematologica. 2005 Mar;90(3):289B.

Different categories of targeted therapies can be identified: 1) Therapies directed at oncogenes that are directly involved in the initiation of neoplastic transformation: the use of imatinib for the treatment of CML or GIST is the classical model in this subgroup. Single agent targeted therapies generally produce high response rates in this situation. 2) Therapies directed at oncogenes involved at a later stage of neoplastic transformation. These oncogenes contribute to tumor progression but not necessarily to the onset of malignant transformation. The use of trastuzumab for HER2-amplified breast adenocarcinoma is the classical model in this subgroup. These treatments are associated with low response rates when used as single agent therapy, whereas generally displaying a synergistic or additive effect with classical chemotherapy in models currently available. In contrast, when these targeted therapies are applied to tumor models where the targeted gene is present but not directly involved in the process of malignant transformation, no antitumor efficacy is generally observed. Recently, the identification of HER1 mutations in subsets of lung carcinoma as a predictive factor for response to gefitinib and erlotinib provided an example of how the empiric use of a targeted treatment may enable to identify new nosological entities. The present paper reviews examples of targeted cancer therapies and their results.","['Blay, Jean-Yves', 'Le Cesne, Axel', 'Alberti, Laurent', 'Ray-Coquart, Isabelle']","['Blay JY', 'Le Cesne A', 'Alberti L', 'Ray-Coquart I']","['Inserm Unit 590, Centre Leon Berard, 28 rue Laennec, 69008 Lyon, France. blay@fnclcc.lyon.fr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,France,Bull Cancer,Bulletin du cancer,0072416,"['0 (Angiogenesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, ErbB-2)']",IM,"['Angiogenesis Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Breast Neoplasms/drug therapy/genetics', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Disease Progression', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors/drug therapy/genetics', 'Gene Amplification', 'Genes, erbB-2/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/genetics', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Neoplasms/blood supply/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic/*drug therapy', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptor, ErbB-2/antagonists & inhibitors']",2005/03/08 09:00,2005/03/12 09:00,['2005/03/08 09:00'],"['2005/03/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/12 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/08 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Bull Cancer. 2005 Feb;92(2):E13-8.,67,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because little information regarding the effect of genistein on hematopoietic malignancies is available, we undertook this study of T-cell lymphomas. We tested the effect of genistein on murine T-cell lines derived from thymic lymphomas induced by an oncogenic murine leukemia virus. When T lymphoma cells were treated with genistein concentrations of 15 microM and greater, it was observed that the percentage of viable cells was significantly reduced in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The observed cell killing was found to be the result of apoptosis as detected by flow cytometric analysis of cells stained with annexin V and propidium iodide and assays for caspase-3 activation and DNA fragmentation. Cell staining with the mitochondrial specific dye JC-1 and detection of caspase-9 activation revealed that genistein produced mitochondrial depolarization as an early step in the induction of apoptosis. Bongkrekic acid inhibition of mitochondrial depolarization identified the mitochondria permeability transition pore (PTP) as a potential target of genistein activity. These results indicate that the induction of apoptosis by pharmacological concentrations of genistein in T lymphoma cells occurs via mitochondrial damage with the involvement of the PTP.","['Baxa, Dwayne M', 'Luo, Xixia', 'Yoshimura, Fayth K']","['Baxa DM', 'Luo X', 'Yoshimura FK']","['Infectious Disease Research, Henry Ford Health System, Detroit, MI 48202, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Nutr Cancer,Nutrition and cancer,7905040,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', 'DH2M523P0H (Genistein)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Casp3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Casp9 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspase 9', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'DNA Fragmentation/*drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Electrophoresis, Agar Gel', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Genistein/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects', 'Time Factors']",2005/03/08 09:00,2005/08/12 09:00,['2005/03/08 09:00'],"['2005/03/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/12 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/08 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1207/s15327914nc5101_13 [doi]'],ppublish,Nutr Cancer. 2005;51(1):93-101. doi: 10.1207/s15327914nc5101_13.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Baalc protein was mainly expressed in developing and mature muscle cells (cardiac, skeletal, and smooth) beginning on day E9 (heart). Signal was seen in the pre-muscle mesodermal cells of the dermatomyotome regions, and the derivatives of the lateral plate and intermediate mesoderm such as smooth muscle wall of the esophagus, stomach, the gut tube, bronchi, small blood vessels, and urinary bladder. This pattern continued through the late embryonic stages into adulthood. Baalc appeared to localize in the cytoplasm, adjacent to the cell membrane. This is distinctly observed in adult skeletal muscle cells. Baalc co-localized with known muscle-associated proteins but not with neural crest or neuronal markers. Scattered expression in adult bone marrow hematopoietic cells and weak expression in the brain neuropil also occurred.

By using PML isoform-specific antibodies, we found PML3-specific association with the centrosome and the pole of the mitotic spindle. PML3 deficiency leads to dysregulation of the centrosome duplication checkpoint. Furthermore, PML3 physically interacts with Aurora A and regulates its kinase activity. Specific knockdown of PML3 activates Cdk2/cyclin kinase activity. The results of this study implicate a direct role for PML3 in the control of centrosome duplication through suppression of Aurora A activation to prevent centrosome reduplication.","['Xu, Zhi-Xiang', 'Zou, Wen-Xin', 'Lin, Pei', 'Chang, Kun-Sang']","['Xu ZX', 'Zou WX', 'Lin P', 'Chang KS']","['Department of Molecular Pathology, Division of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Boulevard, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Mol Cell,Molecular cell,9802571,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (Xenopus Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (AURKA protein, Xenopus)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Aurora Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDC2-CDC28 Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Aurora Kinases', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism', 'CDC2-CDC28 Kinases/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Centrosome/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism', '*Genome', 'Humans', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Mitosis', 'Neoplasm Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*physiology', 'Nuclear Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*physiology', 'Plasmids/metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'Spindle Apparatus', 'Subcellular Fractions/metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Transcription Factors/chemistry/genetics/*physiology', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'U937 Cells', 'Xenopus Proteins']",2005/03/08 09:00,2005/04/12 09:00,['2005/03/08 09:00'],"['2004/08/12 00:00 [received]', '2004/12/22 00:00 [revised]', '2005/02/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/03/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/12 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1097-2765(05)01092-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.molcel.2005.02.014 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell. 2005 Mar 4;17(5):721-32. doi: 10.1016/j.molcel.2005.02.014.,,,,"['CA 55577/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA09963/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, there is a difference in quality of outcome between these two therapeutic modalities. There is no plateau for survival after ATG as patients are at later risk of transformation to myelodysplasia (MDS) or acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria and relapse of their aplasia. In contrast, AA patients are not at risk of these later complications if they have undergone successful bone marrow transplantation. Long term survival after HLA identical sibling BMT is 80-90%, but GVHD and graft rejection remain to be addressed. The results of unrelated donor BMT for AA have shown considerable improvement over the last five years.

In the present study, myricetin (ME) but not its respective glycoside, myricitrin (MI; myricetin-3-O-rhamnose) reduced the viability of human leukemia HL-60 cells via apoptosis, characterized by the occurrence of DNA ladders and hypodiploid cells. Results of Western blotting and caspase activity assays showed that activation of caspases 3 and 9 but not caspases 1, 6 or 8 with cleavage of PARP and D4-GDI proteins is involved in ME-induced apoptosis. A reduction in mitochondrial functions characterized by a decrease in the Bcl-2/Bax protein ratio and translocation of cytochrome c (cyt c) from the mitochondria to the cytosol in accordance with a decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential were observed in ME-treated HL-60 cells. No significant induction of intracellular ROS levels by ME was observed by the DCHF-DA assay, DPPH assay or plasmid digestion assay, and antioxidants including N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC), catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and tiron (TIR) showed no protective effects on ME-induced apoptosis. A PKC activator, 12-O-tetradecaoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) significantly attenuated ME-induced apoptosis via preventing cytochrome c release to the cytosol and maintaining the mitochondrial membrane potential by inhibiting the decrease in the Bcl-2/Bax protein ratio; these effects were blocked by protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitors including GF-109203X, H7, and staurosporin. Removing mitochondria by ethidium bromide (EtBr) treatment reduced the apoptotic effect of ME. Results of SAR studies showed that the presence of OH at C3', C4', and C5' is important for the apoptosis-inducing activities of ME, and that ME induces apoptosis in another leukemia cell line, Jurkat cells, but not in primary human polymorphonuclear (PMN) cells or in murine peritoneal macrophages (PMs). The results of the present study suggest that apoptosis induced by ME occurs through a novel mitochondrion-dependent, ROS-independent pathway; TPA protects cells from ME-induced apoptosis via PKC activation which prevents the occurrence of mitochondrial destruction during apoptosis.","['Ko, Ching Huai', 'Shen, Shing-Chuan', 'Hsu, Chun-Sen', 'Chen, Yen-Chou']","['Ko CH', 'Shen SC', 'Hsu CS', 'Chen YC']","['Graduate Institute of Pharmacy, School of Pharmacy, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '76XC01FTOJ (myricetin)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/physiology', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytochromes c/*metabolism', 'Flavonoids/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase C/*metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/physiology']",2005/03/08 09:00,2005/04/13 09:00,['2005/03/08 09:00'],"['2004/09/24 00:00 [received]', '2004/12/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/03/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-2952(04)00821-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bcp.2004.12.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2005 Mar 15;69(6):913-27. doi: 10.1016/j.bcp.2004.12.005.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Meanwhile the methods to evaluate the VEGF level in the serum of patients with acute leukemia were explored. The levels of bFGF and VEGF in the serum from 32 patients with acute leukemia and 10 healthy subjects and in the supernatants of 5 various human leukemia cell lines were quantified by means of the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and were compared. VEGF levels were evaluated not only without standardization but also after standardized by platelet and finally expressed as VEGF/PLT (pg/10(6)). After with different concentrations of VEGF ASODN, HL-60 cell viability was examined with MTT assay and VEGF levels in supernatants were measured with ELISA, respectively. The results showed that bFGF was detected (3 pg/ml) in 14 out of 32 serum samples from patients with acute leukemia, and the positive (37.5%) was significantly higher than that in healthy controls (10%) (P < 0.01). 3 out of 5 supernanant samples obtained from leukemia cell lines demonstrated positive for bFGF as well. There is no difference of the serum VEGF levels between leukemia patients and healthy controls, but the serum VEGF levels in the serum from leukemia patients were significantly higher than those in healthy controls (P < 0.05) after standardization. 4 out of 5 leukemia cell (U937 excluded) were found to express VEGF in the supernanant. After exposure of HL-60 cells to VEGF ASODN at a concentration of 0.5, 1 and 5 micromol/L for 24 hours, the cell viability gradually dropped down to lower levels (P < 0.05 vs controls). After treatment of HL-60 cells with VEGF ASODN at a concentration of 1, 5 and 20 micromol/L for 24 hours, the VEGF levels in supernatants of target cells decreased (P < 0.05 vs controls). The patients with acute leukemia represented the higher levels of serum bFGF and VEGF than controls. Most of leukemia cell lines expressed bFGF and VEGF at different levels. It is concluded that bFGF and VEGF both have effects on regulations of angiogenesis in acute leukemia, but VEGF plays a pivotal role. VEGF-specific ASODN may have a role in them VEGF expression downregulated.

Fourteen AML1/ETO positive children out of 52 AML children were selected. A serial dilution of AML1/ETO plasmid was used as a template for the AML1/ETO real-time PCR. AML1/ETO was quantified according to the expression of the GAPDH housekeeping gene at new diagnosis and during/after chemotherapy and transplantation. SPSS statistics was used to analyze the data. The results showed that the ratio of AML1/ETO: GAPDH expression level at new diagnosis varied in the range 0.219-2.080 (median 0.648) among the patients, without relevance with percentage of blasts. The detection sensitivity was up to the dilution of 1:10(5). Six patients showed a slight decline of AML1/ETO (higher than 5 x 10(-2)) at 1 month, three of whom relapsed in the early stage and one later. Five patients had a higher level than 5 x 10(-3) at 3 months, three of whom relapsed. Four patients with always a higher level than 5 x 10(-3) all relapsed in early stage. After six months, four out of them with constant low-level expression (10(-4) - 10(-6)) were in continuous complete hematological remission (CCR).

Nonmyeloablative conditioning regimens consisted of CTX, Ara-C and ATG. The patients were given cyclosporine A and mycophenolate mofetile for prophylaxis of acute GVHD. The ABO-incompatible patients received grafts depleted erythrocytes by hydroxyethyl starch (HES) sedimentation. The results showed that successful and stable engraftment was established in 23 patients. No recipient developed clinically immediate hemolysis during graft infusion, but 2 recipients experienced delayed hemolysis attributable to the ABO incompatibility. The median time of granulocyte counts >0.5 x 10(9)/L and platelet >30 x 10(9)/L was 11 and 14.9 days, respectively. In ABO major incompatible group, the onset of erythropoiesis after NAST was delayed. One out of 10 recipients with blood group ""O"" in this group developed pure red cell aplasia (PRCA), lasting 5 months. The acute GVHD occurred in 7 out of the 24 patients. The chronic GVHD occurred in 5 of 21 cases. Relapse was observed in 2 patients with acute leukemia. The actuarial probability of disease-free survival at 2 years was 63.3%. In conclusion, ABO-incompatible grafts for NAST have no adverse effect on engraftment, recovery of platelets, incidence of GVHD, relapse rate or survival.

Several techniques have been reported for this purpose. PCR-based assays analyzing polymorphic short tandem repeats (STR) as markers are attractive because they are sensitive and can be performed rapidly. The intent of this study was to test a novel approach for assessment of donor engraftment using denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) combined with STR-PCR. The feasibility of this assay and the accuracy of semi-quantitative results were tested in-vitro by using serial DNA mixtures from unrelated individuals. The results showed that dilution experiments of the mock chimerism sample revealed a clear correlation between the percentage of donor or recipient DNA and the proportion of allele peak areas, with the limit of detection for a minor DNA percentage being 5%. Discrimination between donor and recipient was possible in all patients analyzed (n = 51) except for 5 patients whose pre-transplant samples were not available and identical twins in one case. STR results were the same as values obtained by capillary electrophoresis combined with fluorescence labeling multiply PCR. Results were also compared with data obtained with FISH analysis in a subgroup of patients receiving grafts from sex-mismatched donors or with PCR-detectable disease-specific gene products analysis. The results of the microsatellite analysis correlated well with the corresponding clinical findings. Full donor chimerism (FDC) were detected in all patients; decreasing values of donor chimerism were detected concomitantly with the appearance of relapse of disease in 3 patients. Samples from eight patients receiving HLA mismatched-haploidentical transplants from related donors together with cord blood transplants from unrelated donors were analyzed by this method.

Our group first discovered in the world the variant chromosome translocation t(11;17)(q23;q21) of APL, and cloned the PML-RAR alpha, PLZF-RAR alpha and NPM-RAR alpha fusion genes corresponding to the characterized chromosome translocations t(15;17); t(11;17) and t(5;17) in APL. Moreover, establishment of transgenic mice model of APL proved their effects on leukemogenesis. The ability of ATRA to modify the recruitment of nuclear receptor co-repressor with PML-RAR alpha but not PLZF-RAR alpha caused by the variant chromosome translocation elucidated the therapeutic mechanism of ATRA from the molecular level and provides new insight into transcription-modulating therapy. Since 1994, our group has successfully applied arsenic trioxide (As(2)O(3)) in treating relapsed APL patients, with the complete remission rate of 70% - 80%. The molecular mechanism study revealed that As(2)O(3) exerts a dose-dependent dual effect on APL. Low-dose As(2)O(3) induced partial differentiation of APL cells, while the higher dose induced apoptosis. As(2)O(3) binds ubiquitin like SUMO-1 through the lysine 160 of PML, resulting in the degradation of PML-RAR alpha. Taken together, ATRA and As(2)O(3) target the transcription factor PML-RAR alpha, the former by retinoic acid receptor and the latter by PML sumolization, both induce PML-RAR alpha degradation and APL cells differentiation and apoptosis. Because of the different acting pathways, ATRA and As(2)O(3) have no cross-resistance and can be used as combination therapy. Clinical trial in newly diagnosed APL patients showed that ATRA/As(2)O(3) in combination yields a longer disease-free survival time. With the median survival of 18 months, none of the 20 cases in combination treatment relapsed, whereas 7 relapsed in 37 cases in mono-treatment. This is the best clinical effect achieved in treating adult acute leukemia to this day, possibly making APL the first adult curable leukemia. Based on the great success of the pathogenetic gene target therapy in APL, this strategy may extend to other leukemias. Combination of Gleevec and arsenic agents in treating chronic myeloid leukemia has already make a figure both in clinical and laboratory research, aiming at counteracting the abnormal tyrosine kinase activity of ABL and the degradating BCR-ABL fusion protein. In acute myeloid leukemia M(2b), using new target therapy degradating AML1-ETO fusion protein and reducing the abnormal tyrosine kinase activity of c-kit will also lead to new therapeutic management in acute leukemias.","['Chen, Sai-Juan', 'Chen, Li-Juan', 'Zhou, Guang-Biao']","['Chen SJ', 'Chen LJ', 'Zhou GB']",,['chi'],"['Editorial', 'English Abstract']",,China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/metabolism', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/genetics/metabolism', 'Tretinoin/*therapeutic use']",2005/03/08 09:00,2008/08/19 09:00,['2005/03/08 09:00'],"['2005/03/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/19 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/08 09:00 [entrez]']",['1009-2137(2005)01-0001-08 [pii]'],ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2005 Feb;13(1):1-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Effective approaches to therapy were not instituted until arsenic was first administered in 1865. Since then, four major therapeutic milestones have been achieved; the development of alkylating agents like busulphan and 6-thioguanine in 1953, alpha interferon in 1983, bone marrow transplantation in 1986, and tyrosine kinase inhibitors in 1998. The discovery that the protein product of this fusion gene expresses constitutive tyrosine kinase activity prompted the synthesis of a designer drug, imatinib mesylate, which binds the fusion protein and neutralizes the tyrosine kinase activity. Molecular methods of detecting BCR-ABL transcripts are showing promise in confirming drug resistance and predicting patient outcomes in response to imatinib mesylate therapy. Evidence of drug resistance can guide physicians in selecting alternative therapeutic approaches early in the course of the disease to potentially rescue non responders. Although the success of clinical trials has been dramatic, drug resistance and disease relapse are issues to be considered. CONCLUSION: The discovery that the BCR/ABL fusion protein exhibits increased and constitutive tyrosine kinase activity led investigators to develop an inhibitor to this activity. The synthesis of imatinib mesylate, currently marketed as Gleevec(TM) or Glivec(R), is in stage III clinical trials and has proven to be the most successful antileukemic drug to date. As in CML, an understanding of the leukemogenic mechanisms involved in other leukemias will provide the groundwork for the development of therapeutic interventions tailored to the specific molecular defects identified, eventually rendering obsolete the shotgun approaches to massive cell killing produced by chemotherapy.","['Randolph, Tim R']",['Randolph TR'],"['Department of Clinical Laboratory Science, Doisy School of Allied Health Professions, Saint Louis University Health Sciences Center, 3437 Caroline St, St Louis, MO 63104-1111, USA.

Diagnosis of CML was dramatically improved with the discovery of the Philadelphia chromosome by Nowell and Hungerford in 1960. However, the rudiments of our understanding of the molecular cause of CML began in 1973 when Janet Rowley discovered that the Philadelphia chromosome is a reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22. The leukemogenic mechanisms of CML were hypothesized 20 years later when it was discovered that the t(9;22) translocation produced a fusion gene involving the BCR gene from chromosome 22 and the ABL protooncogene from chromosome 9 [corrected] Multiple breakpoints in BCR produce fusion genes that are translated into chimeric protein products of different lengths that are associated with different leukemic subtypes. CONCLUSION: Although CML has a rich history of interest to hematologists, it also represents a leukemogenic paradigm to the molecular biologist. Nearly all malignancies result from a series of mutagenic events, which culminate in full malignant transformation. However, it appears that CML results from a single mutagenic event involving the t(9;22) translocation leading to the development of the BCR/ABL fusion gene and the corresponding fusion protein. The successful transcription and translation of the BCR/ABL fusion protein led researchers to carefully study its involvement in leukemogenesis. The BCR/ABL fusion protein exhibits increased and constitutive tyrosine kinase activity that differs depending on which BCR breakpoint is expressed, resulting in varying clinical presentations.","['Randolph, Tim R']",['Randolph TR'],"['Department of Clinical Laboratory Science, Doisy School of Allied Health Professions, Saint Louis University Health Sciences Center, 3437 Caroline St, St Louis, MO 63104-1111, USA.

The leukemic cells have an abnormal survival advantage. Thus, the bone marrow and peripheral blood are characterized by leukocytosis with a predominance of immature cells, primarily blasts. As the immature cells accumulate in the bone marrow, they replace the normal myelocytic cells, megakaryocytes, and erythrocytic cells. This leads to a loss of normal bone marrow function and associated complications of bleeding, anemia, and infection. The incidence of AML increases with age, peaking in the sixth decade of life. In the United States, there are about 10,000 new cases of AML and 7,000 deaths in those with an AML diagnosis per year. Current molecular studies of AML demonstrate that it is a heterogeneous disorder of the myeloid cell lineage. This paper will discuss the most recent understanding and research of the cellular origin of AML and associated common genetic mutations that fuel the neoplastic process. Also discussed are how these advances have impacted the classification, selection of therapy, and definition of complete remission in AML.

Early studies demonstrated high rates of hematologic and cytogenetic responses in all phases of the disease after limited observation periods. METHODS: The authors evaluated long-term outcome, rates of response, and resistance in 300 patients with BCR-ABL-positive leukemias (CML in chronic phase after failure to respond to interferon-alpha [CP], n = 139; accelerated phase [AP], n = 80; myeloid blast crisis [BC], n = 76; lymphoid BC and Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia, n = 5) who entered clinical trials with imatinib in a single center after an observation time of 4.5 years. RESULTS: In CP, hematologic remission was achieved in 97% and major (MCR) and complete cytogenetic remission (CCR) in 61% and 49% of patients, respectively. The chance to achieve MCR was higher in patients commencing imatinib earlier in the course of CML. In AP, the median survival period after the start of imatinib was 44 months, and MCR and CCR were observed in 31% and 26% of patients, respectively. In myeloid BC, the median survival period after the start of imatinib and after diagnosis of BC was 6 and 9 months, respectively. Hematologic resistance occurred in 25%, 41%, and 92% of patients in CP, AP, and myeloid BC, respectively, and was associated with BCR-ABL mutations in 45% of patients and with clonal evolution in 58% of patients. CONCLUSIONS: The data emphasized the need for a prolonged follow-up of patients treated with imatinib to define the clinical potential of the drug and to establish methods to optimize therapy.","['Lahaye, Tanja', 'Riehm, Birte', 'Berger, Ute', 'Paschka, Peter', 'Muller, Martin C', 'Kreil, Sebastian', 'Merx, Kirsten', 'Schwindel, Uwe', 'Schoch, Claudia', 'Hehlmann, Rudiger', 'Hochhaus, Andreas']","['Lahaye T', 'Riehm B', 'Berger U', 'Paschka P', 'Muller MC', 'Kreil S', 'Merx K', 'Schwindel U', 'Schoch C', 'Hehlmann R', 'Hochhaus A']","['III.

Previous studies have shown a significant statistical correlation between NQO1 enzymatic activity and the cytotoxicity of certain antitumor quinones. RH1 [2,5-diaziridinyl-3-(hydroxymethyl)-6-methyl-1,4-benzoquinone], presently in late preclinical and entering early clinical development, has been previously considered to be an excellent substrate for activation by NQO1. In this study we investigate the cytotoxicity of RH1 in cell lines selected from the NCI's 60 tumor cell line panel, expressing varying levels of NQO1 activity. Exposure time- and concentration-dependent cytotoxicity was seen, apparently independent from levels of NQO1 activity in these cells. Furthermore, the NQO1 inhibitor dicoumarol had no impact on the sensitivity profiles of RH1 response. The HL-60 myeloid leukemia cells, which do not have detectable NQO1 activity, were further investigated. RH1 treatment of HL-60 cells generated high levels of free radicals, which was accompanied by robust redox cycling, oxygen consumption and induction of apoptosis. These results are in agreement with previous data suggesting that, in addition to its activation by NQO1, RH1-induced cytotoxicity might involve alternative pathways for activation of this compound. Furthermore, the high cytotoxicity of RH1 in the leukemia/lymphoma subpanel of the NCI in vitro cell line screen would suggest an empirical rationale for the utilization of this compound in the treatment of these malignancies.","['Tudor, Gabriela', 'Alley, Mike', 'Nelson, Christopher M', 'Huang, Ruili', 'Covell, David G', 'Gutierrez, Peter', 'Sausville, Edward A']","['Tudor G', 'Alley M', 'Nelson CM', 'Huang R', 'Covell DG', 'Gutierrez P', 'Sausville EA']","['Science Applications International Corp., National Cancer Institute, Frederick, MD, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,England,Anticancer Drugs,Anti-cancer drugs,9100823,"['0 (2,5-diaziridinyl-3-(hydroxymethyl)-6-methyl-1,4-benzoquinone)', '0 (Aziridines)', '0 (Benzoquinones)', '0 (Free Radicals)', 'EC 1.6.5.2 (NAD(P)H Dehydrogenase (Quinone))', 'EC 1.6.5.2 (NQO1 protein, human)', 'S88TT14065 (Oxygen)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Aziridines/*toxicity', 'Benzoquinones/*toxicity', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Free Radicals/metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'NAD(P)H Dehydrogenase (Quinone)/*metabolism', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Oxidative Stress/*drug effects', 'Oxygen/metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Transfection']",2005/03/05 09:00,2005/07/06 09:00,['2005/03/05 09:00'],"['2005/03/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/06 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['00001813-200504000-00004 [pii]', '10.1097/00001813-200504000-00004 [doi]']",ppublish,Anticancer Drugs. 2005 Apr;16(4):381-91. doi: 10.1097/00001813-200504000-00004.,,,,['N01-C0-56000/PHS HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the activated alpha-subunit of G(12) has been shown to interact directly with a number of protein effectors, the roles of many of these protein-protein interactions in G(12)-mediated cell physiology are poorly understood. To begin dissecting the specific cellular pathways engaged upon G(12) activation, we produced a series of substitution mutants in the regions of Galpha(12) predicted to play a role in effector binding. Here we report the identification and characterization of an altered form of Galpha(12) that is functionally uncoupled from signaling through the monomeric G protein Rho, a protein known to propagate several Galpha(12)-mediated signals. This mutant of Galpha(12) fails to bind the Rho-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factors p115RhoGEF and LARG (leukemia-associated RhoGEF), fails to stimulate Rho-dependent transcriptional activation, and fails to trigger activation of RhoA and the Rho-mediated cellular responses of cell rounding and c-jun N-terminal kinase activation. Importantly, this mutant of Galpha(12) retains coupling to the effector protein E-cadherin, as evidenced by its ability both to bind E-cadherin in vitro and to disrupt E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion. Furthermore, this mutant retains the ability to trigger beta-catenin release from the cytoplasmic domain of cadherin. This identification of a variant of Galpha(12) that is selectively uncoupled from one signaling pathway while retaining signaling capacity through a separate pathway will facilitate investigations into the mechanisms through which G(12) proteins mediate diverse biological responses.","['Meigs, Thomas E', 'Juneja, Juhi', 'DeMarco, C Todd', 'Stemmle, Laura N', 'Kaplan, Daniel D', 'Casey, Patrick J']","['Meigs TE', 'Juneja J', 'DeMarco CT', 'Stemmle LN', 'Kaplan DD', 'Casey PJ']","['Department of Pharmacology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina 27710, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",20050303,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Cadherins)', '0 (Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors)', '0 (Rho Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors)', 'EC 3.6.5.1 (GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits, G12-G13)']",IM,"['Cadherins/physiology', 'Cell Line', 'GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits, G12-G13/*metabolism', 'Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Protein Binding/physiology', 'Rho Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology']",2005/03/05 09:00,2005/09/03 09:00,['2005/03/05 09:00'],"['2005/03/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/03 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(20)65751-9 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M500445200 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2005 May 6;280(18):18049-55. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M500445200.

To gain further insights into the relevant mechanisms and to detect possible functional differences between both proteins, we conditionally expressed p21(Cip1) and p27(Kip1) in K562, a multipotent human leukemia cell line. Temporal ectopic expression of either p21(Cip1) or p27(Kip1) arrested proliferation, inhibited Cdk2 and Cdk4 activities, and suppressed retinoblastoma phosphorylation. However, whereas p21(Cip1) arrested cells in both G(1) and G(2) cell cycle phases, p27(Kip1) blocked the G(1)/S-phase transition. Furthermore, although both p21(Cip1) and p27(Kip1) associated with Cdk6, only p27(Kip1) significantly inhibited its activity. Most importantly, each protein promoted differentiation along a distinct pathway; p21(Cip1) triggered megakaryocytic maturation, whereas p27(Kip1) resulted in the expression of erythroid markers. Consistently, p21(Cip1) and p27(Kip1) were rapid and transiently up-regulated when K562 cells are differentiated into megakaryocytic and erythroid lineages, respectively. These findings demonstrate distinct functions of p21(Cip1) and p27(Kip1) in cell cycle regulation and differentiation and indicate that these two highly related proteins possess unique biological activities and are not functionally interchangeable.","['Munoz-Alonso, Maria J', 'Acosta, Juan C', 'Richard, Carlos', 'Delgado, M Dolores', 'Sedivy, John', 'Leon, Javier']","['Munoz-Alonso MJ', 'Acosta JC', 'Richard C', 'Delgado MD', 'Sedivy J', 'Leon J']","['Grupo de Biologia Molecular del Cancer, Departamento de Biologia Molecular y Unidad de Biomedicina-Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas, Universidad de Cantabria, 39011 Santander, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",20050303,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (CDKN1B protein, human)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)']",IM,"['Carrier Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Cell Cycle/*physiology', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Cell Differentiation/*physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/*metabolism/pathology']",2005/03/05 09:00,2005/09/03 09:00,['2005/03/05 09:00'],"['2005/03/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/03 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(20)65759-3 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M500758200 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2005 May 6;280(18):18120-9. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M500758200.

We analyzed telomere length, V(H) gene mutation status, and clinical parameters in a large series of CLL. Telomere length was assessed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR), giving a very good correlation to telomere length estimated by Southern blotting (P < .001). The prognostic information given by mutation status (n = 282) and telomere length (n = 246) was significant (P < .001, respectively). Telomere length was a prognostic factor for stage A (P = .021) and stage B/C (P = .018) patients, whereas mutation status predicted outcome only in stage A patients (P < .001). Furthermore, mutated CLLs were subdivided by telomere length into 2 groups with different prognoses (P = .003), a subdivision not seen for unmutated cases (P = .232). Interestingly, the V(H)-mutated group with short telomeres had an overall survival close to that of the unmutated cases.

Juxtamembrane domain mutations are common in gastrointestinal stromal tumors, whereas mutations in the kinase activation loop, most commonly D816V, are seen in systemic mastocytosis and acute myelogenous leukemia. Kit activation-loop mutants are insensitive to imatinib mesylate and have been largely resistant to targeted inhibition. We determined the sensitivities of both Kit mutant classes to the adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-based inhibitors AP23464 and AP23848. In cell lines expressing activation-loop mutants, low-nM concentrations of AP23464 inhibited phosphorylation of Kit and its downstream targets Akt and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3). This was associated with cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis. Wild-type Kit-and juxtamembrane-mutant-expressing cell lines required considerably higher concentrations for equivalent inhibition, suggesting a therapeutic window in which cells harboring D816V Kit could be eliminated without interfering with normal cellular function. Additionally, AP23464 did not disrupt normal hematopoietic progenitor-cell growth at concentrations that inhibited activation-loop mutants of Kit. In a murine model, AP23848 inhibited activation-loop mutant Kit phosphorylation and tumor growth. Thus, AP23464 and AP23848 potently and selectively target activation-loop mutants of Kit in vitro and in vivo and could have therapeutic potential against D816V-expressing malignancies.","['Corbin, Amie S', 'Demehri, Shadmehr', 'Griswold, Ian J', 'Wang, Yihan', 'Metcalf, Chester A 3rd', 'Sundaramoorthi, Raji', 'Shakespeare, William C', 'Snodgrass, Joseph', 'Wardwell, Scott', 'Dalgarno, David', 'Iuliucci, John', 'Sawyer, Tomi K', 'Heinrich, Michael C', 'Druker, Brian J', 'Deininger, Michael W N']","['Corbin AS', 'Demehri S', 'Griswold IJ', 'Wang Y', 'Metcalf CA 3rd', 'Sundaramoorthi R', 'Shakespeare WC', 'Snodgrass J', 'Wardwell S', 'Dalgarno D', 'Iuliucci J', 'Sawyer TK', 'Heinrich MC', 'Druker BJ', 'Deininger MW']","['Oregon Health and Science University, Cancer Institute, L592, 3181 SW Sam Jackson Park Rd, Portland, OR 97239, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20050303,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (AP23464)', '0 (AP23848)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/cytology', 'Cell Division/drug effects/immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/cytology/drug effects', 'Mice', 'Mutagenesis', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/chemistry/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects']",2005/03/05 09:00,2005/08/02 09:00,['2005/03/05 09:00'],"['2005/03/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/02 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)53347-8 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2004-12-4771 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2005 Jul 1;106(1):227-34. doi: 10.1182/blood-2004-12-4771.

While c-Kit(hi)IL-7Ralpha- progenitors are absent, c-Kit(lo)IL-7Ralpha+ progenitors are abundant in the lymph nodes (LNs). c-Kit(lo)IL-7Ralpha+ progenitors undergo abortive T-cell commitment in the LNs and become arrested in the G1 phase of the cell cycle because they fail both to up-regulate c-myb, c-myc, and cyclin D2 and to repress junB, p16(INK4a), and p21(Cip1/WAF). As a result, development of LN c-Kit(lo)IL-7Ralpha+ progenitors is blocked at an intermediate CD44+CD25lo development stage in vivo, and LN-derived progenitors fail to generate mature T cells when cultured with OP9-DL1 stromal cells. LN stroma can provide key signals for T-cell development including IL-7, Kit ligand, and Delta-like-1 but lacks Wnt4 and Wnt7b transcripts. LN c-Kit(lo)IL-7Ralpha+ progenitors are able to generate mature T cells when cultured with stromal cells producing wingless-related MMTV integration site 4 (Wnt4) or upon in vivo exposure to oncostatin M whose signaling pathway intersects with Wnt. Thus, supplying Wnt signals to c-Kit(lo)IL-7Ralpha+ progenitors may be sufficient to transform the LN into a primary T-lymphoid organ.

A total of seven peptides were designed and examined for their HLA-A2.1 affinity and immunogenicity. Of these peptides, we identified two highly immunogenic HLA-A2.1-specific peptides, CD19(150-158) (KLMSPKLYV) and CD20(188-196) (SLFLGILSV), which were capable of inducing peptide-specific CTLs. The CTLs displayed HLA-A2.1-restricted and antigen-specific cytotoxicity against Burkitt's lymphoma, chronic B cell leukemia, and multiple myeloma cell lines. The CD19 or CD20 peptide-specific CTL cytotoxicity was confirmed using HLA-A2.1(+) T2 cells presenting the appropriate peptide. No cytotoxic activity was observed against T2 cells presenting the irrelevant MAGE-3 peptide or T2 cells alone. In addition, the CTLs displayed a significant (P < 0.05) increase in cell proliferation and IFN-gamma secretion (>830 ng/mL) following restimulation with HLA-A2.1(+)/CD19(+)/CD20(+) tumor cells. The CTLs also displayed a distinct phenotype consisting of a high percentage of CD69(+)/CD45RO(+) and a low percentage of CD45RA(+)/CCR7(+) CD4(+) or CD8(+) T cells characteristic of effector memory cell population. Cyclic guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate culture conditions using serum-free AIM-V medium containing human AB serum, recombinant human interleukin 2 (Proleukin) and CD3/CD28 Dynabeads were developed resulting in a 35-fold expansion of CD20 peptide-specific CTLs. The expanded CD20-CTLs retained their cytotoxic activity (28-49%) against the Burkitt's lymphoma cell line. In conclusion, we report here on the identification of novel immunogenic CD19(150-158) (KLMSPKLYV) and CD20(188-196) (SLFLGILSV) peptides that have immunotherapeutic potentials as peptide vaccines or targeted T-cell therapies for treating B-cell malignancies.","['Bae, Jooeun', 'Martinson, Jeffrey A', 'Klingemann, Hans G']","['Bae J', 'Martinson JA', 'Klingemann HG']","['Section of Bone Marrow Transplant and Cell Therapy, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, IL, USA. jooeum_bae@dfci.harvard.edu']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Antigens, CD20)', '0 (HLA-A2 Antigen)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Receptors, Complement 3d)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antigens, CD19/chemistry/immunology', 'Antigens, CD20/chemistry/immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology/pathology', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/cytology/immunology/metabolism', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/cytology/immunology/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/immunology', 'HLA-A2 Antigen/immunology', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/metabolism', 'K562 Cells', 'Oligopeptides/*immunology', 'Receptors, Complement 3d/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/cytology/*immunology/metabolism']",2005/03/05 09:00,2005/07/29 09:00,['2005/03/05 09:00'],"['2005/03/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/29 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['11/4/1629 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-04-1612 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2005 Feb 15;11(4):1629-38. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-04-1612.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A bioactivation product of MMDX, 3'-deamino-3'',4'-anhydro-[2''(S)-methoxy-3''(R)-oxy-4''-morpholinyl]doxorubicin (PNU-159682), has been recently identified in an incubate of the drug with NADPH-supplemented rat liver microsomes. The aims of this study were to obtain information about MMDX biotransformation to PNU-159682 in humans, and to explore the antitumor activity of PNU-159682. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Human liver microsomes (HLM) and microsomes from genetically engineered cell lines expressing individual human cytochrome P450s (CYP) were used to study MMDX biotransformation. We also examined the cytotoxicity and antitumor activity of PNU-159682 using a panel of in vitro-cultured human tumor cell lines and tumor-bearing mice, respectively. RESULTS: HLMs converted MMDX to a major metabolite, whose retention time in liquid chromatography and ion fragmentation in tandem mass spectrometry were identical to those of synthetic PNU-159682. In a bank of HLMs from 10 donors, rates of PNU-159682 formation correlated significantly with three distinct CYP3A-mediated activities. Troleandomycin and ketoconazole, both inhibitors of CYP3A, markedly reduced PNU-159682 formation by HLMs; the reaction was also concentration-dependently inhibited by a monoclonal antibody to CYP3A4/5. Of the 10 cDNA-expressed CYPs examined, only CYP3A4 formed PNU-159682. In addition, PNU-159682 was remarkably more cytotoxic than MMDX and doxorubicin in vitro, and was effective in the two in vivo tumor models tested, i.e., disseminated murine L1210 leukemia and MX-1 human mammary carcinoma xenografts. CONCLUSIONS: CYP3A4, the major CYP in human liver, converts MMDX to a more cytotoxic metabolite, PNU-159682, which retains antitumor activity in vivo.","['Quintieri, Luigi', 'Geroni, Cristina', 'Fantin, Marianna', 'Battaglia, Rosangela', 'Rosato, Antonio', 'Speed, William', 'Zanovello, Paola', 'Floreani, Maura']","['Quintieri L', 'Geroni C', 'Fantin M', 'Battaglia R', 'Rosato A', 'Speed W', 'Zanovello P', 'Floreani M']","['Department of Pharmacology and Anesthesiology, University of Padua, Largo Meneghetti 2, I-35131 Padua, Italy. luigi.quintieri@unipd.it']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"[""0 (3'-deamino-3'',4'-anhydro-(2''-methoxy-3''-oxy-4''-morpholinyl)doxorubicin)"", '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Carbon Radioisotopes)', '108852-90-0 (methoxy-morpholinyl-doxorubicin)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '9035-51-2 (Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (CYP3A protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A)', 'EC 1.14.14.55 (CYP3A4 protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Carbon Radioisotopes', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Doxorubicin/*analogs & derivatives/chemistry/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Female', 'HT29 Cells', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Kinetics', 'Mass Spectrometry/methods', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Microsomes, Liver/enzymology/*metabolism', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2005/03/05 09:00,2005/07/29 09:00,['2005/03/05 09:00'],"['2005/03/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/29 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['11/4/1608 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-04-1845 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2005 Feb 15;11(4):1608-17. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-04-1845.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HA22 is a mutant of BL22 with mutations in heavy-chain CDR3 resulting in increased cytotoxic activity. Our goal was to improve the activity of HA22. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Arg(490), which is located in the catalytic domain (III) of the immunotoxin HA22, was mutated to alanine. Purified immunotoxins were produced and tested for cytotoxic activity in cell culture and for antitumor activity and nonspecific toxicity in mice. ADP-ribosylation activity was also measured. RESULTS: HA22 (R490A) is approximately 2-fold more cytotoxic than HA22 on several CD22-positive cell lines. When injected i.v., HA22 (R490A) has more potent antitumor activity than HA22 against CA46 tumors in mice. HA22 and HA22 (R490A) have similar LD(50)s (approximately 1.3 mg/kg) and similar plasma half-lives. The R490A mutation also improved the cytotoxicity of the antimesothelin recombinant immunotoxin SS1 (dsFv)-PE38 (SS1P). In vitro ADP-ribosylation assays show that HA22 R490A has increased activity. Increased cytotoxic activity is probably related to this increase in ADP-ribosylation activity. CONCLUSION: Protein engineering can be used to increase the efficacy of recombinant immunotoxins. Because HA22 (R490A) has increased antitumor activity without increased animal toxicity, immunotoxins with this mutation are candidates for clinical development.","['Bang, Sookhee', 'Nagata, Satoshi', 'Onda, Masanori', 'Kreitman, Robert J', 'Pastan, Ira']","['Bang S', 'Nagata S', 'Onda M', 'Kreitman RJ', 'Pastan I']","['Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, NIH, 37 Convent Drive, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Bacterial Toxins)', '0 (CD22 protein, human)', '0 (Cd22 protein, mouse)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Enterotoxins)', '0 (Exotoxins)', '0 (GPI-Linked Proteins)', '0 (Immunotoxins)', '0 (Lectins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (RFB4(dsFv)-PE38 recombinant immunotoxin)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 2)', '20762-30-5 (Adenosine Diphosphate Ribose)', 'J27WDC343N (Mesothelin)']",IM,"['Adenosine Diphosphate Ribose/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Antibodies', 'Antigens, CD/genetics/immunology', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/genetics/immunology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Bacterial Toxins/genetics', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/genetics/immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Enterotoxins', 'Exotoxins/genetics', 'Female', 'GPI-Linked Proteins', 'Humans', 'Immunotoxins/genetics/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Lectins/genetics/immunology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/genetics/immunology', 'Mesothelin', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Mutation', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 2', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2005/03/05 09:00,2005/07/29 09:00,['2005/03/05 09:00'],"['2005/03/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/29 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['11/4/1545 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-04-1939 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2005 Feb 15;11(4):1545-50. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-04-1939.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Synthetic CpG oligodeoxynucleotides are currently being tested in clinical trials for the therapy of different types of B cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. However, there is only limited information on the CpG oligodeoxynucleotide sensitivity of primary malignant B cells of different non-Hodgkin's lymphoma entities. Here we found that most B-cell malignancies except plasmacytoma respond to CpG oligodeoxynucleotides by up-regulating expression of costimulatory and antigen-presenting molecules, by increasing expression of CD20, and by proliferation. In an in vitro analysis of 41 individual patient-derived primary tumor samples, B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) and marginal zone lymphoma showed the strongest activation upon stimulation with CpG oligodeoxynucleotides. Small lymphocytic lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma, and large cell lymphoma showed an intermediate response. Consistent with CpG oligodeoxynucleotides sensitivity, TLR9 mRNA was present in B-CLL but absent in plasmacytoma. Although CpG oligodeoxynucleotides induced proliferation in all CpG oligodeoxynucleotide-sensitive types of B-cell malignancies, proliferation was weaker than in normal B cells and at least for B-CLL was followed by increased apoptosis. In conclusion, B-cell malignancies show significant differences in their responsiveness to CpG oligodeoxynucleotides. Focusing clinical studies on patients with highly CpG oligodeoxynucleotide-sensitive B-cell malignancies may improve the clinical outcome of such trials.","['Jahrsdorfer, Bernd', 'Muhlenhoff, Lars', 'Blackwell, Sue E', 'Wagner, Moritz', 'Poeck, Hendrik', 'Hartmann, Evelyn', 'Jox, Ralf', 'Giese, Thomas', 'Emmerich, Bertold', 'Endres, Stefan', 'Weiner, George J', 'Hartmann, Gunther']","['Jahrsdorfer B', 'Muhlenhoff L', 'Blackwell SE', 'Wagner M', 'Poeck H', 'Hartmann E', 'Jox R', 'Giese T', 'Emmerich B', 'Endres S', 'Weiner GJ', 'Hartmann G']","['Holden Comprehensive Cancer Center and Department of Internal Medicine, University of Iowa, Iowa City, Iowa, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Adjuvants, Immunologic)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Antigens, CD20)', '0 (CPG-oligonucleotide)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (TLR9 protein, human)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 9)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptors)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)']",IM,"['Adjuvants, Immunologic/pharmacology', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived', 'Antigens, CD20/biosynthesis/immunology', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides/*pharmacology', 'Plasmacytoma/drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/genetics', 'Rituximab', 'Time Factors', 'Toll-Like Receptor 9', 'Toll-Like Receptors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2005/03/05 09:00,2005/07/29 09:00,['2005/03/05 09:00'],"['2005/03/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/29 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['11/4/1490 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-04-1890 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2005 Feb 15;11(4):1490-9. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-04-1890.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, approximately 50% of newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) have a normal karyotype. There has therefore been much interest in identifying molecular markers that could help to improve the prognostic stratification of patients with normal-karyotype AML. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Consecutive untreated AML patients (n = 67) from a single institution all with normal karyotype were analyzed for the presence of mutations in the myeloid transcription factor gene CEBPA (for CCAAT/enhancer binding protein-alpha), for internal tandem duplications (ITD) of the tyrosine kinase receptor gene FLT3 (for fms-like tyrosine kinase 3), and for expression of the BAALC gene (for brain and acute leukemia, cytoplasmic). RESULTS: 17.9% of normal-karyotype AML had mutations in the CEBPA gene, and 28.4% had FLT3-ITD; 65.7% (44 of 67) had high BAALC expression and 34.3% (23 of 67) had low BAALC expression. Patients with CEBPA mutations had a very favorable course of their disease. Median disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were 33.5 and 45.5 months, respectively, compared with 10 (e.g., 12 months in patients without CEBPA mutations; P = 0.0017; P = 0.0007). AML patients with FLT3-ITD had significantly shorter median DFS (P = 0.0328) and OS (P = 0.0148) than patients without FLT3-ITD. High BAALC expression predicted for a shorter DFS (P = 0.0152) and OS (P = 0.0210) compared with AML with low BAALC expression; 53.7% of normal-karyotype AML had neither FLT3-ITD nor CEBPA mutations. We found that high BAALC expression in normal-karyotype AML with neither FLT3-ITD nor CEBPA mutations (18 of 67) indicates adverse prognosis for both DFS and OS (P = 0.0001; e.g., P = 0.0001) compared with the group with low BAALC expression and absent FLT3-ITD and CEBPA mutations (18 of 67). Thus, BAALC expression represents a novel prognostic marker particularly for normal-karyotype AML patients with neither FLT3-ITD nor CEBPA mutations. CONCLUSIONS: Assessment of CEBPA mutations, FLT3-ITD, and BAALC expression permits to split normal-karyotype AML into clinically distinct subgroups.","['Bienz, Marianne', 'Ludwig, Madleina', 'Leibundgut, Elisabeth Oppliger', 'Mueller, Beatrice U', 'Ratschiller, Daniel', 'Solenthaler, Max', 'Fey, Martin F', 'Pabst, Thomas']","['Bienz M', 'Ludwig M', 'Leibundgut EO', 'Mueller BU', 'Ratschiller D', 'Solenthaler M', 'Fey MF', 'Pabst T']","['Institute of Medical Oncology and the Laboratory for Molecular Diagnostics, Department of Hematology, University of Berne, CH-3010 Berne, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (BAALC protein, human)', '0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha/genetics', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/immunology/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/genetics', 'Risk Assessment/methods', 'Survival Analysis', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3']",2005/03/05 09:00,2005/07/29 09:00,['2005/03/05 09:00'],"['2005/03/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/29 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['11/4/1416 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-04-1552 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2005 Feb 15;11(4):1416-24. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-04-1552.,,,,,,['Clin Cancer Res. 2005 Aug 1;11(15):5659'],,,,,,,,,,,

Mutation of the CEBPA may play an important role in leukemogenesis and prognosis. We sought to characterize the CEBPA mutation in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and to clarify if there is a distinct immunophenotype for leukemic cells with the mutation. EXPERIMENT DESIGN: One hundred and four patients with de novo AML were evaluated for the CEBPA mutation and immunophenotype of the leukemic cells. RESULTS: Twenty-two distinct mutations were identified in 16 (15%) of 104 AML patients. Fourteen patients had biallelic mutations, mostly involving both the NH(2)-terminal TAD1 region and the COOH-terminal basic leucine zipper domain (bZIP). The mutations in the bZIP region were always tandem duplications and were located at hot-spot regions for topoisomerase II sites. Sequential study of the CEBPA mutations showed that the mutations disappeared at complete remission but the same mutations reappeared at relapse. None of the patients developed novel mutations during the follow-up period. Patients with CEBPA mutations had significantly higher incidences of CD7 (73%), CD15 (100%), CD34 (93%), and HLA-DR (93%) expression on the leukemic cells. CONCLUSION: These data revealed that most AML with CEBPA mutations were associated with an immunophenotype of HLA-DR(+)CD7(+)CD13(+)CD14(-)CD15(+)CD33(+)CD34(+). The close relationship of CEBPA mutations with the leukemia status of the patients and the concordance of mutation in presenting and relapse samples implicate the CEBPA mutation as a potential marker for monitoring minimal residue disease.","['Lin, Liang-In', 'Chen, Chien-Yuan', 'Lin, Dong-Tsamn', 'Tsay, Woei', 'Tang, Jih-Luh', 'Yeh, You-Chia', 'Shen, Hwei-Ling', 'Su, Fang-Hsien', 'Yao, Ming', 'Huang, Sheng-Yi', 'Tien, Hwei-Fang']","['Lin LI', 'Chen CY', 'Lin DT', 'Tsay W', 'Tang JL', 'Yeh YC', 'Shen HL', 'Su FH', 'Yao M', 'Huang SY', 'Tien HF']","['Graduate Institute of Medical Technology, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan,']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Alleles', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Base Sequence', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha/*genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Female', 'Gene Duplication', 'HLA-DR Antigens/analysis', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/genetics', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3']",2005/03/05 09:00,2005/07/29 09:00,['2005/03/05 09:00'],"['2005/03/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/29 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['11/4/1372 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-04-1816 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2005 Feb 15;11(4):1372-9. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-04-1816.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Both patients were successfully treated with early surgical intervention for resection of all necrotizing enteric lesions, and subsequent aggressive critical care support.

Such organ fragments, which we termed micro-organs (MOs), express in culture endogenous tissue-specific gene products. We have exploited this methodology to engineer MOs ex vivo by gene transfer. METHODS: MOs prepared from spleen, lung, colon and skin were infected using: herpes simplex type-1, adeno virus, vaccinia virus and murine leukemia virus (MuLV), carrying the reporter gene beta-galactosidase. RESULTS: All four viral vectors infected MOs in culture, with adeno infection giving significantly higher values. After optimization, high levels of expression (> 15% positive cells), comparable to those obtained with the adeno construct, were also obtained using the MuLV construct both in vitro and after implantation into syngeneic hosts. After implantation, the engineered tissue was found to remain localized, become vascularized, and to express the transduced gene for several months. CONCLUSIONS: The system can be used to study interactions between viruses and tissues both ex vivo and in vivo. Furthermore, the approach proposes a novel platform for ex vivo gene therapy. Such engineered structures could be used as autologous biological pumps for continuous secretion in vivo of gene products of clinical importance.","['Hasson, E', 'Slovatizky, Y', 'Shimoni, Y', 'Falk, H', 'Panet, A', 'Mitrani, E']","['Hasson E', 'Slovatizky Y', 'Shimoni Y', 'Falk H', 'Panet A', 'Mitrani E']","['Institute of Life Sciences, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Jerusalem 91904, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,J Gene Med,The journal of gene medicine,9815764,['EC 3.2.1.23 (beta-Galactosidase)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Colon', 'Dependovirus/genetics', 'Female', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Genetic Therapy', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Herpesvirus 1, Human/genetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics', 'Lung', 'Male', 'Mice', '*Organ Culture Techniques', 'Skin', 'Spleen', 'Tissue Distribution', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Vaccinia virus/genetics', 'beta-Galactosidase/analysis']",2005/03/04 09:00,2005/09/17 09:00,['2005/03/04 09:00'],"['2005/03/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/17 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/04 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jgm.740 [doi]'],ppublish,J Gene Med. 2005 Jul;7(7):926-35. doi: 10.1002/jgm.740.,,,,,,,,,"['Copyright 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']",,,,,,,,

Although therapeutical advances have been achieved, some ALL subgroups still fare poorly. CD1d is a monomorphic molecule that provides a suitable target for immunotherapy in view of the characterization of a glycolipid, alpha-galactosylceramide (alpha-GalCer), capable of being presented to CD1d-restricted T cells with cytotoxic potential. We investigated CD1d expression in 80 pediatric B-cell precursor (BCP) ALL cases defined according to immunophenotype, cytogenetic features and age at onset. CD1d was detected on ALL cells in 15% of the patients. CD1d+ ALLs were significantly associated with infant leukemia, pro-B phenotype and mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL)/AF4 gene rearrangement. Accordingly, overall survival of patients with CD1d+ ALL was significantly shorter. CD1d+ leukemic blasts were able to present alpha-GalCer via CD1d to cytotoxic CD1d-restricted T cells, which induced apoptosis of ALL cells that was inhibited by mAb to CD1d.

Depsipeptides are present in certain bacteria and display potent antitumor activity. We have studied the effect of the novel cyclodepsipeptide AT514 (serratamolide) from Serratia marcescens on B-CLL cell viability. AT514 induced apoptosis of B-CLL cells from the 21 patients studied, as confirmed by Annexin-V binding and nuclei condensation, with an average IC50 of 13 microM. AT514 was effective in those B-CLL cases resistant to fludarabine, but had no effect on normal PBL. AT514 preferentially activated the intrinsic apoptotic pathway, as evidenced by loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, release of cytochrome c and activation of caspase-9 and -3, but not of caspase-8. Importantly, AT514 interfered with phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase and protein kinase C survival signals since it increased the apoptotic effect of LY294002 and Bisl inhibitors, and induced Akt dephosphorylation at Ser 473. AT514 also decreased NF-kappaB activity by dramatically reducing the levels of p65 in B-CLL. This was confirmed on functional assays using NF-kappaB-luc-transfected Raji cells and transgenic mice. Our results establish that AT514 induces apoptosis of primary B-CLL cells and could be useful for clinical treatment of this malignancy.","['Escobar-Diaz, E', 'Lopez-Martin, E M', 'Hernandez del Cerro, M', 'Puig-Kroger, A', 'Soto-Cerrato, V', 'Montaner, B', 'Giralt, E', 'Garcia-Marco, J A', 'Perez-Tomas, R', 'Garcia-Pardo, A']","['Escobar-Diaz E', 'Lopez-Martin EM', 'Hernandez del Cerro M', 'Puig-Kroger A', 'Soto-Cerrato V', 'Montaner B', 'Giralt E', 'Garcia-Marco JA', 'Perez-Tomas R', 'Garcia-Pardo A']","['Departamento de Inmunologia, Centro de Investigaciones Biologicas, CSIC, Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Depsipeptides)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Peptides, Cyclic)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '5285-25-6 (serratamolide)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (AKT1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Casp3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Casp9 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspase 9', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'Depsipeptides/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Luciferases/genetics', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Mitochondria/physiology', 'NF-kappa B/genetics/*metabolism', 'Peptides, Cyclic/*pharmacology', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Serratia marcescens/*chemistry', 'Transfection', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein']",2005/03/04 09:00,2005/05/27 09:00,['2005/03/04 09:00'],"['2005/03/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/05/27 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['2403679 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2403679 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2005 Apr;19(4):572-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403679.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several groups, including ours, have reported encouraging results of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) for patients with ATLL. To confirm our previous report and to establish the basis for a phase II clinical study, we analyzed 40 allo-HSCT for acute and lymphoma types of ATLL in seven institutions in Japan between 1997 and 2002. All evaluable cases entered complete remission (CR) after allo-HSCT and the median survival time was 9.6 months for all patients. The estimated 3-year overall and relapse-free survival, and disease relapse were 45.3, 33.8 and 39.3%, respectively. Among 10 cases with ATLL relapse, five cases achieved CR again: three by the reduction or cessation of immunosuppressive agents, which suggested a graft-versus-ATLL (GvATLL) effect. However, univariate or multivariate analysis did not show any benefit of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) on the prevention of relapse. These results suggested that allo-HSCT was effective for some patients with aggressive ATLL, and that the GvATLL effect could be achieved even without GVHD. A new phase II trial to test the efficacy of allo-HSCT for ATLL is warranted.","['Fukushima, T', 'Miyazaki, Y', 'Honda, S', 'Kawano, F', 'Moriuchi, Y', 'Masuda, M', 'Tanosaki, R', 'Utsunomiya, A', 'Uike, N', 'Yoshida, S', 'Okamura, J', 'Tomonaga, M']","['Fukushima T', 'Miyazaki Y', 'Honda S', 'Kawano F', 'Moriuchi Y', 'Masuda M', 'Tanosaki R', 'Utsunomiya A', 'Uike N', 'Yoshida S', 'Okamura J', 'Tomonaga M']","['Department of Hematology, Molecular Medicine Unit, Atomic Bomb Disease Institute, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Adult', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology/therapy', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Japan/epidemiology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Time Factors', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2005/03/04 09:00,2005/06/11 09:00,['2005/03/04 09:00'],"['2005/03/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/11 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['2403682 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2403682 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2005 May;19(5):829-34. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403682.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At diagnosis, the mean BCR-ABL/GUS ratio was 1.55 +/- 1.78. A total of 42 patients evaluable for outcome analysis were operationally divided into two MRD groups: good molecular responders (GMRs; n = 28) with > 2 log reduction of residual disease after induction and > 3 log reduction after consolidation therapy, and poor molecular responders (PMRs; n = 14) who, despite complete hematological remission, had a higher MRD at both time points.

We found that the t(1;19) in TS-2 fuses the 19p13 gene DAZAP1 (Deleted in Azoospermia-Associated Protein 1) to the 1q23 gene MEF2D (Myocyte Enhancer Factor 2D), leading to expression of reciprocal in-frame DAZAP1/MEF2D and MEF2D/DAZAP1 transcripts. MEF2D is a member of the MEF2 family of DNA binding proteins that activate transcription of genes involved in control of muscle cell differentiation, and signaling pathways that mediate response to mitogenic signals and survival of neurons and T-lymphocytes. DAZAP1 is a novel RNA binding protein expressed most abundantly in the testis. We demonstrate that MEF2D/DAZAP1 binds avidly and specifically to DNA in a manner indistinguishable from that of native MEF2D and is a substantially more potent transcriptional activator than MEF2D. We also show that DAZAP1/MEF2D is a sequence-specific RNA-binding protein. MEF2D has been identified as a candidate oncogene in murine retroviral insertional mutagenesis studies.

However, to successfully use microarrays for this purpose, the quality and reproducibility of the procedure need to be guaranteed. The quality of microarray analyses may be severely reduced, if variable frequencies of nontarget cells are present in the starting material. To systematically investigate the influence of different types of impurity, we determined gene expression profiles of leukemic samples containing different percentages of nonleukemic leukocytes. Furthermore, we used computer simulations to study the effect of different kinds of impurity as an alternative to conducting hundreds of microarray experiments on samples with various levels of purity. As expected, the percentage of erroneously identified genes rose with the increase of contaminating nontarget cells in the samples. The simulations demonstrated that a tumor load of less than 75% can lead to up to 25% erroneously identified genes. A tumor load of at least 90% leads to identification of at most 5% false-positive genes.

We evaluated the FTI manumycin A (manumycin) in two myeloid leukemia cell lines (U937 and HL-60). Manumycin induced nitric oxide production and apoptosis of the leukemia cells. Nitric oxide or other reactive oxygen species may induce oxidative DNA damage, and the number of apurinic sites increased after manumycin treatment, which was reversed by concurrent treatment with N-acetyl-L-cysteine. Since repair of DNA damage is important to cell survival, we hypothesized that methoxyamine, an inhibitor of base-excision repair, would enhance the antineoplastic effect of manumycin. The combination of manumycin and methoxyamine resulted in enhanced apoptosis by six criteria increased annexin V binding, release of mitochondrial cytochrome c into the cytosol, activation of caspase-9, activation of caspase-3, specific cleavage of poly-adenosyl ribose polymerase, and increase in the sub-G1 cell cycle fraction. The drug combination enhanced inhibition on the soft agar clonogenic assay and on the formazan dye cell viability assay. The effects of manumycin or manumycin plus methoxyamine on apoptosis were blocked by N-acetyl-L-cysteine, and partially by nitric oxide synthase inhibitors or scavenger of peroxide. We conclude that methoxyamine enhances manumycin-induced apoptosis in myeloid leukemia cells.","['She, M', 'Pan, I', 'Sun, L', 'Yeung, S C Jim']","['She M', 'Pan I', 'Sun L', 'Yeung SC']","['Department of General Internal Medicine, Ambulatory Treatment and Emergency Care, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Hydroxylamines)', '0 (Polyenes)', '0 (Polyunsaturated Alkamides)', '31C4KY9ESH (Nitric Oxide)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', '9TZH4WY30J (methoxyamine)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'OIQ298X4XD (manumycin)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspase 9', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'Cytosol/metabolism', 'DNA, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Hydroxylamines/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy/pathology', 'Mitochondria/metabolism', 'Nitric Oxide/metabolism', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Polyenes/*pharmacology', 'Polyunsaturated Alkamides', 'U937 Cells']",2005/03/04 09:00,2005/05/27 09:00,['2005/03/04 09:00'],"['2005/03/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/05/27 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['2403691 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2403691 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2005 Apr;19(4):595-602. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403691.,,,,['CA16672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Overall, 213 (47%) cases had ACA but the incidence varied according to patient age and 11q23 subgroup. Infants and patients with t(4;11)(q21;q23) had the lowest incidence of ACA (50/182 (27%) and 57/216 (26%) respectively), whereas patients with del(11)(q23) had the highest incidence (66/93 (71%)). Del(11)(q23) abnormalities were heterogeneous and occasionally secondary to t(9;22)(q34;q11.2). Thus, patients with del(11)(q23) comprised a separate biological entity, which was clearly distinct from those with an 11q23 translocation. The most frequent specific ACA were trisomy X (n = 38), abnormal 12p (n = 32), abnormal 9p (n = 28) and del(6q) (n = 19). The presence of ACA did not change the 5 year event-free survival estimates among children (56% (95% Cl 46-65%) vs 62% (54-69%)) or infants (22% (15-29%) vs 18% (9-29%)), nor when the different 11q23 subgroups were analyzed separately.

Though the resulting chimeric proteins directly participate in the development of leukemia, the long latency and monoclonal nature of the disease support the requirement for secondary mutation(s), such as those leading to overexpression of Meis1. Models to identify such events and to study leukemic progression are rare and labor intensive. Herein, we took advantage of the strong transforming potential of NUP98-HOXD13 or NUP98-HOXA10 to establish preleukemic myeloid lines from bone marrow cells that faithfully replicate the first step of Hox-induced leukemogenesis. These lines contain early granulomonocytic progenitors with extensive in vitro self-renewal capacity, short-term myeloid repopulating activity and low propensity for spontaneous leukemic conversion. We exploit such lines to show that Meis1 efficiently induces their leukemic progression and demonstrate a high frequency of preleukemic cells in the cultures. Furthermore, we document that the leukemogenic potential of Meis1 is independent of its direct binding to DNA and likely reflects its ability to increase the repopulating capacity of the preleukemic cells by increasing their self-renewal/proliferative capacity. The availability of lines with repopulating potential and capacity for leukemic conversion should open new avenues for understanding progression of Hox-mediated acute myeloid leukemia.","['Pineault, N', 'Abramovich, C', 'Humphries, R K']","['Pineault N', 'Abramovich C', 'Humphries RK']","['Terry Fox Laboratory, British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (MEIS1 protein, human)', '0 (Meis1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein)', '0 (NUP98-HOXC13 fusion protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (VSX2 protein, human)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology/physiology', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/methods', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/*physiopathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein', 'Myeloid Progenitor Cells/cytology/physiology/*transplantation', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'Transcription Factors']",2005/03/04 09:00,2005/05/27 09:00,['2005/03/04 09:00'],"['2005/03/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/05/27 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['2403696 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2403696 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2005 Apr;19(4):636-43. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403696.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we report the identification of two ATRA responsive genes in APL cells, ID1 and ID2. These proteins act as antagonists of basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors. ATRA induced a rapid increase in ID1 and ID2, both in the APL cell line NB4 as well as in primary patient cells. In addition, a strong downregulation of E2A was observed. E2A acts as a general heterodimerization partner for many bHLH proteins that are involved in differentiation control in various tissues. The simultaneous upregulation of ID1 and ID2, and the downregulation of E2A suggest a role for bHLH proteins in the induction of differentiation of APL cells following ATRA treatment. To test the relevance of this upregulation, ID1 and ID2 were overexpressed in NB4 cells. Overexpression inhibited proliferation and induced a G0/G1 accumulation. These results indicate that ID1 and ID2 are important retinoic acid responsive genes in APL, and suggest that the inhibition of specific bHLH transcription factor complexes may play a role in the therapeutic effect of ATRA in APL.","['Nigten, J', 'Breems-de Ridder, M C', 'Erpelinck-Verschueren, C A J', 'Nikoloski, G', 'van der Reijden, B A', 'van Wageningen, S', 'van Hennik, P B', 'de Witte, T', 'Lowenberg, B', 'Jansen, J H']","['Nigten J', 'Breems-de Ridder MC', 'Erpelinck-Verschueren CA', 'Nikoloski G', 'van der Reijden BA', 'van Wageningen S', 'van Hennik PB', 'de Witte T', 'Lowenberg B', 'Jansen JH']","['Central Hematology Laboratory and Department of Hematology, Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (ID1 protein, human)', '0 (ID2 protein, human)', '0 (Inhibitor of Differentiation Protein 1)', '0 (Inhibitor of Differentiation Protein 2)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (TCF3 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Clone Cells/drug effects', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', '*DNA-Binding Proteins/drug effects/genetics/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'G1 Phase/*drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Differentiation Protein 1', 'Inhibitor of Differentiation Protein 2', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', '*Repressor Proteins/drug effects/genetics/pharmacology', 'Resting Phase, Cell Cycle/*drug effects', '*Transcription Factors/drug effects/genetics/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology']",2005/03/04 09:00,2005/06/11 09:00,['2005/03/04 09:00'],"['2005/03/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/11 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['2403699 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2403699 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2005 May;19(5):799-805. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403699.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The overall pattern of B cell signaling molecules in this disease is therefore closer to that of diffuse large B cell lymphoma than to Hodgkin's disease, and is consistent with a common cell of origin as an explanation of the similar gene expression profiles.","['Marafioti, T', 'Pozzobon, M', 'Hansmann, M-L', 'Gaulard, P', 'Barth, T F', 'Copie-Bergman, C', 'Roberton, H', 'Ventura, R', 'Martin-Subero, J I', 'Gascoyne, R D', 'Pileri, S A', 'Siebert, R', 'Hsi, E D', 'Natkunam, Y', 'Moller, P', 'Mason, D Y']","['Marafioti T', 'Pozzobon M', 'Hansmann ML', 'Gaulard P', 'Barth TF', 'Copie-Bergman C', 'Roberton H', 'Ventura R', 'Martin-Subero JI', 'Gascoyne RD', 'Pileri SA', 'Siebert R', 'Hsi ED', 'Natkunam Y', 'Moller P', 'Mason DY']","['Leukaemia Research Fund Immunodiagnostics Unit, Nuffield Department of Clinical Laboratory Sciences, University of Oxford, UK. teresa.marafioti@ndcls.ox.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (B cell linker protein)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Enzyme Precursors)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (NFATC Transcription Factors)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (SYK protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Syk Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (lyn protein-tyrosine kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.4.- (Type C Phospholipases)', 'EC 3.1.4.3 (Phospholipase C gamma)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Blotting, Western', 'Carrier Proteins/analysis/*biosynthesis', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/analysis/biosynthesis', 'Enzyme Precursors/analysis/*biosynthesis', 'Hodgkin Disease/*metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/chemistry/*metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/chemistry/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mediastinal Neoplasms/chemistry/*metabolism/pathology', 'NFATC Transcription Factors', 'Nuclear Proteins/analysis/biosynthesis', 'Phospholipase C gamma', 'Phosphoproteins/analysis/*biosynthesis', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/analysis/*biosynthesis', 'Signal Transduction', 'Syk Kinase', 'Transcription Factors/analysis/biosynthesis', 'Type C Phospholipases/analysis/*biosynthesis', 'src-Family Kinases/analysis/biosynthesis']",2005/03/04 09:00,2005/06/11 09:00,['2005/03/04 09:00'],"['2005/03/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/11 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['2403702 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2403702 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2005 May;19(5):856-61. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403702.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

During this process, the lytic granule membrane protein CD107a becomes detectable at the cell surface. Based on this phenomenon, we have analyzed by a novel flow cytometry-based assay, the number and phenotype of NK cells responding to tumor targets. Using human leukemia and lymphoma cell lines, we observed a close correlation between CD107a surface expression and target cell lysis, indicating that NK cell cytotoxicity can be assessed by this method. The number of degranulating NK cells was closely related to the ratio of effector and target cells and showed a maximum at a ratio of 1:1. Moreover, we were able to show that the population of CD56(dim)/CD16(neg) NK cells is primarily responsible for the cytotoxic activity against tumor targets whereas neither CD56(dim)/CD16(pos) nor CD56(bright) NK cells degranulated in response to the cell lines.

Within a cohort of 99 HIV-related NHLs, 10 cases were found to be KSHV positive on the basis of immunostaining for KSHV LNA-1 as well as KSHV-specific polymerase chain reaction. All but one of the tumors coexpressed Epstein-Barr virus. Interestingly, all KSHV-positive cases belonged to a distinctive subgroup of 26 diffuse large B-cell lymphomas characterized by the expression of CD138 (syndecan-1) and plasmablastic/immunoblastic morphology.

However, p53-/- mice rapidly develop a variety of neoplasms, while Gadd45a-/- mice do not. The two proteins are involved in a regulatory feedback loop, whereby each can increase the expression or activity of the other, suggesting that common phenotypes might result from similar molecular mechanisms. Mice lacking both genes were generated to address this issue. Gadd45a-/-p53-/- mice developed tumors with a latency similar to that of tumor-prone p53-/- mice. However, while p53-/- mice developed a variety of tumor types, nearly all Gadd45a-/-p53-/- mice developed lymphoblastic lymphoma (LBL), often accompanied by mediastinal masses as is common in human patients with this tumor type. Deletion of Gadd45a in leukemia/lymphoma-prone AKR mice decreased the latency for LBL. These results indicate that Gadd45a may act as modifier locus for T-cell LBL, whereby deletion of Gadd45a enhances development of this tumor type in susceptible mice.

We analyzed survival according to racial/ethnic categories for 3587 consecutive patients who had SCT at a single US institution between July 1992 and December 2000. Among 1366 patients who received autologous SCT, race or ethnicity was not significantly associated with survival. In contrast, among 2221 patients who received allogeneic SCT from HLA-matched unrelated or sibling donors, blacks had a significantly greater mortality than whites (unadjusted hazard ratio, 1.65; 95% confidence interval, 1.21-2.25). Mortality among other racial or ethnic groups was not significantly different from that among whites. The greater mortality hazard among blacks persisted after controlling for donor type, pretransplantation risk category, patient age, donor/patient sex, and cytomegalovirus exposure (hazard ratio, 1.71; 95% confidence interval, 1.25-2.34). SCT from both HLA-matched unrelated and HLA-identical sibling donors was associated with more severe acute graft-versus-host disease and higher nonrelapse mortality among blacks compared with whites. Furthermore, blacks who received SCT for chronic myeloid leukemia had longer diagnosis-to-transplantation intervals than whites. A matched-cohort analysis showed that the higher mortality among blacks could not be explained by obvious socioeconomic differences. The higher incidence of severe graft-versus-host disease among blacks compared with whites, both with HLA-identical sibling donors, might be related to yet-unidentified ""immune-enhancing"" genetic polymorphisms.

Antigen mismatches due to polymorphic differences between the patient and donor are central in the mechanisms of GVHD. Polymorphisms are known for FcgammaRIIa, and this molecule is present on endothelial, dendritic, and Langerhans cells. Donor cells reacting against the patient as GVHD can also react against the malignancy of the patient, and this is known as the graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect. Because the FcgammaRIIa molecule is also present on acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells, an FcgammaRIIa mismatch could be a target for both GVHD and GVL. We retrospectively studied 73 AML patients and analyzed the differences in GVHD and relapse incidence between patients with and without a pro-GVHD/GVL FcgammaRIIa allotype mismatch. We observed a difference in FcgammaRIIa receptors with a pro-GVHD/GVL mismatch in 18 patient/donor pairs (25%). Univariate and multivariate analyses demonstrated the pro-GVHD mismatch to be a significant risk factor for the development of acute GVHD. There was no effect on the occurrence of chronic GVHD. The relapse incidence was not significantly different for patients with or without the pro-GVL mismatch, although there was a trend for fewer relapses in standard-risk AML patients with the pro-GVL mismatch. We conclude that the polymorphism of the FcgammaRIIa receptor may be a candidate target for acute GVHD.","['van der Straaten, Hanneke M', 'Fijnheer, Rob', 'Nieuwenhuis, H Karel', 'van de Winkel, Jan G J', 'Verdonck, Leo F']","['van der Straaten HM', 'Fijnheer R', 'Nieuwenhuis HK', 'van de Winkel JG', 'Verdonck LF']","['Department of Haematology, University Medical Center Utrecht, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Fc gamma receptor IIA)', '0 (Receptors, IgG)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Antigens, CD/*genetics', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*genetics/immunology', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/genetics/immunology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/complications/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Receptors, IgG/*genetics', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Transplantation Immunology', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2005/03/04 09:00,2005/09/24 09:00,['2005/03/04 09:00'],"['2005/03/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/24 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['S108387910400984X [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbmt.2004.12.331 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2005 Mar;11(3):206-12. doi: 10.1016/j.bbmt.2004.12.331.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To investigate HMGB1/amphoterin effects on macrophages, U937 human monocytic leukemia cells and rat peritoneal and human alveolar macrophages were examined. U937 cells expressed low levels of an HMGB1/amphoterin receptor, receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE), whereas RAGE production was induced in differentiated phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-U937 cells. Treatment with cultured medium of HMGB1/amphoterin-secreting WiDr human colon cancer cells showed growth inhibition of both U937 and PMA-U937 cells and apoptosis in PMA-U937 cells. The number of PMA-U937 cells was markedly decreased by co-culture with WiDr cells exposed to HMGB1/amphoterin sense S-oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) in spheroids or monolayers. In contrast, PMA-U937 cells co-cultured with WiDr cells exposed to HMGB1/amphoterin anti-sense S-ODN were preserved in number. PMA-U937 cells exposed to RAGE anti-sense S-ODN were insensitive to WiDr-cultured medium. Recombinant human HMGB1/amphoterin induced growth inhibition in thioglycollate-induced rat peritoneal macrophages, PMA-U937 cells, and human alveolar macrophages, an effect that was abrogated by absorption with anti-HMGB1 antibody. Phosphorylation of JNK and Rac1 was induced in PMA-U937 cells treated with HMGB1/amphoterin. These results suggest that HMGB1/amphoterin induces growth inhibition and apoptosis in macrophages through RAGE intracellular signaling pathway.","['Kuniyasu, Hiroki', 'Yano, Seiji', 'Sasaki, Takamitsu', 'Sasahira, Tomonori', 'Sone, Sabro', 'Ohmori, Hitoshi']","['Kuniyasu H', 'Yano S', 'Sasaki T', 'Sasahira T', 'Sone S', 'Ohmori H']","['Department of Molecular Pathology, Nara Medical University, 840 Shijo-cho, Kashihara, Nara, 634-8521, Japan. cooninh@zb4.so-net.ne.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Am J Pathol,The American journal of pathology,0370502,"['0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (Glycation End Products, Advanced)', '0 (HMGB1 Protein)', '0 (Nitrites)', '0 (Oligonucleotides)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (NOS2 protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (Nitric Oxide Synthase)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (Nitric Oxide Synthase Type II)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (Nos2 protein, rat)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Colonic Neoplasms/*metabolism', 'Culture Media, Conditioned/pharmacology', 'Glycation End Products, Advanced/metabolism', 'HMGB1 Protein/*biosynthesis/chemistry', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System', 'Macrophages/cytology/*metabolism', 'Nitric Oxide Synthase/metabolism', 'Nitric Oxide Synthase Type II', 'Nitrites/metabolism', 'Oligonucleotides/chemistry', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/chemistry', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred F344', 'Recombinant Proteins/chemistry', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate', 'Time Factors', 'U937 Cells']",2005/03/04 09:00,2005/04/09 09:00,['2005/03/04 09:00'],"['2005/03/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/09 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0002-9440(10)62296-1 [pii]', '10.1016/S0002-9440(10)62296-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Pathol. 2005 Mar;166(3):751-60. doi: 10.1016/S0002-9440(10)62296-1.,,,,,PMC1602344,,,,,,,,,,,,

Neoplasms in bone marrow were composed of small round lymphocytes arranged in nodular (n = 6), diffuse (n = 5), interstitial (n = 5), or mixed (n = 10) patterns. All cases were positive for monotypic surface immunoglobulin light chain, IgM/IgD, CD5, CD19, CD20, and CD23.

There is striking frequent hypercalcemia with increased numbers of osteoclasts. Central to the identification of the disease is a striking geographic clustering in southwestern Japan and the isolation of human T-cell lymphotropic virus type-1 (HTLV-1) from the cell lines of patients. Worldwide epidemiological studies have been made through international collaborations. Several diseases were found to be related to HTLV-1 infection. Moreover, it was noted that an immunodeficiency state may be induced by HTLV-1 infection.

We report a patient with acute myeloid leukemia who had invasive pulmonary aspergillosis during induction therapy being treated with amphotericin B in first step and afterwards with caspofungin. The patient received consolidation therapy and allogeneic stem cell transplantation while using caspofungin, and did not experience any adverse effect related to drug. Many side effects, e.g. derangements in liver and kidney functions, hypokalemia, infusion-related side effects and especially thrombocytopenia, which are common with amphotericin B treatment are no longer problem with caspofungin. The efficacy of caspofungin in terms of regression of pulmonary lesions and control of fever is quite successful.

The approach uses heavy-tailed priors to promote sparsity in the utilization of both basis functions and features; these priors act as regularizers for the likelihood function that rewards good classification on the training data. We derive an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm to efficiently compute a maximum a posteriori (MAP) point estimate of the various parameters. The algorithm is an extension of recent state-of-the-art sparse Bayesian classifiers, which in turn can be seen as Bayesian counterparts of support vector machines.

Because the karyotype identified at diagnosis is the most relevant prognostic factor for AML, it should be possible to assess the efficacy more accurately on the basis of cytogenetic risk. METHODS: The authors performed a metaanalysis of five studies, which employed both natural randomization based on donor availability and intention-to-treat analysis, with overall survival as an outcome of interest. Metaregression analysis was then performed to identify the efficacy for patients stratified into the favorable, intermediate, and poor cytogenetic risk groups. RESULTS: For the entire cohort, there was a statistically significant advantage with allo-HSCT in terms of overall survival with a summary hazard ratio of 1.15 (95% confidence interval, 1.01-1.32, P = 0.037) for the random-effect model. Metaregression analysis showed a significant coefficient of +0.24 for the poor cytogenetic risk group, and -0.25 for the favorable cytogenetic risk group, indicating that the benefit of allo-HSCT was further increased for the former, and lost for the latter. The coefficient for the intermediate cytogenetic risk group was +0.09, and was not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggested that the efficacy of allo-HSCT for patients with AML in CR1 depended on cytogenetic risk. The beneficial effect of allo-HSCT was yielded for the poor risk group, and probably for the intermediate risk groups, but was absent for the favorable risk group.","['Yanada, Masamitsu', 'Matsuo, Keitaro', 'Emi, Nobuhiko', 'Naoe, Tomoki']","['Yanada M', 'Matsuo K', 'Emi N', 'Naoe T']","['Department of Hematology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan. myanada@med.nagoya-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,['0 (HLA Antigens)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'HLA Antigens/metabolism', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/mortality/pathology/*therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Rate', 'Tissue Donors', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",2005/03/03 09:00,2005/05/27 09:00,['2005/03/03 09:00'],"['2005/03/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/05/27 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/03 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.20945 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2005 Apr 15;103(8):1652-8. doi: 10.1002/cncr.20945.,,,,,,,,,['(c) 2005 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,,,

However, it was observed that Asian MDS patients were younger than subjects in Western reports. With this in mind, the study was conducted prospectively on 52 Indian patients to define chromosomal abnormalities and to understand ethno-geographical differences, if any, underlying the pathogenesis of MDS among this Asian population. Cytogenetic analysis was performed using GTG banding and karyotyped according to the International System for Human Cytogenetic Nomenclature (ISCN). The incidence of MDS was predominant in the age group of 41-60 years (44.23%), with a median age at diagnosis of 55 years. The disease was more frequent in males (33 patients, 63.46%) than females (19 patients, 36.53%). Of 48 patients successfully karyotyped, 17 had normal karyotype (35.4%) and 31 patients (64.5%) had a chromosomal abnormality. The most frequent chromosome abnormalities were del 5q/-5 in 13 patients (42%), -7/7q- in 10 patients (32.2%), +8 and del 20q- in 6 cases each (19.3%) and i(17)(q10) in 1 patient (3.2%). In addition to these non-random chromosomal abnormalities, some rare abnormalities were also encountered. A higher rate of transformation to acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) was observed in the Chinese population compared to other Asian countries. The incidence of chromosomal abnormalities varied considerably across the different Asian populations. The overall frequency of chromosomal abnormalities in our study was comparable to most Western reports. Further prospective studies are warranted to elucidate precisely the ethnic differences in the pathogenesis of MDS in the Indian population.","['Dakshinamurthy, Amirtha Ganesh', 'Novitzky, Nicolas', 'Bharadwaj, Raghva', 'Prakhya, Balakrishna Murthy']","['Dakshinamurthy AG', 'Novitzky N', 'Bharadwaj R', 'Prakhya BM']","['Department of Haematology, Groote Schuur Hospital and the University of Cape Town Leukemia Center, Observatory, Cape Town 7925, South Africa. dakshina@cormack.uct.ac.za']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20050302,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', '*Asians', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosomes, Human/genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'India/epidemiology', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/diagnosis/*ethnology/genetics', 'Prevalence']",2005/03/03 09:00,2005/08/12 09:00,['2005/03/03 09:00'],"['2004/09/28 00:00 [received]', '2004/12/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/03/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/12 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/03 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00277-004-0997-x [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2005 May;84(5):298-303. doi: 10.1007/s00277-004-0997-x.

OBJECTIVE: To compare the benefits and toxic effects of adjuvant chemotherapy among breast cancer patients in age groups of 50 years or younger, 51 to 64 years, and 65 years or older. DESIGN AND SETTING: Retrospective review of data from 4 randomized trials that accrued patients from academic and community medical centers between 1975 and 1999. Median follow-up for all patients was 9.6 years. All trials randomized patients to different regimens, doses, schedules, and durations of chemotherapy and all had a treatment arm with doses or schedules that were regarded to be ""high"" and potentially more toxic. PATIENTS: A total of 6487 women with lymph node-positive breast cancer; 542 (8%) patients were 65 years or older and 159 (2%) were 70 years or older. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Comparison of disease-free survival, overall survival, and treatment-related mortality among different age groups. RESULTS: Multivariate analysis showed that smaller tumor size, fewer positive lymph nodes, more chemotherapy, and tamoxifen use were all significantly (P<.001) related to longer disease-free and overall survival. There was no association between age and disease-free survival. Overall survival was significantly (P<.001) worse for patients aged 65 or older because of death from causes other than breast cancer. Thirty-three deaths (0.5% of all patients) were attributed to treatment, and older women had higher treatment-related mortality. Older women and younger women derived similar reductions in breast cancer mortality and recurrence from regimens containing more chemotherapy. CONCLUSION: Age alone should not be a contraindication to the use of optimal chemotherapy regimens in older women who are in good general health.","['Muss, Hyman B', 'Woolf, Susan', 'Berry, Donald', 'Cirrincione, Constance', 'Weiss, Raymond B', 'Budman, Daniel', 'Wood, William C', 'Henderson, I Craig', 'Hudis, Clifford', 'Winer, Eric', 'Cohen, Harvey', 'Wheeler, Judith', 'Norton, Larry']","['Muss HB', 'Woolf S', 'Berry D', 'Cirrincione C', 'Weiss RB', 'Budman D', 'Wood WC', 'Henderson IC', 'Hudis C', 'Winer E', 'Cohen H', 'Wheeler J', 'Norton L']","['Fletcher Allen Health Care, Vermont Cancer Center, Burlington, VT 05401, USA. hyman.muss@uvm.edu']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,JAMA,JAMA,7501160,,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Breast Neoplasms/*drug therapy', '*Chemotherapy, Adjuvant', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lymphatic Metastasis', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Assessment', 'Survival Analysis']",2005/03/03 09:00,2005/03/05 09:00,['2005/03/03 09:00'],"['2005/03/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/05 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['293/9/1073 [pii]', '10.1001/jama.293.9.1073 [doi]']",ppublish,JAMA. 2005 Mar 2;293(9):1073-81. doi: 10.1001/jama.293.9.1073.,,,,"['CA02599/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA03927/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA04326/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA04457/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA07968/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA08025/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA11028/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA11789/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA12011/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA12046/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA12449/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA16450/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA21060/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA21115/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA25224/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA26806/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA31809/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA31946/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA31983/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA32102/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA32291/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA33601/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA35091/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA35279/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA35421/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA37135/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA41287/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA45374/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA45389/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA45418/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA45564/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA45808/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA47515/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA47545/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA47555/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA47559/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA47577/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA47642/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA52784/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA54697/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA60138/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA60247/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA71323/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA74811/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA77298/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA77406/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA77440/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA77597/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA77651/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,['JAMA. 2005 Mar 2;293(9):1118-20.

Sphingosine kinase 1 (SphK1) and formation of S1P, which leads to transactivation of S1P receptors and their downstream signaling pathways, regulates mast-cell functions initiated by cross-linking of the high-affinity immunoglobulin E (IgE) receptor FcepsilonRI. Surprisingly, overexpression of SphK1 in rat basophilic leukemia (RBL)-2H3 mast cells impaired degranulation as well as migration toward antigen. These effects were reversed by serum withdrawal, yet the increased formation and secretion of S1P were the same as in the presence of serum. Nonetheless, serum increased localization of SphK1 at the plasma membrane. This restricted formation of S1P induced internalization and desensitization of S1P receptors on the surface of mast cells as determined by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy, aberrant S1P receptor signaling, and lack of S1P receptor coupling to G proteins. Serum starvation, which significantly reduced membrane-associated SphK1 activity, restored S1P receptor functions.

Both wild-type and mutant transcripts were expressed in affected individuals by allele-specific reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Thrombopoietin (TPO) binds to the Mpl receptor and is the major regulator of megakaryopoiesis. To explore the mechanisms underlying thrombocytopenia, we studied the TPO/Mpl pathway in this newly identified pedigree. TPO levels were mildly to moderately elevated. On flow cytometry and immunoblotting, Mpl receptor expression was decreased and TPO-induced signaling was impaired. While no mutations were identified in the MPL gene by sequence analysis, low MPL mRNA levels were found, suggesting decreased gene expression. Of particular interest, several AML1-binding motifs are present in the MPL promoter, suggesting MPL is an AML1 target.

The process of A-MuLV infection requires cleavage of the R peptide from the envelope protein. This occurs within virions thereby rendering them competent to fuse with target cells. Envelope proteins lacking the inhibitory R peptide (e.g. envelope (R-) proteins) induce viral envelope-mediated cell-cell fusion (syncytium). Here we have performed studies to determine if cell signaling through protein kinases is involved in the regulation of PiT2-mediated A-MuLV envelope (R-)-induced syncytium formation. Truncated A-MuLV retroviral envelope protein lacking the inhibitory R peptide (R-) was used to induce viral envelope-mediated cell-cell fusion. Signaling through cyclic AMP to activate PKA was found to inhibit envelope-induced cell-cell fusion, whereas treatment of cells with PKA inhibitors H89, KT5720, and PKA Catalpha siRNA all enhanced this cell fusion process. It was noted that activation of PKC, as well as overexpression of PKCepsilon, up-regulated A-MuLV envelope protein-induced cell-cell fusion, whereas exposure to PKC inhibitors and expression of a kinase-inactive dominant-negative mutant of PKCepsilon (K437R) inhibited syncytium formation. v-ras transformed NIH3T3 cells were highly susceptible to A-MuLV envelope-induced cell-cell fusion, whereas expression of a dominant-negative mutant of Ras (N17Ras) inhibited this cell fusion process. Importantly, activation of Raf-1 protein kinase also is required for A-MuLV envelope-induced syncytium formation.

This article reviews the adverse event profiles of these DMAs based on the pivotal phase III trials, and provides practical guidelines for managing adverse effects. In general, the most common adverse events associated with IFN beta therapy are flu-like symptoms, including fever, chills and myalgias, and headache. The flu-like symptoms typically resolve within 24 hours and may be mitigated by over-the-counter anti-inflammatory agents. Adverse events related to glatiramer acetate therapy include injection-site reactions and a systemic reaction consisting of flushing, chest tightness, palpitation, anxiety or dyspnoea. The systemic reaction is transient (30 seconds to 30 minutes) and self-limited. Mitoxantrone may cause nausea, vomiting, alopecia, amenorrhoea and myelosuppression; isolated cases of acute leukaemia and dose-related cardiotoxicity have been reported in the literature. Longer-term tolerability data on mitoxantrone as a treatment for multiple sclerosis are needed. It is important for physicians to counsel patients on DMA-related adverse effects, most of which are transient and of mild-to-moderate severity. Various strategies that can be employed to prevent or manage these adverse effects and lessen their impact on the patient are discussed.","['Galetta, Steven L', 'Markowitz, Clyde']","['Galetta SL', 'Markowitz C']","['Department of Neurology, University of Pennsylvania Hospital, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, USA. galetta@mail.med.upenn.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,New Zealand,CNS Drugs,CNS drugs,9431220,,IM,"['Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Drug Approval', 'Humans', 'Multiple Sclerosis/*drug therapy', 'United States', 'United States Food and Drug Administration']",2005/03/03 09:00,2005/04/30 09:00,['2005/03/03 09:00'],"['2005/03/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/30 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['1935 [pii]', '10.2165/00023210-200519030-00005 [doi]']",ppublish,CNS Drugs. 2005;19(3):239-52. doi: 10.2165/00023210-200519030-00005.,59,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ethyl acetate extracts from Colpomenia sinuosa (Cs-EA), Halimeda discoidae (Hd-EA), and Galaxaura oblongata (Go-EA) directly inhibited the growth of human hepatoma HuH-7 cells and leukemia U937 and HL-60 cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Specifically, these algae extracts induced apoptosis of U937 and HL-60 cells as evaluated by detection of hypodiploid cells using flow cytometry and observation of condensed and fragmented nuclei in algae extract-treated cells. Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), especially hydrogen peroxide and superoxide anion, were increased about 2-3-fold in U937 cells treated with Cs-EA for 3-5 h. Interestingly, antioxidant N-acetylcysteine effectively blocked Cs-EA-, Hd-EA-, and Go-EA-induced apoptosis, suggesting that ROS is a key mediator in the apoptotic signaling pathway.

Specifically, the authors suggest that it is time for a ""paradigm shift."" It is time to reject the ""local, regional, systemic hypothesis"" of cancer and replace it with a hypothesis more consistent with the clinical facts, specifically, that cancer exists in many different forms (i.e. localized disease arising from locally acting carcinogens, which can spread locally and should be treated locally, and cancer that arises as localized disease but evolves to more malignant invasive disease [the current model of metastasis]). The other forms of cancer are systemic disease, which is induced by systemic carcinogens, and cancer arising in multiple cells and multiple sites, giving rise to a picture described as metastatic cancer. The importance of this paradigm shift is that more attention would be focused on identifying systemically acting carcinogens as they relate to etiology and to molecular abnormalities in the neoplastic cells that might be targeted clinically. Recent advances in cancer treatment have demonstrated that molecules that target cancer cell molecular abnormalities (rather than tissue of origin, lymph node, or metastasis) such as bcr-abl or mutations in a cellular receptor such as c-kit or epidermal growth factor possess curative potential. In addition, more attention should be devoted to distinguishing between local tumors and systemic disease, using sophisticated molecular biologic techniques. Perhaps most important, there is a need to devise therapeutic strategies that would treat cancer as a systemic illness and hopefully have a substantial impact on overall cancer mortality.","['Freireich, Emil J', 'Kurzrock, Razelle', 'Estrov, Zeev']","['Freireich EJ', 'Kurzrock R', 'Estrov Z']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.

However, the mean MRP-1 values in MM were significantly lower than MAF-MDR-1 (1.85+/-3.8 versus 5.92+/-7.45, p=0.05), but we have found lower values in refractory conditions as expected from previous studies of acute myeloid leukemia. The immunophenotyping was helpful in detection of abnormal populations showing no correlation with the MDR. However, in this study we could not confirm high MDR activity despite of the failure of chemotherapy. The calcein assay seems to be useful for quantitative and sensitive measurement of the MDR proteins. The low activity of MDR- 1 and MRP-1 in MM need further clarification, indicating the involvement of different transport in the resistance mechanism.","['Jakab, K', 'Gopcsa, L', 'Adam, E', 'Domjan, G', 'Sarkadi, B', 'Paloczi, K']","['Jakab K', 'Gopcsa L', 'Adam E', 'Domjan G', 'Sarkadi B', 'Paloczi K']","['Institute of Hematology and Immunology, National Medical Centre, Budapest, Hungary. kjakab@ohvi.hu']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Slovakia,Neoplasma,Neoplasma,0377266,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*drug therapy/*genetics/immunology', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/*drug therapy/*genetics/immunology']",2005/03/02 09:00,2005/06/04 09:00,['2005/03/02 09:00'],"['2005/03/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/04 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/02 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Neoplasma. 2005;52(1):36-42.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML), the Bcr-Abl kinase inhibitor imatinib (STI571, Gleevec) induces impressive response rates. However, resistance occurs especially in advanced phase CML and Ph+ ALL, primarily as a consequence of point mutations within the Bcr-Abl kinase domain that prevent imatinib from binding. To overcome imatinib resistance, alternative Abl kinase inhibitors are finding their way into clinical trials. However, it is likely that resistance to second-generation compounds will occur as well. Therefore, it will be critical to determine specific resistance profiles for each particular compound. We recently developed a cell-based screening strategy that allows one to predict the pattern and relative abundance of Bcr-Abl resistance mutations emerging in the presence of imatinib or an alternative Abl-kinase inhibitor. Using this strategy, the findings in inhibitor resistant sublines reflect observations made in CML patients with imatinib resistance, including Bcr-Abl mutations, amplification of the Bcr-Abl gene, and overexpression of the Bcr-Abl protein. We here provide a detailed methodological description, and discuss the implications of this strategy for different clinically relevant oncogenic tyrosine kinases.","['von Bubnoff, Nikolas', 'Barwisch, Simone', 'Speicher, Michael R', 'Peschel, Christian', 'Duyster, Justus']","['von Bubnoff N', 'Barwisch S', 'Speicher MR', 'Peschel C', 'Duyster J']","['Department of Internal Medicine III, Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany. n.bubnoff@lrz.tum.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20050325,United States,Cell Cycle,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA, Complementary/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Genetic Techniques', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Mutagenesis', '*Mutation', 'Neoplasms/metabolism/therapy', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*chemistry/*genetics', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology']",2005/03/02 09:00,2006/05/06 09:00,['2005/03/02 09:00'],"['2005/03/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/06 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/02 09:00 [entrez]']","['1560 [pii]', '10.4161/cc.4.3.1560 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Cycle. 2005 Mar;4(3):400-6. doi: 10.4161/cc.4.3.1560.

Considering that malignancy and its treatment cans affect normal development in childhood. We analysed the correlations between serum leptin levels and body composition after anticancer treatment. We studied 33 survivors (24 boys and 9 girls) who before our study, have been treated for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) (n=23) and Hodgkin disease (n=10) after 7.15+/-3.5 years. Sixteen patients with ALL received cranial irradiation (12Gy). We measured body mass index (BM1) fat mass (FM) and lean body mass (LBM) using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA). We compared these results to the results obtained from reference values (SD score). Leptin levels were measured with the RIA method. RESULTS: 1. Mean leptin levels were higher in girls after puberty (10.93 ng/mL+/-8.9) than in boys (3.73 ng/mL+/-3. 7). In boys no differences were found in leptin levels between T2-4 and T5 stages. In girls the leptin values increased after puberty. Leptin SD score levels were higher in boys during (1.55 +/-1.0) and after puberty (1.46+/-0.75) and in girls - after puberty (1.19 +/-1.51). We did not find any influence of cranial irradiation (12Gy) or various methotrexate doses (5 g/m(2) vs. 19/m(2)) leptin values. 2. No difference in BMI SD score was found within the whole study group. 3. FM did not change ill boys during and after puberty, although FM SD score were higher during puberty (2.98 +/-4.8). In girls FM and FM SD score were higher after puberty. In boys and girls LBM augmented with pubertal development but LBM SD score in boys were lower after puberty (-1.67 +/-1.7) in comparison to puberty (0.2 +/-1.7). No differences were found between LBM SD score in girls during and after puberty. 4. We found a correlation between leptin levels and BMI (r=0.59 p=0.001) and FM (r=0.77 p=0.0001). 5. Relation of FM to LBM in boys remained unchanged, however in girls it increased within pubertal development. CONCLUSION: l. Anticancer treatment during childhood shows no influence on body mass index although the tendency to higher fat mass in pubertal boys and in post pubertal girls is observed. 2. Leptin values depend on fat mass and do not relate directly to the pubertal stage.","['Krawczyk-Rybak, Maryna', 'Muszynska-Roslan, Katarzyna', 'Konstantynowicz, Jerzy', 'Solarz, Elzbieta', 'Wolczynski, Slawomir', 'Protas, Piotr']","['Krawczyk-Rybak M', 'Muszynska-Roslan K', 'Konstantynowicz J', 'Solarz E', 'Wolczynski S', 'Protas P']","['Klinika Onkologii Pediatrycznej, Dziecieca Akademia Medyczna, Waszyngtona 17, 15-274 Bialystok, Poland. rybak@amb.edu.pl']",['pol'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,Poland,Med Wieku Rozwoj,Medycyna wieku rozwojowego,100928610,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Leptin)']",IM,"['Absorptiometry, Photon', '*Adipose Tissue/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Adolescent', 'Age Factors', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects', 'Body Composition/*drug effects/*radiation effects', 'Body Mass Index', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cranial Irradiation/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Hodgkin Disease/drug therapy/radiotherapy/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Leptin/*blood/deficiency', 'Male', 'Poland', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/radiotherapy/*therapy', '*Puberty', 'Reference Values', 'Sex Factors']",2005/03/02 09:00,2005/04/09 09:00,['2005/03/02 09:00'],"['2005/03/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/09 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/02 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Med Wieku Rozwoj. 2004 Apr-Jun;8(2 Pt 1):297-307.,,,"Wplyw leczenia przeciwnowotworowego na wartosci leptyny w surowicy, wskaznik masy ciala oraz zawartosc masy tluszczowej i beztluszczowej.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

THE AIM: of the study was an assessment of percentage, absolute number and immature reticulocyte fraction (IFR) by flow cytometry in children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) and comparing them with classical indexes of the erythrocyte line. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The examined group of 14 children from 2 to 16 years with ALL, on remission support treatment (New York II protocol). RESULTS: The group which was treated by thioguanine and cyclophosphamide showed reduction of reticulocytes from mean value 3,1+/-1:1,4 to 2,5+/-1,8. IFR reduction was not significant statistically. In the group treated with vincristine and methotrexate an average percentage of reticulocytes fell from 3.5+/-O.8 to l,5+/-0,4 and IFR did not change significantly. In children who were treated by daunorubicin and cytosine arabinoside an average percentage of reticulocytes reduced from 3.2+/-O,8 to value 2,1+/-1, 7. The immature reticulocyte fraction (IFR) reduced significantly from 22,0+/-6,0 to 12,0+/-8,0 (p<0,03).

The frequency of deletions of GSTM1. GSTT1 genes and transition A-G in GSTP1 gene were taken into consideration. THE AIM of this study was to investigate the role of GST genes polymorphisms as a genetic risk factor for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), and to study the relationship of these polymorphisms with clinical outcome in childhood leukaemias. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 86 children with newly diagnosed acute leukaemia (female: male ratio = 37:49. median age = 7.8 years) and 460 healthy controls were examined using the PCR and PCR-RFLP methods to identify polymorphisms within GSTM1, GSTT1 and GSTP1 genes. In the group of children with ALL. the frequency of relapses, deaths, clinical course, immunophenotype of blasts and the initial response to prednisone were also analyzed. RESULTS: the higher frequency of A-G transition in the GSTP1 gene was identified in the group of children with ALL in comparison to healthy controls (OR=3.13, 95%CI=1.4-7). We also found that the combination of GSTPl (Val/Val) and GSTM1 null genotypes further increased the risk of ALL (OR= 10.63, 95%CI=3.47 - 32.58; p =0.0001). No differences in the frequency of GSTM1 and GSTTI genes between both groups (OR=1; 95%CI=0,59-1,74 and OR=0, 71; 95%CI=0.45-1.13 respectively) were observed. Statistical analysis has not revealed any connections between polymorphisms within glutathione S-transferases genes and the frequency of relapses and death or poor initial response to prednisone. However, the biphenotypic immunophenotype or B-line blasts were the risk factors of relapse or death of progression in ALL (p=0.03). CONCLUSION: transition in exon 5 of GSTP1 gene (alone or combined with GSTM1 deletion) may be one of the molecular predictors of higher susceptibility to acute leukaemia in children. but not of the clinical course of this disease.","['Zubowska, Malgorzata', 'Zielinska, Elzbieta', 'Zmyslowska, Agnieszka', 'Bodalski, Jerzy']","['Zubowska M', 'Zielinska E', 'Zmyslowska A', 'Bodalski J']","['Klinika Chorob Dzieci, Instytut Pediatrii, Uniwersytet Medyczny, Sporna 36/50, 91-738 Lodz, Poland.']",['pol'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Poland,Med Wieku Rozwoj,Medycyna wieku rozwojowego,100928610,"['0 (Isoenzymes)', '5Z93L87A1R (Guanine)', 'EC 2.5.1.- (glutathione S-transferase T1)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (GSTP1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione S-Transferase pi)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (glutathione S-transferase M1)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",IM,"['Adenine', 'Adolescent', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Exons/genetics', 'Female', '*Gene Deletion', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Glutathione S-Transferase pi', 'Glutathione Transferase/blood/*genetics', 'Guanine', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Isoenzymes/blood/*genetics', 'Male', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/physiopathology', 'Risk Factors']",2005/03/02 09:00,2005/04/09 09:00,['2005/03/02 09:00'],"['2005/03/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/09 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/02 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Med Wieku Rozwoj. 2004 Apr-Jun;8(2 Pt 1):245-57.,,,Zwiekszona czestosc tranzycji A-G eksonu genu GSTP1 jako genetyczny cynnik ryzyka podatnosci na ostre bialaczki wieku dzieciecego.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Ninety-one previously treated patients with CLL (74 men and 17 women; median age, 58 years [range, 32 to 75 years]; 44 were refractory to purine analogs) received a median of 9 weeks of alemtuzumab treatment between 1996 and 2003. Regular bone marrow assessments by MRD flow cytometry were performed with the aim of eradicating detectable MRD (< 1 CLL cell in 10(5) normal cells). RESULTS: Responses according to National Cancer Institute-sponsored working group response criteria were complete remission (CR) in 32 patients (36%), partial remission (PR) in 17 patients (19%), and no response (NR) in 42 patients (46%). Twenty-two (50%) of 44 purine analog-refractory patients responded to alemtuzumab. Detectable CLL was eradicated from the blood and marrow in 18 patients (20%). Median survival was significantly longer in MRD-negative patients compared with those achieving an MRD-positive CR, PR, or NR. Patients achieving an MRD-negative CR had a longer treatment-free survival than patients with MRD-positive CRs, PR, or NR: MRD-negative CRs, not reached; MRD-positive CRs, 20 months; PRs, 13 months; NR, 6 months (P < .0001). Overall survival for the 18 patients with MRD-negative remissions was 84% at 60 months. Eight (47%) of the MRD-negative patients converted to MRD positivity at a median of 28 months.

Low concentrations of BMS-214662 efficiently inhibited protein farnesylation but did not affect the activation of Akt. BMS-214662 treatment increased levels of the BH3-only protein PUMA; induced proapoptotic conformational changes of Bax and Bak; reduced Mcl-1 levels; caused mitochondrial transmembrane potential loss; induced cytochrome c release, caspase activation, apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) nuclear translocation, and phosphatidylserine exposure; and allowed the development of apoptotic morphology. Western blot analysis of cell extracts revealed the activation of caspases 2, 3, 8, and 9 upon treatment with BMS-214662. The general caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk significantly prevented BMS-214662-induced death in U266 and RPMI 8226 cells but not in NCI-H929 cells. A mixture of selective caspase inhibitors for caspases 9 [N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Leu-Glu-His-Asp-fluoromethyl ketone (Z-LEHD-fmk)], 3 (Z-DEVD-fmk), and 6 (Z-VEID-fmk) approached the protective effect of Z-VAD upon cell death. However, Z-VAD-fmk did not prevent BMS-214662-induced Bax and Bak activation and decrease of Mcl-1 levels. According to its effect on cell death, Z-VAD-fmk inhibited nuclear translocation of AIF in RPMI 8226 and U266 but not in NCI-H929 cells. These results suggest that apoptosis triggered by BMS-214662 is initiated by a PUMA/Bax/Bak/Mcl-1-dependent mechanism. In some cell lines, Bax/Bak activation is not sufficient per se to induce mitochondrial failure and release of apoptogenic proteins, and so caspases need to be activated to facilitate apoptosis. After DeltaPsi(m) loss, execution of apoptosis was performed in all cases by a cytochrome c-enabled, caspase-9-triggered, caspase cascade and the nuclear action of AIF.","['Gomez-Benito, Maria', 'Marzo, Isabel', 'Anel, Alberto', 'Naval, Javier']","['Gomez-Benito M', 'Marzo I', 'Anel A', 'Naval J']","['Departamento de Bioquimica y Biologia Molecular y Celular, Facultad de Ciencias, Universidad de Zaragoza, 50009 Zaragoza, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20050228,United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BAK1 protein, human)', '0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (BBC3 protein, human)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '12794-10-4 (Benzodiazepines)', 'EC 2.5.- (Alkyl and Aryl Transferases)', 'EC 2.5.1.29 (Farnesyltranstransferase)', 'L2U9GFD244', '(7-cyano-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1-(1H-imidazol-4-ylmethyl)-3-(phenylmethyl)-4-(2-thie', 'nylsulfonyl)-1H-1,4-benzodiazepine)']",IM,"['Alkyl and Aryl Transferases/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/physiology', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'Benzodiazepines/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Farnesyltranstransferase', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/*pharmacology', 'Membrane Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Multiple Myeloma/enzymology/*pathology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/antagonists & inhibitors/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects/physiology', 'bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein']",2005/03/02 09:00,2005/07/15 09:00,['2005/03/02 09:00'],"['2005/03/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/15 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/02 09:00 [entrez]']","['mol.104.007021 [pii]', '10.1124/mol.104.007021 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 2005 Jun;67(6):1991-8. doi: 10.1124/mol.104.007021.

It is the most common form of leukemia in North America and Europe. The management of CLL is determined by the stage and activity of the disease. Several randomized studies indicate that cytotoxic therapy based on alkylating agents in the indolent phase of disease, does not prolong the survival time of CLL patients. Chlorambucil, with or without steroids, has been for many years the drug of choice in previously untreated patients with this leukemia. Alternative treatment approaches, including new purine nucleoside analogs (PNA), such as fludarabine and 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine (cladribine) have also shown activity in CLL. The randomized studies have indicated a higher overall response, complete remission rates and longer response duration in patients treated initially with PNA than with chlorambucil or cyclophosphamide based combination regimens. These agents alone or in combinations, seem to be the treatment of choice for patients failing standard therapies. The monoclonal antibodies directed against CD52 antigen (alemtuzumab, Campath-1H) and CD20 antigen (rituximab) demonstrate also significant activity in CLL patients. These agents have significant single-agent activity, distinct mechanism of action and generally, favorable toxicity profiles.

Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL) in children, however, differs from NHL in adults with respect to the classification, natural history, management and course. For practical reasons clinicians generally classify and treat NHL in children as either B-cell or T-cell disease. Over the past 22 years, the Paediatric Oncology Unit of the Tygerberg Hospital has treated HD with three different regimens. Use of the CLVPP and MOPP/ABVD regimens resulted in late relapses that adversely affected event free survival (EFS). For the last four years HD has been treated according to the regimen suggested by Schellong with good short term survival rates. Lymphoblastic or T-cell NHL is treated with regimens normally used for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (e.g. BFM protocols) or modified leukaemia treatments for leukaemia-lymphoma syndromes (e.g. LSA2L2). We lately use a modified BFM regimen with a 70% EFS for all stages. Three consecutive regimens have been used to treat B-cell NHL over the past 22 years. The first was a COMP regimen, followed by the LMB-89 and LMB-96 regimens. Although toxicity has increased with the increased intensity of the treatment regimen, EFS has improved from 25% to 87% for all B-cell NHL. The majority of patients had stage III and IV disease. Although the LMB regimens are toxic, the implementation is manageable provided good laboratory back up and supportive facilities are available.","['Wessels, Glynn', 'Bernard Hesseling, Peter']","['Wessels G', 'Bernard Hesseling P']","['Department of Paediatrics and Child Health, Stellenbosch University and Tygerberg Hospital, P.O.

Correlation between HIV-1 infectivity and fluidity was observed by treatment of fluidity-modulators, indicating that infectivity was dependent on fluidity. A 5% decrease in fluidity suppressed the HIV-1 infectivity by 56%. Contrarily, a 5% increase in fluidity augmented the infectivity by 2.4-fold. An increased temperature of 40 degrees C or treatment of 0.2% xylocaine after viral adsorption at room temperature enhanced the infectivity by 2.6- and 1.5-fold, respectively.

Many miRNAs cloned from mouse bone marrow cells are differentially regulated in various hematopoietic lineages, suggesting that they might influence hematopoietic lineage differentiation. miR-181, a miRNA specifically expressed in B cells within mouse bone marrow, promotes B-cell differentiation when expressed in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. Some human miRNAs are linked to leukemias: the miR-15a/miR-16 locus is frequently deleted or down-regulated in patients with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia and miR-142 is at a translocation site found in a case of aggressive B-cell leukemia. Collectively, these results indicate that miRNAs may be important regulators of mammalian hematopoiesis.

This reduction of TPMT activity in ALL patients was not due to differences in the frequency of mutations in the TPMT gene. In concordance with other authors, we found a higher TPMT activity during maintenance treatment with 6-mercaptopurine (6MP) than at diagnosis and in controls. However, we observed that TPMT activity was already significantly increased after the induction therapy, before the patients received 6MP (median 17.5; range 3.9-40.3 pmol/10(7) RBC*hr; n = 139).

The Promyelocytic Leukaemia gene product PML plays an important role in cell growth and survival, and resides in discrete subnuclear structures called Nuclear Bodies (NB). We performed comparative analysis of the expression of 40 Myc target genes and of Myc binding to their regulatory regions both in wild-type and PML knockout cells. We demonstrate that if PML is absent, despite Myc binding to the DNA regulatory sequences is unchanged, the expression profile of several Myc target genes is altered. PML is largely involved in gene regulation, via recruitment of several transcription factors and cofactors to the NB. Consistently, we show that Myc partially localizes to the NB and physically interacts with PML, and that this localization depends on Myc expression levels. As deregulation occurs to both activated and repressed Myc target genes, we propose that PML influences Myc transcriptional activity through a mechanism that involves the control of Myc post-translational modifications.","['Cairo, Stefano', 'De Falco, Francesca', 'Pizzo, Mariateresa', 'Salomoni, Paolo', 'Pandolfi, Pier Paolo', 'Meroni, Germana']","['Cairo S', 'De Falco F', 'Pizzo M', 'Salomoni P', 'Pandolfi PP', 'Meroni G']","['Telethon Institute of Genetics and Medicine, 80131 Naples, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Pml protein, mouse)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Fibroblasts/physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes, myc', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Proteins/deficiency/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/deficiency/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/*metabolism', 'RNA/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Transcription Factors/deficiency/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",2005/03/01 09:00,2005/04/19 09:00,['2005/03/01 09:00'],"['2005/03/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/19 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['1208338 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.onc.1208338 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2005 Mar 24;24(13):2195-203. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1208338.,,,,"['TGM03Z05/Telethon/Italy', 'TGM06S01/Telethon/Italy']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Wnt stimulation leads to beta-catenin accumulation, nuclear translocation and interaction with T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor (TCF/LEF) transcription factors to regulate genes important for embryonic development and proliferation. Wnt/beta-catenin can promote stem cell self-renewal and is dysregulated in colon carcinoma. We have examined the role of the Wnt pathway in the development of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and find that the beta-catenin protein is readily detected in primary AML samples. Using transfection of a TCF/LEF reporter construct into primary AML cells and normal human progenitors, we find increased reporter activity in 16/25 leukaemia samples. Retrovirally mediated expression of a mutant active beta-catenin in normal progenitors preserves CD34 expression and impairs myelomonocytic differentiation. Activation of TCF/LEF signalling decreases factor withdrawal-induced apoptosis of normal progenitors. A significant proportion of AML cases show aberrant expression of components of the Wnt pathway including Wnt-1, Wnt-2b and LEF-1.

Dysfunctional or deregulated apoptosis can potentially contribute to the development of immune deficiencies, autoimmune diseases, and leukemia. Control of homeostasis starts at the level of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC). To this end, we found that CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells are constitutively resistant to CD95-mediated apoptosis and cannot be sensitized during short-term culture to death receptor-mediated apoptosis by cytokines. Detailed analysis of the death machinery revealed that CD34+ cells do not express caspase-8a/b, a crucial constituent of the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) of death receptors. Instead, we found a smaller splice variant termed caspase-8L to be present in HSC. Forced expression of caspase-8L using a recombinant lentiviral vector was able to protect hematopoietic cells from death receptor-induced apoptosis even in the presence of caspase-8a/b. Furthermore, we found that caspase-8L is recruited to the DISC after CD95 triggering, thereby preventing CD95 from connecting to the caspase cascade. These results demonstrate an antiapoptotic function of caspase-8L and suggest a critical role as apoptosis regulator in HSC.

It may develop from a premalignant condition (monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance, MGUS) or progress from intramedullary to extramedullary forms (plasma cell leukemia, PCL). To provide insights into the molecular characterization of plasma cell dyscrasias and to investigate the contribution of specific genetic lesions to the biological and clinical heterogeneity of MM, we analysed the gene expression profiles of plasma cells isolated from seven MGUS, 39 MM and six PCL patients by means of DNA microarrays. MMs resulted highly heterogeneous at transcriptional level, whereas the differential expression of genes mainly involved in DNA metabolism and proliferation distinguished MGUS from PCLs and the majority of MM cases. The clustering of MM patients was mainly driven by the presence of the most recurrent translocations involving the immunoglobulin heavy-chain locus. Distinct gene expression patterns have been found to be associated with different lesions: the overexpression of CCND2 and genes involved in cell adhesion pathways was observed in cases with deregulated MAF and MAFB, whereas genes upregulated in cases with the t(4;14) showed apoptosis-related functions. The peculiar finding in patients with the t(11;14) was the downregulation of the alpha-subunit of the IL-6 receptor.

Stimulation of glucose uptake appears to play an important role in the suppression of apoptosis by this cytokine in normal haemopoietic cells. To investigate whether the cell survival mechanisms mediated by the oncoprotein and cytokine showed any similarities, we employed a haemopoietic cell line, TonB210, engineered for inducible expression of Bcr-Abl. Tyrosine kinase expression in cytokine-deprived cells was found to mimic the effect of IL-3 in maintaining a higher V(max) for hexose uptake. In both IL-3- treated cells and those expressing Bcr-Abl, high rates of hexose uptake were associated with the retention at the cell surface of approximately 80% of the total cellular content of the GLUT1 glucose transporter. In contrast, treatment of Bcr-Abl-expressing cells for 6 h with the Bcr-Abl kinase inhibitor Glivec (10 muM), in the absence of IL-3, led to internalization of approximately 90% of the cell-surface transporters and drastically decreased (4.4+/-0.9 (mean+/-s.e.m., 4)-fold) the V(max) for hexose uptake, without significant effect on the K(m) for this process or on the total cellular transporter content. These effects were not the result of any significant loss in cell viability, and preceded the onset of apoptosis caused by inhibition of Bcr-Abl. Both IL-3 treatment and expression of Bcr-Abl led to enhanced phosphorylation of Akt (protein kinase B). The stimulation of transport by IL-3 and Bcr-Abl in TonB210 cells was inhibitable by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitors, indicating the involvement of this kinase in the signal transduction pathway. These findings suggest that inhibition of glucose transport plays an important role in the therapeutic action of Glivec, and that the signal transduction pathways involved in transport stimulation by Bcr-Abl may offer novel therapeutic targets for CML.","['Barnes, Kay', 'McIntosh, Elizabeth', 'Whetton, Anthony D', 'Daley, George Q', 'Bentley, Johanne', 'Baldwin, Stephen A']","['Barnes K', 'McIntosh E', 'Whetton AD', 'Daley GQ', 'Bentley J', 'Baldwin SA']","['School of Biochemistry and Microbiology, University of Leeds, Leeds LS2 9JT, UK. k.barnes@leeds.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Annexin A5)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Glucose Transporter Type 1)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Monosaccharide Transport Proteins)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (SLC2A1 protein, human)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', '9G2MP84A8W (Deoxyglucose)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (AKT1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)', 'N12000U13O (Doxycycline)']",IM,"['Annexin A5/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Benzamides', 'Biological Transport', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Survival', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Deoxyglucose/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Doxycycline/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*metabolism', 'Glucose/*metabolism', 'Glucose Transporter Type 1', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Interleukin-3/metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*metabolism', 'Monosaccharide Transport Proteins/metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'Temperature', 'Time Factors']",2005/03/01 09:00,2005/06/01 09:00,['2005/03/01 09:00'],"['2005/03/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/01 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['1208461 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.onc.1208461 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2005 May 5;24(20):3257-67. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1208461.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

APL patients respond to pharmacological concentrations of all-trans retinoic acid (RA) and disease remission correlates with terminal differentiation of leukemic blasts. The PML/RAR oncogenic transcription factor is responsible for both the pathogenesis of APL and for its sensitivity to RA. In order to identify physiological targets of RA therapy, we analysed gene expression profiles of RA-treated APL blasts and found 1056 common target genes. Comparing these results to those obtained in RA-treated U937 cell lines revealed that transcriptional response to RA is largely dependent on the expression of PML/RAR. Several genes involved in the control of differentiation and stem cell renewal are early targets of RA regulation, and may be important effectors of RA response. Modulation of chromatin modifying genes was also observed, suggesting that specific structural changes in local chromatin domains may be required to promote RA-mediated differentiation. Computational analysis of upstream genomic regions in RA target genes revealed nonrandom distribution of transcription factor binding sites, indicating that specific transcriptional regulatory complexes may be involved in determining RA response.","['Meani, Natalia', 'Minardi, Simone', 'Licciulli, Silvia', 'Gelmetti, Vania', 'Coco, Francesco Lo', 'Nervi, Clara', 'Pelicci, Pier Giuseppe', 'Muller, Heiko', 'Alcalay, Myriam']","['Meani N', 'Minardi S', 'Licciulli S', 'Gelmetti V', 'Coco FL', 'Nervi C', 'Pelicci PG', 'Muller H', 'Alcalay M']","['Institute of Molecular Oncology of the Italian Foundation for Cancer Research, Via Adamello 16, 20139 Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)']",IM,"['Binding Sites', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromatin/metabolism', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Exons', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/*genetics/metabolism', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'RNA/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tretinoin/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'U937 Cells']",2005/03/01 09:00,2005/06/01 09:00,['2005/03/01 09:00'],"['2005/03/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/01 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['1208498 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.onc.1208498 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2005 May 5;24(20):3358-68. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1208498.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since normal hematopoietic cells in marrow and spleen are replaced with proliferating leukemic blasts, we determined whether this is an active process mediated by the leukemia cells. The lipocalin 24p3 was reported to be secreted by mouse hematopoietic cells deprived of IL-3, resulting in apoptosis induction in a variety of hematopoietic cells including bone marrow cells. Here, we show that BCR-ABL+ mouse hematopoietic cells induced persistent expression and secretion of 24p3. Importantly, BCR-ABL+ hematopoietic cells were resistant to the apoptotic effects of 24p3. The expression of the Bcr-Abl oncoprotein and its tyrosine kinase were required for induction of 24p3 expression. Co-culture studies showed that BCR-ABL+ cells induced apoptosis in BCR-ABL negative cells. Antisense 24p3/siRNA expression reduced the level of 24p3 protein in both BCR-ABL+ cells and in conditioned medium (CM) obtained from these cells. CM from BCR-ABL+ cells expressing antisense 24p3/siRNA had reduced apoptotic activity for target cells; 24p3 antibody also reduced the apoptotic activity of the CM. Leukemic mice induced by BCR-ABL+ cells expressing either antisense 24p3 or 24p3 siRNA had increased levels of normal hematopoiesis and reduced invasion of leukemia cells in marrow and spleen tissues. These findings indicate that suppression of normal hematopoiesis in BCR-ABL-induced leukemia is an active process involving secretion of the cell death-inducing factor 24p3 by mouse leukemia cells, raising the possibility that similar factors are involved in BCR-ABL+ CML.","['Lin, Hui', 'Monaco, Giuseppe', 'Sun, Tong', 'Ling, Xiaoyang', 'Stephens, Clifton', 'Xie, Shanhai', 'Belmont, John', 'Arlinghaus, Ralph']","['Lin H', 'Monaco G', 'Sun T', 'Ling X', 'Stephens C', 'Xie S', 'Belmont J', 'Arlinghaus R']","['Department of Molecular Pathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Acute-Phase Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Lipocalin-2)', '0 (Lipocalins)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '126469-30-5 (Lcn2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'F8VB5M810T (Tetracycline)']",IM,"['Acute-Phase Proteins/*physiology', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Blotting, Western', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism', 'Cell Death', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/metabolism/*physiology', 'Hematopoiesis/*physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/metabolism', 'Lentivirus/genetics', 'Leukemia/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Lipocalin-2', 'Lipocalins', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/pharmacology', 'Oncogene Proteins/*physiology', 'Plasmids/metabolism', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Spleen/metabolism', 'Tetracycline/pharmacology', 'Time Factors']",2005/03/01 09:00,2005/06/01 09:00,['2005/03/01 09:00'],"['2005/03/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/01 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['1208500 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.onc.1208500 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2005 May 5;24(20):3246-56. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1208500.,,,,"['CA16672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA49639/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Tax protein of the human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-1) deregulates cell growth and alters the role of IL-2 in infected cells. However, Tax-immortalized cells stay dependent on IL-2, suggesting that events besides HTLV-1 gene expression are required for leukemia to develop. Here, IL-2-dependent and -independent events were analysed in a human T cell line immortalized by Tax. These studies show that, of the signaling pathways evaluated, only STAT5 remains dependent. Microarray analyses revealed several genes, including il-5, il-9 and il-13, are uniquely upregulated by IL-2 in the presence of Tax. Bioinformatics and supporting molecular biology show that some of these genes are STAT5 targets, explaining their IL-2 upregulation. These results suggest that IL-2 and viral proteins work together to induce gene expression, promoting the hypothesis that deregulation via the constitutive activation of STAT5 may lead to the IL-2-independent phenotype of HTLV-1-transformed cells.","['Fung, Michelle M', 'Chu, Yen-Lin', 'Fink, J Lynn', 'Wallace, Anne', 'McGuire, Kathleen L']","['Fung MM', 'Chu YL', 'Fink JL', 'Wallace A', 'McGuire KL']","['Department of Biology, San Diego State University, 5500 Campanile Drive, San Diego, CA 92182-4614, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Milk Proteins)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Trans-Activators)']",IM,"['Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cytokines/*biosynthesis', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Products, tax/*biosynthesis', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/*metabolism', 'Milk Proteins/*metabolism', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Phenotype', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor', 'Signal Transduction', 'Thymus Gland/cytology', 'Trans-Activators/*metabolism']",2005/03/01 09:00,2005/08/03 09:00,['2005/03/01 09:00'],"['2005/03/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/03 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['1208507 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.onc.1208507 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2005 Jul 7;24(29):4624-33. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1208507.,,,,['P41 RR08605-08/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

The underlying biologic and genetic reasons for this resistance are complex, but the bcl-2 gene family seems to play a critical role. This retrospective study assessed the clinical impact of a common single nucleotide polymorphism of the pro-apoptotic bax gene in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The frequency of the novel polymorphism, G(-248)A, in the promoter region of the bax gene and bax protein expression was assessed in 203 CLL patients. The results were correlated with clinical outcome. RESULTS: The polymorphism was found in 23% of the CLL cohort and 15% of normal controls with no significant difference in allele frequency between the two groups (P = .15). It was associated with lower Bax protein expression and a shorter overall survival, especially in the treated patient group (P = .03). Furthermore, the adverse impact of the polymorphism was accentuated when comparing survival from the date of first treatment rather than diagnosis (P = .012). No significant difference in age at diagnosis, stage of disease at presentation, lymphocyte doubling time, time to first treatment, or progression-free survival were observed. CONCLUSION: The presence of this single nucleotide polymorphism in CLL critically influences the response to treatment and overall survival. Given the relatively high prevalence of this polymorphism in the normal population, further prospective studies in CLL and other human malignancies are indicated.","['Starczynski, Jane', 'Pepper, Chris', 'Pratt, Guy', 'Hooper, Laura', 'Thomas, Alun', 'Milligan, Donald', 'Bentley, Paul', 'Fegan, Christopher']","['Starczynski J', 'Pepper C', 'Pratt G', 'Hooper L', 'Thomas A', 'Milligan D', 'Bentley P', 'Fegan C']","['Department of Haematology, Heartlands Hospital, Bordesley Green E, Birmingham, UK B91 1JR.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genes, bcl-2/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/*mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Prognosis', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*genetics', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein']",2005/03/01 09:00,2005/03/26 09:00,['2005/03/01 09:00'],"['2005/03/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/26 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['23/7/1514 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2005.02.192 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2005 Mar 1;23(7):1514-21. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2005.02.192.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In a previous study, it was demonstrated that quercetin and ellagic acid interacted synergistically in the induction of apoptosis in the human leukemia cell line, MOLT-4. To investigate possible cellular mechanisms, this study evaluated whether synergistic effects might be detectable within proapoptotic or antiproliferative signal transduction pathways. We found that quercetin and combinations of quercetin and ellagic acid nonsynergistically increased p53 protein levels. In contrast, ellagic acid potentiated the effects of quercetin for p21(cip1/waf1) protein levels and p53 phosphorylation at serine 15, possibly explaining the synergistic effect observed in apoptosis induction. Phosphorylation of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases, c-jun N-terminal (JNK)1,2 and p38, was also increased by the combination of ellagic acid and quercetin, whereas quercetin alone induced only p38. We further evaluated whether the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and/or quercetin stability were influenced by interactions of ellagic acid with quercetin. Quercetin increased the generation of ROS, which was neither potentiated nor inhibited by ellagic acid. The stability of intracellular and extracellular quercetin was not influenced by the presence of ellagic acid. In summary, quercetin and ellagic acid combined increase the activation of p53 and p21(cip1/waf1) and the MAP kinases, JNK1,2 and p38, in a more than additive manner, suggesting a mechanism by which quercetin and ellagic acid synergistically induce apoptosis in cancer cells.","['Mertens-Talcott, Susanne U', 'Bomser, Joshua A', 'Romero, Carlos', 'Talcott, Stephen T', 'Percival, Susan S']","['Mertens-Talcott SU', 'Bomser JA', 'Romero C', 'Talcott ST', 'Percival SS']","['Department of Food Science and Human Nutrition, Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL 32611-0370, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",,United States,J Nutr,The Journal of nutrition,0404243,"['0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '19YRN3ZS9P (Ellagic Acid)', '9IKM0I5T1E (Quercetin)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Cell Cycle Proteins/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'DNA Primers', 'Ellagic Acid/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Models, Biological', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Phosphorylation', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Quercetin/*pharmacology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*metabolism']",2005/03/01 09:00,2005/04/15 09:00,['2005/03/01 09:00'],"['2005/03/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/15 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['135/3/609 [pii]', '10.1093/jn/135.3.609 [doi]']",ppublish,J Nutr. 2005 Mar;135(3):609-14. doi: 10.1093/jn/135.3.609.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Imatinib inhibited the growth of primary murine lung fibroblasts and the autophosphorylation of PDGFR-beta induced by PDGF. Administration of imatinib significantly prevented bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in mice, partly by reducing the number of mesenchymal cells incorporating bromodeoxyuridine. Analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage cells demonstrated that imatinib did not suppress early inflammation on Days 7 and 14 caused by bleomycin.

This has prompted the development of selective small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors against FLT3. However, like most tyrosine kinase inhibitors, those against FLT3 are not completely specific and at the doses required to completely inhibit target, significant toxicities may occur. In addition, tyrosine kinase inhibitors for other kinases have been shown to select for cells that become resistant. To overcome some of these limitations we developed two fully human phage display monoclonal antibodies against FLT3 (IMC-EB10 and IMC-NC7). These antibodies inhibited ligand-mediated activation of wild-type FLT3 and constitutively activated mutant FLT3 and in most cell types affected downstream STAT5, AKT, and mitogen-activated protein kinase activation. In addition to interfering with FLT3 signaling, IMC-EB10 and, to a significantly lesser extent, IMC-NC7 initiated antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity on FLT3-expressing cells. When IMC-EB10 was used in vivo to treat nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient mice given injections of primary FLT3/ITD acute myelogenous leukemia samples or myeloid cell lines with FLT3 expression, it significantly decreased engraftment of leukemic cells and increased survival, respectively. In contrast, IMC-EB10 treatment did not reduce engraftment of normal human CD34+ cord blood cells nor did it show any significant inhibition of normal murine hematopoiesis. Thus, these types of antibodies have the potential to be safe and effective new therapeutic agents for acute myelogenous leukemia and possibly other FLT3-expressing malignancies.","['Piloto, Obdulio', 'Levis, Mark', 'Huso, David', 'Li, Yiwen', 'Li, Hongli', 'Wang, Mei-Nai', 'Bassi, Rajiv', 'Balderes, Paul', 'Ludwig, Dale L', 'Witte, Larry', 'Zhu, Zhenping', 'Hicklin, Daniel J', 'Small, Donald']","['Piloto O', 'Levis M', 'Huso D', 'Li Y', 'Li H', 'Wang MN', 'Bassi R', 'Balderes P', 'Ludwig DL', 'Witte L', 'Zhu Z', 'Hicklin DJ', 'Small D']","['Department of Oncology and Comparative Medicine, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, USA. opiloto1@jhmi.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Flt3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology/*pharmacology', 'Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity', 'Antigens, CD34/biosynthesis/immunology', 'Fetal Blood/cytology/immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/enzymology/*immunology/pathology/*therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/immunology', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/immunology', 'Signal Transduction/immunology', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3']",2005/03/01 09:00,2005/04/05 09:00,['2005/03/01 09:00'],"['2005/03/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/05 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['65/4/1514 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-04-3081 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2005 Feb 15;65(4):1514-22. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-04-3081.,,,,"['CA100632/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA62924/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA70970/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA90668/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'RR00171/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although good-prognosis ALL is thought to originate in a lymphoid progenitor, it is unclear if this applies to high-risk ALL. Therefore, immature CD34(+)CD19(-) bone marrow cells from 8 children with ALL/t(9;22) and 12 with ALL/t(4;11) were purified and analyzed by fluorescence in situ hybridization, reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR), and colony assays. Fifty-six percent (n = 8, SD 31%) and 68% (n = 12, SD 26%) of CD34(+)CD19(-) cells in ALL/t(9;22) and ALL/t(4;11), respectively, carried the translocation. In addition, 5 of 168 (3%) and 22 of 228 (10%) myeloerythroid colonies expressed BCR/ABL and MLL/AF4. RT-PCR results were confirmed by sequence analysis. Interestingly, in some patients with ALL/t(4;11), alternative splicing was seen in myeloid progenitors compared with the bulk leukemic population, suggesting that these myeloid colonies might be part of the leukemic cell clone. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis, however, shows that none of these myeloid colonies (0 of 41 RT-PCR-positive colonies) originated from a progenitor cell that carries the leukemia-specific translocation. Thus, leukemic, translocation-positive CD34(+)CD19(-) progenitor/stem cells that were copurified by cell sorting were able to survive in these colony assays for up to 28 days allowing amplification of the respective fusion transcripts by sensitive RT-PCR. In conclusion, we show that childhood high-risk ALL/t(9;22) and t(4;11) originate in a primitive CD34(+)CD19(-) progenitor/stem cell without a myeloerythroid developmental potential.","['Hotfilder, Marc', 'Rottgers, Silja', 'Rosemann, Annegret', 'Schrauder, Andre', 'Schrappe, Martin', 'Pieters, Rob', 'Jurgens, Heribert', 'Harbott, Jochen', 'Vormoor, Josef']","['Hotfilder M', 'Rottgers S', 'Rosemann A', 'Schrauder A', 'Schrappe M', 'Pieters R', 'Jurgens H', 'Harbott J', 'Vormoor J']","[""Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Children's Hospital Munster, Munster, Germany.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (MLL-AF4 fusion protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antigens, CD19/*biosynthesis', 'Antigens, CD34/*biosynthesis', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 22/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 4/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9/genetics', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Genes, abl/genetics', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/immunology/*pathology/ultrastructure', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/immunology/*pathology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Translocation, Genetic/*genetics']",2005/03/01 09:00,2005/04/05 09:00,['2005/03/01 09:00'],"['2005/03/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/05 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['65/4/1442 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-04-1356 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2005 Feb 15;65(4):1442-9. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-04-1356.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We previously reported that expression of the RUNX1/MTG8 target gene IL-3 is synergistically restored by the combination of inhibitors of HDACs (i.e., depsipeptide) and DNA methyltransferases (DNMT; i.e., decitabine) in RUNX1/MTG8-positive Kasumi-1 cells. Thus, we hypothesized that DNMT1 is also part of the transcriptional repressor complex recruited by RUNX1/MTG8. By a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, we identified a RUNX1/MTG8-DNMT1 complex on the IL-3 promoter in Kasumi-1 cells and in primary RUNX1/MTG8-positive AML blasts. The physical association of RUNX1/MTG8 with DNMT1 was shown by coimmunoprecipitation experiments. Furthermore, RUNX1/MTG8 and DNMT1 were concurrently released from the IL-3 promoter by exposure to depsipeptide or stabilized on the promoter by decitabine treatment. Finally, we proved that RUNX1/MTG8 and DNMT1 were functionally interrelated by showing an enhanced repression of IL-3 after coexpression in 293T cells. These results suggest a novel mechanism for gene silencing mediated by RUNX1/MTG8 and support the combination of HDAC and DNMT inhibitors as a novel therapeutic approach for t(8;21) AML.","['Liu, Shujun', 'Shen, Tiansheng', 'Huynh, Lenguyen', 'Klisovic, Marko I', 'Rush, Laura J', 'Ford, Jamie L', 'Yu, Jianhua', 'Becknell, Brian', 'Li, Yu', 'Liu, Chunhui', 'Vukosavljevic, Tamara', 'Whitman, Susan P', 'Chang, Kun-Sang', 'Byrd, John C', 'Perrotti, Danilo', 'Plass, Christoph', 'Marcucci, Guido']","['Liu S', 'Shen T', 'Huynh L', 'Klisovic MI', 'Rush LJ', 'Ford JL', 'Yu J', 'Becknell B', 'Li Y', 'Liu C', 'Vukosavljevic T', 'Whitman SP', 'Chang KS', 'Byrd JC', 'Perrotti D', 'Plass C', 'Marcucci G']","['Divisions of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine and the Comprehensive Cancer Center, Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (RUNX1T1 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase 1)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNMT1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase 1', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases/*metabolism', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/physiology', 'Gene Silencing', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/enzymology/genetics/*metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Transcription, Genetic/physiology', 'Transfection']",2005/03/01 09:00,2005/04/05 09:00,['2005/03/01 09:00'],"['2005/03/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/05 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['65/4/1277 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-04-4532 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2005 Feb 15;65(4):1277-84. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-04-4532.,,,,"['K08-CA90469/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30-CA16058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA102031/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21-CA094552/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hitherto, investigating the fate of premalignant cells in vivo remained strongly hampered by the fact that these cells are usually indistinguishable from their normal counterparts. Here, for the first time, we have designed a strategy able to reconstitute the replicative history of the bona fide premalignant clone in an animal model, the sheep experimentally infected with the lymphotropic bovine leukemia virus. We have shown that premalignant clones are early and clearly distinguished from other virus-exposed cells on the basis of their degree of clonal expansion and genetic instability. Detectable as early as 0.5 month after the beginning of virus exposure, premalignant cells displayed a two-step pattern of extensive clonal expansion together with a mutation load approximately 6 times higher than that of other virus-exposed cells that remained untransformed during the life span of investigated animals. There was no fixation of somatic mutations over time, suggesting that they regularly lead to cellular death, partly contributing to maintain a normal lymphocyte count during the prolonged premalignant stage. This equilibrium was finally broken after a period of 18.5 to 60 months of clinical latency, when a dramatic decrease in the genetic instability of premalignant cells coincided with a rapid increase in lymphocyte count and lymphoma onset.","['Moules, Vincent', 'Pomier, Carole', 'Sibon, David', 'Gabet, Anne-Sophie', 'Reichert, Michal', 'Kerkhofs, Pierre', 'Willems, Luc', 'Mortreux, Franck', 'Wattel, Eric']","['Moules V', 'Pomier C', 'Sibon D', 'Gabet AS', 'Reichert M', 'Kerkhofs P', 'Willems L', 'Mortreux F', 'Wattel E']","['Oncovirologie et Biotherapies, UMR5537 CNRS-Universite Claude Bernard, Centre Leon Berard, Lyon, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cattle', 'Cell Transformation, Viral/physiology', 'Clone Cells', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Leukemia/genetics/*pathology/virology', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/genetics', 'Lymphoma/genetics/*pathology/virology', 'Mutation', 'Precancerous Conditions/genetics/*pathology/virology', 'Sheep', 'Sheep Diseases/virology', 'Virus Integration']",2005/03/01 09:00,2005/04/05 09:00,['2005/03/01 09:00'],"['2005/03/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/05 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['65/4/1234 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-04-1834 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2005 Feb 15;65(4):1234-43. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-04-1834.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Peliosis has been related to several underlying debilitating illnesses such as tuberculosis, hematological malignancies, the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), and post-transplant immunodeficiency, as well as intravenous drug abuse, chronic alcoholism, and in conjunction with the intake of oral contraceptives or steroids. The classical pathoanatomical concept is based upon the opinion that peliosis exclusively develops in organs belonging to the mononuclear phagocytic system (liver, spleen, bone marrow, and lymph nodes). However, a paucity of studies indicates that other organs such as lungs, parathyroid glands, and kidneys may be affected too. Concerning the underlying pathogenetic mechanisms of onset and maintenance of peliosis, the morphological data obtained by different investigators suggest that there is more than one path of formal pathogenesis (e.g., congenital malformation of vessels manifesting under altered local intravascular pressure conditions, acquired vascular disorder triggered by toxic noxae, active proliferation of vessels corresponding to the benign end on the spectrum of neoplastic vascular lesions). In the liver, at gross inspection, the peliotic lesions give the cut sections a ""swiss cheese"" appearance. Microscopically, two different types of peliosis can be distinguished in the liver: (1) ""parenchymal peliosis"" consisting of irregular cavities that are neither lined by sinusoidal cells nor by fibrous tissue, and (2) ""phlebectatic peliosis"" characterized by regular, spherical cavities lined by endothelium and/or fibrosis. One of the differential diagnoses that most closely resembles peliosis hepatis is secondary hepatic congestion due to veno-occlusive disease or the Budd-Chiari syndrome. In the spleen, the peliotic lesions may be arranged sporadically, disseminated, or in clusters in an uneven distribution pattern. Histologically, the cavities show frequently well-demarcated margins that may appear focally lined by sinusoidal endothelium, or totally lack a clear cell lining. Differential diagnoses are hemangiomas and involvement of the spleen in hairy-cell leukaemia. Since the disease may culminate in spontaneous rupture of the affected organ and thus may mimic a violent death at autopsy, peliosis is far more than just another morphological curiosity. Awareness of peliosis at autopsy as well as an appreciation for the histopathological changes in less characteristic or advanced cases may become an important issue for both the forensic and clinical pathologist.","['Tsokos, Michael', 'Erbersdobler, Andreas']","['Tsokos M', 'Erbersdobler A']","['Department of Forensic Pathology, Institute of Legal Medicine, University of Hamburg, Butenfeld 34, 22529 Hamburg, Germany. mtsokos@web.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Ireland,Forensic Sci Int,Forensic science international,7902034,,IM,"['Bone Marrow Diseases/pathology', 'Diagnosis, Differential', '*Forensic Pathology', 'Humans', 'Kidney Diseases/pathology', 'Lung Diseases/pathology', 'Lymphatic Diseases/pathology', 'Parathyroid Diseases/pathology', 'Peliosis Hepatis/etiology/*pathology', 'Splenic Diseases/pathology']",2005/03/01 09:00,2005/05/27 09:00,['2005/03/01 09:00'],"['2004/01/20 00:00 [received]', '2004/05/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/03/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/05/27 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0379073804003421 [pii]', '10.1016/j.forsciint.2004.05.010 [doi]']",ppublish,Forensic Sci Int. 2005 Apr 20;149(1):25-33. doi: 10.1016/j.forsciint.2004.05.010.,47,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: Fundus examination revealed a SRD involving the fovea, OU. Fluorescein angiography disclosed multifocal spots of hyperfluorescence in the early phase, and diffuse subretinal accumulation of fluorescein in the late phase.

However, it lacks direct evidences whether copper-inhibited histone acetylation right contributes to the toxicity of copper. Exposure of human leukemia cells (HL-60) to Cu2+ resulted in cell proliferation arrest and a concentration- and time-dependent decrease of histone acetylation. At the same time, Cu2+-induced significant increase of H2O2 and O2.- generation via a concentration- and time-dependent manner too. The histone acetylation was efficiently suppressed by exogenous H2O2, and enhanced by superoxide dismutase (the scavenger of O2.-), catalase (the scavenger of H2O2) or the combination of both, indicating that Cu2+ at least partially inhibited histone acetylation through triggering oxidative stress. Further studies found that sodium butyrate, the inhibitor of histone deacetylase (HDAC), which had no obvious effect on oxidative stress but increased histone acetylation at the concentration of 50 microM, attenuated Cu2+-inhibited cell proliferation, indicating that histone acetylation inhibition is simultaneously involved in the cytotoxicity of Cu2+.

The proteins were separated by two-dimensional electrophoresis and quantified using an image evaluation system. Proteins exhibiting significant radiation-induced alterations in abundance were identified by peptide mass fingerprinting. We identified 14 proteins that were either up- or down-regulated. Cellular levels of four of the proteins (Rho GDP dissociation inhibitor 1 and 2, Ran binding protein 1, serine/threonine protein kinase PAK2) were further analyzed by two-dimensional immunoblotting to confirm the data obtained from proteome analysis.

Because of its relatively long life and high permeability across membranes, H(2)O(2) is thought to be an important second messenger. Generation of H(2)O(2) is increased in response to external insults, including radiation. Catalase is located at the peroxisome and scavenges H(2)O(2). In this study, we investigated the role of catalase in cell growth using the H(2)O(2)-resistant variant HP100-1 of human promyelocytic HL60 cells. HP100-1 cells had an almost 10-fold higher activity of catalase than HL60 cells without differences in levels of glutathione peroxidase, manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD), and copper-zinc SOD (CuZnSOD). HP100-1 cells had higher proliferative activity than HL60 cells. Treatment with catalase or the introduction of catalase cDNA into HL60 cells stimulated cell growth. Exposure of HP100-1 cells to a catalase inhibitor resulted in suppression of cell growth with concomitant increased levels of intracellular H(2)O(2). Moreover, exogenously added H(2)O(2) or depletion of glutathione suppressed cell growth in HL60 cells. Extracellular signal regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) was constitutively phosphorylated in HP100-1 cells but not in HL60 cells. Inhibition of the ERK1/2 pathway suppressed the growth of HP100-1 cells, but inhibition of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38MAPK) did not affect growth. Moreover, inhibition of catalase blocked the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 but not of p38MAPK in HP100-1 cells. Thus our results suggest that catalase activates the growth of HL60 cells through dismutation of H(2)O(2), leading to activation of the ERK1/2 pathway; H(2)O(2) is an important regulator of growth in HL60 cells.","['Hachiya, Misao', 'Akashi, Makoto']","['Hachiya M', 'Akashi M']","['Department of Radiation Emergency Medicine, The Research Center for Radiation Emergency Medicine, National Institute of Radiological Sciences, Chiba-city, Chiba 263-8555, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Radiat Res,Radiation research,0401245,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'EC 1.11.1.6 (Catalase)', 'EC 1.15.1.1 (Superoxide Dismutase)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)']",IM,"['Antioxidants/metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'Catalase/*metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation', 'DNA/chemistry', 'DNA, Complementary/metabolism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Glutathione/metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*enzymology/pathology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Superoxide Dismutase/metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Transfection', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism']",2005/03/01 09:00,2005/04/09 09:00,['2005/03/01 09:00'],"['2005/03/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/09 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['RR3306 [pii]', '10.1667/rr3306 [doi]']",ppublish,Radiat Res. 2005 Mar;163(3):271-82. doi: 10.1667/rr3306.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since radiation is a well-known inducer of both leukemia and chromosomal translocations, it has long been suspected that radiation might cause leukemia by inducing specific translocations. However, recent studies clearly indicate that spontaneous translocations specific to acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) actually occur much more frequently than do leukemia cases with the same translocations. Moreover, the ALL-associated translocation-bearing cells are often found to have clonally expanded in individuals who do not develop ALL. Since radiation-induced DNA damage is generated essentially randomly in the genome, it does not seem likely that radiation could ever be responsible for the induction of identical translocations of relevance to ALL in multiple cells of an individual and hence be the primary cause of radiation-related leukemia. An alternative hypothesis described here is that the radiation-related ALL risk for a population is almost entirely attributable to a small number of predisposed individuals in whom relatively large numbers of translocation-carrying pre-ALL cells have accumulated. This preleukemic clone hypothesis explains various known characteristics of radiation-related ALL and implies that people who do not have substantial numbers of preleukemic cells (i.e. the great majority) are likely at low risk of developing leukemia. The hypothesis can also be applied to chronic myelogenous leukemia and to young-at-exposure cases of acute myelogenous leukemia.","['Nakamura, Nori']",['Nakamura N'],"['Department of Genetics, Radiation Effects Research Foundation, 5-2 Hijiyama Park, Minami-ku, Hiroshima 732-0815, Japan.

To extend the technique to the expression and selection of antibody libraries in an eukaryotic environment, we provide here a proof of concept that retroviruses can be engineered for the display and selection of variable single-chain fragment (scFv) libraries. A retroviral library displaying the repertoire obtained after a single round of selection of a human synthetic scFv phage display library on laminin was generated. For selection, antigen-bound virus was efficiently recovered by an overlay with cells permissive for infection. This approach allowed more than 10(3)-fold enrichment of antigen binders in a single selection cycle. After three selection cycles, several scFvs were recovered showing similar laminin-binding activities but improved expression levels in mammalian cells as compared with a laminin-specific scFv selected by the conventional phage display approach. Thus, translational problems that occur when phage-selected antibodies have to be transferred onto mammalian expression systems to exert their therapeutic potential can be avoided by the use of retroviral display libraries.","['Urban, Johannes H', 'Schneider, Richard M', 'Compte, Marta', 'Finger, Carsten', 'Cichutek, Klaus', 'Alvarez-Vallina, Luis', 'Buchholz, Christian J']","['Urban JH', 'Schneider RM', 'Compte M', 'Finger C', 'Cichutek K', 'Alvarez-Vallina L', 'Buchholz CJ']","['Medizinische Biotechnologie, Paul-Ehrlich-Institut 63225 Langen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20050224,England,Nucleic Acids Res,Nucleic acids research,0411011,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Laminin)', '0 (Peptide Library)', '0 (laminin 1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/*genetics/immunology', 'Laminin/immunology', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', '*Peptide Library']",2005/02/26 09:00,2005/03/22 09:00,['2005/02/26 09:00'],"['2005/02/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/22 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/26 09:00 [entrez]']","['33/4/e35 [pii]', '10.1093/nar/gni033 [doi]']",epublish,Nucleic Acids Res. 2005 Feb 24;33(4):e35. doi: 10.1093/nar/gni033.,,,,,PMC549574,,,,,,,,,,,,

This article focuses on the role of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and its receptors in human embryo implantation. LIF is a secreted glycoprotein first described as a factor that induced the differentiation of mouse myeloid leukemic M1 cells into macrophages and later proposed as a marker of the embryo implantation process. An important role for LIF in implantation was shown on LIF knockout mice, when embryo implantation did not occur. In endometrium of healthy women, LIF and LIF mRNA are expressed throughout the menstrual cycle with a striking increase in the midsecretory phase, coinciding with a supposed window of implantation. Correlation in the expression of LIF and some other markers of implantation has been reported. LIF acts on cells by binding to the LIF receptor (LIFR) and gp130. Human blastocysts express mRNAs for LIFR and gp130, participating actively in establishing contact with the endometrium. In the endometrium, LIFR and gp130 are expressed in the endometrial epithelium throughout the cycle with strong increase in the midsecretory phase. Endometrium of infertile women produces significantly less LIF during the period of receptivity. The role of LIF gene mutations in unexplained infertility and implantation failures in IVF patients is not clear yet.

L domains act by recruiting the ESCRT complexes, which normally function in the formation of multivesicular bodies. The PTAP late domain of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is believed to specifically recruit this machinery by binding the ESCRT protein TSG101. It was recently demonstrated that expression of a C-terminal fragment of TSG101 (TSG-3') blocked the budding of both PTAP-dependent and PPPY-dependent retroviruses. We show here that TSG-3' expression leads to the formation of large spherical entities that we call TICS (TSG-3'-induced cellular structures) in the cytoplasm. Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) and murine leukemia virus (MLV) Gag proteins are selectively recruited to these structures, but HIV type 1 Gag is completely excluded. Experiments with various HIV and RSV vector constructs as well as HIV and RSV chimeras suggest that recruitment to the TICS is late domain independent and does not involve recognition of any single amino acid sequence. TICS appear to have no limiting membrane and do not colocalize with markers for any membranous cellular compartment. Wild-type TSG101 is also recruited to TICS, but most other ESCRT proteins are excluded. These structures are similar in nature to aggresomes, colocalize with the aggresome marker GFP-250, and are highly enriched in ubiquitin but in other ways do not fully meet the description of aggresomes. We conclude that the block to retroviral budding by TSG-3' may be the result of its sequestration of Gag, depletion of free TSG101, or depletion of free ubiquitin.","['Johnson, Marc C', 'Spidel, Jared L', 'Ako-Adjei, Danso', 'Wills, John W', 'Vogt, Volker M']","['Johnson MC', 'Spidel JL', 'Ako-Adjei D', 'Wills JW', 'Vogt VM']","['Cornell University, Ithaca, N.Y, USA. mcj7@cornell.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Endosomal Sorting Complexes Required for Transport)', '0 (Gag protein p12, moloney murine leukemia virus)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tsg101 protein)', '0 (Ubiquitin)', '0 (gag protein p19, Rous sarcoma virus)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Avian Sarcoma Viruses/genetics/*growth & development/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chickens', 'Cytoplasmic Structures/*metabolism/ultrastructure', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Endosomal Sorting Complexes Required for Transport', 'Gene Products, gag/*metabolism', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'HIV-1/genetics', 'Macromolecular Substances/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Transcription Factors/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Transfection', 'Ubiquitin/analysis']",2005/02/26 09:00,2005/04/06 09:00,['2005/02/26 09:00'],"['2005/02/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/06 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/26 09:00 [entrez]']","['79/6/3775 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.79.6.3775-3786.2005 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2005 Mar;79(6):3775-86. doi: 10.1128/JVI.79.6.3775-3786.2005.,,,,"['CA47482/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA047482/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA047482/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA020081/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA20081/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC1075695,,,,,,,,,,,,

Artificial antigen-presenting cells (aAPCs) offer the advantage of being readily available in sufficient numbers, thus allowing for a highly standardized in vitro induction of CTLs. We generated aAPCs coated with anti-CD28 antibody (Ab) and either high-density (HD) or low-density (LD) major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules loaded with HA-1(H), a nonapeptide derived from the hematopoiesis-restricted minor histocompatibility antigen HA-1. HD- and LD-aAPCs potently induced HA-1(H)-specific CD8+ CTLs from untouched CD8+ T cells of healthy donors. CTLs were subsequently purified by magnetic-activated cell sorting. HD- as well as LD-aAPC-induced CTLs exerted high HA-1H-specific cytotoxicity, resembled T(c)1 effector memory cells, survived a long time in vitro, and were expanded by a factor varying between 8.2 x 10(4) and 51 x 10(4). The T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoire of HA-1H tetramer-positive CTLs was oligoclonal with a prominent usage of Vbeta6. The TCR repertoire of tetramer-positive CTLs was distinct from and more restricted than that of tetramer-negative cells. These findings indicate that aAPCs are attractive tools for the ex vivo generation of HA-1H-specific CTLs suitable for immunotherapy of relapsed leukemia.","['Schilbach, Karin', 'Kerst, Gunter', 'Walter, Steffen', 'Eyrich, Matthias', 'Wernet, Dorothee', 'Handgretinger, Rupert', 'Xie, Weidong', 'Rammensee, Hans-Georg', 'Muller, Ingo', 'Buhring, Hans-Jorg', 'Niethammer, Dietrich']","['Schilbach K', 'Kerst G', 'Walter S', 'Eyrich M', 'Wernet D', 'Handgretinger R', 'Xie W', 'Rammensee HG', 'Muller I', 'Buhring HJ', 'Niethammer D']","[""University Children's Hospital Tubingen, Hoppe-Seyler-Str 1, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany. knschilb@med.unituebingen.de""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20050224,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (HA-1 antigen)', '0 (Minor Histocompatibility Antigens)', '0 (Oligopeptides)']",IM,"['Adoptive Transfer/*methods', 'Antigen-Presenting Cells/immunology/*transplantation', 'B-Lymphocytes/cytology', 'Blood Donors', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology/transplantation', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Memory/immunology', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Male', 'Minor Histocompatibility Antigens/*immunology', 'Oligopeptides/*immunology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*immunology/*therapy', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology/transplantation']",2005/02/26 09:00,2005/08/02 09:00,['2005/02/26 09:00'],"['2005/02/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/02 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/26 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)53336-3 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2004-07-2940 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2005 Jul 1;106(1):144-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2004-07-2940.

In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), it is known that the malignant cells secrete VEGF and possess VEGF receptors. This suggests that an autocrine loop might be important in the pathogenesis of CLL. Here we show that, in patients with lymphadenopathy, autocrine VEGF and alpha(4)beta(1) integrin are involved in the chemokine-dependent motility of CLL cells on and through endothelium-processes important for the invasion of lymphoreticular tissues, a major determinant of disease outcome. In contrast, normal lymphocytes were not dependent on autocrine VEGF or alpha(4)beta(1) for either type of cell movement. Moreover, in contrast to normal B lymphocytes, CLL cells failed to cluster and activate alpha(L)beta(2) in response to chemokines, unless VEGF receptor(s) and alpha(4)beta(1) were also engaged by their respective ligands. This is the first demonstration that autocrine VEGF is involved in CLL-cell motility, and that the alpha(L)beta(2) on the malignant cells is functionally altered compared with that of normal B cells in not undergoing activation in response to chemokine alone. Given the importance of cell motility for tissue invasion, the present results provide a rationale for a trial of VEGF and alpha(4) blockade in patients with CLL who have tissue disease.","['Till, Kathleen J', 'Spiller, David G', 'Harris, Robert J', 'Chen, Haijuan', 'Zuzel, Mirko', 'Cawley, John C']","['Till KJ', 'Spiller DG', 'Harris RJ', 'Chen H', 'Zuzel M', 'Cawley JC']","['Department of Haematology, University of Liverpool, United Kingdom. k.j.till@liv.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20050224,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (CXCL12 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL12)', '0 (Chemokines)', '0 (Chemokines, CXC)', '0 (Cross-Linking Reagents)', '0 (Integrin alpha4beta1)', '0 (Integrins)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/*cytology/immunology', 'Cell Movement', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chemokine CXCL12', 'Chemokines/*metabolism', 'Chemokines, CXC/metabolism', 'Cross-Linking Reagents/pharmacology', 'Endothelium, Vascular/cytology/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Integrin alpha4beta1/*physiology', 'Integrins/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/metabolism/*pathology', 'Ligands', 'Lymphocytes/cytology/metabolism', 'Microscopy, Electron, Transmission', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Umbilical Veins/cytology', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/metabolism/*physiology']",2005/02/26 09:00,2005/07/14 09:00,['2005/02/26 09:00'],"['2005/02/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/14 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/26 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)53418-6 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2004-10-4054 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2005 Jun 15;105(12):4813-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2004-10-4054.

Lack of HLA ligand for donor-inhibitory KIR (missing KIR ligand) had no effect on disease-free survival (DFS), overall survival (OS), or relapse in patients receiving transplants for CML and ALL.

Acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALL) often display a high degree of resistance, the mechanisms of which have not been elucidated. METHODS: We used the well-characterized NK cell line NK-92 as a model to investigate whether mechanisms commonly implicated in tumor escape from NK cell killing are relevant for ALL. RESULTS: We demonstrate selective resistance of B-precursor ALL to NK-92 cytotoxicity even in the absence of inhibitory killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR), except for KIR2DL4. We also show that human leukocyte antigen-G, a ligand of KIR2DL4, expressed on a subset of ALL, does not mediate resistance of NK-cell mediated lysis. Similarly, intracellular adhesion molecule/lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 interaction did not contribute significantly to resistance. In contrast the NK-sensitive T-ALL (MOLT-4) expressed moderate amounts of MHC class I chain-related gene AB (MICA/B) a ligand for the NK cell activating receptor NKG2D, while expression of MICA/B was absent in resistant B-ALL cell lines. CONCLUSIONS: The NK cell-resistance of B-lineage ALLs does not appear to involve inhibitory mechanisms, but suggests deficient NK cell activation. Thus, immunostrategies designed to enhance ALL sensitivity toward NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity should focus on mechanisms of NK cell activation.","['Romanski, Annette', 'Bug, Gesine', 'Becker, Sven', 'Kampfmann, Manuela', 'Seifried, Erhard', 'Hoelzer, Dieter', 'Ottmann, Oliver G', 'Tonn, Torsten']","['Romanski A', 'Bug G', 'Becker S', 'Kampfmann M', 'Seifried E', 'Hoelzer D', 'Ottmann OG', 'Tonn T']","['Center for Internal Medicine, Department of Hematology/Oncology, Johann Wolfgang Goethe University, Frankfurt/Main, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (KIR2DL4 protein, human)', '0 (KLRK1 protein, human)', '0 (Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1)', '0 (MHC class I-related chain A)', '0 (MICB antigen)', '0 (NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily K)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, KIR)', '0 (Receptors, KIR2DL4)', '0 (Receptors, Natural Killer Cell)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/immunology', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/immunology', 'Humans', '*Immunity, Cellular', '*Immunity, Innate', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1/immunology', 'NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily K', 'Receptors, Immunologic/immunology', 'Receptors, KIR', 'Receptors, KIR2DL4', 'Receptors, Natural Killer Cell', '*Tumor Escape']",2005/02/26 09:00,2005/05/12 09:00,['2005/02/26 09:00'],"['2004/07/02 00:00 [received]', '2004/11/10 00:00 [revised]', '2004/11/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/02/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/05/12 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/26 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-472X(04)00408-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2004.11.006 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2005 Mar;33(3):344-52. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2004.11.006.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It was shown to induce differentiation and apoptosis in leukemia cells. Resveratrol was also identified as an inhibitor of ribonucleotide reductase (RR), a key enzyme of DNA synthesis. We report about the biochemical effects of resveratrol on the concentration of deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs), the products of RR, and on the incorporation of 14C-labeled cytidine into the DNA of HL-60 human promyelocytic leukemia cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Incorporation of 14C-labeled cytidine into the DNA of resveratrol-treated HL-60 cells was measured. Concentration of dNTPs was determined by a HPLC method. Cytotoxic effects of resveratrol, Ara-C, and tiazofurin were analyzed using growth inhibition and clonogenic assays. Induction of apoptosis was studied using a Hoechst/propidium iodide staining method. RESULTS: We found that resveratrol effectively inhibited incorporation of 14C-labeled cytidine into DNA. Furthermore, incubation of HL-60 cells with resveratrol significantly decreased intracellular dCTP, dTTP, dATP, and dGTP concentrations. Based on these results, we investigated the combination effects of resveratrol with Ara-C or tiazofurin, both antimetabolites, which are known to exhibit synergistic effects in combination with other inhibitors of RR. In growth inhibition, apoptosis, and clonogenic assays, resveratrol acted synergistically with both Ara-C and tiazofurin in HL-60 cells. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that resveratrol could become a viable candidate as one compound in the combination chemotherapy of leukemia and therefore deserves further testing.","['Horvath, Zsuzsanna', 'Saiko, Philipp', 'Illmer, Christoph', 'Madlener, Sibylle', 'Hoechtl, Thomas', 'Bauer, Wolfgang', 'Erker, Thomas', 'Jaeger, Walter', 'Fritzer-Szekeres, Monika', 'Szekeres, Thomas']","['Horvath Z', 'Saiko P', 'Illmer C', 'Madlener S', 'Hoechtl T', 'Bauer W', 'Erker T', 'Jaeger W', 'Fritzer-Szekeres M', 'Szekeres T']","['Clinical Institute of Medical and Chemical Laboratory Diagnostics, General Hospital of Vienna, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Deoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Stilbenes)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '49717AWG6K (Ribavirin)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 1.17.4.- (Ribonucleotide Reductases)', 'Q369O8926L (Resveratrol)', 'ULJ82834RE (tiazofurin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology', 'DNA/biosynthesis', 'Deoxyribonucleotides/metabolism', 'Drug Synergism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy', 'Resveratrol', 'Ribavirin/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Ribonucleotide Reductases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Stilbenes/pharmacology']",2005/02/26 09:00,2005/05/12 09:00,['2005/02/26 09:00'],"['2004/08/03 00:00 [received]', '2004/11/10 00:00 [revised]', '2004/11/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/02/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/05/12 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/26 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-472X(04)00411-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2004.11.009 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2005 Mar;33(3):329-35. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2004.11.009.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Translation of these preclinical findings to a novel treatment strategy required four separate issues to be determined: (1) if a CD40-ALL vaccine could be generated for clinical use; (2) whether clinical translation could be achieved; (3) whether the vaccination was safe; and (4) whether a window of time could be identified that would optimize the efficacy of vaccination. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Nine patients with relapsed/refractory ALL were enrolled in a phase I trial of vaccination with autologous CD40-ALL. Immunologic reconstitution was measured in a separate cohort of 23 patients with newly diagnosed ALL. RESULTS: We successfully prepared autologous vaccines for all nine patients in the phase I trial. CD40-ALL were potent APC, capable of stimulating allogeneic and peptide-specific T cells in vitro. Two patients were vaccinated without adverse events. Five patients died or progressed before vaccination, suggesting that rapid disease progression limits vaccination in patients with relapse disease, thus limiting clinical translation. We therefore sought to identify a window of time for vaccination during which this approach might be feasible. To achieve this end, we evaluated immunological reconstitution in newly diagnosed patients with ALL patients. Despite recovery of myelopoiesis, most patients had profound defects in T, B, and natural killer (NK) cell numbers that failed to recover at any point during therapy. CONCLUSION: Autologous tumor vaccination at a time of ALL relapse is not feasible. Alternative strategies for immunotherapy of ALL may require ex vivo generation of antigen specific T cells and adoptive therapy.","['Haining, W Nicholas', 'Cardoso, Angelo A', 'Keczkemethy, Heather L', 'Fleming, Mark', 'Neuberg, Donna', 'DeAngelo, Daniel J', 'Stone, Richard M', 'Galinsky, Ilene', 'Silverman, Lewis B', 'Sallan, Stephen E', 'Nadler, Lee M', 'Guinan, Eva C']","['Haining WN', 'Cardoso AA', 'Keczkemethy HL', 'Fleming M', 'Neuberg D', 'DeAngelo DJ', 'Stone RM', 'Galinsky I', 'Silverman LB', 'Sallan SE', 'Nadler LM', 'Guinan EC']","['Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02115, USA. nicholas_haining@dfci.harvard.edu']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (CD40 Antigens)', '0 (Cancer Vaccines)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antigen-Presenting Cells/immunology', 'CD40 Antigens/immunology', 'Cancer Vaccines/immunology/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/immunology/*therapy', 'Secondary Prevention', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/transplantation', 'Time Factors']",2005/02/26 09:00,2005/05/12 09:00,['2005/02/26 09:00'],"['2004/08/17 00:00 [received]', '2004/10/31 00:00 [revised]', '2004/12/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/02/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/05/12 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/26 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-472X(04)00441-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2004.12.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2005 Mar;33(3):286-94. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2004.12.001.,,,,"['K08HL72750/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01CA68484/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Template sequence for siRNA was designed, synthesized and inserted into an expression vector pSilencer1.0-U6. Restriction analysis and sequencing were performed to verify the pBCR6 vector. Then pBCR6 was transfected into K562 cells by X-tremeGene Q2. pSilencer1.0-U6 was used as the control. At different time point after transfection, apoptosis rate was determined by Tunel and Annexin V+ PI with FCM. RESULT: pBCR6 was verified by restriction analysis and sequencing. The apoptosis rate of K562 cells markedly increased at 48 and 72 hour after transfected with pBCR6, and increased in a time-dependent manner [the apoptosis rate of transfected K562 cells was (47.80 +/- 1.63)% at 72 hrs, whereas the control group was (6.67 +/- 0.37)%, P < 0.0001] No prominent change in apoptosis rate was found in the control.

The assays are based on the comparison of patient and control expression profiles. Expression profile of the control sample should be representative but there is a problem of inter-individual variability in population, because also healthy persons display differences in gene transcription activity. Aim of the study was to characterize expression profiles of controls and to determine variability rate. METHODS AND RESULTS: The control group comprised 15 ""healthy"" persons (9 peripheral bloods, 2 bone marrows, 4 cord bloods) from various age categories (0 to 56 years). Expression profiles were detected using Atlas Human Cancer cDNA Expression Arrays (Clontech) with 588 gene probes. Total RNAs were isolated from leukocytes and were reverse transcribed into cDNA. Out of 588 tested genes on average 24% were detected. Inter-individual variability of gene expression profiles of leukocytes from the same tissue did not exceed 25%. Majority of the genes, with significant changes in leukemia patients, was expressed at similar level in the control group, with the exception of bone marrow and cord blood samples that demonstrated higher expression of PCNA, MMP8, MMP9 genes. In bone marrow high PCNA expression could result from active cell proliferation in this tissue. Strong expressions of MMP8 and MMP9 might be associated with the presence of cell precursors because there were not detected in peripheral blood leukocytes. Expression of some genes was tissue specific or followed ""ontogenetic"" trend. CONCLUSIONS: The inter-individual expression variability has to be taken into account in expression comparative analyses. In order to minimize the influence of existing variability we use mixed control samples and statistical data processing.","['Bruchova, H', 'Brdicka, R']","['Bruchova H', 'Brdicka R']","['Ustav hematologie a krevni transfuze, Praha. hana.bruchova@uhkt.cz']",['cze'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,Czech Republic,Cas Lek Cesk,Casopis lekaru ceskych,0004743,,IM,"['Adult', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genetic Variation', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis']",2005/02/26 09:00,2005/03/18 09:00,['2005/02/26 09:00'],"['2005/02/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/18 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/26 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cas Lek Cesk. 2004;143(12):847-9.,,,Inter-individualni variabilita genove exprese sledovana pomoci biocipu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: From the study area 1 207 cancer cases were reported to the National Cancer Registry over the 1985-2000 period. Frequency and relative risks were calculated for the indigenous residents and for the nonindigenous residents of the area. RESULTS: Cancer of the testes and leukemia were the most common cancer types among indigenous men, and cancer of the cervix uteri was the most common among indigenous women. Indigenous men were at significantly lower risk for cancer of the stomach, skin, prostate, and lymph nodes and for leukemia than were nonindigenous men. Indigenous women were at significantly lower risk for cancer of the stomach, skin, breast, cervix uteri, and lymph nodes than were nonindigenous women. CONCLUSION: Our data from the Ecuadorian Amazon indicate the need to develop appropriate mechanisms to register the indigenous population in the national census as well as in the National Cancer Registry. Also needed are cancer early detection programs, more health education efforts, and stronger health services that are adapted to the local conditions.

We previously reported the survivin expression profile in ATL, a CD4-positive T-cell malignancy caused by HTLV-I. HTLV-I Tax is thought to play an important role in immortalization of T cells. We have shown also that the expression of Tax protected the mouse T-cell line CTLL-2 against apoptosis induced by deprivation of IL-2 and converted its growth from being IL-2 dependent to being IL-2 independent through the NF-kappaB pathway. In our study, we demonstrate that constitutive expression of survivin was associated with resistance to apoptosis after IL-2 deprivation in Tax-expressing CTLL-2 cells. Transient transfection assays showed that survivin promoter was transactivated by Tax, via the activation of NF-kappaB. Pharmacological NF-kappaB inhibition resulted in suppression of survivin expression and caused apoptosis of Tax-expressing CTLL-2 cells. Our findings suggest that activated NF-kappaB signaling contributes directly to malignant progression of ATL by preventing apoptosis, acting through the prosurvival protein survivin.","['Kawakami, Hirochika', 'Tomita, Mariko', 'Matsuda, Takehiro', 'Ohta, Takao', 'Tanaka, Yuetsu', 'Fujii, Masahiro', 'Hatano, Masahiko', 'Tokuhisa, Takeshi', 'Mori, Naoki']","['Kawakami H', 'Tomita M', 'Matsuda T', 'Ohta T', 'Tanaka Y', 'Fujii M', 'Hatano M', 'Tokuhisa T', 'Mori N']","['Division of Molecular Virology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, University of the Ryukyus, Nishihara, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (BIRC5 protein, human)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Survivin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Base Sequence', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Gene Products, tax/*pharmacology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins', 'Interleukin-2/metabolism', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/*metabolism', 'NF-kappa B/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Signal Transduction', 'Survivin', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2005/02/25 09:00,2005/07/22 09:00,['2005/02/25 09:00'],"['2005/02/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/22 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/25 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.20954 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2005 Jul 20;115(6):967-74. doi: 10.1002/ijc.20954.,,,,,,,,,"['Copyright 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,

Treatment with pharmacological doses of recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (rh-G-CSF) stimulates neutrophil production and decreases the risk of major infectious complications. However, approximately 15% of CN patients develop myeloid malignancies that have been associated with somatic mutations in the G-CSF receptor (G-CSFR) and RAS genes as well as with acquired monosomy 7. We report a CN patient with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) who never received rh-G-CSF. Molecular analysis demonstrated a somatic G-CSFR mutation (C2390T), which led to expression of a truncated G-CSFR protein in the CMML. Normal G-CSFR expression was unexpectedly absent in primary and cultured CMML. In addition, CMML cells showed monosomy 7 and an oncogenic NRAS mutation. In vitro culture revealed a G-CSF-dependent proliferation of CMML cells, which subsequently differentiated along the monocytic/macrophage lineage. Our results provide direct evidence for the in vivo expression of a truncated G-CSFR in leukemic cells, which emerged in the absence of rh-G-CSF treatment and transduces proliferative signals.","['Germeshausen, M', 'Schulze, H', 'Kratz, C', 'Wilkens, L', 'Repp, R', 'Shannon, K', 'Welte, K', 'Ballmaier, M']","['Germeshausen M', 'Schulze H', 'Kratz C', 'Wilkens L', 'Repp R', 'Shannon K', 'Welte K', 'Ballmaier M']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Hannover Medical School, Germany.

We have previously demonstrated that the expression of TEL/ARG in Ba/F3 cells results in prolonged viability and hyper-responsiveness to IL-3. To determine the molecular mechanisms, a series of mutants of TEL/ARG were generated, and each cDNA was expressed in Ba/F3 or CHO cells. The PNT domain in TEL and K317 in ARG were essential for both signaling and biological effects. The SH3 domain in ARG was required for hyper-responsiveness to IL-3, but not for prolonged viability. The opposite was true for the SH2 domain in ARG. Mutation of Y314 in TEL, a putative GRB2-binding site, led to reduced viability, and loss of hyper-responsiveness to IL-3. All biological functions were profoundly impaired with deletion of the C-terminus in ARG, despite maintaining high levels of its kinase activity. When expressed in CHO cells, wild-type TEL/ARG induced the formation of fillopodia, in a fashion dependent on the C-terminal portion and intact kinase activity. Thus, these results suggest several critical domains within TEL/ARG necessary for function, and indicate that the signaling pathways necessary for viability, growth factor hyper-responsiveness and cytoskeletal reorganization are likely to be separate.","['Okuda, K', 'Oda, A', 'Sato, Y', 'Nakayama, A', 'Fujita, H', 'Sonoda, Y', 'Griffin, J D']","['Okuda K', 'Oda A', 'Sato Y', 'Nakayama A', 'Fujita H', 'Sonoda Y', 'Griffin JD']","['Department of Health Sciences and Preventive Medicine, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, Kyoto, Japan. keiko_o@koto.kpu-m.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (GRB2 Adaptor Protein)', '0 (GRB2 protein, human)', '0 (Integrin beta1)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (TEL-ARG fusion protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'N12000U13O (Doxycycline)']",IM,"['Actin Cytoskeleton/metabolism', 'Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/pharmacology', 'CHO Cells', 'Cell Movement/physiology', 'Cricetinae', 'Doxycycline/pharmacology', 'GRB2 Adaptor Protein', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/physiology', 'Humans', 'Integrin beta1/genetics', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Leukemia/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mutagenesis', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'src Homology Domains/physiology']",2005/02/25 09:00,2005/05/27 09:00,['2005/02/25 09:00'],"['2005/02/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/05/27 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['2403668 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2403668 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2005 Apr;19(4):603-10. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403668.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A cohort of 189 consecutive, adult patients with neutropenia hospitalized in the hemato-oncology ward of the University hospital Berne between 1995 and 1999 were included in a retrospective study to assess risk factors for IA. In total, 45 IA cases (nine proven, three probable, 33 possible), 11 patients with refractory fever and 133 controls were analyzed. IA cases had more often acute leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) (88 vs 38%, P < 0.001) and a longer duration of neutropenia (mean 20.6 vs 9.9 days, P < 0.001). They also had fewer neutropenic episodes during the preceding 6 months (mean 0.42 vs 1.03, P < 0.001), that is, confirmed (82%) and probable (73%) IA occurred most often during the induction cycle. A short time interval ( < or = 14 days) between neutropenic episodes increased the risk of IA four-fold (P = 0.06). Bacteremia, however, was not related to the number of preceding neutropenic episodes. Therefore, neutropenic patients with leukemia or MDS have the highest risk of IA.

They interact with corepressors, such as N-CoR and SMRT, that recruit a multiprotein complex containing histone deacetylases on crucial myeloid differentiation genes. This leads to gene repression contributing to generate a differentiation block. We expressed in leukemia cells containing PML/RARalpha and AML1/ETO N-CoR protein fragments derived from fusion protein/corepressor interaction surfaces. This blocks N-CoR/SMRT binding by these fusion proteins, and disrupts the repressor protein complex. In consequence, the expression of genes repressed by these fusion proteins increases and differentiation response to vitamin D3 and retinoic acid is restored in previously resistant cells. The alteration of PML/RARalpha-N-CoR/SMRT connections triggers proteasomal degradation of the fusion protein. The N-CoR fragments are biologically effective also when directly transduced by virtue of a protein transduction domain. Our data indicate that fusion protein activity is permanently required to maintain the leukemia phenotype and show the route to developing a novel therapeutic approach for leukemia, based on its molecular pathogenesis.","['Racanicchi, Serena', 'Maccherani, Chiara', 'Liberatore, Concetta', 'Billi, Monia', 'Gelmetti, Vania', 'Panigada, Maddalena', 'Rizzo, Giovanni', 'Nervi, Clara', 'Grignani, Francesco']","['Racanicchi S', 'Maccherani C', 'Liberatore C', 'Billi M', 'Gelmetti V', 'Panigada M', 'Rizzo G', 'Nervi C', 'Grignani F']","['Patologia Generale and Medicina Interna e Scienze Oncologiche, Dipartimento di Medicina Clinica e Sperimentale, Perugia University, Policlinico Monteluce, Perugia, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20050224,England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,"['0 (AML1-ETO fusion protein, human)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (NCOR1 protein, human)', '0 (NCOR2 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Receptor Co-Repressor 1)', '0 (Nuclear Receptor Co-Repressor 2)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '1C6V77QF41 (Cholecalciferol)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cholecalciferol/pharmacology', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Receptor Co-Repressor 1', 'Nuclear Receptor Co-Repressor 2', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/*metabolism', 'Peptides/genetics/physiology', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary/genetics/physiology', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Repressor Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology']",2005/02/25 09:00,2005/06/09 09:00,['2005/02/25 09:00'],"['2004/06/30 00:00 [received]', '2005/02/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/02/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/09 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['7600593 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.emboj.7600593 [doi]']",ppublish,EMBO J. 2005 Mar 23;24(6):1232-42. doi: 10.1038/sj.emboj.7600593.

Activation of the Ser/Thr kinase IRAK-1 is an important event in several inflammatory processes. By contrast, another IRAK family member, IRAK-M, negatively regulates this pathway, and is up-regulated in cultures of endotoxin-tolerant monocytes and in monocytes from septic patients within the timeframe of tolerance. In this study, we show that IRAK-M expression is enhanced at the mRNA and protein level in human monocytes cultured in the presence of tumor cells. IRAK-M was induced in monocytes upon coculturing with different tumor cells, as well as by fixed tumor cells and medium supplemented with the supernatant from tumor cell cultures. Moreover, blood monocytes from patients with chronic myeloid leukemia and patients with metastasis also overexpressed IRAK-M. Low concentrations of hyaluronan, a cell surface glycosaminoglycan released by tumor cells, also up-regulated IRAK-M. The induction of IRAK-M by hyaluronan and tumor cells was abolished by incubation with anti-CD44 or anti-TLR4 blocking Abs. Furthermore, down-regulation of IRAK-M expression by small interfering RNAs specific for IRAK-M reinstates both TNF-alpha mRNA expression and protein production in human monocytes re-exposed to a tumor cell line. Altogether, our findings indicate that deactivation of human monocytes in the presence of tumor cells involves IRAK-M up-regulation, and this effect appears to be mediated by hyaluronan through the engagement of CD44 and TLR4.","['del Fresno, Carlos', 'Otero, Karel', 'Gomez-Garcia, Lourdes', 'Gonzalez-Leon, Maria Carmen', 'Soler-Ranger, Llanos', 'Fuentes-Prior, Pablo', 'Escoll, Pedro', 'Baos, Rosa', 'Caveda, Luis', 'Garcia, Felipe', 'Arnalich, Francisco', 'Lopez-Collazo, Eduardo']","['del Fresno C', 'Otero K', 'Gomez-Garcia L', 'Gonzalez-Leon MC', 'Soler-Ranger L', 'Fuentes-Prior P', 'Escoll P', 'Baos R', 'Caveda L', 'Garcia F', 'Arnalich F', 'Lopez-Collazo E']","['Research Unit, Department of Surgical Research, La Paz Hospital, Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antibodies, Blocking)', '0 (Hyaluronan Receptors)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-1)', '0 (TLR4 protein, human)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 4)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptors)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '9004-61-9 (Hyaluronic Acid)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (IRAK3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Interleukin-1 Receptor-Associated Kinases)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antibodies, Blocking/pharmacology', 'Cell Communication/immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Down-Regulation/immunology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/immunology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Hyaluronan Receptors/immunology/*physiology', 'Hyaluronic Acid/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-1 Receptor-Associated Kinases', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Macrophage Activation/immunology', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/antagonists & inhibitors/immunology/*physiology', 'Middle Aged', 'Monocytes/*immunology/*metabolism', 'Protein Kinases/*biosynthesis/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/antagonists & inhibitors/immunology/*physiology', 'Receptors, Interleukin-1/*biosynthesis', 'Toll-Like Receptor 4', 'Toll-Like Receptors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Up-Regulation/*immunology']",2005/02/25 09:00,2005/04/20 09:00,['2005/02/25 09:00'],"['2005/02/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/20 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['174/5/3032 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.174.5.3032 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2005 Mar 1;174(5):3032-40. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.174.5.3032.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For the purpose of immunotherapy with DC, it is important to investigate the phagocytosis of killed tumor cells by different DC subsets. Using immature monocyte-derived DC (iMoDC) as reference, we have compared the ability of CD11c+ DC and PDC to phagocytose apoptotic and necrotic K562 leukemia cells. Freshly isolated CD11c+ DC phagocytosed apoptotic and necrotic K562 cells, whereas PDC did not show any evidence of uptake of dead cells. Blocking studies showed that CD36 is importantly involved in uptake of apoptotic and necrotic material. CD91 and CD11c were also involved. In addition, we found that beta5 integrin was expressed on CD11c+ DC but not in its classical association with alphaV. Uptake of apoptotic K562 cells by CD11c+ DC was increased following incubation with granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and interleukin (IL)-4, alone or in combination with transforming growth factor-beta1, to levels comparable with those observed for iMoDC. Phagocytosis of dead cellular material by the GM-CSF/IL-4-treated CD11c+ DC was largely restricted to a subset expressing low levels of human leukocyte antigen-DR and CD83. Thus, the relationship between phagocytosis of antigenic material and expression of maturation-related cell-surface molecules is similar for CD11c+ DC and MoDC. We conclude that CD11c+ DC in peripheral blood are precursor cells, which under the influence of cytokines, differentiate to cells with DC phenotype and function.","['Dalgaard, Jakob', 'Beckstrom, Karen J', 'Jahnsen, Frode L', 'Brinchmann, Jan E']","['Dalgaard J', 'Beckstrom KJ', 'Jahnsen FL', 'Brinchmann JE']","['Institute of Immunology, Rikshospitalet University Hospital, Sognsvannsveien 20, N-0027 Oslo, Norway. jakob.dalgaard@labmed.uio.no']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20050222,United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,"['0 (CD11c Antigen)', '0 (Culture Media, Serum-Free)', '0 (Integrin beta Chains)', '0 (TGFB1 protein, human)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta1)', '0 (integrin beta5)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*immunology', 'CD11c Antigen/*immunology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/immunology', 'Culture Media, Serum-Free', 'Dendritic Cells/cytology/drug effects/*immunology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Integrin beta Chains/immunology', 'Interleukin-4/pharmacology', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/pathology', 'Monocytes/cytology/drug effects/immunology', 'Necrosis/immunology', 'Phagocytosis/drug effects/*immunology', 'Plasma Cells/cytology/drug effects/*immunology', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/pharmacology', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta1']",2005/02/25 09:00,2005/07/13 09:00,['2005/02/25 09:00'],"['2005/02/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['jlb.1204711 [pii]', '10.1189/jlb.1204711 [doi]']",ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 2005 May;77(5):689-98. doi: 10.1189/jlb.1204711.

Pre-TCR-expressing cells are selected to survive and differentiate further, whereas pre-TCR(-) cells are ""negatively"" selected to die.

Here, we describe the induction of the antiapoptotic gene BCL2A1 (A1) as a potential mechanism regulating inhibition of pre-T cell death. We characterize in detail the signaling pathway involved in A1 induction and show that A1 expression can induce pre-T cell survival by inhibiting activation of caspase-3. Moreover, we show that in vitro ""knockdown"" of A1 expression can compromise survival even in the presence of a functional pre-TCR.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with relapsed or refractory acute leukemias or MDS, or previously untreated but poor candidates for chemotherapy, were included in this phase I study with a 3 + 3 dose escalation design. BMS-214662 was administered as a 1-hour bolus once weekly at doses of 42 to 157 mg/m2. Once the MTD was identified, the schedule was changed to a 24-hour continuous infusion once weekly (starting dose, 300 mg/m2). RESULTS: Thirty patients were treated at a dose of 42 (n = 1), 56 (n = 3), 84 (n = 3), 118 (n = 13), 157 (n = 6) or 300 mg/m2 (n = 4). DLT occurred in 3 patients at 157 mg/m2, including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, hypokalemia and cardiovascular problems. No DLT occurred with 24-hour continuous infusion. MTD with a 1-hour infusion was 118 mg/m2, with no MTD identified with the 24-hour infusion. Plasma concentrations of BMS-214662 correlated with the dose. Inhibition of FTase activity of approximately 60% occurred after the infusion with recovery to near baseline after 24 hours. Five patients had evidence of antileukemia activity, including two with complete remission with incomplete platelet recovery, one with hematologic improvement, and two with morphologic leukemia-free state. CONCLUSION: BMS-214662 is well tolerated at doses of up to 118 mg/m2 as a 1-hour infusion. The toxicity profile and efficacy may be improved with prolonged exposure. Further investigation of this agent in leukemia is warranted.","['Cortes, Jorge', 'Faderl, Stefan', 'Estey, Elihu', 'Kurzrock, Razelle', 'Thomas, Deborah', 'Beran, Miloslav', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Ferrajoli, Alessandra', 'Giles, Francis', 'Koller, Charles', ""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Wright, John', 'Bai, Stephen A', 'Kantarjian, Hagop']","['Cortes J', 'Faderl S', 'Estey E', 'Kurzrock R', 'Thomas D', 'Beran M', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Ferrajoli A', 'Giles F', 'Koller C', ""O'Brien S"", 'Wright J', 'Bai SA', 'Kantarjian H']","['The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Department of Leukemia, 1515 Holcombe Blvd, Unit 428, Houston, TX 77030, USA. jcortes@mdanderson.org']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20050222,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Imidazoles)', '12794-10-4 (Benzodiazepines)', 'L2U9GFD244', '(7-cyano-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1-(1H-imidazol-4-ylmethyl)-3-(phenylmethyl)-4-(2-thie', 'nylsulfonyl)-1H-1,4-benzodiazepine)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Benzodiazepines/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Maximum Tolerated Dose', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/pathology']",2005/02/25 09:00,2005/05/20 09:00,['2005/02/25 09:00'],"['2005/02/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/05/20 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['JCO.2005.09.005 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2005.09.005 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2005 Apr 20;23(12):2805-12. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2005.09.005.

We have now investigated activation of downstream BCR signaling pathways in U-CLL and M-CLL B cells using soluble anti-IgM (sol-IgM) and immobilized anti-IgM (imm-IgM) antibodies as models for antigenic stimulation. Ligation of the BCR with sol-IgM induced incomplete responses in both CLL subsets, resembling the pattern described for tolerant B cells. This response was characterized by transient phosphorylation of extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) and Akt (protein kinase B [PKB]), lack of activation of c-JUN NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and variable activation of phospholipase Cgamma2 (PLCgamma2) and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB). Stimulation with imm-IgM elicited a more complete BCR signal and significantly prolonged phosphorylation of ERK and Akt, indicating persistent or repetitive BCR signaling. Moreover, this type of stimulation increased the levels of the antiapoptotic protein myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1) and protected from chemotherapy-induced apoptosis, whereas induction of apoptosis and down-regulation of Mcl-1 was observed following stimulation with sol-IgM. These data demonstrate that only sustained BCR signaling can promote survival of CLL B cells and indicate that the main difference between CLL with mutated and unmutated V(H) genes may reside in the availability of such stimulation.","['Petlickovski, Aleksandar', 'Laurenti, Luca', 'Li, Xiaoping', 'Marietti, Sara', 'Chiusolo, Patrizia', 'Sica, Simona', 'Leone, Giuseppe', 'Efremov, Dimitar G']","['Petlickovski A', 'Laurenti L', 'Li X', 'Marietti S', 'Chiusolo P', 'Sica S', 'Leone G', 'Efremov DG']","['International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology Outstation - Monterotondo, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20050222,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (AKT1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 4)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'B-Lymphocytes/*cytology/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival', 'Down-Regulation', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/metabolism', 'Immunoglobulin M/chemistry', 'Immunophenotyping', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*metabolism', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/cytology', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 4', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases/metabolism', 'Models, Biological', 'Mutation', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Time Factors']",2005/02/25 09:00,2005/07/14 09:00,['2005/02/25 09:00'],"['2005/02/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/14 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)53419-8 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2004-07-2669 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2005 Jun 15;105(12):4820-7. doi: 10.1182/blood-2004-07-2669.

We investigated the compatibility of the Jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus (JSRV) envelope glycoprotein with the feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) vector. A construct consisting of the minimal JSRV env coding region expressed from a standard mammalian expression plasmid generated FIV vector titers of approximately 10(4) TU/ml following standard triple transfection, collection of supernatants, and concentration by centrifuge. Interestingly, retention of the native proviral 5' and 3' flanking regions surrounding the JSRV env resulted in exceptional titers of approximately 10(8) TU/ml following the same viral preparation. To discern the regions necessary to achieve this 10,000-fold increase in titer, additional constructs were designed and tested. Our results indicate that the enhanced vector titer correlates with an increase in steady-state levels of envelope RNA that results from a combination of RNA splicing and stability, leading to increased envelope protein production. Expression of four other glycoproteins in an expression plasmid retaining the enhancing elements from the JSRV proviral sequence increased FIV vector titers from 0- to 100-fold. These novel data demonstrate that optimization of the envelope expression construct can profoundly influence titers for lentivirus vectors.","['Sinn, Patrick L', 'Burnight, Erin R', 'Shen, Hong', 'Fan, Hung', 'McCray, Paul B Jr']","['Sinn PL', 'Burnight ER', 'Shen H', 'Fan H', 'McCray PB Jr']","['Department of Pediatrics, Program in Gene Therapy, Carver College of Medicine, The University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA 52242, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Mol Ther,Molecular therapy : the journal of the American Society of Gene Therapy,100890581,['0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)'],IM,"['Animals', '*Genetic Vectors/genetics', 'Jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus/*genetics', '*Lentivirus/genetics', '*Leukemia Virus, Feline/genetics', 'Proviruses/genetics', 'Rats', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/genetics']",2005/02/25 09:00,2005/07/26 09:00,['2005/02/25 09:00'],"['2004/04/14 00:00 [received]', '2004/10/11 00:00 [revised]', '2004/10/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/02/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/26 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1525-0016(04)01566-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ymthe.2004.10.022 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Ther. 2005 Mar;11(3):460-9. doi: 10.1016/j.ymthe.2004.10.022.,,,,"['HL-51670/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-67623/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 DK-54759/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL-61460/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Glioblastoma multiforme is a highly malignant primary brain tumor that is usually treated with surgery and/or radiotherapy. Previous studies implicate an autocrine loop caused by high expression of PDGF and its receptor, PDGFR, in the proliferation of some glioblastomas. Here, we demonstrate that pretreatment of a human glioblastoma cell line, RuSi RS1, with imatinib significantly enhanced the cytotoxic effect of ionizing radiation. This effect was not seen in human breast cancer (BT20) and colon cancer (WiDr) cell lines. Whereas c-Abl and c-Kit were expressed about equally in the three cell lines, RuSi RS1 cells showed significantly higher expression of PDGFR-beta protein in comparison to BT20 and WiDr. Imatinib treatment of RuSi RS1 cells decreased overall levels of cellular tyrosine phosphorylation and specifically inhibited phosphorylation of PDGFR-beta, while c-Abl was not prominently activated in these cells. These results suggest that imatinib may have clinical utility as a radiosensitizer in the treatment of human glioblastoma, possibly through disruption of an autocrine PDGF/PDGFR loop.","['Holdhoff, Matthias', 'Kreuzer, Karl-Anton', 'Appelt, Christine', 'Scholz, Regina', 'Na, Il-Kang', 'Hildebrandt, Bert', 'Riess, Hanno', 'Jordan, Andreas', 'Schmidt, Christian A', 'Van Etten, Richard A', 'Dorken, Bernd', 'le Coutre, Philipp']","['Holdhoff M', 'Kreuzer KA', 'Appelt C', 'Scholz R', 'Na IK', 'Hildebrandt B', 'Riess H', 'Jordan A', 'Schmidt CA', 'Van Etten RA', 'Dorken B', 'le Coutre P']","['Medizinische Klinik fur Hamatologie und Onkologie, Campus Virchow, Charite, Humboldt Universitat, Augustenburger Platz 1, 13353 Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Blood Cells Mol Dis,"Blood cells, molecules & diseases",9509932,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Radiation-Sensitizing Agents)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptors, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor)']",IM,"['Benzamides', 'Breast Neoplasms', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/radiation effects', 'Colonic Neoplasms', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Female', 'Glioblastoma', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Radiation-Sensitizing Agents/*pharmacology', 'Receptors, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor/*antagonists & inhibitors']",2005/02/25 09:00,2005/09/30 09:00,['2005/02/25 09:00'],"['2004/11/28 00:00 [received]', '2005/02/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/30 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1079-9796(04)00236-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bcmd.2004.11.006 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Cells Mol Dis. 2005 Mar-Apr;34(2):181-5. doi: 10.1016/j.bcmd.2004.11.006.,,,,['CA90576/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

The transfected GM979 cells rapidly (within 1 month) evolved into a stable population which expresses constant levels of reporters for more than a year of continuous bulk culture. No silencing of the inserted construct was observed over time. In contrast, after 1 month, the reporter activity (both from (A)gamma- and beta-promoter) expressed per cell increased over time. The analysis of the Luciferase contained in single cell clones indicated that the higher reporter activity was due to increased gene expression per cell rather than to clonal selection of the most expressing clones. Since the activity driven by the beta-promoter increased 10-fold more than that driven by the (A)gamma one, the ratio between (A)gamma-driven/((A)gamma-driven + beta-driven) reporter activity in the cells decreased after 1 month and became similar to the gamma/(gamma + beta) globin mRNA ratio expressed by adult erythroid cells. Moreover, although both cells from early and late bulk culture responded to incubation with butyric acid, a known inducer of fetal globin gene expression, by increasing the reporter activity driven by the (A)gamma-promoter, only cells from late bulk culture decreased, as normal primary erythroblasts do, the activity of the reporter driven by the beta-promoter. These results suggest that the rapid changes in activity driven by the (A)gamma- and beta-globin promoters occurring during the first month after transfection may represent a novel in vitro model to study epigenetic regulation of the (A)gamma- and beta-promoter during the fetal to adult hemoglobin switch and confirm GM979 cells stably transfected with the dual reporter construct as a reliable assay for automated screening of chemical inducers of fetal globin gene activation.","['Migliaccio, Giovanni', 'Di Baldassarre, Angela', 'Di Rico, Cristina', 'Di Noia, Antonella', 'Nakamoto, Betty', 'Cao, Hua', 'Skarpidi, Eva', 'Migliaccio, Anna Rita']","['Migliaccio G', 'Di Baldassarre A', 'Di Rico C', 'Di Noia A', 'Nakamoto B', 'Cao H', 'Skarpidi E', 'Migliaccio AR']","['Gene and Cell Therapy, Department of Cell Biology and Neuroscience, Istituto Superiore di Sanita, Viale Regina Elena 299, I-00161 Rome, Italy. migliagi@iss.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Blood Cells Mol Dis,"Blood cells, molecules & diseases",9509932,"['9004-22-2 (Globins)', '9034-63-3 (Fetal Hemoglobin)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Fetal Hemoglobin/genetics', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Globins/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Luciferases/genetics', 'Mice', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Transfection']",2005/02/25 09:00,2005/09/30 09:00,['2005/02/25 09:00'],"['2004/07/28 00:00 [received]', '2004/11/21 00:00 [revised]', '2005/02/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/30 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1079-9796(04)00235-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bcmd.2004.11.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Cells Mol Dis. 2005 Mar-Apr;34(2):174-80. doi: 10.1016/j.bcmd.2004.11.005.,,,,"['E.1172/Telethon/Italy', 'HL20899/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our case suggests phenotypical and functional heterogeneity of tumour cells in ATL, which may be closely related to the clinical appearance of the skin eruption.","['Shimauchi, T', 'Hirokawa, Y', 'Tokura, Y']","['Shimauchi T', 'Hirokawa Y', 'Tokura Y']","['Department of Dermatology, School of Medicine, University of Occupational and Environmental Health, Japan, 1-1 Iseigaoka, Yahatanishi-ku, Kitakyusyu 807-8555, Japan. t-shima@med.uoeh-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,England,Br J Dermatol,The British journal of dermatology,0004041,"['0 (CCR4 protein, human)', '0 (CD4 Antigens)', '0 (CD8 Antigens)', '0 (Receptors, CCR4)', '0 (Receptors, Chemokine)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (GZMB protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Granzymes)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Serine Endopeptidases)']",IM,"['Aged', 'CD4 Antigens/analysis', 'CD8 Antigens/analysis', 'Female', 'Granzymes', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*immunology/pathology', 'Leukemic Infiltration/immunology', 'Purpura/*immunology/pathology', 'Receptors, CCR4', 'Receptors, Chemokine/*metabolism', 'Serine Endopeptidases/*metabolism', 'Skin/pathology', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/*immunology']",2005/02/25 09:00,2005/06/14 09:00,['2005/02/25 09:00'],"['2005/02/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/14 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['BJD6281 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2133.2004.06281.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Dermatol. 2005 Feb;152(2):350-2. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2133.2004.06281.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, WHI-07 was antimitotic, leading to cell fusion and developmental arrest in the Zebrafish model of rapid cell proliferation. WHI-07 was cytotoxic to drug-sensitive (NALM-6, MOLT-3, HL-60, P388) and multi-drug resistant (MDR) leukemia cell lines (HL-60/VCR, HL-60/ADR, P388/ ADR). Treatment of leukemia cells with WHI-07 showed rapid and dramatic depletion of all cellular nucleoside diphosphate and triphosphate (NDP/NTP) pools, which would contribute to the overall reduction of nucleic acid synthesis and cell death. WHI-07 was rapidly metabolized to alaninyl ZDV monophosphate (Ala-ZDV-MP), the levels of which inversely correlated with cytotoxic IC50 values of WHI-07. Glutathione was found to mediate the in vitro and in vivo detoxification pathway of WHI-07 to 3'-azidothymidine-5'-p-bromophenylmethoxyalaninyl phosphate and Ala-ZDV-MP, respectively. The proposed intracellular metabolic pathway for WHI-07 involves a thiol-mediated dehalogenation step followed by the paraoxon-sensitive carboxylesterase-mediated reaction leading to the formation of Ala-ZDV-MP as the major intracellular metabolite.","['Uckun, Fatih M', 'Tai, Hung-Liang', ""D'Cruz, Osmond J""]","['Uckun FM', 'Tai HL', ""D'Cruz OJ""]","['Drug Discovery Program, Departments of Virology, Parker Hughes Institute, St Paul, Minnesota 55113, USA. faith_uckun@ih.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,Germany,Arzneimittelforschung,Arzneimittel-Forschung,0372660,"[""0 (5-bromo-6-methoxy-5, 6-dihydro-3'-azidothymidine-5'-(p-bromophenyl)"", 'methoxyalaninyl phosphate)', '0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Cholinesterase Inhibitors)', '0 (Dideoxynucleotides)', '0 (Nucleosides)', '0 (Tetrazolium Salts)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '1N3CZ14C5O (Rhodamine 123)', '365-07-1 (Thymidine Monophosphate)', '4B9XT59T7S (Zidovudine)', 'EC 3.1.1.- (Carboxylic Ester Hydrolases)', 'EUY85H477I (thiazolyl blue)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'Q9CX8P80JW (Paraoxon)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Biotransformation', 'Carboxylic Ester Hydrolases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cholinesterase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Dideoxynucleotides', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Embryo, Nonmammalian', 'Glutathione/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Nucleosides/metabolism', 'Paraoxon/pharmacology', 'Rhodamine 123/metabolism', 'Subcellular Fractions', 'Tetrazolium Salts', 'Thiazoles', 'Thymidine Monophosphate/*analogs & derivatives/*metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay', 'Zebrafish', 'Zidovudine/*analogs & derivatives/*metabolism/*pharmacology']",2005/02/25 09:00,2005/03/17 09:00,['2005/02/25 09:00'],"['2005/02/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/17 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/25 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1055/s-0031-1296824 [doi]'],ppublish,Arzneimittelforschung. 2005;55(1):50-65. doi: 10.1055/s-0031-1296824.,,,,"['HD37357/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'HD42884/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although anti-ND antibodies are nonpathogenic, the mechanisms that lead to this unique reactivity are critical to understanding the loss of immune tolerance in PBC. Importantly, Sp100 and PML are both covalently linked to small ubiquitin-related modifiers (SUMOs). Therefore, we investigated whether SUMO proteins are independent autoantigens in PBC and studied 99 PBC sera samples for reactivity against NDs, PML, and Sp100, as well as against SUMO-2 and SUMO-1 recombinant proteins. Autoantibodies against SUMO-2 and SUMO-1 were found in 42% and 15% of anti-ND-positive PBC sera, respectively. Anti-SUMO reactivity was not observed in anti-ND-negative sera. Anti-SUMO-2 autoantibodies were found in 58% of sera containing autoantibodies against both PML and Sp100 and were detected exclusively in sera containing anti-Sp100 autoantibodies. In conclusion, SUMO proteins constitute a novel and independent class of autoantigens in PBC. Furthermore, we believe our data emphasize the post-translational modification of lysine by either lipoylation in the case of AMA or SUMOylation in the case of specific anti-ND autoantibodies as the pivotal site for autoantibody generation in PBC.","['Janka, Caroline', 'Selmi, Carlo', 'Gershwin, M Eric', 'Will, Hans', 'Sternsdorf, Thomas']","['Janka C', 'Selmi C', 'Gershwin ME', 'Will H', 'Sternsdorf T']","['Heinrich-Pette-Institut fur experimentelle Virologie und Immunologie and the Universitat Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Hepatology,"Hepatology (Baltimore, Md.)",8302946,"['0 (Antibodies, Antinuclear)', '0 (Antigens, Nuclear)', '0 (Autoantibodies)', '0 (Autoantigens)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (SUMO-1 Protein)', '0 (SUMO2 protein, human)', '0 (Small Ubiquitin-Related Modifier Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '135844-47-2 (Sp100 protein, human)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Antinuclear/blood', 'Antigens, Nuclear/immunology', 'Autoantibodies/blood', 'Autoantigens/*immunology', 'Chickens', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Liver Cirrhosis, Biliary/*immunology', 'Mitochondria/immunology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/immunology', 'Nuclear Proteins/immunology', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'SUMO-1 Protein/chemistry/*immunology', 'Small Ubiquitin-Related Modifier Proteins/chemistry/*immunology', 'Transcription Factors/immunology', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",2005/02/24 09:00,2005/03/18 09:00,['2005/02/24 09:00'],"['2005/02/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/18 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/24 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/hep.20619 [doi]'],ppublish,Hepatology. 2005 Mar;41(3):609-16. doi: 10.1002/hep.20619.,,,,"['DK39588/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK92310/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

IMF belongs to the Philadelphia chromosome negative chronic myeloproliferative disorders (Ph(-) CMPD). Megakaryocytes and platelets have been suggested as the major cellular source of TGF beta-1 in IMF. The osteoclastogenesis inhibitory factor osteoprotegerin (OPG) seems to be regulated by TGF beta-1 and substantial involvement of OPG expression in the process of osteosclerosis in IMF has recently been suggested. In order to determine TGF beta-1 expression in IMF and other Ph(-) CMPD, total bone marrow cells as well as laser-microdissected megakaryocytes were quantitatively analysed by real-time RT-PCR. OPG mRNA expression in fibrotic IMF was correlated with TGF beta-1 mRNA expression in a case-specific manner. Both OPG and TGF beta-1 were detected immunohistochemically in order to delineate cellular origin. When total bone marrow cells were investigated, TGF beta-1 mRNA expression was increased in some but not all cases of IMF (n = 21), with highest values in fibrotic cases. Unexpectedly, increased values were also observed in essential thrombocythaemia (ET, n = 11) when compared to non-neoplastic haematopoiesis (n = 38). Megakaryocytes isolated by laser microdissection displayed elevated TGF beta-1 mRNA levels in most of the CMPD samples with no significant differences discernible between fibrotic IMF, polycythaemia vera (PV) and ET. TGF beta-1 protein was predominantly expressed by the myeloid lineage in Ph(-) CMPD and non-neoplastic haematopoiesis, which, however, displayed lower expression. IMF cases with advanced fibrosis concomitantly overexpressed TGF beta-1 and OPG. Immunohistochemically, OPG expression was found in different stromal cells and a subfraction of megakaryocytes. In conclusion, enhanced TGF beta-1 expression occurs in megakaryocytes as well as myeloid cells in Ph(-) CMPD. TGF beta-1 may be necessary, but is not sufficient, to induce bone marrow fibrosis in IMF because non-fibrotic Ph(-) CMPD entities share this feature with IMF and cannot be discriminated from each other on the basis of TGF beta-1 expression.","['Bock, Oliver', 'Loch, Gero', 'Schade, Ulrika', 'von Wasielewski, Reinhard', 'Schlue, Jerome', 'Kreipe, Hans']","['Bock O', 'Loch G', 'Schade U', 'von Wasielewski R', 'Schlue J', 'Kreipe H']","['Institute of Pathology, Medizinische Hochschule Hannover, 30625 Hannover, Germany.

Cytogenetics and patient age at the time of diagnosis are two major factors determining treatment outcome in AML. Patients with poor-risk cytogenetics have much lower complete remission rates than other groups. In addition, AML in patients greater than 55 to 60 years of age often exhibits a resistant phenotype, more akin to secondary AML or AML arising from myelodysplastic syndromes. This group is also characterized by lower complete remission rates, and often requires the delivery of intensive therapy to a patient population that is the least likely to tolerate it. At the Jefferson Health System (Philadelphia, PA), we wished to develop a regimen that was maximally intensive to treat stubborn disease, but gentle enough to be given to all patients regardless of age. Toward this end, 33 patients received a maximal dose of the cytoprotective agent, amifostine, before each infusion of idarubicin in the ""7 + 3"" regimen, escalating the dose of idarubicin in a phase I fashion to a maximum dose of 24 mg/m2 .

The detailed mechanisms are not clearly understood. We decided to attempt to gain further insight into the mechanisms underlying vaticanol C-induced apoptosis in HL-60 cells. Treatment of HL-60 cells with vaticanol C was found to cause a marked decrease in the level of phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) concurrent with inhibited phosphorylation of its upstream kinase mitogen-activates protein kinase kinase (MEK). Moreover, exposure to vaticanol C led to a significant reduction in the level of phosphorylated Akt. Thus, vaticanol C induced inhibition of both ERK and Akt phosphorylation, resulting in reduced phosphorylation of Bad. These results suggest that vaticanol C might induce apoptosis via a mechanism involving activation of Bad through disruption of pro-survival signaling pathways.","['Ohguchi, Kenji', 'Akao, Yukihiro', 'Matsumoto, Kenji', 'Tanaka, Toshiyuki', 'Ito, Tetsuro', 'Iinuma, Munekazu', 'Nozawa, Yoshinori']","['Ohguchi K', 'Akao Y', 'Matsumoto K', 'Tanaka T', 'Ito T', 'Iinuma M', 'Nozawa Y']","['Gifu International Institute of Biotechnology, Kakamigahara, Gifu, Japan. kohguchi@giib.or.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Biosci Biotechnol Biochem,"Bioscience, biotechnology, and biochemistry",9205717,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Stilbenes)', '0 (vaticanol C)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/drug effects', 'Stilbenes/*pharmacology']",2005/02/24 09:00,2005/07/20 09:00,['2005/02/24 09:00'],"['2005/02/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/20 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['JST.JSTAGE/bbb/69.353 [pii]', '10.1271/bbb.69.353 [doi]']",ppublish,Biosci Biotechnol Biochem. 2005 Feb;69(2):353-6. doi: 10.1271/bbb.69.353.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Administration of these bivalent scFvs significantly prolonged the survival of mice transplanted with KPMM2 human myeloma cells. Because bivalent scFvs induced neither ADCC nor CDC, such antitumor activity by bivalent scFv is presumably attributable to cell death caused by the ligation of CD47.

On the basis of a screening analysis for KIT mutations, two patients with a kinase mutation and one with extracellular juxtamembrane mutation, in first or subsequent leukemic relapse, received 400mg Imatinib twice daily for 30 days. After Imatinib discontinuation, bone marrow cells were re-tested to assess the KIT mutational status and the chromosomal set. In our experience, none of the treated patients had a response by standard criteria; in particular, we did not observe any activity against acute myeloid leukemia (AML) associated with KIT kinase mutations. However, in the patient with extracellular juxtamembrane mutation, Imatinib seems to have some clinical beneficial effect and, most important, is able to abrogate the leukemic subclone carrying the mutation. Whether Imatinib, in combination with other agents, may play a role in the treatment of AML with more sensitive extracellular juxtamembrane KIT mutation remains to be determined.","['Cairoli, Roberto', 'Beghini, Alessandro', 'Morello, Enrico', 'Grillo, Giovanni', 'Montillo, Marco', 'Larizza, Lidia', 'Morra, Enrica']","['Cairoli R', 'Beghini A', 'Morello E', 'Grillo G', 'Montillo M', 'Larizza L', 'Morra E']","['Division of Haematology, Niguarda Hospital, Piazza Ospedale Maggiore 3, 20162 Milan, Italy. ctm_marencairoli@ospedaleniguarda.it']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20050112,England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Core Binding Factors)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Bone Marrow Cells/drug effects/pathology', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Core Binding Factors', 'DNA Primers', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/*genetics', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics']",2005/02/24 09:00,2005/04/22 09:00,['2005/02/24 09:00'],"['2004/07/14 00:00 [received]', '2004/10/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/02/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/22 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0145-2126(04)00369-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2004.10.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2005 Apr;29(4):397-400. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2004.10.005.

We have studied 101 cases of CLL treated with fludarabine over a 10-year period (1990-2000) and observed a 12% incidence of transformation. In six of 12 patients, transformation was documented within 4 months following treatment with fludarabine. Pathological material, available in nine cases, was investigated for latent EBV by staining for LMP-1 by immunohistochemistry and EBERs-1 and 2 by in situ hybridisation. LMP-1 and EBERs were demonstrated in three of the nine samples. In two cases there was a different pattern of immunoglobulin gene rearrangement in the transformed cells assessed by PCR (FR3 fragment) compared to the original CLL clone. One of these two cases showed evidence of latent EBV. The other seven cases, of which two were EBV positive, showed identical pattern of Ig gene rearrangement in both the CLL and the transformed cells. We suggest that the relatively high incidence of transformation in this series may be due to immunosuppression mainly related to fludarabine, although other agents and prior therapies may have also contributed.","['Thornton, P D', 'Bellas, C', 'Santon, A', 'Shah, G', 'Pocock, C', 'Wotherspoon, A C', 'Matutes, E', 'Catovsky, D']","['Thornton PD', 'Bellas C', 'Santon A', 'Shah G', 'Pocock C', 'Wotherspoon AC', 'Matutes E', 'Catovsky D']","['Section of Haemato-Oncology, Institute of Cancer Research, The Royal Marsden Hospital, Fulham Road, London SW3 6JJ, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/*isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Kidney/pathology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/pathology/*virology', 'Lymph Nodes/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Reed-Sternberg Cells/parasitology', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics', 'Vidarabine/*analogs & derivatives/*therapeutic use']",2005/02/24 09:00,2005/04/22 09:00,['2005/02/24 09:00'],"['2004/07/15 00:00 [received]', '2004/09/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/02/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/22 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0145-2126(04)00312-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2004.09.008 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2005 Apr;29(4):389-95. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2004.09.008.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Shortest peptide giving positive seroreactivity was octapeptide P8 (p21 env 418-425). Competitive Western blot assay with use of fusion peptides revealed that the minimal HTLV-I epitope responsible for seroreactivity found in patients with T-LGL leukemia is a decapeptide PP10 (p21 env 417-426).

In this study we provide evidence that increased expression of osteopontin may also be associated with progression of Bcr-Abl-expressing leukaemia cells. The Bcr-Abl fusion protein, generated by the Philadelphia translocation, is the hallmark of chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML). CML exhibits clinically distinct phases. Advanced disease shows defective differentiation, bone marrow infiltration and drug resistance. The critical signalling mediating this disease progression is unknown. Increased aggressiveness of the disease has been correlated with elevated amounts of Bcr-Abl. We generated a 32D cell line model to study the consequences of different expression levels of Bcr-Abl. Osteopontin was identified by microarray analysis as highly upregulated in cells expressing elevated amounts of Bcr-Abl. Moreover, in high Bcr-Abl expressing cells, an additional 50 kDa isoform of osteopontin was detected.

We demonstrated that secretion of osteopontin resulted in enhanced degradation of I kappa B, the inhibitor of NF-kappa B.

We therefore performed a prospective, multi-centre study focused on children with MDS (n = 65; advanced MDS = 44, refractory cytopenia = 21) after allo-SCT in order to determine to what extent relapse can be prevented by pre-emptive immunotherapy on the basis of increasing MC. Analyses of chimaerism in 44 patients with advanced MDS revealed 31 cases with complete chimaerism (CC)/low-level MC/transient MC, 11 cases with increasing MC and two cases with decreasing MC. The same analyses in 21 MDS patients with refractory cytopenia revealed 17 cases with CC/low-level MC, one case with increasing MC and three cases with decreasing MC. Pre-emptive immunotherapy performed on each patient that showed increasing MC improved event-free survival from 0%, as seen in prior studies, to 50%.

AIM: The aim of this study was to evaluate the experience with this protocol, the treatment results according to the risk groups and to compare the Hungarian data with the international results. METHODS: Patients were stratified into 3 risk groups, based on initial white blood cell count, age, immunology, cytogenetics and response to treatment: standard, medium and high risk group. RESULTS: Three hundred sixty eight children entered the study (male-female ratio was 1.27:1, median age 6 years and 4 months). 110 (29.9%) children were in the standard, 210 (57.1%) in the medium and 48 (13%) in the high risk group. Duration of the chemotherapy was 2 years, except of the boys in the standard risk group, their maintenance therapy was 1 year longer. The overall complete remission rate was 93.2%. 20 (5.4%) children died in induction and 5 (1.4%) were non-responders. The 5-year overall survival for all patients was 78.5%, in the standard risk group 93.2%, in the medium risk group 78.4% and in the high risk group 44.5% with a minimum follow up of 1.19 years and median follow up of 4.85 years. From the 368 patients 272 (73.9%) are still in their first complete clinical remission and other 18 children are alive after relapse. In 14.7% of the patients relapse was diagnosed; the most common site was the bone marrow. In one patient second malignancy occurred. The 5-year event free survival for all patients was 72.6%, in the standard risk group 87.6%, in the medium risk group 72.1% and in the high risk group 39.9%. CONCLUSION: The treatment outcome of children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia improved remarkably over the last decades. 78% of children suffering from acute lymphoblastic leukemia could be cured with the ALL-BFM-95 protocol. The Hungarian results are comparable to those achieved by other leukaemia study groups in the world regarding the ALL-BFM-95 protocol.","['Muller, Judit', 'Kovacs, Gabor', 'Jakab, Zsuzsanna', 'Renyi, Imre', 'Galantai, Ilona', 'Bekesi, Andrea', 'Kiss, Csongor', 'Nagy, Kalman', 'Kajtar, Pal', 'Bartyik, Katalin', 'Masat, Peter', 'Magyarosy, Edina']","['Muller J', 'Kovacs G', 'Jakab Z', 'Renyi I', 'Galantai I', 'Bekesi A', 'Kiss C', 'Nagy K', 'Kajtar P', 'Bartyik K', 'Masat P', 'Magyarosy E']","['Semmelweis Egyetem, Altalanos Orvostudomanyi Kar, II.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Examination and treatment results were analysed for patients with atypical myeloid leukemia (n = 4), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS, n = 1) and thrombocytosis, MDS and eosinophilia (n = 1). The examination included morphological, histological, cytogenetic and molecular tests. RESULTS: One patient with atypical chronic myeloid leukemia was prior diagnosed to have primarily MDS with a typical aberration of chromosome 5. Two other patients had an initial morphological picture of resistant anemia with blast excess, signs of myeloproliferation and extramedullary hemopoiesis. One and two months after the first examination they received transfusions of erythrocytic mass. Just then they were found to have splenomegaly and leukocytosis due to proliferating and maturating forms of neutrophils. The course of the disease in patients with MDS, thrombocytosis and normal karyotype and in patients with MDS, eosinophilia and combined chromosomal breaks including translocation (3;12)(q21;p13) was characterized by resistance to standard programs of polychemotherapy and transformation into acute myeloblastic leukemia. CONCLUSION: In some cases atypical CML is a stage of a natural course of MDS. Some MDS variants with eosinophilia and thrombocytosis should be referred to the group of mixed myeloid neoplasias.","['Gritsaev, S V', 'Abldulkadyrov, K M', 'Tiranova, S A', 'Kapustin, S I', 'Martynkevich, I S', ""Bessmel'tsev, S S"", ""Rugal', V I"", 'Bakai, M P']","['Gritsaev SV', 'Abldulkadyrov KM', 'Tiranova SA', 'Kapustin SI', 'Martynkevich IS', ""Bessmel'tsev SS"", ""Rugal' VI"", 'Bakai MP']",,['rus'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,Russia (Federation),Ter Arkh,Terapevticheskii arkhiv,2984818R,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 12', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 3', 'Eosinophilia/classification/complications/*physiopathology', 'Female', 'Hematopoiesis, Extramedullary', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/classification/complications/*physiopathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/classification/complications/*physiopathology', 'Thrombocytosis/classification/complications/*physiopathology', 'Translocation, Genetic']",2005/02/24 09:00,2005/09/02 09:00,['2005/02/24 09:00'],"['2005/02/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/02 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/24 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Ter Arkh. 2004;76(12):68-73.,,,Kliniko-biologicheskie osobennosti smeshannykh mieloidnykh zabolevanii.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By quantitative PCR, ABCC10 gene expression is demonstrated to be highest in pancreas among the adult and fetal tissues and tumors presently tested. Decreased expression was observed when resting T- and B-cells were activated. Furthermore, when we examined its expression under apoptotic conditions, we found that ABCC10 mRNA levels remarkably increased in doxorubicin-treated MCF7 cells, whereas its up-regulation was suppressed in p53-dominant-negative MCF7 cells.

This suggests that CDK-targeting may be an effective therapeutic approach for T-ALL and other cancers. In this study, we tested 3 inhibitors of CDK4, 3-aminothioacridone (3-ATA), thioacridone (TA), and oxindole, for their effects on DNA synthesis and viability in primary T-ALL. Each compound was an effective inhibitor, with overall IC(50)s in similar ranges. In colony formation assay, leukemic cells were approximately 10-fold more sensitive to 3-ATA than normal bone marrow cells. When sorted by G1 protein status of T-ALL, p16(+), p15(+) or pRb(-) samples were significantly less sensitive to 3-ATA and TA, but not to oxindole, than p16(-), p15(-) or pRb(+) samples. There was no relationship of sensitivity with ARF expression. Despite their in vitro function as inhibitors of CDK4, 3-ATA did not inhibit pRb phosphorylation or cause G1 arrest, but did cause DNA damage and result in the induction and phosphorylation of p53.

Abnormalities in sequence of Lamin B Receptor(LBR) gene results in a lack of LBR protein that is essential for chromatin-binding to nuclear membrane. In neutrophils lacking LBR protein shows abnormal bilobular or monolobular nuclear forms and hyper-condensed chromatin-aggregation. We re-analyzed distribution of such Pelger-Huet anomaly in other cell lineages; we found that not only neutrophils but erythroblasts, monocytes, lymphocytes, plasma cells, eosinophils and basophils are also carrying chromatin-hypercondensation. One third of megakaryocytes are also binucleated like neutrophils. We compared neutrophil morphology between familial Pelger-Huet anomaly and so called pseudo-Pelger-Huet anomaly observed in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes(MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia(AML). The neutrophils in MDS were much similar to those of the familial anomaly, but neutrophils of AML, such as t (8;21) M2-AML and t (15;17) M3-AML, showed more heterogeneous pattern in lobulation and chromatin-hypercondensation. Especially in M3, differentiation-induction by all-trans retinoic acid induced a marked neutrophilia with pseudo-Pelger-Huet anomaly without chromatin-hypercondensation. Lack of LBR protein in familial Pelger-Huet anomaly results in hypolobulation and chromatin-hypercondensation in neutrophils, but in other cells such as erythroblasts and lymphocytes only chromatin-hypercondensation can be observed. In contrast pseudo-Pelger-Huet anomaly are more heterogeneous in morphology compared to the familial anomaly. The lack of leukemic or MDS transformation in the familial anomaly is a sharp contrast to the neoplastic nature of the pseudo-Pelger-Huet anomaly. In conclusion, our morphological recognition of certain abnormality of cells shows an marked progression when genetic abnormality responsible for some of them are discovered, and often make us recognize a further heterogeneity in them. We, hematologists and technicians, must be well prepared to report our own observation of an un-explained morphological abnormality.","['Tomonaga, Masao']",['Tomonaga M'],"['Department of Hematology, Molecular Medicine Unit, Atomic Bomb Disease Institute, Nagasaki University School of Medicine, Nagasaki 852-8523.']",['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",,Japan,Rinsho Byori,Rinsho byori.

Activation of telomerase and stabilization of telomeres are considered necessary for immortalization of tumor cells. Chronic Myeloid Leukaemia (CML) is a good example to investigate the reactivation of telomerase as; after a variable period in chronic phase, CML undergoes further evolution. The aim of this work is to study telomerase activity in patients with philadelphia- positive CML and to compare the relative amount of telomerase activity between chronic phase, accelerated phase and blastic crisis. The study is conducted on 3 groups. Group I comprised ten newly diagnosed CML patients in chronic phase; five males and five females their ages ranged from 24-63 years (X = 44.1 +/- 11.2 years). Group II comprised ten patients in acute transformation (accelerated or blastic crisis phase); seven were males and three were females their ages ranged from 14 to 63 years ( X = 35.7 +/- 16.2 years). Ten healthy subjects comprised the control group III; five males and five females their ages ranged from 14-50 years ( X = 31.8 +/- 12.4 years). All patients were subjected to thorough history taking and clinical examination, complete blood picture with differential cell counts, bone marrow aspiration and/or biopsy, neutrophil alkaline phosphatase scoring by cytochemistry, immunophenotyping to identify the type of blast crisis, chromosomal analysis to detect Ph-positive cases, and measurement of telomerase activity by PCR-ELISA technique. Telomerase activity was highest in acute transformation with a range of (0.252-1.896) and mean of 1.521 0.496, while in chronic phase ranged between 0.67 and 0.743 with a mean of 0.305 +/- 0.109 and in normal controls the range was 0.45 to 0.195 with a mean of 0.102 +/- 0.048. The difference between groups was statistically significant. No correlation was found between the activity of the telomerase and hemoglobin, platelet, leucocyte counts, percentage of peripheral blood, bone marrow blasts, basophils, bone marrow cellularity, the type of crisis as well as leucocyte alkaline phosphatase scoring. In conclusion; The increased level of telomerase activity as noticed in the different stages of CML indicates its association with disease progression and can be used as a useful marker for evaluating development of the course.","['Rasoul, Naglaa Abdel', 'Elhalawani, Nabil', 'Nafae, Mohammed Hassan A', 'Elkaffash, Dalal M', 'Mourad, Zeinab I']","['Rasoul NA', 'Elhalawani N', 'Nafae MH', 'Elkaffash DM', 'Mourad ZI']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Alexandria University, Alexandria, Egypt.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Egypt,Egypt J Immunol,The Egyptian journal of immunology,9816016,"['EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)', 'EC 3.1.3.1 (Alkaline Phosphatase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Alkaline Phosphatase/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Cells/enzymology/immunology', 'Disease Progression', 'Egypt', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*enzymology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutrophils/enzymology/immunology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Telomerase/genetics/*metabolism']",2005/02/24 09:00,2005/04/27 09:00,['2005/02/24 09:00'],"['2005/02/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/27 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/24 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Egypt J Immunol. 2004;11(1):1-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast, exposure to short-lived antigen only temporarily suppressed IL-7Ralpha expression, failed to induce T cell exhaustion, and primed T cells.

The mechanism by which Bim isoforms are held in an inactive form remains poorly documented in normal B cells. In the current study, we demonstrated that in normal tonsil B cells the three major Bim isoforms are strongly associated with the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members Mcl-1, Bcl-2 and Bcl-x(L). On the other hand, only a weak association of BimEL and L with the dynein LC8 chain has been found. In addition, there is no free Bim in normal B cells. Moreover, subcellular fractionation demonstrated that Bim and the anti-apoptotic counterparts are localized preferentially in the mitochondria-rich fraction. The fact that most Bim was found in this fraction supports the hypothesis that it is sequestered by anti-apoptotic molecules in mitochondria where its pro-apoptotic activity is controlled. Of interest, BimS is essentially complexed to Mcl-1 and the Mcl-1/Bim complex is the most abundant among the three types of complexes. This supports the idea that this complex is critical for the control of B cell death. In conclusion, these results favor a model in which Bim release from anti-apoptotic proteins is a critical event for initiation of apoptosis.","['Gomez-Bougie, Patricia', 'Bataille, Regis', 'Amiot, Martine']","['Gomez-Bougie P', 'Bataille R', 'Amiot M']","['INSERM, UMR601, Departement de Recherche en Cancerologie, Equipe 5 labelisee L N C, Institut de Biologie, Nantes, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Germany,Eur J Immunol,European journal of immunology,1273201,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (BCL2L11 protein, human)', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/physiology', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology/*metabolism', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11', 'Carrier Proteins/immunology/*metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Membrane Proteins/immunology/*metabolism', 'Mitochondria/immunology/*metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/immunology/*metabolism', 'Palatine Tonsil/cytology', 'Protein Isoforms/immunology/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/immunology/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/immunology/*metabolism', 'bcl-X Protein']",2005/02/23 09:00,2005/04/20 09:00,['2005/02/23 09:00'],"['2005/02/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/20 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/23 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/eji.200425878 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Immunol. 2005 Mar;35(3):971-6. doi: 10.1002/eji.200425878.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Fifty consecutive patients (median age at testing 6.6 years, range 4-12) were included in a prospective, longitudinal, nationwide study. Treatment would include intrathecal and systemic chemotherapy according to the DCLSG ALL-9 protocol. Children were evaluated with an extensive neuropsychological battery including measures of intelligence, memory, attention, language, visual-constructive function, and fine-motor abilities within two weeks after start of the chemotherapy. The control group consisted of 29 healthy siblings (median age at testing 8.2 years, range 4-12), who were tested <4 weeks after the patients' assessment. RESULTS: Mean scores on Wechsler Intelligence Scales did not differ significantly between patients and siblings; mean IQ scores for both the patients and the controls were high average. To examine specific neuropsychological functions, norm scores based on the exact age were acquired by fitting procedures, but no significant differences were found. CONCLUSIONS: Neuropsychological assessment of patients during early hospitalisation is feasible. The results indicate no adverse effect of illness and psychological factors on IQ and neuropsychological functioning of patients with recently diagnosed ALL. The prospective design of this study of cognitive late effects of chemotherapy will allow discrimination between adverse sequelae of disease and treatment.","['Jansen, N C', 'Kingma, A', 'Tellegen, P', 'van Dommelen, R I', 'Bouma, A', 'Veerman, A', 'Kamps, W A']","['Jansen NC', 'Kingma A', 'Tellegen P', 'van Dommelen RI', 'Bouma A', 'Veerman A', 'Kamps WA']","['Department of Paediatric Haematology Oncology, Groningen University Hospital, Groningen, Netherlands.

Accordingly, aberrant acetylation and deacetylation resulting from the misregulation of histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and/or histone deacetylases (HDACs) has been linked to clinical disorders such as Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome, fragile X syndrome, leukemia, and various cancers. Of significant import has been the development of small molecule HDAC inhibitors that permit pharmacological manipulation of histone acetylation levels and treatment of some of these diseases including cancer. In this Review we discuss evidence that aberrant HAT and HDAC activity may also be a common underlying mechanism contributing to neurodegeneration during acute and chronic neurological diseases, including stroke, Huntington's disease Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease. With this in mind, a number of studies examining the use of HDAC inhibitors as therapy for restoring histone acetylation and transcriptional activation in in vitro and in vivo neurodegenerative models are discussed.

We have used cDNA microarrays to measure changes in gene expression at 2, 4 and 6 hr after irradiation of Reh and U698 cells with 0.5 and 4 Gy in order to begin exploring the molecular mechanisms underlying the phenotypic changes. We also investigated whether gene expression changes could be caused by possible aberrations of genes, as measured by comparative genomic hybridization. Reh cells showed upregulation of CDKN1A that likely mediated the G1 arrest. In contrast, U698 cells have impaired function of TP53 protein and no activation of CDKN1A, suppressing the arrest in G1. The G2 arrest in both cell lines was likely due to repression of PLK1 and/or CCNF. IR-induced apoptosis in Reh cells was probably mediated by TP53 and CDKN1A, whereas a high expression level of MCL1, caused by gene amplification, and activation of the NFKB pathway may have suppressed the apoptotic response in U698 cells. Genes suggested to be involved in apoptosis were activated long before this phenotype was detectable and showed the same temporal expression profiles as genes involved in cell cycle arrest. Our results suggest that differences in functionality and/or copy number of several genes involved in IR-regulated pathways contributed to the phenotypic differences between Reh and U698 cells after IR, and that multiple molecular factors control the radiation response of malignant B lymphocytes.","['Lyng, Heidi', 'Landsverk, Kirsti S', 'Kristiansen, Elin', 'DeAngelis, Paula M', 'Ree, Anne H', 'Myklebost, Ola', 'Hovig, Eivind', 'Stokke, Trond']","['Lyng H', 'Landsverk KS', 'Kristiansen E', 'DeAngelis PM', 'Ree AH', 'Myklebost O', 'Hovig E', 'Stokke T']","['Department of Radiation Biology, The Norwegian Radium Hospital, Oslo, Norway. heidi.lyng@labmed.uio.no']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,,IM,"['Chromosome Aberrations/radiation effects', 'Gene Expression/*radiation effects', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Radiation, Ionizing', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/radiation effects']",2005/02/22 09:00,2005/07/22 09:00,['2005/02/22 09:00'],"['2005/02/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/22 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/22 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.20962 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2005 Jul 20;115(6):935-42. doi: 10.1002/ijc.20962.,,,,,,,,,"['Copyright 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,

The fusion gene produces a chimeric transcription factor that suppresses the expression of AML1-target genes via the MTG8 part of the chimeric protein, which is thought to be the primary cause of leukemia. The C-terminal region of MTG8 contains the MYND domain, represented by highly conserved zinc-finger-like protein motifs, and is known to interact with corepressor proteins. We found that, instead of the MYND domain, an alternative last exon of MTG8 encoding 27 amino acids in-frame is expressed naturally in human adult testis and in several leukemia cell lines. This type of alternative splicing also occurred in the AML1-MTG8 fusion gene at high levels in leukemia cell lines with t(8;21), as well as in blast cells of leukemia patients with t(8;21). The variant proteins of both MTG8 and AML1-MTG8 reduced transcriptional repressor activity in a mammalian two-hybrid assay. However, mixed expression of these variants with wild-type MTG8 recovered their repressor activity, suggesting that these variants also act as repressors in vivo where wild-type MTG8 and other family members exist in abundance. On the other hand, the MYND-less variants acquired a higher affinity for binding to MTG8 and formed a multimer, whereas the wild-type protein forms a dimer. Thus, expression of the MYND-less variants by the dysregulation of splicing machinery, which stimulates the oligomerization of fusion proteins in leukemia cells, may enhance malignant conversion of hematopoietic cells.","['Kozu, Tomoko', 'Fukuyama, Tomofusa', 'Yamami, Tohru', 'Akagi, Kiwamu', 'Kaneko, Yasuhiko']","['Kozu T', 'Fukuyama T', 'Yamami T', 'Akagi K', 'Kaneko Y']","['Research Institute for Clinical Oncology, Saitama Cancer Center, Ina, Saitama, Japan. kozu@cancer-c.pref.saitama.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (RUNX1T1 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['*Alternative Splicing', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Deletion', 'Genetic Variation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', '*Translocation, Genetic']",2005/02/22 09:00,2005/05/25 09:00,['2005/02/22 09:00'],"['2005/02/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/05/25 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/22 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/gcc.20165 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2005 May;43(1):45-53. doi: 10.1002/gcc.20165.,,,,,,,,,"['Copyright 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,

To assess the variation between detection methods in the interpretation of a submicroscopic gene deletion, we performed an extra signal (ES)-FISH BCR/ABL and double-FISH (D-FISH) BCR/ABL on frozen bone marrow cells from 79 patients with CML (63 in the chronic phase, 6 in the accelerated phase, and 10 in blast crisis) and 30 patients with a BCR/ABL-negative myeloproliferative disorder as determined by RT-PCR. The normal cutoff values were 0.22% for ES-FISH and 0.25% for D-FISH. The cutoff values for false-positive signals from a juxtaposition of the BCR and ABL gene were 11% in ES-FISH and 13% in D-FISH. Of the 14 patients who showed an ABL gene deletion by ES-FISH, 5 had an ABL deletion only, 5 had both a BCR and an ABL deletion, but 4 proved to have a classic BCR/ABL rearrangement without a submicroscopic deletion, as determined by D-FISH. Discrepant results between ES- and D-FISH were observed in 12 of the 79 patients (15.8%), and the main causes of a discrepancy were a false-positive ABL deletion (4 of 12, 33%), a variant Philadelphia chromosome (3 of 12, 25%), an inversion of derivative chromosome 9 at the very breakpoint of the ABL gene (9q32) (1 of 12, 8.3%), a cryptic variant Ph chromosome (1 of 12, 8.3%), and a marker chromosome (1 of 12, 8.3%). Although there was no significant difference in the sensitivity for the detection of the fusion signal between ES- and D-FISH, ES-FISH showed a high percentage of cells with false-positive fusion signals (1 orange, 1 green, 1 yellow), which makes it difficult to interpret the submicroscopic ABL deletion.

Hyperosmotic shock elicits a stress response in mammalian cells, often leading to apoptotic cell death. In a previous report, we showed that hyperosmotic shock induced apoptosis in various mammalian cells. Importantly, apoptotic biochemical changes (i.e., caspase-3 activation and DNA fragmentation) were blocked by antioxidant pretreatment during hyperosmotic shock-induced cell death. In the present study, we report that resveratrol, a phytoalexin present in grapes with known antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, attenuates high glucose-induced apoptotic changes, including c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activation and caspase-3 activation in human leukemia K562 cells. Experiments with the cell permeable dye, 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCF-DA), an indicator of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, revealed that high glucose treatment directly increased intracellular oxidative stress, which was attenuated by resveratrol. In addition, high glucose-treated K562 cells displayed a lower degree of attachment to collagen, the major component of vessel wall subendothelium. In contrast, cells pretreated with resveratrol followed by high glucose exhibited higher affinity for collagen. The results of this report collectively imply the involvement of oxidative stress in high glucose-induced apoptosis and alterations in attachment ability. Moreover, resveratrol blocks these events by virtue of its antioxidant property.","['Chan, Wen-Hsiung']",['Chan WH'],"['Department of Bioscience Technology and Center for Nanotechnology, Chung Yuan Christian University, Chung Li, Taiwan. whchan@cycu.edu.tw']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Stilbenes)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 4)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases)', 'IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)', 'Q369O8926L (Resveratrol)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA Primers', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Glucose/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'K562 Cells', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 4', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases/metabolism', '*Oxidative Stress', 'Reactive Oxygen Species', 'Resveratrol', 'Stilbenes/*pharmacology']",2005/02/22 09:00,2005/10/12 09:00,['2005/02/22 09:00'],"['2005/02/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/10/12 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/22 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcb.20408 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 2005 Apr 15;94(6):1267-79. doi: 10.1002/jcb.20408.,,,,,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,

To investigate if clofarabine could be used with success in biochemical modulation strategies, we investigated the biochemical modulation of cytarabine triphosphate (ara-CTP) by clofarabine in a myeloid leukemia cell line and the effect of this combination on cytotoxicity. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: K562 cells were incubated with clofarabine and ara-C either sequentially or simultaneously to evaluate the combination effect on their phosphorylated metabolites. Clonogenic assays were used to determine the cytotoxicity of each agent alone and in combination. Deoxynucleotide analysis was performed to assess the effect of clofarabine on dNTPs. RESULTS: Clofarabine added either simultaneously or in sequence increased ara-CTP accumulation. The maximal modulation of ara-CTP accumulation occurred with 1 microM clofarabine. This level was achieved at the maximum tolerated dose for adult and pediatric patients with AML. With 10 microM ara-C alone, 86 microM ara-CTP had accumulated after 3 h. The optimal sequence for the drug combination, i.e., clofarabine followed 4 h later by ara-C, resulted in 248 microM ara-CTP at 3 h. Clofarabine accumulated maximally in the monophosphate form. Preincubation with ara-C did not affect the triphosphate form, but it lowered clofarabine monophosphate. Clofarabine resulted in the intracellular decrease of dATP and dGTP levels. Clonogenic assays revealed that the combination of clofarabine and ara-C produced synergistic killing of myeloid leukemia cells. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate that combination of clofarabine followed by ara-C results in a biochemical modulation of ara-CTP and synergistic cell kill. These studies provide a compelling rationale for clinical trials using this combination regimen for adult and pediatric patients with AML.","['Cooper, Todd', 'Ayres, Mary', 'Nowak, Billie', 'Gandhi, Varsha']","['Cooper T', 'Ayres M', 'Nowak B', 'Gandhi V']","['Department of Experimental Therapeutics, University of Texas M.

We also identified Idb4 as a putative tumor-suppressor gene that is methylated in most mouse and human leukemias but in only a minority of other human cancers.","['Yu, Li', 'Liu, Chunhui', 'Vandeusen, Jeff', 'Becknell, Brian', 'Dai, Zunyan', 'Wu, Yue-Zhong', 'Raval, Aparna', 'Liu, Te-Hui', 'Ding, Wei', 'Mao, Charlene', 'Liu, Shujun', 'Smith, Laura T', 'Lee, Stephen', 'Rassenti, Laura', 'Marcucci, Guido', 'Byrd, John', 'Caligiuri, Michael A', 'Plass, Christoph']","['Yu L', 'Liu C', 'Vandeusen J', 'Becknell B', 'Dai Z', 'Wu YZ', 'Raval A', 'Liu TH', 'Ding W', 'Mao C', 'Liu S', 'Smith LT', 'Lee S', 'Rassenti L', 'Marcucci G', 'Byrd J', 'Caligiuri MA', 'Plass C']","['Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio 43210, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",20050220,United States,Nat Genet,Nature genetics,9216904,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Idb4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Inhibitor of Differentiation Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', '*DNA Methylation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', '*Disease Models, Animal', 'Gene Silencing', '*Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Differentiation Proteins', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*genetics', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics']",2005/02/22 09:00,2005/03/29 09:00,['2005/02/22 09:00'],"['2004/08/09 00:00 [received]', '2005/01/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/02/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/29 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['ng1521 [pii]', '10.1038/ng1521 [doi]']",ppublish,Nat Genet. 2005 Mar;37(3):265-74. doi: 10.1038/ng1521.

Due to the cross-linking process, the IgE-binding capacity of the allergens, normally necessary for their characterization, is lost. The aim of this study was to test whether the rat basophilic leukaemia (RBL) cell assay (beta-hexosaminidase release by rat basophils upon allergen stimulation) can be adopted to characterize allergoids and to evaluate the assay for testing allergoids and native allergens as well. METHODS: Mice were immunized with native and modified Phleumpratense extracts in the presence of alum. Their sera were used to sensitize RBL-2H3 cells and measure basophil stimulation induced by different allergen extracts in the presence or absence of various additives. RESULTS: Sera containing specific IgE against both extract formulations were obtained. Native as well as modified extracts induced dose-dependent beta-hexosaminidase release from RBL cells. Both extracts were used to evaluate the characteristics of the assay, which showed high precision. Storage conditions were chosen to enhance extract degradation, which could be read directly from the altered stimulatory capacity of the extracts. Additives turned out to have diverse effects on the assay, whereas phenol had no measurable effect, alum had an inhibitory effect and glycerol elevated basophil activation. CONCLUSIONS: For the first time, a reliable, precise in vitro assay is available that is able to directly measure the properties of modified allergen extracts after their production process. The test is well evaluated and its advantages and limitations are discussed in this report.","['Gehlhar, Kirsten', 'Peters, Marcus', 'Brockmann, Kirsten', 'van Schijndel, Hans', 'Bufe, Albrecht']","['Gehlhar K', 'Peters M', 'Brockmann K', 'van Schijndel H', 'Bufe A']","['Experimental Pneumology, Ruhr University Bochum, Bochum, Germany. kristen.gelhar@ruhr-uni-bochum.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20050217,Switzerland,Int Arch Allergy Immunol,International archives of allergy and immunology,9211652,"['0 (Allergoids)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', 'EC 3.2.1.52 (beta-N-Acetylhexosaminidases)']",IM,"['Allergoids', 'Animals', 'Basophils/*enzymology', '*Biological Assay', 'Female', 'Mice', 'Plant Extracts/*analysis', 'Rats', 'beta-N-Acetylhexosaminidases/*metabolism']",2005/02/22 09:00,2005/05/13 09:00,['2005/02/22 09:00'],"['2004/07/13 00:00 [received]', '2004/11/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/02/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/05/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['83976 [pii]', '10.1159/000083976 [doi]']",ppublish,Int Arch Allergy Immunol. 2005 Apr;136(4):311-9. doi: 10.1159/000083976.

In embryos, alterations of the normal pattern of Hox gene expression result in homeotic transformations and malformations. Disruption of the Hoxa1 gene, the most 3' member of the Hoxa cluster and a retinoic acid (RA) direct target gene, results in abnormal ossification of the skull, hindbrain, and inner ear deficiencies, and neonatal death. We have generated Hoxa1(-/-) embryonic stem (ES) cells (named Hoxa1-15) from Hoxa1(-/-) mutant blastocysts to study the Hoxa1 signaling pathway. We have characterized in detail these Hoxa1(-/-) ES cells by performing microarray analyses, and by this technique we have identified a number of putative Hoxa-1 target genes, including genes involved in bone development (e.g. Col1a1, Postn/Osf2, and the bone sialoprotein gene or BSP), genes that are expressed in the developing brain (e.g. Nnat, Wnt3a, BDNF, RhoB, and Gbx2), and genes involved in various cellular processes (e.g. M-RAS, Sox17, Cdkn2b, LamA1, Col4a1, Foxa2, Foxq1, Klf5, and Igf2). Cell proliferation assays and Northern blot analyses of a number of ES cell markers (e.g. Rex1, Oct3/4, Fgf4, and Bmp4) suggest that the Hoxa1 protein plays a role in the inhibition of cell proliferation by RA in ES cells. Additionally, Hoxa1(-/-) ES cells express high levels of various endodermal markers, including Gata4 and Dab2, and express much less Fgf5 after leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) withdrawal. Finally, we propose a model in which the Hoxa1 protein mediates repression of endodermal differentiation while promoting expression of ectodermal and mesodermal characteristics.","['Martinez-Ceballos, Eduardo', 'Chambon, Pierre', 'Gudas, Lorraine J']","['Martinez-Ceballos E', 'Chambon P', 'Gudas LJ']","['Department of Pharmacology, Weill Medical College of Cornell University, New York, New York 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",20050218,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Bmp4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Bone Morphogenetic Protein 4)', '0 (Bone Morphogenetic Proteins)', '0 (CCN Intercellular Signaling Proteins)', '0 (CCN4 protein, mouse)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Octamer Transcription Factor-3)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Pbx1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Pou5f1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (homeobox A1 protein)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biomarkers', 'Bone Morphogenetic Protein 4', 'Bone Morphogenetic Proteins/metabolism', 'Brain/embryology/metabolism', 'CCN Intercellular Signaling Proteins', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Octamer Transcription Factor-3', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1', 'Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Tretinoin/*metabolism']",2005/02/22 09:00,2005/06/24 09:00,['2005/02/22 09:00'],"['2005/02/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/24 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(20)69334-6 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M414397200 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2005 Apr 22;280(16):16484-98. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M414397200.

As koalas are known to suffer from an extremely high incidence of leukaemia/lymphoma, the association between this retrovirus and disease in koalas was examined. Using quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase PCR it was demonstrated that KoRV RNA levels in plasma are significantly increased in animals suffering from leukaemia or lymphoma when compared with healthy animals. Increased levels of KoRV were also seen for animals with clinical chlamydiosis. A significant positive association between viral RNA levels and age was also demonstrated. Real-time PCR demonstrated as much as 5 log variation in KoRV proviral DNA levels in genomic DNA extracted from whole blood from different animals. Taken together these data indicate that KoRV is an active endogenous retrovirus and suggests that it may be causally linked to neoplastic disease in koalas.","['Tarlinton, Rachael', 'Meers, Joanne', 'Hanger, Jon', 'Young, Paul']","['Tarlinton R', 'Meers J', 'Hanger J', 'Young P']","['Department of Microbiology and Parasitology, School of Molecular and Microbial Sciences, University of Queensland, St Lucia 4072, Queensland, Australia.', 'School of Veterinary Science, University of Queensland, St Lucia 4072, Queensland, Australia.', 'Dreamworld, Coomera, Queensland, Australia.', 'Department of Microbiology and Parasitology, School of Molecular and Microbial Sciences, University of Queensland, St Lucia 4072, Queensland, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,J Gen Virol,The Journal of general virology,0077340,"['0 (RNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Endogenous Retroviruses/classification/enzymology/*genetics', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology/virology', 'Phascolarctidae/*virology', 'RNA, Viral/blood/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', '*Viremia']",2005/02/22 09:00,2005/04/12 09:00,['2005/02/22 09:00'],"['2005/02/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/12 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/22 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1099/vir.0.80547-0 [doi]'],ppublish,J Gen Virol. 2005 Mar;86(Pt 3):783-787. doi: 10.1099/vir.0.80547-0.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1099/vir.0.80547-0 [doi]

Although its effects on humans are well documented, arsenic's mechanism of action is not well understood. Its ability to act as a carcinogen and as a chemotherapeutic seems paradoxical. However, cancer cell transformation and cancer cell destruction can both occur through perturbations of the cell cycle machinery, making cell cycle function a likely target of arsenic action. Arsenic has previously been shown to inhibit cancer cell cycle progression, but the targeted cell cycle phase has been debated. This study was designed to identify the cell cycle phase at which U937 cells are most sensitive to arsenite-induced growth inhibition. Centrifugal elutriation was used to divide asynchronous cell cultures into specific cell cycle phase-enriched fractions. These fractions were monitored for cell cycle phase progression in the presence and absence of sodium arsenite. We found an overall reduction in cell cycle progression rather than induction of arrest at one specific checkpoint. G(2)/M is the phase most sensitive to arsenite-induced apoptosis. However, arsenite profoundly affects U937 cell growth by increasing the length of time it takes cells to transit each phase of the cell cycle. Future study of cell cycle inhibition by arsenic should consider that the effect may not be mediated by the major cell cycle checkpoints. Arsenic's ability to inhibit growth in any cell cycle phase may increase its value as a chemotherapeutic used together with other, more phase-selective agents, such as camptothecin.","['McCollum, Geniece', 'Keng, Peter C', 'States, J Christopher', 'McCabe, Michael J Jr']","['McCollum G', 'Keng PC', 'States JC', 'McCabe MJ Jr']","['Department of Environmental Medicine, University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry, NY 14642, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",20050218,United States,J Pharmacol Exp Ther,The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics,0376362,"['0 (Arsenites)', 'N5509X556J (arsenite)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects/physiology', 'Arsenites/*pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/*drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Division/drug effects/physiology', 'G2 Phase/*drug effects/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/*pathology', 'Mitosis/drug effects/physiology', 'U937 Cells']",2005/02/22 09:00,2005/07/06 09:00,['2005/02/22 09:00'],"['2005/02/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/06 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['jpet.104.080713 [pii]', '10.1124/jpet.104.080713 [doi]']",ppublish,J Pharmacol Exp Ther. 2005 May;313(2):877-87. doi: 10.1124/jpet.104.080713.

When cytogenetic abnormalities are complex, multiplex fluorescence in situ hybridization (M-FISH) can help clarify complex chromosomal abnormalities and identify rearrangements with prognostic value or cryptic translocations, which could be preliminary steps in identifying new genes. We studied by M-FISH 28 cases of MDS and AML with complex chromosomal abnormalities, 10 of them were therapy-related. M-FISH allowed the characterization of unidentified chromosomal material in 26 cases (93%). One or several unbalanced rearrangements were observed in 27 cases (96%), generally interpreted as deletions or additional material by CC. Among those translocations, 4 involved 3 chromosomes. Eighteen cryptic translocations undetected by CC were found in 13 cases. By FISH analysis using locus specific probes, TP53 deletion, additional copies of MLL, and additional copies or deletions of RUNX1/AML1 were observed in 16, 4, and 3 cases, respectively. Thus, M-FISH is an important tool to characterize complex chromosomal abnormalities which identified unbalanced and cryptic translocations in 96% and 46% of the cases studied, respectively. Complementary FISH helped us identify involvement of TP53, MLL, and RUNX1/AML1 genes in 82% of cases, confirming their probable role in leukemogenesis.","['Barouk-Simonet, Emmanuelle', 'Soenen-Cornu, Valerie', 'Roumier, Christophe', 'Cosson, Alain', 'Lai, Jean-Luc', 'Fenaux, Pierre', 'Preudhomme, Claude']","['Barouk-Simonet E', 'Soenen-Cornu V', 'Roumier C', 'Cosson A', 'Lai JL', 'Fenaux P', 'Preudhomme C']","['Institut de Recherches sur le Cancer de Lille, Unite Inserm 524, 1 place de Verdun, 59045 Lille, France.']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence/*methods', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics']",2005/02/22 09:00,2005/04/14 09:00,['2005/02/22 09:00'],"['2004/04/07 00:00 [received]', '2004/06/03 00:00 [revised]', '2004/06/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/02/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/14 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0165-4608(04)00272-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cancergencyto.2004.06.012 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 2005 Mar;157(2):118-26. doi: 10.1016/j.cancergencyto.2004.06.012.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated whether a vaccine targeting the BCR-ABL-derived p210 fusion protein was an active and specific immunotherapy. METHODS: We recruited 16 patients who had chronic myeloid leukaemia (with the b3a2 fusion point of p210), stable residual disease, a minimum treatment of 12 months of imatinib or 24 months of interferon alfa, and no further reduction of residual disease for at least 6 months preceding enrollment. They were given six vaccinations with a peptide vaccine derived from the sequence p210-b3a2 plus molgramostim and QS-21 as adjuvants (CMLVAX100) before assessment of immunological and disease response, which included detecting amounts of b3a2 transcripts by standardised quantitative real-time reverse-transcriptase PCR. RESULTS: Of ten patients on imatinib, nine started CMLVAX100 having had a median of 10 months' stable cytogenetic disease (median 10% Philadelphia-chromosome-positive metaphases), whereas one started in stable CCR. All patients' cytogenetic responses improved after six vaccinations, with five reaching CCR. Notably, three of these five patients also had undetectable amounts of b3a2 transcript (BCR-ABL:beta2 microglobulin ratio <0.00001). Six patients on interferon alfa treatment with a median of 17 months' stable residual disease (median 13% Philadelphia-chromosome-positive cells) were also vaccinated. All but one had improved cytogenetic responses, and two reached CCR. Overall, we recorded peptide-specific delayed-type hypersensitivity (in 11 of 16 patients), CD4 cell proliferation (13 of 14 assessed), and interferon gamma production (five of five assessed). INTERPRETATION: Addition of CMLVAX100 to conventional treatment in patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia might favour further reduction of residual disease and increase the number of patients reaching a molecular response.","['Bocchia, M', 'Gentili, S', 'Abruzzese, E', 'Fanelli, A', 'Iuliano, F', 'Tabilio, A', 'Amabile, M', 'Forconi, F', 'Gozzetti, A', 'Raspadori, D', 'Amadori, S', 'Lauria, F']","['Bocchia M', 'Gentili S', 'Abruzzese E', 'Fanelli A', 'Iuliano F', 'Tabilio A', 'Amabile M', 'Forconi F', 'Gozzetti A', 'Raspadori D', 'Amadori S', 'Lauria F']","['Department of Haematology, Siena University, Siena, Italy.

In the absence of Vif, APOBEC3G is encapsidated and blocks virus replication by deaminating cytosines of the viral cDNA. APOBEC3G encapsidation has been recently shown to depend on the viral nucleocapsid protein; however, the role of RNA remains unclear. Using APOBEC3G deletion and point mutants, we mapped the encapsidation determinant to the Zn(2+) coordination residues of the N-terminal catalytic domain (CD1). Notably, these residues were also required for RNA binding. Mutations in the two aromatic residues of CD1 but not CD2, which are conserved in cytidine deaminase core domains and are required for RNA binding, prevented encapsidation into HIV-1, HTLV-I and MLV. The Zn(2+) coordination residues of the C-terminal catalytic domain (CD2) were not required for encapsidation but were essential for cytidine deaminase activity and the antiviral effect. These findings suggest a model in which CD1 mediates encapsidation and RNA binding while CD2 mediates cytidine deaminase activity. Interestingly, HTLV-I was relatively resistant to the antiviral effects of encapsidated APOBEC3G.","['Navarro, Francisco', 'Bollman, Brooke', 'Chen, Hui', 'Konig, Renate', 'Yu, Qin', 'Chiles, Kristopher', 'Landau, Nathaniel R']","['Navarro F', 'Bollman B', 'Chen H', 'Konig R', 'Yu Q', 'Chiles K', 'Landau NR']","['Infectious Disease Laboratory, Salk Institute for Biological Studies, 10010 North Torrey Pines Road, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,"['0 (Gene Products, vif)', '0 (Nucleocapsid Proteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (vif Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 3.5.4.- (Nucleoside Deaminases)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (APOBEC-3G Deaminase)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (APOBEC3G protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (Cytidine Deaminase)', 'J41CSQ7QDS (Zinc)']",IM,"['APOBEC-3G Deaminase', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Catalytic Domain', 'Cytidine Deaminase', 'DNA/genetics', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Products, vif/physiology', 'Genes, Viral', 'Genes, vif', 'Genetic Complementation Test', 'HIV Infections/enzymology/virology', 'HIV-1/genetics/*physiology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics/physiology', 'Mice', 'Nucleocapsid Proteins/genetics/physiology', 'Nucleoside Deaminases', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Proteins/*chemistry/*physiology', 'Repressor Proteins', 'Virus Assembly', 'Virus Replication/genetics/physiology', 'Zinc/chemistry', 'vif Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus']",2005/02/22 09:00,2005/04/09 09:00,['2005/02/22 09:00'],"['2004/11/23 00:00 [received]', '2004/12/07 00:00 [revised]', '2005/01/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/02/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/09 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0042-6822(05)00018-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.virol.2005.01.011 [doi]']",ppublish,Virology. 2005 Mar 15;333(2):374-86. doi: 10.1016/j.virol.2005.01.011.,,,,"['AI58864/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'DA14494/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

MuLV-based vectors with a PBS complementary to tRNA(Lys,3) were found to be approximately 2-fold less infectious than vectors with the wild-type PBS complementary to tRNA(Pro). MuLV with a PBS complementary to tRNA(Lys,3) was replication competent and maintained the PBS during early stages of in vitro culture. Upon extended culture, PBS were isolated which were complementary to tRNA(Arg). A second MuLV was generated in which the region upstream of the PBS which is predicted to form an RNA stem loop structure was altered so that the nucleotide sequence within the loop would be complementary to the anticodon of tRNA(Lys,3). The virus with both the U5 and PBS complementary to tRNA(Lys,3) was also replication competent. Upon extended in vitro culture though, this virus reverted to utilize tRNA(Lys1,2). Analysis of the infectivity and replication of the wild-type and mutant viruses revealed that tRNA(Pro) was the preferred tRNA for high-level replication. Viruses with a PBS complementary to tRNA(Arg) or tRNA(Ly1,2) replicated at levels approximately 30% and 10% as effective as the wild-type virus, while virus with a PBS complementary to tRNA(Lys,3) had the slowest replication kinetics and least infectivity. Comparison of the virion tRNA content of the wild-type and mutant viruses revealed similar ratios with respect to levels of tRNA(Pro), tRNA(Arg) and tRNA(Lys). Modeling of the U5-PBS region revealed that the predicted RNA structure for the virus that selected tRNA(Arg) was more similar to the wild type virus that uses tRNA(Pro) than the virus which use tRNA(Lys1,2) or tRNA(Lys,3); the virus that uses tRNA(Lys,3) had the most profound disruption in the predicted RNA structure. The results of these studies demonstrate that MuLV has evolved to preferentially select tRNA(Pro) for high-level replication and are discussed with respect to common features of the primer selection process between MuLV and other retroviruses.","['Palmer, Matthew T', 'McPherson, Sylvia', 'Morrow, Casey D']","['Palmer MT', 'McPherson S', 'Morrow CD']","['Department of Cell Biology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, 720 20th Street, South, Birmingham, AL 35294-0024, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (RNA, Transfer, Lys)', '0 (RNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Adaptation, Physiological', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites/genetics', 'Cell Line', 'DNA, Viral/genetics', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Nucleic Acid Conformation', 'Plasmids/genetics', 'Proviruses/genetics', 'RNA, Transfer, Lys/*genetics', 'RNA, Viral/chemistry/genetics', 'Virus Cultivation', 'Virus Replication/genetics']",2005/02/22 09:00,2005/04/09 09:00,['2005/02/22 09:00'],"['2004/11/10 00:00 [received]', '2004/11/10 00:00 [revised]', '2004/12/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/02/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/09 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0042-6822(05)00003-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.virol.2004.12.033 [doi]']",ppublish,Virology. 2005 Mar 15;333(2):337-48. doi: 10.1016/j.virol.2004.12.033.,,,,"['AI 34749/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI27727/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several BH3 peptides relieved the inhibition of Bax caused by the antiapoptotic Bcl-x(L) and/or Mcl-1 proteins, some displaying a specificity for either Bcl-x(L) or Mcl-1. Besides having this derepression function, the Bid and Bim peptides activated Bax directly and were the only BH3 peptides tested that could potently induce cytochrome c release from mitochondria in cultured cells. Furthermore, Bax activator molecules (cleaved Bid protein and the Bim BH3 peptide) synergistically induced cytochrome c release when introduced into cells along with derepressor BH3 peptides. These observations support a unified model of BH3 domain function, encompassing both positive and negative regulation of other Bcl-2 family members.

The dental manifestations in CCD patients include supernumerary teeth, delayed tooth eruption, tooth hypoplasia and absence of cellular cementum formation. This disorder is associated with mutations in the osteoblast-specific transcription factor Runx2. To identify morphological and molecular alterations associated with CCD dental tissues, human primary dental pulp cell cultures were established from age- and sex-matched CCD and normal patients. Dental pulp cells were compared for general morphology, proliferation rates, and gene expression profiles using cDNA microarray technology. CCD pulp cells were about four-fold larger than normal cells, however the normal pulp proliferation rates were two- and three-fold greater at time points tested than the CCD cells. Of the 226 genes analysed by blot microarray, 18.6% displayed significant differences at least two-fold in expression levels. This includes 25 genes (11.1%) that were up-regulated, while 17 (7.5%) that were down-regulated in the CCD cells as compared to the normal cells. Expression of selected genes was further verified by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Comparison between the CDD and normal cells revealed that gene expression of cytokines and growth factors, such as leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and transforming growth factor beta receptor II (TGF-betaRII) and vascular endothelial growth factor B (VEGFB) were higher while bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) was lower in the CCD cells.

Recent clinical studies showed the importance of TPO schedule in relation to chemotherapy. Also, recombinant TPO facilitated collection of platelets in normal donors and patients for transfusions. The initial trials in leukemia or transplant settings did not impact the need for platelet transfusions. Future developments of TPO and mimetics will require carefully designed clinical trials with the consideration of unique biology of TPO and the time lag for a peak platelet response.","['Vadhan-Raj, Saroj', 'Cohen, Victor', 'Bueso-Ramos, Carlos']","['Vadhan-Raj S', 'Cohen V', 'Bueso-Ramos C']","['University of Texas, 1515 Holcombe Boulevard, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Curr Hematol Rep,Current hematology reports,101151358,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Growth Substances)']",IM,"['Cytokines/*pharmacology', 'Growth Substances/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukopenia/chemically induced/drug therapy', 'Thrombopoiesis/*drug effects', 'Time Factors']",2005/02/22 09:00,2006/03/03 09:00,['2005/02/22 09:00'],"['2005/02/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/03 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/22 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Curr Hematol Rep. 2005 Mar;4(2):137-44.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Advances in therapy for childhood leukemia have relied increasingly on the use of high-dose chemotherapy often combined with stem-cell transplantation. Despite a high success rate and intensification of therapy, children still suffer from relapse and progressive disease resistant to further therapy. Thus, novel forms of therapy are required. METHODS: This study focuses on dendritic cell (DC) vaccination of childhood leukemia and evaluates the in vitro efficacy of different strategies for antigen loading of professional antigen-presenting cells. We have compared DCs either loaded with apoptotic leukemia cells or transfected with mRNA from the same leukemia cell line, Jurkat E6, for their capacity to induce specific CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses. Monocyte-derived DCs from healthy donors were loaded with tumor antigen, matured and co-cultured with autologous T cells. After one week, T-cell responses against antigen-loaded DCs were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot (ELISPOT) assay. RESULTS: DCs loaded with apoptotic Jurkat E6 cells or transfected with Jurkat E6-cell mRNA were both able to elicit specific T-cell responses in vitro. IFNgamma-secreting T cells were observed in both the CD4+ and CD8+ subsets. CONCLUSION: The results indicate that loading of DCs with apoptotic leukemia cells or transfection with tumour mRNA represent promising strategies for development of cancer vaccines for treatment of childhood leukemia.","['Jarnjak-Jankovic, Silvija', 'Pettersen, Rolf D', 'Saeboe-Larssen, Stein', 'Wesenberg, Finn', 'Gaudernack, Gustav']","['Jarnjak-Jankovic S', 'Pettersen RD', 'Saeboe-Larssen S', 'Wesenberg F', 'Gaudernack G']","['Department of Pediatric Research, The National Hospital, Oslo, Norway. silvija.jankovic@klinmed.uio.no']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20050218,England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,"['0 (Cancer Vaccines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Cancer Vaccines/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia/immunology/*prevention & control', 'Phagocytosis', 'RNA, Messenger', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2005/02/22 09:00,2005/12/15 09:00,['2005/02/22 09:00'],"['2004/10/21 00:00 [received]', '2005/02/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/02/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/15 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['1471-2407-5-20 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2407-5-20 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2005 Feb 18;5:20. doi: 10.1186/1471-2407-5-20.,,,,,PMC554108,,,,,,,,,,,,

Squamous and basal cell carcinomas also exhibit greater subclinical tumor extension in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to estimate and compare the recurrence rates of squamous cell carcinoma after Mohs' surgery in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia compared with those in controls and to evaluate differences among squamous cell carcinoma size and histologic grade. METHODS: We retrospectively assessed the clinical histories, postoperative notes, and surgical photographs of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and controls matched (2:1) for age, sex, and surgical year. Both patients and controls underwent Mohs' surgery for squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck at the Mayo Clinic between March 1988 and April 1999. RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients who underwent Mohs' surgery for 57 squamous cell carcinomas had 7 recurrences. The cumulative incidence of recurrence on a per-tumor basis was 4.3% at 1 year, 14.8% at 3 years, and 19.0% at 5 years. Squamous cell carcinoma was seven times more likely to recur in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia than in controls (p = .003). The distribution of tumor histologic grade was not significantly different between patients and controls (p = .39). Maximum preoperative tumor diameters were clinically similar between patients and controls (median 15 mm vs 14 mm; p = .04). CONCLUSION: The recurrence rates of squamous cell carcinoma were significantly higher in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Squamous cell carcinomas in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia did not exhibit a significant difference in histologic grade or clinical difference in preoperative tumor size. Close surveillance for squamous cell carcinoma recurrence is warranted in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia.","['Mehrany, Khosrow', 'Weenig, Roger H', 'Pittelkow, Mark R', 'Roenigk, Randall K', 'Otley, Clark C']","['Mehrany K', 'Weenig RH', 'Pittelkow MR', 'Roenigk RK', 'Otley CC']","['Department of Dermatology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota 55905, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Dermatol Surg,Dermatologic surgery : official publication for American Society for Dermatologic Surgery [et al.],9504371,,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/*pathology/surgery', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*complications', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mohs Surgery', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*epidemiology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Skin Neoplasms/*pathology/surgery']",2005/02/22 09:00,2005/03/18 09:00,['2005/02/22 09:00'],"['2005/02/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/18 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/22 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1524-4725.2005.31006 [doi]'],ppublish,Dermatol Surg. 2005 Jan;31(1):38-42; discussion 42. doi: 10.1111/j.1524-4725.2005.31006.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This effect may be due to prevention of apoptosis of progenitor cells or upregulation of specific receptors on leukaemic precursors that make them more responsive to stimuli. This work investigates the relationship between serum leptin level, serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in acute leukaemic patients. The relationship to blood cell counts, haemoglobin and response to chemotherapy was also investigated. The study included 25 acute leukaemic male patients [15 acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and 10 acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL)] and 15 age and sex matched healthy controls. All were subjected to thorough history taking, clinical examination, complete blood picture, hepatic and renal function tests and determination of serum leptin, IL-6 and VEGF levels. In addition, patients were subjected to bone marrow aspiration, cytochemistry and immunophenotyping study and serum leptin assay after chemotherapy. Serum leptin level showed statistically significant elevation only in AML group (p<0.01). This elevation was unrelated to the presence of extramedullary infiltration or response to chemotherapy and correlated only with body mass index (p<0.05). In ALL, the mean serum leptin level was insignificantly different from the controls. In both AML and ALL, there was no significant difference in serum leptin level before and after treatment. Statistically significant elevation of IL-6 and VEGF, uncorrelated with serum leptin level was detected in AML patients when compared with the controls. No correlation was found between serum leptin level and any of the studied haematological parameters. It is concluded that the release of leptin, IL-6 and VEGF may be regulated by different mechanisms leading to diversity in clinical features of the disease.","['Hamed, Nahla A M', 'Sharaki, Ola A', 'Zeidan, Mohamed M']","['Hamed NA', 'Sharaki OA', 'Zeidan MM']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Alexandria University, Alexandria, Egypt.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Egypt,Egypt J Immunol,The Egyptian journal of immunology,9816016,"['0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leptin)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/*blood', 'Leptin/*blood', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*blood/drug therapy/*immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*blood/drug therapy/*immunology', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/*blood']",2005/02/22 09:00,2005/03/19 09:00,['2005/02/22 09:00'],"['2005/02/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/19 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/22 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Egypt J Immunol. 2003;10(1):57-66.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CNTF can also activate astrocytes, via its low affinity leukemia inhibitory receptor beta expressed on mature astrocytes, suggesting that CNTF may also protect injured neurons indirectly by modulating glia. Adenoviral-mediated overexpression of CNTF in normal and axotomized rat retinas was examined to determine if it could increase the expression of several glial markers previously demonstrated to have a neuroprotective function in the injured brain and retina. Using Western blotting, the expression of glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP), glutamate/aspartate transporter-1 (GLAST-1), glutamine synthetase (GS), and connexin 43 (Cx43) was examined 7 days after intravitreal injections of Ad.CNTF or control Ad.LacZ. Compared to controls, intravitreal injection of Ad.CNTF led to significant changes in the expression of CNTFRalpha, pSTAT(3), GFAP, GLAST, GS, and Cx43 in normal and axotomized retinas. Taken together, these results suggest that the neuroprotective effects of CNTF may result from a shift of retinal glia cells to a more neuroprotective phenotype. Moreover, the modulation of astrocytes may buffer high concentrations of glutamate that have been shown to contribute to the death of RGCs after optic nerve transection.","['van Adel, B A', 'Arnold, J M', 'Phipps, J', 'Doering, L C', 'Ball, A K']","['van Adel BA', 'Arnold JM', 'Phipps J', 'Doering LC', 'Ball AK']","['Department of Pathology and Molecular Medicine, Faculty of Health Sciences, HSC-1R1, McMaster University, Hamilton, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Neurobiol,Journal of neurobiology,0213640,"['0 (Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Neuroprotective Agents)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Axotomy/methods', 'Cell Survival/physiology', 'Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Female', 'Neuroglia/metabolism/*physiology', 'Neuroprotective Agents/*metabolism', 'Optic Nerve Injuries/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Retinal Ganglion Cells/*cytology/metabolism/physiology']",2005/02/19 09:00,2005/07/30 09:00,['2005/02/19 09:00'],"['2005/02/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/30 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/19 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/neu.20117 [doi]'],ppublish,J Neurobiol. 2005 Jun;63(3):215-34. doi: 10.1002/neu.20117.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There has been a marked increase in the number of incidences of therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia. It has become a distinctive disease because of its etiology and genetic tumorigenesis. The majority of tAML resulting from the use of cytotoxic agents can be divided into two groups based on the drugs administered to the patient. The first group includes the use of alkylating agents, and the second group includes agents that bind to the enzyme DNA-topoisomerase II. Due to the unfavorable outcome of the disease and the need for prompt intensive treatment, a timely accurate diagnosis of tAML is critical to patient care. Cytogenetic study can detect abnormalities most commonly associated with tAML and thus providing important diagnostic information. However, utilizing cytogenetic analysis alone cannot guarantee prompt and accurate results. In this study, an interesting case with therapy-related myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia (tMDS/tAML) will be presented. A laboratory diagnostic strategy for tAML laboratory diagnosis will also be proposed.","['Lu, Guo Hui']",['Lu GH'],"['Department of Pathology and Genetics, US Labs, Irvine, California 92602, USA. ghlu2003@yahoo.com']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,China,Beijing Da Xue Xue Bao Yi Xue Ban,Beijing da xue xue bao.

Moreover, neither reagent prevented the loss of Bcl-2. Ruthenium red (RR) devoid of Ru360 prevented Bcl-2 loss, release of Ca(2+) from the ER and the initiation of apoptosis. Since RR was significantly more sensitive than Ru360 to oxidation by singlet oxygen, we attribute the protective effect of RR to the quenching of reactive oxygen species.

In addition, dissipation of cellular bioenergy may impose a lethal effect on these quiescent cells. Previously, in multiple myeloma cell lines we demonstrated that halogenated adenosine (8-Cl-Ado) was phosphorylated to triphosphate (8-Cl-adenosine triphosphate [ATP]), which preferentially incorporated into mRNA and inhibited RNA synthesis by premature transcription termination. Furthermore, 8-Cl-ATP accumulation was associated with a decline in cellular bioenergy. Based on these actions, we hypothesized that 8-Cl-Ado would be ideal to target CLL lymphocytes. In the present study we demonstrate that leukemic lymphocytes incubated with 8-Cl-Ado display time- and dose-dependent increase in the accumulation of 8-Cl-ATP, with a parallel depletion of the endogenous ATP pool. Inhibition of global RNA synthesis resulted in a significant decline in the expression of transcripts with a short half-life such as MCL1. Consistent to this, protein expression of MCL-1 but not B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) was decreased. Furthermore, 8-Cl-ATP induced programmed cell death, as suggested by caspases activation, cleavage of caspase 3, and PARP (poly-adenosine diphosphate [ADP]-ribose polymerase), and increased DNA fragmentation. In conclusion, 8-Cl-Ado induces apoptosis in CLL lymphocytes by targeting cellular bioenergy as well as RNA transcription and translation of key survival genes such as MCL1.","['Balakrishnan, Kumudha', 'Stellrecht, Christine M', 'Genini, Davide', 'Ayres, Mary', 'Wierda, William G', 'Keating, Michael J', 'Leoni, Lorenzo M', 'Gandhi, Varsha']","['Balakrishnan K', 'Stellrecht CM', 'Genini D', 'Ayres M', 'Wierda WG', 'Keating MJ', 'Leoni LM', 'Gandhi V']","['Department of Experimental Therapeutics, Unit 71, The University of Texas M.

Two distinct groups of FLT3 mutations are found: internal tandem duplications (ITDs) of the juxtamembrane region and point mutations within the tyrosine kinase domain (TKD). Recently, point mutations within the activation loop of FLT3 have also been described in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). FLT3-ITD has been shown to induce a myeloproliferative syndrome in a murine bone marrow transplantation model. The phenotype of FLT3-TKD in mice has not yet been investigated. We transduced murine bone marrow with retrovirus-expressing FLT3-TKD mutants or FLT3-ITD and transplanted these cells into lethally irradiated mice. Mice that received a transplant of FLT3-ITD developed an oligoclonal myeloproliferative disease as previously described. In contrast, FLT3-TKD mutants induced an oligoclonal lymphoid disorder with longer latency and distinct hematologic manifestations: importantly, induction of the lymphoid phenotype was not due to a low number of transplanted cells. The lymphoid manifestation and longer latency of FLT3-TKD compared with FLT3-ITD mutants together with the lack of influence of FLT3-TKD mutations on the clinical outcome of patients with AML suggest differences in cell signaling between FLT3-TKD mutants and FLT3-ITDs. Indeed strong signal transducers and activators of transcription 5 (STAT5) activation could only be demonstrated for FLT3-ITDs.","['Grundler, Rebekka', 'Miething, Cornelius', 'Thiede, Christian', 'Peschel, Christian', 'Duyster, Justus']","['Grundler R', 'Miething C', 'Thiede C', 'Peschel C', 'Duyster J']","['Department of Internal Medicine III, Technical University of Munich, Ismaningerstr 22, 81675 Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20050217,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Milk Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Flt3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cell Separation', 'DNA, Complementary/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/metabolism', 'Immunoblotting', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Milk Proteins/metabolism', 'Mutation', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/genetics', 'Phenotype', 'Point Mutation', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*chemistry', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*chemistry/*genetics', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*chemistry/*genetics', 'Recombinant Proteins/chemistry', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor', 'Signal Transduction', 'Splenomegaly/pathology', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism', 'Treatment Outcome', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3']",2005/02/19 09:00,2005/07/14 09:00,['2005/02/19 09:00'],"['2005/02/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/14 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)53415-0 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2004-11-4430 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2005 Jun 15;105(12):4792-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2004-11-4430.

Unrepaired or misrepaired DSBs can lead to apoptotic death or chromosomal damage. The B cells of some B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) patients are resistant to radiation-induced apoptosis in vitro. We show here that the novel DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) inhibitor, NU7026 (2-(morpholin-4-yl)-benzo[h]chomen-4-one), and the phosphatidylinositol 3 (PI-3) kinase inhibitor, wortmannin, restored sensitivity to DNA damage-induced apoptosis of otherwise resistant cells. These resistant malignant B cells also escaped DSB-induced apoptosis following exposure to etoposide or neocarzinostatin. We found that at 15 minutes after irradiation, the levels of NHEJ (as measured by an in vitro DSB end-ligation assay) and DNA-PK catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs) activity were, respectively, 2-fold and 4-fold higher in radio-resistant than in radio-sensitive B-CLL cells or Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-transformed B cells. Ku70/Ku80 heterodimer DNA end-binding activity was also 2- to 3-fold higher in the resistant B-CLL cell subset compared with the sensitive B-CLL cell subset. Our results provide the first evidence that overactivating the NHEJ DNA repair pathway impairs DNA damage-induced apoptosis in malignant B cells and that this may contribute to their resistance to current chemotherapy.","['Deriano, Ludovic', 'Guipaud, Olivier', 'Merle-Beral, Helene', 'Binet, Jacques-Louis', 'Ricoul, Michelle', 'Potocki-Veronese, Gaby', 'Favaudon, Vincent', 'Maciorowski, Zofia', 'Muller, Catherine', 'Salles, Bernard', 'Sabatier, Laure', 'Delic, Jozo']","['Deriano L', 'Guipaud O', 'Merle-Beral H', 'Binet JL', 'Ricoul M', 'Potocki-Veronese G', 'Favaudon V', 'Maciorowski Z', 'Muller C', 'Salles B', 'Sabatier L', 'Delic J']","[""Laboratoire de Radiobiologie et Oncologie, Commissariat a l'Enegie Atomique, Fontenay-aux-Roses, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20050217,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (2-(morpholin-4-yl)benzo(h)chromen-4-one)', '0 (Androstadienes)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antigens, Nuclear)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Chromones)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Morpholines)', '1W21G5Q4N2 (Okadaic Acid)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', '9014-02-2 (Zinostatin)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 3.6.4.12 (Xrcc6 protein, human)', 'EC 4.2.99.- (Ku Autoantigen)', 'XVA4O219QW (Wortmannin)']",IM,"['Androstadienes/pharmacology', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Antigens, Nuclear/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'B-Lymphocytes/pathology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell-Free System', 'Chromones/pharmacology', 'DNA/metabolism', 'DNA Damage', '*DNA Repair', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Dimerization', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', 'Gamma Rays', 'Humans', 'Ku Autoantigen', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/*pathology', 'Morpholines/pharmacology', 'Okadaic Acid/pharmacology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/pharmacology', 'Protein Binding', 'Telomere/ultrastructure', 'Time Factors', 'Wortmannin', 'Zinostatin/pharmacology']",2005/02/19 09:00,2005/07/14 09:00,['2005/02/19 09:00'],"['2005/02/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/14 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)53413-7 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2004-07-2888 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2005 Jun 15;105(12):4776-83. doi: 10.1182/blood-2004-07-2888.

Array CGH defined an MCL genomic signature distinct from other B-cell lymphomas, including deletions of 1p21 and 11q22.3-ATM gene with coincident 10p12-BMI1 gene amplification and 10p14 deletion, along with a previously unidentified loss within 9q21-q22. Specific genomic alterations were associated with different subgroups of disease. Notably, 11 patients with leukemic MCL showed a different genomic profile than nodal cases, including 8p21.3 deletion at tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) receptor gene cluster (55% versus 19%; P = .01) and gain of 8q24.1 at MYC locus (46% versus 14%; P = .015). Additionally, leukemic MCL exhibited frequent IGVH mutation (64% versus 21%; P = .009) with preferential VH4-39 use (36% versus 4%; P = .005) and followed a more indolent clinical course. Blastoid variants, increased number of genomic gains, and deletions of P16/INK4a and TP53 genes correlated with poorer outcomes, while 1p21 loss was associated with prolonged survival (P = .02). In multivariate analysis, deletion of 9q21-q22 was the strongest predictor for inferior survival (hazard ratio [HR], 6; confidence interval [CI], 2.3 to 15.7).

We used this sheep model of adolescent pregnancy to investigate whether placental growth restriction is associated with altered placental cell proliferation and/or apoptosis at d 81 of pregnancy, equivalent to the apex in placental growth. Adolescent ewes with singleton pregnancies were offered a high or moderate level of a complete diet designed to induce restricted or normal placental size at term, respectively. Bromodeoxyuridine (Brd-U) was administered to H and M ewes 1 h before slaughter. Placental tissues were examined for a) Brd-U (immunohistochemistry) and b) apoptosis regulatory genes by in situ hybridization, Northern analyses (bax, mcl-1), immunohistochemistry, and Western analyses (bax). Quantification was carried out by image analysis. Total placentome weights were equivalent between groups. Brd-U predominantly localized to the trophectoderm and was significantly lower in the H group. Bax and mcl-1 mRNA were localized to the maternal-fetal interface. Bax protein was significantly increased in the H group and predominant in the uninuclear fetal trophectoderm.

Members of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and angiopoietin family represent the most specific inducers of angiogenesis secreted by AML blasts. We therefore correlated expression of angiogenic factors with clinical variables. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We investigated the expression of VEGF-A, VEGF-C, angiopoietin-1 (Ang1), angiopoietin-2 (Ang2), and the receptor Tie2 by quantitative polymerase chain reaction in a cohort of 90 patients younger than 61 years with de novo AML entered into the German AML Suddeutsche Hamoblastose Gruppe Hannover 95 trial. Uni- and multivariate analyses were performed using clinical and gene expression variables. RESULTS: Univariate analysis of overall survival indicated the following variables as prognostic factors: good response on a day-15 bone marrow examination after initiation of induction chemotherapy, karyotype, and high Ang2 expression. In multivariate analysis, only bad response and log Ang2 expression remained of statistical significance, with a hazard ratio of 3.51 (95% CI, 1.91 to 6.47) and 0.75 (95% CI, 0.61 to 0.91), respectively. Subgroup analysis suggested that the prognostic impact of Ang2 expression was especially evident in cohorts with low VEGF-C and Ang1 mRNA levels. CONCLUSION: These results show that expression of Ang2 represents an independent prognostic factor in AML. Additional research into interactions of angiogenic cytokines in the pathogenesis of bone marrow angiogenesis in AML is warranted.","['Loges, Sonja', 'Heil, Gerhard', 'Bruweleit, Melanie', 'Schoder, Volker', 'Butzal, Martin', 'Fischer, Uta', 'Gehling, Ursula M', 'Schuch, Gunter', 'Hossfeld, Dieter K', 'Fiedler, Walter']","['Loges S', 'Heil G', 'Bruweleit M', 'Schoder V', 'Butzal M', 'Fischer U', 'Gehling UM', 'Schuch G', 'Hossfeld DK', 'Fiedler W']","['Medizinische Klinik II, University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf, Martinistrasse 52, 20246 Hamburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Angiopoietin-1)', '0 (Angiopoietin-2)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor C)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, TIE-2)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Angiopoietin-1/metabolism', 'Angiopoietin-2/*metabolism', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Prognosis', 'Receptor, TIE-2/metabolism', 'Survival Analysis', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/metabolism', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor C/metabolism', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors/*metabolism']",2005/02/19 09:00,2005/03/12 09:00,['2005/02/19 09:00'],"['2005/02/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/12 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['23/6/1109 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2005.05.058 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2005 Feb 20;23(6):1109-17. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2005.05.058.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There is a high rate of recurrence despite first-line chemotherapy. Sarcoma of the uterus, while accounting for a small percent of uterine cancers, is also associated with a high-recurrence rate and poor overall survival. Therefore, the development of novel treatment strategies is paramount. Imatinib mesylate (Gleevec; Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corp., East Hanover, NJ) is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor with activity against abl, c-kit, and platelet derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), and is approved for the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia and gastrointestinal stromal tumor. Preclinical data provides evidence for c-kit and PDGFR expression in ovarian epithelial carcinomas and uterine sarcomas and have led to clinical trials evaluating the use of imatinib in these malignancies. Additionally, inhibition of PDGFR signaling has been proposed as an effective mechanism of chemotherapy by lowering tumor interstitial fluid pressure. Recent data have also suggested benefit with metronomic scheduling of cytotoxic agents at lower doses at more frequent dosing intervals, in combination with other targeted therapies. While activity of this agent remains to be established, further studies of imatinib in gynecologic malignancies are warranted, to demonstrate not only single-agent activity and the enhancement of cytotoxicity of other antineoplastic agents.","['Dushkin, Holly', 'Schilder, Russell J']","['Dushkin H', 'Schilder RJ']","['Fox Chase Cancer Center, 333 Cottman Avenue, Philadelphia, PA 19111, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Curr Treat Options Oncol,Current treatment options in oncology,100900946,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Benzamides', 'Biological Availability', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Genital Neoplasms, Female/*drug therapy/mortality/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Maximum Tolerated Dose', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*prevention & control', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Piperazines/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Prognosis', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Risk Assessment', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Uterine Neoplasms/drug therapy/mortality/pathology']",2005/02/19 09:00,2005/06/29 09:00,['2005/02/19 09:00'],"['2005/02/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/29 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/19 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s11864-005-0019-9 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Treat Options Oncol. 2005 Mar;6(2):115-20. doi: 10.1007/s11864-005-0019-9.,36,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Induction therapy for AML was performed with frequent platelet transfusions because of the patient's severe hemorrhagic manifestations. In the second remission, the patient was successfully treated by BMT from an HLA-matched unrelated donor. Platelet function returned to normal, and the GT phenotype completely disappeared. Our experience suggests that BMT is a curative therapeutic strategy for GT. Furthermore, we believe this study is the first to demonstrate that engraftment after BMT for AML can be determined by monitoring the congenital genetic defect of GT.","['Fujimoto, Tetsuro-Takahiro', 'Kishimoto, Miho', 'Ide, Kazuko', 'Mizushima, Miyoko', 'Mita, Masashi', 'Sezaki, Nobuo', 'Kojima, Kensuke', 'Shinagawa, Katsuji', 'Niiya, Kenji', 'Tanimoto, Mitsune', 'Fujimura, Kingo']","['Fujimoto TT', 'Kishimoto M', 'Ide K', 'Mizushima M', 'Mita M', 'Sezaki N', 'Kojima K', 'Shinagawa K', 'Niiya K', 'Tanimoto M', 'Fujimura K']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Division of Clinical Pharmacotherapeutics, Program for Applied Biomedicine, Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima Japan. fujimot@hiroshima-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,,IM,"['Acute Disease', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*complications/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Thrombasthenia/*complications/genetics/*therapy']",2005/02/19 09:00,2005/03/24 09:00,['2005/02/19 09:00'],"['2005/02/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/24 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/19 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1532/ijh97.04044 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2005 Jan;81(1):77-80. doi: 10.1532/ijh97.04044.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The disease is characterized by lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, skin lesions, a high white blood cell count, and an aggressive clinical course.

The diagnosis of small cell variant T-PLL in a 56-year-old woman was based on the findings of abnormal lymphocytosis, immunophenotype, lymphadenopathy, and aggressive clinical behavior. Immunophenotype analysis showed that lymphocytes were positive for CD2, CD3, CD5, CD7, CD8, and TCR gammadelta antigens and negative for CD1a, CD4, and TCR alphabeta antigens. Southern blot analysis revealed rearrangement of the TCR Jgamma and Jdelta-1 genes. A cytogenetic study of peripheral blood showed a normal karyotype. T-PLL with a TCR gammadelta phenotype is very rare. This case was typical T-PLL except for the morphologically small cell type and the lack of the typical chromosome aberration.

One major contribution to this success has been reduction of the rate of central nervous system (CNS) relapses to less than 5%. However, heterogeneity is observed with regard to the incidence of CNS relapse in homogenously treated patient populations. One potential explanation for this heterogeneity is variation in the genetic background of these populations. Glutathione S-transferase P1 and P-glycoprotein are implicated in resistance to a variety of chemotherapeutic agents and have been localized to the blood-brain barrier. In a matched case-control study, we investigated the associations between CNS relapse in childhood ALL and the presence of phenotypically relevant single nucleotide polymorphisms within the GSTP1 (codon 105 and 114) and MDR1 genes (ABCB1; coding for Pgp; exon 26, C3435T). Significant reductions in risk of CNS relapse were observed for patients homozygous for the GSTP1 Val105 allele as well as for patients with the MDR1 3435T/T or C/T genotype. For both genotypes, the effect was restricted to patients at intermediate or high risk of treatment failure.

This association exists because of the extensive and complicated interaction between cellular donor components and recipient components concomitant with cytokine storms. It has been demonstrated that part of this interaction may be related to the induction of a variety of regulatory cells, such as regulatory T-cells and natural killer T (NKT) cells. A lower number of NKT cells may be found in patients with autoimmune diseases, cancer, viral infection, and severe GVHD. When activated, NKT cells rapidly release suppressive cytokines, such as interleukin 4 (IL-4), IL-10, and IL-13, as well as inflammatory cytokines, such as interferon gamma and tumor necrosis factor alpha. NKT cells therefore act as a double-edged sword in their progressive or suppressive effects on diseases. Such contradictory phenomena may be related to the function or types of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) in response to their ligand. A single-dose injection of a ligand for NKT cells, alpha-galactosylceramide (alpha-GalCer), can induce immunity through fully mature dendritic cells in an antigen-specific manner. By contrast, multiple injections of alpha-GalCer would induce tolerance, which may be caused by immature APCs. This response suggests that the function of NKT cells can be determined by alpha-GalCer for controlling the immune response. Furthermore, activation of NKT cells followed by activation of APCs and IL-12 production may lead to activation of NK cells and suppress GVHD in mismatched major histocompatibility complex combinations or may induce GVL effects. Control and modification of NKT cell function may play an important role in regulating GVHD/GVL effects.","['Fujii, Shin-ichiro']",['Fujii S'],"['Research Unit for Cellular Immunotherapy, Research Center for Allergy and Immunology, Riken, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan. fujiis@rcai.riken.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,,IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*immunology', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*immunology', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology']",2005/02/19 09:00,2005/03/24 09:00,['2005/02/19 09:00'],"['2005/02/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/24 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/19 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF02983991 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2005 Jan;81(1):1-5. doi: 10.1007/BF02983991.,50,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Some time after its discovery a group of diseases were related to this virus, such as, adult T-cell leukemia lymphoma (ATLL), HTLV-1 associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP) and HTLV-1 associated uveitis (HAU). In the nineties, HTLV-1 was associated to a severe eczema of children, called infective dermatitis (ID). Since then, several other skin manifestations have been observed in HTLV-1-infected individuals, particularly in patients with ATLL or HAM/TSP. However, according to some reports, dermatologic lesions are also common in asymptomatic HTLV-1 carriers. Besides ID, all other skin lesions reported are nonspecific. The aim of this review is to outline the dermatologic manifestations reported in HTLV-1 infected patients, emphasizing the clinical and epidemiological value of these findings.","['Nobre, Vandack', 'Guedes, Antonio Carlos Martins', 'Proietti, Fernando Augusto', 'Stanciolli, Edel', 'Martins, Marina Lobato', 'Serufo, Jose Carlos', 'Antunes, Carlos Mauricio', 'Grossi, Maria Aparecida', 'Lambertucci, Jose Roberto']","['Nobre V', 'Guedes AC', 'Proietti FA', 'Stanciolli E', 'Martins ML', 'Serufo JC', 'Antunes CM', 'Grossi MA', 'Lambertucci JR']","['Servico de Doencas Infecciosas e Parasitarias, Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil.']",['por'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",20050118,Brazil,Rev Soc Bras Med Trop,Revista da Sociedade Brasileira de Medicina Tropical,7507456,,IM,"['Dermatitis/classification/diagnosis/*virology', 'HTLV-I Infections/*complications', 'Humans', 'Skin Diseases, Viral/classification/diagnosis/*virology']",2005/02/18 09:00,2005/04/15 09:00,['2005/02/18 09:00'],"['2005/02/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/15 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0037-86822005000100009 [pii]', '10.1590/s0037-86822005000100009 [doi]']",ppublish,Rev Soc Bras Med Trop. 2005 Jan-Feb;38(1):43-52. doi: 10.1590/s0037-86822005000100009.

In CML they occur in 10-15% of cases and appear to indicate a worse prognosis, whereas in ALL, the situation is unclear. This study presents the findings of dual fusion FISH used to detect such deletions in a series of 27 BCR/ ABL-positive childhood ALL patients. Metaphase FISH was essential for the accurate interpretation of interphase FISH signal patterns. Three cases (11%) had a single fusion signal, resulting from deletions of the der(9). Three other patients with variant translocations and one with an insertion, also had a single fusion, but with no evidence of deletions. Gain of a fusion in approximately one-third of patients indicated a second Ph, which appears to be a diagnostic marker of Ph-positive ALL.

We assessed 37 previously untreated lymphoma patients undergoing a hd-chemotherapy program with autografting. They sequentially received hd-cyclophosphamide (CY) and hd-Ara-C, both followed by PBPC harvesting. Both post-CY and post-Ara-C harvests were assessed for TL by Southern blot analysis. In 12 patients, the assay was also performed on purified CD34+ cells. All patients displayed high PBPC mobilization following both hd-CY and hd-Ara-C. In all but one patient, TL was shorter in PBPC collected after Ara-C compared to CY: 7226bp (range: 4135-9852) vs 8282 bp (range 4895-14860) (P < 0.0001). This result was confirmed on CD34+ cells. Platelet recovery in patients receiving post-Ara-C PBPC was significantly slower compared to those receiving post-CY PBPC. In conclusion, (i) administration of tightly spaced hd-chemotherapy courses induces marked telomere shortening on harvested PBPC; (ii) engraftment kinetics seem slower, with delayed platelet recovery, in patients autografted with PBPC suffering marked TL erosion; (iii) long-term follow-up is required to verify whether PBPC with shortened telomeres display defective engraftment stability and/or risk of secondary leukemia; (iv) TL evaluation is advisable whenever new mobilization procedures are developed.","['Ricca, I', 'Compagno, M', 'Ladetto, M', 'Rocci, A', ""Dell'Aquila, M"", 'Omede, P', 'De Marco, F', ""D'Antico, S"", 'Caracciolo, D', 'Ferrero, D', 'Carlo-Stella, C', 'Tarella, C']","['Ricca I', 'Compagno M', 'Ladetto M', 'Rocci A', ""Dell'Aquila M"", 'Omede P', 'De Marco F', ""D'Antico S"", 'Caracciolo D', 'Ferrero D', 'Carlo-Stella C', 'Tarella C']","['Divisione di Ematologia, Dipartimento di Medicina ed Oncologia Sperimentale, Universita di Torino and A.

To engineer such viruses infectivity can be coupled with proteolytic activity of the target cell by modifying the envelope (Env) protein of murine leukaemia virus (MLV) with blocking domains that prevent cell entry unless they are cleaved off by tumour-associated proteases like the matrix metalloproteases (MMP). Here we show that MLV variants selectively spreading through MMP-positive cells can be evolved from virus libraries, in which a standard MMP-2 substrate peptide connecting the blocking domain CD40L with the Env protein was diversified. Passaging the virus library on human fibrosarcoma or glioma cell lines resulted in the selection of about 10 virus clones, of which the three most frequent ones were shown to become activated by MMPs and to be replication competent on MMP-positive cells only. On these cells, the selected linker peptides improved the spreading by several orders of magnitude in vitro, as well as in tumour xenografts in vivo, approaching the kinetic of the unmodified wild-type virus. The data suggest that retroviral protease substrate libraries form a potent tool for the engineering of viruses conditionally replicating in a given cancer cell type of interest.","['Hartl, I', 'Schneider, R M', 'Sun, Y', 'Medvedovska, J', 'Chadwick, M P', 'Russell, S J', 'Cichutek, K', 'Buchholz, C J']","['Hartl I', 'Schneider RM', 'Sun Y', 'Medvedovska J', 'Chadwick MP', 'Russell SJ', 'Cichutek K', 'Buchholz CJ']","['Medizinische Biotechnologie, Paul-Ehrlich-Institut, Langen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Gene Ther,Gene therapy,9421525,['EC 3.4.24.- (Matrix Metalloproteinases)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Western', '*Gene Library', 'Gene Targeting/methods', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'Matrix Metalloproteinases/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neoplasms/enzymology/*virology', 'Plasmids/genetics', 'Retroviridae/genetics/*physiology', 'Tropism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Virus Activation/physiology', 'Virus Replication/physiology']",2005/02/18 09:00,2005/09/21 09:00,['2005/02/18 09:00'],"['2005/02/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/21 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['3302467 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.gt.3302467 [doi]']",ppublish,Gene Ther. 2005 Jun;12(11):918-26. doi: 10.1038/sj.gt.3302467.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When subunits of the shared receptor complex are inactivated by homologous recombination, the mice die at approximately birth and exhibit reduced numbers of motoneurons in the spinal cord and brainstem nuclei. However, mice in which cntf, lif, or cardiotrophin-1 (ct-1) are inactivated can survive and show less motoneuron cell loss. This suggests cooperative and redundant roles of these ligands. However, their cooperative functions are not well understood. We generated cntf/lif/ct-1 triple-knock-out and combinations of double-knock-out mice to study the individual and combined roles of CNTF, LIF and CT-1 on postnatal motoneuron survival and function. Triple-knock-out mice exhibit increased motoneuron cell loss in the lumbar spinal cord that correlates with muscle weakness during early postnatal development. LIF deficiency leads to pronounced loss of distal axons and motor endplate alterations, whereas CNTF-and/or CT-1-deficient mice do not show significant changes in morphology of these structures. In cntf/lif/ct-1 triple-knock-out mice, various degrees of muscle fiber type grouping are found, indicating that denervation and reinnervation had occurred. We conclude from these findings that CNTF, LIF, and CT-1 have distinct functions for motoneuron survival and function and that LIF plays a more important role for postnatal maintenance of distal axons and motor endplates than CNTF or CT-1.","['Holtmann, Bettina', 'Wiese, Stefan', 'Samsam, Mohtashem', 'Grohmann, Katja', 'Pennica, Diane', 'Martini, Rudolf', 'Sendtner, Michael']","['Holtmann B', 'Wiese S', 'Samsam M', 'Grohmann K', 'Pennica D', 'Martini R', 'Sendtner M']","['The Institute for Clinical Neurobiology, Department of Neurology, D-97080 Wuerzburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Neurosci,The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,8102140,"['0 (Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', 'AJ7U77BR8I (cardiotrophin 1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor/deficiency/genetics/*physiology', 'Cytokines/deficiency/genetics/*physiology', 'Hand Strength', 'Interleukin-6/genetics/*physiology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Motor Endplate/ultrastructure', 'Motor Neurons/*physiology', 'Muscle Denervation', 'Muscle Fibers, Skeletal/*pathology', 'Muscle Weakness/genetics/pathology/*physiopathology', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Peripheral Nerves/pathology', 'Spinal Cord/pathology']",2005/02/18 09:00,2005/10/14 09:00,['2005/02/18 09:00'],"['2005/02/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/10/14 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['25/7/1778 [pii]', '10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4249-04.2005 [doi]']",ppublish,J Neurosci. 2005 Feb 16;25(7):1778-87. doi: 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4249-04.2005.,,,,,PMC6725944,,,,,,,,,,,,

Abl, which is a protein tyrosine kinase whose constitutive activity is responsible for chronic myelogenous leukemia, was covalently linked to the surfaces of silicon nanowires within microfluidic channels to create active electrical devices. Concentration-dependent binding of ATP and concentration-dependent inhibition of ATP binding by the competitive small-molecule antagonist STI-571 (Gleevec) were assessed by monitoring the nanowire conductance. In addition, concentration-dependent inhibition of ATP binding was examined for four additional small molecules, including reported and previously unreported inhibitors.

We postulated (i) that chain peroxidation triggered by iron-catalyzed turnover of nascent hydroperoxides (LOOHs) generated by singlet oxygen ((1)O(2)) attack on PM lipids contributes significantly to overall cytolethality, and (ii) that nitric oxide (NO), a known scavenger of organic free radicals, would suppress this and, thus, act cytoprotectively. In accordance, irradiation of MC540-sensitized L1210 cells produced 5alpha-OOH, a definitive (1)O(2) adduct of PM cholesterol, which decayed during subsequent dark incubation with appearance of other signature peroxides, viz. free-radical-derived 7alpha/beta-OOH. Whereas chemical donor (SPNO or SNAP)-derived NO had little or no effect on post-irradiation 5alpha-OOH disappearance, it dose-dependently inhibited 7alpha/beta-OOH accumulation, consistent with interception of chain-carrying radicals arising from one-electron reduction of primary LOOHs. Using [(14)C]cholesterol as an L1210 PM probe, we detected additional after-light products of chain peroxidation, including diols (7alpha-OH, 7beta-OH) and 5,6-epoxides, the yields of which were enhanced by iron supplementation, but strongly suppressed by NO. Correspondingly, photoinitiated cell killing was significantly inhibited by NO introduced either immediately before or after light exposure. These findings indicate that prooxidant LOOH turnover plays an important role in photokilling and that NO, by intercepting propagating radicals, can significantly enhance cellular resistance.","['Zareba, Mariusz', 'Niziolek, Magdalena', 'Korytowski, Witold', 'Girotti, Albert W']","['Zareba M', 'Niziolek M', 'Korytowski W', 'Girotti AW']","['Department of Biochemistry, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI 53226, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",20041208,Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (Membrane Lipids)', '0 (Photosensitizing Agents)', '0 (Pyrimidinones)', '31C4KY9ESH (Nitric Oxide)', '58823-12-4 (merocyanine dye)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival', 'Iron/chemistry', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/pathology', '*Lipid Peroxidation', 'Membrane Lipids/*chemistry', 'Mice', 'Nitric Oxide/*chemistry', 'Oxidation-Reduction', '*Photochemotherapy', 'Photosensitizing Agents/metabolism/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidinones/metabolism/*therapeutic use']",2005/02/18 09:00,2005/04/29 09:00,['2005/02/18 09:00'],"['2004/09/28 00:00 [received]', '2004/11/13 00:00 [revised]', '2004/11/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/02/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/29 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0304-4165(04)00295-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbagen.2004.11.007 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 2005 Feb 11;1722(1):51-9. doi: 10.1016/j.bbagen.2004.11.007.

We demonstrate here that an infectious strain of BLV containing the mutant D247G form of Tax also differs in its capacity to modulate cell survival both positively and negatively. When peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) infected with wild-type or mutant BLV are cultured ex vivo with staurosporine, an agent known to induce a mitochondrial caspase cascade pathway regulating apoptosis, the rate of apoptosis is reduced to a greater extent in cells infected with mutant BLV than wild-type BLV, consistent with previous observations in cultures without staurosporine. The increase in survival was associated with an increase in expression of mRNA of bcl-xl but not bcl-2 and bax ex vivo. In contrast, when a tissue culture-adapted cell line, 293T, was transiently transfected with either wild-type or mutant BLV, apoptosis was induced. The increase in the rate of apoptosis was higher in cells transfected with mutant BLV. The same difference was noted in cells transiently transfected with wild-type and mutant D247G Tax, suggesting that the observed positive and negative modulation of cell survival is attributed to the functional characteristics of mutant D247G Tax.","['Takahashi, Masahiko', 'Tajima, Shigeru', 'Okada, Kosuke', 'Davis, William C', 'Aida, Yoko']","['Takahashi M', 'Tajima S', 'Okada K', 'Davis WC', 'Aida Y']","['Retrovirus Research Unit, RIKEN, Wako, Saitama 351-0198, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20041215,France,Microbes Infect,Microbes and infection,100883508,"['0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Gene Products, tax/genetics/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/genetics/*physiology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear', 'Mutation', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/analysis/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Sheep', 'Staurosporine/pharmacology', 'Transfection', 'bcl-X Protein']",2005/02/18 09:00,2005/07/16 09:00,['2005/02/18 09:00'],"['2004/08/13 00:00 [received]', '2004/09/17 00:00 [revised]', '2004/09/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/02/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/16 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1286-4579(04)00331-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.micinf.2004.09.014 [doi]']",ppublish,Microbes Infect. 2005 Jan;7(1):19-28. doi: 10.1016/j.micinf.2004.09.014.

In osteoblasts, they govern the magnitude of gene response to osteotropic factors like parathyroid hormone (PTH). Nmp4/CIZ is recurrently involved in acute leukemia and it has been implicated in spermatogenesis. However, these conserved proteins, derived from a single gene, are expressed in numerous tissues indicative of a more generalized housekeeping function in addition to their tissue-specific roles. To address how Nmp4/CIZ expression is governed, we characterized the 5' regulatory region of the mouse Nmp4 gene, located on chromosome 6. Two adjacent promoters P(1) [-2521 nucleotide (nt)/-597 nt] and P(2) (-2521 nt/+1 nt) initiate transcription of alternative first exons (U(1) and U(2)). Both promoters lack TATA and CCAAT boxes but contain initiator sites and CpG islands. Northern analysis revealed expression of both U(1) and U(2) in numerous adult tissues consistent with the constitutive and ubiquitous activity of a housekeeping gene. Sequence analysis identified numerous potential transcription factor-binding sites significant to osteogenesis, hematopoeisis, and gonadal development. The promoters are active in both osteoblast-like cells and in the M12 B-lymphocyte cell line. Low doses of PTH attenuated P(1)/P(2) activity in osteoblast-like cells. The Nmp4/CIZ promoters are autoregulated and deletion analysis identified regions that drive P(1) and P(2) basal activities as well as regions that contain positive and negative regulatory elements affecting transcription. The Nmp4/CIZ promoters comprise a genomic regulatory architecture that supports constitutive expression as well as cell- and tissue-specific regulation.","['Alvarez, Marta', 'Shah, Rita', 'Rhodes, Simon J', 'Bidwell, Joseph P']","['Alvarez M', 'Shah R', 'Rhodes SJ', 'Bidwell JP']","['Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, Indiana University School of Medicine, Medical Science Bldg 5035, 635 Barnhill Drive, Indianapolis, IN 46202, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",20050121,Netherlands,Gene,Gene,7706761,"['0 (Nuclear Matrix-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Zfp384 protein, mouse)', '0 (Zfp384 protein, rat)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'CpG Islands', 'Exons/*genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes, Regulator/genetics', 'Hematopoiesis/genetics', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nuclear Matrix-Associated Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Organ Specificity', 'Osteogenesis/genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/*genetics/physiology', 'Rats', 'Transcription Factors/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic/*genetics/physiology']",2005/02/18 09:00,2005/06/04 09:00,['2005/02/18 09:00'],"['2004/07/23 00:00 [received]', '2004/09/27 00:00 [revised]', '2004/10/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/02/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/04 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0378-1119(04)00641-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.gene.2004.10.025 [doi]']",ppublish,Gene. 2005 Feb 28;347(1):43-54. doi: 10.1016/j.gene.2004.10.025.

Examples of MIF4G/MA3 containing proteins and their functions include eIF4G, which serves as a scaffold for assembly of factors required for translation initiation, programmed cell death protein 4 (Pdcd4) that inhibits translation and functions as a tumor suppressor, and NMD2, which is essential for nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. MIF4G and MA3 domains serve as binding sites for one or more isoforms of the eIF4A family of ATP-dependent DEAD-box RNA helicases that are required for translation and for nonsense-mediated decay. In this report, we describe the characterization of a novel MIF4G/MA3 family member called NOM1 (nucleolar protein with MIF4G domain 1) that was identified at the chromosome 7q36 breakpoint involved in 7;12 translocations associated with certain acute leukemias of childhood. NOM1, which includes a previously described EST called c7orf3, encodes a ubiquitously expressed transcript composed of 11 exons and an approximately 3 kb 3' UTR that contains several Alu repeats. The predicted NOM1 protein contains one MIF4G domain and one MA3 domain and, consistent with data obtained with other MIF4G/MA3 proteins, interacts with members of the eIF4A family of helicases. Database searches reveal that NOM1 homologs exist in several organisms and that at least two of these are essential genes. Finally, like its Saccharomyces cerevisiae homolog Sgd1p, NOM1 localizes predominantly to the nucleolus. These data demonstrate that NOM1 is a new member of the MIF4G/MA3 family of proteins and suggest that it may provide an essential function in metazoans.","['Simmons, Heidi M', 'Ruis, Brian L', 'Kapoor, Meenal', 'Hudacek, Andrew W', 'Conklin, Kathleen F']","['Simmons HM', 'Ruis BL', 'Kapoor M', 'Hudacek AW', 'Conklin KF']","['Department of Biochemistry, Molecular Biology and Biophysics, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,Gene,Gene,7706761,"['0 (Codon, Nonsense)', '0 (Nom1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-4A)']",IM,"['Alu Elements/genetics/physiology', 'Apoptosis/genetics/physiology', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics/metabolism', 'Chromosome Breakage/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7/*genetics', 'Codon, Nonsense/genetics/metabolism', 'Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-4A/genetics/*metabolism', 'Exons/*genetics/physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/genetics/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Binding/genetics/physiology', 'RNA Stability/genetics/physiology', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic/genetics/physiology', 'Translocation, Genetic/genetics/physiology']",2005/02/18 09:00,2005/06/04 09:00,['2005/02/18 09:00'],"['2004/09/07 00:00 [received]', '2004/12/02 00:00 [revised]', '2004/12/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/02/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/04 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0378-1119(04)00774-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.gene.2004.12.027 [doi]']",ppublish,Gene. 2005 Feb 28;347(1):137-45. doi: 10.1016/j.gene.2004.12.027.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The latter cohort was used as a comparative group. Statistical analyses were performed using linear regressions. RESULTS: A strong correlation was demonstrated between SC and LBM in the patients with PMD (r = 0.77) and in patients with ALL (r = 0.83 at diagnosis; r = 0.77 on therapy; and r = 0.56 off therapy). The correlation between SC and body size (body mass index) was much weaker (r = 0.38; r = -0.09; r = 0.29 at the successive observations in the ALL cohort and r = 0.05 in the PMD cohort).

METHODS: The clinical records of all children who had a cancer relapse more than 3 months after the end of therapies in the period 1985-2000 were reviewed. Relapses were defined ""diagnosed at a scheduled visit"" or ""at an unscheduled visit"" based upon how the visit that lead to the suspected diagnosis was scheduled. Information was collected on how the first suspicion of relapse was made. Survival after relapse was calculated, by type of visit and tumor type. RESULTS: Among 739 children who completed therapy for a malignant tumor in first complete remission (CR), 101 relapses [74 after solid tumors (ST), 27 after leukemia/lymphoma (L)] occurred after a median time of 12 months (range 3-87). Fifty-one (50.5%) first relapses were diagnosed during a visit scheduled because of symptoms (36 ST, 15 L), and 50 relapses (49.5%) at a regularly scheduled visit (38 ST, 12 L). Overall, 75% of relapses were first suspected on clinical basis, 16% via imaging, and only 9% via lab tests. Survival more than 10 years from first relapse was 25.7% (SE: 0.05%), with no significant differences between relapses diagnosed at a scheduled visit (20.5%), or at an unscheduled visit (32.1%; P = 0.826). Children with L had a better overall survival (OS, 70.6%) as compared to those with ST (9.2%, P < 0.001), probably because of a more extensive use of stem cell transplantation (SCT) as part of the salvage regimens. CONCLUSIONS: Scheduled follow-up programs failed to detect relapses in 50% of cases presented here. Survival after relapse is not affected by whether relapse was detected at a scheduled or an unscheduled visit.","['Biasotti, Simona', 'Garaventa, Alberto', 'Padovani, Paola', 'Faraci, Maura', 'Fioredda, Francesca', 'Hanau, Guia', 'Grisolia, Francesca', 'Parodi, Stefano', 'Haupt, Riccardo']","['Biasotti S', 'Garaventa A', 'Padovani P', 'Faraci M', 'Fioredda F', 'Hanau G', 'Grisolia F', 'Parodi S', 'Haupt R']","[""Department of Hematology/Oncology, Gaslini Children's Hospital, Genoa, Italy.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Child', '*Follow-Up Studies', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/diagnosis/mortality/therapy', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*diagnosis/mortality/*therapy', 'Office Visits', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Statistics as Topic', 'Survival Analysis']",2005/02/17 09:00,2005/12/29 09:00,['2005/02/17 09:00'],"['2005/02/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/29 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/17 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.20356 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2005 Nov;45(6):781-6. doi: 10.1002/pbc.20356.,,,,,,,,,"['(c) 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,

However, as many patients achieve a final height between the 5th and the 95th centile, the true incidence of linear growth impairment might be underestimated. METHODS: Reduction of adult height (RAH) was estimated in adult childhood ALL survivors with and without cranial irradiation. RAH was calculated as the difference between target height (TH) and final height (FH). TH was calculated according to the formula TH = {[(height father + height mother +/- 12)/2] + 3}. RAH was assessed in 79 adult childhood ALL survivors in first complete remission who had received cranial irradiation 25 Gy (Group I, n = 53), 18 Gy (Group II, n = 10) or chemotherapy alone (controls, n = 16). RESULTS: RAH was 8.6 +/- 8.2 cm in Group I (P = 0.001 vs. controls), 6.2 +/- 3.2 cm in Group II (P = 0.01 vs. controls), and 1.7 +/- 4.6 in controls (chemotherapy only). There was no significant difference between Group I and Group II. In Group I females had more RAH than males (P = 0.02). RAH was related to younger age at diagnosis (P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The deficit between target height and final height highlights the reduction of adult height in the majority of male and female childhood ALL survivors who had received prophylactic cranial irradiation, in particular in those who were diagnosed at a younger age. This reduction would have been masked if patients FH was only compared with standard methods. RAH might be a sensitive predictor for growth hormone deficiency as these results suggest that radiation-induced growth hormone deficiency in these patients is the rule rather than the exception.","['Bongers, M E J', 'Francken, A B', 'Rouwe, C', 'Kamps, W A', 'Postma, A']","['Bongers ME', 'Francken AB', 'Rouwe C', 'Kamps WA', 'Postma A']","['Department of Pediatrics, Division of Pediatric Oncology, University of Groningen/University Hospital Groningen, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Body Height', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cranial Irradiation/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Growth Disorders/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Netherlands/epidemiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*radiotherapy', 'Statistics, Nonparametric']",2005/02/17 09:00,2005/09/02 09:00,['2005/02/17 09:00'],"['2005/02/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/02 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/17 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.20334 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2005 Aug;45(2):139-43. doi: 10.1002/pbc.20334.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fluoroquinolones had been shown to decrease the incidence of gram-negative bacteremia in cancer patients with neutropenia, yet it was thought that the emergence of resistance in Escherichia coli and other gram-negative bacteria may have caused a progressive lack of efficacy of fluoroquinolone prophylaxis. Epidemiologic surveillance of fluoroquinolone resistance of E. coli clinical isolates at our cancer center since 1992 showed a continuing influx of new clones not previously observed in the population of cancer patients, an increase in the number of cancer patients per year colonized and/or infected by fluoroquinolone-resistant E. coli (1992-1994, 10-16 patients; 1995-1997, 24-27 patients), and a resistance rate of >50% among E. coli bloodstream isolates of hematology-oncology patients. A 6-month fluoroquinolone prophylaxis discontinuation intervention trial in 1998 suggested that despite increasing resistance among E. coli isolates, fluoroquinolone prophylaxis in acute leukemia patients was still effective in the prevention of gram-negative bacteremia (incidence rates, 8% during the pre-intervention period vs. 20% after discontinuation; p<0.01). The resumption of fluoroquinolone prophylaxis in acute leukemia patients thereafter decreased the incidence of gram-negative bacteremia to the pre-intervention level (9%; p=0.03), while the proportion of in vitro fluoroquinolone resistance in E. coli bacteremia isolates again increased (from 15% during the intervention period to >50% in the post-intervention period). Relative rates of resistance thus were a poor indicator of the potential clinical benefits associated with fluoroquinolone prophylaxis in cancer patients.","['Kern, W V', 'Klose, K', 'Jellen-Ritter, A S', 'Oethinger, M', 'Bohnert, J', 'Kern, P', 'Reuter, S', 'von Baum, H', 'Marre, R']","['Kern WV', 'Klose K', 'Jellen-Ritter AS', 'Oethinger M', 'Bohnert J', 'Kern P', 'Reuter S', 'von Baum H', 'Marre R']","['Center for Infectious Diseases and Travel Medicine, Department of Medicine, University Hospital, Hugstetter Strasse 55, 79106 Freiburg, Germany. kern@if-freiburg.de']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Germany,Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis,European journal of clinical microbiology & infectious diseases : official publication of the European Society of Clinical Microbiology,8804297,"['0 (Anti-Infective Agents)', '0 (Fluoroquinolones)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Anti-Infective Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Antibiotic Prophylaxis', 'Cancer Care Facilities', '*Drug Resistance, Bacterial', 'Escherichia coli/classification/*drug effects/genetics', 'Escherichia coli Infections/epidemiology/microbiology/*prevention & control', 'Female', 'Fluoroquinolones/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia/*complications', 'Male', 'Microbial Sensitivity Tests', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutropenia/*complications']",2005/02/17 09:00,2005/05/04 09:00,['2005/02/17 09:00'],"['2005/02/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/05/04 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/17 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s10096-005-1278-x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis. 2005 Feb;24(2):111-8. doi: 10.1007/s10096-005-1278-x.,,,,,,,['Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis. 2005 Feb;24(2):109-10.

Because allicin was shown to be toxic to various mammalian cells in vitro, we devised a novel approach for the therapy of B-cell malignancies based on site-directed generation of allicin. Alliinase was conjugated to the monoclonal antibody rituximab, which recognizes the CD20 antigen, and the resulting conjugate was targeted to CD20+ B chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) and other B-cell lymphomas. Upon addition of alliin, allicin was formed in situ, killing the CD20+ tumor B cells via apoptosis. Following a 72-hour treatment, an 85% and 96% reduction was observed in the number of viable B-CLL and EBV-transformed B cells, respectively. Using the human/mouse radiation chimera for the evaluation of allicin targeting in a preclinical animal model, we showed a significant reduction in the number of recovered B-CLL, mantle cell lymphoma, or EBV-transformed B cells. We conclude that our system offers a new powerful and less toxic therapy for B-CLL and other B-cell malignancies. Furthermore, combining alliinase with the appropriate monoclonal antibody may extend the application of this approach to other conditions in which the elimination of a specific cell population is desired.","['Arditti, Fabian D', 'Rabinkov, Aharon', 'Miron, Talia', 'Reisner, Yair', 'Berrebi, Alain', 'Wilchek, Meir', 'Mirelman, David']","['Arditti FD', 'Rabinkov A', 'Miron T', 'Reisner Y', 'Berrebi A', 'Wilchek M', 'Mirelman D']","['Department of Biological Chemistry, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot 76100, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Antigens, CD20)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Disulfides)', '0 (Immunotoxins)', '0 (Sulfinic Acids)', '0 (rituximab-alliinase conjugate)', '3C39BY17Y6 (allicin)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', 'EC 4.4.- (Carbon-Sulfur Lyases)', 'EC 4.4.1.4 (alliin lyase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/chemistry/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived', 'Antigens, CD20/immunology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', '*Apoptosis', 'Carbon-Sulfur Lyases/chemistry/*therapeutic use', 'Chimera', 'Disulfides', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Immunotoxins/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Rituximab', 'Sulfinic Acids/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2005/02/17 09:00,2005/07/29 09:00,['2005/02/17 09:00'],"['2005/02/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/29 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/17 09:00 [entrez]']",['4/2/325 [pii]'],ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2005 Feb;4(2):325-31.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Deletion of the coiled-coil domain of EML1 abrogated the transforming properties of the fusion kinase.

In contrast, no such complications or MDR1-associated alterations of hematopoiesis were observed in numerous other studies exploring MDR1 gene transfer into cell lines, mice, dogs, nonhuman primates, and human subjects. Here, we show that leukemias associated with retroviral expression of MDR1 depend on high vector dose, and involve the selection of clones with combinatorial insertional mutagenesis of proto-oncogenes or other signaling genes. Compared with insertion patterns in normal long-term repopulating hematopoietic cells, such hits were overrepresented in leukemic clones, pointing to a causal role. A similar constellation of insertion sites was also observed in a leukemia arising after high-copy retroviral gene transfer of a fluorescent protein.

AML1/Runx1 and 2 closely related family genes, AML2/Runx3 and AML3/Runx2/Cbfa1, present in mammals, comprise the Runt-domain transcription factor family. Although they have similar structural and biochemical properties, gene-targeting experiments have identified distinct biologic roles. To directly determine the presence of functional overlap among runt-related transcription factor (Runx) family molecules, we replaced the C-terminal portion of acute myeloid leukemia 1 (AML1) with that derived from its family members, which are variable in contrast to conserved Runt domain, using the gene knock-in method. We found that C-terminal portions of either AML2 or AML3 could functionally replace that of AML1 for myeloid development in culture and within the entire mouse. However, while AML2 substituted for AML1 could effectively rescue lymphoid lineages, AML3 could not, resulting in a smaller thymus and lymphoid deficiency in peripheral blood. Substitution by the C-terminal portion of AML3 also led to high infantile mortality and growth retardation, suggesting that AML1 has as yet unidentified effects on these phenotypes. Thus, the C-terminal portions of Runx family members have both similar and distinct biologic functions.","['Fukushima-Nakase, Yoko', 'Naoe, Yoshinori', 'Taniuchi, Ichiro', 'Hosoi, Hajime', 'Sugimoto, Tohru', 'Okuda, Tsukasa']","['Fukushima-Nakase Y', 'Naoe Y', 'Taniuchi I', 'Hosoi H', 'Sugimoto T', 'Okuda T']","['Department of Molecular-Targeting Cancer Prevention, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, Graduate School of Medical Science, Kawaramachi-Hirokoji, Kamigyo-ku, Kyoto 602-8566, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20050215,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 1 Subunit)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 3 Subunit)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Runx1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Runx2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Runx3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-2)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blood Cells', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chimera/growth & development', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 1 Subunit', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 3 Subunit', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Growth and Development', 'Lymphocytes/cytology', 'Mice', 'Myeloid Cells/cytology', 'Protein Engineering', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Thymus Gland/growth & development', 'Transcription Factor AP-2', 'Transcription Factors/chemistry/*physiology']",2005/02/17 09:00,2005/07/13 09:00,['2005/02/17 09:00'],"['2005/02/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)53468-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2004-08-3372 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2005 Jun 1;105(11):4298-307. doi: 10.1182/blood-2004-08-3372.

The newly identified GrB-mediated mitochondrial cascade was initiated by the cleavage and subsequent degradation of Mcl-1, resulting in the release of mitochondrial Bim from Mcl-1 sequestration. To investigate the biological significance of Mcl-1 cleavage by GrB, we mapped the major GrB cleavage sites and evaluated the apoptotic potential of the cleavage products. GrB cleaves Mcl-1 after aspartic acid residues 117, 127, and 157, generating C-terminal fragments that all contain BH-1, BH-2, BH-3, and transmembrane domains. These fragments accumulate at an early apoptotic phase but are eliminated by further degradation during the apoptotic process. The major Mcl-1 C-terminal fragment generated by GrB (residues 118-350) was unable to induce or enhance apoptosis when transfected into tumor cells. Instead, this Mcl-1 C-terminal fragment maintained a partial protective capability against GrB-mediated apoptosis via its lower affinity to Bim. In comparison with ectopically expressed full-length Mcl-1, the stably transfected C-terminal fragments of Mcl-1 were less efficiently localized to the mitochondria. Knockdown of Mcl-1, as achieved by transfection with Mcl-1-specific short interfering RNA, resulted in a significant level of apoptosis in the absence of external apoptotic stimulation and, in addition, enhanced the susceptibility of breast carcinoma cells to GrB cytotoxicity. The significance of Bim in this GrB apoptotic cascade was indicated by the marked protection against GrB-mediated apoptosis endowed on these cells through Bim knockdown. Our studies suggest that the disruption of the Mcl-1.Bim complex by GrB initiates a major Bim-mediated cellular cytotoxic mechanism that requires the elimination of Mcl-1 following its initial cleavage.","['Han, Jie', 'Goldstein, Leslie A', 'Gastman, Brian R', 'Rabinovitz, Asaf', 'Rabinowich, Hannah']","['Han J', 'Goldstein LA', 'Gastman BR', 'Rabinovitz A', 'Rabinowich H']","['Department of Pathology, the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15213, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",20050215,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BCL2L11 protein, human)', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Mitochondrial Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (GZMB protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Granzymes)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Serine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11', 'Breast Neoplasms/enzymology', 'Carcinoma/enzymology', 'Carrier Proteins/*metabolism', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Granzymes', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Membrane Proteins/*metabolism', 'Mitochondria/*enzymology/metabolism', 'Mitochondrial Proteins/metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'Serine Endopeptidases/*metabolism']",2005/02/17 09:00,2005/06/24 09:00,['2005/02/17 09:00'],"['2005/02/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/24 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(20)69322-X [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M411377200 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2005 Apr 22;280(16):16383-92. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M411377200.

The development of leukemia in Ikaros null mice suggests that Ikaros has the characteristics of a tumor suppressor gene. In this report, we show that the introduction of Ikaros into an established mouse Ikaros null T leukemia cell line leads to growth arrest at the G0/G1 stage of the cell cycle. This arrest is associated with up-regulation of the cell cycle-dependent kinase inhibitor p27kip1, the induction of expression of T-cell differentiation markers, and a global and specific increase in histone H3 acetylation status.

Transfection of T cells with human T-cell leukemia type 1 or 2 transactivator results in the induction of the T-cell-restricted cytokine interleukin-2 (IL-2) and its receptor (IL-2Ralpha). However, no T-cell-specific factor(s) has been directly linked with the regulation of IL-2 and IL-2Ralpha transcription by influencing the promoter activity. Thymocytes from SATB1 (special AT-rich sequence binding protein 1) knockout mice have been shown to ectopically express IL-2Ralpha, suggesting involvement of SATB1 in its negative regulation. Here we show that SATB1, a T-cell-specific global gene regulator, binds to the promoters of human IL-2 and IL-2Ralpha and recruits histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) in vivo. SATB1 also interacts with Tat in HIV-1-infected T cells. The functional interaction between HIV-1 Tat and SATB1 requires its PDZ-like domain, and the binding of the HDAC1 corepressor occurs through the same. Furthermore, Tat competitively displaces HDAC1 that is bound to SATB1, leading to increased acetylation of the promoters in vivo. Transduction with SATB1 interaction-deficient soluble Tat (Tat 40-72) and reporter assays using a transactivation-negative mutant (C22G) of Tat unequivocally demonstrated that the displacement of HDAC1 itself is sufficient for derepression of these promoters in vivo. These results suggest a novel mechanism by which HIV-1 Tat might overcome SATB1-mediated repression in T cells.","['Kumar, P Pavan', 'Purbey, Prabhat Kumar', 'Ravi, Dyavar S', 'Mitra, Debashis', 'Galande, Sanjeev']","['Kumar PP', 'Purbey PK', 'Ravi DS', 'Mitra D', 'Galande S']","['National Centre for Cell Science, NCCS Complex, Ganeshkhind, Pune 411007, India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Gene Products, tat)', '0 (IL2RA protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Interleukin-2 Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Matrix Attachment Region Binding Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (SATB1 protein, human)', '0 (tat Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (HDAC1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylase 1)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)']",IM,"['Acetylation', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Cell Line', 'Down-Regulation/genetics', 'Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay', 'Gene Products, tat/genetics/*metabolism', '*HIV-1', 'Histone Deacetylase 1', 'Histone Deacetylases/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Interleukin-2 Receptor alpha Subunit', 'Matrix Attachment Region Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Protein Transport', 'Receptors, Interleukin/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Repressor Proteins/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/*virology', 'Transfection', 'Two-Hybrid System Techniques', 'Up-Regulation/genetics', 'tat Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus']",2005/02/17 09:00,2005/03/29 09:00,['2005/02/17 09:00'],"['2005/02/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/29 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['25/5/1620 [pii]', '10.1128/MCB.25.5.1620-1633.2005 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2005 Mar;25(5):1620-33. doi: 10.1128/MCB.25.5.1620-1633.2005.,,,,,PMC549366,,,,,,,,,,,,

This necessitated a third revision of the 1996 International Classification of Childhood Cancer (ICCC-3). METHODS: The tumor categories for the ICCC-3 were designed to respect several principles: agreement with current international standards, integration of the entities defined by newly developed diagnostic techniques, continuity with previous childhood classifications, and exhaustiveness. RESULTS: The ICCC-3 classifies tumors coded according to the ICD-O-3 into 12 main groups, which are split further into 47 subgroups. These 2 levels of the ICCC-3 allow standardized comparisons of the broad categories of childhood neoplasms in continuity with the previous classifications. The 16 most heterogeneous subgroups are broken down further into 2-11 divisions to allow study of important entities or homogeneous collections of tumors characterized at the cytogenetic or molecular level. Some divisions may be combined across the higher-level categories, such as the B-cell neoplasms within leukemias and lymphomas. CONCLUSIONS: The ICCC-3 respects currently existing international standards and was designed for use in international, population-based, epidemiological studies and cancer registries. The use of an international classification system is especially important in the field of pediatric oncology, in which the low frequency of cases requires rigorous procedures to ensure data comparability.","['Steliarova-Foucher, Eva', 'Stiller, Charles', 'Lacour, Brigitte', 'Kaatsch, Peter']","['Steliarova-Foucher E', 'Stiller C', 'Lacour B', 'Kaatsch P']","['International Agency for Research on Cancer, Lyon, France. steliarova@iarc.fr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Brain Neoplasms/classification', 'Child', 'Humans', 'International Classification of Diseases', 'Leukemia/classification', 'Lymphoma/classification', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/classification', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/classification', 'Neoplasms/*classification', 'Registries', 'Spinal Neoplasms/classification']",2005/02/16 09:00,2005/05/06 09:00,['2005/02/16 09:00'],"['2005/02/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/05/06 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/16 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.20910 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2005 Apr 1;103(7):1457-67. doi: 10.1002/cncr.20910.,,,,,,,,,['Copyright 2005 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,,,

Oncostatin M (OSM), an IL-6-type cytokine, affects the growth of prostate cancers in a paracrine and autocrine manner. In order to understand better the mechanisms controlling proliferation and intracellular signaling by these cytokines in advanced prostate carcinoma, we performed studies in 22Rv1 cells derived from the relapsed xenograft CWR22R. METHODS: Expression of IL-6 and OSM receptors (OSMR-beta) and elements of signal transduction pathways in 22Rv1 cells were investigated by RT-PCR. Proliferation was assessed by cell counting after treatment with either IL-6 or OSM. IL-6 secretion was measured in conditioned medium from 22Rv1 cells by ELISA. Expression and phosphorylation status of signal transducers and activators of transcription factor (STAT) 3, mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) p44/p42 and p38, and protein kinase B (Akt) was investigated by Western blot. RESULTS: 22Rv1 cells express both subunits of the IL-6 receptor (gp80 and gp130) and leukemia inhibitory factor receptor-beta (LIFR-beta) but not OSMR-beta. Their proliferation was stimulated by IL-6 or OSM and the maximal effect was observed at a concentration of 10 ng/ml of either cytokine. Interestingly, neither IL-6 nor OSM induced phosphorylation of STAT3. OSM modestly increased the phosphorylation of p38 and both cytokines exerted an effect on Akt phosphorylation. CONCLUSIONS: IL-6 and OSM stimulate proliferation of 22Rv1 cells, at least in part through activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-K) signaling pathway. Our data provide additional evidence for the growth-stimulatory role of IL-6 and related cytokines in advanced prostate cancer and may serve as a basis for the development of novel experimental therapies.","['Godoy-Tundidor, Sonia', 'Cavarretta, Ilaria T R', 'Fuchs, Dietmar', 'Fiechtl, Matthias', 'Steiner, Hannes', 'Friedbichler, Katrin', 'Bartsch, Georg', 'Hobisch, Alfred', 'Culig, Zoran']","['Godoy-Tundidor S', 'Cavarretta IT', 'Fuchs D', 'Fiechtl M', 'Steiner H', 'Friedbichler K', 'Bartsch G', 'Hobisch A', 'Culig Z']","['Department of Urology, Innsbruck Medical University, Innsbruck, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Prostate,The Prostate,8101368,"['0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (OSM protein, human)', '0 (Peptides)', '106956-32-5 (Oncostatin M)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/*physiology', 'Male', 'Oncostatin M', 'Peptides/*physiology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*physiology', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/*physiopathology', 'Signal Transduction/physiology', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*physiology']",2005/02/16 09:00,2005/07/16 09:00,['2005/02/16 09:00'],"['2005/02/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/16 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/16 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pros.20235 [doi]'],ppublish,Prostate. 2005 Jul 1;64(2):209-16. doi: 10.1002/pros.20235.,,,,,,,,,"['(c) 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,

To establish the incidence and spectrum of malformation syndromes associated with childhood cancer we performed a clinical morphological examination on a series of 1,073 children with cancer. We diagnosed a syndrome in 42 patients (3.9%) and suspected the presence of a syndrome in another 35 patients (3.3%), for a total of 7.2%. This incidence of patients with a proven or suspected syndrome is high, and points to a possible association. We describe new syndrome-tumor associations in several entities: cleidocranial dysostosis (Wilms tumor), Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) (acute lymphoblastic leukemia), Kabuki syndrome (neuroblastoma), LEOPARD syndrome (neuroblastoma), Poland anomaly (osteosarcoma; Hodgkin disease), and blepharophimosis epicanthus inversus syndrome (Burkitt lymphoma). Twenty of the 42 syndrome diagnoses were not recognized in the patients prior to this study, indicating that these diagnoses are commonly missed.

We examined normal human peripheral blood B cells, secondary lymphoid tissue, and a range of human B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders for the expression of B220 by flow cytometric immunophenotyping and immunohistochemical staining. We found that a subset of human B cells in peripheral blood is positive for B220 by flow cytometric immunophenotypic analysis. In reactive lymphoid tissues, B220 is expressed by B cells occupying the mantle zones and by a subpopulation of germinal center cells, but, in contrast, marginal zone B cells in the spleen do not express B220. Of 94 cases of B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders, 33 (35%) were positive for B220 by flow cytometric immunophenotypic analysis, including most cases of marginal zone lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, and lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma. In contrast, all cases of precursor B lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma were negative for B220. Immunohistochemical staining for B220 correlated with flow cytometric analysis for all cases studied by both methods. Our data demonstrate that B220 is expressed in a select subset of normal, reactive B cells in a pattern that is consistent with a marker of naive B cells. However, this restricted expression pattern is not seen in B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders. Discordance between the B220 expression patterns of normal mantle and marginal zone B cells and their respective neoplastic counterparts may aid in the distinction between normal and neoplastic proliferations at these anatomical sites.","['Rodig, Scott J', 'Shahsafaei, Aliakbar', 'Li, Betty', 'Dorfman, David M']","['Rodig SJ', 'Shahsafaei A', 'Li B', 'Dorfman DM']","[""Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA 02115, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Hum Pathol,Human pathology,9421547,"['0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily, Member 7)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/immunology/*metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens/immunology/*metabolism', 'Lymphocyte Subsets/immunology/*metabolism', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/immunology/*metabolism', 'Palatine Tonsil', 'Protein Isoforms/immunology/*metabolism', 'Spleen', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily, Member 7/immunology/metabolism']",2005/02/16 09:00,2005/04/01 09:00,['2005/02/16 09:00'],"['2005/02/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/01 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0046817704006161 [pii]', '10.1016/j.humpath.2004.10.016 [doi]']",ppublish,Hum Pathol. 2005 Jan;36(1):51-7. doi: 10.1016/j.humpath.2004.10.016.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These studies can lead to the identification of diagnostic genes, classification of genes into functional categories, association of genes with regulatory pathways, and clustering of genes into modules that are potentially co-regulated by a group of transcription factors. Traditional clustering methods such as hierarchical clustering or principal component analysis are difficult to deploy effectively for several of these tasks since genes rarely exhibit similar expression pattern across a wide range of conditions. Bi-clustering of gene expression data is a promising methodology for identification of gene groups that show a coherent expression profile across a subset of conditions. This methodology can be a first step towards the discovery of co-regulated and co-expressed genes or modules. Although bi-clustering (also called block clustering) was introduced in statistics in 1974 few robust and efficient solutions exist for extracting gene expression modules in microarray data. In this paper, we propose a simple but promising new approach for bi-clustering based on a Gibbs sampling paradigm. Our algorithm is implemented in the program GEMS (Gene Expression Module Sampler). GEMS has been tested on synthetic data generated to evaluate the effect of noise on the performance of the algorithm as well as on published leukemia datasets. In our preliminary studies comparing GEMS with other bi-clustering software we show that GEMS is a reliable, flexible and computationally efficient approach for bi-clustering gene expression data.","['Wu, Chang-Jiun', 'Fu, Yutao', 'Murali, T M', 'Kasif, Simon']","['Wu CJ', 'Fu Y', 'Murali TM', 'Kasif S']","['Boston University Bioinformatics Program, Boston, MA 02215, USA. terrence@bu.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,Japan,Genome Inform,Genome informatics.

However, evidence for various forms of clonal evolution suggests that B-CLL clones may be more dynamic than previously assumed. We used a nonradioactive, stable isotopic labeling method to measure B-CLL cell kinetics in vivo. Nineteen patients drank an aliquot of deuterated water (2H2O) daily for 84 days, and 2H incorporation into the deoxyribose moiety of DNA of newly divided B-CLL cells was measured by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, during and after the labeling period. Birth rates were calculated from the kinetic profiles. Death rates were defined as the difference between calculated birth and growth rates. These analyses demonstrated that the leukemic cells of each patient had definable and often substantial birth rates, varying from 0.1% to greater than 1.0% of the entire clone per day. Those patients with birth rates greater than 0.35% per day were much more likely to exhibit active or to develop progressive disease than those with lower birth rates Thus, B-CLL is not a static disease that results simply from accumulation of long-lived lymphocytes. Rather, it is a dynamic process composed also of cells that proliferate and die, often at appreciable levels. The extent to which this turnover occurs has not been previously appreciated. A correlation between birth rates and disease activity and progression appears to exist, which may help identify patients at risk for worsening disease in advance of clinical deterioration.","['Messmer, Bradley T', 'Messmer, Davorka', 'Allen, Steven L', 'Kolitz, Jonathan E', 'Kudalkar, Prasad', 'Cesar, Denise', 'Murphy, Elizabeth J', 'Koduru, Prasad', 'Ferrarini, Manlio', 'Zupo, Simona', 'Cutrona, Giovanna', 'Damle, Rajendra N', 'Wasil, Tarun', 'Rai, Kanti R', 'Hellerstein, Marc K', 'Chiorazzi, Nicholas']","['Messmer BT', 'Messmer D', 'Allen SL', 'Kolitz JE', 'Kudalkar P', 'Cesar D', 'Murphy EJ', 'Koduru P', 'Ferrarini M', 'Zupo S', 'Cutrona G', 'Damle RN', 'Wasil T', 'Rai KR', 'Hellerstein MK', 'Chiorazzi N']","['Institute for Medical Research, North Shore-LIJ Research Institute, Manhasset, New York 11030, USA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['059QF0KO0R (Water)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'AR09D82C7G (Deuterium)']",IM,"['Aged', 'B-Lymphocytes/*cytology/*metabolism', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Separation', 'DNA/metabolism', 'Deuterium/metabolism', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/*metabolism/pathology/physiopathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Models, Biological', 'Water/chemistry']",2005/02/16 09:00,2005/05/10 09:00,['2005/02/16 09:00'],"['2004/09/20 00:00 [received]', '2004/12/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/02/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/05/10 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/16 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1172/JCI23409 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Invest. 2005 Mar;115(3):755-64. doi: 10.1172/JCI23409.,,,,"['R01 CA087956/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA81554/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'M01 RR018535/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA081554/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA87956/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC548318,,,,,,,,,,,,

We compared an intensified regimen of etoposide (60 mg/kg), busulphan (14 mg/kg), and cyclophosphamide (120 mg/kg) (BuCyVP) with BuCy2 in 237 AML patients. No significant difference in overall outcome was observed following BuCyVP (n=127) or BuCy2 (n=110). The 5-year survival was 27.3 and 30.1% following BuCyVP and BuCy2, respectively (P=0.48). Similarly, the 5-year cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) was 28.3 and 34.8% with BuCyVP and BuCy2 (P=0.45), respectively. On multivariable analysis, patients transplanted in CR1 (P=0.002) and from related donors (P=0.013) had longer survival, while disease status at transplant was the only factor predicting CIR (P=0.002). In a separate analysis of CR1 patients (n=56), there was no significant difference in survival (P=0.37) or CIR (P=0.87) between the two regimens. However, for more advanced disease, there was a trend towards less relapse with BuCyVP (P=0.08), which was balanced by a higher cumulative incidence of transplant-related deaths (P=0.03) compared to BuCy2, resulting in similar survival. Overall, our results do not support the use of the more intensive BuCyVP regimen over BuCy2 in either early or more advanced disease AML patients.","['Farag, S S', 'Bolwell, B J', 'Elder, P J', 'Kalaycio, M', 'Lin, T', 'Pohlman, B', 'Penza, S', 'Marcucci, G', 'Blum, W', 'Sobecks, R', 'Avalos, B R', 'Byrd, J C', 'Copelan, E']","['Farag SS', 'Bolwell BJ', 'Elder PJ', 'Kalaycio M', 'Lin T', 'Pohlman B', 'Penza S', 'Marcucci G', 'Blum W', 'Sobecks R', 'Avalos BR', 'Byrd JC', 'Copelan E']","['Hematologic Malignancies Program, The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH, USA. farag-1@medctr.osu.edu']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Controlled Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",,England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,"['6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage/toxicity', 'Busulfan/administration & dosage', 'Cause of Death', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/complications/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",2005/02/16 09:00,2005/08/20 09:00,['2005/02/16 09:00'],"['2005/02/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/20 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['1704867 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.bmt.1704867 [doi]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2005 Apr;35(7):653-61. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1704867.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The potent inhibitor of DNA methylation and antileukemic agent, 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-AZA-CdR, Decitabine), can reactivate silent tumor suppressor genes. One hindrance to the curative potential of 5-AZA-CdR is its rapid in vivo inactivation by cytidine deaminase (CD). An approach to overcome this obstacle is to use 5-AZA-CdR in combination with zebularine (Zeb), a potent inhibitor of CD. Zeb also possesses independent antineoplastic activity due to its inhibition of DNA methylation. We tested the capacity of 5-AZA-CdR and Zeb alone and in combination to inhibit growth and colony formation of different leukemic cell lines. 5-AZA-CdR and Zeb in combination produced a greater inhibition of growth against murine L1210 lymphoid leukemic cells, and a greater reduction in colony formation by L1210 and human HL-60 myeloid leukemic cells, than either agent alone. The ability of these agents to reactivate the tumor suppressor gene, p57KIP2, was also tested using RT-PCR. The combination produced a synergistic reactivation of p57KIP2 in HL-60 leukemic cells. A methylation-specific PCR assay showed that this combination also induced a significantly greater demethylation level of the p57KIP2 promoter than either drug alone. The in vivo antineoplastic activity of the agents was evaluated in mice with L1210 leukemia. A greater increase in survival time of mice with L1210 leukemia was observed with the combination than with either agent alone using three different dose schedules. The enhanced activity observed with 5-AZA-CdR plus Zeb in both murine and human leukemic cells lines provides a rationale for the clinical investigation of these drugs in patients with advanced leukemia. The probable mechanism of this drug interaction involves inhibition of CD by Zeb and the complementary inhibition of DNA methylation by both agents.","['Lemaire, Maryse', 'Momparler, Louise F', 'Bernstein, Mark L', 'Marquez, Victor E', 'Momparler, Richard L']","['Lemaire M', 'Momparler LF', 'Bernstein ML', 'Marquez VE', 'Momparler RL']","['Departement de Pharmacologie, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Anticancer Drugs,Anti-cancer drugs,9100823,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Pyrimidine Nucleosides)', '5CSZ8459RP (Cytidine)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', '7A9Y5SX0GY (pyrimidin-2-one beta-ribofuranoside)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (Cytidine Deaminase)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*therapeutic use', 'Azacitidine/*analogs & derivatives/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytidine/analogs & derivatives', 'Cytidine Deaminase/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'DNA Methylation/drug effects', 'Decitabine', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Interactions', 'Humans', 'Leukemia L1210/*drug therapy/enzymology/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Pyrimidine Nucleosides/*pharmacology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",2005/02/16 09:00,2005/05/25 09:00,['2005/02/16 09:00'],"['2005/02/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/05/25 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['00001813-200503000-00009 [pii]', '10.1097/00001813-200503000-00009 [doi]']",ppublish,Anticancer Drugs. 2005 Mar;16(3):301-8. doi: 10.1097/00001813-200503000-00009.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Up to 14 standard drugs were evaluated in samples from 66 patients with B-CLL, 212 patients with AML and 80 patients with ALL. B-CLL cells were found to be more sensitive than cells from both AML and ALL to cytarabine, cladribine, fludarabine, doxorubicin, idarubicin, vincristine and cyclophosphamide (p<0.05). No difference in cellular drug resistance was found between B-CLL and ALL cells for prednisolone, whereas AML cells were more resistant (p<0.0001). In B-CLL, cells from patients who had received previous chemotherapy were more resistant to almost all tested drugs as compared to cells from treatment-naive patients. In AML and ALL, in vitro drug resistance was not related to previous chemotherapy.

The aim of this study was to assess the rate of these complications in subjects receiving currently recommended treatments. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Overall, 1,638 patients from 12 countries were enrolled onto a large, prospective multicenter project aimed at describing the clinical history of polycythemia vera for the following outcomes: survival, the cumulative rate of cardiovascular death and thrombosis, the cumulative rate of leukemia, myelodysplasia, and myelofibrosis. The mean duration of the disease at entry and the duration of the follow-up were 4.9 and 2.7 years, respectively. RESULTS: The overall mortality rate of 3.7 deaths per 100 persons per year resulted from a moderate risk of cardiovascular death and a high risk of death from noncardiovascular causes (mainly hematologic transformations). Age older than 65 years and a positive history of thrombosis were the most important predictors of cardiovascular events. Antiplatelet therapy, but not cytoreductive treatment, was significantly associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular events. We found a consistent association between age and risk of leukemia, and between duration of the disease with risk of myelofibrosis. CONCLUSION: The European Collaboration on Low-Dose Aspirin in Polycythemia Vera study documents that large international collaborative studies are feasible in this field, in which few epidemiologic data are available. The persistently high mortality rate from hematologic malignancies characterizes the unmet therapeutic need of polycythemic patients and suggests a priority for future studies in this disease.","['Marchioli, Roberto', 'Finazzi, Guido', 'Landolfi, Raffaele', 'Kutti, Jack', 'Gisslinger, Heinz', 'Patrono, Carlo', 'Marilus, Raphael', 'Villegas, Ana', 'Tognoni, Gianni', 'Barbui, Tiziano']","['Marchioli R', 'Finazzi G', 'Landolfi R', 'Kutti J', 'Gisslinger H', 'Patrono C', 'Marilus R', 'Villegas A', 'Tognoni G', 'Barbui T']","['European Collaboration on Low-Dose Aspirin in Polycythemia Vera Coordinating Centre, Consorzio Mario Negri Sud, Via Nazionale, 66030 Santa Maria Imbaro, Italy. marchioli@negrisud.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20050214,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,"['Aged', 'Cardiovascular Diseases/*etiology/*mortality', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*etiology/*mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polycythemia Vera/*complications/*therapy', 'Prospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Analysis', 'Thrombosis/*etiology/*mortality', 'Time Factors']",2005/02/16 09:00,2005/04/22 09:00,['2005/02/16 09:00'],"['2005/02/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/22 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['JCO.2005.07.062 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2005.07.062 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2005 Apr 1;23(10):2224-32. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2005.07.062.

The decision of whether to offer a patient a hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) must be based on the probability of success of the procedure. The aim of this retrospective analysis of 1,084 CML patients who received an allogeneic HSCT in 10 Brazilian Centers between February 1983 and March 2003 was to validate the EBMT risk score. DESIGN AND METHODS: The study population comprised 647 (60%) males and 437 (40%) females, with a median age of 32 years old (range 1 - 59); 898 (83%) were in chronic phase, 146 (13%) were in accelerated phase and 40 (4%) were in blast crisis; 151 (14%) were younger than 20 years old, 620 (57%) were between 20 and 40 and 313 (29%) were older than 40; 1,025 (94%) received an HLA fully matched sibling transplant and only 59 (6%) received an unrelated transplant. In 283 cases (26%) a male recipient received a graft from a female donor. The interval from diagnosis to transplantation was less than 12 months in 223 (21%) cases and greater in 861 (79%). The overall survival, disease-free survival, transplant-related mortality and relapse incidence were 49%, 50%, 45% and 25%, respectively. RESULTS: Of the 1084 patients, 179 (17%) had a risk score of 0 or 1, 397 (37%) had a score of 2, 345 (32%) had a score of 3, 135 (12%) had a score of 4 and 28 (2%) a score of 5 or 6. The overall survival (OS) rate in patients with risk scores 0-1 and 2 was similar (58% and 55%, respectively) but significantly better than that in patients with scores 3 or more (score 3 - 44%, 4 - 36 % and 5-6 - 27%, respectively) pp<0.001). Disease-free survival (DFS) and transplant related mortality (TRM) in a patients with a score of 3 or more were 46% and 49%, respectively and the relapse rate beyond score 5-6 was 77%. Disease status had a negative impact on all outcomes (OS, DFS, TRM, and relapse). The OS rate for male recipients of a graft from a female donor was 40% compared to 52% among the other donor-recipient pairs (p=0.004). DFS and TRM were significant for disease phase and female donor-male recipient (p<0.001 and p<0.003, respectively). In our experience, age and interval between diagnosis and transplant did influence OS, DFS, TRM, and relapse rate. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Our results validate the EBMT risk score in the context of a developing country and confirm its usefulness for making point decisions in the imatinib era.","['De Souza, Carmino Antonio', 'Vigorito, Afonso Celso', 'Ruiz, Milton Artur', 'Nucci, Marcio', 'Dulley, Frederico Luiz', 'Funcke, Vaneusa', 'Tabak, Daniel', 'Azevedo, Alexandre Mello', 'Byington, Rita', 'Macedo, Maria Cristina', 'Saboya, Rosaura', 'Penteado Aranha, Francisco Jose', 'Oliveira, Gislaine Barbosa', 'Zulli, Roberto', 'Martins Miranda, Eliana Cristina', 'Azevedo, Wellington Moraes', 'Lodi, Fernanda Maria', 'Voltarelli, Julio Cesar', 'Simoes, Belinda Pinto', 'Colturato, Vergilio', 'De Souza, Mair Pedro', 'Silla, Lucia', 'Bittencourt, Henrique', 'Piron-Ruiz, Lilian', 'Maiolino, Angelo', 'Gratwohl, Alois', 'Pasquini, Ricardo']","['De Souza CA', 'Vigorito AC', 'Ruiz MA', 'Nucci M', 'Dulley FL', 'Funcke V', 'Tabak D', 'Azevedo AM', 'Byington R', 'Macedo MC', 'Saboya R', 'Penteado Aranha FJ', 'Oliveira GB', 'Zulli R', 'Martins Miranda EC', 'Azevedo WM', 'Lodi FM', 'Voltarelli JC', 'Simoes BP', 'Colturato V', 'De Souza MP', 'Silla L', 'Bittencourt H', 'Piron-Ruiz L', 'Maiolino A', 'Gratwohl A', 'Pasquini R']","['State University of Campinas-SP, Brazil. carmino@unicamp.br']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Brazil', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*diagnosis/pathology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Sex Factors', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",2005/02/16 09:00,2006/08/10 09:00,['2005/02/16 09:00'],"['2005/02/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/10 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/16 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 2005 Feb;90(2):232-7.,,,,,,,['Haematologica. 2005 Feb;90(2):151.

DESIGN AND METHODS: To assess the diagnostic value of molecular cytogenetics in AML patients older than 60 years, we compared the results of chromosome banding with those of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) applying a comprehensive DNA-probe set for the detection of the most relevant AML-associated chromosome aberrations in a prospective series of 283 patients registered for the multicenter treatment trial AML HD98-B. RESULTS: Four cases of inv(16)/t(16;16) and 2 cases of t(11q23) were only detected by FISH. Molecular cytogenetic analysis was also more sensitive for the detection of genomic imbalances, in particular 7q-, +11q, 17p-, and 20q-, but virtually all cases of aneuploidy or deletions that were missed on banding analysis were identified in patients without assessable metaphases, in patients with normal karyotypes but poor chromosome morphology, in patients with a leukemia-specific balanced rearrangement, or in patients with complex karyotypes. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the use of FISH as a complementary method for the detection of inv(16)/t(16;16) and t(11q23) in all older AML patients eligible for intensive therapy. Molecular cytogenetics should also be considered in cases with insufficient yields of metaphase cells, poor chromosome morphology, or both.

Traditional Chinese medicine is a rich source of potential anticancer agents. In particular, cantharidin (CAN), the active principle ingredient from the blister beetle, Mylabris, has anti-tumor activity, but the cytotoxic mechanism is unknown. In leukemia cells, cantharidin induces apoptosis by a p53-dependent mechanism. Cantharidin causes both DNA single- and double-strand breaks. Colony-forming assays with knockout and transfectant cells lines showed that DNA polymerase beta, but not ERCC1, conferred increased cell survival after cantharidin treatment, indicating that base excision repair (BER), rather than nucleotide excision repair (NER), is important for CAN-induced DNA lesions. Oxidative stress-resistant thymic lymphoma-derived WEHI7.2 variants are also more resistant to cantharidin. These data suggest that cantharidin treatment causes oxidative stress that provokes DNA damage and p53-dependent apoptosis.","['Efferth, Thomas', 'Rauh, Rolf', 'Kahl, Stefan', 'Tomicic, Maja', 'Bochzelt, Herbert', 'Tome, Margaret E', 'Briehl, Margaret M', 'Bauer, Rudolf', 'Kaina, Bernd']","['Efferth T', 'Rauh R', 'Kahl S', 'Tomicic M', 'Bochzelt H', 'Tome ME', 'Briehl MM', 'Bauer R', 'Kaina B']","['German Cancer Research Center, Im Neuenheimer Feld 280, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany. thomas.efferth@web.de']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20050121,England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', 'EC 3.1.- (ERCC1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.- (Endonucleases)', 'IGL471WQ8P (Cantharidin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cantharidin/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Repair', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/physiology', 'Endonucleases/physiology', 'Humans', 'Oxidative Stress']",2005/02/16 09:00,2005/03/25 09:00,['2005/02/16 09:00'],"['2004/08/30 00:00 [received]', '2004/12/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/02/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/25 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-2952(04)00819-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bcp.2004.12.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2005 Mar 1;69(5):811-8. doi: 10.1016/j.bcp.2004.12.003.

We found that Shp2 mutants associated with sporadic leukemias transform murine bone marrow cells, whereas NS mutants are less potent in this assay. Transformation requires multiple domains within Shp2 and the Shp2 binding protein Gab2, and is associated with hyperactivation of the Erk, Akt, and Stat5 pathways.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the prognostic importance of FOXP1 protein expression in an independent series of DLBCL.First, the specificity of our FOXP1 monoclonal antibody was verified by confirming that it did not recognize the closely related FOXP2, FOXP3, or FOXP4 proteins. FOXP1 protein expression was then analyzed by immunohistochemistry using a DLBCL tissue microarray constructed from 101 previously untreated de novo cases from the British Columbia Cancer Agency. FOXP1 expression was scored as either positive (>30% positive nuclei) or negative (<30% positive nuclei). The overall survival curves clearly showed that patients grouped as FOXP1-positive (40%) had a significantly decreased overall survival (P = 0.0001). FOXP1-positive patients had a median overall survival of 1.6 years compared with 12.2 years in FOXP1-negative cases. In addition, FOXP1-positive patients showed a clear trend to earlier progression in comparison to the FOXP1-negative patients. The analysis of FOXP1 expression within low, medium, and high International Prognostic Index groupings found that FOXP1-negative patients had better overall survival within each group indicating that FOXP1 expression has predictive value independent of the International Prognostic Index subgrouping, a finding that was confirmed in multivariate analysis.

However, plasma cell leukemia and extramedullary plasmacytoma usually down-regulate CD56 expression. Plasmacytoma, especially 'solitary plasmacytoma of bone', is difficult to diagnose as plasma cell neoplasm, because it occasionally appears similar to other bone tumors, both clinically and pathologically, and is rarely accompanied by monoclonal protein in the serum or urine. The present case was a patient with an osteolytic 'small round cell tumor' of the iliac bone, which also invaded the femora. An immunohistopathological finding of CD56 expression played a key role in making a diagnosis. The definitive diagnosis of plasmacytoma was made based on the electron microscopic findings. The plasma cells which infiltrated her sternum showed the same restriction to kappa light chain expression in their cytoplasms as that of the iliac bone tumor cells, but did not express CD56. Locally infiltrating osteolytic bone tumors should be examined for surface immunoglobulin light chains as well as CD56 expression when plasmacytoma is suspected.","['Kouno, Tsutomu', 'Watanabe, Takashi', 'Umeda, Toru', 'Beppu, Yasuo', 'Kojima, Rie', 'Sungwon, Kim', 'Kobayashi, Yukio', 'Tobinai, Kensei', 'Hasegawa, Tadashi', 'Matsuno, Yoshihiro']","['Kouno T', 'Watanabe T', 'Umeda T', 'Beppu Y', 'Kojima R', 'Sungwon K', 'Kobayashi Y', 'Tobinai K', 'Hasegawa T', 'Matsuno Y']","['Hematology Division, National Cancer Center Hospital 5-1-1 Tsukiji, Chuo-ku, Tokyo 104-0045, Japan. tkouno@ncc.go.jp']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Jpn J Clin Oncol,Japanese journal of clinical oncology,0313225,['0 (CD56 Antigen)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Bone Neoplasms/*diagnosis/immunology/pathology', 'CD56 Antigen/*biosynthesis', 'Female', 'Femur', 'Humans', 'Ilium', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Plasmacytoma/*diagnosis/immunology/pathology']",2005/02/15 09:00,2005/03/30 09:00,['2005/02/15 09:00'],"['2005/02/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/30 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['35/2/90 [pii]', '10.1093/jjco/hyi026 [doi]']",ppublish,Jpn J Clin Oncol. 2005 Feb;35(2):90-3. doi: 10.1093/jjco/hyi026.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An advantage of this approach is that it is largely unbiased by prior assumptions on the importance of each protein in the process under investigation. Here we have evaluated the protein changes that accompany the enlargement, or hypertrophy, of cardiomyocytes in culture. We have taken the additional step of comparing the changes that accompany a concentric hypertrophic phenotype stimulated by endothelin-1 exposure and an eccentric hypertrophic phenotype stimulated by leukemic inhibitory factor exposure. Following separation of the protein extracts by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and staining with colloidal Coomassie Brilliant Blue, we identified 15 protein spots representing 12 proteins that changed in response to endothelin-1. In comparison, 17 protein spots representing 17 proteins changed in response to leukemic inhibitory factor, and 35 protein spots representing 28 proteins did not change under these conditions. Importantly the well established marker of cardiac pathology, atrial natriuretic factor, was identified as a protein up-regulated by both endothelin-1 and leukemic inhibitory factor (2.4+/-0.8- and 2.2+/-0.3-fold, respectively). However, nine of the observed protein changes occurred for only endothelin-1, whereas 11 of the changes occurred only with leukemic inhibitory factor exposure. These two different stimuli are therefore able to elicit unique changes in the protein expression profile of cardiac myocytes. This is consistent with the differences in morphologies noted as well as the different signaling pathways utilized by these different stimuli.","['Casey, Tammy M', 'Arthur, Peter G', 'Bogoyevitch, Marie A']","['Casey TM', 'Arthur PG', 'Bogoyevitch MA']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, School of Biomedical and Chemical Sciences, University of Western Australia, Crawley, Western Australia 6009, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20050211,United States,Mol Cell Proteomics,Molecular & cellular proteomics : MCP,101125647,"['0 (Endothelin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cardiomegaly/*metabolism', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional', 'Endothelin-1/*pharmacology', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Interleukin-6/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Myocytes, Cardiac/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', '*Signal Transduction']",2005/02/15 09:00,2005/08/10 09:00,['2005/02/15 09:00'],"['2005/02/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/10 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1535-9476(20)31490-0 [pii]', '10.1074/mcp.M400155-MCP200 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Proteomics. 2005 May;4(5):651-61. doi: 10.1074/mcp.M400155-MCP200.

Emerging evidence suggests that the pathogenicity of HTLV-I involves deregulated activation of immune cells, especially T lymphocytes, although the underlying mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that HTLV-I Tax induces the aberrant expression of CD40, a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) family that plays an important role in lymphocyte activation and differentiation. In a panel of HTLV-I-transformed T cell lines analyzed, CD40 expression was highly elevated compared to HTLV-I-negative T cells. Using Tax mutants and a genetically manipulated T cell system, we demonstrated that Tax-induced CD40 expression required the NF-kappaB signaling pathway. In addition, ligation of CD40 on T cells with recombinant CD40L elicited NF-kappaB activation, suggesting that the CD40 pathway is intact and may participate in a positive regulatory loop in T cells. CD40 ligation strongly synergized with Tax to activate NF-kappaB, suggesting that CD40 signals may costimulate Tax-mediated NF-kappaB activation, particularly when Tax is expressed at low levels. Collectively, these results indicate that CD40 is a novel Tax-regulated gene, and the regulation of CD40 by Tax may play a role in cellular activation and HTLV-I-induced disease pathogenesis.","['Harhaj, Edward W', 'Harhaj, Nicole S', 'Grant, Christian', 'Mostoller, Kate', 'Alefantis, Timothy', 'Sun, Shao-Cong', 'Wigdahl, Brian']","['Harhaj EW', 'Harhaj NS', 'Grant C', 'Mostoller K', 'Alefantis T', 'Sun SC', 'Wigdahl B']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, The University of Miami School of Medicine, Miami, FL 33136, USA. eharhaj@med.miami.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,"['0 (CD40 Antigens)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (NF-kappa B)']",IM,"['CD40 Antigens/*biosynthesis', 'Cell Line', 'Gene Products, tax/*physiology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*physiology', 'Humans', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism/*physiology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Binding', 'Signal Transduction', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Up-Regulation/physiology']",2005/02/15 09:00,2005/04/05 09:00,['2005/02/15 09:00'],"['2004/09/10 00:00 [received]', '2004/10/16 00:00 [revised]', '2004/12/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/02/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/05 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0042-6822(04)00841-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.virol.2004.12.008 [doi]']",ppublish,Virology. 2005 Mar 1;333(1):145-58. doi: 10.1016/j.virol.2004.12.008.,,,,"['CA54559/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA68471/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA99926/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, natural resistance to bacterial infection, which does not depend on antibiotics, is a powerful protective mechanism common to all mankind. The availability of iron is the heart of the matter and the successful functioning of these antibacterial systems depends entirely upon an extremely low level of free ionic iron (10(-18) M) in normal tissue fluids. This in turn depends on well-oxygenated tissues where the oxidation-reduction potential (Eh) and pH control the binding of iron by unsaturated transferrin and lactoferrin. Bacterial virulence is greatly enhanced by freely available iron, such as that in fully-saturated transferrin or free haemoglobin. Following trauma a fall in tissue Eh and pH due to ischaemia, plus the reducing powers of bacteria, can make iron in transferrin freely available and abolish the bactericidal properties of tissue fluids with disastrous results for the host. Hyperbaric oxygen is a possible therapeutic measure that could restore normal bactericidal systems in infected tissues by raising the Eh and pH.","['Bullen, John J', 'Rogers, Henry J', 'Spalding, Paul B', 'Ward, Charles G']","['Bullen JJ', 'Rogers HJ', 'Spalding PB', 'Ward CG']","['The National Institute for Medical Research, Mill Hill, London. john.bullen@tiscali.fr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,England,FEMS Immunol Med Microbiol,FEMS immunology and medical microbiology,9315554,"['0 (Blood Substitutes)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bacteria/pathogenicity', 'Bacterial Infections/immunology/*metabolism/therapy', 'Blood Substitutes', 'Blood Transfusion', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Hyperbaric Oxygenation', 'Hypoxia/immunology/metabolism', 'Immunity, Innate', 'Iron/*metabolism', 'Iron Overload', 'Leukemia/immunology/metabolism', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Virulence', 'Wounds and Injuries/immunology/metabolism']",2005/02/15 09:00,2005/04/19 09:00,['2005/02/15 09:00'],"['2004/09/28 00:00 [received]', '2004/11/23 00:00 [revised]', '2004/11/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/02/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/19 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0928-8244(04)00257-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.femsim.2004.11.010 [doi]']",ppublish,FEMS Immunol Med Microbiol. 2005 Mar 1;43(3):325-30. doi: 10.1016/j.femsim.2004.11.010.,34,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The results revealed a dramatic increase in Stat3 phosphorylation at the critical tyr705 site and Stat3 activity following calcium-phosphate transfection. This increase was noted even in the absence of DNA and was not due to the mere presence of calcium ions. In contrast, DNA introduction through electroporation or infection with a retroviral vector did not affect Stat3 activity, while cationic lipids such as lipofectamine or Fugene6 had a less pronounced effect than calcium-phosphate transfection.

They have been especially informative in studies with twins concordant for leukaemia and in retrospective scrutiny of archived neonatal blood spots. These data have indicated that, in paediatric leukaemia, the majority of chromosome translocations arise in utero during foetal haemopoiesis. Chromosomal translocations and preleukaemic clones arise at a substantially higher frequency ( approximately 100x) before birth than the cumulative incidence or risk of disease, reflecting the requirement for complementary and secondary genetic events that occur postnatally. A consequence of the latter is a very variable and occasionally protracted postnatal latency of disease (1-15 years). These natural histories provide an important framework for consideration of key aetiological events in paediatric leukaemia.","['Greaves, Mel']",['Greaves M'],"['Chester Beatty Laboratories, Institute of Cancer Research, Section of Haemato-Oncology, 237 Fulham Road, London SW3 6JB, United Kingdom. mel.greaves@icr.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20041119,Ireland,Early Hum Dev,Early human development,7708381,,IM,"['Child', 'Diseases in Twins', 'Female', 'Fetal Diseases/*genetics', 'Genes/genetics', 'Humans', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*embryology/*genetics', 'Pregnancy', 'Preleukemia/*blood', 'Translocation, Genetic/*genetics', 'Twins, Monozygotic']",2005/02/15 09:00,2005/06/29 09:00,['2005/02/15 09:00'],"['2005/02/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/29 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0378-3782(04)00162-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.earlhumdev.2004.10.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Early Hum Dev. 2005 Jan;81(1):123-9. doi: 10.1016/j.earlhumdev.2004.10.004.

We show here that a significant portion of endogenous SNURF localizes to nuclear bodies (NBs) that overlap with or are adjacent to domains containing endogenous promyelocytic leukemia (PML) protein and small ubiquitin-like modifier-1 (SUMO-1). In biochemical assays, SNURF efficiently binds SUMO-1 in a noncovalent fashion. SNURF is also covalently modified by SUMO-1 at nonconsensus attachment sites. Ectopic expression of SUMO-1 markedly enhances the interaction between PML3 (PML IV) and SNURF, but covalent attachment of SUMO-1 to neither protein is required. Moreover, overexpression of PML3, but not PML-L (PML III), abolishes the coactivation function of SNURF in transactivation assays, which parallels the ability of PML3 to recruit SNURF to nuclear bodies. In sum, we have identified SNURF as a novel component in PML bodies and suggest that SUMO-1-facilitated sequestration into these nuclear domains regulates the transcriptional activity of SNURF.","['Hakli, Marika', 'Karvonen, Ulla', 'Janne, Olli A', 'Palvimo, Jorma J']","['Hakli M', 'Karvonen U', 'Janne OA', 'Palvimo JJ']","['Biomedicum Helsinki, Institute of Biomedicine, University of Helsinki, P.O.

GIST are radio and chemo-resistant (less than 10 objective responses). Stromal tumors originate from the multiplication of the cells of Cajal, which intervene in intestinal motility and express the c-Kit gene, also called CD117, on their surface. CD117 is a protein with tyrosine kinase activity, and can be demonstrated through immunohistochemical staining techniques. Treatment with Imatinib mesylate (Glivec), a recently discovered selective inhibitor of tyrosine kinases already used in chronic myeloid leukemia (in which an overexpression of tyrosine kinase is observed) was associated with tumor regression of more than 50% in the initial series of patients with GIST treated in 2001. Since then, approximately 2,000 patients have been included in therapeutic trials, with an objective response rate between 60% and 70% 12 to 18 months after inclusion. The clinical benefit has been estimated at 80% to 90% in patients whose chance of survival until now has been less than 30% at one year (median survival 18 months).

Lymph node samples from 98 DLBCL patients were examined for Ig heavy and light chain gene rearrangements using Southern blot analysis. Clonal diversity was defined as oligoclonality detected on Southern blotting as previously described, and PCR analysis for IgH oligoclonality was performed on parts of DLBCL samples with clonal diversity for confirming the Southern blot analysis results. We found that clonal diversity could be detected in 36 (36.7%) of DLBCL patients, and PCR analysis showed concordant results. Regarding the clinical relevance, clonal diversity was significantly associated with relapse or refractory disease. Survival analysis showed that clonal diversity is an independent prognostic factor in DLBCL (p=0.05, Cox's proportional hazard method), and stratified analyses found the most significant subgroup is the high-intermediate risk category (p=0.01, log-rank test).

Some 29 patients with T-cell lymphoma, including 20 with adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma, exhibited a significant increase in serum HGF, as did 23 with B-cell lymphoma. The levels of serum HGF correlated with increased neutrophil counts (r=0.487, p<0.0001), and also paralleled a neutrophil increase in NHL patients who received granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) at the nadir of neutrophil count following chemotherapy. Additionally, in in vitro experiments, HGF secretion from polymorphonuclear neutrophils and its expression in bone marrow myeloid cells were stimulated by G-CSF.

We have previously shown that C/EBPalpha is abundantly expressed in mouse epidermal keratinocytes. In the current study, the expression of C/EBPalpha was evaluated in seven mouse skin squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) cell lines that contain oncogenic Ha-Ras. C/EBPalpha mRNA and protein levels were greatly diminished in all seven SCC cell lines compared with normal primary keratinocytes, whereas C/EBPbeta levels were not dramatically changed. Reexpression of C/EBPalpha in these SCC cell lines resulted in the inhibition in SCC cell proliferation. To determine whether the decrease in C/EBPalpha expression observed in the SCC cell lines also occurred in the carcinoma itself, immunohistochemical staining for C/EBPalpha in mouse skin SCCs was conducted. All 14 SCCs evaluated displayed negligible C/EBPalpha protein expression and normal C/EBPbeta levels compared with the epidermis and all 14 carcinomas contained mutant Ras. To determine whether oncogenic Ras is involved in the down-regulation of C/EBPalpha, BALB/MK2 keratinocytes were infected with a retrovirus containing Ras12V, and C/EBPalpha protein, mRNA and DNA binding levels were determined. Keratinocytes infected with the retrovirus containing oncogenic Ras12V displayed greatly diminished C/EBPalpha protein, mRNA and DNA binding levels. In addition, BALB/MK2 cells containing endogenous mutant Ras displayed diminished C/EBPalpha expression and the ectopic expression of a dominant-negative RasN17 partially restored C/EBPalpha levels in these cells.

We have used cDNA array technology to compare the expression profile induced by activated N-ras (N-rasG13R) in growth-suppressed myeloid cells with that induced in myeloid cells, which are transformed by N-rasG13R. The expression profile induced in growth suppressed cells was consistent with differentiation and included the up-regulation of the transcription factor IFN regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1), a known transcriptional activator of p21(CIP/WAF1) expression and a target of oncogenic mutations associated with myeloid leukemia.

We report on the high dependence of stress-induced p53 activation on mitochondrial activity. Down-regulation of mitochondrial transmembrane potential (MTMP) by inhibitors of electron transport (rotenone, thenoyltrifluoroacetone (TTFA)) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis (oligomycin) prevented stress-induced p53 protein accumulation and abrogated p53-dependent apoptosis in a wild-type p53 leukemia cell line MOLT-3, in primary leukemia cells and in normal T lymphocytes. Using genome-wide gene expression analysis, stress-induced up-regulation of the p53 transcriptional targets and their specific inhibition by oligomycin has been demonstrated. Oligomycin did not impair p53-independent apoptosis and caused only a slight reduction of intracellular ATP levels. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) localized to mitochondria decreased in the presence of oligomycin, and stress-induced p53 activation showed strong ROS sensitivity both in leukemic and normal cells. These observations identify mitochondrial activity, described by MTMP and ROS levels, as a critical intracellular determinant of the p53 stress sensitivity and suggest potential implications of this linkage in the mechanisms of chemoresistance of acute leukemia cells.","['Karawajew, Leonid', 'Rhein, Peter', 'Czerwony, Grit', 'Ludwig, Wolf-Dieter']","['Karawajew L', 'Rhein P', 'Czerwony G', 'Ludwig WD']","['Department of Hematology, Oncology, and Tumor Immunology, Robert-Rossle-Clinic, HELIOS Klinikum Berlin-Buch, Charite Medical School, Berlin, Germany. karawajew@rrk.charite-buch.de <karawajew@rrk.charite-buch.de>']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20050210,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Chelating Agents)', '0 (Oligomycins)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (Uncoupling Agents)', '03L9OT429T (Rotenone)', '326-91-0 (Thenoyltrifluoroacetone)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'S88TT14065 (Oxygen)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/chemistry/metabolism', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chelating Agents/pharmacology', 'Down-Regulation', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Electrons', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genome', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Membranes/metabolism', 'Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Membrane Potentials', 'Mitochondria/*metabolism', 'Mutation', 'Oligomycins/pharmacology', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Oxygen/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Reactive Oxygen Species', 'Rotenone/pharmacology', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Thenoyltrifluoroacetone/pharmacology', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*metabolism', 'Uncoupling Agents/pharmacology', 'Up-Regulation']",2005/02/12 09:00,2005/07/14 09:00,['2005/02/12 09:00'],"['2005/02/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/14 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/12 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)53412-5 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2004-09-3428 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2005 Jun 15;105(12):4767-75. doi: 10.1182/blood-2004-09-3428.

In Akt-transformed leukemic cells, tumor growth can be inhibited by the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin, and clinical trials of rapamycin analogs for the treatment of leukemia are under way. Surprisingly, nontransformed hematopoietic cells can grow and proliferate in the presence of rapamycin. Here, we show that Pim-2 is required to confer rapamycin resistance. Primary hematopoietic cells from Pim-2- and Pim-1/Pim-2-deficient animals failed to accumulate and underwent apoptosis in the presence of rapamycin. Although animals deficient in Akt-1 or Pim-1/Pim-2 are viable, few animals with a compound deletion survived development, and those that were born had severe anemia. Primary hematopoietic cells from Akt-1/Pim-1/Pim-2-deficient animals displayed marked impairments in cell growth and survival. Conversely, ectopic expression of either Pim-2 or Akt-1 induced increased cell size and apoptotic resistance. However, though the effects of ectopic Akt-1 were reversed by rapamycin or a nonphosphorylatable form of 4EBP-1, those of Pim-2 were not. Coexpression of the transgenes in mice led to additive increases in cell size and survival and predisposed animals to rapid tumor formation. Together, these data indicate that Pim-2 and Akt-1 are critical components of overlapping but independent pathways, either of which is sufficient to promote the growth and survival of nontransformed hematopoietic cells.","['Hammerman, Peter S', 'Fox, Casey J', 'Birnbaum, Morris J', 'Thompson, Craig B']","['Hammerman PS', 'Fox CJ', 'Birnbaum MJ', 'Thompson CB']","['Department of Cancer Biology and Abramson Family Cancer Research Institute, Rm 451 BRB II/III, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104-6160, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",20050210,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-pim-1)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (proto-oncogene proteins pim)', 'W36ZG6FT64 (Sirolimus)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells, Cultured', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Neoplasms/etiology', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/genetics/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-pim-1', 'Sirolimus/pharmacology', 'Transduction, Genetic']",2005/02/12 09:00,2005/07/13 09:00,['2005/02/12 09:00'],"['2005/02/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/12 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)53491-5 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2004-09-3706 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2005 Jun 1;105(11):4477-83. doi: 10.1182/blood-2004-09-3706.

BMS-354825, currently in clinical development for imatinib-resistant chronic myelogenous leukemia, is a dual SRC/ABL kinase inhibitor that binds ABL in both the active and inactive conformation. To examine the potential role of conformational binding properties in drug resistance, we mapped the mutations in BCR-ABL capable of conferring resistance to BMS-354825. Through saturation mutagenesis, we identified 10 such BCR-ABL mutations, 8 of which occurred at drug contact residues. Some mutants were unique to BMS-354825, whereas others also conferred imatinib resistance. Remarkably, the identity of the amino acid substitution at either of two contact residues differentially affects sensitivity to imatinib or BMS-354825. The combination of imatinib plus BMS-354825 greatly reduced the recovery of drug-resistant clones. Our findings provide further rationale for considering kinase conformation in the design of kinase inhibitors against cancer targets.","['Burgess, Michael R', 'Skaggs, Brian J', 'Shah, Neil P', 'Lee, Francis Y', 'Sawyers, Charles L']","['Burgess MR', 'Skaggs BJ', 'Shah NP', 'Lee FY', 'Sawyers CL']","['Molecular Biology Institute, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, and Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles, CA 90095, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",20050210,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Primers', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl', 'Humans', 'Models, Molecular', 'Protein Conformation', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry']",2005/02/12 09:00,2005/04/14 09:00,['2005/02/12 09:00'],"['2005/02/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/14 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/12 09:00 [entrez]']","['0409770102 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.0409770102 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2005 Mar 1;102(9):3395-400. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0409770102.

HCF also participates in a variety of cellular processes, although the mechanism of its action is not known. VP16 binds to HCF through a 4-amino acid motif (EHAY), which closely resembles the HCF binding domain of two cellular basic leucine-zipper proteins, Luman and Zhangfei. Luman is a powerful transcription factor that, in transient expression assays, activates promoters containing cAMP or unfolded protein response elements (UPRE). In contrast, Zhangfei neither binds consensus recognition elements for basic leucine-zipper proteins nor does it activate promoters containing them. Here we show that Zhangfei suppresses the ability of Luman to activate transcription. HCF appeared to be required for efficient suppression. A mutant of Zhangfei, which was unable to bind HCF, was impaired in its ability to suppress Luman. Zhangfei did not suppress ATF6, a transcription factor closely related to Luman but that does not bind HCF, unless the HCF binding motif of Luman was grafted onto it. Zhangfei inhibited the HCF-dependent activation of a UPRE-containing promoter by a Gal4-Luman fusion protein but was unable to inhibit the HCF-independent activation by Gal4-Luman of a promoter that contained Gal4 binding motifs. Binding of HCF by Zhangfei was required for the co-localization of Luman and Zhangfei to nuclear domains, suggesting that HCF might target the proteins to a common location.","['Misra, Vikram', 'Rapin, Noreen', 'Akhova, Oksana', 'Bainbridge, Matthew', 'Korchinski, Paul']","['Misra V', 'Rapin N', 'Akhova O', 'Bainbridge M', 'Korchinski P']","['Department of Microbiology, Western College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, Canada. vikram.misra@usask.ca <vikram.misra@usask.ca>']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20050209,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (CREB3 protein, human)', '0 (CREBZF protein, human)', '0 (Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Herpes Simplex Virus Protein Vmw65)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'GMW67QNF9C (Leucine)']",IM,"['Adenoviridae/genetics', 'Amino Acid Motifs', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cyclic AMP/metabolism', 'Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein', 'DNA, Complementary/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*physiology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Herpes Simplex Virus Protein Vmw65/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Leucine/chemistry', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Plasmids/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'RNA/metabolism', 'Response Elements', 'Transcription Factors/chemistry/*metabolism/*physiology', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",2005/02/12 09:00,2005/06/09 09:00,['2005/02/12 09:00'],"['2005/02/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/09 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/12 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(20)66055-0 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M500728200 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2005 Apr 15;280(15):15257-66. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M500728200.

Although recombination-activating gene (RAG) and nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) proteins are indispensable in the generation of immunoglobulins and T-cell receptors (TCRs), most CDR3 diversity is contributed by nontemplated addition of nucleotides catalyzed by the nuclear enzyme terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase (TdT) and most nucleotide deletion is performed by exonucleases at V(D)J joins. Increasing TdT expression continuing into adult life results in N region addition and diversification of the T and B cell repertoires. In several species including mice and humans, there are multiple isoforms of TdT resulting from alternative mRNA splicing. The short form (TdTS) produces N additions during TCR and B-cell receptor (BCR) gene rearrangements. Other long isoforms, TdTL1 and TdTL2, have 3' --> 5' exonuclease activity. The two forms of TdT therefore have distinct and opposite functions in lymphocyte development. The enzymatic activities of the splice variants of TdT play an essential role in the diversification of lymphocyte repertoires by modifying the composition and length of the gene segments involved in the production of antibodies and T-cell receptors.","['Thai, To-Ha', 'Kearney, John F']","['Thai TH', 'Kearney JF']","['Division of Developmental and Clinical Immunology, Department of Microbiology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL 35204, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",,United States,Adv Immunol,Advances in immunology,0370425,"['0 (Isoenzymes)', 'EC 2.7.7.31 (DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase)']",IM,"['Alternative Splicing', 'Animals', 'Cattle', 'DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte', 'Gene Rearrangement, T-Lymphocyte', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia/enzymology', 'Lymphocytes/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Rats']",2005/02/12 09:00,2006/02/01 09:00,['2005/02/12 09:00'],"['2005/02/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/02/01 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/12 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0065277604860036 [pii]', '10.1016/S0065-2776(04)86003-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Adv Immunol. 2005;86:113-36. doi: 10.1016/S0065-2776(04)86003-6.,100,,,"['T32 AI 07051/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI 14782/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 AI007051/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI 14594/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 13148/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI014782/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated the problem of allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (allo-BMT) in patients over 40 years old. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 21 consecutive patients (13 males and 8 females) over 40 years old who underwent allo-BMT at our center during the past 12 years. RESULTS: The patients had a median age of 46 years, and 5 patients were over 50 years old. There were 8 cases of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), 5 cases of acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), 6 cases of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and 2 cases of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). The 3-year overall survival rate was 43.0%. Overall survival was associated with recovery of platelets in less than 30 days and recovery of neutrophil counts in less than 15 days. We did not observe any severe graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) or regimen-related toxicities. Twelve patients died of transplantation-related diseases. CONCLUSION: A faster recovery of the neutrophil and platelet counts was significantly associated with overall survival.

Alternative splicing of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) gene results in several isoforms. We examined an association of the expression pattern of GR isoforms in leukemic blasts with their sensitivity to glucocorticoid in childhood ALL. PROCEDURES: The relative mRNA expression of GRalpha, GRbeta, GRgamma, and GR-P was determined in leukemic blasts of 23 childhood ALL at initial presentation and of 14 ALL cell lines by quantitative RT-PCR. Glucocorticoid-sensitivity of leukemic blasts was determined by counting apoptotic cells with flow cytometry after 6-hr incubation with prednisolone (PSL). RESULTS: The relative expression of GRalpha mRNA was significantly higher in blasts of B-precursor ALL than those of others (13.6 vs. 2.24, P = 0.015), while those of GRalpha, GRbeta, and GRgamma showed no difference. GRbeta/GRalpha ratios were significantly lower in B-precursor ALL than others (0.80 vs. 4.64, P = 0.035). The proportions of apoptotic cells after PSL exposure were inversely correlated with the GRbeta/GRalpha ratios in ALL cell lines (r = -0.612, P = 0.020). PSL administration induced apoptosis efficiently in leukemic blasts with low GRbeta/GRalpha ratios compared with those of high ratios (cell lines: 4.93% vs. 1.90%, P = 0.013, primary leukemia: 11.7% vs. 3.6%, P = 0.037). CONCLUSIONS: The amounts of GR isoform mRNA in leukemic blasts were closely correlated with sensitivity to glucocorticoid exposure. The mRNA expression pattern of GR isoforms at initial presentation may provide valuable information for prognosis in children with newly diagnosed ALL.","['Koga, Yuhki', 'Matsuzaki, Akinobu', 'Suminoe, Aiko', 'Hattori, Hiroyoshi', 'Kanemitsu, Satomi', 'Hara, Toshiro']","['Koga Y', 'Matsuzaki A', 'Suminoe A', 'Hattori H', 'Kanemitsu S', 'Hara T']","['Department of Pediatrics, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan. yuuki-k@pediatr.med.kyushu-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Receptors, Glucocorticoid)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal/*pharmacology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics/immunology', 'Female', 'Glucocorticoids/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/*genetics/immunology', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Isoforms', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'RNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Receptors, Glucocorticoid/*genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Statistics, Nonparametric', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2005/02/11 09:00,2005/09/02 09:00,['2005/02/11 09:00'],"['2005/02/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/02 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/11 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.20308 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2005 Aug;45(2):121-7. doi: 10.1002/pbc.20308.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, they are considered to have a higher risk to relapse. We sought to correlate initial central nervous system (CNS) disease at diagnosis with shortened survival in childhood T-ALL. PROCEDURE: A retrospective analysis of 48 children with T-ALL was performed. The group consisted of 32 boys and 16 girls whose median age was 8 years. Their CNS status was classified as CNS-1 (no blast cells in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF); n = 44), CNS-2 (<5 WBC/microl of CSF with blast cells; n = 0), or CNS-3 (> or =5 WBC/microl of CSF with blast cells or signs of CNS involvement; n = 4). For univariate prognostic analyses, we used the log-rank test to determine the influence of patient characteristics (age, sex, lymphomatous presentations, initial leukocyte count, CNS disease, and newer therapeutic strategies) on each point. RESULTS: Complete remission was induced in 87.5% of patients. Median survival was 37 months, and 5-year overall survival and disease-free survival rates were 49.5% +/- 8.1% and 47.1% +/- 8.2%, respectively. Patients without initial CNS involvement seemed to have a trend toward longer overall survival (P = 0.036). Disease-free survival was not influenced by age, leukocyte count, or other factors analyzed. CONCLUSIONS: Patients who present with initial CNS involvement have a prognosis worse than that of patients without CNS disease. The introduction of early and effective CNS-directed therapy might no longer portend a poor prognosis for CNS leukemia.","['Jaing, Tang-Her', 'Yang, Chao-Ping', 'Hung, Iou-Jih', 'Tsay, Pei-Kwei', 'Tseng, Chen-Kan', 'Chen, Shih-Hsiang']","['Jaing TH', 'Yang CP', 'Hung IJ', 'Tsay PK', 'Tseng CK', 'Chen SH']","[""Divisions of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Chang Gung Children's Hospital, Taoyuan, Taiwan.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Central Nervous System Neoplasms/*diagnosis/mortality', 'Child', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*diagnosis/mortality', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Statistics, Nonparametric', 'Survival Rate', 'Taiwan/epidemiology']",2005/02/11 09:00,2005/09/02 09:00,['2005/02/11 09:00'],"['2005/02/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/02 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/11 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.20316 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2005 Aug;45(2):135-8. doi: 10.1002/pbc.20316.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We identified LAF-4 as a gene that is transcriptionally deregulated in breast tumors and thus may have a pathological role in mammary tumorigenesis. In line with the previous finding that LAF-4 expression is tissue specific, we did not detect any LAF-4 mRNA in normal mammary epithelial cell lines. However, 2 of 5 breast cancer cell lines were found to express LAF-4 at both the RNA and protein levels. In 2 of 9 primary tumor-normal pairs, the expression of LAF-4 was clearly elevated in the tumor tissue. Using RNA in situ hybridization, we demonstrated that LAF-4 is expressed in mammary tumor cells but not in normal acini. In a group of 64 primary human breast tumors, we found that LAF-4 was overexpressed in approximately 20% of the cases. Although epigenetic changes may be involved in altered expression of some genes, differences in LAF-4 expression were not associated with DNA methylation of the predicted promoter region. Our results suggest that LAF-4 may be a proto-oncogene that is transcriptionally activated in some cases of breast cancer.","['To, Minh D', 'Faseruk, Stephanie A', 'Gokgoz, Nalan', 'Pinnaduwage, Dushanthi', 'Done, Susan J', 'Andrulis, Irene L']","['To MD', 'Faseruk SA', 'Gokgoz N', 'Pinnaduwage D', 'Done SJ', 'Andrulis IL']","['Fred A.

The median time to relapse was 26 months. The significant fusion positive population heterogeneity revealed at interphase by a commercial probe for ETV6/RUNX1 fusion has not been described before. Six diagnostic samples had a single abnormal population; others had up to five each, which differed in the numbers of RUNX1 signals, and in the retention or loss of the second ETV6 signal. In contrast, the number of fusion signals was more constant. At relapse, there were fewer populations; the largest or unique clone was sometimes a re-emergence of a minor, diagnostic one, with a retained copy of ETV6 and the most RUNX1 signals. Abnormal, fusion negative clones were identified in bone marrow samples at extra-medullary relapse. Variant three or four-way translocations, which involved chromosomes 12 and 21, were prominent among the complex rearrangements revealed by metaphase FISH. The frequency of their occurrence at diagnosis and reappearance at relapse, sometimes accompanied by minor clonal evolution, was another new observation. Other recurrent cytogenetic features included a second copy of the fusion signal in six cases, partial duplication of the long arm of the X chromosome in two cases, and trisomy 10 in three cases. In comparing our data with previously reported cases, a picture is beginning to emerge of certain diagnostic features, which may provide circumstantial evidence of an increased risk of relapse.","['Martineau, Mary', 'Jalali, G Reza', 'Barber, Kerry E', 'Broadfield, Zoe J', 'Cheung, Kan Luk', 'Lilleyman, John', 'Moorman, Anthony V', 'Richards, Sue', 'Robinson, Hazel M', 'Ross, Fiona', 'Harrison, Christine J']","['Martineau M', 'Jalali GR', 'Barber KE', 'Broadfield ZJ', 'Cheung KL', 'Lilleyman J', 'Moorman AV', 'Richards S', 'Robinson HM', 'Ross F', 'Harrison CJ']","['LRF Cytogenetics Group, Cancer Sciences Division, University of Southampton, United Kingdom. m.martineau@soton.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (ETS translocation variant 6 protein)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Artificial Gene Fusion', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Infant', 'Karyotyping', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets', 'Recurrence', 'Repressor Proteins/*genetics', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics']",2005/02/11 09:00,2005/05/25 09:00,['2005/02/11 09:00'],"['2005/02/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/05/25 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/11 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/gcc.20158 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2005 May;43(1):54-71. doi: 10.1002/gcc.20158.,,,,,,,,,"['Copyright 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,

Mm1 cells have a high ability of phagocytosis along with significantly high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, UCP2 protein and manganese superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD), in contrast to undifferentiated leukemia cells (M1). Mm1 cells expressed 10-fold more UCP2 protein compared with undifferentiated M1 cells, although the UCP2 mRNA levels in both cell types were similar. The higher expression of UCP2 in the Mm1 cells suggests a regulatory role of UCP2 in the ROS production. Furthermore, the transfection of UCP2-GFP-expression vector in Mm1 cells dissipated the mitochondrial membrane potential and reduced ROS production, which was shown by their direct visualization using MitoTracker Red CM-H2Xros. The macrophage gp91phox protein, a membrane catalytic component of the NADPH oxidase complex, was at a similar level in both of UCP2-GFP expressed and non-expressed Mm1 cells. These results suggest that the UCP2 protein of the undifferentiated cell is regulated at a quite low level and the higher UCP2 protein of the differentiated macrophages involves with the regulation of ROS production.","['Nishio, Koji', 'Qiao, Shanlou', 'Yamashita, Hitoshi']","['Nishio K', 'Qiao S', 'Yamashita H']","['Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, 65 Tsurumai-cho, 466-8550, Showa-ku, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan. knishio@med.nagoya-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,J Mol Histol,Journal of molecular histology,101193653,"['0 (Ion Channels)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Membrane Transport Proteins)', '0 (Mitochondrial Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Ucp2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Ucp2 protein, rat)', '0 (Uncoupling Protein 2)', 'EC 1.15.1.1 (Superoxide Dismutase)', 'EC 1.6.3.- (Cybb protein, mouse)', 'EC 1.6.3.- (NADPH Oxidase 2)', 'EC 1.6.3.- (NADPH Oxidases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Ion Channels', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/metabolism', 'Macrophages/enzymology/*metabolism', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/analysis/metabolism', 'Membrane Potentials', 'Membrane Transport Proteins/analysis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mitochondria/chemistry/metabolism', 'Mitochondrial Proteins/analysis/genetics/*metabolism', 'NADPH Oxidase 2', 'NADPH Oxidases/analysis/metabolism', 'Phagocytosis', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Superoxide Dismutase/analysis/metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Uncoupling Protein 2']",2005/02/11 09:00,2005/09/09 09:00,['2005/02/11 09:00'],"['2004/06/29 00:00 [received]', '2004/09/02 00:00 [revised]', '2005/02/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/09 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/11 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s10735-004-2915-x [doi]'],ppublish,J Mol Histol. 2005 Feb;36(1-2):35-44. doi: 10.1007/s10735-004-2915-x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Induction of exogenous I-2PP2A/SET at a ratio of 1:1 to the endogenous protein resulted in suppression of cell proliferation. In contrast, siRNA-mediated depletion of I-2PP2A/SET resulted in enhanced cell proliferation. Depletion of I-2PP2A/SET was accompanied with a decrease in the number of cells in G1 and an increase in cells in S phase. To examine the mode of action by which I-2PP2A/SET suppresses cell proliferation, we determined the effect of over-expressed I-2PP2A/SET on ERK activation. I-2PP2A/SET suppressed activation of ERK following EGF stimulation but did not affect activation levels of stress kinases, JNK and p38. By contrast, knocking down I-2PP2A/SET by siRNA resulted in enhancement of ERK and MEK activations, suggesting that I-2PP2A/SET negatively regulates MEK/ERK. These data suggest that I-2PP2A/SET negatively regulates cell growth by inhibiting the G1/S transition and inhibiting the MEK/ERK pathway stimulated by external stimuli. These data demonstrate that I-2PP2A/SET potentially functions as a tumor suppressor.","['Fukukawa, Chikako', 'Shima, Hiroshi', 'Tanuma, Nobuhiro', 'Okada, Tadashi', 'Kato, Natsue', 'Adachi, Yoshifumi', 'Kikuchi, Kunimi']","['Fukukawa C', 'Shima H', 'Tanuma N', 'Okada T', 'Kato N', 'Adachi Y', 'Kikuchi K']","['Division of Biochemical Oncology and Immunology, Institute for Genetic Medicine, Hokkaido University, Sapporo 060-0815, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,"['0 (Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Histone Chaperones)', '0 (SET protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (MAP Kinase Kinase Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Phosphoprotein Phosphatases)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Protein Phosphatase 2)']",IM,"['Cell Cycle', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone/*genetics/*pharmacology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'HeLa Cells', 'Histone Chaperones', 'Humans', 'MAP Kinase Kinase Kinases/*pharmacology', 'Phosphoprotein Phosphatases/*genetics/*pharmacology', 'Protein Phosphatase 2', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics/*pharmacology']",2005/02/11 09:00,2005/06/18 09:00,['2005/02/11 09:00'],"['2005/02/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/18 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/11 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2005 Mar;26(3):751-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Long-distance inverse polymerase chain reaction identified FOXP1 as the partner gene on chromosome 3. To determine the frequency of the t(3;14)(p14.1;q32), two fluorescence in situ hybridization assays were established to screen 91 MALT lymphomas, all of which were negative for the above-mentioned three translocations, and eight splenic and six nodal marginal zone lymphomas. Overall, nine MALT lymphomas (10%) harbored t(3;14)(p14.1;q32) comprising tumors of the thyroid (three of six), ocular adnexa (four of 20), and skin (two of 20), whereas those of the stomach (n = 20), salivary gland (n = 20), and lung (n = 5) were negative as well as the splenic and nodal marginal zone lymphomas. Most t(3;14)(p14.1;q32) + MALT lymphomas harbored additional genetic abnormalities, such as trisomy 3. Further studies revealed that the three known translocations and t(3;14)(p14.1;q32) are mutually exclusive. Real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction showed upregulation of FOXP1 in cases with t(3;14)(p14.1;q32) or trisomy 3.

We show that the PI3-kinase/Akt pathway is constitutively active in primary acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) cells and that blockade by the selective inhibitor LY294002 reduces survival of the total blast population (mean 52%). The ERK/MAPK module is also constitutively active and treatment with the MAPKK inhibitor U0126 reduces cell survival by 22%. In 10 of 18 samples, PI3-kinase contributes to MAPK activation as incubation with LY294002 leads to a marked reduction in its phosphorylation. PI3-kinase inhibition reduces survival of the CD34+38- AML progenitor subset by 44%, whereas MAPKK inhibition has little effect. Reporter assays in primary AML cells show that blocking PI3-kinase leads to a marked reduction of constitutive NF-kappaB activity and promotes p53-mediated transcription. This is associated with a synergistic interaction between LY294002 and Ara-C. An inducible activated form of Akt protects normal myeloid cells from Ara-C and etoposide-mediated apoptosis. These results show that blocking PI3-kinase has direct antileukaemic effects and potentiates the response to conventional cytotoxics via a number of targets including NF-kappaB, p53 and MAPK.

We found that epigallocatechin (EGCG) decreases VEGF receptor phosphorylation and induces apoptosis in CLL B cells. The mechanism(s) by which VEGF receptor activation increases Mcl-1 and XIAP and promotes survival remains unknown. To further define the signaling pathway mediating VEGF induction of antiapoptotic proteins in CLL B-cells, we investigated downstream effects of VEGF-VEGF receptor binding on the STAT signaling pathway. We find that CLL B cells abundantly express cytoplasmic serine phosphorylated (p)-STAT-1 and p-STAT-3, VEGF-R1/2 are physically associated with p-STAT-1 and p-STAT-3, and p-STAT-3 (but not p-STAT-1) is found in the CLL nucleus. VEGF receptor ligation selectively induces activation and perinuclear translocation of STAT 3 through receptor-mediated endocytosis. The inhibition of VEGF receptor activation with either tyrosine kinase inhibitors or VEGF neutralizing antibodies inhibit VEGF receptor phosphorylation, decrease p-STAT-3 (serine 727), Mcl-1, and induces cell death in CLL B cells. Thus, a VEGF-VEGF receptor pathway in CLL B cells can be linked to activation of STAT proteins that are able to enhance their apoptotic resistance.","['Lee, Y K', 'Shanafelt, T D', 'Bone, N D', 'Strege, A K', 'Jelinek, D F', 'Kay, N E']","['Lee YK', 'Shanafelt TD', 'Bone ND', 'Strege AK', 'Jelinek DF', 'Kay NE']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (STAT1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT1 protein, human)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (VEGFA protein, human)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '452VLY9402 (Serine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-1)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Autocrine Communication', 'B-Lymphocytes/cytology/metabolism', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*metabolism/pathology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', 'STAT1 Transcription Factor', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'Serine/metabolism', 'Trans-Activators/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/pharmacology', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-1/*metabolism', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2/*metabolism']",2005/02/11 09:00,2005/05/27 09:00,['2005/02/11 09:00'],"['2005/02/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/05/27 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/11 09:00 [entrez]']","['2403667 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2403667 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2005 Apr;19(4):513-23. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403667.,,,,['R01 CA95241/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,['Leukemia. 2010 Apr;24(4):908.

Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)alpha levels are elevated, particularly in early-stage MDS, and apoptosis in marrow cells is upregulated. Observations in other models have shown a role for insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3) in TNFalpha-mediated apoptosis. We observed increased levels of IGFBP-3 in the marrow plasma of patients with MDS (P = 0.005) and hypothesized that altered IGFBP-3 levels contribute to the dysregulation of hemopoiesis in MDS by affecting proliferation and apoptosis. Western analysis of marrow plasma from MDS patients revealed an increase in the ratio of intact vs fragmented IGFBP-3 in early-stage MDS (relative to controls) that decreased with MDS disease progression, suggesting increased proteolysis with more advanced disease. Thus, these results provide evidence for dysregulation of IGFBP-3 in patients with MDS. While the data are complex, they are consistent with a modulatory effect of IGFBP-3 on hemopoiesis in MDS.

All these patients are at similar risk of gastrointestinal infections, and the subsequent morbidity and mortality from these infections makes it important to recognize the net state of immunosuppression of each person infected. RECENT FINDINGS: This review evaluates emerging pathogens, new diagnostic tools and guidelines, and the latest therapies published in the last 12 months in HIV and solid organ transplantation. The echinocandins provide a new therapy for Candida esophagitis, whereas Mycobacterium avium complex therapy may be discontinued with immune reconstitution in patients with HIV. The emergence of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria and viruses is a new threat to managing these infections, especially in poorer countries. Also, several community viruses such as adenovirus were shown to cause significant morbidity to immunocompromised patients. Lastly, the interaction among immunosuppressive medications, diarrhea, and rejection makes an important argument for evaluating patients for infection before adjusting medications. SUMMARY: The immunocompromised host is rapidly increasing in the world, resulting in exposures to new pathogenic organisms that cause gastrointestinal infections. New diagnostic tests and better antimicrobial therapy are improving outcomes in patients with access to health care. Unfortunately, these challenges are increasing daily with the development of multidrug-resistant bacteria and viruses that do not respond to standard therapies. The most important factor in overcoming these infections is restoration of the immune system, either by using antiretroviral therapy or decreasing immunosuppression.","['Forrest, Graeme']",['Forrest G'],"['Division of Infectious Diseases, University of Maryland, Baltimore, Maryland 21201, USA. gforrest@medicine.umaryland.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Curr Opin Gastroenterol,Current opinion in gastroenterology,8506887,,,,2005/02/11 09:00,2005/02/11 09:01,['2005/02/11 09:00'],"['2005/02/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/02/11 09:01 [medline]', '2005/02/11 09:00 [entrez]']","['00001574-200401000-00005 [pii]', '10.1097/00001574-200401000-00005 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Opin Gastroenterol. 2004 Jan;20(1):16-21. doi: 10.1097/00001574-200401000-00005.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: In a case-control study of adult acute leukemia, we examined the accuracy of cancer reports in deceased first-degree relatives using death certificates and the National Death Index (NDI). We submitted information on 1058 deceased relatives to the NDI or civil vital statistics registries. Social security numbers were not available and identifying information was incomplete. RESULTS: A death certificate was located for 70% of records sent to state registries but for only 32% of records submitted to the NDI. Death certificates confirmed 95% of relatives reported to be cancer-free and 83% of those reported to have any form of cancer. Confirmation of cancer of specific sites ranged from 50% for breast cancer and 54% for leukemia to 86% for prostate cancer.

The increased GFP expression was observed by 16 hr and was dependent on de novo protein production. This effect was specific to ATRA and unrelated to cell differentiation because it was not induced by dimethyl sulfoxide. Furthermore, a similar increase in GFP expression was observed in MSCV-GFP-transfected K562 cells, which do not differentiate when exposed to ATRA. Significantly increased GFP expression was seen at doses as low as 0.5 nM ATRA and was abrogated by AGN193109, an antagonist of retinoid signaling. We therefore conclude that this increase in gene expression is mediated by retinoic acid receptors. The long terminal repeat (LTR) region of MSCV contains candidate retinoic acid response elements and response elements for the ATRA-inducible transcription factor C/EBPalpha. We suggest that the increase in GFP expression is driven by the action of ATRA-activated host cell transcription factors. These findings offer a method to increase the expression of retroviral transgenes either in vitro or in vivo by treatment with low doses of retinoic acid that are clinically achievable and well tolerated. This use of inducible host cell transcription factors offers an alternative to engineering novel LTR regulatory sequences in order to increase transgene expression.","['Mountford, Joanne C', 'Vanin, Elio F', 'Hayden, Rachel E', 'Bunce, Christopher M']","['Mountford JC', 'Vanin EF', 'Hayden RE', 'Bunce CM']","['Section of Experimental Haematology and Haemopoietic Stem Cells, Division of Cancer Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow Royal Infirmary, Glasgow G31 2ER, United Kingdom. jcm7n@clinmed.gla.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Hum Gene Ther,Human gene therapy,9008950,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (G protein, vesicular stomatitis virus)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Naphthalenes)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'ZC6062V1O9 (AGN 193109)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/genetics', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Naphthalenes/pharmacology', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Stem Cells/virology', 'Transcription Factors', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Transgenes/*physiology', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/genetics']",2005/02/11 09:00,2005/06/01 09:00,['2005/02/11 09:00'],"['2005/02/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/01 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/11 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/hum.2005.16.132 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Gene Ther. 2005 Jan;16(1):132-8. doi: 10.1089/hum.2005.16.132.,,,,"['P01 HL 53749/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30CA 21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we show that overexpression of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 protects cells only partially against cephalostatin 1-induced apoptosis. The mechanism of Bcl-2 inactivation by cephalostatin 1 is based on hyperphosphorylation of Bcl-2 on Thr69 and Ser87 because Jurkat cells overexpressing a Bcl-2 protein with mutations on both phosphorylation sites were completely protected against cephalostatin 1. In search of the kinase responsible for Bcl-2 phosphorylation, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) was found to be activated by cephalostatin 1. Reduction of Bcl-2 phosphorylation by the specific JNK inhibitor (anthra(1,3-cd)pyrazol-6(2H)-one) SP600125 suggested a crucial role for JNK in this process. JNK activation was not a consequence of DNA damage, a known stimulus of JNK, because cephalostatin 1 did not induce DNA lesions as shown by the comet assay. Arrest in M-phase is also demonstrated to be associated with JNK activation. However, cephalostatin 1 does not evoke an arrest in M-phase as shown by flow cytometry. Together, cephalostatin 1 is shown to induce JNK activation with subsequent Bcl-2 phosphorylation and inactivation. Reported triggers, such as the induction of an M-phase arrest or DNA damage are not involved in this process, suggesting a novel mechanism for cephalostatin 1-mediated Bcl-2 hyperphosphorylation.","['Muller, Irina M', 'Dirsch, Verena M', 'Rudy, Anita', 'Lopez-Anton, Nancy', 'Pettit, George R', 'Vollmar, Angelika M']","['Muller IM', 'Dirsch VM', 'Rudy A', 'Lopez-Anton N', 'Pettit GR', 'Vollmar AM']","['Department of Pharmacy, Center of Drug Research, University of Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20050209,United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,"['0 (Phenazines)', '0 (Spiro Compounds)', '0 (Steroids)', '112088-56-9 (cephalostatin I)']",IM,"['Cell Division/*drug effects/genetics', 'DNA Damage/*drug effects/genetics', 'Gene Silencing/*drug effects', 'Genes, bcl-2/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Phenazines/chemistry/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Spiro Compounds/chemistry/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Steroids/chemistry/isolation & purification/*pharmacology']",2005/02/11 09:00,2005/06/16 09:00,['2005/02/11 09:00'],"['2005/02/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/16 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/11 09:00 [entrez]']","['mol.104.004234 [pii]', '10.1124/mol.104.004234 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 2005 May;67(5):1684-9. doi: 10.1124/mol.104.004234.

Here, we examine the variation of the tax and rex genes of BLV. The tax and rex genes share 420 bases and have overlapping reading frames. The tax gene encodes a protein that functions as a transactivator of the BLV promoter, is required for viral replication, acts on cellular promoters, and is responsible for oncogenesis. The rex facilitates the export of viral mRNAs from the nucleus and regulates transcription. We have sequenced five new isolates of the tax/rex gene. We examined the five new and three previously published tax/rex DNA and predicted amino acid sequences of BLV isolates from cattle in representative regions worldwide. The highest variation among nucleic acid sequences for tax and rex was 7% and 5%, respectively; among predicted amino acid sequences for Tax and Rex, 9% and 11%, respectively. Significantly more nucleotide changes resulted in predicted amino acid changes in the rex gene than in the tax gene (P < or = 0.0006). This variability is higher than previously reported for any region of the viral genome.

With the possible exception of patients presenting with late isolated extramedullary relapse, induction of second complete remission (CR) is employed as a stepping stone to allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). The authors report their institutional experience in the management of children with recurrent ALL using the Dana Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI) ALL protocol in patients treated initially with that same protocol. Successful reinduction was followed by allogeneic HSCT when possible. Between April 1986 and May 2003, 34 patients with recurrent ALL, treated at initial diagnosis with DFCI-ALL protocol therapy, were given the same protocol as repeat induction chemotherapy. The median age was 4.6 years at diagnosis and 7.1 years at recurrence. Median duration of CR1 was 30.3 months. Second CR was obtained in 29 (85%) patients. Twenty went on to allogeneic HSCT; 10 of them currently remain in CR. Two additional patients treated with chemotherapy without HSCT are also in continuous CR2. Overall, 13 (38%) of the 34 patients are alive with a median follow-up of 105 months. There were no toxic deaths due to the reinduction therapy. One child died of cardiac failure after autologous HSCT. The treatment of children with recurrent ALL using the DFCI-ALL protocol induction regimen after initial use of the same protocol is associated with a high rate of second CR with no excess toxicity.

In addition, stromal cell contact can promote resistance to chemotherapeutic agents. However, the precise biochemical pathways within the leukemic cell that are activated by the bone marrow microenvironment which result promotion of cell proliferation and apoptotic protection are not fully characterized. We have recently reported that simultaneous inhibition of the MEK and PI3K pathways or the MEK and mTOR pathways promote rapid apoptosis of the stromal cell dependent B-lineage ALL cell line BLIN-2 in the presence of stromal cell support. These data indicated that stromal cell induced apoptotic protection is mediated by PI3K/mTOR and MEK in a mechanism(s) that suggests cross-talk or points of convergence. The EGF receptor (EGFR) has been reported to activate both MEK and PI3K. We report herein that use of the EGFR inhibitor, AG1478, inhibits BLIN-2 survival in the presence of stromal cells. FACS analysis revealed that EGFR is expressed on the surface of BLIN-2 cells. The addition of EGF to BLIN-2 cultures in the absence of stromal cells prolongs BLIN-2 survival. Similarly, introduction of a constitutively active form of EGFR, v-ErbB, into BLIN-2 prolongs the survival of BLIN-2 cells in the absence of stromal cell support. These data provide evidence that stimulation of the EGFR pathway is one mechanism by which the bone marrow microenvironment may contribute to the growth and survival of B-cell acute leukemia.","['Spengeman, Justin D', 'Green, Thomas D', 'McCubrey, James A', 'Bertrand, Fred E']","['Spengeman JD', 'Green TD', 'McCubrey JA', 'Bertrand FE']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, The Brody School of Medicine at East Carolina University, Greenville, North Carolina 27834, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",20050311,United States,Cell Cycle,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,"['0 (Annexin A5)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Quinazolines)', '0 (Tyrphostins)', '170449-18-0 (RTKI cpd)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ErbB Receptors)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (MAP Kinase Kinase Kinases)']",IM,"['Annexin A5/chemistry', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'B-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Bone Marrow', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Separation', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Coculture Techniques', 'ErbB Receptors/*metabolism/*physiology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'MAP Kinase Kinase Kinases/metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Quinazolines', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'Stromal Cells/*cytology', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tyrphostins/pharmacology']",2005/02/11 09:00,2006/05/06 09:00,['2005/02/11 09:00'],"['2005/02/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/06 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/11 09:00 [entrez]']","['1533 [pii]', '10.4161/cc.4.3.1533 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Cycle. 2005 Mar;4(3):483-7. doi: 10.4161/cc.4.3.1533.

In this report, we investigated the effect of TES gene expression in vivo to evaluate a possible role of TES gene in human cancer. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We have analyzed the expression of TES gene in a panel of 25 breast tumors and 17 cell lines of breast, colon, and uterine cancers. Furthermore, to evaluate the potential of TES gene therapy, we studied the effects of adenoviral TES transduction (Ad-TES) in cell lines with undetectable TES expression (T47D and MES-SA) as well as in MCF-7 cell line where TES expression is normal. RESULTS: Twenty-five percent of primary breast tumor samples as well as the breast cancer cell line T47D and the uterine sarcoma cell line MES-SA were negative or displayed low levels of TES. After TES restoration by Ad-TES transduction, T47D and MES-SA cell lines underwent apoptosis. Furthermore, TES expression significantly reduced the tumorigenic potential of both T47D and MES-SA in nude mice, whereas the untreated cells and Ad-GFP-infected cells showed tumor growth in vivo. The TES-positive cell line control (MCF-7) was not affected by TES expression and did not show a reduction of tumorigenicity in nude mice after infection with Ad-TES. CONCLUSIONS: Ad-TES expression inhibit the growth of breast and uterine cancer cells lacking of TES expression through caspase-dependent and caspase-independent apoptosis, respectively, suggesting that Ad-TES infection should be explored as a therapeutic strategy.","['Sarti, Manuela', 'Sevignani, Cinzia', 'Calin, George A', 'Aqeilan, Rami', 'Shimizu, Masayoshi', 'Pentimalli, Francesca', 'Picchio, Maria Cristina', 'Godwin, Andrew', 'Rosenberg, Anne', 'Drusco, Alessandra', 'Negrini, Massimo', 'Croce, Carlo M']","['Sarti M', 'Sevignani C', 'Calin GA', 'Aqeilan R', 'Shimizu M', 'Pentimalli F', 'Picchio MC', 'Godwin A', 'Rosenberg A', 'Drusco A', 'Negrini M', 'Croce CM']","['Kimmel Cancer Center, Jefferson Medical College of Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Cytoskeletal Proteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (LIM Domain Proteins)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (TES protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Adenoviridae/genetics', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Breast Neoplasms/genetics/metabolism/*therapy', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Colonic Neoplasms/genetics/metabolism/*therapy', 'Cytoskeletal Proteins', 'Female', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'LIM Domain Proteins', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'RNA-Binding Proteins', 'Sarcoma, Experimental/genetics/metabolism/therapy', '*Transduction, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*therapeutic use', 'Uterine Neoplasms/genetics/metabolism/*therapy', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2005/02/11 09:00,2005/05/13 09:00,['2005/02/11 09:00'],"['2005/02/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/05/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/11 09:00 [entrez]']",['11/2/806 [pii]'],ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2005 Jan 15;11(2 Pt 1):806-13.,,,,"['CA 56336/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 77738/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Juvenile erythroleukemic mice (n = 8) received no treatment, celecoxib (1600 mg/kg/d), vinblastine (0.5 microg/g twice weekly), vehicle controls, or celecoxib + vinblastine combination (n = 9) over a 6-month period from time of tumor induction. Overt toxicity was assessed daily and recorded weekly. RESULTS: Among randomly selected mice from celecoxib treatment groups, plasma concentrations ranged from 2 to 6 micromol/L. As a single agent, celecoxib was not associated with any apparent toxicity. Monotherapy with vinblastine, however, caused early mortality marked by severe diarrhea, lethargy, and weight loss. At the tested doses, neither vinblastine nor celecoxib enhanced survival as monotherapies. Coadministration of these two drugs alleviated the overt toxicity associated with vinblastine and resulted in a significant increase in survival (P < 0.05). Survivors sampled throughout the study showed a trend to decreased weight loss and hematocrit levels among all groups, but significance was evidenced earlier in the vinblastine monotherapy group overall (P < 0.05). Despite similar degree of splenomegaly, histologic analysis revealed preserved splenic mantle architecture from mice given combination therapy compared with those sampled from mice on all other monotherapies, exhibiting a more diffuse burden of blasts and destruction of germinal centers. CONCLUSION: We propose that addition of a selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor to a modified low-dose conventional chemotherapeutic regimen protects juvenile mice with Friend disease from succumbing to low-dose cytotoxicity, in part, by neutralizing acute inflammatory responses.","['Cervi, Dave', 'Klement, Giannoula', 'Stempak, Diana', 'Baruchel, Sylvain', 'Koki, Alane', 'Ben-David, Yaacov']","['Cervi D', 'Klement G', 'Stempak D', 'Baruchel S', 'Koki A', 'Ben-David Y']","[""Department of Medical Biophysics, Sunnybrook and Women's College Health Sciences Centre, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada M4N 3M5.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Cyclooxygenase 2 Inhibitors)', '0 (Cyclooxygenase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (Cyclooxygenase 2)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthases)', 'JCX84Q7J1L (Celecoxib)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*therapeutic use', 'Cardiovascular Diseases/chemically induced', 'Celecoxib', 'Cyclooxygenase 2', 'Cyclooxygenase 2 Inhibitors', 'Cyclooxygenase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Female', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthases/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Pyrazoles/*therapeutic use', 'Sulfonamides/*therapeutic use', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vinblastine/*therapeutic use']",2005/02/11 09:00,2005/05/13 09:00,['2005/02/11 09:00'],"['2005/02/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/05/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/11 09:00 [entrez]']",['11/2/712 [pii]'],ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2005 Jan 15;11(2 Pt 1):712-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Enumeration of CD34+CD7+ cells was done on bone marrow nucleated cells from normal donors and CML patients. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis was done on sorted CD34+CD7+and CD34+CD7- cells to examine the occupancy rate of each fraction by BCR-ABL+ cells with or without additional cytogenetic abnormalities. RESULTS: The proportion of CD34+CD7+cells was significantly affected by the treatment outcome and/or the disease status as follows: 20.5 +/- 10.4% in normal donors (n = 22), 18.1 +/- 10.2% in CP with major cytogenetic response (n = 14), 53.0 +/- 12.9% in CP at diagnosis (n = 18), 55.0 +/- 15.8% in CP with minor or no cytogenetic response (n = 28), and 70.2 +/- 18.1% in AP (n = 6). The proportion of CD34+CD7+cells decreased in parallel with cytogenetic improvement in individual patients. In six untreated CP patients, the ratio of BCR-ABL+ cells was comparable between each fraction. In three patients with major cytogenetic response, the ratio of BCR-ABL+ cells was remarkably lower in CD34+CD7- cells than in CD34+CD7+cells. In three AP patients with additional cytogenetic abnormalities, extra signals were detected at a much higher rate in CD34+CD7+ cells than in CD34+CD7- cells.

Median age at HCT was 36.5 years, and median length of follow-up was 7.6 years. Overall survival was 68.8% +/- 1.8% at 10 years, and the cohort was at a 13-fold increased risk for late death (standardized mortality ratio [SMR] = 13.0) when compared with the general population. Mortality rates approached those of the general population after 10 years among patients at standard risk for relapse at HCT (SMR = 1.1) and in patients undergoing transplantation for acute myeloid leukemia (AML; SMR = 0.9). Relapse of primary disease (56%) and subsequent malignancies (25%) were leading causes of late death. Relapse-related mortality was increased among patients with Hodgkin disease (HD; relative risk [RR] = 3.6), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL; RR = 2.1), and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL; RR = 6.5).

Transcription of the human gene GP6 is driven largely by GATA-binding protein 1 (GATA-1), specificity protein 1 (Sp1), and Friend leukemia integration 1 (Fli-1). In this report, we show that GPVI expression during megakaryocytic differentiation is dependent on cytosine-phosphate-guanosine (CpG) demethylation that can be initiated by thrombopoietin (TPO). Sodium bisulfite genomic sequencing established that a CpG-rich island within the GP6 promoter region is fully methylated at 10 CpG sites in GPVI-nonexpressive cell lines, such as UT-7/EPO and C8161, but completely unmethylated in GPVI-expressive cell lines, including UT-7/TPO and CHRF288-11. To further confirm the relationship between CpG demethylation and expression of GPVI in primary cells, we treated human cord blood cells with TPO. The GP6 promoter is highly methylated in cord blood mononuclear cells (progenitors) but not in CD41+-enriched cells obtained after TPO differentiation. Furthermore, when UT-7/EPO-Mpl cells, which stably express human C-myeloproliferative leukemia virus ligand (c-Mpl), were treated with TPO, demethylation of the GP6 promoter was induced. In every case, demethylation of the GP6 promoter correlated with an increase in mRNA level. Thus, megakaryocyte-specific expression of the GP6 gene is regulated, in part, by CpG demethylation, which can be directly initiated by TPO.","['Kanaji, Sachiko', 'Kanaji, Taisuke', 'Jacquelin, Beatrice', 'Chang, Mei', 'Nugent, Diane J', 'Komatsu, Norio', 'Moroi, Masaaki', 'Izuhara, Kenji', 'Kunicki, Thomas J']","['Kanaji S', 'Kanaji T', 'Jacquelin B', 'Chang M', 'Nugent DJ', 'Komatsu N', 'Moroi M', 'Izuhara K', 'Kunicki TJ']","['Roon Research Center for Arteriosclerosis and Thrombosis, Division of Experimental Hemostasis and Thrombosis, Department of Molecular and Experimental Medicine, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",20050208,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (platelet membrane glycoprotein VI)', '9014-42-0 (Thrombopoietin)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Methylation/*drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Megakaryocytes/cytology/*drug effects/*metabolism', 'Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins/*genetics', 'Thrombopoietin/*pharmacology', 'Transcription, Genetic/*drug effects']",2005/02/11 09:00,2005/06/09 09:00,['2005/02/11 09:00'],"['2005/02/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/09 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/11 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)45475-8 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2004-08-3109 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2005 May 15;105(10):3888-92. doi: 10.1182/blood-2004-08-3109.

Here we have used Friend murine leukemia virus (F-MuLV)-induced erythroleukemia to investigate factors of the splenic microenvironment that may make it fertile for the expansion and survival of malignant erythroblasts. We found that splenectomized, erythroleukemic mice exhibited extended survival compared with age-matched sham controls. In vitro, the proliferation of primary erythroleukemic cells cocultured with leukemic-derived splenic adherent cells or their conditioned media was found to be significantly higher than that observed in cocultures with healthy-derived adherent splenic cells. Cytokine protein arrays revealed that F-MuLV-infected splenocytes secreted elevated levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A), macrophage chemoattractant protein-5 (MCP-5), soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor-1 (sTNFR1), IL-12p70, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and IL-2 over normal splenocytes. Medium supplemented with both VEGF-A and MCP-5 could sustain proliferation of primary erythroleukemic cells in vitro, and significant proliferative suppression was observed upon addition of neutralizing antibodies to either of these factors. Furthermore, in vivo administration of a neutralizing antibody to VEGF-A extended survival times of erythroleukemic mice in comparison with controls. These findings suggest that VEGF-A and MCP-5 are potentially pivotal paracrine mediators occurring within the diseased splenic microenvironment capable of promoting disease acceleration and expansion of erythroleukemic blasts.","['Shaked, Yuval', 'Cervi, Dave', 'Neuman, Manuela', 'Chen, Limor', 'Klement, Giannoula', 'Michaud, Crystal R', 'Haeri, Mehran', 'Pak, Brian J', 'Kerbel, Robert S', 'Ben-David, Yaacov']","['Shaked Y', 'Cervi D', 'Neuman M', 'Chen L', 'Klement G', 'Michaud CR', 'Haeri M', 'Pak BJ', 'Kerbel RS', 'Ben-David Y']","[""Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Sunnybrook and Women's College Health Sciences Centre, Toronto, ON, Canada.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",20050208,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Angiogenic Proteins)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Inflammation Mediators)', '0 (Monocyte Chemoattractant Proteins)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)']",IM,"['Angiogenic Proteins/*physiology', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/administration & dosage/pharmacology', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Cytokines/metabolism/physiology', 'Inflammation Mediators/*physiology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/etiology/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Monocyte Chemoattractant Proteins/immunology/metabolism', 'Paracrine Communication', 'Spleen/*metabolism/pathology', 'Splenectomy', 'Survival Rate', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/immunology/metabolism']",2005/02/11 09:00,2005/07/13 09:00,['2005/02/11 09:00'],"['2005/02/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/11 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)53494-0 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2004-08-3210 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2005 Jun 1;105(11):4500-7. doi: 10.1182/blood-2004-08-3210.

To characterize the mechanism of action of 4-HNE, we assessed genotoxic damage by 4-HNE and by 4-HNE triacetate [4-HNE(Ac)(3)] using the mouse lymphoma assay that measures the mutant frequency in the Tk gene. As a strong electrophile, 4-HNE reacts readily with nucleophilic centers on cellular components. When added extracellularly, it may react preferentially with proteins in culture medium or on the cell surface and not reach deeper cellular targets such as nuclear DNA. Therefore, 4-HNE(Ac)(3), a protected form of 4-HNE that is metabolically converted to 4-HNE in cells (Neely MD, Amarnath V, Weitlauf C, and Montine TJ, Chem Res Toxicol 15:40-47, 2002), was assayed in addition to 4-HNE. When added in serum-containing medium, 4-HNE was not mutagenic in the mouse lymphoma assay up to 38 muM (cytotoxicity = 13%). In contrast, exposure to 4-HNE(Ac)(3), which mimics intracellular formation of 4-HNE, resulted in dose-dependent induction of mutations. At 17 muM 4-HNE(Ac)(3) (cytotoxicity = 33%), the mutant frequency was 719 x 10(-6) (>7-fold higher than the spontaneous mutant frequency). Loss of heterozygosity analysis in the Tk mutants revealed that the majority of mutations induced by 4-HNE(Ac)(3) resulted from clastogenic events affecting a large segment of the chromosome. The results indicate that, in the presence of serum that approximates physiological conditions, 4-HNE generated intracellularly but not extracellularly is a strong mutagen via a clastogenic action at concentrations that may occur during oxidative stress.","['Singh, Sharda P', 'Chen, Tao', 'Chen, Ling', 'Mei, Nan', 'McLain, Eric', 'Samokyszyn, Victor', 'Thaden, John J', 'Moore, Martha M', 'Zimniak, Piotr']","['Singh SP', 'Chen T', 'Chen L', 'Mei N', 'McLain E', 'Samokyszyn V', 'Thaden JJ', 'Moore MM', 'Zimniak P']","['Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, 72205, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",20050208,United States,J Pharmacol Exp Ther,The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics,0376362,"['0 (Aldehydes)', '0 (Mutagens)', 'EC 2.7.1.21 (Thymidine Kinase)', 'K1CVM13F96 (4-hydroxy-2-nonenal)']",IM,"['Aldehydes/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Genetic Carrier Screening', 'Leukemia L5178/enzymology/*genetics', 'Lipid Peroxidation/*drug effects/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mutagens/*chemistry/pharmacology', 'Thymidine Kinase/*biosynthesis/genetics']",2005/02/11 09:00,2005/07/06 09:00,['2005/02/11 09:00'],"['2005/02/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/06 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/11 09:00 [entrez]']","['jpet.104.080754 [pii]', '10.1124/jpet.104.080754 [doi]']",ppublish,J Pharmacol Exp Ther. 2005 May;313(2):855-61. doi: 10.1124/jpet.104.080754.

The transcriptional activity of c-Jun can be regulated by both phosphorylation and sumoylation. It has also been shown that c-Jun transcription can be regulated by SuPr-1, an alternatively spliced form of SUMO-specific protease 2 (SENP2). However, the ability of SuPr-1 to enhance c-Jun transcription is dependent on promyelocytic leukemia but is independent of the desumoylation activity of SuPr-1. Here, we show that SUMO-specific protease 1 (SENP1) also markedly enhances the transcription activity of c-Jun. The action of SENP1 on c-Jun transcription is independent of the sumoylation and phosphorylation status of c-Jun but is critically dependent on the desumoylation activity of SENP1. We further show that p300 is essential for SENP1 to enhance c-Jun-dependent transcription because SENP1 can desumoylate the CRD1 domain of p300, thereby releasing the cis-repression of CRD1 on p300. Thus, two SUMO-specific proteases regulate c-Jun-dependent transcription through entirely different mechanisms.","['Cheng, Jinke', 'Perkins, Neil D', 'Yeh, Edward T H']","['Cheng J', 'Perkins ND', 'Yeh ET']","['Department of Cardiology, The University of Texas M.

Insight into the leukemia-associated Shwachman-Diamond Syndrome.,19221-9,"Shwachman-Diamond Syndrome (SDS) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by bone marrow failure with significant predisposition to the development of poor prognosis myelodysplasia and leukemia, exocrine pancreatic failure and metaphyseal chondrodysplasia. Although the SBDS gene mutated in this disorder is highly conserved in Archaea and all eukaryotes, the function is unknown. To interpret the molecular consequences of SDS-associated mutations, we have solved the crystal structure of the Archaeoglobus fulgidus SBDS protein orthologue at a resolution of 1.9 angstroms, revealing a three domain architecture. The N-terminal (FYSH) domain is the most frequent target for disease mutations and contains a novel mixed alpha/beta-fold identical to the single domain yeast protein Yhr087wp that is implicated in RNA metabolism. The central domain consists of a three-helical bundle, whereas the C-terminal domain has a ferredoxin-like fold. By genetic complementation analysis of the essential Saccharomyces cerevisiae SBDS orthologue YLR022C, we demonstrate an essential role in vivo for the FYSH domain and the central three-helical bundle. We further show that the common SDS-related K62X truncation is non-functional. Most SDS-related missense mutations that alter surface epitopes do not impair YLR022C function, but mutations affecting residues buried in the hydrophobic core of the FYSH domain severely impair or abrogate complementation. These data are consistent with absence of homozygosity for the common K62X truncation mutation in individuals with SDS, indicating that the SDS disease phenotype is a consequence of expression of hypomorphic SBDS alleles and that complete loss of SBDS function is likely to be lethal.","['Shammas, Camille', 'Menne, Tobias F', 'Hilcenko, Christine', 'Michell, Stephen R', 'Goyenechea, Beatriz', 'Boocock, Graeme R B', 'Durie, Peter R', 'Rommens, Johanna M', 'Warren, Alan J']","['Shammas C', 'Menne TF', 'Hilcenko C', 'Michell SR', 'Goyenechea B', 'Boocock GR', 'Durie PR', 'Rommens JM', 'Warren AJ']","['Medical Research Council Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge CB2 2QH, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20050208,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (SBDS protein, human)', '368GB5141J (Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', 'JU58VJ6Y3B (Guanidine)']",IM,"['Alleles', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Archaeoglobus fulgidus/metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Cycle', 'Crystallography, X-Ray', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Epitopes/chemistry', 'Escherichia coli/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Genetic Complementation Test', 'Guanidine/chemistry', 'Homozygote', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Phenotype', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Conformation', 'Protein Denaturation', 'Protein Folding', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Proteins/*chemistry/*genetics', 'RNA/chemistry', 'RNA, Messenger/chemistry', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae/metabolism', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate/chemistry', 'Syndrome', 'Time Factors']",2005/02/11 09:00,2005/07/13 09:00,['2005/02/11 09:00'],"['2005/02/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/11 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(20)67572-X [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M414656200 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2005 May 13;280(19):19221-9. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M414656200.

In the present study, concentration-dependent regulation of Cur on cell proliferation, viability and ROS generation, and effect of water-soluble antioxidants ascorbic acid (ASA), N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) and reduced glutathione (GSH) on the antioxidant and anticancer activity of Cur were investigated in human myeloid leukemia cells (HL-60 cells). We found that although Cur concentration- and time-dependently decreased the proliferation and viability of cells, its effect on ROS generation (as indicated by the level of malondialdehyde, MDA) varied with its concentrations. I.e., low concentrations of Cur diminished the ROS generation, while high Cur promoted it. Combined with the opposite effect of 50 microM H2O2 on low or high Cur-induced MDA alteration, cell proliferation arrest and cell death, these results proved that low Cur exerted its anticancer activity through diminishing ROS generation in HL-60 cells, while high Cur through promoting ROS generation. Further studies showed that all water-soluble antioxidants ASA, NAC and GSH significantly enhanced both the antioxidant and the anticancer activity of low Cur. Considering that the extra accumulation of ROS is harmful to normal cells, the data presented here indicate that instead of using high doses, combining low doses of Cur with water-soluble antioxidants is a better strategy for us to improve the anticancer activity of Cur.","['Chen, Jie', 'Wanming, Da', 'Zhang, Dawei', 'Liu, Qing', 'Kang, Jiuhong']","['Chen J', 'Wanming D', 'Zhang D', 'Liu Q', 'Kang J']","['School of Life Sciences, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Germany,Pharmazie,Die Pharmazie,9800766,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Indicators and Reagents)', '0 (Oxidants)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '4Y8F71G49Q (Malondialdehyde)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'IT942ZTH98 (Curcumin)', 'PQ6CK8PD0R (Ascorbic Acid)', 'WYQ7N0BPYC (Acetylcysteine)']",IM,"['Acetylcysteine/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Antioxidants/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Ascorbic Acid/pharmacology', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Curcumin/*pharmacology', 'Glutathione/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/pharmacology', 'Indicators and Reagents', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Lipid Peroxidation/drug effects', 'Malondialdehyde/metabolism', 'Oxidants/pharmacology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism']",2005/02/11 09:00,2005/03/05 09:00,['2005/02/11 09:00'],"['2005/02/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/05 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/11 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Pharmazie. 2005 Jan;60(1):57-61.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with and without the diagnosis of fungal infection were compared according to age, sex, diagnosis, stage of disease, type of therapy, antimicrobial prophylaxis, duration of febrile episodes, duration of antimicrobial therapy, duration of antifungal therapy, chest x-ray findings, results of surveillance cultures for fungal species isolation, clinical diagnosis at discharge from hospital, and autopsy findings. Clinical findings in patients with confirmed fungal infection on autopsy were analyzed separately. RESULTS: The incidence of fungal infection according to clinical diagnosis was 38.5%. The incidence among patients who died during therapy at autopsy was 78.5%. The incidence of Candida and Aspergillus infections at autopsy was 40% and 60%, respectively. Specific incidence could not be determined during life. The mortality was 59% in the group of patients with fungal infection, and 43% in the group of patients without fungal infection. During the study, an increase in the rate of fungal infection as well as a trend to prolonged survival of these patients were observed. On multivariate analysis, independent risk factors associated with a greater incidence of fungal infection were duration of hospitalization (p=0.04), duration of granulocytopenia with granulocyte count less than 0.5x10(9)/L (p=0.05), number of febrile episodes (p=0.01), duration of febrile episode (p=0.001), intestinal decontamination (p=0.02), duration of antibiotic therapy (p=0.01), positive chest x-ray finding (p=0.001), and year of therapy (p=0.02). On univariate analysis, a greater incidence of fungal infections was also associated with younger age, acute lymphatic leukemia, newly diagnosed disease and second relapse of the disease. The occurrence of fungal infections showed no correlation with the type of therapy, number of chemotherapy cycles, type of fungal species isolated from particular locations and frequency of colonization at particular locations. However, the number of colonized locations and number of fungal species was two to three times greater in patients with than in those without fungal infection. CONCLUSIONS: Fungal infections are becoming an increasing problem during intensive therapy of acute leukemia and contribute to poor therapy outcome. The diagnosis of fungal infection during life is extremely difficult and frequently late. There is the need of a more precise diagnostic test that would provide earlier diagnosis. The knowledge of risk factors is helpful in the diagnosis and therapy of fungal infections. The suspicion of fungal infection in patients at risk justifies the introduction of antifungal therapy and contributes to better therapeutic outcome.","['Zupanic-Krmek, Dubravka', 'Nemet, Damir', 'Mrsic, Mirando', 'Bogdanic, Vinko', 'Labar, Boris', 'Jandrlic, Marija', 'Kalenic, Smilja']","['Zupanic-Krmek D', 'Nemet D', 'Mrsic M', 'Bogdanic V', 'Labar B', 'Jandrlic M', 'Kalenic S']","['Odjel za hematologiju, Opca bolnica Sveti Duh, Zagreb, Hrvatska.']",['hrv'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,Croatia,Acta Med Croatica,Acta medica Croatica : casopis Hravatske akademije medicinskih znanosti,9208249,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mycoses/diagnosis/*etiology', 'Opportunistic Infections/diagnosis/*etiology', 'Risk Factors']",2005/02/11 09:00,2005/03/17 09:00,['2005/02/11 09:00'],"['2005/02/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/17 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/11 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Acta Med Croatica. 2004;58(4):275-84.,,,Cimbenici rizika invazivnih gljivicnih infekcija tijekom intenzivne terapije akutnih leukemija--retrospektivna studija.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Periods of prolonged neutropenia with neutrophil count less than 0.5 x 10(9)/L longer than 7 days, are the most important risk factors for the development of systemic fungal infections. Especially susceptible are the patients during treatment of acute leukemia, or after bone marrow transplantation. The most frequent causing agents of systemic fungal infections are Candida and Aspergillus species, than Cryptococcus neoformans and Mucor. Some other unusual species such Fusarium, Trichosporon, non-albicans Candida species of Candida are becoming more frequent, and is frequently resistant to conventional therapy. The difficulties in early and precise diagnosis of fungal infections, and the lack of adequate and efficient drugs are responsible for the high mortality of immunocompromised patients, even in potentially curable diseases. The recognition of risk factors, introduction of prophylactic measures, application of empirical antifungal therapy, are the procedures for the reduction of morbidity and mortality of invasive fungal infections. Fluconazole administration in prevention of systemic fungal infections, has become the standard approach, especially after bone marrow transplantation, while the oral itraconazole solution, has even more extended activity. Fluconazole appears successful also in the treatment of systemic Candidiasis. Conventional amphotericin-B is still the ""gold standard"" in the treatment of fungal infections. The new lipid formulations of amphotericin-B, intravenous itraconazole, has an identical efficacy, but are less toxic than conventional amphotericin-B.

We elucidated the pathways of apoptosis induced by the hybrid liposomes. That is, hybrid liposomes fused and accumulated in tumor cell membranes, and the apoptosis signal first passed through mitochondria, caspase-9 and caspase-3, second through Fas, caspase-8, caspase-3 and then reached the nucleus.

Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) in patients with a donor has been well established, but the role of autologous transplantation remains of interest, particularly in the light of some encouraging results in adults. PROCEDURE: Out of 81 pediatric patients with AML in first CR, 67 were biologically randomized for allogeneic (n = 31), autologous (n = 20), or peripheral stem cell transplant (n = 16) after completing consolidation treatment, with the remaining (n = 11) dropping out or receiving chemotherapy. Disease free survival (DFS) of these different groups were analyzed. RESULTS: Allogeneic transplantation is not superior to autologous and autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) (DFS in 5 years is 61%, 50%, and 75%). The 5 years DFS in the autologous PBSCT group is significantly better than in the autologous BMT group (75% vs. 50%, P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: In pediatric AML patients without a donor, autologous BMT or autologous PBSCT appears to be an effective treatment option with low transplant related mortality especially in less privileged countries where the chemotherapy only results are still low.","['Anak, Sema', 'Saribeyoglu, Ebru Tugrul', 'Bilgen, Hulya', 'Unuvar, Aysegul', 'Karakas, Zeynep', 'Devecioglu, Omer', 'Agaoglu, Leyla', 'Gedikoglu, Gunduz']","['Anak S', 'Saribeyoglu ET', 'Bilgen H', 'Unuvar A', 'Karakas Z', 'Devecioglu O', 'Agaoglu L', 'Gedikoglu G']","['Istanbul University, Istanbul School of Medicine, Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Istanbul, Turkey.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', '*Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2005/02/09 09:00,2005/06/10 09:00,['2005/02/09 09:00'],"['2005/02/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/10 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/09 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.20256 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2005 Jun 15;44(7):654-9. doi: 10.1002/pbc.20256.,,,,,,,,,"['Copyright 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,

PROCEDURE: We treated a 14-year-old female who had multiple osteolytic lesions and hypercalcemia at initial onset of ALL. In this case we examined some humoral factors, which are known to associate with hypercalcemia in malignancies. RESULTS: Parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHrP) was elevated in serum, and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry revealed that the lymphoblasts produced PTHrP directly. Other humoral factors related to hypercalcemia were not detected. ALL relapsed in the bone marrow 3 months after achieving complete remission, and hypercalcemia and elevation of serum PTHrP were also observed. A second remission could not be achieved and hypercalcemia continued. The patient received allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. The serum calcium level became normal after the conditioning therapy. Before engraftment, however, the patient died of infection. CONCLUSIONS: The present case suggests that blast-producing PTHrP might be associated with multiple osteolytic lesions and hypercalcemia. PTHrP expressed in the lymphoblasts may, in itself, confer a survival advantage to lymphoblasts and contribute to the refractory nature of the disease.","['Shimonodan, Hidemi', 'Nagayama, Jun', 'Nagatoshi, Yoshihisa', 'Hatanaka, Michiki', 'Takada, Akiko', 'Iguchi, Haruo', 'Oda, Yoshinao', 'Okamura, Jun']","['Shimonodan H', 'Nagayama J', 'Nagatoshi Y', 'Hatanaka M', 'Takada A', 'Iguchi H', 'Oda Y', 'Okamura J']","['Section of Pediatrics, National Kyushu Cancer Center, 3-1-1 Notame, Minami-ku, Fukuoka 811-1395, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,['0 (Parathyroid Hormone-Related Protein)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hypercalcemia/blood/*etiology', 'Osteolysis/blood/*etiology', 'Parathyroid Hormone-Related Protein/*blood', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/*complications', 'Recurrence']",2005/02/09 09:00,2005/09/21 09:00,['2005/02/09 09:00'],"['2005/02/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/21 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/09 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.20357 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2005 Sep;45(3):333-9. doi: 10.1002/pbc.20357.,37,,,,,,,,"['(c) 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,

The purpose of this study was to examine the incidence of and risk factors for transient hyperglycemia during induction chemotherapy in Hispanic pediatric patients diagnosed with B-Precursor ALL. PROCEDURE: The study cohort consisted of 155 Hispanic pediatric patients diagnosed with ALL and treated at one of two South Texas pediatric oncology centers between 1993 and 2002. Hyperglycemia was defined as > or = 2 glucose determinations of > or = 200 mg/dl during the first 28 days of induction chemotherapy. RESULTS: Overall, 11.0% of the study cohort developed transient hyperglycemia during induction chemotherapy. Age and body mass index (BMI) were both positively associated with the risk of hyperglycemia. Females exhibited a substantially higher risk of hyperglycemia than males, but this association did not reach statistical significance after adjusting for other covariates. Among patients who developed hyperglycemia, 100% of those who required insulin were in the 13-18-year age group and reported a family history of diabetes. Hyperglycemic patients classified as obese (BMI > or = 95 centile) were more than twice as likely to have required insulin therapy compared to overweight patients (BMI 85-<95 centile) and three times as likely to have required insulin compared to normal weight (BMI < 85 centile) patients. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of chemotherapy-induced transient hyperglycemia in the present study cohort is comparable to that reported in previous pediatric ALL patients. This finding is interesting in view of the elevated prevalence of obesity and the underlying dietary behaviors in this Hispanic study cohort.","['Baillargeon, Jacques', 'Langevin, Anne-Marie', 'Mullins, Judith', 'Ferry, Robert J Jr', 'DeAngulo, Guillermo', 'Thomas, Paul J', 'Estrada, Jaime', 'Pitney, Aaron', 'Pollock, Brad H']","['Baillargeon J', 'Langevin AM', 'Mullins J', 'Ferry RJ Jr', 'DeAngulo G', 'Thomas PJ', 'Estrada J', 'Pitney A', 'Pollock BH']","['Center for Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio, Texas 78229-3900, USA. baillargeon@uthscsa.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Factors', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects', 'Body Mass Index', '*Burkitt Lymphoma/complications/drug therapy', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Diabetes Mellitus/drug therapy/etiology', 'Female', 'Hispanic or Latino', 'Humans', 'Hyperglycemia/blood/*etiology', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Obesity/etiology', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/drug therapy', 'Risk Factors', 'Sex Factors']",2005/02/09 09:00,2006/01/13 09:00,['2005/02/09 09:00'],"['2005/02/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/09 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.20320 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2005 Dec;45(7):960-3. doi: 10.1002/pbc.20320.,,,,"['K08 DK002876/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'K08 DK002876-03/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'CA11078/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3102306,,,,"['2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,['NIHMS293487'],,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: K-562 (BCR/ABL+), U-937, and HL60 (BCR/ABL-) leukemic cell lines were incubated with STI571 and the antioxidant agents catalase, glutathione, superoxide dismutase, and amifostine (AMI). Apoptotic effect was analyzed by morphological and flow cytometric criteria. RESULTS: STI571 at concentrations higher than 0.25 mumol L(-1) produced apoptosis (P<0.05) in K-562 cells only after treatment for 72 h. At the mentioned concentrations, STI571 also induced an increase in the loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential from 24.6 to 40%. Combination of STI571 (0.5 micromol L(-1)) with antioxidant agents showed that the cytoprotective agent AMI (0.75 mg mL(-1)) produced an additive effect in the proapoptotic activity of STI571 in K-562 cells at nuclear (58.8%+/-2.0 vs. 28.9%+/-3.3) and mitochondrial (53.3%+/-3.6 vs. 29.5%+/-1.2) levels. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that only AMI in combination with STI571, at submicromolar concentration, has an additive effect in K-562 cell line, and it does not have severe toxic effects on Philadelphia chromosome negative cells.","['Vellon, Luciano', 'Gonzalez-Cid, Marcela', 'Nebel, Marcelo de Campos', 'Larripa, Irene']","['Vellon L', 'Gonzalez-Cid M', 'Nebel Mde C', 'Larripa I']","['Depto de Genetica, Instituto de Investigaciones Hematologicas Mariano R.

Some low-grade FLs are aggressively transformed into diffuse large B-cell lymphomas, presumably by acquisition of secondary chromosomal changes, including chromosomal band 1p36. A common example is add(1)(p36). Because it is difficult to identify the origin of add(1)(p36) even on high-resolution G-banding analysis, we used spectral karyotyping (SKY) and double-color fluorescence in situ hybridization (DC-FISH) to define the t(14;18) and the extra band at 1p36 in two cases of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). SKY revealed that the extra chromosomal segment on 1p36 was derived from chromosome 18. DC-FISH defined BCL2/IgH fusion signals at 1p36 in addition to t(14;18), suggesting that BCL2/IgH fusion at 1p36 was an evolutionary alteration following the primary BCL2/IgH translocation on der(18) in both cases. Our results indicate that IgH alleles, implicated in chromosomal rearrangement, may themselves frequently be targets for secondary translocations, suggesting that multiple IgH translocations and insertions are associated with the progression of FL.","['Nomura, Kenichi', 'Kanda-Akano, Yumiko', 'Shimizu, Daisuke', 'Okuda, Takashi', 'Yoshida, Naohisa', 'Matsumoto, Yosuke', 'Nishida, Kazuhiro', 'Taki, Tomohiko', 'Yokota, Shohei', 'Horiike, Shigeo', 'Taniwaki, Masafumi']","['Nomura K', 'Kanda-Akano Y', 'Shimizu D', 'Okuda T', 'Yoshida N', 'Matsumoto Y', 'Nishida K', 'Taki T', 'Yokota S', 'Horiike S', 'Taniwaki M']","['Molecular Hematology and Oncology, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine Graduate School of Medical Science, Kawaramachi-Hirokoji, Kyoto, 602-8566, Japan. nomuken@koto.kpu-m.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20050208,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)']",IM,"['Chromosome Banding/methods', 'Chromosome Painting/methods', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 18/*genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Karyotyping/methods', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics', '*Translocation, Genetic']",2005/02/09 09:00,2005/09/30 09:00,['2005/02/09 09:00'],"['2004/08/18 00:00 [received]', '2004/12/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/02/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/30 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/09 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00277-004-0995-z [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2005 Jul;84(7):474-6. doi: 10.1007/s00277-004-0995-z.

The T cell abnormalities found in CLL patients are thought to increase the risk of infection and hamper immune recognition and elimination of leukemic cells. We evaluated whether providing signals through CD3 and CD28 would correct some of these T cell defects. PBMC were incubated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 mAbs conjugated to superparamagnetic beads for 12-14 days. This resulted in a 1400-fold increase in T cell numbers. Activated T cells expressed high levels of CD25, CD54, CD137, and CD154, and produced IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, and GM-CSF. The mean T cell composition of cultures increased from approximately 6% to >90% and leukemic B cells decreased from a mean of approximately 85% to 0.1% or less. Leukemic B cells up-regulated expression of CD54, CD80, CD86, and CD95. Receptor up-regulation required direct cell contact with the activated T cells and could be blocked with anti-CD154 mAb, suggesting that the CD40-CD40L pathway helped mediate these effects. Poor T cell responses to allostimulation were corrected by the activation and expansion process. The skewing in the TCR repertoire returned to normal, or near normal following the culture process in eight of nine patients with abnormal TCR repertoires. Activated T cells had potent in vitro antileukemic effects in contrast to nonactivated T cells. Based upon these findings, a clinical trial has been initiated to test the potential therapeutic effects of T cells activated using this approach in patients with CLL.","['Bonyhadi, Mark', 'Frohlich, Mark', 'Rasmussen, Angela', 'Ferrand, Christophe', 'Grosmaire, Laura', 'Robinet, Eric', 'Leis, Jose', 'Maziarz, Richard T', 'Tiberghien, Pierre', 'Berenson, Ronald J']","['Bonyhadi M', 'Frohlich M', 'Rasmussen A', 'Ferrand C', 'Grosmaire L', 'Robinet E', 'Leis J', 'Maziarz RT', 'Tiberghien P', 'Berenson RJ']","['Xcyte Therapies, Inc., Seattle, WA 98104, USA. mbonyhadi@xcytetherapies.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (CD28 Antigens)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Isoantigens)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/metabolism', 'B-Lymphocyte Subsets/immunology/pathology', 'CD28 Antigens/*immunology/*metabolism', 'CD3 Complex/*immunology/*metabolism', 'Cell Communication/immunology', 'Cell Differentiation/immunology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Cytokines/biosynthesis', 'Gene Rearrangement, beta-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor', 'Humans', 'Immunomagnetic Separation/*methods', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Isoantigens/immunology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology/pathology/*therapy', 'Lymphocyte Activation/immunology', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Lymphocyte Culture Test, Mixed', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/biosynthesis', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/metabolism/pathology']",2005/02/09 09:00,2005/03/30 09:00,['2005/02/09 09:00'],"['2005/02/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/30 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/09 09:00 [entrez]']","['174/4/2366 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.174.4.2366 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2005 Feb 15;174(4):2366-75. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.174.4.2366.,,,,['1R43 CA83473-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,"['J Immunol. 2005 Jun 1;174(11):6562-3; author reply 6563.

We studied the role of indirect Ag presentation in allogenic T cell responses by adding populations of cytokine-expanded donor APC to hemopoietic grafts that would otherwise induce lethal GVHD. Progenipoietin-1 (a synthetic G-CSF/Flt-3 ligand molecule) and G-CSF expanded myeloid dendritic cells (DC), plasmacytoid DC, and a novel granulocyte-monocyte precursor population (GM) that differentiate into class II+,CD80/CD86+,CD40- APC during GVHD. Whereas addition of plasmacytoid and myeloid donor DC augmented GVHD, GM cells promoted transplant tolerance by MHC class II-restricted generation of IL-10-secreting, Ag-specific regulatory T cells. Importantly, although GM cells abrogated GVHD, graft-vs-leukemia effects were preserved. Thus, a population of cytokine-expanded GM precursors function as regulatory APCs, suggesting that G-CSF derivatives may have application in disorders characterized by a loss of self-tolerance.","['MacDonald, Kelli P A', 'Rowe, Vanessa', 'Clouston, Andrew D', 'Welply, Joseph K', 'Kuns, Rachel D', 'Ferrara, James L M', 'Thomas, Ranjeny', 'Hill, Geoffrey R']","['MacDonald KP', 'Rowe V', 'Clouston AD', 'Welply JK', 'Kuns RD', 'Ferrara JL', 'Thomas R', 'Hill GR']","['Queensland Institute of Medical Research, Herston, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (H-2 Antigens)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigen H-2D)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (progenipoietin-1)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigen-Presenting Cells/*immunology/metabolism/transplantation', 'Cell Differentiation/immunology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Centrifugation, Density Gradient', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/*administration & dosage', 'Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte/immunology', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/immunology/prevention & control', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/immunology', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*administration & dosage', 'Granulocytes/cytology/transplantation', 'H-2 Antigens/immunology', 'Histocompatibility Antigen H-2D', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-10/*biosynthesis/deficiency/genetics/physiology', 'Lymphocyte Depletion', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Monocytes/cytology/transplantation', 'Myeloid Progenitor Cells/*immunology/metabolism/transplantation', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Spleen/cytology/transplantation', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/*immunology/metabolism', '*Transplantation Tolerance']",2005/02/09 09:00,2005/03/30 09:00,['2005/02/09 09:00'],"['2005/02/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/30 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/09 09:00 [entrez]']","['174/4/1841 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.174.4.1841 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2005 Feb 15;174(4):1841-50. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.174.4.1841.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia represents 12% of all leukaemia cases, with a worldwide incidence projected to be 1-4.75 per 100,000 people. Italy, the United States (US), Switzerland, and Costa Rica are the countries with the highest incidence of ALL. Hereditary link, genetic defects, and possibly radiation or chemical exposures are listed amongst the most significant risk factors. Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia is predominantly a disease of childhood, but it affects adults as well. It accounts for 80% of all leukaemia cases in children. The incidence is slightly higher in men than in women and greater in white people than in black people. In 2003 in the US, there were an estimated 5800 deaths from ALL. Presenting signs and symptoms of ALL are fairly non-specific and include fever, anaemia, petechiae, and bone and joint pain. Staging of the disease and patient risk profile are routinely performed to define ALL subtypes and guide management. Chemotherapy, cranial radiation in patients with high-risk disease, and stem cell transplantation for selected patients are the prevalent therapies. Complete remission rates are high, especially amongst children (even 100%); however, long-term survival at 10 years (event-free survival) is in the range of 63% for children and 25-35% for adults. This implies that there is still a strong need for new therapies to maintain remission and prolong survival. Future treatment strategies may be driven by the patient's minimal residual disease status, a measure that more precisely defines remission, prognosis, responsiveness to therapy, and expected long-term survival.","['Redaelli, A', 'Laskin, B L', 'Stephens, J M', 'Botteman, M F', 'Pashos, C L']","['Redaelli A', 'Laskin BL', 'Stephens JM', 'Botteman MF', 'Pashos CL']","['Global Outcomes Research-Oncology, Pharmacia Corporation, Viale Pasteur 10(20014) Nerviano, Milan, Italy. alberto.redaelli@pharmacia.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",,England,Eur J Cancer Care (Engl),European journal of cancer care,9301979,,,"['Age Distribution', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/methods', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*epidemiology/therapy', 'Prevalence', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Assessment/methods']",2005/02/09 09:00,2005/06/09 09:00,['2005/02/09 09:00'],"['2005/02/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/09 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/09 09:00 [entrez]']","['ECC513 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2354.2005.00513.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Cancer Care (Engl). 2005 Mar;14(1):53-62. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2354.2005.00513.x.,26,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the Nd:YAG laser appears to be difficult to use, and argon laser energy may be more likely to be absorbed by the ocular media. We performed a study to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of krypton laser membranotomy in selected cases of premacular hemorrhage. METHODS: Sixteen patients (17 eyes) with dense premacular hemorrhage for 2 weeks or less were enrolled from April 1998 to February 2004. The causes of premacular hemorrhage were proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) in 12 eyes, Valsalva retinopathy in 3 eyes, leukemia in I eye and retinal arterial macroaneurysm in I eye. Krypton laser was used to create a membranotomy on the sloping edge of the premacular hemorrhage. Five eyes with PDR were treated with inferior panretinal photocoagulation and laser membranotomy simultaneously. After intravitreal dispersion of premacular blood, fundus examination was performed in all eyes and fluorescein angiography in five eyes to evaluate retinal damage. RESULTS: All eyes had visual improvement within 2 weeks postoperatively. No retinal damage was seen at the site of membranotomy in any eye. No eye needed vitrectomy postoperatively during a mean follow-up duration of 18.6 months. INTERPRETATION: Krypton laser membranotomy appears to be a safe and simple alternative procedure for treating selected cases of premacular hemorrhage. Further trials are necessary to evaluate its benefit.","['Chen, Yung-Jen', 'Kou, His-Kung']","['Chen YJ', 'Kou HK']","['Department of Ophthalmology, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Kaohsiung Hsien, Taiwan. d2767@adm.cgmh.org.tw']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Can J Ophthalmol,Canadian journal of ophthalmology.

Possible cancer risks in PTCA patients have been discussed, but never before examined in a population-based setting. OBJECTIVE: To assess the cancer risks following PTCA. METHODS: A cohort study was carried out based on nationwide registration of all coronary angioplasty procedures in Sweden between 1989 and 1998. The study encompassed a total of 23,097 PTCA patients followed up for cancer outcomes in the Swedish Cancer Register until December 31, 2000. The mean and median follow-up times were 4.8 and 4.5 years, respectively. The main outcome measures were standardized incidence ratios of cancer. RESULTS: Except for a transient excess of lung cancers, observed number of cancers in patients who had undergone coronary angioplasty did not differ from those expected in the general population. If anything, the overall cancer risk was lower in the PTCA group (SIR 0.94; 95% CI 0.88-0.99). In particular, no increased risks were detected for leukemias or thyroid cancer. CONCLUSION: There was no indication of increased risks of leukemia or cancers overall in PTCA patients.","['Lambe, M', 'Hall, P', 'Granath, F', 'Sadr Azodi, O', 'Nilsson, T']","['Lambe M', 'Hall P', 'Granath F', 'Sadr Azodi O', 'Nilsson T']","['Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Karolinska Institutet, P.O.

PCR protocols were developed which allow an unbiased amplification of the whole genome of a single cell for subsequent analyses by comparative genomic hybridization (CGH). However, verification of single-cell CGH results has been impossible as the procedure naturally involves the destruction of the respective cell. Here we show that the genome of individual cells can be analyzed by two different single cell techniques applied sequentially to the same cell. In a first step, interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is applied. After evaluation of the interphase-FISH signals, cells of interest can be selected for a further analysis. Single cells are collected by laser microdissection, the DNA is amplified by linker-adaptor PCR and subjected to CGH-analysis. This strategy offers new opportunities for a sophisticated selection of cells based on interphase-FISH signals. Furthermore, the sequential application of two different single-cell approaches to the same single-cell represents the only option to control and verify the single-cell CGH results. We demonstrate the feasibility of this approach with a series of experiments including cells from pre- and postnatal diagnostics, for example, cells with trisomies 13, 18, or 21, respectively, leukemia and tumor cells and tissue sections.","['Langer, Sabine', 'Geigl, Jochen B', 'Gangnus, Rainer', 'Speicher, Michael R']","['Langer S', 'Geigl JB', 'Gangnus R', 'Speicher MR']","['Institut fur Humangenetik, Technische Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Lab Invest,Laboratory investigation; a journal of technical methods and pathology,0376617,,IM,"['*In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', '*Interphase', '*Nucleic Acid Hybridization']",2005/02/08 09:00,2005/05/27 09:00,['2005/02/08 09:00'],"['2005/02/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/05/27 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['3700249 [pii]', '10.1038/labinvest.3700249 [doi]']",ppublish,Lab Invest. 2005 Apr;85(4):582-92. doi: 10.1038/labinvest.3700249.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Analyses were performed in 23 patients receiving pSCT immediately before or during the first 2 days of the conditioning regimen. In all, 40 or more Tc-1 cells/microl pretransplant were associated with a significantly increased risk of aGvHD (10/10 patients with GvHD>/=II; 4/13 patients without aGvHD with a Tc-1 number >40/microl, P<0.002, Fisher's exact test). In addition, 40 or more Th-1 cells/microl pretransplant were also associated with a significantly increased risk of aGvHD (P<0.04, Fisher's exact test). Furthermore, the number of Th-2 cells was significantly higher in patients with severe aGvHD even though the median absolute cell counts were very low. However, all other investigated parameters did not reveal predictive value.

The data obtained then were analyzed to assess the patients' level of fatigue, the types of fatigue-relieving strategies used, and the effectiveness of the strategies. RESULTS: The participants (n = 157) returned the survey at a response rate of 70.9%. Most of the participants perceived a moderate level of fatigue (mean, 4.7 +/- 1.7). More than 15% reported that they experienced a high level of fatigue. Most of the participants (95%) chose to take some rest and reduce physical activities.

Herein, the role of transcription factors, Sp1 and NFkappaB in differentiation-related and etoposide-induced apoptosis was examined in a number of human leukemia cell lines (HL-60, NB4, HEL, THP-1, K562). This was investigated with respect to the recruitment of one cell-cycle regulating gene, p21 and one cell death gene, FasL. Using electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), we consistently observed Sp1 and NFkappaB binding activity to the promoter of either gene during cell differentiation and the decrease associated with apoptosis upon long-term treatment with differentiation inducers in HL-60, NB4 and HEL cells. By contrast, Sp1 and NFkappaB binding capacities were lost in all myeloid cell lines undergoing etoposide-induced fast apoptosis. This effect was eliminated by the broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor, benzyloxycarbonyl-valinyl-alaninyl-aspartyl fluoromethylketone, thus restoring transcription factors' binding activity. However, sustained NFkappaB binding to the FasL promoter was noticed in apoptosis undergoing HEL cells treated by etoposide. Our results suggest that p21 and FasL gene activation is required for myeloid leukemia cell survival or maturation but not for cell death via Sp1 and NFkappaB as regulators of these genes. The findings also support the idea of a common mechanism for cellular responses to different apoptotic effectors in malignant hematopoietic cell lines.","['Savickiene, J', 'Treigyte, G', 'Magnusson, K-E', 'Navakauskiene, R']","['Savickiene J', 'Treigyte G', 'Magnusson KE', 'Navakauskiene R']","['Department of Developmental Biology, Institute of Biochemistry, LT-08662 Vilnius, Lithuania. savickiene@bchi.lt']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,Int J Biochem Cell Biol,The international journal of biochemistry & cell biology,9508482,"['0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (FASLG protein, human)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Sp1 Transcription Factor)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/*genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/*genetics/physiology', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'DNA Primers', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', 'Fas Ligand Protein', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*genetics', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism/*physiology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Sp1 Transcription Factor/metabolism/*physiology']",2005/02/08 09:00,2005/07/01 09:00,['2005/02/08 09:00'],"['2004/06/23 00:00 [received]', '2004/09/14 00:00 [revised]', '2004/10/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/02/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/01 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1357-2725(04)00375-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.biocel.2004.10.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Biochem Cell Biol. 2005 Apr;37(4):784-96. doi: 10.1016/j.biocel.2004.10.002.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Light can be considered as a candidate risk factor because it suppresses melatonin biosynthesis which may play a role in a series of anticancer defences. Indeed, melatonin may offer some protection against all ""hallmarks of cancer"" [i.e., self-sufficiency in growth signals; insensitivity to growth-inhibitory signals; evasion of programmed cell death (apoptosis); limitless replicative potential; sustained angiogenesis; tissue invasion and metastasis] recently suggested by Hanahan and Weinberg. Already ongoing investigations into the possible nexus of light, endocrine systems and the development of cancers will be further fueled by recent insights into photoreception and -- transduction, including the discovery of ""novel"" photoreceptors in the eye. Among a variety of different photosensory tasks, these receptors constitute crucial gates for light information from the environment which is employed for the temporal organization of our physiology and it has been proposed that chronodisruption, i.e., a significant disturbance of the coordination and thus order of biological rhythms, could contribute to the development of cancers. With regard to public health, the pervasive exposures to light -- at work and in homes -- imply that visible radiation could be a strong risk factor defined epidemiologically as a causal contributor to disease in a large proportion of cases. Importantly, if light were to be corroborated as a contributor to cancers in children, it would be amenable to manipulations with the perspective of reducing inherent risks significantly. In fact, it could be much easier -- and much more effective -- to reevaluate and modify lighting systems than to manipulate other possible determinants of the chronic processes of cancer such as genetic, nutritional or lifestyle factors.","['Erren, Thomas C']",['Erren TC'],"['Institute and Policlinic for Occupational and Social Medicine, School of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Cologne, Joseph-Stelzmann-Str. 9, 50924 Koln, Lindenthal, Germany. tim.erren@uni-koeln.de']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Med Hypotheses,Medical hypotheses,7505668,,IM,"['Child', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*etiology', 'Light/*adverse effects', 'Mutation']",2005/02/08 09:00,2005/09/28 09:00,['2005/02/08 09:00'],"['2004/09/20 00:00 [received]', '2004/09/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/02/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/28 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0306-9877(04)00560-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.mehy.2004.09.021 [doi]']",ppublish,Med Hypotheses. 2005;64(4):864-71. doi: 10.1016/j.mehy.2004.09.021.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

More importantly, low blood Se levels were found to be associated with an increased incidence and mortality from various types of cancers. Recently, attention of researchers was drawn to the relationship between free radical generation, known otherwise as oxidative stress, and carcinogenesis. It was therefore thought that antioxidants should be beneficial for prevention and inhibition of different malignancies. However, there appeared to be a paradox, because tumor growth is associated with tissue hypoxia that is accompanied by the formation of reductive rather than oxidative free radicals. Various organic and inorganic Se compounds, generally considered to be antioxidants, produced mixed results when tested in animal models and human subjects. Amongst them, sodium selenite has been shown to be the most effective in an in vitro and in vivo carcinogenesis studies. As recently demonstrated, selenite is not an antioxidant, but possesses oxidizing properties in the presence of specific substrates. Thus selenite is capable of oxidizing polythiols to corresponding disulfides, but does not react with monothiols. Such polythiols associated with cancer membrane-bound proteins appear under the reducing conditions of hypoxic tumor tissue. These thiol groups can, in turn, initiate a disulfide exchange reaction with plasma proteins, predominantly with fibrinogen, to form an insoluble and protease-resistant fibrin-like polymer. As the result, tumor cells become surrounded by a coat which masks specific tumor antigens thus allowing cancer cells to escape immune recognition and elimination by natural killer (NK) cells. Selenite by virtue of oxidizing cell membrane thiols, can prevent the formation of the coat and consequently makes cancer cells vulnerable to the immune surveillance and destruction. In addition, selenite may directly activate NK cells, as well as inhibit angiogenesis without undesirable decrease in the oxidative potential of cellular environment. It is, therefore, postulated that sodium selenite, in view of its relative low toxicity, might become a drug of choice for many types of cancer including leukemia.","['Lipinski, Boguslaw']",['Lipinski B'],"['H.S.

This study was to compare expressions of Cyclins A, B1, D3, and E in G(1) phase of asynchronized and synchronized cells by newly established ""postsorting Western blot"", and to conform the unreasonableness of using double thymidine blocks to synchronize cells to analyze normal cell cycles. METHODS: MOLT-4 cells were synchronized at G(1) phase by double thymidine blocks, asynchronous cells of G(1) phase were sorted by FCM. Western blot and double parameters analysis of DNA/Cyclins were performed to detect Cyclins A, B1, D3, and E expressions in asynchronous and synchronous MOLT-4 cells of G(1) phase. RESULTS: There were almost no expressions of Cyclins A, B1 in asynchronous MOLT-4 cells of G(1) phase, and obvious expressions in synchronized cells of G(1) phase.

METHODS: The cDNA encoding Apr-1 was amplified by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR), and sequenced. Open reading frame (ORF) of apr-1 was analyzed with ORF finder software. Chromosome locus was defined by genome blast software. Conserved domains of amino acids were analyzed by protein blast software. Align (Cluster W) software in Vector NTI software package was used to analyze homogeneous genes (or proteins), and to draw the Phylogenetic Tree. Subcellular localization of apr-1 was performed. RESULTS: apr-1 was mapped to chromosome Xp11.22 with the ORF locating in 1 exon. Two MAGE conserved domains were found in Apr-1. Apr-1 shared homology with MAGE-A1, MAGE-B1, MAGE-C1, MAGE-D1, and Necdin. Phylogenetic analysis showed that Apr-1 was more closely related to MAGE-D1 and Necdin.

Our observation of the opposite effect of verapamil on P-gp ATPase activity from DRM and solubilized-membrane fractions of CEM-resistant leukaemia cells, and results from Langmuir experiments on membrane monolayers from resistant CEM cells, strongly suggest that two functional populations of P-gp exist. The first is located in DRM regions: it displays its optimal P-gp ATPase activity, which is almost completely inhibited by orthovanadate and activated by verapamil. The second is located elsewhere in the membrane; it displays a lower P-gp ATPase activity that is less sensitive to orthovanadate and is inhibited by verapamil. A 40% cholesterol depletion of DRM caused the loss of 52% of the P-gp ATPase activity. Cholesterol repletion allowed recovery of the initial P-gp ATPase activity. In contrast, in the solubilized-membrane-containing fractions, cholesterol depletion and repletion had no effect on the P-gp ATPase activity whereas up to 100% saturation with cholesterol induced a 58% increased P-gp ATPase activity, while no significant modification was observed for the DRM-enriched fraction. DRMs were analysed by atomic force microscopy: 40-60% cholesterol depletion was necessary to remove P-gp from DRMs. In conclusion, P-gp in DRMs appears to contain closely surrounding cholesterol that can stimulate P-gp ATPase activity to its optimal value, whereas cholesterol in the second population seems deprived of this function.","['Barakat, Stephane', 'Gayet, Landry', 'Dayan, Guila', 'Labialle, Stephane', 'Lazar, Adina', 'Oleinikov, Vladimir', 'Coleman, Anthony W', 'Baggetto, Loris G']","['Barakat S', 'Gayet L', 'Dayan G', 'Labialle S', 'Lazar A', 'Oleinikov V', 'Coleman AW', 'Baggetto LG']","['Therapie transcriptionnelle des cellules cancereuses, IBCP-UMR 5086 CNRS UCBL, 7 Passage du Vercors, 69367 Lyon cedex 07, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Detergents)', '3WHH0066W5 (Vanadates)', '97C5T2UQ7J (Cholesterol)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (Adenosine Triphosphatases)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/chemistry/*physiology', 'Adenosine Triphosphatases/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Membrane/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Cholesterol/physiology', 'Detergents', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/physiology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Microscopy, Atomic Force', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma', 'Vanadates/pharmacology', 'Verapamil/pharmacology']",2005/02/08 09:00,2005/10/26 09:00,['2005/02/08 09:00'],"['2005/02/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/10/26 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['BJ20041999 [pii]', '10.1042/BJ20041999 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem J. 2005 Jun 1;388(Pt 2):563-71. doi: 10.1042/BJ20041999.,,,,,PMC1138964,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although variety of stimuli can drive leukemia --> DC differentiation in vitro, these blast-derived DCs typically have aberrant characteristics compared with DCs generated from normal progenitors by the same stimuli. It is not clear whether this is due to underlying leukemogenic mechanisms (e.g., specific oncogenes), genetic defects, stage of maturation arrest, defects in cytokine receptor expression or signal transduction pathways, or whether different stimuli themselves induce qualitatively dissimilar DC differentiation. METHODS: To assess what factors may contribute to aberrant leukemic blast --> DC differentiation, we have examined how the same leukemic blasts (AML and CML) respond to different DC differentiation signals--including extracellular (the cytokine combination GM-CSF + TNF-alpha + IL-4) and intracellular (the protein kinase C agonist PMA, the calcium ionophore A23187, and the combination of PMA plus A23187) stimuli. RESULTS: We have found that the same leukemic blasts will develop qualitatively different sets of DC characteristics in response to differing stimuli, although no stimuli consistently induced all of the characteristic DC features. There were no clear differences in the responses relative to specific oncogene expression or stage of maturation arrest (AML vs CML). Signal transduction agonists that bypassed membrane receptors/proximal signaling (in particular, the combination of PMA and A23187) consistently induced the greatest capability to activate T cells. Interestingly, this ability did not clearly correlate with expression of MHC/costimulatory ligands. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that signal transduction may play an important role in the aberrant DC differentiation of leukemic blasts, and demonstrate that direct activation of PKC together with intracellular calcium signaling may be an effective method for generating immunostimulatory leukemia-derived DCs.","['Kharfan-Dabaja, Mohamed', 'Ayala, Ernesto', 'Lindner, Inna', 'Cejas, Pedro J', 'Bahlis, Nizar J', 'Kolonias, Despina', 'Carlson, Louise M', 'Lee, Kelvin P']","['Kharfan-Dabaja M', 'Ayala E', 'Lindner I', 'Cejas PJ', 'Bahlis NJ', 'Kolonias D', 'Carlson LM', 'Lee KP']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Miami, Miami, FL 33136, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)']",IM,"['Antigens, Surface/genetics', 'Blast Crisis/genetics/immunology/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Lineage/genetics/immunology', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Dendritic Cells/cytology/immunology/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/immunology/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/immunology/*metabolism', 'Phenotype', 'Signal Transduction/genetics/immunology/physiology']",2005/02/05 09:00,2005/02/18 09:00,['2005/02/05 09:00'],"['2005/02/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/02/18 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/05 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00262-004-0562-4 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 2005 Jan;54(1):25-36. doi: 10.1007/s00262-004-0562-4.,,,,"['CA85208/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA95829/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we used both DNA microarray and proteomic approaches to investigate the effects of oligodeoxynucleotides containing the CpG motif (CpG-ODN) on gene transcription and protein expression profiles of CpG-ODN responsive THP-1 cells. Microarray analysis revealed that 2 h stimulation with CpG-ODN up-regulated 50 genes and down-regulated five genes. These genes were identified as being associated with inflammation, antimicrobial defense, transcriptional regulation, signal transduction, tumor progression, cell differentiation, proteolysis and metabolism. Longer stimulation (8 h) with CpG-ODN enhanced transcriptional expression of 58 genes. Among these 58 genes, none except one, namely WNTI inducible signaling pathway protein 2, was the same as those induced after 2 h stimulation. Proteomic analysis by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, followed by mass spectrometry identified several proteins up-regulated by CpG-ODN. These proteins included heat shock proteins, modulators of inflammation, metabolic proteins and energy pathway proteins. Comparison of microarray and proteomic expression profiles showed poor correlation. Use of more reliable and sensitive analyses, such as reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, Western blotting and functional assays, on several genes and proteins, nonetheless, confirmed that there is indeed good correlation between mRNA and protein expression after CpG-ODN treatment. This study also revealed that several anti-apoptotic and neuroprotective related proteins, not previously reported, are activated by CpG-DNA. These findings have extended our knowledge on the activation of cells by CpG-DNA and may contribute to further understanding of mechanisms that link innate immunity with acquired immune response(s).","['Kuo, Cheng-Chin', 'Kuo, Chu-Wei', 'Liang, Chi-Ming', 'Liang, Shu-Mei']","['Kuo CC', 'Kuo CW', 'Liang CM', 'Liang SM']","['Institute of BioAgricultural Sciences, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Germany,Proteomics,Proteomics,101092707,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Oligonucleotides)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '20350-15-6 (Brefeldin A)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)', 'EC 3.4.21.4 (Trypsin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Brefeldin A/pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*CpG Islands', 'DNA, Complementary/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genetic Therapy/*methods', 'Humans', 'Image Processing, Computer-Assisted', 'Immunoblotting', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/*therapy', 'Luciferases/metabolism', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Mice', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Oligonucleotides/*genetics', 'Proteomics/*methods', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Time Factors', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection', 'Trypsin/pharmacology', 'Up-Regulation']",2005/02/05 09:00,2005/09/02 09:00,['2005/02/05 09:00'],"['2005/02/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/02 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/05 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pmic.200401144 [doi]'],ppublish,Proteomics. 2005 Mar;5(4):894-906. doi: 10.1002/pmic.200401144.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, both prevention and treatment of established graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), including with drugs such as cyclosporine, can suppress GVL effects. Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) is becoming a standard of care in SCT recipients for better prevention of GVHD as well as for promoting stem cell engraftment. AIMS: To evaluate the effect of MMF, an immunosuppressive drug increasingly used for prevention of GVHD, on disease recurrence following SCT in a preclinical animal model. Since GVL effects may be also induced by alloreactive natural killer (NK) cells, the goal was to investigate the effects of MMF on the activity of lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells. METHODS: MMF was administered by daily intraperitoneal injection starting at day 1 post-SCT. Cytotoxic LAK activity was measured by 5-h 35S-release assay, and GVL was tested by the appearance of BCL1 leukemia in a semi-mismatched (C57BL/6 donors to [BALB/c x C57BL/6] F1 recipients) murine model. RESULTS: A dosage regimen of 28-200 mg/kg per day MMF had no negative effect on either cytotoxic LAK activity or GVL (as measured by finding of leukemic cells in recipient spleen by PCR or the appearance of clinical leukemia with adoptive transfer). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that MMF does not impair GVL effects or reduce LAK cell activity in mice.","['Shapira, Michael Y', 'Hirshfeld, Ester', 'Weiss, Lola', 'Zeira, Michael', 'Kasir, Judith', 'Or, Reuven', 'Resnick, Igor B', 'Slavin, Shimon']","['Shapira MY', 'Hirshfeld E', 'Weiss L', 'Zeira M', 'Kasir J', 'Or R', 'Resnick IB', 'Slavin S']","['Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation and Cancer Immunotherapy, Hadassah-Hebrew University Medical Center, PO Box 12000, 91120, Jerusalem, Israel. shapiram@hadassah.org.il']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20041103,Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)', 'HU9DX48N0T (Mycophenolic Acid)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cyclin D1/genetics/metabolism', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/*drug effects', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Injections, Intraperitoneal', 'Interleukin-2/*immunology/pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Lymphokine-Activated/*drug effects/transplantation', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/immunology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mycophenolic Acid/*administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives', '*Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Survival Rate', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology/transplantation', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",2005/02/05 09:00,2005/03/30 09:00,['2005/02/05 09:00'],"['2004/02/10 00:00 [received]', '2004/08/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/02/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/30 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/05 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00262-004-0614-9 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 2005 Apr;54(4):383-8. doi: 10.1007/s00262-004-0614-9.

It remains elusive whether the acquisition of the MDR phenotype alters immunological parameters that could influence the cell sensitivity to an eventual host immune response. We report that immunisation of syngeneic mice with gamma-irradiated L1210S (parental line) and L1210R (MDR phenotype) cells results in a significant rejection of subsequently implanted L1210R-based tumours, but not of the L1210S ones. Notably, L1210R tumours display a twofold reduction in vivo proliferative capacity and are less aggressive in terms of mouse survival than their sensitive counterparts. Also, analysis of surface expression of molecules involved in antigen presentation and cytokine activity revealed a slight increase in IFN-gamma receptor expression, a decrease of Fas molecule, and a fourfold up-regulation of MHC class I molecules in L1210R cells. Nonetheless, both cell lines were able to induce a cytotoxic response in syngeneic mice and were equally susceptible to cytotoxicity by splenic cells. Together, these findings indicate that acquisition of drug resistance by L1210 cells is accompanied by pleiotropic changes that result in reduced tumour proliferative capacity and tumorigenicity in syngeneic mice. Hence, immunological studies of MDR tumours may assist in the design of specific therapeutic strategies that complement current chemotherapy treatments.","['Martin-Orozco, Elena', 'Ferragut, Jose Antonio', 'Garcia-Penarrubia, Pilar', 'Ferrer-Montiel, Antonio']","['Martin-Orozco E', 'Ferragut JA', 'Garcia-Penarrubia P', 'Ferrer-Montiel A']","['Instituto de Biologia Molecular y Celular, Edificio Torregaitan, Universidad Miguel Hernandez, Avenida Ferrocarril s/n, 03202 Elche, Alicante, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20041204,Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Receptors, Interferon)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '07MXG07O12 (interferon gamma receptor)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/toxicity', 'Antigen Presentation', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Daunorubicin/toxicity', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/*physiology', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Gamma Rays/adverse effects', 'Leukemia L1210/*drug therapy/*immunology/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Receptors, Interferon/metabolism', 'Survival Rate', 'fas Receptor/metabolism']",2005/02/05 09:00,2005/03/30 09:00,['2005/02/05 09:00'],"['2004/01/19 00:00 [received]', '2004/06/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/02/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/30 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/05 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00262-004-0588-7 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 2005 Apr;54(4):328-36. doi: 10.1007/s00262-004-0588-7.

To overcome this problem of molecular persistence, research is underway to combine reduced intensity stem cell transplant or non-donor-dependent immunotherapies with IM with the aim of increasing cure rate, reducing toxicity and improving quality of life. The alternative approach is to combine IM or second-generation agents with other novel drugs that interrupt key signalling pathways activated by Bcr-Abl.

CASE: A complete clinical ophthalmologic examination was performed in this patient along with fluorescein angiography. OBSERVATIONS: After being checked for diffuse adenopathies, myodesopsias, and phosphenes, the 35-year-old patient was diagnosed with ATL. The ocular impairment, present since the onset of ATL as peripheral subretinal infiltrates, spread progressively and afferently to the rest of the retina in the form of an essentially venous vasculitis. Impairment of the vitreous was noted only in the end stages of disease progression. As ocular lesions progressed, the general state of the patient degraded at the same time despite chemotherapeutic measures. CONCLUSION: Among the more than 300 seropositive for human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) or patients with HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis treated at our hospital in the last 20 years, and among the 83 cases of ATL, only this single case of retinal vasculitis associated with HTLV-1 was observed (1/83, 1.2%) in Martinique, confirming the geographic variability of the clinical phenotype of HTLV-1 infection. The incidence of retinal vasculitis in ATL patients may signify an even worse prognosis than initially indicated.","['Merle, Harold', 'Donnio, Angelique', 'Gonin, Claire', 'Jean-Charles, Albert', 'Panelatti, Gerard', 'Plumelle, Yves']","['Merle H', 'Donnio A', 'Gonin C', 'Jean-Charles A', 'Panelatti G', 'Plumelle Y']","[""Service d'Ophtalmologie, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Fort-de-France, Martinique, French West Indies. harold.merle@chu-fortdefrance.fr""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,Japan,Jpn J Ophthalmol,Japanese journal of ophthalmology,0044652,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (HTLV-I Antibodies)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antiviral Agents/therapeutic use', 'Blotting, Western', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Female', 'Fluorescein Angiography', 'HTLV-I Antibodies/blood', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/immunology/*isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*complications/diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Leukemic Infiltration', 'Retina/pathology', 'Retinal Vasculitis/diagnosis/drug therapy/*etiology']",2005/02/05 09:00,2005/03/15 09:00,['2005/02/05 09:00'],"['2004/02/24 00:00 [received]', '2004/06/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/02/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/15 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/05 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s10384-004-0144-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Jpn J Ophthalmol. 2005 Jan-Feb;49(1):41-5. doi: 10.1007/s10384-004-0144-1.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Accordingly, considerable efforts are now being directed toward development and use of vectors capable of replicating in cancer cells. However, for replicating retroviruses, insertion of additional reading frames into the viral genome often resulted in the generation of unstable viruses. Here, we report a novel concept for the generation of replication-competent murine leukemia virus (MLV) vectors capable of mediating the secretion of soluble therapeutic proteins from infected cells. As a proof of principle, we inserted transgene regions encoding either a single-chain variable region fragment (scFv), here, the laminin-specific L36-scFv, or the T-cell-specific 7A5-scFv, or the cytokine GM-CSF into the MLV envelope (env) gene after +1 codon of the envelope (Env) protein, followed by a sequence specifying a furin protease cleavage site. The resulting viruses, termed L36-furin-A, 7A5-furin-A and GMCSF-furin-Mo, respectively, infected a variety of human cell lines, including HMEC-1 (endothelial), A301 (lymphoid), MDA-MB231 and MDA-MB468 (breast cancer) and HT1080 (fibrosarcoma) cells. Western blot analysis of conditioned culture medium from HT1080 cells infected by replicating L36-furin A, as an example, revealed that more than 90% of the Env fusion protein molecules were indeed intracellularly cleaved. After 5 days of infection, up to 3-4 mug/ml of soluble L36-scFv accumulated in the supernatant of HT1080 cells. The eukaryotically produced L36-scFv and 7A5-scFv were able to recognize their native antigens with high avidity, as assessed by ELISA and flow cytometry. Furthermore, the replicating viruses were genetically stable for more than 12 cell passages. In conclusion, a new generation of replication-competent retroviral vectors capable of mediating long-term and efficient secretion of therapeutic proteins suitable for cancer therapy was generated.","['Finger, Carsten', 'Sun, Yuansheng', 'Sanz, Laura', 'Alvarez-Vallina, Luis', 'Buchholz, Christian J', 'Cichutek, Klaus']","['Finger C', 'Sun Y', 'Sanz L', 'Alvarez-Vallina L', 'Buchholz CJ', 'Cichutek K']","['Division of Medical Biotechnology, Paul-Ehrlich-Institut, 63225 Langen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Cancer Gene Ther,Cancer gene therapy,9432230,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Genetic Therapy/*methods', 'Genetic Vectors/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/metabolism/therapeutic use', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasms/*metabolism/therapy', 'Plasmids/genetics', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', '*Virus Replication']",2005/02/05 09:00,2005/08/05 09:00,['2005/02/05 09:00'],"['2005/02/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/05 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['7700805 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.cgt.7700805 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Gene Ther. 2005 May;12(5):464-74. doi: 10.1038/sj.cgt.7700805.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Precise diagnosis of the main forms of hematopoietic malignancies and comparison of these data with those in the general population will be helpful in estimating thr relative contribution of the radiation factor to the overall incidence of such pathologies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In all, 187 consecutive cases of malignant diseases of hematopoietic and lymphoid tissues in Chernobyl clean-up workers were analyzed in Ukrainian Reference Laboratory in 1996-2003. A total of 1942 consecutive patients of general population, mainly the residents of Kyiv city and district, diagnosed in References Laboratory at the same period comprised the group of comparison. The morphology and cytochemistry of bone marrow and peripheral blood cells were studied. Immunocytochemical techniques (PAP, APAAP, ABC) and the panel of monoclonal antibodies to differentiation antigens of leukocytes were employed for immunophenotyping leukemic cells. RESULTS: Various types of malignant disease of hematopoietic and lymphoid tissues were registered in Chernobyl clean-up workers under study including myelodysplastic syndromes (nine patients), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (eight) and acute myeloblastic leukemia (31), chromic myeloid leukemia (17), multiple myeloma (17) and other forms of chromic myeloproliferative and lymphoproliferative disease including B-cell chromic lymphocytic leukemia (49 patients). CONCLUSION: The verified diagnosis of tumors of hematopoietic malignancies according to modern classification (EGIL, WHO) could be the prerequisite for further analytical epidemiology study of leukemias that may be related to the Chernobyl accident.","['Gluzman, Daniel', 'Imamura, Nobutaka', 'Sklyarenko, Lylia', 'Nadgornaya, Valentina', 'Zavelevich, Michael', 'Machilo, Vasily']","['Gluzman D', 'Imamura N', 'Sklyarenko L', 'Nadgornaya V', 'Zavelevich M', 'Machilo V']","['RE Kavetsky Institute of Experimental Pathology, Oncology and Radiobiology, National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine, Kyiv, Ukraine. vals@onconet.kiev.ua']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Hematol J,The hematology journal : the official journal of the European Haematology Association,100965523,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*diagnostic imaging/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology', 'Lymphoma/diagnostic imaging/*epidemiology', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/diagnostic imaging/epidemiology', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology', 'Radiation Injuries/*epidemiology', '*Radioactive Hazard Release', 'Radionuclide Imaging', 'Ukraine/epidemiology']",2005/02/05 09:00,2005/07/07 09:00,['2005/02/05 09:00'],"['2005/02/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/07 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['6200568 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.thj.6200568 [doi]']",ppublish,Hematol J. 2005;5(7):565-71. doi: 10.1038/sj.thj.6200568.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The in vitro cytotoxicity of a novel cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, CYC202, was evaluated in 26 B-CLLs, 11 with mutations in either the ATM or TP53 genes, and compared with that induced by ionizing radiation and fludarabine. CYC202 induced apoptosis within 24 hours of treatment in all 26 analyzed tumor samples independently of ATM and TP53 gene status, whereas 6 of 26 B-CLLs, mostly ATM mutant, showed marked in vitro resistance to fludarabine-induced apoptosis. Compared with B-CLLs, normal T and B lymphocytes treated with CYC202 displayed reduced and delayed apoptosis. Using global gene expression profiling, we found that CYC202 caused a significant down-regulation of genes involved in regulation of transcription, translation, survival, and DNA repair. Furthermore, induction of apoptosis by CYC202 was preceded by inhibition of RNA polymerase II phosphorylation, leading to down-regulation of several prosurvival proteins. We conclude that CYC202 is a potent inducer of apoptosis in B-CLL regardless of the functional status of the p53 pathway, and may be considered as a therapeutic agent to improve the outcome of resistant B-CLL tumors.","['Alvi, Azra J', 'Austen, Belinda', 'Weston, Victoria J', 'Fegan, Christopher', 'MacCallum, David', 'Gianella-Borradori, Athos', 'Lane, David P', 'Hubank, Mike', 'Powell, Judith E', 'Wei, Wenbin', 'Taylor, A Malcolm R', 'Moss, Paul A H', 'Stankovic, Tatjana']","['Alvi AJ', 'Austen B', 'Weston VJ', 'Fegan C', 'MacCallum D', 'Gianella-Borradori A', 'Lane DP', 'Hubank M', 'Powell JE', 'Wei W', 'Taylor AM', 'Moss PA', 'Stankovic T']","['Cancer Research UK Institute for Cancer Studies, University of Birmingham, B15 2TT, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20050203,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Purines)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0ES1C2KQ94 (Roscovitine)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (ATM protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (RNA Polymerase II)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/genetics', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/genetics', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Down-Regulation/*drug effects/genetics', 'Drug Evaluation', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/genetics/*pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/genetics', 'Purines/*pharmacology', 'RNA Polymerase II/metabolism', 'Roscovitine', 'Transcription, Genetic/*drug effects/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics']",2005/02/05 09:00,2005/07/13 09:00,['2005/02/05 09:00'],"['2005/02/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)53492-7 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2004-07-2713 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2005 Jun 1;105(11):4484-91. doi: 10.1182/blood-2004-07-2713.

Here, we examined the effect of both factors on high-affinity choline uptake (HACU) and on expression of the high-affinity choline transporter CHT1. We found that HACU and CHT1-mRNA levels are up-regulated by LIF and down-regulated by RA in these neurons. Thus, in contrast to LIF, RA differentially regulates the expression of the presynaptic cholinergic proteins. Moreover, we showed that untreated SCG neurons express HACU and CHT1-mRNAs at much higher levels than ChAT activity and transcripts. In intact SCG, CHT1-mRNAs are abundant and synthesized by the noradrenergic neurons themselves. This study provides the first example of CHT1 expression in neurons which do not use acetylcholine as neurotransmitter.","['Lecomte, Marie-Jose', 'De Gois, Stephanie', 'Guerci, Aline', 'Ravassard, Philippe', 'Faucon Biguet, Nicole', 'Mallet, Jacques', 'Berrard, Sylvie']","['Lecomte MJ', 'De Gois S', 'Guerci A', 'Ravassard P', 'Faucon Biguet N', 'Mallet J', 'Berrard S']","[""Laboratoire de la Neurotransmission et des Processus Neurodegeneratifs, CNRS, UMR 7091, Batiment CERVI, Hopital de la Pitie-Salpetriere, 83 boulevard de l'Hopital, 75013 Paris, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Mol Cell Neurosci,Molecular and cellular neurosciences,9100095,"['0 (CHT1 protein, rat)', '0 (Cation Transport Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 2.3.1.6 (Choline O-Acetyltransferase)', 'N91BDP6H0X (Choline)', 'N9YNS0M02X (Acetylcholine)', 'X4W3ENH1CV (Norepinephrine)']",IM,"['Acetylcholine/*biosynthesis', 'Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Cation Transport Proteins/*genetics', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/*physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Choline/metabolism', 'Choline O-Acetyltransferase/*genetics', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects/physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects/physiology', 'Interleukin-6/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Neurons/cytology/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Norepinephrine/metabolism', 'Phenotype', 'RNA, Messenger/drug effects/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Superior Cervical Ganglion/cytology/growth & development/*metabolism', 'Tretinoin/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects/physiology']",2005/02/05 09:00,2005/06/29 09:00,['2005/02/05 09:00'],"['2004/06/10 00:00 [received]', '2004/09/17 00:00 [revised]', '2004/09/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/02/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/29 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1044-7431(04)00235-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.mcn.2004.09.014 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Neurosci. 2005 Feb;28(2):303-13. doi: 10.1016/j.mcn.2004.09.014.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

LMO2 is necessary for development of the entire hematopoietic system and overexpression of LMO1 or LMO2 results in human acute T cell leukemia. LMO4 is the most widely expressed LMO but its normal function is unknown. During development, LMO4 is expressed in dividing neuroepithelial cells within the ventricular zone along the entire rostrocaudal axis of the nervous system. In telencephalic and spinal cord regions of the CNS, LMO4 is highly expressed in ventral but is low in dorsal proliferating neuroepithelial cells. To understand the role of LMO4 during mouse development, we generated a homozygous null mutation in the gene. We found that LMO4 is required for proper closure of the anterior neural tube. In the absence of LMO4, elevation, bending, and proliferation of the ventral neural epithelium and consequent fusion of the prospective dorsal ends of the neural tube do not occur. LMO4 mutant mice die embryonically and exhibit exencephaly, which is associated with abnormal patterns of cell proliferation and with high levels of apoptotic cell death within the neuroepithelium. LMO4 is thus essential for normal patterns of proliferation and for survival of neural epithelial cells in the rostral neural tube. LMO4 is also expressed in Schwann cell progenitors after these contact neurites, a process mediated in part by neuregulin (Nrg).","['Lee, Soo-Kyung', 'Jurata, Linda W', 'Nowak, Roberta', 'Lettieri, Karen', 'Kenny, Daryn A', 'Pfaff, Samuel L', 'Gill, Gordon N']","['Lee SK', 'Jurata LW', 'Nowak R', 'Lettieri K', 'Kenny DA', 'Pfaff SL', 'Gill GN']","['Gene Expression Laboratory, Salk Institute, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Mol Cell Neurosci,Molecular and cellular neurosciences,9100095,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (LIM Domain Proteins)', '0 (Lmo4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Neuregulin-1)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'Body Patterning/genetics', 'Cell Communication/physiology', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Central Nervous System/*abnormalities/*metabolism/physiopathology', 'Epithelial Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental/*genetics', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics', 'LIM Domain Proteins', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Nervous System Malformations/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Neural Crest/cytology/embryology/metabolism', 'Neuregulin-1/metabolism', 'Neurons/cytology/metabolism', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary/genetics', 'Schwann Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Stem Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics']",2005/02/05 09:00,2005/06/29 09:00,['2005/02/05 09:00'],"['2004/01/21 00:00 [received]', '2004/04/23 00:00 [revised]', '2004/04/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/02/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/29 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1044743104001046 [pii]', '10.1016/j.mcn.2004.04.010 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Neurosci. 2005 Feb;28(2):205-14. doi: 10.1016/j.mcn.2004.04.010.,,,,"['DK13149/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01NS37116/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

HTLV-I transmission can be either horizontal through cell-to-cell contact, or vertical through mitotic division of infected CD4+ T cells. It has been observed that HTLV-I infection has a high proviral load but a low rate of proviral genetic variation. This suggests that vertical transmission through mitotic division of infected cells may play an important role. We consider and analyze a mathematical model for HTLV-I infection of CD4+ T cells that incorporates both horizontal and vertical transmission.

More recently, it has been shown that deregulation of ZAP-70 activity can induce autoimmune diseases. Finally, ZAP-70 expression has been shown in some B chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and correlated with bad prognosis of the disease. The diversity of pathologies associated with deregulation of ZAP-70 demonstrates its key role in immune responses.

In heavily pretreated patients this MAb is able to produce response rates of about 40%, and in symptomatic, previously untreated patients response rates of more than 80% can be achieved. Alemtuzumab can also be used in patients with CLL as a preparative regimen for stem cell transplantation (SCT) and to prevent graft versus host disease. Moreover its in vivo use before or after SCT may also potentially result in depletion of residual leukemia cells, especially in the autologous setting. Adverse events associated with alemtuzumab include acute first-dose reaction, hematologic toxicity, and infectious complications. Usually they are predictable, manageable, and acceptable in the context of CLL. However, in a significant percentage of patients, cytomegalovirus reactivation occurs during alemtuzumab therapy, and routine weekly monitoring with the polymerase chain reaction methodology is indicated.

Recent advances have provided important insight into the pathogenesis of these disorders, and they provide a molecular basis for a clinically meaningful classification of primary megakaryoblastic disorders in the pediatric age group.","['Lorsbach, Robert B']",['Lorsbach RB'],"[""Department of Pathology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105, USA. robert.lorsbach@stjude.org""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,England,Am J Clin Pathol,American journal of clinical pathology,0370470,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Down Syndrome/complications', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/diagnosis', 'Male', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Thrombopoiesis', 'Translocation, Genetic']",2005/02/05 09:00,2005/02/19 09:00,['2005/02/05 09:00'],"['2005/02/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/02/19 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/05 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1309/Y57UGTE36PGQ2NV6 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Clin Pathol. 2004 Dec;122 Suppl:S33-46. doi: 10.1309/Y57UGTE36PGQ2NV6.,85,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The mechanism underlying the carcinogenicity of benzene is unknown, although a number of genetic changes including chromosomal aberrations have been associated with benzene toxicity. Metabolism of benzene is required for the induced toxicological effects. We have investigated the effect of trans,trans-muconaldehyde (MUC), hydroquinone (HQ), and four MUC metabolites on gap-junction intercellular communication (GJIC). Inhibition of GJIC has been considered a possible predictor of tumor promoters and non-genotoxic carcinogens, and shown to result in perturbation of hematopoiesis. MUC was found to be a strong inhibitor of GJIC (EC50=12 micromol L(-1)) in rat liver epithelial cells IAR20, with potency similar to that of chlordane (EC50=7 micromol L(-1)). HQ inhibited GJIC with an EC50 of 25 micromolmol L(-1), and the metabolite OH/CHO with an EC50 of 58 micromol L(-1). The other MUC metabolites tested, CHO/COOH and OH/COOH were weak inhibitors of GJIC whereas COOH/COOH had no effect. Benzene itself had no effect on GJIC when tested in concentrations up to 20 micromol L(-1). The relative potency observed for the metabolites on GJIC is similar to their hematotoxic effects. The effect of MUC on GJIC was observed to take place concordant with a dramatic loss of connexin 43 (Cx43) from the cells as visualized by Western blotting. Substances with the ability to inhibit Cx43-dependent GJIC have previously been observed to interfere with normal hematopoietic development. The ability of benzene metabolites to interfere with gap-junction functionality, and especially the dramatic loss of Cx43 induced by MUC, should therefore be considered as a possible mechanism for benzene-induced hematotoxicity and development of leukemia.","['Rivedal, Edgar', 'Witz, Gisela']","['Rivedal E', 'Witz G']","['Institute for Cancer Research, The Norwegian Radium Hospital, Montebello, 0310, Oslo, Norway. edgarr@labmed.uio.no']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20050203,Germany,Arch Toxicol,Archives of toxicology,0417615,"['0 (Connexin 43)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Benzene/metabolism/*toxicity', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Communication/*drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Connexin 43/metabolism', 'Epithelial Cells/cytology/*drug effects', 'Gap Junctions/*drug effects', 'Liver/cytology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases/metabolism', 'Rats']",2005/02/04 09:00,2005/10/18 09:00,['2005/02/04 09:00'],"['2004/07/14 00:00 [received]', '2004/11/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/02/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/10/18 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/04 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00204-004-0638-0 [doi]'],ppublish,Arch Toxicol. 2005 Jun;79(6):303-11. doi: 10.1007/s00204-004-0638-0.

In this study, we demonstrated that Bcl-2 was constitutively phosphorylated in several hematopoietic tumor cell lines and in primary ALL cells. Increased phosphorylation of Bcl-2 protein in the JM1 ALL cell line, achieved by expression of the phosphomimetic Bcl-2 construct S70E, enhanced JM1 cell chemoresistance. In contrast, initiation of JM1 cell apoptosis was coincident with dephosphorylation of Bcl-2 and elevated protein phosphatase 2A activity. S70E expression also diminished tBid-mediated cytochrome c release and blunted chemotherapy-induced activation of caspases-9 and -3 in JM1 cells. To determine whether soluble factors produced by stromal cells in the bone marrow influence phosphorylation of Bcl-2 protein, a panel of recombinant cytokines was evaluated. Of those tested, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) induced phosphorylation of Bcl-2 protein and blunted cytochrome c release during chemotherapy or tBid treatment of ALL cells. In contrast, JM1 cells transfected with S70A, resulting in expression of Bcl-2 protein that cannot be phosphorylated, were not efficiently rescued from apoptosis by VEGF. These observations suggest that optimal protection of leukemic cells by VEGF may require activation of a pathway that includes Bcl-2 phosphorylation.","['Wang, L', 'Chen, L', 'Benincosa, J', 'Fortney, J', 'Gibson, L F']","['Wang L', 'Chen L', 'Benincosa J', 'Fortney J', 'Gibson LF']","['Department of Pediatrics, Robert C.

For ALL, both ED and CRM declined over time, although this was not statistically significant. For AML a decrease in ED was observed (from 26% to approximately 10%), but counter-balanced by an increase in CRM (from 3 to 8%), maybe related to the scheduling of intensification blocks in AML-92/94. Including transplant-related mortality, death in CR rates in AML increased from 3 to 15% in the last study. The main cause of ED was hemorrhage, often associated with hyperleucocytosis, and infection for CRM. We conclude that mortality dropped favorably in ALL, but not in AML.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We evaluated semen quality in 314 patients over a 26 year period. The diagnostic categories were leukaemia (n = 13); lymphoma (n = 128); testicular cancer (n = 102); benign conditions (n = 13); and other malignant neoplasms (n = 58). The degree of azoospermia or oligozoospermia for each disease category was recorded. We then analysed the recovery in semen quality over time for each disease category. RESULTS: The mean patient age was 27.9 years (range 13-65 years). A total of 1115 post-treatment semen samples were analysed from 314 patients. There was a significant reduction in the post-treatment sperm concentration, sperm motility and semen volume compared with pre-treatment levels (P < 0.05) in the entire cohort. However, the sperm movement and motility grade remained unaffected. Patients with testicular carcinoma had the lowest pre-treatment sperm concentrations but also the lowest incidence of azoospermia after cancer treatment. Patients with lymphoma and leukaemia had the highest incidence of post-treatment azoospermia and oligospermia. Patients having the largest reductions in their sperm concentration after treatment required the longest recovery period for spermatogenesis. The diagnostic category was the only significant predictor of post-treatment azoospermia. CONCLUSION: Gonadotoxic treatment results in a significant reduction in sperm quality. The type of cancer or disease, and the pre-treatment sperm concentrations were found to be the most significant factors governing post-treatment semen quality and recovery of spermatogenesis. All categories of patients displayed varying degrees of azoospermia and oligozoospermia, and recovery of gonadal function from these states was not significant. This highlights the importance of ensuring sperm banking before treatment, including for patients with benign conditions. Several factors and associations are discussed further in order to give an insight into the pre- and post-gonadotoxic treatment effects.","['Bahadur, G', 'Ozturk, O', 'Muneer, A', 'Wafa, R', 'Ashraf, A', 'Jaman, N', 'Patel, S', 'Oyede, A W', 'Ralph, D J']","['Bahadur G', 'Ozturk O', 'Muneer A', 'Wafa R', 'Ashraf A', 'Jaman N', 'Patel S', 'Oyede AW', 'Ralph DJ']","['Fertility and Reproductive Medicine Laboratories, Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Royal Free and University College Medical School, University College Hospitals Trust, Rosenheim Building, 25 Grafton Way, London WC1E 6DB, UK. g.bahadur@ucl.ac.uk']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20050202,England,Hum Reprod,"Human reproduction (Oxford, England)",8701199,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Cohort Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy', 'Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/complications/*drug therapy/pathology/*physiopathology', 'Oligospermia/chemically induced/etiology/pathology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Semen/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Sperm Count', 'Sperm Motility/drug effects', 'Spermatozoa/*drug effects', 'Testicular Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Time Factors']",2005/02/04 09:00,2005/07/22 09:00,['2005/02/04 09:00'],"['2005/02/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/22 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['deh671 [pii]', '10.1093/humrep/deh671 [doi]']",ppublish,Hum Reprod. 2005 Mar;20(3):774-81. doi: 10.1093/humrep/deh671.

The recent description of the development of resistance to IM and the discovery of the underlying Abl-kinase mutations as a principal mechanism of resistance prompted a major research effort to understand the pathophysiology of the resistance phenomenon and stimulated the implementation of new algorithms for the treatment.","['Turhan, Ali G']",['Turhan AG'],"['Departement of Medicine, Division of Hematology and Translational Research Laboratory in Cell Therapy, 39 rue Camille Desmoulins 94805 Villejuif Cedex France. turali@igr.fr']",['fre'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",,France,Bull Cancer,Bulletin du cancer,0072416,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Forecasting', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Genes, abl/genetics', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Interferon-alpha/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/*therapy', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Stem Cell Transplantation']",2005/02/04 09:00,2005/02/16 09:00,['2005/02/04 09:00'],"['2004/11/08 00:00 [received]', '2004/12/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/02/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/02/16 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/04 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Bull Cancer. 2005 Jan;92(1):75-82.,31,,Leucemie myeloide chronique: actualites biologiques et therapeutiques.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A prospective study was conducted to determine the diagnostic value of ADA activity in bronchoalveolar lavage.

All patients were either sputum-smear negative for AFB or failed to produce sputum. The final diagnosis resulted in three patient groups: 43 with pulmonary tuberculosis, 70 malignancy, and 35 miscellaneous causes. The mean ADA activity in the bronchoalveolar lavage for the pulmonary tuberculosis, malignancy, and miscellaneous causes groups was 8.98 (95% CI, 3.79-14.17), 7.63 (95% CI, 4.12-11.14), and 11.61 U/l (95% CI, 3.59-19.62), respectively. No difference was detected in the ADA level in the pulmonary tuberculosis vs other groups (p=0.56, one-way ANOVA). A high level of ADA activity was found in non-tuberculous conditions such as bronchogenic carcinoma, pulmonary hemosiderosis, chronic pneumonia with empyema thoracis and chronic myeloid leukemia. We concluded that ADA activity in the bronchoalveolar lavage was not clearly diagnostic of smear-negative pulmonary tuberculosis.

Trabectedin has shown clinical antitumor activity in refractory soft tissue sarcoma and ovarian cancer. The lack of cross resistance of trabectedin with other chemotherapeutic drugs is presumably related to its peculiar mode of action, that seems to be related to a promoter-dependent transcription modulation. Aplidine is a potent pro-apoptotic inducer in human leukemia and has antiangiogenic properties. These examples support the view that more research should be carried out to investigate new natural marine products since there are compounds among them with antitumor properties.

Year by year the intensity of therapy (CT and RT) was gradually adjusted to the risk-factor groups, and invasive methods of staging were also gradually limited. Supportive care was improved at the same time. Along with the modified therapy protocol, five consecutive periods of time (I: 1971-82; II: 1983-87; IIII: 1988-93; IV: 1994-96; V: 1997-2001) were analyzed.

Conversely, a protected social environment, higher level of education and growing up in families with a low number of children are considered as risk factors. Additional risk factors involve agricultural occupation of the parents and exposure to several other occupational factors. These data led to a number of hypotheses that attempted to explain the epidemiologic observations; however, a number of questions are still open. Here we propose a new concept that could explain most of the epidemiologic characteristics. This concept is based on the assumption that persistent infections with TT virus-like agents increase the risk for specific chromosomal translocations. This risk should correlate with the viral load.

RA treatment induces epigenetic modifications at its target loci and restores myeloid differentiation of APL blasts. Using RA-sensitive and RA-resistant APL cell lines and primary blasts, we addressed the functional relevance of the aberrant methylation status at the RA-target promoter RARbeta2 and the mechanism by which methylation is reversed by RA. RA decreased DNMT expression and activity, which correlated with demethylation at specific sites on RARbeta2 promoter/exon-1, and the ability of APL blasts to differentiate in vitro and in vivo. None of these events occurred in an RA-resistant APL cell line containing a PML-RARalpha defective for ligand binding. The specific contribution of the HDAC and DNMT pathways to the response of APL cells to RA was also tested by inhibiting these enzymatic activities with TSA and/or 5-azacytidine. In RA-responsive and RA-resistant APL blasts, TSA and 5-azacytidine induced specific changes on the chromatin state at RA-target sites, increased the RA effect on promoter activity, endogenous RA-target gene expression and differentiation.

Megakaryoblasts from Down syndrome AML patients are more sensitive in vitro to ara-C than cells from non-Down syndrome AML patients. Somatic mutations in the GATA1 transcription factor have been detected exclusively and almost uniformly in Down syndrome AMkL patients, suggesting a potential linkage to the chemotherapy sensitivity of Down syndrome megakaryoblasts. Stable transfection of wild-type GATA1 cDNA into the Down syndrome AMkL cell line CMK resulted in decreased (8- to 17-fold) ara-C sensitivity and a threefold-lower generation of the active ara-C metabolite ara-CTP compared with that for mock-transfected CMK cells. High intracellular levels of uridine arabinoside (ara-U) (an inactive ara-C catabolite generated by cytidine deaminase) and cytidine deaminase transcripts were detected in GATA1-transfected CMK sublines, whereas no ara-U was detected in mock-transfected cells. Cytidine deaminase transcripts were a median 5.1-fold (P = .002) lower in Down syndrome megakaryoblasts (n = 16) than in blast cells from non-Down syndrome patients (n = 56). These results suggest that GATA1 transcriptionally upregulates cytidine deaminase and that the presence or absence of GATA1 mutations in AML blasts likely confers differences in ara-C sensitivities due to effects on cytidine deaminase gene expression, which, in turn, contributes to the high cure rate of Down syndrome AMkL patients.","['Ge, Yubin', 'Stout, Mark L', 'Tatman, Dana A', 'Jensen, Tanya L', 'Buck, Steven', 'Thomas, Ronald L', 'Ravindranath, Yaddanapudi', 'Matherly, Larry H', 'Taub, Jeffrey W']","['Ge Y', 'Stout ML', 'Tatman DA', 'Jensen TL', 'Buck S', 'Thomas RL', 'Ravindranath Y', 'Matherly LH', 'Taub JW']","['Experimental and Clinical Therapeutics Program, Barbara Ann Karmanos Cancer Institute, Detroit, MI, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors)', '0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA1 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '13191-15-6 (Arabinofuranosylcytosine Triphosphate)', '3083-77-0 (Arabinofuranosyluracil)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (Cytidine Deaminase)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/metabolism', 'Arabinofuranosylcytosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Arabinofuranosyluracil/metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'Child', 'Cytarabine/metabolism', 'Cytidine Deaminase/genetics/*metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Down Syndrome/*complications/genetics/*metabolism', 'Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/complications/enzymology/genetics/*metabolism', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Time Factors', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Up-Regulation']",2005/02/03 09:00,2005/02/16 09:00,['2005/02/03 09:00'],"['2005/02/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/02/16 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['97/3/226 [pii]', '10.1093/jnci/dji026 [doi]']",ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 2005 Feb 2;97(3):226-31. doi: 10.1093/jnci/dji026.,,,,['R01 CA92308/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

One hypothesis holds that exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation increases lymphoma risk. We tested this hypothesis in a population-based case-control study in Denmark and Sweden. METHODS: A total of 3740 patients diagnosed between October 1, 1999, and August 30, 2002, with incident malignant lymphomas, including non-Hodgkin lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and Hodgkin lymphoma, and 3187 population controls provided detailed information on history of UV exposure and skin cancer and information on other possible risk factors for lymphomas. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by logistic regression. Statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: Multivariable-adjusted analyses revealed consistent, statistically significant negative associations between various measures of UV light exposure and risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. A high frequency of sun bathing and sunburns at age 20 years and 5-10 years before the interview and sun vacations abroad were associated with 30%-40% reduced risks of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (e.g., for sunbathing four times a week or more at age 20 versus never sunbathing, OR = 0.7, 95% CI = 0.6 to 0.9; for two or more sunburns a year at age 20 versus no sunburns, OR = 0.6, 95% CI = 0.5 to 0.8). These inverse associations increased in strength with increasing levels of exposure (all P(trend)< or =.01). Similar, albeit weaker, associations were observed for Hodgkin lymphoma. There were no clear differences among non-Hodgkin lymphoma subtypes, although associations were stronger for B-cell than for T-cell lymphomas. A history of skin cancer was associated with a doubling in risks of both non-Hodgkin and Hodgkin lymphoma. CONCLUSIONS: A history of high UV exposure was associated with reduced risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The positive association between skin cancer and malignant lymphomas is, therefore, unlikely to be mediated by UV exposure.","['Smedby, Karin Ekstrom', 'Hjalgrim, Henrik', 'Melbye, Mads', 'Torrang, Anna', 'Rostgaard, Klaus', 'Munksgaard, Lars', 'Adami, Johanna', 'Hansen, Mads', 'Porwit-MacDonald, Anna', 'Jensen, Bjarne Anker', 'Roos, Goran', 'Pedersen, Bjarne Bach', 'Sundstrom, Christer', 'Glimelius, Bengt', 'Adami, Hans-Olov']","['Smedby KE', 'Hjalgrim H', 'Melbye M', 'Torrang A', 'Rostgaard K', 'Munksgaard L', 'Adami J', 'Hansen M', 'Porwit-MacDonald A', 'Jensen BA', 'Roos G', 'Pedersen BB', 'Sundstrom C', 'Glimelius B', 'Adami HO']","['Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Karolinska Institutet, Box 281, SE-171 77 Stockholm, Sweden. karin.ekstrom@meb.ki.se']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Confounding Factors, Epidemiologic', 'Denmark/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Hodgkin Disease/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/epidemiology', 'Logistic Models', 'Lymphoma/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Odds Ratio', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Sweden/epidemiology', '*Ultraviolet Rays/adverse effects']",2005/02/03 09:00,2005/02/16 09:00,['2005/02/03 09:00'],"['2005/02/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/02/16 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['97/3/199 [pii]', '10.1093/jnci/dji022 [doi]']",ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 2005 Feb 2;97(3):199-209. doi: 10.1093/jnci/dji022.,,,,['5R01 CA69269-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,"['J Natl Cancer Inst. 2005 Feb 2;97(3):161-3.

In contrast, XIAP antagonist 1396-12 was not lethal to the normal hematopoietic cells in short-term cytotoxicity assays. Response of primary AML specimens to XIAP inhibitor correlated with XIAP protein levels, with higher levels of XIAP associated with sensitivity. The XIAP antagonist 1396-12 induced activation of downstream caspases 3 and 7 prior to the activation of upstream caspase 8 and caspase 9. Apoptosis induction was also independent of B-cell lymphoma protein-2 (Bcl-2) or caspase 8, indicative of a downstream effect on apoptotic pathways. Thus, polyphenylurea-based XIAP antagonsists directly induce apoptosis of leukemia cells and AML patient samples at low micromolar concentrations through a mechanism of action distinct from conventional chemotherapeutic agents.","['Carter, Bing Z', 'Gronda, Marcela', 'Wang, Zhiliang', 'Welsh, Kate', 'Pinilla, Clemencia', 'Andreeff, Michael', 'Schober, Wendy D', 'Nefzi, Adel', 'Pond, Gregory R', 'Mawji, Imtiaz A', 'Houghten, Richard A', 'Ostresh, John', 'Brandwein, Joseph', 'Minden, Mark D', 'Schuh, Andre C', 'Wells, Richard A', 'Messner, Hans', 'Chun, Kathy', 'Reed, John C', 'Schimmer, Aaron D']","['Carter BZ', 'Gronda M', 'Wang Z', 'Welsh K', 'Pinilla C', 'Andreeff M', 'Schober WD', 'Nefzi A', 'Pond GR', 'Mawji IA', 'Houghten RA', 'Ostresh J', 'Brandwein J', 'Minden MD', 'Schuh AC', 'Wells RA', 'Messner H', 'Chun K', 'Reed JC', 'Schimmer AD']","['University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",20050201,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Aniline Compounds)', '0', '(N-(6-((anilinocarbonyl)amino)-5-((anilinocarbonyl)((1-(4-cyclohexylbutyl)pyrroli', ""din-2-yl)methyl)amino)hexyl)-N-methyl-N'-phenylurea)"", '0 (Phenylurea Compounds)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein)', '0 (XIAP protein, human)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Aniline Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Phenylurea Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein']",2005/02/03 09:00,2005/06/09 09:00,['2005/02/03 09:00'],"['2005/02/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/09 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)45496-5 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2004-08-3168 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2005 May 15;105(10):4043-50. doi: 10.1182/blood-2004-08-3168.

Because subsequent immune reconstitution remains a major concern, we studied NK-cell recovery in 10 patients with AML who received haplomismatched SC transplants, among whom no GvL effect was observed, despite the mismatched immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) ligand in the GvH direction for 8 of 10 patients. NK cells generated after SCT exhibited an immature phenotype: the cytotoxic CD3- CD56(dim) subset was small, expression of KIRs and NKp30 was reduced, while CD94/NKG2A expression was increased. This phenotype was associated to in vitro lower levels of cytotoxicity against a K562 cell line and against primary mismatched AML blasts than donor samples. This impaired lysis was correlated with CD94/NKG2A expression in NK cells. Blockading CD94/NKG2A restored lysis against the AML blasts, which all expressed HLA-E, the ligand for CD94/NKG2A. Our present study allows a better understanding of the NK-cell differentiation after SCT. These results revealed that the NK cells generated after haplomismatched SCT are blocked at an immature state characterized by specific phenotypic features and impaired functioning, having potential impact for immune responsiveness and transplantation outcome.","['Nguyen, Stephanie', 'Dhedin, Nathalie', 'Vernant, Jean-Paul', 'Kuentz, Mathieu', 'Al Jijakli, Ahmad', 'Rouas-Freiss, Nathalie', 'Carosella, Edgardo D', 'Boudifa, Ali', 'Debre, Patrice', 'Vieillard, Vincent']","['Nguyen S', 'Dhedin N', 'Vernant JP', 'Kuentz M', 'Al Jijakli A', 'Rouas-Freiss N', 'Carosella ED', 'Boudifa A', 'Debre P', 'Vieillard V']","[""Laboratoire d'Immunologie Cellulaire et Tissulaire INSERM U543, Hopital Pitie-Salpetriere, 83 Bvd de l'Hopital 75013 Paris, France. stephanienguyenquoc@hotmail.com""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20050201,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (CD56 Antigen)', '0 (KLRC1 protein, human)', '0 (NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily C)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Natural Killer Cell)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'CD56 Antigen/immunology', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Female', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/*immunology', 'Haploidy', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*cytology/*physiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology/metabolism/pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily C', 'Phenotype', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*immunology/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Natural Killer Cell', 'Treatment Outcome']",2005/02/03 09:00,2005/06/09 09:00,['2005/02/03 09:00'],"['2005/02/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/09 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)45508-9 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2004-10-4113 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2005 May 15;105(10):4135-42. doi: 10.1182/blood-2004-10-4113.

Because of their important role in pathogenesis, rare and biologically distinct leukemia stem cells (LSCs) represent a critical target for therapeutic intervention. However, to date, very few agents have been shown to directly target the LSC population. The present studies demonstrate that parthenolide (PTL), a naturally occurring small molecule, induces robust apoptosis in primary human AML cells and blast crisis CML (bcCML) cells while sparing normal hematopoietic cells. Furthermore, analysis of progenitor cells using in vitro colony assays, as well as stem cells using the nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient (NOD/SCID) xenograft model, show that PTL also preferentially targets AML progenitor and stem cell populations. Notably, in comparison to the standard chemotherapy drug cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C), PTL is much more specific to leukemia cells. The molecular mechanism of PTL-mediated apoptosis is strongly associated with inhibition of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB), proapoptotic activation of p53, and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS). On the basis of these findings, we propose that the activity of PTL triggers LSC-specific apoptosis and as such represents a potentially important new class of drugs for LSC-targeted therapy.","['Guzman, Monica L', 'Rossi, Randall M', 'Karnischky, Lilliana', 'Li, Xiaojie', 'Peterson, Derick R', 'Howard, Dianna S', 'Jordan, Craig T']","['Guzman ML', 'Rossi RM', 'Karnischky L', 'Li X', 'Peterson DR', 'Howard DS', 'Jordan CT']","['University of Rochester School of Medicine, 601 Elmwood Ave, Box 703, Rochester, NY 14642, USA. monica_guzman@urmc.rochester.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",20050201,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Lactones)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Sesquiterpenes)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '2RDB26I5ZB (parthenolide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Blast Crisis/drug therapy/pathology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Humans', 'Lactones/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'NF-kappa B/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Sesquiterpenes/*pharmacology', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism']",2005/02/03 09:00,2005/07/13 09:00,['2005/02/03 09:00'],"['2005/02/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)53450-2 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2004-10-4135 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2005 Jun 1;105(11):4163-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2004-10-4135.

Because of its superior specificity, sensitivity, and precision, high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was selected as the reference method with which the other two procedures were compared using approximately 420 different plasma samples for method comparison. 7-Hydroxymethotrexate (7-OHMTX), the major plasma metabolite of MTX, that can be detected in plasma at relatively high concentrations for long periods following infusion of a high dose of MTX, was also quantitated by HPLC. Forty-two and 66 h after infusion, the plasma level of MTX was overestimated in 2% and 3% of the samples by the FPIA2 procedure in 5% and 31% by the EMIT assay. The overall correlation coefficients (r2) for the values obtained by FPIA2 or EMIT versus those based on HPLC were 0.989 and 0.663, respectively. The presence of 7-OHMTX exerted a highly significant influence (p=0.0007 as determined by the unpaired t-test) on MTX measurement by the EMIT assay. We conclude that the rapid automated procedures routinely used at present and in particular EMIT, suffer from cross-reactivity with metabolites of MTX. Thus, the relatively high percentage of samples in which the level of MTX is overestimated at check-points by EMIT may result in longer periods of hospitalization, higher costs and prolonged administration of elevated doses of ""rescue"" leucovorin with an increased risk for relapse.","['Fotoohi, Kambiz', 'Skarby, Tor', 'Soderhall, Stefan', 'Peterson, Curt', 'Albertioni, Freidoun']","['Fotoohi K', 'Skarby T', 'Soderhall S', 'Peterson C', 'Albertioni F']","['Department of Oncology and Pathology, Cancer Center Karolinska (CCK), Karolinska University Hospital, S-17176 Stockholm, Sweden. kambiz.fotoohi@onkpat.ki.se']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,J Chromatogr B Analyt Technol Biomed Life Sci,"Journal of chromatography.

The immunosuppressive properties of this cytokine are partly attributed to its capacity to render dendritic cells (DCs) unable to undergo full maturation and to activate T cells. We reported here that myeloid DCs retrovirally transduced with vIL-10 had an impaired production of IL-12 and a decreased expression of MHC class II molecules but had minor defects in costimulatory molecule expression and no alteration on CCR5 and CCR7 expression. In mixed leukocyte reaction, vIL-10-transduced C57BL/6 bm12 (MHC class II mismatch) DCs had a reduced capacity to stimulate C57BL/6 wild-type CD4+ T-cell proliferation. We show that bm12 vIL-10-transduced DC administration in CD8-/- C57BL/6 mice promoted IFN-gamma production, down-regulated TH2-type cytokine production, and did not induce skin graft tolerance.

In generating 'one-bead one-compound' (OBOC) combinatorial libraries, novel encoding methods have been applied to these beads such as the testing library compound and the coding tags residing on the outer layer and inner core of each bead, respectively. In this report, we further exploit these bilayer beads by preparing target bead-libraries with low concentration of random peptides on the outer layer, and full substitution of coding peptides in the bead interior. The low concentration of peptide on the bead surface enables us to greatly increase the stringency of screening so that higher affinity ligands can easily be identified. Full substitution of the inner core of the beads enables us to have enough coding peptides inside the bead for direct microsequencing with Edman chemistry. The biphasic approach of preparing bilayer beads can be carried out at any point during the library construction. Therefore, the nonsequencable or fixed structures of the peptides can be bypassed in the coding tags. As a result, peptide libraries that otherwise cannot be sequenced can now be sequenced, and peptide segments with fixed residues within the libraries can be bypassed so that the microsequencing time can be significantly shortened. Furthermore, peptides with a branch of random sequence in the middle of a fixed peptide chain can be encoded with just the random sequence in the bead interior. We have successfully applied these novel OBOC library concepts in the optimization of cell-surface ligands for a human T-cell leukemia, Jurkat, cell line.","['Wang, X', 'Peng, L', 'Liu, R', 'Xu, B', 'Lam, K S']","['Wang X', 'Peng L', 'Liu R', 'Xu B', 'Lam KS']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, UC Davis Cancer Center, University of California Davis, 4501 X Street, Sacramento, Davis, CA 95817, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,Denmark,J Pept Res,The journal of peptide research : official journal of the American Peptide Society,9707067,"['0 (Ligands)', '0 (Peptide Library)', '6SO6U10H04 (Biotin)', '9013-20-1 (Streptavidin)', 'EC 3.1.3.1 (Alkaline Phosphatase)']",IM,"['Alkaline Phosphatase/metabolism', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Biotin', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Ligands', '*Microspheres', '*Peptide Library', 'Protein Binding', 'Streptavidin/metabolism']",2005/02/03 09:00,2005/07/27 09:00,['2005/02/03 09:00'],"['2005/02/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/27 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['JPP192 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1399-3011.2005.00192.x [doi]']",ppublish,J Pept Res. 2005 Jan;65(1):130-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1399-3011.2005.00192.x.,,,,"['R33CA-86364/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R33CA-99136/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cytopenias occurred in all five 'mismatch' patients but not in two patients with 'match', suggesting that KIR/HLA-I mismatch may contribute to the suppression of haematopoiesis.","['Nowakowski, Grzegorz S', 'Morice, William G', 'Phyliky, Robert L', 'Li, Chin-Yang', 'Tefferi, Ayalew']","['Nowakowski GS', 'Morice WG', 'Phyliky RL', 'Li CY', 'Tefferi A']","['Department of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, KIR)', '0 (Receptors, KIR2DL1)', '0 (Receptors, KIR2DL3)', '0 (Receptors, KIR3DL1)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/*blood', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*immunology', 'Leukopenia/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*blood', 'Receptors, KIR', 'Receptors, KIR2DL1', 'Receptors, KIR2DL3', 'Receptors, KIR3DL1']",2005/02/03 09:00,2005/03/23 09:00,['2005/02/03 09:00'],"['2005/02/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/23 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['BJH5341 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2004.05341.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2005 Feb;128(4):490-2. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2004.05341.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since clinical outcomes in CLL are very heterogeneous, it is of utmost importance to correctly assess the disease prognosis in each individual case. Recently, it has been shown that high ZAP-70 [Zeta-chain (T-cell receptor) associated protein kinase (70 kDa)] expression level strongly correlates with lack of IgV(H) mutations and poor prognosis in B-CLL. As CLL malignant cells are arrested in G(0), we investigated whether Dipeptidyl Peptidase 2 (DPP2), a serine protease that plays a key role in keeping cells in the quiescent state, is involved in cell-cycle control in CLL. We have previously shown that specific inhibition of DPP2 results in apoptosis of normal lymphocytes. In this study, cell apoptosis experiments were conducted in 38 patients with B-CLL. Two distinct subsets of B-CLL were identified, susceptible and resistant to DPP2-inhibition-induced apoptosis. If resistant to apoptosis (42.1%), the CLL cells have higher expression of ZAP-70 and exhibit a worse prognosis, such as shorter treatment-free time period. Thus, resistance vs. susceptibility to DPP2-inhibiton induced apoptosis can be employed as a novel prognostic factor in CLL.","['Danilov, Alexey V', 'Klein, Andreas K', 'Lee, Henry J', 'Baez, Diana Velez', 'Huber, Brigitte T']","['Danilov AV', 'Klein AK', 'Lee HJ', 'Baez DV', 'Huber BT']","['Department of Pathology, Tufts University School of Medicine, Boston, MA 02111, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Boronic Acids)', '0 (Dipeptides)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (PT-100 dipeptide)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP70 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (CD38 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)', 'EC 3.4.14.- (Dipeptidyl-Peptidases and Tripeptidyl-Peptidases)', 'EC 3.4.14.2 (dipeptidyl peptidase II)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase/metabolism', 'ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/metabolism', 'Boronic Acids/pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Dipeptides/pharmacology', 'Dipeptidyl-Peptidases and Tripeptidyl-Peptidases/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/enzymology/metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', '*Resting Phase, Cell Cycle', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase']",2005/02/03 09:00,2005/03/23 09:00,['2005/02/03 09:00'],"['2005/02/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/23 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['BJH5346 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2004.05346.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2005 Feb;128(4):472-81. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2004.05346.x.,,,,"['R01 AI043469/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'M01-RR0054/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI 43469/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Expression of 205 cell signalling and apoptosis genes were compared by cDNA array among cases with different chromosome abnormalities. A majority of the statistically differentially expressed genes were present in the 11q23 deletion group by hierarchical clustering. CDC2, a serine/threonine kinase, was overexpressed in the 11q23 deletion group (P = 0.0004) and confirmed by Taqman real-time polymerase chain reaction. Several other genes associated with cell signalling were overexpressed in the 11q23 deletion group. A strong overall correlation existed between the presence of different chromosome abnormalities and a number of prognostic factors including immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region mutation status (P = 0.011), time to treatment (P = 0.025) and lymphocyte doubling time (P = 0.034). This study confirmed the prognostic impact of chromosome abnormalities identified by FISH in CLL, particularly the 11q23 deletion and trisomy 12.

However, treatment results of some neoplastic diseases in children, including chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) still remain unsatisfactory. The only chance of cure remains allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, however availability of transplantation is still low as a limited number of donors is available. In neoplastic diseases in which treatment results remain poor, intensification of treatment components (chemotherapy, radiotherapy) did not succeed in improving the treatment results. In recent years no improvement was made in gene therapy. With introduction of new drugs that selectively inhibit mechanisms of maturation and proliferation of cancer cells, new hope has arisen. In our paper we present the mechanism of action of imatinib, the tyrosine kinase inhibitor which was employed in the treatment of CML and gastrointestinal stromal tumors.

The retrospective analysis included 229 patients with ALL divided into three groups depending on the type of anti-HBV prophylaxis. The group 1 (1990-91, 38 patients) received only sporadically passive prophylaxis, in the group 2 (1992-94, 55 patients) passive prophylaxis was regular, and the patients of the group 3 (1995-2001, 138 children) received complete active and passive prophylaxis. Among vaccinated children three subgroups were additionally distinguished: subgroup a--vaccination was completed before the disease, subgroup b--the cycle of vaccination began before and continued during the therapy, subgroup c--the whole cycle of vaccination was performed during the ALL treatment. The efficacy of the prophylaxis was evaluated taking into account the incidence of hepatitis B and the level of anti-HBs antibodies in vaccinated children. Additionally the incidence of hepatitis C was assessed to evaluate the role of unspecific prophylaxis. The incidence of hepatitis B in the group 1, 2, and 3 was: 57.9%, 23.6%, and 0.76%, respectively, and the incidence of hepatitis C: 44.7%, 36.4%, and 5.9%, respectively. The percent of the failure of active prophylaxis in the subgroup a, b, and c was: 29%, 53%, and 93%, respectively. In spite of the reduction of exposure to the infection (unspecific prophylaxis), the role of specific prophylaxis is essential.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: 56 children, with de novo diagnosed ALL, comprised test group. Control group consisted of 10 healthy persons. DNA was isolated from peripheral blood and bone marrow. During research applied was the PCR method with the use of starters specific for conservative IgH and TCR delta gene fragments. ALL therapy was monitored by evaluation of MRD in the 15th and 33rd day of treatment and prior to supportive treatment. Stratification into risk groups, based on the MRD test results was compared with the stratification conducted in accordance with the recognised prognostic factors, such as: primary leucocytosis, steroid therapy response, drug resistance and karyotype. RESULTS: Among 52 children (92.8%) of the 56, which were tested prior to the start of treatment, obtained the sought for rearrangement, 90-120bp size stripe being an amplified regrouping of the VDJ fragment. Among all the tested healthy persons, the test result was negative. Testing the IgH and TCR delta gene regrouping allowed to demonstrate clonality of the neoplastic process during the diagnosis in 92.8% of the cases. In some of them the regrouping had a bi- or oligoclonal character. The number of patients with a positive MRD test result was dependent on the phase of treatment. Positive results were recorded among 10% of the patients (4/39) during clinical remission, among 86% (6/7) deceased and among 80% (4/5) suffering from relapse. Among 16.7% (2/13) of the patients with determined relapse or who died due to the course of illness process were also observed negative MRD test results. Steroid resistance was stated among 18/56 children, out of which 8/56 obtained a positive MRD test result in the 33rd day of treatment. Among 3 of them the result was maintained prior to supportive treatment. Leucocytosis during diagnosis above 50 thousand was recorded among 10/56 patients. Among 5 of them determined was rearrangement on the 33rd day of treatment, and for 1 prior to supportive treatment. Cytogenetic tests showed a correct karyotype for 19 out of 56 tested children. In this group steroid resistance was determined among 8 children, high preliminary leucocytosis among 5 and in 17 cases of the tested rearrangement. Stratification into therapeutic groups based on classical prognostic factors in most cases was the same with the stratification based on the MRD test results. The accuracy of the latter method was greater. CONCLUSIONS: The use of MRD test has its application in risk group qualification. MRD test is helpful in determining relapses prior to the appearance of clinical symptoms. Among the tested group of children with ALL a positive MRD test result was a bad prognostic factor. It seams that the use of a combined analysis of the risk factors and the MRD test results in a significant manner contribute to a more complex evaluation of the patient's condition.","['Raciborska, Anna', 'Wypych, Agnieszka', 'Rokicka-Milewska, Roma', 'Siedlecki, Janusz A', 'Kulik, Jadwiga']","['Raciborska A', 'Wypych A', 'Rokicka-Milewska R', 'Siedlecki JA', 'Kulik J']","['Klinika Chirurgii Onkologicznej Dzieci, Instytu Matki i Dziecka w Warszawie. anna.raciborska@hoga.pl']",['pol'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,Poland,Przegl Lek,Przeglad lekarski,19840720R,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', '*Genes, Immunoglobulin', '*Genes, T-Cell Receptor delta', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Neoplasm, Residual/drug therapy/genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",2005/02/03 09:00,2005/04/14 09:00,['2005/02/03 09:00'],"['2005/02/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/14 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/03 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Przegl Lek. 2004;61 Suppl 2:62-6.,,,Wstepne wyniki wykorzystania testu MRD u dzieci z ostra bialaczka limfoblastyczna.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The pts with NHL T have been treated according to BFM-90 protocol. The predominant primary site of disease was mediastinum (59.3%). Complete remission (CR) was achieved by 87%. EFS for all NHL T pts was 65% and 56% for pts with extensive tumours and 73% for pts with tumours < 10 cm. Patients with NHL B were treated according to the adopted LMB-89 protocol. The majority were Burkitts type and presented abdominal location (50%). 80% with disseminated disease. CR was achieved by 89% patients, but 94% with LDH < 500 IU/L and 73% with LDH > 500 IU.

In years 1997-2001, in 10 centers of PPLLSG, 280 patients (age 2.3-18.8 years) were treated for HD. In all patients MVPP and B-DOPA chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy was introduced. Among 280 treated children the first remission was achieved in 275 patients (98.2%). Relapses occurred in 11 patients (4%). The 5-year probability of overall survival, relapse-free survival (RFS) and event-free survival (EFS) was 99%, 93% and 90%, respectively.

Systemic metastatic disease is present in 50% of patients at diagnosis. In the remaining 50% presenting with local regional disease, systemic metastatic disease will develop in the vast majority of these patients. The limited efficacy and toxicity of conventional fluorouracil (5-FU)/cisplatin-based chemotherapy has prompted the evaluation of newer agents. Irinotecan (Camptosar) has shown promising single-agent activity in a number of gastrointestinal cancers, including colorectal, pancreatic, and esophagogastric cancer. The phase II evaluation of the combination of weekly irinotecan and cisplatin has shown encouraging response rates exceeding 30% to 50% in esophageal and gastric cancer. Hematologic toxicity using a schedule of 4 consecutive weeks of therapy followed by 2 weeks of rest prompted interest in a multicenter trial evaluation of a change in therapy delivery to 2 weeks on and 1 week off. Cisplatin at 30 mg/m2 was administered with irinotecan at 65 mg/m2, days 1 and 8, on an every-21-day schedule. Thirty-nine patients were entered on study, with 36 evaluable for toxicity and 31 evaluable for response. Grade 3/4 neutropenia was observed in only 22% of patients, reduced from 49% in a prior phase II trial employing 4 consecutive weeks of therapy. Confirmed major responses were observed in 36% of patients (10 of 28). A change to a day 1, day 8 schedule of weekly irinotecan and cisplatin appears to reduce hematologic toxicity but maintain antitumor activity in patients with esophageal and gastroesophageal junction cancer. A randomized phase II trial in gastric and esophageal cancer comparing weekly irinotecan and cisplatin to epirubicin, cisplatin, and 5-FU, and to infusional 5-FU in combination with irinotecan, will be conducted by the Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB).

In the Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) 9344 trial, addition of paclitaxel to anthracycline/cyclophosphamide adjuvant therapy resulted in increased time to recurrence and improved survival. Because an unplanned subgroup analysis in CALGB 9344 indicated a significant benefit of paclitaxel in patients with estrogen receptor (ER)-negative disease but not ER-positive disease, the initial tAnGo trial design called for enrollment of patients with ER-negative disease. The tAnGo trial entry criteria were recently amended to allow any ER status, given experience suggesting that clinical benefit of taxane-containing regimens in ER-positive disease may emerge over a time frame longer than that required to detect benefit in ER-negative disease. Gemcitabine has been included as a partner for paclitaxel in the tAnGo trial based on high response rates, including high complete response rates, observed in phase II trials of the combination in more advanced disease and based on the tolerability and safety of the combination compared with those of other taxane-containing two-drug combinations. The tAnGo trial is currently accruing patients and has a target population of 3,000.

Resulting blastocysts were subsequently plated intact on mouse feeder cells in a medium with or without LIF. Significantly more embryos reached the hatched blastocyst stage, and the number of blastocysts with excellent morphology was significantly higher, when LIF was omitted. At Day 8 p.i., total cell count (TCC) and inner cell mass (ICM) cell count was significantly higher in embryos cultured without LIF. In embryos cultured with LIF, cytoplasmic vesicles and lipid droplets were abundant and a decreased expression of both Oct4 and laminin could be observed. Initial hypoblast formation was revealed in almost 1/3 of the LIF-cultured blastocysts whereas this feature was evident in 2/3 of the blastocysts cultured in the absence of LIF. Overall, almost 60% of the blastocysts cultured without LIF formed outgrowth colonies (OCs) when plated on feeders, whereas this phenomenon was only observed in 30% of the blastocysts cultured in the presence of LIF. A tendency for retaining a tightly packed central growth of putative ICM-derived cells was observed, when attachment to the feeder layer was initiated close to the embryonic pole of the blastocyst. At Day 8 of outgrowth culture, approximately 20% of the colonies contained a central core of putative ICM-derived cells appearing large enough for mechanical isolation and further subculture. Immunohistochemical labeling for Oct4 revealed staining of both trophectodermal and ICM-derived cells. The presence of LIF in the outgrowth culture medium did not have any apparent effect on the plating efficiency or colony type. In conclusion, LIF had an adverse effect on in vitro embryonic development when added to the culture medium in the period from Days 5 to 8 p.i., whereas it had no apparent effect on the OCs subsequently formed from such embryos.","['Vejlsted, Morten', 'Avery, Birthe', 'Gjorret, Jakob Oemar', 'Maddox-Hyttel, Poul']","['Vejlsted M', 'Avery B', 'Gjorret JO', 'Maddox-Hyttel P']","['Department of Animal and Veterinary Basic Sciences, Anatomy and Cell Biology, Royal Veterinary and Agricultural University, Frederiksberg C, Denmark. mov@kvl.dk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Mol Reprod Dev,Molecular reproduction and development,8903333,"['0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cattle', 'Embryo, Mammalian/*drug effects', '*Fertilization in Vitro', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Interleukin-6/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor']",2005/02/03 09:00,2005/07/16 09:00,['2005/02/03 09:00'],"['2005/02/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/16 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/03 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/mrd.20221 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Reprod Dev. 2005 Apr;70(4):445-54. doi: 10.1002/mrd.20221.,,,,,,,,,"['2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,

The results showed that the expressions of Fas, Fas ligand (FasL), Bcl-2, and Bax were co-localized predominantly in the epithelial cells of the endometrium. Modest Fas staining with no obvious change was detected throughout the menstrual cycle, while the levels of FasL and Bax protein in the epithelial cells increased in the secretory phase when apoptosis was most prevalent. In contrast, epithelial immunostaining for Bcl-2 was maximal during the proliferative phase and decreased in the secretory phase. Bcl-2 immunoreactivity was also detected in some immunocytes.

Flow cytometry was performed in all CLL cases (n = 52). IgV(H) mutational status was determined in 25 CLL and 12 mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) patients. ZAP-70 was positive in 34/52 (65%) CLL, 9/31 (31%) Burkitt's lymphoma, 2/7 (29%) lymphoblastic lymphomas, 3/36 (8%) MCL, 1/23 (4%) marginal zone lymphoma, and 1/45 (2%) diffuse large B-cell lymphomas, but in none of the 19 follicular lymphomas or the 14 Hodgkin lymphomas. An identical ZAP-70 pattern was obtained in six patients with simultaneous biopsies from different sites and in 12 patients with sequential biopsies.

All but one ZAP-70-positive CLL had IgV(H) gene in an unmutated configuration, whereas all but one ZAP-70-negative CLL had somatically hypermutated IgV(H). The 12 MCLs analysed were ZAP-70 negative regardless of IgV(H) mutational status (4 mutated, 8 unmutated).

The most frequent (65%) and most malignant histological type is the glioblastoma. Since the introduction of computerized tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, the incidence rates of brain tumors have been rather stable, with a tendency of higher rates in highly developed, industrialized countries. Some reports indicate that Caucasians have higher incidence than black or Asian populations, but to some extent, this may reflect socio-economic differences and under-ascertainment in some regions, rather than a significant difference in genetic susceptibility. With the exception of pilocytic astrocytomas, the prognosis of glioma patients is still poor. Less than 3% of glioblastoma patients are still alive at 5 years after diagnosis, higher age being the most significant predictor of poor outcome. Brain tumors are a component of several inherited tumor syndromes, but the prevalence of these syndromes is very low. Several occupations, environmental carcinogens, and diet (N-nitroso compounds) have been reported to be associated with an elevated glioma risk, but the only environmental factor unequivocally associated with an increased risk of brain tumors, including gliomas, is therapeutic X-irradiation. In particular, children treated with X-irradiation for acute lymphoblastic leukemia show a significantly elevated risk of developing gliomas and primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET), often within 10 years after therapy. TP53 mutations are frequent in low-grade gliomas and secondary glioblastomas derived therefrom. Approximately 60% of mutations are located in the hot spot codons 248 and 273, and the majority of these are G:C-->A:T transitions at CpG sites. TP53 mutations are significantly more frequent in low-grade astrocytomas with promoter methylation of the O(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase repair gene, suggesting that, in addition to deamination of 5-methylcytosine, exogenous or endogenous alkylation in the O(6) position of guanine may contribute to the formation of these mutations.","['Ohgaki, Hiroko', 'Kleihues, Paul']","['Ohgaki H', 'Kleihues P']","['International Agency for Research on Cancer, Lyon, France. ohgaki@iarc.fr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20050201,Germany,Acta Neuropathol,Acta neuropathologica,0412041,['0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)'],IM,"['Age Factors', 'Central Nervous System Viral Diseases/complications', 'Craniocerebral Trauma/complications', 'Educational Status', 'Electromagnetic Fields/adverse effects', 'Glioma/*epidemiology/*etiology/genetics/mortality', 'Humans', 'Hypersensitivity/complications', 'Incidence', 'Models, Biological', 'Mortality', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Occupational Exposure', 'Radiation, Ionizing', '*Risk Factors', 'Sex Factors', 'Smoking/adverse effects', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics']",2005/02/03 09:00,2005/06/18 09:00,['2005/02/03 09:00'],"['2004/10/27 00:00 [received]', '2004/11/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/02/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/18 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/03 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00401-005-0991-y [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Neuropathol. 2005 Jan;109(1):93-108. doi: 10.1007/s00401-005-0991-y.

Loss of Testisin has been implicated in testicular tumorigenesis, but its role in testis biology and tumorigenesis is not known. Here we have investigated the role of CpG methylation in Testisin gene inactivation and tested the hypothesis that Testisin may act as a tumour suppressor for testicular tumorigenesis. Using sequence analysis of bisulphite-treated genomic DNA, we find a strong relationship between hypermethylation of a 385 bp 5' CpG rich island of the Testisin gene, and silencing of the Testisin gene in a range of human tumour cell lines and in 100% (eight/eight) of testicular germ cell tumours. We show that treatment of Testisin-negative cell lines with demethylating agents and/or a histone deacetylase inhibitor results in reactivation of Testisin gene expression, implicating hypermethylation in Testisin gene silencing. Stable expression of Testisin in the Testisin-negative Tera-2 testicular cancer line suppressed tumorigenicity as revealed by inhibition of both anchorage-dependent cell growth and tumour formation in an SCID mouse model of testicular tumorigenesis. Together, these data show that loss of Testisin is caused, at least in part, by DNA hypermethylation and histone deacetylation, and suggest a tumour suppressor role for Testisin in testicular tumorigenesis.","['Manton, K J', 'Douglas, M L', 'Netzel-Arnett, S', 'Fitzpatrick, D R', 'Nicol, D L', 'Boyd, A W', 'Clements, J A', 'Antalis, T M']","['Manton KJ', 'Douglas ML', 'Netzel-Arnett S', 'Fitzpatrick DR', 'Nicol DL', 'Boyd AW', 'Clements JA', 'Antalis TM']","['Leukaemia Foundation and Cellular Oncology Laboratories, Queensland Institute of Medical Research, Queensland, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (GPI-Linked Proteins)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (PRSS21 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Serine Endopeptidases)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*CpG Islands', '*DNA Methylation', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*metabolism', 'GPI-Linked Proteins', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', '*Gene Silencing', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Male', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Orchiectomy', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Serine Endopeptidases/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Testicular Neoplasms/genetics/*metabolism/surgery', 'Transplantation, Heterologous']",2005/02/03 09:00,2005/03/25 09:00,['2005/02/03 09:00'],"['2005/02/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/25 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['6602373 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.bjc.6602373 [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 2005 Feb 28;92(4):760-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.bjc.6602373.,,,,,PMC2361880,['Br J Cancer. 2015 Dec 1;113(11):1640.

Between August 6, 1993, and January 15, 1999, 319 patients with LSSCLC were accrued to CALGB 9235. Patients were randomized to receive chemotherapy with or without high-dose TAM. Treatment on the non-TAM containing arm (arm 1) included DDP (80 mg/m2 intravenously day 1 only) and VP-16 (80 mg/m2 intravenously days 1-3) given every 3 weeks for a total of 5 cycles. Patients treated on arm 2 received the identical chemotherapy regimen as described here with the addition of high-dose TAM (80 mg orally twice per day), which was given for 5 days each cycle starting 1 day before the DDP. Thoracic radiation (XRT) given at 200 cGy 5 days per week to a total dose of 50 Gy began on day 1 of cycle 4 of chemotherapy and overlapped with cycle 5. Prophylactic cranial irradiation was offered to all patients who achieved a complete response or near-complete response. A total of 307 patients are evaluable for response. After the completion of the chemoradiation portion of the treatment, the overall response rate (ORR) was 88% for 154 patients treated without tamoxifen and 84% for 153 patients treated with tamoxifen with complete response (CR) rates of 49% and 50%, respectively. The median failure-free survivals of 12.3 months and 10.5 months and the overall survivals of 20.6 months and 18.4 months, respectively, were not statistically significant between the 2 arms. Toxicity was similar with and without tamoxifen. This phase III trial failed to demonstrate a positive effect on either the response or survival for the addition of TAM to standard etoposide-cisplatin-radiation management for patients with LS-SCLC. However, these data continue to support a positive effect of chemoradiation in the treatment of patients with LS-SCLC.","['McClay, Edward F', 'Bogart, Jeff', 'Herndon, James E 2nd', 'Watson, Dee', 'Evans, Lisa', 'Seagren, Steven L', 'Green, Mark R']","['McClay EF', 'Bogart J', 'Herndon JE 2nd', 'Watson D', 'Evans L', 'Seagren SL', 'Green MR']","['San Diego Melanoma Research Center, Vista, California 92083, USA. emcclay@sdcri.org']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase III', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",,United States,Am J Clin Oncol,American journal of clinical oncology,8207754,"['094ZI81Y45 (Tamoxifen)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Brain Neoplasms/prevention & control/secondary', 'Carcinoma, Small Cell/*drug therapy/pathology/radiotherapy', 'Chemotherapy, Adjuvant', 'Cisplatin/administration & dosage', 'Cranial Irradiation', 'Dose Fractionation, Radiation', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology/radiotherapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary', 'Survival Analysis', 'Tamoxifen/administration & dosage']",2005/02/03 09:00,2005/08/09 09:00,['2005/02/03 09:00'],"['2005/02/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/09 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['00000421-200502000-00015 [pii]', '10.1097/01.coc.0000139940.52625.d0 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Clin Oncol. 2005 Feb;28(1):81-90. doi: 10.1097/01.coc.0000139940.52625.d0.,,,,,,,,,,['Cancer and Leukemia Group B Study (9235)'],,,,,,,

We previously demonstrated that human leukemic cells lack these receptors and are therefore resistant to Ad5 transduction, limiting efforts to genetically modify these cells. Human leukemic blasts are, however, susceptible to transduction with an adenovector made CAR independent by substitution of a chimeric Ad5/35 fiber [Yotnda et al. (2001). Gene Ther. 8, 930-937]. Other receptors can also be targeted with recombinant ligand moieties incorporated into adenovirus fiber. We have determined which of these fiber-modified adenovectors is most effective at modifying human primary leukemia cells, and lines. We used a replication-incompetent Ad5-beta-gal vector, in which the Ad5 fiber was replaced with fiber from various adenovirus serotypes (Ad35 and Ad11), or modified either with variable length polylysine (K4, K7, K21) or RGD-4C peptide. All the modified fiber vectors transduced primary leukemia cells and cell lines more efficiently than Ad5. Polylysine-substituted Ad5F/K21 and peptide-modified Ad5F/RGD vectors were most effective overall (up to 100% efficiency), whereas Ad5F/RGD was the most effective at transducing B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells (90% efficiency). Ad5F/K21 and Ad5F/RGD should be of value for the genetic modification of human primary leukemia cells.","['Yotnda, P', 'Zompeta, C', 'Heslop, H E', 'Andreeff, M', 'Brenner, M K', 'Marini, F']","['Yotnda P', 'Zompeta C', 'Heslop HE', 'Andreeff M', 'Brenner MK', 'Marini F']","[""Center for Cell and Gene Therapy, Baylor College of Medicine, Methodist Hospital, and Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, TX 77030, USA. pyotnda@bcm.tmc.edu""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Hum Gene Ther,Human gene therapy,9008950,"['0 (Integrins)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '25104-18-1 (Polylysine)', 'EC 3.2.1.23 (beta-Galactosidase)']",IM,"['Adenoviridae/*genetics', 'Adenoviruses, Human/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', '*Genetic Vectors', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Integrins/metabolism', 'Jurkat Cells', 'K562 Cells', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Models, Biological', 'Oligopeptides/genetics', 'Polylysine/genetics', 'Serotyping', 'Time Factors', 'Transduction, Genetic/*methods', 'beta-Galactosidase/metabolism']",2005/02/03 09:00,2005/04/22 09:00,['2005/02/03 09:00'],"['2005/02/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/22 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/03 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/hum.2004.15.1229 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Gene Ther. 2004 Dec;15(12):1229-42. doi: 10.1089/hum.2004.15.1229.,,,,"['P01 CA094237/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1R03DK067264-01/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA94237/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Concomitant with the inhibition of gene expression and defects in the DNA repair pathways, increased sensitivity of T lymphocytes to various genotoxic stresses that challenged all major DNA repair pathways were detected.

To identify genetic variations that influence this process, we conducted a large-scale association study using a collection of German cases and controls and >25,000 SNPs located within 16,000 genes. One of the loci identified was located on chromosome 11q13 [odds ratio (OR)=1.85, P=0.017]. The initial association was subsequently tested in two independent breast cancer collections. In both sample sets, the frequency of the susceptibility allele was increased in the cases (OR=1.6, P=0.01). The susceptibility allele was also associated with an increase in cancer family history (P=0.1). Fine mapping showed that the region of association extends approximately 300 kb and spans several genes, including the gene encoding the nuclear mitotic apparatus protein (NuMA). A nonsynonymous SNP (A794G) in NuMA was identified that showed a stronger association with breast cancer risk than the initial marker SNP (OR=2.8, P=0.005 initial sample; OR=2.1, P=0.002 combined). NuMA is a cell cycle-related protein essential for normal mitosis that is degraded in early apoptosis. NuMA-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion proteins have been described in acute promyelocytic leukemia. Although the potential functional relevance of the A794G variation requires further biological validation, we conclude that variations in the NuMA gene are likely responsible for the observed increased breast cancer risk.","['Kammerer, Stefan', 'Roth, Richard B', 'Hoyal, Carolyn R', 'Reneland, Richard', 'Marnellos, George', 'Kiechle, Marion', 'Schwarz-Boeger, Ulrike', 'Griffiths, Lyn R', 'Ebner, Florian', 'Rehbock, Joachim', 'Cantor, Charles R', 'Nelson, Matthew R', 'Braun, Andreas']","['Kammerer S', 'Roth RB', 'Hoyal CR', 'Reneland R', 'Marnellos G', 'Kiechle M', 'Schwarz-Boeger U', 'Griffiths LR', 'Ebner F', 'Rehbock J', 'Cantor CR', 'Nelson MR', 'Braun A']","['Sequenom, Inc., San Diego, CA 92121, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20050131,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Antigens, Nuclear)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Genetic Markers)', '0 (NUMA1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Matrix-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, Nuclear', 'Breast Neoplasms/*genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', 'Disease Susceptibility', 'Female', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Middle Aged', 'Nuclear Matrix-Associated Proteins', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Risk Factors', 'Statistics as Topic']",2005/02/03 09:00,2005/04/23 09:00,['2005/02/03 09:00'],"['2005/02/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/23 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['0409806102 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.0409806102 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2005 Feb 8;102(6):2004-9. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0409806102.

Goldfish LIFR shares a 26% amino acid sequence identity with mammalian LIFR sequences; however it retains all of the conserved amino acid motifs that identify a functional LIFR such as the cytokine binding domains and the box-1 and box-2 motifs. The goldfish LIFR phylogenetically groups with the other identified LIFRs from human, mouse, rat and chicken, and it appears to be ancestral to the divergence of the oncostatin M receptor (OSMR).

Gp130 contains a crucial motif around tyrosine Y759, which mediates negative regulation through the feedback inhibitor SOCS3 and the protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP2. Signalling of leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF), ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), cardiotrophin-1 (CT-1), CT-1-like factor (CLC) or oncostatin M (OSM) through gp130/LIF-R is believed to be similar due to the presence of the common signal transducer gp130 within the receptor complexes utilized, but the difference in the composition of gp130/gp130-homodimers and gp130/LIF-R-heterodimers is likely to be reflected in different signalling. Here, we analysed the contribution of the LIF-R within the gp130/LIF-R complex to negative regulation mediated by SHP2 and SOCS3. We show that SHP2 contributes to the negative regulation of signalling through gp130/LIF-R complexes. The inhibitory tyrosine motifs within the cytoplasmic parts of gp130 and the LIF-R act independently. Whereas SHP2 and SOCS3 bind directly to the inhibitory motif of gp130, only SHP2 was found to bind to the corresponding inhibitory sequence of the LIF-R. This observation was further corroborated by experiments indicating that mainly gp130 contributes to the inhibition of signalling by SOCS3.","['Clahsen, Thomas', 'Lehmann, Ute', 'Stross, Claudia', 'Hermanns, Heike M', 'Volkmer-Engert, Rudolf', 'Schneider-Mergener, Jens', 'Heinrich, Peter C', 'Schaper, Fred']","['Clahsen T', 'Lehmann U', 'Stross C', 'Hermanns HM', 'Volkmer-Engert R', 'Schneider-Mergener J', 'Heinrich PC', 'Schaper F']","['Department of Biochemistry, Medical School RWTH Aachen, Pauwelsstrasse 30, D-52074 Aachen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Cell Signal,Cellular signalling,8904683,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (IL6ST protein, human)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (LIFR protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (SOCS3 protein, human)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 3 Protein)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (PTPN11 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Motifs', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130', 'Down-Regulation', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases/metabolism', 'Receptors, Cytokine/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF', 'Repressor Proteins/metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 3 Protein', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Tyrosine/*metabolism']",2005/02/03 09:00,2005/05/27 09:00,['2005/02/03 09:00'],"['2004/08/04 00:00 [received]', '2004/09/10 00:00 [revised]', '2004/09/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/02/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/05/27 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0898-6568(04)00210-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cellsig.2004.09.016 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Signal. 2005 May;17(5):559-69. doi: 10.1016/j.cellsig.2004.09.016.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This tripartite receptor has been shown to play important roles in the development of motor neurons, but the identity of the relevant ligand(s) is still not clearly established. Recently, we have identified two new ligands for the CNTF receptor complex. These are heterodimeric cytokines composed of cardiotrophin-like cytokine (CLC) associated either with the soluble receptor subunit cytokine-like factor-1 (CLF) or the soluble form of the binding receptor itself (sCNTFR). RESULTS: Here we show that, during development, clc is expressed in lung, kidney, vibrissae, tooth, epithelia and muscles during the period of development corresponding to when motoneuron loss is observed in mice lacking a functional CNTF receptor. In addition, we demonstrate that it is co-expressed at the single cell level with clf and cntfr, supporting the idea that CLC might be co-secreted with either CLF or sCNTFR. CONCLUSION: This expression pattern is in favor of CLC, associated either with CLF or sCNTFR, being an important player in the signal triggered by the CNTF receptor being required for motoneuron development.","['de Bovis, Beatrice', 'Derouet, Damien', 'Gauchat, Jean-Francois', 'Elson, Greg', 'Gascan, Hugues', 'Delapeyriere, Odile']","['de Bovis B', 'Derouet D', 'Gauchat JF', 'Elson G', 'Gascan H', 'Delapeyriere O']","['INSERM UMR 623, Developmental Biology Institute of Marseille (CNRS - INSERM - Univ, Mediterranee), Campus de Luminy, Case 907, 13288 Marseille Cedex 09, France. delapeyr@ibdm.univ-mrs.fr.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20050131,England,Cell Commun Signal,Cell communication and signaling : CCS,101170464,,,,2005/02/03 09:00,2005/02/03 09:00,['2005/02/03 09:00'],"['2004/07/21 00:00 [received]', '2005/01/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/02/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/02/03 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['1478-811X-3-1 [pii]', '10.1186/1478-811X-3-1 [doi]']",epublish,Cell Commun Signal. 2005 Jan 31;3(1):1. doi: 10.1186/1478-811X-3-1.,,,,,PMC548669,,,,,,,,,,,,

We attempted to assess the success rate and ramifications of full haplotype mismatch transplantation. METHODS: Four patients received stem cell transplantation from their full haplotype mismatched family donors. The conditioning regimen included total-body irradiation, intravenous busulfan, antithymocyte globulin, and fludarabine. Megadose CD34+ stem cell transplants were performed, in a dosage range between 10.9 x 10(6)/kg and 20.6 x10(6)/kg. Neither GvHD prophylaxis nor post-transplant G-CSF were administered. We monitored patients' bone marrow cellularity and peripheral blood chimerism using real-time PCR. RESULTS: All patients evidenced stable engraftment. The most frequent side effect was severe mucositis, but all patients recovered successfully, without early death. No patients exhibited acute GvHD. Two refractory patients relapsed soon after transplantation. The other 2 patients have remained in good clinical condition, with a follow-up duration of 1-4 months. CONCLUSION: Using a newly-developed conditioning regimen, we were able to circumvent GvHD and graft failure, which are the main limitations associated with full haplotype mismatch transplantation.

Most attention has been given to measurements of artificial radionuclides formed in the nuclear fuel cycle, uranium and thorium. The review concentrates on measurements on people in the UK who live or have lived in the vicinity of nuclear power sites. When UK data are unavailable, or for the purposes of comparison, information has been included from studies in other countries. Highlights of key findings of the document are listed: The concentrations of strontium-90 in bone and teeth have reflected changes in the amounts present in the environment due to fallout from nuclear testing. There are higher concentration levels of 239+240Pu in samples from West Cumbria compared with the rest of the UK. However, the levels are so low that any increase in risk of induced skeletal tumours (including leukaemia) would be very small compared with those arising from the intake of natural radionuclides. As expected there have been only a few published autopsy studies. Both tissue sample mass and radionuclide concentrations were low, leading to relatively large measurement uncertainties. Whole body measurements of 137Cs in residents in Berkshire and Oxfordshire clearly show the effect of atmospheric testing of nuclear weapons and of the Chernobyl accident. A survey of whole body 137Cs and 134Cs content following the Chernobyl accident showed that residents of Central Scotland, North-West England and North Wales had twice the radiocaesium content of residents in the rest of England and Wales. Measurements of 131I in the thyroid have been reported following the accidents at Windscale and Chernobyl for most regions of the UK. Few excretion studies have been reported although this does not diminish their importance. One study on the urinary excretion rate of 90Sr in adults and children living in the Dounreay area suggested that the results did not support this radionuclide as being the cause of increased childhood leukaemia. Similar conclusions were drawn from another study involving the assay of 239Pu. It is suggested that a national database of measurements made on members of the public should be initiated. The database would provide a means for identifying future trends.","['Hodgson, S A', 'Ham, G J', 'Youngman, M J', 'Etherington, G', 'Stradling, G N']","['Hodgson SA', 'Ham GJ', 'Youngman MJ', 'Etherington G', 'Stradling GN']","['National Radiological Protection Board, Chilton, Didcot, Oxon OX11 0RQ, UK.', 'National Radiological Protection Board, Chilton, Didcot, Oxon OX11 0RQ, UK.', 'National Radiological Protection Board, Chilton, Didcot, Oxon OX11 0RQ, UK.', 'National Radiological Protection Board, Chilton, Didcot, Oxon OX11 0RQ, UK.', 'National Radiological Protection Board, Chilton, Didcot, Oxon OX11 0RQ, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,J Radiol Prot,Journal of radiological protection : official journal of the Society for Radiological Protection,8809257,['0 (Radioisotopes)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Autopsy', 'Bone and Bones/chemistry', 'Child', 'Fetus/chemistry', 'Humans', 'Power Plants', 'Radioisotopes/*analysis', '*Radiometry', 'Tooth/chemistry', 'United Kingdom', 'Whole-Body Counting']",2005/02/03 09:00,2005/04/06 09:00,['2005/02/03 09:00'],"['2005/02/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/06 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/03 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1088/0952-4746/24/4/002 [doi]'],ppublish,J Radiol Prot. 2004 Dec;24(4):369-89. doi: 10.1088/0952-4746/24/4/002.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1088/0952-4746/24/4/002 [doi]

The data did not support social concerns of an increased risk of malignant lymphoma in the vicinity of Japanese NPPs. However, some estimates of overall excess relative risk (ERR; relative risk minus one) were statistically significantly positive for leukaemia mortality in 20 NPP municipalities compared with mortality in the remaining 80 control areas, taking into account a minimum two-year latency following the start of commercial operation. One estimate was 0.228 (95% CI: 0.074-0.404) from a simple area adjustment using the mortality in all Japan as the external baseline rate. This superficial increase is not due to leukaemia among young people, aged less than 25 years at death. The ERR estimate for ages at death of 50-74 years was confounded to be positive for leukaemia and distorted to be negative for malignant lymphoma. For leukaemia, a positive ERR estimate was seen, especially for females and during specific periods. Confounding of the ERR estimate for two causes was also seen in some NPP areas including a high adult T-cell leukaemia (ATL) area. Temporal area variations associated with ATL misclassification and a temporal increasing trend of leukaemia mortality in the elderly caused the confounding effects. Our findings do not support the hypothesis of a leukaemogenic impact of NPPs in Japan.","['Yoshimoto, Yasuhiko', 'Yoshinaga, Shinji', 'Yamamoto, Kazuhide', 'Fijimoto, Kenzo', 'Nishizawa, Kanae', 'Sasaki, Yasuhito']","['Yoshimoto Y', 'Yoshinaga S', 'Yamamoto K', 'Fijimoto K', 'Nishizawa K', 'Sasaki Y']","['Research Centre for Radiation Safety, National Institute of Radiological Sciences, Anagawa 4-9-1, Inage-ward, Chiba 263-8555, Japan. y_yoshi@nirs.go.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,J Radiol Prot,Journal of radiological protection : official journal of the Society for Radiological Protection,8809257,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', '*Environmental Exposure', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Japan/epidemiology', 'Leukemia/mortality', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/etiology/*mortality', 'Lymphoma/etiology/*mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/etiology/*mortality', '*Power Plants', 'Risk']",2005/02/03 09:00,2005/04/06 09:00,['2005/02/03 09:00'],"['2005/02/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/06 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/03 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1088/0952-4746/24/4/001 [doi]'],ppublish,J Radiol Prot. 2004 Dec;24(4):343-68. doi: 10.1088/0952-4746/24/4/001.,,,,,,,['J Radiol Prot. 2004 Dec;24(4):341-2.

In 1970 Temin, Mizutani and Baltimore discovered that this group of viruses contains a unique enzyme catalysing the synthesis of a DNA copy of the viral RNA: reverse transcriptase (RT). The discovery of RT has itself had an enormous impact on molecular biology in general, but also stimulated many premature claims of its detection in human disease. Claims by Gallo's laboratory that the cytoplasm of human leukaemia cells contained RT proved to be unfounded, as did his report in collaboration with Weiss that myeloid leukaemia contained HL23 virus, this organism proving not to be human but a laboratory contaminant of three monkey viruses. Conclusive demonstration of a retroviral involvement in human leukaemia was first provided in 1981 by Hinuma and his associates, showing that adult T-cell leukaemia (ATL), a rare form of leukaemia endemic to south-west Japan, is caused by a new retrovirus (ATLV). Other publications in December 1980 and through 1981 claimed the discovery of a new human T-cell leukaemia virus involved in mycosis fungoides (MF) and Sezary's syndrome (SS). This virus was termed HTLV by Gallo. The nucleotide sequence of ATLV is strongly conserved, that of my 1983 isolate from a black British ATL patient being practically identical with the Japanese virus isolates. After AIDS was recognised in 1981 by Gottlieb and coworkers as a new human disease, several papers were published by Gallo and his associates during 1983-4, invoking the oncovirus responsible for adult T-cell leukaemia as the cause of AIDS. In 1983 the French scientist Barre-Sinoussi and her colleagues succeeded in isolating a new agent in the disease, a lentivirus, which they named LAV. The French immunologist Klatzmann and his colleagues discovered that LAV killed CD4+ T-cells, furnishing an explanation for the pathogenesis of AIDS and providing a mechanism for how AIDS developed. For some time Gallo continued to suggest leukaemia virus involvement, claiming that his independent isolate of the AIDS virus, termed HTLV-III, was closely related to HTLV-I (the Japanese ATLV). Although this created considerable confusion among researchers for a period, the relationship was eventually disproved. Unlike ATLV, whose nucleic acid sequence is very stable, the AIDS virus (now termed HIV by international agreement) is extraordinarily unstable, the sequences of independent HIV isolates being quite unique: this made it possible to establish conclusively that both HTLV-III and another independent isolate CBL-1, from Weiss' laboratory, were actually LAV isolates from the French laboratory. It has been shown by Hayami and his associates that only African primates are infected with similar lentiviruses to HIV which explains why AIDS started in Africa. Further research has clarified the origin of HIV-1 to be a chimpanzee lentivirus and HIV-2 to be the sooty mangabey lentivirus, which began to spread in humans perhaps no more than fifty years ago. The infection has spread rapidly, primarily through sexual intercourse, but also by transmission through blood and its products as well as contaminated needles and syringes. Sexual intercourse has now spread the virus around the World; and there are probably some 70 million infected. 90% of those infected with HIV develop the deadly disease of AIDS within ten years of infection: the death toll from the disease has been enormous. By contrast, HTLV-1 has been infecting man in isolated areas probably for hundreds of years; but it has not spread widely. HTLV causes leukaemia in only less than 1% of those infected. The prime mode of transmission of HTLV-1 is between mother and neonate; infections can be reduced by stopping breast-feeding by infected mothers. The isolation of HIV enabled screening tests to be developed for contaminated blood. However, due to the peculiar biology of HIV infection, unfortunately all efforts to develop an effective vaccine have so far failed.","['Karpas, Abraham']",['Karpas A'],"['Department of Haematology, University of Cambridge Clinical School, MRC Centre, Hills Road, Cambridge CB2 2QH, UK. karpasa@hotmail.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,England,Biol Rev Camb Philos Soc,Biological reviews of the Cambridge Philosophical Society,0414576,,IM,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/epidemiology/transmission/*virology', 'Animals', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*virology', 'Retroviridae/*isolation & purification', 'Retroviridae Infections/epidemiology/transmission/*virology']",2005/02/03 09:00,2005/05/27 09:00,['2005/02/03 09:00'],"['2005/02/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/05/27 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/03 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1017/s1464793104006505 [doi]'],ppublish,Biol Rev Camb Philos Soc. 2004 Nov;79(4):911-33. doi: 10.1017/s1464793104006505.,157,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Combined analysis of origin licensing factors Mcm2 and geminin with the proliferation marker Ki67 in SLL/CLL, MCL, DLBCL and Burkitt lymphoma reveals for the first time the precise cell cycle state of these entities. Given that tight Mcm2 downregulation defines the quiescent state (G0) and that both high- and low-growth fraction lymphomas express Mcm2, the data demonstrate that neoplastic lymphocytes of SLL/CLL and MCL reside in an ""in-cycle"" G1 state and not in G0 as previously thought. Absence of the S/G2/M phase marker geminin in SLL/CLL and MCL further indicates failure of cell cycle progression in these tumours. In contrast, the high-growth fraction lymphomas DLBCL and Burkitt lymphoma exhibit differential expression of geminin, with the geminin/Ki67 ratio increasing for more aggressive neoplasms in keeping with a shortened G1 phase and thus representing an important discriminator for differential diagnosis. These data provide new insights into abrogation of cell cycle control during B cell lymphomagenesis and suggest that combined analysis of origin licensing factors may contribute to improved treatment decisions and prognosis in haematopoietic malignancies.","['Obermann, Ellen C', 'Eward, Kathryn Leigh', 'Dogan, Ahmet', 'Paul, Elizabeth A', 'Loddo, Marco', 'Munson, Philippa', 'Williams, Gareth H', 'Stoeber, Kai']","['Obermann EC', 'Eward KL', 'Dogan A', 'Paul EA', 'Loddo M', 'Munson P', 'Williams GH', 'Stoeber K']","['Department of Histopathology, University College London, Rockefeller Building, University Street, London, WC1E 6JJ, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,J Pathol,The Journal of pathology,0204634,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (GMNN protein, human)', '0 (Geminin)', '0 (Ki-67 Antigen)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', 'EC 3.6.4.12 (MCM2 protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.4.12 (Minichromosome Maintenance Complex Component 2)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/pathology', '*DNA Replication', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Flow Cytometry/methods', 'Geminin', 'Humans', 'Ki-67 Antigen/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/metabolism', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/diagnosis/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Minichromosome Maintenance Complex Component 2', 'Mitosis', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2005/02/01 09:00,2005/03/03 09:00,['2005/02/01 09:00'],"['2005/02/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/03 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/01 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/path.1695 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pathol. 2005 Feb;205(3):318-28. doi: 10.1002/path.1695.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast to normal peripheral lymphocytes, all primary ATL samples had reduced or loss of expression of two or more MMR genes, and the expression of several MMR genes was simultaneously suppressed in each ATL patient. Abnormal expression of hMSH2, hMSH3, hMSH6, hMLH1, and hPMS1 was observed more frequently than that of hPMS2. In particular, expression of hMSH2 and hPMS1 was reduced in all cases. Western blot analysis further showed reduced expression of both hMSH2 and hPMS1 proteins in all five cases examined. In three out of the 5 cases, both of the two proteins were undetectable. Interestingly, methylation-specific PCR indicated methylation of hPMS1 promoter in all of four ATL cases examined. hPMS1 expression, but not hMSH2 expression, was restored by treatment with a DNA demethylation agent, 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine, suggesting that methylation plays a crucial role in inhibition of the hPMS1 gene expression in ATL.

However, it is not commonly known to researchers that sensitivity has been associated with As2O3 concentration in target cells. Cell lines and cell strains of leukemia and solid cancer cells were treated with different concentrations of As2O3, and the concentrations were compared to apoptosis detected by FITC-annexin V and propidium iodide (PI) double staining. Results showed that intracellular and intercellular concentrations of arsenic in different cell lines differed. Our study noted that the cell lines had concentrations of arsenic trioxide in decreasing order, as follows: APL primary cell > K562 > CML primary cell > HL-60 > AML-M2 primary cell > HeLa > H-22. Higher intracellular As2O3 concentrations in cell lines APL, NB4, and K562 can be obtained by treating in culture medium with lower As2O3 concentration for longer times than the transient higher concentration. These results indicate that different leukemia and solid carcinoma cell lines have different intracellular arsenic concentrations, which correlate with different sensitivities to As2O3 in clinical treatment. The intracellular As2O3 concentration is higher; in addition, we note apoptosis, a very important observation in our study. As2O3 inhibited the growth of these cell lines significantly.

We report on 1 stratum of the study designated for adult subjects. The primary end point of the study was survival at 180 days. Secondary end points included engraftment, graft-versus-host disease, relapse, and long-term survival. Eligibility criteria for malignant and nonmalignant diseases were specified. Subjects with active central nervous system disease, Karnofsky performance status <70%, grade 3 or 4 or primary myelofibrosis, or suitable related donors were excluded. Enrollment required a single cord blood unit containing >10(7) nucleated cells per kilogram of recipient weight and matched at > or =4 HLA-A and -B (low or intermediate resolution) and -DRB1 (high resolution) types. Thirty-four subjects were entered, with a median age of 34.5 years (range, 18.2-55 years). Most subjects (n = 23) had a 4 of 6 match, 10 subjects had a 5 of 6 match, and 1 subject had a 6 of 6 match. Diagnoses at transplantation included acute myelogenous leukemia (n = 19), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n = 9), chronic myelogenous leukemia (n = 3), myelodysplastic syndrome (n = 1), paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) (n = 1), and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (n = 1); 94% were classified as poor risk according to National Marrow Donor Program criteria. Subjects received total body irradiation/cyclophosphamide (n = 27) or busulfan/melphalan (n = 7) conditioning regimens. Four subjects died before CBT and are described here but are not included in the main analysis. The cumulative incidence rates and median times to neutrophil (500/microL) and platelet (>20,000/microL) engraftment were 0.66 by day 42 (median, 31 days) and 0.35 by day 180 (median, 117 days). The cumulative incidence rate for grade II-IV GVHD was 0.34 by day 100. For the primary end point, survival at 180 days, Kaplan-Meier survival estimates were 0.30 (95% confidence interval, 0.14-0.46) by day 180 after transplantation. To date there are 2 survivors, and both are >36 months from enrollment. A retrospective analysis was performed by using high-resolution HLA-A and -B typing, which revealed that approximately one third of subjects had 1 or more additional HLA mismatches compared with results of low- or intermediate-resolution HLA typing. The findings of high treatment-related mortality and slow engraftment kinetics indicate that CBT should continue to be performed in specialized centers with a research focus on cord blood cells.","['Cornetta, Kenneth', 'Laughlin, Mary', 'Carter, Shelly', 'Wall, Donna', 'Weinthal, Joel', 'Delaney, Colleen', 'Wagner, John', 'Sweetman, Robert', 'McCarthy, Philip', 'Chao, Nelson']","['Cornetta K', 'Laughlin M', 'Carter S', 'Wall D', 'Weinthal J', 'Delaney C', 'Wagner J', 'Sweetman R', 'McCarthy P', 'Chao N']","['Department of Medical and Molecular Genetics, Indiana University School of Medicine, 975 W.

We report long-term outcomes of AHSCT for patients with relapsed low-grade NHL. Between May 1983 and 2001, 67 patients with relapsed or refractory stage III and IV low-grade NHL received an AHSCT at the University of Minnesota at a median of 2.3 years (range, 0.4-15.2 years) after diagnosis. At transplantation, 62 patients (92%) were in complete remission (CR) (6%) or partial remission (PR) (86%); 5 (8%) had resistant disease; and 9 (14%) had transformed to a higher-grade NHL. After AHSCT, 32 (49%) of 65 evaluable patients achieved CR, and 26 (40%) achieved PR. Overall survival (OS) was 50% (95% confidence interval [CI], 38%-62%) at 4 years and 33% (95% CI, 20%-46%) at both 10 and 18 years, whereas progression-free survival (PFS) was 28% (95% CI, 17%-39%) at 4 years, 18% (95% CI, 8%-28%) at 10 years, and 14% (95% CI, 4%-25%) at 18 years. Transplant-related mortality in the first 100 days was 3% (95% CI, 0%-7%). Relapse occurred in 62% (95% CI, 48%-75%) at 4 years and 72% (95% CI, 56%-87%) at 10 years. Eleven patients (16%) developed myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukemia 1 to 8 years after AHSCT, and 3 (5%) developed solid tumors. In multiple regression analysis, the International Prognostic Index (IPI) score at transplantation was the most significant predictor for both OS and PFS. The median OS has not been reached in patients with an IPI score of 0 or 1 at transplantation (20 of 35 survive 2 to 18 years after AHSCT), whereas it was 2.3 and 1.6 years for IPI scores of 2 and 3, respectively ( P = .002). A good response (CR/PR) to AHSCT (relative risk [RR], 0.4; 95% CI, 0.2-0.9; P = .04) and age <50 years (RR, 0.5; 95% CI, 0.2-0.8; P = .01) were also independently significant predictors of good OS and PFS. We present mature follow-up data (median follow-up, 8 years; range, 2-18 years) of patients undergoing AHSCT for relapsed low-grade NHL and demonstrate extended OS and PFS. Very long-term remissions were seen in nearly 20% of patients. AHSCT remains promising, especially for patients with sensitive relapse and lower IPI scores. Recurrent lymphoma after AHSCT remains the major problem, and prolonged survival is further tempered by a significant risk of post-transplantation second malignancies, including myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukemia and solid tumors.","['Laudi, Noel', 'Arora, Mukta', 'Burns, Linda J', 'Miller, Jeffrey S', 'McGlave, Philip B', 'Barker, Juliet N', 'Ramsay, Norma K C', 'Orchard, Paul J', 'Macmillan, Margaret L', 'Weisdorf, Daniel J']","['Laudi N', 'Arora M', 'Burns LJ', 'Miller JS', 'McGlave PB', 'Barker JN', 'Ramsay NK', 'Orchard PJ', 'Macmillan ML', 'Weisdorf DJ']","['Blood and Marrow Transplant Program, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/etiology/mortality', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/complications/*mortality/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/etiology/mortality', 'Recurrence', 'Risk Factors', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",2005/02/01 09:00,2005/06/16 09:00,['2005/02/01 09:00'],"['2005/02/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/16 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1083879104005993 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbmt.2004.11.017 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2005 Feb;11(2):129-35. doi: 10.1016/j.bbmt.2004.11.017.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To further improve the treatment outcome of ASCT in AML, finding a modifiable prognostic factor is mandatory. We evaluated the effect of CD34(+) cell dose on survival in allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) from HLA-matched sibling donors for AML patients in first complete remission (CR1). The 99 patients included in our analysis were classified into high CD34(+) cell dose group (CD34(+) cells > or = 2.5 x 10(6)/kg) and low CD34(+) cell dose group (CD34(+) cells < 2.5 x 10(6)/kg). The high CD34(+) cell dose patients had better overall survival (5-year overall survival rate, 75% +/- 6% vs 52% +/- 9%; P = .01) and leukemia-free survival (5-year leukemia-free survival rate, 70% +/- 6% vs 44% +/- 9%; P = .04). CD34(+) cell dose was the only independent prognostic factor in overall survival and leukemia-free survival. The high CD34(+) cell dose group had a lower relapse incidence with a borderline statistical significance (5-year relapse rate, 27% +/- 6% vs 50% +/- 10%; P = .09). There were no differences in the engraftment of neutrophil and platelet, grade II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), extensive-stage chronic GVHD, and transplant-related mortality between the high and low CD34(+) cell dose groups.

To identify prognostic factors in these patients, we performed a retrospective analysis of transplantation outcomes.

A total of 135 patients were identified. The median age was 49.5 years (range, 19-75 years). At the time of transplantation, 39.3% of patients had not responded to induction therapy, 37% had not responded to first salvage therapy, and 23.7% were beyond first salvage. Forty-one patients (30%) received unrelated donor progenitor cells. Eighty patients (59%) received either a reduced-intensity or a nonmyeloablative regimen. A total of 104 (77%) of 135 patients died, with a median survival time of 4.9 months (95% confidence interval, 3.9-6.6 months). The median progression-free survival was 2.9 months (95% confidence interval, 2.5-4.2 months). A Cox regression analysis showed that Karnofsky performance status, peripheral blood blasts, and tacrolimus exposure during the first 11 days after transplantation were predictive of survival.

Ideally, patients who undergo transplantation for malignancies would receive the minimum effective acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis to maximize the graft-versus-tumor potential of the allogeneic SCT. Tailoring acute GVHD prophylaxis to the risk for each patient has long been a goal for SCT, but no practical way to adjust acute GVHD prophylaxis has been developed. In murine models of acute GVHD, gut damage from the preparative regimen resulting in the release of many mediators is crucial for initiation of acute GVHD. Using diarrhea as a marker of gut damage, we performed a retrospective study of patients at the Johns Hopkins Hospital given matched sibling transplants for chronic myelogenous leukemia to determine whether gut damage during the preparative regimen is predictive of the development of acute GVHD in humans. Logistic regression models were used to perform the retrospective analysis of the relation of diarrhea during the preparative regimen to a significant acute GVHD grade. This work demonstrated a significant positive correlation between the sum of diarrhea on days 4 to 7 after SCT and acute GVHD and showed a borderline significant positive correlation between the sum of diarrhea on days 1 to 3 and acute GVHD. This is the first correlation demonstrated between gut damage during the preparative regimen and acute GVHD severity in humans. This suggests that damage from the preparative regimen could be used as a marker for the risk of acute GVHD. Prospective trials would have to test whether acute GVHD prophylaxis could be adjusted according to this risk. This may result in a greater graft-versus-tumor effect for patients with less risk of acute GVHD.","['Goldberg, Jenna', 'Jacobsohn, David A', 'Zahurak, Marianna L', 'Vogelsang, Georgia B']","['Goldberg J', 'Jacobsohn DA', 'Zahurak ML', 'Vogelsang GB']","['Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at John Hopkins, Baltimore, MD, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Animals', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Diarrhea/etiology/*prevention & control', 'Female', 'Gastrointestinal Diseases/etiology/*prevention & control', 'Graft vs Host Disease/complications/*prevention & control', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/therapy', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*adverse effects']",2005/02/01 09:00,2005/06/16 09:00,['2005/02/01 09:00'],"['2005/02/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/16 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1083879104005579 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbmt.2004.10.007 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2005 Feb;11(2):101-7. doi: 10.1016/j.bbmt.2004.10.007.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Lymphoma relapsed after BMT in 14 patients (38%), and at least 5 had documented or suspected CNS relapse. In multivariate models, age > or =18 years at diagnosis, resistant systemic disease, busulfan/cyclophosphamide conditioning, and lack of intrathecal consolidation after BMT were statistically significant predictors of inferior survival. The 5-year actuarial event-free survival was 36%, and overall survival was 39%. After BMT, long-term survival is thus achievable in a subset of patients with a history of treated CNS involvement by non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The survival rates are not dissimilar to those typically seen in other high-risk lymphoma patients undergoing BMT. These data suggest that patients with lymphomatous involvement of the CNS who achieve CNS remission should be offered BMT if it is otherwise indicated.","['Kasamon, Yvette L', 'Jones, Richard J', 'Piantadosi, Steven', 'Ambinder, Richard F', 'Abrams, Ross A', 'Borowitz, Michael J', 'Morrison, Candis', 'Smith, B Douglas', 'Flinn, Ian W']","['Kasamon YL', 'Jones RJ', 'Piantadosi S', 'Ambinder RF', 'Abrams RA', 'Borowitz MJ', 'Morrison C', 'Smith BD', 'Flinn IW']","['Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins, 1650 Orleans St., Baltimore, MD 21231, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms/mortality/secondary/*therapy', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/complications/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Radiotherapy', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2005/02/01 09:00,2005/06/16 09:00,['2005/02/01 09:00'],"['2005/02/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/16 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1083879104005270 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbmt.2004.09.009 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2005 Feb;11(2):93-100. doi: 10.1016/j.bbmt.2004.09.009.,,,,"['CA09071/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA096888/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA127574/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA15396/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA127574-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

CYBB transcription is restricted to myeloid cells differentiated beyond the promyelocyte stage. In undifferentiated myeloid cells, the homeodomain (HD) transcription factor HoxA10 represses CYBB transcription via a cis element in the proximal promoter. During myelopoiesis, phosphorylation of conserved tyrosine residues in the HD decreases HoxA10 binding to this CYBB cis element. In the current studies, we found HoxA9 activates CYBB transcription in differentiated myeloid cells via the same cis element. We find HoxA9-mediated CYBB-transcription requires Pbx1 but is inhibited by Meis1. Additionally, phosphorylation of the conserved HD tyrosines increases HoxA9 binding to the CYBB promoter. The HOXA9 gene is involved in leukemia-associated translocations with the gene encoding Nup98, a nucleopore protein. We find expression of a Nup98-hoxA9 fusion protein blocks HoxA9-induced CYBB transcription in differentiating myeloid cells. In comparison to HoxA9, Nup98-hoxA9 has greater binding affinity for the CYBB cis element, but binding is not altered by HD tyrosine phosphorylation. Therefore, these studies identify CYBB as a common target gene repressed by HoxA10 and activated by HoxA9. These studies also suggest overexpression of Meis1 or Nup98-hoxA9 represses myeloid-specific gene transcription, thereby contributing to differentiation block in leukemogenesis.","['Bei, Ling', 'Lu, YuFeng', 'Eklund, Elizabeth A']","['Bei L', 'Lu Y', 'Eklund EA']","['Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL 60611, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20050128,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Homeobox A10 Proteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (MEIS1 protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins)', '0 (Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (homeobox protein HOXA9)', '0 (nuclear pore complex protein 98)', '0 (pbx1 protein, human)', '140441-81-2 (HOXA10 protein, human)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 1.6.3.- (CYBB protein, human)', 'EC 1.6.3.- (NADPH Oxidase 2)', 'EC 1.6.3.- (NADPH Oxidases)', 'EC 2.3.1.28 (Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase)']",IM,"['Blotting, Western', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase/metabolism', 'Chromatin/metabolism', 'DNA, Complementary/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Homeobox A10 Proteins', 'Homeodomain Proteins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*metabolism', 'Models, Genetic', 'Mutagenesis', 'Myeloid Cells/*cytology', 'Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein', 'NADPH Oxidase 2', 'NADPH Oxidases/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins/metabolism', 'Phagocytosis', 'Phosphorylation', 'Plasmids/metabolism', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection', 'Tyrosine/chemistry', 'U937 Cells']",2005/02/01 09:00,2005/05/14 09:00,['2005/02/01 09:00'],"['2005/02/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/05/14 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(19)60562-4 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M408138200 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2005 Apr 1;280(13):12359-70. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M408138200.

We focused our study on the cytokine TRAIL (TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand), which has been shown to exhibit an anti-differentiation activity on erythroid maturation. Immunocytochemical analysis of bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMC) showed an increased expression of TRAIL in MDS patients with respect to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients and normal BM donors. TRAIL expression was increased predominantly in myeloid precursors of granulocytic lineage and in a subset of monocytes and pro-erythroblasts. Significant levels of soluble TRAIL were released in 21 of 68 BMMC culture supernatants from MDS patients. On the other hand, TRAIL was detected less frequently in the culture supernatants of AML (4 of 33) and normal BMMC (0 of 22). Analysis of peripheral blood parameters revealed significantly lower levels of peripheral red blood cells and hemoglobin in the subset of patients whose BMMC released TRAIL in culture supernatants compared to the subgroup of patients who did not release TRAIL. Moreover, TRAIL-positive BMMC culture supernatants inhibited the differentiation of normal glycophorin A+ erythroblasts generated in serum-free liquid phase. Thus, increased expression and release of TRAIL at the bone marrow level is likely to impair erythropoiesis and to contribute to the degree of anemia, the major clinical feature of MDS.","['Campioni, Diana', 'Secchiero, Paola', 'Corallini, Federica', 'Melloni, Elisabetta', 'Capitani, Silvano', 'Lanza, Francesco', 'Zauli, Giorgio']","['Campioni D', 'Secchiero P', 'Corallini F', 'Melloni E', 'Capitani S', 'Lanza F', 'Zauli G']","['Department of Morphology and Embryology, Human Anatomy Section, University of Ferrara, Via Fossato di Mortara 66, 44100 Ferrara, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Am J Pathol,The American journal of pathology,0370502,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (Culture Media, Serum-Free)', '0 (Glycophorins)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNFSF10 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Anemia/*etiology', 'Antigens, CD34/biosynthesis', 'Apoptosis', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism', 'Culture Media, Conditioned/pharmacology', 'Culture Media, Serum-Free/metabolism', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Erythrocytes/metabolism', 'Female', 'Fetal Blood/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Glycophorins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/metabolism', 'Ligands', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/metabolism/*physiology', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*blood/complications/etiology', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/metabolism/*physiology']",2005/02/01 09:00,2005/03/30 09:00,['2005/02/01 09:00'],"['2005/02/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/30 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0002-9440(10)62277-8 [pii]', '10.1016/S0002-9440(10)62277-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Pathol. 2005 Feb;166(2):557-63. doi: 10.1016/S0002-9440(10)62277-8.,,,,,PMC1602326,,,,,,,,,,,,

A MGB probe forms extremely stable duplexes with single-stranded DNA targets, allowing the use of shorter probes for hybridization-based assays. Therefore, it shows positional flexibility. We have designed two novel consensus MGB JH germline probes for analyzing all of the germline rearrangements registered in the V BASE database, and demonstrated that the MRD was detectable with the probes in 17 cases of childhood ALL. The actual copy number for the targets and dynamic changes before and after treatment were almost identical between the JH MGB probe and conventional non-MGB probes in each patient.

Multiple chimeric transcripts translate to proteins of 190 or 210 kd and, rarely, 230 kd. CML typically carries p210 BCR-ABL while ALL is most often associated with p190. Detection and quantification of these fusion transcripts is useful in clinical management. We have exploited the unique melting profiles of these transcripts to design a new, simple, and cost-effective assay based on monochrome multiplex real-time RT-PCR for identification and quantification of each of these transcripts (b3-a2, b2-a2, and e1-a2) without further manipulation. The sensitivity of this assay was 10(-4) for e1-a2 and 10(-5) for b3-a2/b2-a2, which is appropriate for detection of minimal residual disease (MRD). Inter- and intra-assay variation was minimal. We applied this assay to assess the distribution of p190 and p210 in 260 childhood ALL samples from India. BCR-ABL was detected in 19 (7.3%), including one T-ALL. Eight patients (3.1%) demonstrated mBCR-ABL (p190) and 11 (4.2%) had MBCR-ABL (p210). Transcript levels varied markedly (up to 3000-fold) but e1-a2 were generally expressed at higher levels than b3/b2-a2 (P = 0.05).

A small interfering RNA knockdown of the clathrin heavy chain and quantitative electron microscopy of hematopoietic leukemia cells showed that the majority of Ads were phagocytosed as clusters of 1 to 3 microm in diameter and that about 10% of the particles entered cells by clathrin-mediated endocytosis. The clathrin knockdown did not affect phagocytosis but, surprisingly, inhibited viral escape from phagosomes. Similarly, blocking an early stage of clathrin-coated pit assembly inhibited phagosomal escape and infection but not aggregate uptake, unlike blocking of a late stage of clathrin-coated pit formation. We propose a cooperative interaction of clathrin-mediated endocytosis and phagocytosis triggering phagosomal lysis and infection.","['Meier, Oliver', 'Gastaldelli, Michele', 'Boucke, Karin', 'Hemmi, Silvio', 'Greber, Urs F']","['Meier O', 'Gastaldelli M', 'Boucke K', 'Hemmi S', 'Greber UF']","['Zoologisches Institut, University of Zurich, 8057 Zurich, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (CLMP protein, human)', '0 (Clathrin)', '0 (Coxsackie and Adenovirus Receptor-Like Membrane Protein)', '0 (Receptors, IgG)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)']",IM,"['Adenoviruses, Human/*physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Clathrin/physiology', 'Coxsackie and Adenovirus Receptor-Like Membrane Protein', 'Endocytosis/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Phagocytosis/physiology', 'Receptors, IgG/*physiology', 'Receptors, Virus/*physiology']",2005/02/01 09:00,2005/08/10 09:00,['2005/02/01 09:00'],"['2005/02/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/10 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['79/4/2604 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.79.4.2604-2613.2005 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2005 Feb;79(4):2604-13. doi: 10.1128/JVI.79.4.2604-2613.2005.,,,,,PMC546601,,,,,,,,,,,,

Signals emanating from the SH2 domain of the protein are required for transformation, and several proteins bind this region of v-Abl. One such protein is the adaptor molecule Shc, a protein that complexes with Grb2/Sos and facilitates Ras activation, an event associated with Ab-MLV transformation. To test the role this interaction plays in growth and survival of infected pre-B cells, dominant-negative (DN) Shc proteins were coexpressed with v-Abl and transformation was examined. Expression of DN Shc reduced Ab-MLV pre-B-cell transformation and decreased the ability of v-Abl to stimulate Ras activation and Erk phosphorylation in a Raf-dependent but Rac-independent fashion. Further analysis revealed that Shc is required for v-Abl-mediated Raf tyrosine 340 and 341 phosphorylation, an event associated with Erk phosphorylation. In contrast to effects on proliferation, survival of the cells and activation of Akt were not affected by expression of DN Shc. Together, these data reveal that v-Abl-Shc interactions are a critical part of the growth stimulatory signals delivered during transformation but that they do not affect antiapoptotic pathways. Furthermore, these data highlight a novel role for Shc in signaling from v-Abl to Raf.","['Baughn, Linda B', 'Rosenberg, Naomi']","['Baughn LB', 'Rosenberg N']","['Immunology Graduate Program, Sacker School of Graduate Biomedicals Sciences, Tufts University School of Medicine, Boston, MA 02111, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (GRB2 Adaptor Protein)', '0 (GRB2 protein, human)', '0 (SHC1 protein, human)', '0 (Shc Signaling Adaptor Proteins)', '0 (Src Homology 2 Domain-Containing, Transforming Protein 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ras Proteins)']",IM,"['Abelson murine leukemia virus/chemistry/genetics/*physiology', 'Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/*metabolism', 'Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Transformation, Viral/*physiology', 'GRB2 Adaptor Protein', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Humans', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Shc Signaling Adaptor Proteins', 'Signal Transduction', 'Src Homology 2 Domain-Containing, Transforming Protein 1', 'ras Proteins/metabolism']",2005/02/01 09:00,2005/08/10 09:00,['2005/02/01 09:00'],"['2005/02/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/10 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['79/4/2325 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.79.4.2325-2334.2005 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2005 Feb;79(4):2325-34. doi: 10.1128/JVI.79.4.2325-2334.2005.,,,,['CA 24420/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC546584,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, it is imperative to develop a highly sensitive and specific immunoassay for clinical surveillance in patients receiving xenotransplantation. We describe here the generation of a monoclonal antibody (mAb) named A-11 specifically against the Gag protein of PERV. The mAb was found to be able to detect PERV produced from cultured cells. No cross-reaction with Gag proteins of murine leukemia virus (MuLV) and human immunodeficiency virus-1/2 was observed indicating that it is highly specific to PERV. The mAb was characterized as IgG2b subtype and kappa light chain. The region recognized by the mAb A-11 was localized to amino acid 293-336 on the Gag protein, and a synthetic peptide corresponding to amino acid 313-322 effectively competed the binding of the mAb with recombinant Gag proteins. Both immunocytochemistry and flow cytometry showed that the antibody is suitable for detection of PERV infection. By using the assays, we found that PERV-infected cells primarily of epithelial origin, with the highest infection rate in 293 followed by HEp-2 cells. In summary, the A-11 mAb will be useful for the development of quantitative and qualitative immunoassays for monitoring PERV infection in xenotransplantation patients and individuals who have close contact with pigs.","['Chiang, Chen-Yi', 'Chang, Jen-Ting', 'Lin, Meng-Shiue', 'Wang, Shih-Rong', 'Chang, Hwan-You']","['Chiang CY', 'Chang JT', 'Lin MS', 'Wang SR', 'Chang HY']","['Insitute of Molecular Medicine, National Tsing-Hua University, 101 Section 2 Kuang Fu Road, Hsin-Chu, Taiwan 300, ROC.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,Virus Res,Virus research,8410979,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Antibodies, Monoclonal', '*Antibodies, Viral', 'Cell Line', 'Endogenous Retroviruses/*immunology/*isolation & purification', 'Epitope Mapping', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Products, gag/*immunology', 'HIV-1/immunology', 'HIV-2/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunochemistry', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/immunology', 'Retroviridae Infections/*diagnosis/virology', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Swine/virology']",2005/02/01 09:00,2005/08/19 09:00,['2005/02/01 09:00'],"['2004/05/21 00:00 [received]', '2004/08/27 00:00 [revised]', '2004/08/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/02/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/19 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0168-1702(04)00343-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.virusres.2004.08.022 [doi]']",ppublish,Virus Res. 2005 Mar;108(1-2):139-48. doi: 10.1016/j.virusres.2004.08.022.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to extract useful gene information from cancer microarray data and reduce dimensionality, feature selection algorithms were systematically investigated in this study. Using a correlation-based feature selector combined with machine learning algorithms such as decision trees, naive Bayes and support vector machines, we show that classification performance at least as good as published results can be obtained on acute leukemia and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma microarray data sets.

Most of its in vivo effects were revealed only on male animals. We have studied HLDF-6 effects on a variety of organism functions and behavioral reactions, which are known to be dependent on androgen steroid hormones, both on castrated and normal (sham-operated) animals. Male NMRI mice were castrated or sham-operated at the age of 55 days (after puberty). After that, HLDF-6 peptide was injected daily during 3 weeks, followed by behavioral, morphological and biochemical testing. HLDF-6 increased testosterone level (1.5- to 2-fold) both in sham-operated and castrated animals. Sexual activity and pain sensitivity, which are strongly reduced in castrates, were completely or partially recovered by HLDF-6. At the same time, the peptide caused some effects similar to castration in sham-operated animals: aggression and locomotor activity were decreased; oral grooming was prolonged. Morphological studies of accessory sex glands showed that HLDF-6 partially normalizes the morphology and functional activity of seminal vesicles in castrates, but it does not prevent castration-induced apoptosis of prostate epithelial cells. Based on these observations, we can assume that HLDF-6 peptide displays at least two effects on androgen hormones metabolism in males: it stimulates testosterone biosynthesis by both testes and adrenals and simultaneously inhibits its conversion to dihydrotestosterone (DHT), most probably by diminution of 5alpha-reductase isoform 1 mRNA expression.","['Rzhevsky, D I', 'Zhokhov, S S', 'Babichenko, I I', 'Goleva, A V', 'Goncharenko, E N', 'Baizhumanov, A A', 'Murashev, A N', 'Lipkin, V M', 'Kostanyan, I A']","['Rzhevsky DI', 'Zhokhov SS', 'Babichenko II', 'Goleva AV', 'Goncharenko EN', 'Baizhumanov AA', 'Murashev AN', 'Lipkin VM', 'Kostanyan IA']","['Branch of Shemyakin-Ovchinnikov Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry, Russian Academy of Sciences, 142290 Pushchino, Moscow Region, Russia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,Regul Pept,Regulatory peptides,8100479,"['0 (Androgens)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (cell differentiation factor 8.2-kDa)', '3XMK78S47O (Testosterone)', '4TI98Z838E (Estradiol)', 'W980KJ009P (Corticosterone)']",IM,"['Androgens/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Behavior, Animal/*drug effects', 'Corticosterone/blood', 'Estradiol/blood', 'Genitalia, Male/cytology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Motor Activity/drug effects', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', '*Orchiectomy', 'Organ Size', 'Peptides/genetics/*metabolism', 'Testosterone/blood']",2005/02/01 09:00,2005/09/24 09:00,['2005/02/01 09:00'],"['2004/05/18 00:00 [received]', '2004/11/02 00:00 [revised]', '2004/11/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/02/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/24 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0167-0115(04)00405-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.regpep.2004.11.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Regul Pept. 2005 Apr 15;127(1-3):111-21. doi: 10.1016/j.regpep.2004.11.005.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our previous study has demonstrated that TAS-103, a topoisomerase inhibitor, induces apoptosis through DNA cleavage and subsequent H(2)O(2) generation mediated by NAD(P)H oxidase activation [H. Mizutani et al. J. Biol. Chem. 277 (2002) 30684-30689]. Therefore, to clarify whether DOX functions as an anticancer drug through the same mechanism or not, we investigated the mechanism of apoptosis induced by DOX in the human leukemia cell line HL-60 and the H(2)O(2)-resistant sub-clone, HP100. DOX-induced DNA ladder formation could be detected in HL-60 cells after a 7 h incubation, whereas it could not be detected under the same condition in HP100 cells, suggesting the involvement of H(2)O(2)-mediated pathways in apoptosis. Flow cytometry revealed that H(2)O(2) formation preceded the increase in Delta Psi m and caspase-3 activation. Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and NAD(P)H oxidase inhibitors prevented DOX-induced DNA ladder formation in HL-60 cells. Moreover, DOX significantly induced formation of 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine, an indicator of oxidative DNA damage, in HL-60 cells at 1 h, but not in HP100 cells. DOX-induced apoptosis was mainly initiated by oxidative DNA damage in comparison with the ability of other topoisomerase inhibitors (TAS-103, amrubicin and amrubicinol) to cause DNA cleavage and apoptosis. These results suggest that the critical apoptotic trigger of DOX is considered to be oxidative DNA damage by the DOX-induced direct H(2)O(2) generation, although DOX-induced apoptosis may involve topoisomerase II inhibition. This oxidative DNA damage causes indirect H(2)O(2) generation through PARP and NAD(P)H oxidase activation, leading to the Delta Psi m increase and subsequent caspase-3 activation in DOX-induced apoptosis.","['Mizutani, Hideki', 'Tada-Oikawa, Saeko', 'Hiraku, Yusuke', 'Kojima, Michio', 'Kawanishi, Shosuke']","['Mizutani H', 'Tada-Oikawa S', 'Hiraku Y', 'Kojima M', 'Kawanishi S']","['Department of Environmental and Molecular Medicine, Mie University School of Medicine, Tsu, Mie 514-8507, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20050120,Netherlands,Life Sci,Life sciences,0375521,"['0 (Aminoquinolines)', '0 (Anthracyclines)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Indenes)', '0 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase Inhibitors)', '0 (Topoisomerase I Inhibitors)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', ""88847-89-6 (8-Hydroxy-2'-Deoxyguanosine)"", '9007-49-2 (DNA)', '93N13LB4Z2 (amrubicin)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'EC 1.6.3.- (NADPH Oxidases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'G9481N71RO (Deoxyguanosine)', 'YVC96489QV', '(6-((2-(dimethylamino)ethyl)amino)-3-hydroxy-7H-indeno(2,1-c)quinolin-7-one)']",IM,"[""8-Hydroxy-2'-Deoxyguanosine"", 'Aminoquinolines/pharmacology', 'Anthracyclines/pharmacology', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'DNA/biosynthesis/genetics', 'DNA Damage/drug effects', 'Deoxyguanosine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Doxorubicin/*pharmacology', 'Electrochemistry', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/*metabolism', 'Indenes/pharmacology', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects', 'NADPH Oxidases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase Inhibitors', 'Topoisomerase I Inhibitors']",2005/02/01 09:00,2005/03/02 09:00,['2005/02/01 09:00'],"['2004/02/29 00:00 [received]', '2004/05/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/02/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/02 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0024-3205(04)00987-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.lfs.2004.05.040 [doi]']",ppublish,Life Sci. 2005 Feb 11;76(13):1439-53. doi: 10.1016/j.lfs.2004.05.040.

Recent studies demonstrating that PPARgamma occurs in macrophages have focused attention on its role in macrophage functions. In this study, we investigated the effect of thiazolidinediones on monocyte proliferation and migration in vitro and the mechanisms involved. In addition, we examined the therapeutic potentials of thiazolidinediones for injured atherosclerotic lesions. Troglitazone and pioglitazone, the two thiazolidinediones, as well as 15-deoxy-delta12,14-prostaglandin J2 inhibited in a dose-dependent manner the serum-induced proliferation of THP-1 (human monocytic leukemia cells) and of U937 (human monoblastic leukemia cells), which permanently express PPARgamma. These ligands for PPARgamma also significantly inhibited migration of THP-1 induced by monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1). Troglitazone and 15-deoxy-delta12,14-prostaglandin J2 significantly suppressed the mRNA expression of the MCP family-specific receptor CCR2 (chemokine CCR2 receptor) in THP-1 at the transcriptional level.

Cell lysates were run on 2D gel electrophoresis with subsequent in-gel digestion and MALDI-TOF-TOF analysis. A series of 10 hypothetical proteins (HPs) were observed and three of these proteins, hypothetical protein (Q9BTE6), CGI-83 protein (Q9Y392) and similar to CG11334 (Q9BV20), were so far described in tumors exclusively. The other seven proteins were already detected at the transcriptional level in normal and tumor cell lines or tissues.

The assay is based on differential immunostaining of both leukaemic cells and effector cells in combination with propidium iodide (PI). The cytometer is set for measuring the fluorescence of the monoclonal antibody (mAb) bound fluorochromes, with moderate overcompensation of the third and fourth fluorescence signals. PI-positive events were excluded from analysis by their characteristic uncompensated signal on these two detectors. Thus, all four fluorescence ranges can be used for detection of mAb-derived signals and this allows discrimination between various populations contained in effector and target cell samples. The cytotoxic activity in our assay is calculated by the absolute loss of vital leukaemic cells. For this purpose, fluorescent beads are included as an internal standard. When calculating the effector concentrations after coculture, characteristic changes can be seen which yield additional information about the presence of cytotoxic activity and the active effector cell subset. With this assay, we present a versatile tool that combines minimum cell manipulation before coculture with maximum information from a sample. The assay is suitable for the analysis of complex samples with regard to different cell subsets, their decrease or increase, and conjugate formation.","['Zimmermann, Stefanie-Yvonne', 'Esser, Ruth', 'Rohrbach, Eckhard', 'Klingebiel, Thomas', 'Koehl, Ulrike']","['Zimmermann SY', 'Esser R', 'Rohrbach E', 'Klingebiel T', 'Koehl U']","['Laboratory for Stem Cell Transplantation and Immunotherapy, Paediatric Haematology, Oncology and Haemostaseology, Johann Wolfgang Goethe-Universitat, Theodor-Stern-Kai 7, Frankfurt am Main, Germany. stefanie.zimmermann@kgu.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20041219,Netherlands,J Immunol Methods,Journal of immunological methods,1305440,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (CD4 Antigens)', '0 (CD8 Antigens)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '36015-30-2 (Propidium)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/chemistry/immunology', 'Blood Cells/immunology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/immunology', 'CD4 Antigens/analysis/immunology', 'CD8 Antigens/analysis/immunology', 'Color', 'Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic/*methods', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/chemistry/*immunology', 'Leukemia/*immunology/pathology', 'Propidium/chemistry', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/chemistry/*immunology']",2005/02/01 09:00,2005/04/09 09:00,['2005/02/01 09:00'],"['2004/01/07 00:00 [received]', '2004/09/15 00:00 [revised]', '2004/10/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/02/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/09 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0022-1759(04)00389-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jim.2004.10.014 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol Methods. 2005 Jan;296(1-2):63-76. doi: 10.1016/j.jim.2004.10.014.

There are no statistical differences in mast cell numbers in reactive mastocytosis and SMCD; however, SMCD usually reveals dyspoietic mast cells and other dyspoietic bone marrow elements. In addition, SMCD is frequently (45%) associated with myeloproliferative disorders (MPDs) (17%) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs) (28%). Thus, it has been suggested that SMCD may represent one aspect of a hematologic disorder that involves multiple bone marrow lineages. OBJECTIVE: To perform a systematic evaluation of MPDs and MDSs without SMCD for dyspoietic mast cells. DESIGN: A total of 55 MPDs or MDSs were reviewed, including 20 cytogenetically proven chronic myeloid leukemias, 6 essential thrombocythemias, 2 polycythemia veras, 21 cytogenetically proven MDSs, and 6 chronic myelomonocytic leukemias. Cases of idiopathic myelofibrosis were not included due to lack of spicules. The bone marrow aspirates were reviewed for an increase in mast cells (1+ to 3+), dyspoietic features within mast cells (decreased cytoplasmic granularity, uneven granule distribution), and a predominance of fusiform mast cells. RESULTS: All cases, except 2 MDSs, had evaluable bone marrow spicules. Of interest, the MPDs were significantly more associated with increased and dyspoietic mast cells (57% and 61%, respectively) than were the MDSs (11% and 4%, respectively). The 2 polycythemia veras and 6 chronic myelomonocytic leukemias did not reveal increased or dyspoietic mast cells. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that MPDs (chronic myeloid leukemia and essential thrombocythemia) frequently contain neoplastic mast cells as the spectrum of abnormal bone marrow cells. This feature, in conjunction with other parameters, may possibly be useful in the differential diagnosis of MPDs and MDSs. Our findings, compared with the previously reported findings in SMCD, suggest that SMCD may be more closely related to MPDs than to MDSs.","['Dunphy, Cherie H']",['Dunphy CH'],"['Division of Hematopathology, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill 27599-7525, USA. cdunphy@unch.unc.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Arch Pathol Lab Med,Archives of pathology & laboratory medicine,7607091,,IM,"['Cytodiagnosis/methods', 'Cytogenetic Analysis/methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/pathology', 'Mast Cells/*pathology', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/diagnosis/genetics/*pathology', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*pathology', 'Polycythemia Vera/pathology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Thrombocythemia, Essential/pathology']",2005/02/01 09:00,2005/07/08 09:00,['2005/02/01 09:00'],"['2005/02/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/08 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['OA4208 [pii]', '10.5858/2005-129-219-EOMCIM [doi]']",ppublish,Arch Pathol Lab Med. 2005 Feb;129(2):219-22. doi: 10.5858/2005-129-219-EOMCIM.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVE: To study a quicker, simpler, and less expensive method of quantitative analysis using real-time polymerase chain reaction based on the SYBR Green I method of CMV detection for appropriate treatment of CMV infection in immunocompromised patients. DESIGN: We quantified 50 samples tested by direct immunoperoxidase staining of leukocytes with peroxidase-labeled monoclonal antibody (C7-HRP test), 30 samples from healthy persons, and 47 samples from 7 patients suspected of having CMV infection diseases. We used the primer set in the pp65 gene of CMV and whole blood without a preparatory process. The setting for the study was the First Department of Pathology, Kurume University School of Medicine, St Mary's Hospital, and the Gene Section of the Clinical Laboratory at St Mary's Hospital, Fukuoka, Japan. RESULTS: The results obtained with this method corresponded well with conventional C7-HRP tests and demonstrated excellent reproduction. Additionally, the results were better correlated with the clinical course than were C7-HRP tests. CONCLUSIONS: This method was more useful than the C7-HRP test as a rapid diagnostic test for early treatment of CMV infection. This test also demonstrated its usefulness for monitoring CMV infection during treatment using ganciclovir.

However, no specific treatments were started at this point because a cervical lymph node biopsy failed to show malignancy and the patient's signs and symptoms resolved spontaneously. Two months later, oral prednisolone therapy was started due to recurrence of the fever and erythema, but resulted in exacerbation of the skin lesions and generalized lymphadenopathy. A biopsy of the right inguinal lymph node performed in January 2000 revealed proliferation of lymphoblastic cells positive for CD3, CD5 and NSE with a rearrangement of T cell receptor gene Jdelta, leading to the diagnosis of lymphoblastic lymphoma.

We describe here the prognostic efficacy of real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR)-based analysis of major bcr/abl mRNA in cases of Philadelphia chromosome-positive leukemia (Ph-leukemia). Twenty-one patients with Ph-leukemia were enrolled as subjects to determine the usefulness of RQ-PCR-based measurement of bcr-abl/abl ratios. Imatinib mesylate (imatinib) was administered to seven of the 21 patients before allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT). Hematological relapse or failure of treatment with SCT was observed in 2 of those patients who showed bcr-abl/abl ratios of more than 0.002%, and 5 of the 7 patients showed both RQ-PCR and RT-PCR negativity immediately after SCT. All of the 5 patients who did not receive imatinib before allogeneic SCT showed RQ-PCR negativity immediately after SCT, but the results of RT-PCR were positive in 3 patients at the same time points, and those became negative after donor lymphocyte infusion or the appearance of graft-versus-host disease. Administration of imatinib before SCT was thought to induce an early remission. On the other hand, 8 patients who received imatinib without SCT showed a remarkable decrease in bcr-abl/abl ratios. The ratio gradually rose in one patient with Ph+ALL, enabling prediction of the hematological relapse preceding detection by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis. Standardization of RQ-PCR analysis of bcr-abl mRNA will help to predict early hematological relapse in patients with MRD. In conclusion, it is thought that measurement of RQ-PCR-based major bcr/abl mRNA in patients who were given imatinib and were treated with SCT is useful for the evaluation of MRD and in deciding additional treatment.","['Takahata, Mutsumi', 'Hashino, Satoshi', 'Fujisawa, Fumie', 'Kondo, Takeshi', 'Ota, Syuichi', 'Kobayashi, Sumiko', 'Tanaka, Junji', 'Imamura, Masahiro', 'Asaka, Masahiro']","['Takahata M', 'Hashino S', 'Fujisawa F', 'Kondo T', 'Ota S', 'Kobayashi S', 'Tanaka J', 'Imamura M', 'Asaka M']","['Department of Gastroenterology and Hematology, Hokkaido University Graduate School of Medicine.']",['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,Japan,Rinsho Ketsueki,[Rinsho ketsueki] The Japanese journal of clinical hematology,2984782R,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Female', 'Genes, abl/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/*mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis']",2005/02/01 09:00,2005/04/23 09:00,['2005/02/01 09:00'],"['2005/02/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/23 09:00 [medline]', '2005/02/01 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Rinsho Ketsueki. 2004 Dec;45(12):1241-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present two cases were leukemia which showed pulmonary findings in their therapeutic course, resulting in lung resection. In both cases the lung ball was confirmed histopathologically. Immunostaining of the lung tissue for neutrophil elastase showed elastase in various sites in the bronchial wall, pulmonary blood vessels (artery, vein) and cavitary wall. In our previous studies, much importance was attached to the disturbance of the pulmonary circulation caused by fibrin deposition as a factor in the developmental course of the fungus ball type aspergillosis (semi-invasive type). The circulatory disturbance of the lung was recognized also in the present cases. This two-way destruction of the pulmonary tissue, resulting from both neutrophil elastase activities and pulmonary circulatory disturbances, were regarded as the most important factor for the development of the lung ball.

The levels of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) expression and the number of GFAP-positive astrocytes increased markedly with the addition of LIF or BMP-2, and were enhanced further with the addition of both LIF and BMP-2. The number of O1-positive oligodendrocytes increased with the addition of LIF, whereas it decreased with the addition of BMP-2. The number did not change with the addition of both cytokines. Using antibody against platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), we then excluded indirect effects of these cytokines through PDGF, which would increase by accelerated astrocyte development. When PDGF was neutralized, the number of oligodendrocytes increased under all conditions examined. As a result of the neutralization, the effect of BMP-2 on oligodendrocyte differentiation was eliminated, although LIF remained effective. These results suggest that the differentiation of oligodendrocytes was delayed partially by PDGF even in control cultures. It is also suggested that LIF and BMP-2, each of which accelerates the differentiation and development of astrocytes, would seem to have different effects on oligodendrocyte differentiation, i.e., LIF would directly affect oligodendrocyte differentiation, whereas BMP-2 would affect it mainly through PDGF.","['Adachi, Tatsumi', 'Takanaga, Hiromi', 'Kunimoto, Manabu', 'Asou, Hiroaki']","['Adachi T', 'Takanaga H', 'Kunimoto M', 'Asou H']","['Department of Basic Medical Sciences, National Institute for Minamata Disease, Minamata, Kumamoto, Japan. taadachi@nimd.go.jp']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Neurosci Res,Journal of neuroscience research,7600111,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Bmp2 protein, rat)', '0 (Bone Morphogenetic Protein 2)', '0 (Bone Morphogenetic Proteins)', '0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (Culture Media, Serum-Free)', '0 (Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Platelet-Derived Growth Factor)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '47165-04-8 (DAPI)', 'EC 1.14.16.2 (Tyrosine 3-Monooxygenase)']",IM,"['Analysis of Variance', 'Animals', 'Antibodies/pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western/methods', 'Bone Morphogenetic Protein 2', 'Bone Morphogenetic Proteins/*pharmacology', 'Cell Count/methods', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cerebral Cortex/*cytology', 'Culture Media, Conditioned/pharmacology', 'Culture Media, Serum-Free/pharmacology', 'Drug Interactions', 'Embryo, Mammalian', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein/metabolism', 'Immunohistochemistry/methods', 'Indoles/metabolism', 'Interleukin-6/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Male', 'Neuroglia/cytology/*drug effects', 'Platelet-Derived Growth Factor/immunology/metabolism', 'Pregnancy', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/*pharmacology', 'Tyrosine 3-Monooxygenase/metabolism']",2005/01/29 09:00,2005/05/10 09:00,['2005/01/29 09:00'],"['2005/01/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/05/10 09:00 [medline]', '2005/01/29 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jnr.20373 [doi]'],ppublish,J Neurosci Res. 2005 Mar 1;79(5):608-15. doi: 10.1002/jnr.20373.,,,,,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,

The present study explored whether nestin immunoreactivity (nestin-ir) is present in the rat pituitary and in which cell type(s). Nestin-ir was observed in scattered cells in the anterior, intermediate, and neural lobes. Nestin-ir cells were predominantly of stellate shape and were more numerous in immature than in adult animals. Nestin-ir did not colocalize with any pituitary hormone, and did not colocalize or only very sporadically with the folliculo-stellate cell marker S100. In the intermediate lobe, nestin-ir cells contained glial fibrillary acidic protein in an age-dependent manner. Nestin-ir cells were closely associated with endothelial and fibronectin-ir cells, but did mostly not coincide. Nestin-ir was not found in alpha-smooth muscle actin-ir myofibroblasts or in microglial cells. Regardless of age, nestin-ir was detected in some unidentifiable cells that border the pituitary cleft. Nestin-ir remained present in pituitary cultured as three-dimensional aggregates. Treatment with basic fibroblast growth factor or leukemia inhibitory factor increased the number of nestin-ir cells. Starting from anterior lobe cell monolayer cultures, nestin-ir cells could be selected and propagated to a virtually pure population. These nestin-ir cells displayed remarkable motility and proliferative activity, and did not express hormones, glial fibrillary acidic protein, or S100, but contained vimentin-, fibronectin-, and alpha-smooth muscle actin-ir. In conclusion, nestin-ir is present in the pituitary in cells that are neither hormonal nor typical folliculo-stellate. The expression pattern depends on age and lobe examined. Pericapillar localization suggests a pericyte phenotype for some of them. Whether the heterogeneous nestin-ir population also contains pituitary progenitor cells remains to be explored.","['Krylyshkina, Olga', 'Chen, Jianghai', 'Mebis, Liese', 'Denef, Carl', 'Vankelecom, Hugo']","['Krylyshkina O', 'Chen J', 'Mebis L', 'Denef C', 'Vankelecom H']","['Laboratory of Cell Pharmacology, Department of Molecular Cell Biology, University of Leuven, Campus Gasthuisberg, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20050127,United States,Endocrinology,Endocrinology,0375040,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Fibronectins)', '0 (Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein)', '0 (Hormones)', '0 (Intermediate Filament Proteins)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Nes protein, rat)', '0 (Nestin)', '0 (S100 Proteins)', '0 (Vimentin)']",IM,"['Actins/analysis', 'Aging', 'Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Female', 'Fibronectins/analysis', 'Gene Expression', 'Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein/analysis', 'Hormones/*analysis', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Intermediate Filament Proteins/*analysis/genetics', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/*analysis/genetics', 'Nestin', 'Pituitary Gland/*chemistry/*cytology', 'Pituitary Gland, Anterior/chemistry/cytology', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'S100 Proteins/analysis', 'Tissue Culture Techniques', 'Vimentin/analysis']",2005/01/29 09:00,2005/05/25 09:00,['2005/01/29 09:00'],"['2005/01/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/05/25 09:00 [medline]', '2005/01/29 09:00 [entrez]']","['en.2004-1209 [pii]', '10.1210/en.2004-1209 [doi]']",ppublish,Endocrinology. 2005 May;146(5):2376-87. doi: 10.1210/en.2004-1209.

However, a significant proportion of patients chronically treated with imatinib develop resistance because of the acquisition of mutations in the kinase domain of BCR-ABL. Mutations occur at residues directly implicated in imatinib binding or, more commonly, at residues important for the ability of the kinase to adopt the specific closed (inactive) conformation to which imatinib binds. In our quest to develop new BCR-ABL inhibitors, we chose to target regions outside the ATP-binding site of this enzyme because these compounds offer the potential to be unaffected by mutations that make CML cells resistant to imatinib. Here we describe the activity of one compound, ON012380, that can specifically inhibit BCR-ABL and induce cell death of Ph+ CML cells at a concentration of <10 nM. Kinetic studies demonstrate that this compound is not ATP-competitive but is substrate-competitive and works synergistically with imatinib in wild-type BCR-ABL inhibition. More importantly, ON012380 was found to induce apoptosis of all of the known imatinib-resistant mutants at concentrations of <10 nM concentration in vitro and cause regression of leukemias induced by i.v. injection of 32Dcl3 cells expressing the imatinib-resistant BCR-ABL isoform T315I. Daily i.v. dosing for up to 3 weeks with a >100 mg/kg concentration of this agent is well tolerated in rodents, without any hematotoxicity.","['Gumireddy, Kiranmai', 'Baker, Stacey J', 'Cosenza, Stephen C', 'John, Premila', 'Kang, Anthony D', 'Robell, Kimberly A', 'Reddy, M V Ramana', 'Reddy, E Premkumar']","['Gumireddy K', 'Baker SJ', 'Cosenza SC', 'John P', 'Kang AD', 'Robell KA', 'Reddy MV', 'Reddy EP']","['The Fels Institute for Cancer Research and Molecular Biology, Temple University School of Medicine, 3307 North Broad Street, Philadelphia, PA 19140, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20050127,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Benzene Derivatives)', '0 (ON012380)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*metabolism/therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Benzene Derivatives/chemistry/*metabolism/therapeutic use', 'Cell Death', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Molecular Structure', 'Mutation', 'Piperazines/chemistry/*metabolism/therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/chemistry/*metabolism/therapeutic use', 'Recombinant Proteins/genetics/metabolism']",2005/01/29 09:00,2005/04/23 09:00,['2005/01/29 09:00'],"['2005/01/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/23 09:00 [medline]', '2005/01/29 09:00 [entrez]']","['0408283102 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.0408283102 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2005 Feb 8;102(6):1992-7. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0408283102.

Using an embryonic stem (ES) cell line in which lacZ cDNA has been targeted to the Scl locus, we show that most of the BL-CFCs are detected in the SCL/lacZ- population, indicating that this progenitor does not express Scl. In the blast colony assay, Scl-/- cells initiate colony growth but are unable to generate endothelial and hematopoietic progeny and thus form colonies consisting of vascular smooth muscle cells only. The capacity to give rise to blast colonies can be rescued by retroviral transduction of a wild-type Scl gene into Scl-/- FLK-1+ cells, suggesting that the BL-CFC is generated in this population. Finally, we show that Scl-/- endothelial cells display a growth deficiency in monolayer cultures that can be partially overcome by maintaining this population as 3-dimensional aggregates indicating that specific cellular interactions are required for maintenance of the Scl-/- endothelial lineage in vitro.","[""D'Souza, Sunita L"", 'Elefanty, Andrew G', 'Keller, Gordon']","[""D'Souza SL"", 'Elefanty AG', 'Keller G']","['Department of Gene and Cell Medicine, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, NY 10029, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",20050127,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Tal1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Stem Cells/*cytology/*metabolism', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2/metabolism']",2005/01/29 09:00,2005/06/09 09:00,['2005/01/29 09:00'],"['2005/01/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/09 09:00 [medline]', '2005/01/29 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)45471-0 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2004-09-3611 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2005 May 15;105(10):3862-70. doi: 10.1182/blood-2004-09-3611.

In the present report, we examine the effect of an Src kinase inhibitor, SU6656, on thrombopoietin (TPO)-induced growth and differentiation. Remarkably, when SU6656 (2.5 microM) was added to a megakaryocytic cell line, UT-7/TPO, the cells ceased cell division but continued to accumulate DNA by endomitosis. During this interval, CD41 and CD61 expression on the cell surface increased. Similar effects on polyploidization and MK differentiation were seen with expanded primary MKs, bone marrow from 2 patients with myelodysplastic syndrome, and other cell lines with MK potential. Our data suggest that SU6656 might be useful as a differentiation-inducing agent for MKs and is an important tool for understanding the molecular basis of MK endomitosis.","['Lannutti, Brian J', 'Blake, Noel', 'Gandhi, Manish J', 'Reems, Jo Anna', 'Drachman, Jonathan G']","['Lannutti BJ', 'Blake N', 'Gandhi MJ', 'Reems JA', 'Drachman JG']","['Puget Sound Blood Center, 921 Terry Ave, Seattle, WA 98104, USA. brianl@psbc.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",20050127,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Indoles)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (SU 6656)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow Cells/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Humans', 'Indoles/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia/*genetics/pathology', 'Megakaryocytes/drug effects/metabolism', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/pathology', '*Polyploidy', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Stem Cells/cytology/drug effects', 'Sulfonamides/*pharmacology', 'src-Family Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism']",2005/01/29 09:00,2005/06/09 09:00,['2005/01/29 09:00'],"['2005/01/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/09 09:00 [medline]', '2005/01/29 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)45473-4 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2004-10-3934 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2005 May 15;105(10):3875-8. doi: 10.1182/blood-2004-10-3934.

SCL is first expressed in mesodermal cells that give rise to embryonic blood cells, and continues to be expressed in fetal and adult hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). However, SCL is not required for the maintenance of established long-term repopulating (LTR) HSCs in the adult. The time point at which HSC development becomes SCL independent has not been defined. Tyrosine kinase with immunoglobulin and epidermal growth factor homology domains-2 (Tie2) expression appears in hemogenic and vasculogenic sites shortly after SCL. We therefore used the Tie2Cre mouse to inactivate SCL early during embryonic and fetal hematopoiesis. Tie2Cre completely inactivated SCL in yolk sac, the aortagonad-mesonephros (AGM) region, and fetal liver hematopoietic cells and circulating blood cells. However, the fetal liver was colonized by functional LTR-HSCs. Yet SCL remained crucial for proper differentiation of both primitive and definitive red cells and megakaryocytes. These results indicate that the SCL-dependent phase of HSC development ends before Tie2Cre-mediated gene ablation becomes effective.","['Schlaeger, Thorsten M', 'Mikkola, Hanna K A', 'Gekas, Christos', 'Helgadottir, Hildur B', 'Orkin, Stuart H']","['Schlaeger TM', 'Mikkola HK', 'Gekas C', 'Helgadottir HB', 'Orkin SH']","['Division of Hematology-Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, 44 Binney St, Boston, MA 02115, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",20050127,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Tal1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, TIE-2)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Cre recombinase)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Integrases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Fetus/cytology/embryology/metabolism', 'Gene Deletion', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/*metabolism', 'Integrases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptor, TIE-2/genetics/*metabolism', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Viral Proteins/genetics/*metabolism']",2005/01/29 09:00,2005/06/09 09:00,['2005/01/29 09:00'],"['2005/01/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/09 09:00 [medline]', '2005/01/29 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)45472-2 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2004-11-4467 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2005 May 15;105(10):3871-4. doi: 10.1182/blood-2004-11-4467.

Transformation of cytokine-dependent hematopoietic cells, such as Ba/F3 cells to autonomous growth and tumorigenicity equally results in selection for constitutive activation of STAT5. We compared STAT5 signaling between erythropoietin(Epo)-dependent cells and cells that were transformed by oncogenic activation of the erythropoietin receptor (EpoR) by coexpression of the gp55-P envelope protein of the spleen focus forming virus or by expression of the R129C constitutively active EpoR mutant. In transformed cells it was mainly STAT5B that was constitutively activated. In contrast, Epo stimulation activated both STAT5A and STAT5B. In transformed cells, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) showed STAT5 to be physically bound to promoters of STAT5 target genes, such as Bcl(XL), and to be able to promote transactivation of the Bcl(XL) promoter in a constitutive fashion. Sequencing of native sequences after ChIP with anti-STAT5 antibodies in Epo-dependent and -transformed cells indicated that in gp55-transformed cells, STAT5B bound in the chromatin not only to N3 high affinity, but also to low affinity N4 GAS sites. Transactivation for N3 GAS sites in luciferase reporters was specific to gp55 transformation. Because we also found preferential constitutive STAT5B activation after transformation of cells by a truncated form of the G-CSF-R that produces severe neutropenia (Kostmann syndrome) and favors leukemia in humans, we discuss the potential role of STAT5B in oncogenic transformation of hematopoietic cells.","['Moucadel, Virginie', 'Constantinescu, Stefan N']","['Moucadel V', 'Constantinescu SN']","['Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Brussels B-1200, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20050126,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Bcl2l1 protein, mouse)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Milk Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, Erythropoietin)', '0 (Receptors, Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT5A protein, human)', '0 (STAT5B protein, human)', '0 (Stat5a protein, mouse)', '0 (Stat5b protein, mouse)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '0 (glycoprotein gp55, Friend spleen focus-forming virus)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)']",IM,"['Active Transport, Cell Nucleus/physiology', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Erythropoietin/metabolism', 'Growth Substances/metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Ligands', 'Mice', 'Milk Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Neutropenia/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Cytokine/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Erythropoietin/metabolism', 'Receptors, Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'Trans-Activators/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'bcl-X Protein']",2005/01/29 09:00,2005/06/23 09:00,['2005/01/29 09:00'],"['2005/01/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/23 09:00 [medline]', '2005/01/29 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(19)60403-5 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M407326200 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2005 Apr 8;280(14):13364-73. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M407326200.

Accordingly, constitutive processing of p100, caused by the loss of its C-terminal processing inhibitory domain due to nfkappab2 gene rearrangements, is associated with the development of various lymphomas and leukemia. In contrast to the physiological processing of p100 triggered by NF-kappaB-inducing kinase (NIK) and its downstream kinase, IkappaB kinase alpha (IKKalpha), which requires the E3 ligase, beta-transducin repeat-containing protein (beta-TrCP), and occurs only in the cytoplasm, the constitutive processing of p100 is independent of beta-TrCP but rather is regulated by the nuclear shuttling of p100. Here, we show that constitutive processing of p100 also requires IKKalpha, but not IKKbeta (IkappaB kinase beta) or IKKgamma (IkappaB kinase gamma). It seems that NIK is also dispensable for this pathogenic processing of p100. These results demonstrate a general role of IKKalpha in p100 processing under both physiological and pathogenic conditions. Additionally, we find that IKKalpha is not required for the nuclear translocation of p100. Thus, these results also indicate that p100 nuclear translocation is not sufficient for the constitutive processing of p100.","['Qing, Guoliang', 'Xiao, Gutian']","['Qing G', 'Xiao G']","['Department of Cell Biology and Neuroscience, Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, 604 Allison Rd., Piscataway, New Jersey 08854, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20050127,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (NF-kappa B p52 Subunit)', '452VLY9402 (Serine)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (CHUK protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (Chuk protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (I-kappa B Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (IKBKB protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (IKBKE protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (Ikbkb protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (Ikbke protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Active Transport, Cell Nucleus', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism', 'Fibroblasts/metabolism', 'Genes, Dominant', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'I-kappa B Kinase', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'NF-kappa B p52 Subunit', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism/*physiology', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Serine/chemistry', 'Transfection']",2005/01/29 09:00,2005/04/26 09:00,['2005/01/29 09:00'],"['2005/01/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/26 09:00 [medline]', '2005/01/29 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(19)30363-1 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.C400502200 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2005 Mar 18;280(11):9765-8. doi: 10.1074/jbc.C400502200.

To understand the mechanisms underlying transcriptional regulation by Tal1/SCL, we combined an in vitro DNA binding strategy and an in vivo chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis to search for Tal1/SCL target regions in K562 erythroleukemia cells. A 0.4-kb genomic DNA clone containing two Tal1/SCL binding E-boxes and GATA- and SATB1-binding motifs (EEGS) was identified that localized to the pericentromeric region with high homology to satellite 2 DNA. Pericentric DNA is related to heterochromatin and gene inactivation. We found that Tal1/SCL could complex with the histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9)-specific methyltransferase Suv39H1. Binding of Tal1/SCL to EEGS chromatin correlated with hypermethylation of H3K9 and the association of heterochromatin protein HP1 to this region. In Rep4 reporter gene assays, EEGS affected repression in a manner dependent on the expression level of Tal1/SCL that was accompanied by increased H3K9 methylation in chromatin associated with EEGS and a linked promoter. A specific histone deacetylase inhibitor, trichostatin A, relieved Tal1/SCL-mediated repression by EEGS. In addition, SATB1 bound EEGS chromatin and promoted Tal1/SCL EEGS-dependent repression. We expand the list of potential interacting partners for Tal1/SCL by demonstrating direct associations of Tal1/SCL with SATB1 and with Suv39H1. These results reveal a novel mechanism of action for Tal1/SCL and implicate heterochromatin-like silencing via a cis-acting binding motif for transcriptional repression.","['Wen, Jie', 'Huang, Suming', 'Pack, Svetlana D', 'Yu, Xiaobing', 'Brandt, Stephen J', 'Noguchi, Constance Tom']","['Wen J', 'Huang S', 'Pack SD', 'Yu X', 'Brandt SJ', 'Noguchi CT']","['Molecular Medicine Branch, NIDDK, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20050127,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (Chromatin)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Heterochromatin)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '135471-20-4 (TAL1 protein, human)', '3X2S926L3Z (trichostatin A)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Motifs', 'Base Sequence', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Chromatin/metabolism', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'Chromosomes/metabolism', 'DNA/*metabolism', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Primers/chemistry', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Genes, Reporter', 'HeLa Cells', 'Heterochromatin/metabolism', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/pharmacology', 'Image Processing, Computer-Assisted', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukocytes/metabolism', 'Male', 'Models, Genetic', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Plasmids/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'Transcription Factors/chemistry/*metabolism', '*Transcription, Genetic']",2005/01/29 09:00,2005/05/14 09:00,['2005/01/29 09:00'],"['2005/01/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/05/14 09:00 [medline]', '2005/01/29 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(19)60630-7 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M412721200 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2005 Apr 1;280(13):12956-66. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M412721200.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were collected from 23 patients who received allogeneic stem cell transplantation, from before the preconditioning regimen to 56 days after transplantation. The number of interleukin-4 (IL-4), interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha)-secreting cells were measured by ELISPOT assay. For IL-4 and IFN-gamma, in vitro stimulation with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and phytohemagglutinin was performed. RESULTS: The frequency of IL-4-secreting cells was significantly higher in five patients receiving peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) than that in 18 patients who received bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Based on IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha release, there was a trend toward a decrease in the number of cytokine-secreting cells in PBSCT compared with BMT. Furthermore, patients who did not develop acute graft-vs-host disease (GVHD, n=5) showed a significantly higher number of IL-4-secreting cells compared with those who developed acute GVHD (n=18). Both IFN-gamma-secreting cells and TNF-alpha-secreting cells showed a trend to increase in number in patients with acute GVHD. In patients who received reduced-intensity stem cell transplantation (n=7) compared with conventional stem cell transplantation (n=16), there was a large number of cytokine-secreting cells detected by IL-4 and IFN-gamma release. CONCLUSIONS: These results are consistent with the hypothesis that IL-4-producing cells inhibit the development of acute GVHD. In addition, the increased percentage of IL-4-secreting cells may be responsible for the unexpected low incidence of acute GVHD in PBSCT, despite the presence of large numbers of mature T cells in the donor infusion.","['Takabayashi, Maki', 'Kanamori, Heiwa', 'Takasaki, Hirotaka', 'Yamaji, Satoshi', 'Koharazawa, Hideyuki', 'Taguchi, Jun', 'Tomita, Naoto', 'Fujimaki, Katsumichi', 'Fujisawa, Shin', 'Maruta, Atsuo', 'Ishigatsubo, Yoshiaki']","['Takabayashi M', 'Kanamori H', 'Takasaki H', 'Yamaji S', 'Koharazawa H', 'Taguchi J', 'Tomita N', 'Fujimaki K', 'Fujisawa S', 'Maruta A', 'Ishigatsubo Y']","['Department of Internal Medicine and Clinical Immunology, Yokohama City University, Graduate School of Medicine, Yokohama, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*immunology', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/immunology/*prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/analysis', 'Interleukin-4/analysis/*metabolism', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Homologous/immunology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/analysis']",2005/01/29 09:00,2005/04/12 09:00,['2005/01/29 09:00'],"['2004/07/12 00:00 [received]', '2004/10/07 00:00 [revised]', '2004/10/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/01/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/12 09:00 [medline]', '2005/01/29 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-472X(04)00358-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2004.10.009 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2005 Feb;33(2):251-7. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2004.10.009.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A critical question is whether memory T cells resident in bone marrow (BM) of patients with hematological malignancies are resistant to either pretransplant chemotherapy or ex vivo pharmacological purging. PATIENTS AND METHODS: To address these issues, we evaluated the frequency of tetanus-toxoid (TT)-specific proliferating T-cell precursors (TT-PTCp) in BM and peripheral blood (PB) of eight patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) given A-BMT after in vitro purging of BM with mafosfamide. Patients were studied at the time of BM harvesting and five of them also after A-BMT. RESULTS: The range of TT-PTCp frequencies found after A-BMT were comparable with those observed in PB and in BM at the time of harvesting and did not differ significantly from those of eight age-matched healthy subjects who donated BM for a human leukocyte antigen-identical sibling. TT-PTCp frequencies in BM, studied before and after ex vivo purging, appeared not to be affected by incubation with mafosfamide. We also compared the T-cell receptor (TCR)-Vbeta-repertoire usage of TT-specific T-cell lines (TT-TCL) in BM of patients at the time of harvesting and in their PB 2 months after transplantation. The same TCR-clonotypes were detected in TT-TCL at time of harvesting and after A-BMT. CONCLUSION: These data indicate that BM-resident memory T cells of patients with AML are resistant to both pretransplant chemotherapy and ex vivo pharmacological purging and may contribute to immune reconstitution after A-BMT.","['Casorati, Giulia', 'Locatelli, Franco', 'Pagani, Sara', 'Garavaglia, Claudio', 'Montini, Enrica', 'Lisini, Daniela', 'Turin, Ilaria', 'Rossi, Francesca', 'Dellabona, Paolo', 'Maccario, Rita', 'Montagna, Daniela']","['Casorati G', 'Locatelli F', 'Pagani S', 'Garavaglia C', 'Montini E', 'Lisini D', 'Turin I', 'Rossi F', 'Dellabona P', 'Maccario R', 'Montagna D']","['Experimental Immunology Unit, Cancer Immunotherapy and Gene Therapy Program, DIBIT, H.

Ligation of the leukemia-associated antigen CD33 by anti-CD33 monoclonal antibody (mAb) also results in signaling events that induce a downregulation of cell growth. We examined the possibility that anti-CD33 mAb and CA might cooperate in mediation of growth inhibition in primary AML samples and AML cell lines. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We investigated two AML cells lines and 14 primary AML samples for their proliferative response ((3)H-thymidine incorporation), colony formation, and biochemical (Western blot analysis) to anti-CD33 mAb treatment combined with chemotherapy agents. RESULTS: CD33 ligation induced a significant increase in ara-C- or IDA- but not VP-16-or Bryostatin-mediated inhibition of proliferation and colony formation. Ara-C and IDA induced SHP-1 and SHP-2 protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTPs) phosphorylation and Lyn/SHP-1 complex formation, while VP-16 and Bryostatin did not. CD33 ligation, however, mediated phosphorylation of these PTPs and Syk/SHP-1 complex formations. Combined treatment of AML cells by ara-C or IDA with anti-CD33 mAb resulted in higher levels of SHP-1 phosphorylation. Reduction in SHP-1 by short interfering RNA abrogated these effects. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that combined incubation of leukemia cells with anti-CD33 mAb and ara-C or IDA, but not VP-16 or Bryostatin, independently triggers similar events in the downstream signaling cascade, and therefore leads to additive antiproliferative effects and enhanced cytotoxicity.","['Balaian, Larisa', 'Ball, Edward D']","['Balaian L', 'Ball ED']","['Department of Medicine and Moores UCSD Cancer Center, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, Calif, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (CD33 protein, human)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/*pharmacology', 'Antigens, CD/*immunology', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/*immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/*drug effects', 'Cytarabine/*toxicity', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/*toxicity', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/*physiology']",2005/01/29 09:00,2005/04/12 09:00,['2005/01/29 09:00'],"['2004/07/02 00:00 [received]', '2004/10/28 00:00 [revised]', '2004/11/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/01/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/12 09:00 [medline]', '2005/01/29 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-472X(04)00402-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2004.11.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2005 Feb;33(2):199-211. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2004.11.004.,,,,['R0131888/PHS HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

ETO and MTG16 are both part of fusion proteins resulting from chromosomal translocations associated with acute myeloid leukemia. Expression of these chimeras results in a differentiation block that contributes to the onset of leukemia. In order to elucidate the relation between the ETO homologues and hematopoietic differentiation, we determined the expression of the homologues during differentiation of leukemic and normal hematopoietic cells. Our results showed MTGR1 and MTG16 to be ubiquitously expressed in leukemic cell lines, whereas expression of ETO was observed only in an erythroleukemic cell line. The MTGR1 and MTG16 proteins decreased during all trans-retinoic acid-, but not vitamin D(3)-induced differentiation of leukemic cells. The reduction seemed to reflect a decrease in transcript levels as well as in protein stability. MTGR1 transcripts were ubiquitously expressed in human bone marrow cells. The MTG16 transcripts of CD34(+) progenitor cells were rapidly downregulated by cytokine-induced differentiation into myeloid or erythroid lineages. ETO transcripts, present at very low abundance in CD34(+) progenitor cells, were transiently upregulated during erythroid differentiation. In conclusion, the differential expression of the ETO homologues suggests that they may have a potential role in hematopoietic differentiation.","['Lindberg, Sofia Rondin', 'Olsson, Andre', 'Persson, Ann-Maj', 'Olsson, Inge']","['Lindberg SR', 'Olsson A', 'Persson AM', 'Olsson I']","['Department of Hematology, University of Lund, Lund, Sweden.

Gene transcription plays a critical role in hematopoietic differentiation. However, there is no single transcription factor that is expressed exclusively by myeloid cells and that, alone, acts as a ""master"" regulator of myeloid fate choice. Rather, myeloid gene expression is controlled by the combinatorial effects of several key transcription factors. Hematopoiesis has traditionally been viewed as linear and hierarchical, but there is increasing evidence of plasticity during blood cell development. Transcription factors strongly influence cellular lineage during hematopoiesis and expression of some transcription factors can alter the fate of developing hematopoietic progenitor cells. PU.1 and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha (C/EBPalpha) regulate expression of numerous myeloid genes, and gene disruption studies have shown that they play essential, nonredundant roles in myeloid cell development. They function in cooperation with other transcription factors, co-activators, and co-repressors to regulate genes in the context of chromatin. Because of their essential roles in regulating myeloid genes and in myeloid cell development, it has been hypothesized that abnormal expression of PU.1 and C/EBPalpha would contribute to aberrant myeloid differentiation, i.e. acute leukemia. Such a direct link has been elusive until recently. However, there is now persuasive evidence that mutations in both PU.1 and C/EBPalpha contribute directly to development of acute myelogenous leukemia. Thus, normal myeloid development and acute leukemia are now understood to represent opposite sides of the same hematopoietic coin.","['Rosmarin, Alan G', 'Yang, Zhongfa', 'Resendes, Karen K']","['Rosmarin AG', 'Yang Z', 'Resendes KK']","['Department of Medicine, Brown Medical School, Providence, RI, USA.

Variant translocations leading to juxtaposing of the BCL2 with either the IGK or IGL gene have been recognized in B-cell malignant lymphoma, although they are rare. We identified seven lymphoma cases that had variant translocations. Three cases had simple translocations involving two chromosomal regions: t(18;22)(q21;q11.2) in two cases and t(2;18)(p11.2;q21) in the third case. Complex translocations affecting more than two chromosomes were seen in the remaining four cases. Fluorescence in situ hybridization using the LSI IGH/BCL2 DNA probes revealed rearrangements of the BCL2 gene locus in all cases. In addition, expression of BCL2 protein was seen in all cases; only five of the seven cases expressed BCL6 protein. Morphologically, the lymphomas were categorized as B-cell follicular lymphoma in six cases and in the seventh case as diffuse large cell lymphoma (Richter syndrome) transformed from preexisting chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). In case 2, the variant t(18;22) was seen as a secondary aberration evolving from a trisomy 12 clone.

In this study we investigated the mechanism by which Ara-C induces K562 cells to differentiate. We first observed that Ara-C-induced differentiation of these cells is completely inhibited by the radiosensitizing agent caffeine, an inhibitor of ATM and ATR protein kinases. We next found that Ara-C activates Chk1 and Chk2 in the cells, and that the activation of Chk1, but not of Chk2, was almost completely inhibited by caffeine. Proteasome-mediated degradation of Cdc25A and phosphorylation of Cdc25C were induced by Ara-C treatment, presumably due to the activation of Chk2 and Chk1, respectively. To directly observe the effects of checkpoint kinase activation in Ara-C-induced differentiation, we suppressed Chk1 or Chk2 with the Chk1-specific inhibitor Go6976, by generating cell lines stably over-expressing dominant-negative forms of Chk2, or by siRNA-mediated knock-down of the Chk1 or the Chk2 gene. The results suggest that Ara-C-induced erythroid differentiation of K562 cells depends on both Chk1 and Chk2 pathways.","['Takagaki, Kazuchika', 'Katsuma, Susumu', 'Kaminishi, Yoshinori', 'Horio, Tatsuya', 'Tanaka, Teruo', 'Ohgi, Tadaaki', 'Yano, Junichi']","['Takagaki K', 'Katsuma S', 'Kaminishi Y', 'Horio T', 'Tanaka T', 'Ohgi T', 'Yano J']","['Research Laboratories, Nippon Shinyaku Co.

The BRAF gene, encoding a RAF family member in the downstream pathway of RAS, is somatically mutated in a number of human cancers, raising the possibility that other RAF family members might be mutated in human cancers. In this study we analyzed the genomic DNAs for the detection of somatic mutations of the ARAF gene in 60 human cancer cell lines and 323 primary human cancer tissues, including colorectal carcinomas, gastric carcinomas, ovarian tumors and acute leukemias. The MOLT-4 leukemia cell line was found to harbor an ARAF gene mutation resulting in an amino acid substitution (A451T) at the activation segment in the kinase domain of ARAF. In the cancer tissues we could not detect any ARAF gene mutation. Our data indicate that, in contrast to the BRAF gene, the ARAF gene is rarely mutated in human cancers, and suggest that alterations of the RAS pathway by ARAF gene mutation may not play an important role in the pathogenesis of human cancers.","['Lee, Jong Woo', 'Soung, Young Hwa', 'Kim, Su Young', 'Park, Won Sang', 'Nam, Suk Woo', 'Min, Woo Sung', 'Kim, Sang Ho', 'Lee, Jung Young', 'Yoo, Nam Jin', 'Lee, Sug Hyung']","['Lee JW', 'Soung YH', 'Kim SY', 'Park WS', 'Nam SW', 'Min WS', 'Kim SH', 'Lee JY', 'Yoo NJ', 'Lee SH']","['Department of Pathology, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Denmark,APMIS,"APMIS : acta pathologica, microbiologica, et immunologica Scandinavica",8803400,"['9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (raf Kinases)']",IM,"['*DNA', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Humans', '*Mutation', 'Neoplasms/*genetics/metabolism', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational', 'raf Kinases/*genetics/metabolism']",2005/01/29 09:00,2005/03/16 09:00,['2005/01/29 09:00'],"['2005/01/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/16 09:00 [medline]', '2005/01/29 09:00 [entrez]']","['APMapm1130108 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-0463.2005.apm1130108.x [doi]']",ppublish,APMIS. 2005 Jan;113(1):54-7. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0463.2005.apm1130108.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Similarly, celery is a common allergenic food in Western Europe. Severe allergic reactions to both foods are common. Unexpected allergic reactions can occur after the consumption of celery- and peanut-free foods as a result of inadvertent cross-contaminations during manufacturing. Therefore, in cooperation with a flavor manufacturer, we monitored the cleaning process of slurry preparation equipment with regard to contaminations of follow-up products with celery and peanut compounds. Washing water samples taken after different cleaning steps and follow-up products were analyzed for the presence of celery and peanut traces with a celery-specific real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and a peanut-specific sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). PCR and ELISA were compared with a nonspecific protein assay to evaluate whether the detection of protein traces can be a fast and cost-effective method for monitoring the effectiveness of wet cleaning procedures. Additionally, the allergenic potential of the celery and peanut mush, which were used as source material, were measured by a mediator release assay using a rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) cell line. In conclusion, the quantification of total protein in washing water was suitable for monitoring the cleaning process.

We prospectively monitored AML1-ETO rearrangement by real-time quantitative PCR (RQ-PCR) in 21 patients uniformly treated in our center. Blood (PB) and bone marrow (BM) samples were collected during and after therapy. At diagnosis, levels of AML1-ETO transcript showed large variations and there was a trend for a higher relapse rate in patients with high pretreatment expression levels (P=0.065). After induction therapy, absolute transcript levels (below 10(-3), compared to Kasumi cell line), or a greater than 3 log decrease by comparison to diagnosis levels, were significant predictors of the absence of relapse (P=0.02 and P=0.02, respectively). MRD levels after consolidation therapy were also significant indicators of relapse (P=10(-5)). Comparison of BM and PB samples showed similar sensitivity for detecting AML1-ETO transcript.

In CLL, high serum levels of VEGF are a feature of advanced disease, and we and others have previously shown that CLL cells produce and secrete this growth factor. Since CD154 stimulates VEGF production in other cell types, and VEGF is known to promote cell survival, we examined whether the cytoprotection of CLL cells by CD154 involves VEGF. We report for the first time that treatment of CLL cells with CD154 results in increased VEGF production and demonstrate involvement of NF-kappaB in this process. Moreover, we show that CD154-induced CLL-cell survival is reduced by anti-VEGF-neutralising antibody and by inhibiting VEGF receptor (VEGFR) signalling with SU5416. However, addition of exogenous VEGF alone or blocking secreted autocrine VEGF had little or no effect on CLL-cell survival. We therefore conclude that CLL-cell cytoprotection in the presence of CD154 requires combined signalling by both CD40 and VEGFR.

Asparagine synthetase (ASY), which is a housekeeping gene, is repressed and the promoting region of the gene is highly methylated. We now demonstrate in these cells multiple levels in control of the expression of this gene, in a system of cocultivation with macrophages and other cell types. In this system, mediated by cell-to-cell contact, ASY becomes expressed by the leukemic cells and they become prototrophic. Demethylation of ASY occurs; it follows expression and is permanent over multiple cell generations, but the cells return to auxotrophy with rapid repression of ASY on removal from cell contact. With ASY expression, the associated histone H3 at lysine position 9 (H3K9) becomes acetylated and H3K4, methylated. In contrast to other systems, H3K9 methylation does not characterize the repressed state. The changes leading from repression to induction of ASY and demethylation parallel the physiological changes specific to functional maturation of normal lymphoid precursors. The lability of expression of ASY has potential significance in determining the sensitivity of leukemic cells to L-asparaginase.","['Ding, Y', 'Li, Z', 'Broome, J D']","['Ding Y', 'Li Z', 'Broome JD']","['Department of Pathology, North Shore University Hospital, Manhasset, NY 11030, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Histones)', '7006-34-0 (Asparagine)', 'EC 6.3.1.1 (Aspartate-Ammonia Ligase)']",IM,"['Acetylation', 'Animals', 'Asparagine/metabolism', 'Aspartate-Ammonia Ligase/biosynthesis/*genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Division/physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Enzyme Induction/genetics', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Gene Silencing', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*enzymology/*genetics', 'Macrophages/cytology', 'Methylation', 'Mice', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic']",2005/01/28 09:00,2005/03/30 09:00,['2005/01/28 09:00'],"['2005/01/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/30 09:00 [medline]', '2005/01/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['2403639 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2403639 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2005 Mar;19(3):420-6. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403639.,,,,,,['Leukemia. 2005 Jun;19(6):1108'],,,,,,,,,,,

A total of 38 cases (20%) harbored RAS mutations. Among the 142 B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cases, RAS mutations were more common among Hispanic children (P=0.11) or children born to mothers <30 years (P=0.007). Those with hyperdiploidy at diagnosis (>50 chromosomes) had the highest rates of RAS mutation (P=0.02). A multivariable model confirmed the significant associations between RAS mutation and both maternal age and hyperdiploidy. Interestingly, smoking of the father in the 3 months prior to pregnancy was reported less frequently among hyperdiploid leukemia patients than among those without hyperdiploidy (P=0.02). The data suggest that RAS and high hyperdiploidy may be cooperative genetic events to produce the leukemia subtype; and furthermore, that maternal age and paternal preconception smoking or other factors associated with these parameters are critical in the etiology of subtypes of childhood leukemia.","['Wiemels, J L', 'Zhang, Y', 'Chang, J', 'Zheng, S', 'Metayer, C', 'Zhang, L', 'Smith, M T', 'Ma, X', 'Selvin, S', 'Buffler, P A', 'Wiencke, J K']","['Wiemels JL', 'Zhang Y', 'Chang J', 'Zheng S', 'Metayer C', 'Zhang L', 'Smith MT', 'Ma X', 'Selvin S', 'Buffler PA', 'Wiencke JK']","['Laboratory for Molecular Epidemiology, Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, and UCSF Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of California, San Francisco, CA 94143, USA. wiemels@itsa.ucsf.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Bone Marrow Examination', 'California/epidemiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Comorbidity', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Female', 'Genes, ras/*genetics', 'Hispanic or Latino/genetics', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Maternal Exposure', '*Mutation', 'Paternal Exposure', '*Polyploidy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/epidemiology/*genetics', 'Smoking/epidemiology', 'Whites/genetics']",2005/01/28 09:00,2005/03/30 09:00,['2005/01/28 09:00'],"['2005/01/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/30 09:00 [medline]', '2005/01/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['2403641 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2403641 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2005 Mar;19(3):415-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403641.,,,,"['PS42 ES04705/PS/NCHHSTP CDC HHS/United States', 'R01 CA89032/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 ES09137/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

P210- and control-transduced (GFP+) human hematopoietic cells were produced in the bone marrow of the mice at similar levels until termination of the experiments 5-6 months later.

These translocations involve the TCRalphadelta gene (14q11), the TCRbeta gene (7q34) and to a lesser extent the TCRgamma gene at chromosomal band 7p14 and juxtapose T-cell oncogenes next to TCR regulatory sequences leading to deregulated expression of those oncogenes. Here, we describe a new recurrent chromosomal inversion of chromosome 7, inv(7)(p15q34), in a subset of patients with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia characterized by CD2 negative and CD4 positive, CD8 negative blasts. This rearrangement juxtaposes the distal part of the HOXA gene cluster on 7p15 to the TCRbeta locus on 7q34. Real time quantitative PCR analysis for all HOXA genes revealed high levels of HOXA10 and HOXA11 expression in all inv(7) positive cases. This is the first report of a recurrent chromosome rearrangement targeting the HOXA gene cluster in T-cell malignancies resulting in deregulated HOXA gene expression (particularly HOXA10 and HOXA11) and is in keeping with a previous report suggesting HOXA deregulation in MLL-rearranged T- and B cell lymphoblastic leukemia as the key factor in leukaemic transformation.

Recently, several works have reported the presence of CEBPA-acquired mutations in hematological malignancies. In this work, we analyzed characteristics of mutations and their correlation with disease characteristics described in previous studies. In the 1175 patients reported, 146 CEBPA mutations were identified in 96 patients. Mutations were found in the whole gene sequence, but cluster regions were clearly identified. Furthermore, two categories of mutations were reported: out-of-frame ins/del often in the N-terminal region, and in-frame ins/del often in the C-terminal region. CEBPA mutations were reported exclusively in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (according to WHO classification criteria) and mutated patients preferentially belonged to M1, M2 and M4 FAB subtypes. All but one case belonged to the 'intermediate' prognostic subgroup of MRC classification. In the absence of poor prognostic factors, patients with CEBPA mutation had favorable outcome, very similar to that of the t(8;21), inv(16), t(15;17) subgroup. Systematic analysis of CEBPA mutations, in addition to that of alterations in master genes of hematopoiesis, may be useful to assess the prognosis of AML particularly in patients belonging to the 'intermediate' prognostic subgroup.","['Leroy, H', 'Roumier, C', 'Huyghe, P', 'Biggio, V', 'Fenaux, P', 'Preudhomme, C']","['Leroy H', 'Roumier C', 'Huyghe P', 'Biggio V', 'Fenaux P', 'Preudhomme C']","[""Laboratoire d'Hematologie A, CHRU Lille, U524 INSERM Lille, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha)'],IM,"['CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha/*genetics/physiology', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Point Mutation/*genetics', 'Prognosis']",2005/01/28 09:00,2005/03/30 09:00,['2005/01/28 09:00'],"['2005/01/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/30 09:00 [medline]', '2005/01/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['2403614 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2403614 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2005 Mar;19(3):329-34. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403614.,39,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We therefore sought to measure expression of the major telomerase components (hTR and hTERT) in CD34+ cells from CML patients and normal controls, to determine if their altered expression may contribute to telomere attrition in vivo. High-purity (median 94.1%) BCR-ABL+ CD34+ cells from CML (n=16) and non-CML (n=14) patients were used. CML samples had a small increase in telomerase activity (TA) compared to normal samples (approximately 1.5-fold, P=0.004), which was inversely correlated with the percentage of G0 cells (P=0.02) suggesting TA may not be elevated on a cell-to-cell basis in CML. Consistent with this, hTERT mRNA expression was not significantly elevated; however, altered mRNA splicing appeared to play a significant role in determining overall full length, functional hTERT levels. Interestingly, Q-RT-PCR for hTR demonstrated a mean five-fold reduction in levels in the chronic phase (CP) CML samples (P=0.002), raising the possibility that telomere homeostasis is disrupted in CML. In summary, the molecular events regulating telomerase gene expression and telomere maintenance during the CP of CML may influence the disease progression observed in these patients.","['Drummond, M W', 'Hoare, S F', 'Monaghan, A', 'Graham, S M', 'Alcorn, M J', 'Keith, W N', 'Holyoake, T L']","['Drummond MW', 'Hoare SF', 'Monaghan A', 'Graham SM', 'Alcorn MJ', 'Keith WN', 'Holyoake TL']","['Section of Experimental Haematology, Division of Cancer Sciences and Molecular Pathology, University of Glasgow, 10 Alexandra Parade, Glasgow, UK. mwd3z@clinmed.gla.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)']",IM,"['Alternative Splicing/genetics', 'Antigens, CD34/analysis/biosynthesis', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/blood/*genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/cytology/*enzymology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Telomerase/*genetics/metabolism']",2005/01/28 09:00,2005/03/30 09:00,['2005/01/28 09:00'],"['2005/01/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/30 09:00 [medline]', '2005/01/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['2403616 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2403616 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2005 Mar;19(3):381-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403616.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

WEBs induced apoptosis also in the two ATRA-resistant NB4-007-6 and NB4-MR4 cell lines and in blasts from patients with t(15;17) APL. Moreover, subapoptotic WEBs acted synergistically with low-dose (0.025-0.05 microM) ATRA; this allowed to increase ATRA differentiation potential up to 40-fold and to improve both number and intensity of NBT-positive NB4 cells at definitely higher levels than with 1 muM ATRA alone. The powerful antiproliferative-apoptotic activities of WEBs in vitro on ATRA-sensitive, ATRA-resistant APL cells and blasts from patients with APL as well as drug capabilities to enhance ATRA differentiation potential suggested that these agents also due to their recognized tolerability in vivo might improve, alone or in combination, clinical treatment of APL.","['Laurenzana, A', 'Cellai, C', 'Vannucchi, A M', 'Pancrazzi, A', 'Romanelli, M N', 'Paoletti, F']","['Laurenzana A', 'Cellai C', 'Vannucchi AM', 'Pancrazzi A', 'Romanelli MN', 'Paoletti F']","['Department of Experimental Pathology and Oncology, University of Florence, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Azepines)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Triazoles)', '105219-56-5 (WEB 2086)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'CKS724B66O (bepafant)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Azepines/*pharmacology', 'Caspases/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Triazoles/*pharmacology']",2005/01/28 09:00,2005/03/30 09:00,['2005/01/28 09:00'],"['2005/01/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/30 09:00 [medline]', '2005/01/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['2403618 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2403618 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2005 Mar;19(3):390-5. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403618.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We evaluated a new method for chimerism detection, based on the quantitative real-time PCR (qrt-PCR) amplification of null alleles or insertion/deletion polymorphisms (indels). All qrt-PCR assays with null alleles and indels attained a sensitivity of at least 10(-4), as well as good intra- and interassay concordance, and a high accuracy in experiments with cell mixtures. Informativeness was found in 80.3% of the 61 donor/recipient pairs tested.

Paradoxically, along with these antiapoptotic genes CLL cells had high-level expression of proapoptotic BH3-only proteins Bmf and Noxa. Treatment of CLL cells with fludarabine induced only the proapoptotic genes Bax and Puma in a p53-dependent manner. Interestingly, the degree of Puma induction was more pronounced in cells with mutated IgVH genes. Thus, disturbed apoptosis in CLL is the net result of both protective and sensitizing aberrations. This delicate balance can be tipped via induction of Puma in a p53-dependent matter, the level of which may vary between groups of patients with a different tendency for disease progression.","['Mackus, W J M', 'Kater, A P', 'Grummels, A', 'Evers, L M', 'Hooijbrink, B', 'Kramer, M H H', 'Castro, J E', 'Kipps, T J', 'van Lier, R A W', 'van Oers, M H J', 'Eldering, E']","['Mackus WJ', 'Kater AP', 'Grummels A', 'Evers LM', 'Hooijbrink B', 'Kramer MH', 'Castro JE', 'Kipps TJ', 'van Lier RA', 'van Oers MH', 'Eldering E']","['Department of Hematology, Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BBC3 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '106XV160TZ (Vidarabine Phosphate)', '1X9VK9O1SC (fludarabine phosphate)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics/physiology', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Gene Expression Profiling/methods', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/drug effects/genetics/*metabolism', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects', 'Vidarabine Phosphate/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology']",2005/01/28 09:00,2005/03/30 09:00,['2005/01/28 09:00'],"['2005/01/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/30 09:00 [medline]', '2005/01/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['2403623 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2403623 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2005 Mar;19(3):427-34. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403623.,,,,['R37 CA49870/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hierarchical clustering analysis segregated APL, AML with inv(16), monocytic leukemias and the remaining AML into separate groups. A set of only 21 genes was able to assign AML to one of these three classes: APL, inv(16) and other AML subtype without a specific translocation. Quantitative RT-PCR performed for 18 out of these predictor genes confirmed microarray results. APL expressed high levels of FGF13 and FGFR1 as well as two potent angiogenic factors, HGF and VEGF. AML with inv(16) showed an upregulation of MYH11 and a downregulation of a gene encoding a core-binding factor protein, RUNX3. Genes involved in cell adhesion represented the most altered functional category in monocytic leukemias. Two major groups emerged from the remaining 22 AML: cluster A with 10 samples and cluster B with 12. All the eight leukemias that were either refractory to treatment or that relapsed afterwards were assigned to cluster B.

We hypothesized that p210(BCR/ABL) suppresses expression of genes which may explain at least some of the pathogenetic features of CML. A subtractive cDNA library was created between BCR/ABL-enhanced-green-fluorescent-protein (GFP)-transduced umbilical cord blood (UCB) CD34+ cells and GFP-transduced UCB CD34+ cells to identify genes whose expression is downregulated by p210(BCR/ABL). At least 100 genes were identified. We have confirmed for eight of these genes that expression was suppressed by quantitative real-time-RT-PCR (Q-RT-PCR) of additional p210(BCR/ABL)-transduced CD34+ UCB cells as well as primary early chronic phase (CP) bone marrow (BM) CML CD34+ cells. Imatinib mesylate reversed downregulation of some genes, to approximately normal levels. Several of the genes are implicated in cell adhesion and motility, including L-selectin, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), and the chemokine receptor, CCR7, consistent with the known defect in adhesion and migration of CML cells. Compared with GFP UCB or normal (NL) BM CD34+ cells, p210 UCB and CML CD34+ cells migrated poorly towards the CCR7 ligands, CCL19 and CCL21, suggesting a possible role for CCR7 in the abnormal migratory behavior of CML CD34+ cells.","['Jongen-Lavrencic, M', 'Salesse, S', 'Delwel, R', 'Verfaillie, C M']","['Jongen-Lavrencic M', 'Salesse S', 'Delwel R', 'Verfaillie CM']","['Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota, Stem Cell Institute, Cancer Center, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (CCL19 protein, human)', '0 (CCL21 protein, human)', '0 (CCR7 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokine CCL19)', '0 (Chemokine CCL21)', '0 (Chemokines, CC)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, CCR7)', '0 (Receptors, Chemokine)', '126547-89-5 (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1)', '126880-86-2 (L-Selectin)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Cell Adhesion/genetics/physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Movement/genetics/*physiology', 'Chemokine CCL19', 'Chemokine CCL21', 'Chemokines, CC/genetics/*physiology', 'Down-Regulation', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/*physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1/genetics', 'K562 Cells', 'L-Selectin/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/pathology', 'Ligands', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Receptors, CCR7', 'Receptors, Chemokine/genetics/*physiology']",2005/01/28 09:00,2005/03/30 09:00,['2005/01/28 09:00'],"['2005/01/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/30 09:00 [medline]', '2005/01/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['2403626 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2403626 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2005 Mar;19(3):373-80. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403626.,,,,['R01 HL-49930-10/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

The initiation and execution of cell death, however, is far more complex and includes pathways like caspase-independent apoptosis or actively triggered necrosis. In this study, we investigated the mechanisms of cell death induced by arsenic trioxide (arsenite, As2O3), a clinically efficient agent in anticancer therapy. As2O3-induced cell death coincides with cytochrome c release, facilitates mitochondrial permeability transition and is sensitive to inhibition by Bcl-x(L), indicating that cell demise is regulated through the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway. Nevertheless, only little caspase-3 activation was observed and As2O3-induced cell death was only weakly obstructed by the broad spectrum caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk. Moreover, disruption of caspase-9 or -2 failed to decrease the amount of As2O3-mediated cell death. Interestingly, As2O3-induced cell death had a predominantly necrosis-like phenotype as assessed by Annexin-V/propidium iodide staining and LDH release. Finally, blocking glutathione synthetase by buthionine sulfoximine enhanced the As2O3-mediated necrosis-like cell death without increasing caspase-3 cleavage. As2O3 does, however, not directly inhibit caspases, but appears to interfere with caspase activation. Altogether, our data clearly delineate a mode of As2O3-triggered cell death that differs considerably from that induced by conventional anticancer drugs. These findings may explain the capability of As2O3 to efficiently kill even chemoresistant tumor cells with disturbed apoptosis signaling and caspase activation, a frequent finding in malignancy.","['Scholz, Christian', 'Wieder, Thomas', 'Starck, Lilian', 'Essmann, Frank', 'Schulze-Osthoff, Klaus', 'Dorken, Bernd', 'Daniel, Peter T']","['Scholz C', 'Wieder T', 'Starck L', 'Essmann F', 'Schulze-Osthoff K', 'Dorken B', 'Daniel PT']","['Department of Hematology, Oncology and Tumor Immunology, Charite, Campus Berlin-Buch, Robert-Rossle-Klinik, Humboldt Universitat, Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 2)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects/physiology', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Caspase 2', 'Caspase 9', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Cell Death/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Fibroblasts/drug effects/physiology', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/*ultrastructure', 'Necrosis', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'bcl-X Protein']",2005/01/28 09:00,2005/04/15 09:00,['2005/01/28 09:00'],"['2005/01/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/15 09:00 [medline]', '2005/01/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['1208233 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.onc.1208233 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2005 Mar 10;24(11):1904-13. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1208233.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To elucidate whether these mutations cause aberrant signal transduction in AML, we used gene expression profiling in a series of 110 newly diagnosed AML patients with normal karyotype. The different algorithms used for data analysis revealed highly concordant sets of genes, indicating that the identified gene signatures are specific for each analysed subgroup. Whereas samples with FLT3-ITD and FLT3-TKD could be separated with up to 100% accuracy, this did not apply for NRAS-PM and wild-type samples, suggesting that only FLT3-ITD and FLT3-TKD are associated with an apparent signature in AML. The set of discriminating genes included several known genes, which are involved in cell cycle control (CDC14A, WEE1), gene transcription (HOXB5, FOXA1), and signal transduction (SMG1). In conclusion, we showed that unique gene expression patterns can be correlated with FLT3-ITD and FLT3-TKD. This might lead to the identification of further pathogenetic relevant candidate genes particularly in AML with normal karyotype.","['Neben, Kai', 'Schnittger, Susanne', 'Brors, Benedikt', 'Tews, Bjorn', 'Kokocinski, Felix', 'Haferlach, Torsten', 'Muller, Jasmin', 'Hahn, Meinhard', 'Hiddemann, Wolfgang', 'Eils, Roland', 'Lichter, Peter', 'Schoch, Claudia']","['Neben K', 'Schnittger S', 'Brors B', 'Tews B', 'Kokocinski F', 'Haferlach T', 'Muller J', 'Hahn M', 'Hiddemann W', 'Eils R', 'Lichter P', 'Schoch C']","['Division of Molecular Genetics (B060), Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum, Im Neuenheimer Feld 280, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genes, ras/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', '*Mutation', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Probability', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*genetics', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3']",2005/01/28 09:00,2005/03/23 09:00,['2005/01/28 09:00'],"['2005/01/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/23 09:00 [medline]', '2005/01/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['1208344 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.onc.1208344 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2005 Feb 24;24(9):1580-8. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1208344.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have already shown that BTG1, considered as an antiproliferative protein, strongly stimulates myoblast differentiation. However, the mechanisms involved in this influence remained unknown. In cultured myoblasts, we found that BTG1 stimulates the transcriptional activity of nuclear receptors (T3 and all-trans retinoic acid receptors but not RXRalpha and PPARgamma), c-Jun and myogenic factors (CMD1, Myf5, myogenin). Immunoprecipitation experiments performed in cells or using in vitro-synthesized proteins and GST pull-down assays established that BTG1 directly interacts with T3 and all-trans retinoic acid receptors and with avian MyoD (CMD1). These interactions are mediated by the transactivation domain of each transcription factor and the A box and C-terminal part of BTG1. NCoR presence induces the ligand dependency of the interaction with nuclear receptors. Lastly, deletion of BTG1 interacting domains abrogates its ability to stimulate nuclear receptors and CMD1 activity, and its myogenic influence. In conclusion, BTG1 is a novel important coactivator involved in the regulation of myoblast differentiation. It not only stimulates the activity of myogenic factors, but also of nuclear receptors already known as positive myogenic regulators.","['Busson, Muriel', 'Carazo, Angel', 'Seyer, Pascal', 'Grandemange, Stephanie', 'Casas, Francois', 'Pessemesse, Laurence', 'Rouault, Jean-Pierre', 'Wrutniak-Cabello, Chantal', 'Cabello, Gerard']","['Busson M', 'Carazo A', 'Seyer P', 'Grandemange S', 'Casas F', 'Pessemesse L', 'Rouault JP', 'Wrutniak-Cabello C', 'Cabello G']","['UMR 866 Differenciation Cellulaire et Croissance, INRA, 2 place Viala, 34060 Montpellier Cedex 1, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun)', '0 (Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear)', '146835-72-5 (BTG1 protein, human)', '3X2S926L3Z (trichostatin A)', 'EC 2.1.1.319 (Protein-Arginine N-Methyltransferases)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/pharmacology', 'Myoblasts/*cytology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/chemistry/*physiology', 'Protein-Arginine N-Methyltransferases/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun/physiology', 'Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear/*physiology', 'Transcription, Genetic']",2005/01/28 09:00,2005/03/25 09:00,['2005/01/28 09:00'],"['2005/01/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/25 09:00 [medline]', '2005/01/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['1208373 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.onc.1208373 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2005 Mar 3;24(10):1698-710. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1208373.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) cell lines, KCL22 and K562, express exceptionally low levels of endogenous C/EBPs and provide a good model to test the effects of C/EBPs on myeloid differentiation. To explore the possibility that C/EBPdelta can promote differentiation in BCR-ABL-positive cells, we generated stable KCL22 and K562 clones that expressed an inducible C/EBPdelta gene. C/EBPdelta expression resulted in G0/G1 proliferative arrest and a moderate increase in apoptosis of the KCL22 and the K562 cells. Within 4 days of inducing expression of C/EBPdelta, myeloid differentiation of the CML blast cells occurred as shown by morphologic changes and induction of secondary granule-specific genes. We also showed that during granulocytic differentiation of KCL22 cells, the C/EBPdelta protein was detected in immunocomplexes with both Rb and E2F1. Furthermore, expression of C/EBPdelta was associated with downregulation of c-Myc and cyclin E and upregulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27(Kip1) in both the KCL22 and K562 cell lines. These results show that expression of C/EBPdelta in BCR-ABL-positive leukemic cells in blast crisis is sufficient for neutrophil differentiation and point to the therapeutic potential of ectopic induction of C/EBPdelta in the acute phase of CML.","['Gery, Sigal', 'Tanosaki, Sakae', 'Hofmann, Wolf-K', 'Koppel, Ahrin', 'Koeffler, H Phillip']","['Gery S', 'Tanosaki S', 'Hofmann WK', 'Koppel A', 'Koeffler HP']","['Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Division of Hematology/Oncology, UCLA School of Medicine, Los Angeles, CA 90048, USA. gerys@cshs.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins)', '0 (CEBPD protein, human)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '142662-43-9 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-delta)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-delta', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*analysis', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Growth Substances/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/pathology', 'Neutrophils/physiology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics']",2005/01/28 09:00,2005/03/23 09:00,['2005/01/28 09:00'],"['2005/01/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/23 09:00 [medline]', '2005/01/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['1208393 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.onc.1208393 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2005 Feb 24;24(9):1589-97. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1208393.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Dysregulation of normal epigenetic transcription occurs in abnormal physiological conditions, such as those seen in cancer cells and cells infected with parasites, making the mechanism underlying abnormal epigenetic transcription of great interest. Gene expression of human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is regulated by a viral transcriptional stimulator, Tax. We herein report a novel mechanism of transcription from the HTLV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) that is regulated by Tax. In this study, we determined that Tax is able to activate transcription from the LTR, even when it was heavily methylated. In addition, the methyl-CpG-binding domain 2 (MBD2) protein played an important role in Tax-mediated transcriptional activation. We demonstrated the importance of a physical interaction between Tax and MBD2 in enhancing the transcriptional activity of Tax against the methylated LTR. Furthermore, we identified the formation of a protein complex composed of MBD2 and Tax bound to the methylated LTR. We propose a new model of epigenetic regulation by MBD2 acting in concert with a virally encoded transactivator, Tax. Our observation provides insight into the epigenetic regulation of gene expression and the diverse mechanisms of transcriptional regulation using methylated promoters.","['Ego, Takeshi', 'Tanaka, Yuetsu', 'Shimotohno, Kunitada']","['Ego T', 'Tanaka Y', 'Shimotohno K']","['Department of Viral Oncology, Institute for Virus Research, Kyoto University, 53 Kawara-cho, Shogoin, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto 606-8507, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Dinucleoside Phosphates)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', ""2382-65-2 (cytidylyl-3'-5'-guanosine)""]",IM,"['Binding Sites', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Methylation', 'Dinucleoside Phosphates/*metabolism', 'Gene Products, tax/*metabolism', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kidney', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Terminal Repeat Sequences', 'Transfection']",2005/01/28 09:00,2005/04/15 09:00,['2005/01/28 09:00'],"['2005/01/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/15 09:00 [medline]', '2005/01/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['1208394 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.onc.1208394 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2005 Mar 10;24(11):1914-23. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1208394.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Erythropoietin or IL-3 significantly enhanced etoposide-induced activation-specific phosphorylation of Chk1, a checkpoint kinase that inhibits Cdc2 activation by Cdc25 phosphatases, and led to the inhibition of Cdc2 kinase activity with the persistent inhibitory phosphorylation on Tyr15. The inhibitory Cdc2 phosphorylation and G2/M block by etoposide were enhanced or inhibited by overexpression of Chk1 or by the specific Chk1 inhibitor SB218078, respectively. The G2/M arrest induced by etoposide was also enhanced or inhibited by expression of a constitutively activated or dominant-negative Akt mutant, respectively. Furthermore, SB216763 or LiCl, a specific inhibitor for the GSK3 kinase inhibited by Akt, enhanced the Chk1 phosphorylation and G2/M arrest by etoposide.

We therefore examined the expression of PI-9 and GrB mRNAs in eight patients after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation with GVHD (n = 4) or without chronic GVHD (n = 4). Expression of GrB mRNA was significantly increased in three patients with GVHD and one patient without GVHD. Surprisingly, PI-9 mRNA expression was decreased in the eight patients.

In this work, we evaluated the effects of DC treatment on the human leukemic cell line HL60. Human cells were separately treated in the presence of the cathode or the anode or without contact with the electrodes. In all systems, DC-treated cells presented an impaired ability to proliferate. Growth inhibition was dependent on the generation of soluble products of electrolysis. Cathodic treatment of HL60 cells predominantly induced lysis, whereas treatment without contact with electrodes did not induce alterations in cell viability. In contrast, cell stimulation by the anode resulted in irreversible membrane damage, as demonstrated by trypan blue and 7-aminoactinomycin staining. Analysis of these cells by transmission electron microscopy indicated that necrosis is a major mechanism inducing cell death. In addition, apoptotic-like cells were observed under light microscopy after anodic treatment. Accordingly, DNA from anodic-treated cells presented a typical pattern of apoptosis. Apoptotic cell death was only generated after the treatment of HL60 cells in conditions in which the generation of chloride-derived compounds was favored.

Treatment with the coplanar, non-ortho-substituted congener 3,3',4,4'-tetrachlorobiphenyl had no effect on MPO release. 2,2',4,4'-Tetrachlorobiphenyl caused a time- and dose-dependent release of [3H]-arachidonic acid (3H-AA). A significant increase in 3H-AA release was observed after 60 min of exposure, and concentrations of 10 microM or larger increased 3H-AA release. In contrast, 3,3',4,4'-tetrachlorobiphenyl had no effect on 3H-AA release. The effect of PCBs on mRNA levels for cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) was examined using semiquantitative RT-PCR. COX-2 mRNA was significantly elevated in response to 2,2',4,4'-tetrachlorobiphenyl in a concentration-dependent manner. COX-2 expression was maximal by 30 min of exposure to 2,2',4,4'-tetrachlorobiphenyl. COX-2 protein and activity were also increased after exposure to 2,2',4,4'-tetrachlorobiphenyl; COX-1 protein and activity were unaffected. 3,3',4,4'-Tetrachlorobiphenyl did not increase COX-2 mRNA levels. These results demonstrate that a noncoplanar PCB alters the functional status of granulocytic HL-60 cells, causing enhanced degranulation and upregulation of COX-2, whereas a coplanar PCB lacks this activity. These data suggest that noncoplanar PCBs alter HL-60 cell function and COX-2 expression via an Ah-receptor-independent mechanism.","['Bezdecny, Steven A', 'Roth, Robert A', 'Ganey, Patricia E']","['Bezdecny SA', 'Roth RA', 'Ganey PE']","['Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Center for Integrative Toxicology and National Food Safety and Toxicology Center, Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan 48824, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",20050126,United States,Toxicol Sci,Toxicological sciences : an official journal of the Society of Toxicology,9805461,"['0 (Environmental Pollutants)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '10028-17-8 (Tritium)', '27YG812J1I (Arachidonic Acid)', ""4470AQR07D (2,4,2',4'-tetrachlorobiphenyl)"", 'DFC2HB4I0K (Polychlorinated Biphenyls)', 'EC 1.11.1.7 (Peroxidase)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (Cyclooxygenase 2)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (PTGS2 protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthases)']",IM,"['Arachidonic Acid/metabolism', 'Cell Degranulation/*drug effects', 'Cyclooxygenase 2', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Environmental Pollutants/*toxicity', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells/*drug effects/enzymology', 'Humans', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Neutrophils/*drug effects/enzymology', 'Peroxidase/metabolism', 'Polychlorinated Biphenyls/*toxicity', 'Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthases/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tritium']",2005/01/28 09:00,2005/07/12 09:00,['2005/01/28 09:00'],"['2005/01/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/12 09:00 [medline]', '2005/01/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['kfi093 [pii]', '10.1093/toxsci/kfi093 [doi]']",ppublish,Toxicol Sci. 2005 Apr;84(2):328-34. doi: 10.1093/toxsci/kfi093.
