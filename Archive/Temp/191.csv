The major health concern for humans is acute myelogenous leukemia. To exert its toxic effects, benzene must be metabolized via cytochrome P450. CYP2E1 has been identified as the most important cytochrome, P450 isozyme in hepatic benzene metabolism in mice, rats, and humans. In pulmonary microsomes CYP2E1 and members of the CYP2F subfamily are both significantly involved. In the current study CYP2E1 knockout mice and wild-type controls were used to further examine the cytochrome P450 isozymes involved in metabolism of 24 microM benzene. The results show that CYP2E1 is the most important isozyme in the liver, accounting for 96% of the total hydroxylated metabolite formation. However, in the lung CYP2E1 was responsible for only 45% of the formation of total hydroxylated metabolite. Chemical inhibitors of CYP2E1 and CYP2F2 were used to further examine the contributions of these isozymes to benzene metabolism. The results confirmed the finding that while CYP2E1 is the most important isozyme in the liver, CYP2F2 and CYP2E1 are both significantly involved in the lung.","['Powley, M W', 'Carlson, G P']","['Powley MW', 'Carlson GP']","['School of Health Sciences, 1338 Civil Engineering Building, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN 47907-1338, USA.']",['eng'],['T01/CCT510467/CC/ODCDC CDC HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Ireland,Toxicology,Toxicology,0361055,"['0 (Catechols)', '0 (Cytochrome P-450 CYP2E1 Inhibitors)', '0 (Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Hydroquinones)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '339NCG44TV (Phenol)', '9035-51-2 (Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System)', 'EC 1.14.13.- (Cytochrome P-450 CYP2E1)', 'EC 1.14.14.- (Cyp2f2 protein, mouse)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)', 'LF3AJ089DQ (catechol)', 'XV74C1N1AE (hydroquinone)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Benzene/*metabolism', 'Biotransformation/drug effects/physiology', 'Catechols/analysis/metabolism', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2E1/*deficiency/*metabolism', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2E1 Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System/metabolism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Hydroquinones/analysis/metabolism', 'Isoenzymes/antagonists & inhibitors/deficiency/metabolism', 'Lung/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Microsomes/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Microsomes, Liver/chemistry/metabolism', 'Phenol/analysis/metabolism']",2001/11/24 10:00,2002/01/30 10:01,['2001/11/24 10:00'],"['2001/11/24 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/30 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/24 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0300483X01005194 [pii]', '10.1016/s0300-483x(01)00519-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Toxicology. 2001 Dec 28;169(3):187-94. doi: 10.1016/s0300-483x(01)00519-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The simple retrovirus packages two copies of its RNA genome by a mechanism that involves interactions between the nucleocapsid (NC) domain of a virally-encoded Gag polyprotein and a segment of the RNA genome located just upstream of the Gag initiation codon, known as the Psi-site. Previous studies indicated that the MLV Psi-site contains three stem loops (SLB-SLD), and that stem loops SLC and SLD play prominent roles in packaging. We have developed a method for the preparation and purification of large quantities of recombinant Moloney MLV NC protein, and have studied its interactions with a series of oligoribonucleotides that contain one or more of the Psi-RNA stem loops. At RNA concentrations above approximately 0.3 mM, isolated stem loop SLB forms a duplex and stem loops SL-C and SL-D form kissing complexes, as expected from previous studies. However, neither the monomeric nor the dimeric forms of these isolated stem loops binds NC with significant affinity. Longer constructs containing two stem loops (SL-BC and SL-CD) also exhibit low affinities for NC. However, NC binds with high affinity and stoichiometrically to both the monomeric and dimeric forms of an RNA construct that contains all three stem loops (SL-BCD; K(d)=132(+/-55) nM). Titration of SL-BCD with NC also shifts monomer-dimer equilibrium toward the dimer. Mutagenesis experiments demonstrate that the conserved GACG tetraloops of stem loops C and D do not influence the monomer-dimer equilibrium of SL-BCD, that the tetraloop of stem loop B does not participate directly in NC binding, and that the tetraloops of stem loops C and D probably also do not bind to NC. These surprising results differ considerably from those observed for HIV-1, where NC binds to individual stem loops with high affinity via interactions with exposed residues of the tetraloops. The present results indicate that MLV NC binds to a pocket or surface that only exists in the presence of all three stem loops.","[""D'Souza, V"", 'Melamed, J', 'Habib, D', 'Pullen, K', 'Wallace, K', 'Summers, M F']","[""D'Souza V"", 'Melamed J', 'Habib D', 'Pullen K', 'Wallace K', 'Summers MF']","['Howard Hughes Medical Institute and Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Maryland Baltimore County, 1000 Hilltop Circle, Baltimore, MD 21250, USA.']",['eng'],"['GM08663/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'GM42561/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,J Mol Biol,Journal of molecular biology,2985088R,"['0 (RNA Splice Sites)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Solutions)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Calorimetry', 'Conserved Sequence/genetics', 'Dimerization', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', '*Genome, Viral', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Models, Biological', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/chemistry/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Nucleic Acid Conformation', 'Nucleocapsid/genetics/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Point Mutation/genetics', 'Protein Binding', 'RNA Splice Sites/genetics', 'RNA, Viral/chemistry/genetics/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/genetics/isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid/*genetics', 'Solutions', 'Temperature', 'Thermodynamics', '*Virus Assembly']",2001/11/24 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/11/24 10:00'],"['2001/11/24 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/24 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1006/jmbi.2001.5139 [doi]', 'S0022-2836(01)95139-3 [pii]']",ppublish,J Mol Biol. 2001 Nov 23;314(2):217-32. doi: 10.1006/jmbi.2001.5139.,['Copyright 2001 Academic Press.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Within the amino acid sequence of HALR were identified a SUVAR3-9, enhancer of zeste, trithorax (SET) domain, three plant homeodomain (PHD)-type zinc fingers, a high motility group (HMG)-1 box, a leucine-zipper-like pattern, two potential transactivating domains, several nuclear localization signals, and multiple nuclear receptor interaction signature motifs. Especially within the SET domain, PHD fingers and several other regions, the HALR protein exhibits significant similarity to ALR (acute lymphoblastic leukemia [ALL]-1 related), ALL-1/myeloid/lymphoid or mixed-lineage leukemia (ALL-1/MLL), and trithorax, evolutionarily conserved proteins that influence differentiation and development. Northern blot analysis demonstrated transcripts of approximately 11-12 kb, while reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) revealed that HALR is expressed in a wide range of human tissues and cancer cell lines. The HALR gene contains 46 exons, is estimated to span >101 kb, and is located on chromosome region 7q36. Terminal 7q deletions are common chromosomal aberrations encountered in hematological neoplasia and in holoprosencephaly 3, a midline embryonic defect involving forebrain development. We have also isolated the partial cDNA of the murine homologue of HALR, which displays high homology to its human counterpart. Taking into consideration its notable protein motifs, ubiquitous expression, evolutionary conservation and chromosomal position, HALR is likely to play a housekeeping role in transcriptional regulation, and may be involved in leukemogenesis and developmental disorders.","['Tan, Y C', 'Chow, V T']","['Tan YC', 'Chow VT']","['Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Kent Ridge.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cancer Detect Prev,Cancer detection and prevention,7704778,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (KMT2C protein, human)', '0 (KMT2D protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7/*genetics', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA, Complementary/analysis', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Fetus/metabolism', 'Gene Expression', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', '*Neoplasm Proteins', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', '*Transcription Factors', 'Zinc Fingers/genetics']",2001/11/23 10:00,2002/05/01 10:01,['2001/11/23 10:00'],"['2001/11/23 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/05/01 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/23 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Detect Prev. 2001;25(5):454-69.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: Five of the 6 patients had acute GVHD II-III at 42, 26, 66, 45 and 57 days after transplantation respectively and they recovered after proper treatment. However they soon had severe diarrhea, abdominal pain or/and gastrointestinal bleeding, 5 of the 6 patients received endoscopic examination with biopsy at 50, 57, 80, 65, 35 days after transplantation respectively. They were all diagnosed as having CMV enteritis based on the presence of cytomegalic cells on mucosal biopsy specimens stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Meanwhile the immunoperoxidase stain of histologic specimens for CMV antigen or in situ hybridization by CMV DNA probe was positive. One patient was diagnosed CMV enteritis at 138 days after transplantation based on the clinic and response to therapy. They received antiviral treatment with ganciclovir (DHPG) 500 mg/d for 4 to 21 days, foscarnet 2.4 g q8 h or 4.8 g q12 h for 21 to 90 days, garlic extract 60-120 mg/d, globulin and other supportive measures. All the 6 cases had complete clinical response. CONCLUSION: CMV enteritis should be diagnosed as soon as possible with histopathologic examination and early proper treatment may lead to good clinical response.","['Xu, L', 'Guo, N', 'Ren, H']","['Xu L', 'Guo N', 'Ren H']","[""Institute of Hematology, People's Hospital, Peking University, Beijing 100044, China.""]",['chi'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",China,Zhonghua Nei Ke Za Zhi,Zhonghua nei ke za zhi,16210490R,['0 (HLA Antigens)'],IM,"['Adult', '*Cytomegalovirus/immunology', 'Cytomegalovirus Infections/immunology/*therapy', 'Enteritis/immunology/*therapy/virology', 'Female', 'HLA Antigens/analysis', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",2001/11/23 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/11/23 10:00'],"['2001/11/23 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/23 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Nei Ke Za Zhi. 2001 Aug;40(8):546-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: Our results showed that R9158 or all-trans retinoic acid (RA) significantly inhibited the growth and colony formation of acute promyelocytic leukemia NB4 cells, while NBT-reduction (a functional differentiation marker of granulocytic) was dramatically increased when the cells were exposed to R9158 at 10(-9)-10(-6) mol/L, and the NBT positive cells reached about 97.5% at 10(-6) mol/L after 6 days expouse. The ED50 of NBT-reduction was achieved at concentration of 3.9 x 10(-9) mol/L and 2.8 x 10(-9) mol/L for R9158 and RA, respectively. Morphologically, most of the cells induced by R9158 and RA at 10(-6) mol/L were in the myelocytic or metamyelocytic stage and a few cells were in the banded or segmented stage. Cytogenetic analysis revealed that the karyotype of NB4 cells was subtetraploid and the chromosome numbers were in the range of 71-99, when NB4 cells were treated with R9158 or RA for 3-6 days, the abnormal polyploid chromosome numbers decreased to 72.9 +/- 6.9 (P < 0.01) or 68.5 +/- 7.0 (P < 0.01), but the t(15;17) translation did not disappear.

The unusual kinetics and differential effects observed between substrates of this enzyme confound the prediction of drug clearance and drug-drug interactions from in vitro data. We have investigated the hypothesis that CYP3A4 may bind multiple molecules simultaneously using diazepam (DZ) and testosterone (TS). Both substrates showed sigmoidal kinetics in B-lymphoblastoid microsomes containing a recombinant human CYP3A4 and reductase. When analyzed in combination, TS activated the formation of 3-hydroxydiazepam (3HDZ) and N-desmethyldiazepam (NDZ) (maximal activation 374 and 205%, respectively). For 3HDZ, V(max) values remained constant with increasing TS, whereas the S(50) and Hill values decreased, tending to make the data less sigmoidal. Similar trends were observed for the NDZ pathway. DZ inhibited the formation 6beta-hydroxytestosterone (maximal inhibition, 45% of control), causing a decrease in V(max) but no significant change to the S(50) and Hill values, suggesting that DZ may inhibit via a separate effector site. Multisite rate equation models have been derived to explore the analysis of such complex kinetic data and to allow accurate determination of the kinetic parameters for activation and inhibition. The data and models presented are consistent with proposals that CYP3A4 can bind and metabolize multiple substrate molecules simultaneously; they also provide a generic solution for the interpretation of the complex kinetic data derived from CYP3A4 substrates.","['Kenworthy, K E', 'Clarke, S E', 'Andrews, J', 'Houston, J B']","['Kenworthy KE', 'Clarke SE', 'Andrews J', 'Houston JB']","['Department of Mechanism and Extrapolation Technologies, GlaxoSmithKline, The Frythe, Welwyn, Herts, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Drug Metab Dispos,Drug metabolism and disposition: the biological fate of chemicals,9421550,"['0 (Anti-Anxiety Agents)', '3XMK78S47O (Testosterone)', '9035-51-2 (Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System)', 'EC 1.- (Mixed Function Oxygenases)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (CYP3A protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A)', 'EC 1.14.14.55 (CYP3A4 protein, human)', 'Q3JTX2Q7TU (Diazepam)']",IM,"['Algorithms', 'Anti-Anxiety Agents/*pharmacokinetics', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Line', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System/*metabolism', 'Diazepam/*pharmacokinetics', 'Drug Interactions', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/metabolism', 'Microsomes/enzymology', 'Mixed Function Oxygenases/*metabolism', 'Models, Biological', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Testosterone/*pharmacokinetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/11/22 10:00,2002/02/01 10:01,['2001/11/22 10:00'],"['2001/11/22 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/02/01 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/22 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Drug Metab Dispos. 2001 Dec;29(12):1644-51.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The murine Mx1 protein accumulates in the nucleus of interferon-treated cells and is active against members of the Orthomyxoviridae family, such as the influenza viruses and Thogoto virus. The mechanism by which Mx1 exerts its antiviral action is still unclear, but an involvement of undefined nuclear factors has been postulated. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, we identified cellular proteins that interact with Mx1 protein. The Mx1 interactors were mainly nuclear proteins. They included Sp100, Daxx, and Bloom's syndrome protein (BLM), all of which are known to localize to specific subnuclear domains called promyelocytic leukemia protein nuclear bodies (PML NBs). In addition, components of the SUMO-1 protein modification system were identified as Mx1-interacting proteins, namely the small ubiquitin-like modifier SUMO-1 and SAE2, which represents subunit 2 of the SUMO-1 activating enzyme. Analysis of the subcellular localization of Mx1 and some of these interacting proteins by confocal microscopy revealed a close spatial association of Mx1 with PML NBs. This suggests a role of PML NBs and SUMO-1 in the antiviral action of Mx1 and may allow us to discover novel functions of this large GTPase.","['Engelhardt, O G', 'Ullrich, E', 'Kochs, G', 'Haller, O']","['Engelhardt OG', 'Ullrich E', 'Kochs G', 'Haller O']","['Abteilung Virologie, Institut fur Medizinische Mikrobiologie und Hygiene, Freiburg, D-79008, Germany. oengel@ukl.uni-freiburg.de']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Antigens, Nuclear)', '0 (Autoantigens)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Co-Repressor Proteins)', '0 (DAXX protein, human)', '0 (Daxx protein, mouse)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Molecular Chaperones)', '0 (Mx1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myxovirus Resistance Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Pml protein, mouse)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (SUMO-1 Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '135844-47-2 (Sp100 protein, human)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', '9008-11-1 (Interferons)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (Adenosine Triphosphatases)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (Bloom syndrome protein)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP Phosphohydrolases)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'EC 3.6.4.- (DNA Helicases)', 'EC 3.6.4.12 (RecQ Helicases)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Adenosine Triphosphatases/metabolism', 'Animals', '*Antigens, Nuclear', 'Autoantigens/metabolism', 'Carrier Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Compartmentation/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Nucleus/drug effects/*enzymology/virology', 'Co-Repressor Proteins', 'DNA Helicases/metabolism', 'GTP Phosphohydrolases/drug effects/*metabolism', '*GTP-Binding Proteins', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic/drug effects/genetics', 'HeLa Cells/cytology/drug effects/enzymology', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Interferons/*metabolism/pharmacology', '*Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Mice', 'Molecular Chaperones', 'Myxovirus Resistance Proteins', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Proteins/drug effects/*metabolism', 'RecQ Helicases', 'SUMO-1 Protein/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/cytology/drug effects/enzymology', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Two-Hybrid System Techniques', 'Viruses/*metabolism']",2001/11/22 10:00,2002/01/12 10:01,['2001/11/22 10:00'],"['2001/11/22 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/12 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/22 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1006/excr.2001.5380 [doi]', 'S0014-4827(01)95380-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 2001 Dec 10;271(2):286-95. doi: 10.1006/excr.2001.5380.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is therefore of interest to understand their nuclear ultrastructure. PML oncogenic domains (PODs) were described in several types of eukaryotic cells using human autoantibodies which recognize nuclear antigens with a specific speckled pattern (dots) in indirect immunofluorescence (IF). Two main antigens, PML and Sp 100, usually colocalize and concentrate in these nuclear subdomains. We investigated the presence of PODs using IF and immunoelectron microscopy (IEM) in cells from megakaryocytic lineage: the HEL cell line and human cultured Mks. Antibodies against PML, Sp100, and anti-nuclear dots were used in single and double labeling. PODs were identified in HEL cells and in human Mks, and their ultrastructure was characterized. We then used IF to quantify PODs within Mks and showed that their number increased proportionally to nuclear lobularity. In summary, we report the identification of PODs in human Mks at an ultrastructural level and an increase in PODs number in parallel with Mk ploidy. We show that endomitosis not only leads to DNA increase but also to the multiplication of at least one of the associated nuclear structures.","['Drouin, A', 'Schmitt, A', 'Masse, J M', 'Cieutat, A M', 'Fichelson, S', 'Cramer, E M']","['Drouin A', 'Schmitt A', 'Masse JM', 'Cieutat AM', 'Fichelson S', 'Cramer EM']","['Institut Cochin de Genetique Moleculaire, INSERM U. 474, Paris, France.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (Antigens, Nuclear)', '0 (Autoantibodies)', '0 (Autoantigens)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '135844-47-2 (Sp100 protein, human)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)']",IM,"['*Antigens, Nuclear', 'Autoantibodies', 'Autoantigens/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Compartmentation/*genetics', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism/*ultrastructure', 'Cells, Cultured/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic/immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Megakaryocytes/metabolism/*ultrastructure', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Mitosis/physiology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Oncogenes/*genetics', 'Polyploidy', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary/genetics', 'Spindle Apparatus/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",2001/11/22 10:00,2002/01/12 10:01,['2001/11/22 10:00'],"['2001/11/22 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/12 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/22 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1006/excr.2001.5377 [doi]', 'S0014-4827(01)95377-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 2001 Dec 10;271(2):277-85. doi: 10.1006/excr.2001.5377.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite the presence of constitutively active v-raf in these cells, Raf-1 exokinase activity increased after erythropoietin stimulation. This increase in enzymatic activity coincided with tyrosine phosphorylation of Raf-1 on residue Y341. Significantly, the tyrosine kinase Lyn coimmunoprecipitated with Raf-1, and Raf-1 was not tyrosine-phosphorylated in a J2E subclone lacking Lyn.

Previous studies have shown that the glycoside moiety of etoposide is not necessary for cytotoxicity or DNA topoisomerase II inhibition. For this reason, we designed two epipodophyllotoxin derivatives for which the dispensable sugar moiety of etoposide has been replaced by a m-methoxy-methane-sulfonamide-anilino group analogous to the topoisomerase II-targeted domain of amsacrine. We report the synthesis of the hybrid molecules that have the epipodophyllotoxin and anilino groups directly linked (ICP-114) or connected by an ethylene spacer (ICP-147). Plasmid DNA relaxation and kinetoplast DNA decatenation assays were used to evaluate the effects of the drug on the catalytic activity of human topoisomerase II. We found that the hybrid ICP-147 was significantly more potent than both etoposide and amsacrine at stimulating DNA cleavage by the enzyme, whereas the hybrid ICP-114 lacking the linker chain was less potent. ICP-147 produces approximately 3 times more double-stranded breaks than ICP-114, suggesting that an ethylene spacer between the epipodophyllotoxin and amsacrine moieties is highly effective at inhibiting topoisomerase II. Sequencing data also supported the idea that the two moieties of ICP-147 participate to the interaction with topoisomerase II-DNA covalent complexes. Both hybrid compounds are more cytotoxic than etoposide but much less toxic than amsacrine toward L1210 leukemia cells. In addition to its effect on topoisomerase II, ICP-114 can inhibit tubulin polymerization, whereas ICP-147 is almost totally inactive in this assay. The unexpected capacity of ICP-114 to interfere with the polymerization of tubulin suggests that this compound can target tubulin dimers, as it is the case with certain antitumor sulfonamides. The design of etoposide-amsacrine hybrids may thus represent an opportunity for the discovery of dual inhibitors that target both topoisomerase II and tubulin.","['Arimondo, P', 'Boukarim, C', 'Bailly, C', 'Dauzonne, D', 'Monneret, C']","['Arimondo P', 'Boukarim C', 'Bailly C', 'Dauzonne D', 'Monneret C']","['Laboratoire de Pharmacologie Antitumorale du Centre Oscar Lambret, et INSERM U-524, IRCL, Lille, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Anticancer Drug Des,Anti-cancer drug design,8603523,"['0 (Biopolymers)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '0 (Tubulin)', '0 (Tubulin Modulators)', '00DPD30SOY (Amsacrine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)']",IM,"['Amsacrine/*chemistry', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Biopolymers', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/chemistry', 'DNA, Neoplasm', 'Etoposide/*chemistry', 'Leukemia L1210/pathology', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Topoisomerase II Inhibitors', 'Tubulin/chemistry', '*Tubulin Modulators', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/11/22 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/11/22 10:00'],"['2001/11/22 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/22 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Drug Des. 2000 Dec;15(6):413-21.,,,['Anticancer Drug Des 2001 Feb;16(1):71'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The catalytic activity resides in the larger subunit in the heterodimeric (p66/p51) enzyme while in the monomeric form it is inactive. In contrast, Murine leukemia virus RT (MuLV RT) is functionally active in the monomeric form. In the primary amino acid sequence alignment of MuLV RT and HIV-1 RT, we have identified three specific regions in MuLV RT, that were missing in HIV-1 RT. In a separate study, we have shown that a chimeric RT construct comprising of the polymerase domain of HIV-1 RT and RNase-H domain of MuLV RT is functionally active as monomer [20]. In this communication, we demonstrate that insertion of a peptide (corresponding to amino acid residues 480-506) from the connection subdomain of MuLV RT into the connection subdomain of HIV-1 RT (between residues 429 and 430) results in a functionally active monomeric chimeric RT. Furthermore, this chimeric enzyme does not dimerize with exogenously added p51 subunit of HIV-1RT. Functional analysis of the chimeric RT revealed template specific variations in its catalytic activity. The chimeric enzyme catalyzes DNA synthesis on both heteropolymeric DNA and homopolymeric RNA (poly rA) template but curiously lacks reverse transcriptase ability on heteropolymeric RNA template. Similar to MuLV RT, the polymerase activity of the chimeric enzyme is not affected by acetonitrile, a reagent which dissociates dimeric HIV-1 RT into inactive monomers. These results together with a proposed 3-D molecular model of the chimeric enzyme suggests that the insertion of the missing region may induce a change in the spatial position of RNase H domain such that it is functionally active in monomeric conformation.","['Pandey, P K', 'Kaushik, N', 'Talele, T T', 'Yadav, P N', 'Pandey, V N']","['Pandey PK', 'Kaushik N', 'Talele TT', 'Yadav PN', 'Pandey VN']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, UMD-New Jersey Medical School, Newark 07103, USA. pandey@umdnj.edu']",['eng'],['CA 72831/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Mol Cell Biochem,Molecular and cellular biochemistry,0364456,"['0 (Acetonitriles)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (HIV Reverse Transcriptase)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)', 'Z072SB282N (acetonitrile)']",IM,"['Acetonitriles/pharmacology', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Catalytic Domain', 'Dimerization', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Escherichia coli/genetics', 'HIV Reverse Transcriptase/*chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*enzymology', 'Mice', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis, Insertional', 'Peptides/chemistry', 'Protein Conformation', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'RNA, Viral/biosynthesis', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/*chemistry/genetics', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/chemistry/metabolism', 'Sequence Alignment']",2001/11/22 10:00,2002/05/10 10:01,['2001/11/22 10:00'],"['2001/11/22 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/05/10 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/22 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1023/a:1012278308154 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biochem. 2001 Sep;225(1-):135-44. doi: 10.1023/a:1012278308154.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mobilisation of the patient's immune system against malignant cells remaining after conventional treatment is an attractive therapeutic option since lymphocytes respond with high sensitivity and specificity to non-self. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The potential of cancer vaccines targeted to T helper cells is discussed on the basis of published data including the author's studies. RESULTS: T helper cells kill cancer cells by direct cell-cell contact, stimulate other cytotoxic effector cells and respond to autologous tumour antigens like HER-2/neu (mammary and ovary cancer), tyrosinase (malignant melanoma), p21 ras (colorectal and pancreatic cancer), BCR-ABL (chronic myeloid leukaemia) and immunoglobulin (B-cell lymphoma). HER-2/neu and tyrosinase are not mutated, p21 ras and BCR-ABL represent a restricted set of mutations, and genetic variants of immunoglobulin can be characterised by hybridoma technology. INTERPRETATION: Targeted screening can, in a large number of cancer patients, identify peptide sequences potentially useful for therapeutic immunisation. Peptides can be designed to combine immunogenicity in the individual patient with proteolytic resistance, and are presently being tested as cancer vaccines.","['Bartnes, K']",['Bartnes K'],['Avdeling for hjerte-/lunge-/karkirurgi Regionsykehuset i Tromso 9038 Tromso. kirkrb@rito.no'],['nor'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Norway,Tidsskr Nor Laegeforen,"Tidsskrift for den Norske laegeforening : tidsskrift for praktisk medicin, ny raekke",0413423,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Cancer Vaccines)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)', '0 (Vaccines, Subunit)']",IM,"['Antigens, Neoplasm/genetics/*immunology', 'Cancer Vaccines/genetics/*immunology', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II/genetics/immunology', 'Humans', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasms/genetics/*immunology/prevention & control', 'T-Lymphocytes, Helper-Inducer/*immunology', 'Vaccines, Subunit/genetics/*immunology']",2001/11/22 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/11/22 10:00'],"['2001/11/22 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/22 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Tidsskr Nor Laegeforen. 2001 Oct 20;121(25):2941-5.,,58,,Tumorantigener presentert for T-hjelpelymfocytter--kreftvaksinens kritiske komponenter.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) cell line NB4, chronic lymphoblastic leukemia (CLL) cell line SKW-3, Burkitt's lymphoma cell line Namalwa and other acute myeloid leukemia cell lines HL-60 and U937 were used as in vitro models. The delta psi m was detected by the double staining of propidium iodide (PI) and Rhodamine 123(Rh123), while apoptosis was confirmed by cell viability, sub-G1 cell content as well as gel electrophoresis of genomic DNA and morphological observation. In addition, cellular content of malondialdehyde (MDA) was detected. RESULTS: In the cells sensitive to As2O3-induced apoptosis, the delta psi m was disrupted with As2O3 treatment. The disulfide-bond reducing agent dithiothreitol (DTT) significantly blocked As2O3-induced delta psi m collapse and apoptosis. For example, with 1 mumol/L As2O3 treatment for 48 hours, PI- Rh123- cells was increased to (16.0 +/- 2.5)%, and DTT simultaneous treatment reduced PI- Rh123- cells and apoptotic cells to (2.9 +/- 0.2)%, and (1.8 +/- 0.3)%, respectively. On the other hand, As2O3 also significantly induced MDA production in NB4(0.479 +/- 0.044, P < 0.01) and SKW-3 (0.168 +/- 0.018) nmol/L, P < 0.01) cells, whereas the effect could not be blocked by DTT.

METHODS: The cancer mortality data of 1979-1986 were collected from a dynamic cohort by prospective survey. The data of 1987-1995 were obtained from a fixed cohort by retrospective and/or prospective survey. The mortality investigation on the spot consisted of two steps, i.e. the follow-up of the members in the cohort and the ascertainment of the death causes. The estimate of cumulative individual dose of the cohort members included that of the exposure from natural external and internal sources. Both direct (TLD measurement) and indirect (environmental measurement and occupancy pattern) approaches were used for individual external dose estimate. On the basis of the hamlet-specific average annual external dose, the cohort members were classified into four groups for internal comparison: high, medial and low dose groups from HBRA and control group from control area (CA). Relative risk (RR) and excess relative risk coefficient (ERR per sievert) and its 95% confidence interval (CI) was estimated using AMFIT program in Epicure. RESULTS: During the period 1979-1995, there were 10,415 total deaths and 1003 cancer deaths among 1,698,350 person-years at risk in the cohort of 125,079 subjects. The adjusted RR (95% CI) with sex and age group for all cancers of whole HBRA was 0.99 (0.87-1.14). As for the site-specific cancer of whole HBRA, the RRs of cancers of stomach, colon, liver, lungs, bone, female breast, and thyroid were less than one, while the RRs of cancers of nasopharynx, esophagus, rectum, pancreas, skin, cervix uterus, brain and central nervous system, leukemia and lymphoma were larger than one. However, all of them except for esophagus cancer were not different statistically from one (P > 0.05). The homogeneity tests of RRs for all cancers and for site-specific cancer among the three dose groups in HBRA revealed that the RRs in these dose groups were not different statistically (P > 0.05) for all. The ERR (95% CI)/Sv of all cancers for both sexes and all ages was -0.10 (-0.67, 0.69). CONCLUSION: An increased cancer risk associated with the high levels of natural radiation in HBRA was not found. On the contrary, the mortality of all cancers in HBRA was generally lower than that in CA, but not significant statistically.","['Tao, Z', 'Cha, Y', 'Sun, Q']","['Tao Z', 'Cha Y', 'Sun Q']","['Laboratory of Industrial Hygiene, Ministry of Health, Beijing 100088, China.']",['chi'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",China,Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua yi xue za zhi,7511141,,IM,"['*Background Radiation', 'China/epidemiology', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Liver Neoplasms/*mortality', 'Male', 'Nasopharyngeal Neoplasms/*mortality', 'Neoplasms/mortality', 'Prospective Studies', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Stomach Neoplasms/mortality']",2001/11/22 10:00,2002/01/23 10:01,['2001/11/22 10:00'],"['2001/11/22 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/23 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/22 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi. 1999 Jul;79(7):487-92.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has shown promising anticancer activity in many preclinical systems and is currently in early clinical trials. Our aim in this study was to assess the growth inhibitory effect of CHS 828 in comparison with paclitaxel, etoposide, and topotecan as a function of concentration and time. U937 GTB, RPMI 8226/S, MDA 231, primary cells from chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and normal mononuclear cells were exposed to CHS 828 and U937 GTB cells were exposed to paclitaxel, etoposide, and topotecan in 18 concentrations for times ranging from 1 to 72 h. Cell survival was measured after 72-h incubation by using the fluorometric microculture cytotoxicity assay. Nonlinear mixed effect modeling was used to model the concentration-effect curves with a modified Hill equation. Patterns of change of drug potency (IC(50)), slope of the concentration-effect curves, and plateau with time were studied. The log IC(50) for CHS 828 decreased with log time in a sigmoid manner for all cell types tested. Although very steep at short and long incubation, the concentration-effect curves became shallow at intermediate times. The log IC(50) for etoposide and topotecan was decreased with log time in a sigmoid manner. The log IC(50) for paclitaxel decreased linearly with log time. The information obtained from modeling the cytotoxic effect of CHS 828 and changes of IC(50) and slope parameters with exposure time suggests a heterogeneous cell response to CHS 828.

A subgroup of patients with severe congenital neutropenia (SCN) has been shown to harbor mutations in the G-CSF receptor gene that resulted in the truncation of the receptor's carboxyl-terminal region. SCN patients with mutations in the G-CSF receptor gene are predisposed to acute myeloid leukemia. The truncated receptors from SCN/acute myeloid leukemia patients mediate augmented and sustained activation of Stat transcription factors and are accordingly hyperactive in inducing cell proliferation and survival but are defective in inducing differentiation. Little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying the negative role of the receptor's carboxyl terminus in the regulation of Stat activation and cell proliferation/survival. In this study, we provide evidence that SH2-containing phosphatase-1 (SHP-1) plays a negative regulatory role in G-CSF-induced Stat activation. We also demonstrate that the carboxyl terminus of the G-CSF receptor is required for SHP-1 down-regulation of Stat activation induced by G-CSF. Our results indicate further that this regulation is highly specific because SHP-1 has no effect on the activation of Akt and extracellular signal-related kinase1/2 by G-CSF. The data together strongly suggest that SHP-1 may represent an important mechanism by which the carboxyl terminus of the G-CSF receptor down-regulates G-CSF-induced Stat activation and thereby inhibits cell proliferation and survival in response to G-CSF.","['Dong, F', 'Qiu, Y', 'Yi, T', 'Touw, I P', 'Larner, A C']","['Dong F', 'Qiu Y', 'Yi T', 'Touw IP', 'Larner AC']","['Department of Immunology, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, OH 44195, USA. dongf@ccf.org']",['eng'],"['1R01CA79891-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1R01GM58893/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'CA77736/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA77741/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Receptors, Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Protein Phosphatase 1)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (PTPN6 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 6)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Chickens', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/congenital/*enzymology/genetics', 'Neutropenia/congenital/*enzymology/genetics', 'Peptide Fragments/genetics/*physiology', 'Protein Phosphatase 1', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 6', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases/*physiology', 'Receptors, Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/genetics/*physiology', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', '*Sequence Deletion', 'Signal Transduction/*genetics', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Transfection']",2001/11/21 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/11/21 10:00'],"['2001/11/21 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/21 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.4049/jimmunol.167.11.6447 [doi]'],ppublish,J Immunol. 2001 Dec 1;167(11):6447-52. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.167.11.6447.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite the presumed ""silent"" nature of apoptotic cell death, forced expression of FasL can induce a dramatic inflammatory response. To elucidate the in vivo mechanism(s) linking FasL and inflammation, we used a membrane-bound cell-free form of FasL (mFasL-vesicle preparation (VP)). We found that i.p. injection of FasL-microvesicles led to the rapid activation and subsequent demise of Mac1(high) resident peritoneal macrophages. Apoptosis of Mac1(high) peritoneal macrophages was observed within 0.5 h of mFasL-VP injection and correlated with the detection of increased macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-2 levels in peritoneal lavage fluid as well as induced RNA expression of IL-1beta, MIP-2, MIP-1alpha, and MIP-1beta. In vitro culture of purified peritoneal populations identified Mac1(high) cells as the major cytokine/chemokine producers in response to mFasL-VP. Purified Mac1(high) cells exposed to FasL could restore the ability of Fas-deficient mice to mount an inflammatory response. Our data demonstrate that the FasL-mediated inflammatory response starts with the production of proinflammatory mediators by preapoptotic resident tissue macrophages and suggest a general mechanism responsible for neutrophil inflammation seen in cases of FasL-expressing allografts.","['Hohlbaum, A M', 'Gregory, M S', 'Ju, S T', 'Marshak-Rothstein, A']","['Hohlbaum AM', 'Gregory MS', 'Ju ST', 'Marshak-Rothstein A']","['Department of Microbiology, School of Medicine, Boston University, Boston, MA 02118, USA.']",['eng'],"['AI36938/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'GM58724/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'T32-CA64070/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Chemokines)', '0 (Chemotactic Factors)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Fasl protein, mouse)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (fas Receptor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/genetics/*immunology', 'Ascitic Fluid/immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Separation', 'Chemokines/biosynthesis/genetics/metabolism', 'Chemotactic Factors/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Cytokines/biosynthesis/genetics/metabolism', 'Cytoplasmic Vesicles/immunology', 'Fas Ligand Protein', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation/immunology', 'Inflammation/immunology', 'Leukemia L5178', 'Ligands', 'Macrophages, Peritoneal/*immunology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*metabolism/physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred A', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Mice, Inbred MRL lpr', 'Mice, Mutant Strains', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neutrophils/*immunology/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins', 'Transcription Factors', 'fas Receptor/genetics/*metabolism']",2001/11/21 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/11/21 10:00'],"['2001/11/21 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/21 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.4049/jimmunol.167.11.6217 [doi]'],ppublish,J Immunol. 2001 Dec 1;167(11):6217-24. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.167.11.6217.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Paradoxically, it is also carcinogenic. In the process of elucidating a mechanism of arsenic resistance in a leukemia cell line, NB4, we discovered that arsenic exposure causes chromosomal abnormalities, with a preponderance of end-to-end fusions. These chromosomal end fusions suggested that telomerase activity may be inhibited by arsenic. We found that arsenic inhibits transcription of the hTERT gene, which encodes the reverse transcriptase subunit of human telomerase. This effect may in part be explained by decreased c-Myc and Sp1 transcription factor activities. Decreased telomerase activity leads to chromosomal end lesions, which promote either genomic instability and carcinogenesis or cancer cell death. These phenomena may explain the seemingly paradoxical carcinogenic and antitumor effects of arsenic.","['Chou, W C', 'Hawkins, A L', 'Barrett, J F', 'Griffin, C A', 'Dang, C V']","['Chou WC', 'Hawkins AL', 'Barrett JF', 'Griffin CA', 'Dang CV']","['Program in Human Genetics and Molecular Biology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA051497/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA051497/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-51497/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Sp1 Transcription Factor)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)', 'N712M78A8G (Arsenic)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Arsenic/*pharmacology', 'Base Sequence', 'Chromosomes, Human', 'DNA/metabolism', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Sp1 Transcription Factor/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Telomerase/*genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic/*drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/11/21 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/11/21 10:00'],"['2001/11/21 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/21 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1172/JCI14064 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Invest. 2001 Nov;108(10):1541-7. doi: 10.1172/JCI14064.,,,,,PMC209426,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although gp130 activation is observed transiently during transverse aortic constriction (TAC), its mechanism of inactivation is largely unknown in cardiomyocytes. We show here that suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3), an intrinsic inhibitor of JAK, shows biphasic induction in response to TAC. The induction of SOCS3 was closely correlated with STAT3 phosphorylation, as well as the activation of an embryonic gene program, suggesting that cardiac gp130-JAK signaling is precisely controlled by this endogenous suppressor. In addition to its cytoprotective action, gp130-dependent signaling induces cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. Adenovirus-mediated gene transfer of SOCS3 to ventricular cardiomyocytes completely suppressed both hypertrophy and antiapoptotic phenotypes induced by leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). To our knowledge, this is the first clear evidence that these two separate cardiomyocyte phenotypes induced by gp130 activation lie downstream of JAK. Three independent signaling pathways, STAT3, MEK1-ERK1/2, and AKT activation, that are coinduced by LIF stimulation were completely suppressed by SOCS3 overexpression.

As the chronic myeloid leukemia-associated BCR/ABL oncogene endows the adult hematopoietic stem cell with clonal dominance without inhibiting pluripotent lymphoid and myeloid differentiation, we have used BCR/ABL as a tool to enable engraftment and clonal analysis. We show that embryoid body-derived hematopoietic progenitors expressing BCR/ABL maintain a primitive hematopoietic blast stage of differentiation and generate only primitive erythroid cell types in vitro. These cells can be cloned, and when injected into irradiated adult mice, they differentiate into multiple myeloid cell types as well as T and B lymphocytes. While the injected cells express embryonic (beta-H1) globin, donor-derived erythroid cells in the recipient express only adult (beta-major) globin, suggesting that these cells undergo globin gene switching and developmental maturation in vivo.

The mutagenic and carcinogenic potential of hydroxyurea has not been established, although hydroxyurea has been associated with an increased risk of leukemia in MPD patients. To clarify whether hydroxyurea has potential carcinogenicity, we examined site-specific DNA damage induced by hydroxyurea using (32)P-5'-end-labeled DNA fragments obtained from the human p53 and p16 tumor suppressor genes and the c-Ha-ras-1 protooncogene. Hydroxyurea caused Cu(II)-mediated DNA damage especially at thymine and cytosine residues. NADH efficiently enhanced hydroxyurea-induced DNA damage. The DNA damage was almost entirely inhibited by catalase and bathocuproine, a Cu(I)-specific chelator, suggesting the involvement of hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) and Cu(I). Typical free hydroxyl radical scavengers did not inhibit DNA damage by hydroxyurea, but methional did. These results suggest that crypto-hydroxyl radicals such as Cu(I)-hydroperoxo complex (Cu(I)-OOH) cause DNA damage. Formation of 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) was induced by hydroxyurea in the presence of Cu(II). An electron spin resonance spectroscopic study using N-(dithiocarboxy)sarcosine as a nitric oxide (NO)-trapping reagent demonstrated that NO was generated from hydroxyurea in the presence and absence of catalase. In addition, the generation of formamide was detected by both gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and time-of-flight-mass spectrometry (TOF-MS). A high concentration of hydroxyurea induced depurination at DNA bases in an H(2)O(2)-independent manner, and endonuclease IV treatment led to chain cleavages. These results suggest that hydroxyurea could induce base oxidation as the major pathway of DNA modification and depurination as a minor pathway. Therefore, it is considered that DNA damage by hydroxyurea participates in not only anti-cancer activity, but also carcinogenesis.","['Sakano, K', 'Oikawa, S', 'Hasegawa, K', 'Kawanishi, S']","['Sakano K', 'Oikawa S', 'Hasegawa K', 'Kawanishi S']","['Department of Hygiene, Mie University School of Medicine, Tsu, Mie 514-8507.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Jpn J Cancer Res,Japanese journal of cancer research : Gann,8509412,"['0 (Cations, Divalent)', '0 (Free Radical Scavengers)', '0 (Phenanthrolines)', '0U46U6E8UK (NAD)', '31C4KY9ESH (Nitric Oxide)', '789U1901C5 (Copper)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', '9THP2V94FX (bathocuproine)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'EC 1.11.1.6 (Catalase)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Catalase/metabolism', 'Cations, Divalent/pharmacology', 'Cattle', 'Copper/pharmacology', 'DNA/drug effects/genetics/metabolism', 'DNA Damage/*drug effects', 'Electron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Free Radical Scavengers/pharmacology', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Genes, p16', 'Genes, p53/genetics', 'Genes, ras/genetics', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/*metabolism', 'Hydroxyurea/*pharmacology', 'NAD/metabolism', 'Nitric Oxide/*metabolism', 'Phenanthrolines/pharmacology', 'Substrate Specificity']",2001/11/21 10:00,2002/06/12 10:01,['2001/11/21 10:00'],"['2001/11/21 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/06/12 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/21 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1349-7006.2001.tb02136.x [doi]'],ppublish,Jpn J Cancer Res. 2001 Nov;92(11):1166-74. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.2001.tb02136.x.,,,,,PMC5926660,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using high-quality incidence data from 1973-1992 in nine population-based cancer registries (Alberta, Bombay, Denmark, Israel, New Zealand, Osaka, Oxford, Slovenia, Utah), we have examined past increases in specific lymphoid neoplasms. Further, by using a Bayesian age-period-cohort approach, we have calculated 5-, 10- and 15-year projections for each group of lymphoid neoplasms. RESULTS: NHL incidence increased in all centers by an average of 77% in men and 66% in women between 1973 and 1992. Fifteen-year projections of these rates to 2003-2007 indicate that they will increase by an average of 55% among men and 79% among women. High projected incidence rates above 15/100,000 in men and 10/100,000 in women are expected in Alberta, Denmark, Israel, New Zealand, Oxford, and Utah by 2003-2007. The one notable exception was among men from Osaka, where no increase was projected. Modest increases in leukemia and multiple myeloma rates were observed in most of the nine registries with further projected increases by 2007. Projected incidence rates of Hodgkin's disease indicated little change. CONCLUSION: Increases in NHL rates are occurring worldwide and provide no evidence of peaking. A key assumption in the projected rates is that the effect of environmental agents determining the trends during 1973-1992 will remain stable during the subsequent projection period.","['Bray, I', 'Brennan, P', 'Boffetta, P']","['Bray I', 'Brennan P', 'Boffetta P']","['Unit of Environmental Cancer Epidemiology, International Agency for Research on Cancer, Lyon, France.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Netherlands,Cancer Causes Control,Cancer causes & control : CCC,9100846,,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Bayes Theorem', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Forecasting', 'Hodgkin Disease/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Lymphoma/*epidemiology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*epidemiology', 'Male', 'Models, Statistical', 'Multiple Myeloma/epidemiology', 'Registries']",2001/11/21 10:00,2002/02/14 10:01,['2001/11/21 10:00'],"['2001/11/21 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/02/14 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/21 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1023/a:1012240117335 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Causes Control. 2001 Nov;12(9):813-20. doi: 10.1023/a:1012240117335.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One study, initiated in May 1999, at the Lombardi Cancer Center at Georgetown University Medical Center, US, will examine G-3139 in conjunction with docetaxel. In a phase I/IIa dose-escalating trial to treat non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), at the Royal Marsden NHS Trust, UK, no serious, clearly drug-attributable or doselimiting adverse effects were noted and in some patients encouraging signs of potential drug activity were observed. The responses included one patient in whom cancer mass was reduced and one who developed a complete response for over 38 weeks in duration [239159,291608,325262]. A new phase II protocol using G-3139 combined with standard chemotherapies in relapsed NHL patients has also begun [325262].

This review will focus on the application of ON-based therapeutics for hematological disease. The primary application of ONs has been as sequence specific inhibitors of gene expression, ie, antisense oligonucleotides (AS ON) and ribozymes. Based upon the unique expression of the Bcl-Abl neogene in CML cells, numerous studies have targeted this product with AS ONs and ribozymes. These studies demonstrate that ON targeting the breakpoint region selectively inhibit the proliferation of CML cells. Subsequent studies suggest that this effect may not be due to a true antisense effect of the ON. Other targets, which are being exploited for the treatment of hematological malignancies, include ON targeting c-myb gene, p53 and Bcl-2. All three have entered clinical trials and have been shown to be tolerated by patients. In addition to inhibition of gene expression, ON can be selected for sequence specific binding to proteins (aptamer). In particular an ON that binds to thrombin with high affinity is being explored as a potential anticoagulant. These early studies have identified limitations for first generation ON which may be solvable with newer ON chemistries and/or formulations.

The same phenomenon has also been observed in epithelial cells in vitro. However, such correlation between these 2 markers has not been shown in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), in which EBV infection is a well-known etiologic factor. This retrospective study examined 35 cases of undifferentiated NPC to answer the question of whether LMP1 and/or bcl-2 presence can be used as biomarkers at treatment response, as well as to see the relationship between bcl-2 and LMP in NPC. Of the 35 patients, 26 (74.3%) were bcl-2, and 10 (28.6%) were LMP1-positive. Although a significant correlation was observed between bcl-2 and LMP1 staining (P =.003), it appeared that bcl-2 expression could be independent of LMP1. Statistical analysis showed that cervical lymph node metastasis (P =.04) and cranial nerve involvement (P =.03) are the only variables that significantly affect patient survival. At this time, bcl-2 and LMP1 presence are not significant indicators of outcome; however, although they are not directly related to survival, expression of both bcl-2 and LMP1 was strongly correlated with cervical lymph node metastasis, which is a potent predictor of patient survival.","['Sarac, S', 'Akyol, M U', 'Kanbur, B', 'Poyraz, A', 'Akyol, G', 'Yilmaz, T', 'Sungur, A']","['Sarac S', 'Akyol MU', 'Kanbur B', 'Poyraz A', 'Akyol G', 'Yilmaz T', 'Sungur A']","['Hacettepe University Medical School, Department of Otolaryngology, Ankara, Turkey.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Otolaryngol,American journal of otolaryngology,8000029,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cytoskeletal Proteins)', '0 (Genetic Markers)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (LIM Domain Proteins)', '0 (PDLIM7 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Carcinoma/*genetics/mortality/*pathology', 'Carrier Proteins/*genetics', 'Child', 'Cytoskeletal Proteins', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes, bcl-2/*genetics', 'Genetic Markers/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'LIM Domain Proteins', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nasopharyngeal Neoplasms/*genetics/mortality/*pathology', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Probability', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sampling Studies', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Statistics, Nonparametric', 'Survival Analysis', 'Turkey']",2001/11/20 10:00,2002/01/10 10:01,['2001/11/20 10:00'],"['2001/11/20 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/10 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/20 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0196070901633611 [pii]', '10.1053/ajot.2001.28071 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Otolaryngol. 2001 Nov-Dec;22(6):377-82. doi: 10.1053/ajot.2001.28071.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Dendritic cells have been reported to be generated from cells in granulocytic lineage as well as monocytes, blood dendritic cell precursors and lymphoid progenitors. In order to explore the differentiation pathway of dendritic cells from granulocytic cells and the applicability of leukaemia-derived dendritic cells for anti-leukaemic immunotherapy in acute leukaemia of granulocytic origin, we tried to generate dendritic cells from leukaemia cells of a patient with acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL). Leukaemia cells were cultured with GM-CSF, IL-4 and TNF-alpha for 10 days. Azurophilic granule-containing cells with marked cytoplasmic projections were generated in the culture. FACS analysis of these cultured cells revealed the generation of CD1a+, CD83+, CD80+, CD86+, CD40+ and HLA-DR+ cells. The leukaemic origin of these dendritic-like cells was demonstrated by in situ hybridization of magnetic-bead-sorted CD1a+ dendritic cells using the DNA probes of t(15;17). Cells generated by culturing leukaemia cells were demonstrated to have a potent antigen-presenting function in allogeneic mixed leucocyte cultures. These findings show the plausibility of the previously reported pathway of dendritic cell maturation through granulocytic cells and suggest the possibility of anti-leukaemic immunotherapy using leukaemia-derived dendritic cells even in patients with acute promyelocytic leukaemia.","['Narita, M', 'Takahashi, M', 'Liu, A', 'Ayres, F', 'Satoh, N', 'Abe, T', 'Nikkuni, K', 'Furukawa, T', 'Toba, K', 'Aizawa, Y']","['Narita M', 'Takahashi M', 'Liu A', 'Ayres F', 'Satoh N', 'Abe T', 'Nikkuni K', 'Furukawa T', 'Toba K', 'Aizawa Y']","['School of Health Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, Niigata University, Niigata, Japan. naritami@clg.niigata-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Acta Haematol,Acta haematologica,0141053,"['0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antigen Presentation', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Lineage', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 15/ultrastructure', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17/ultrastructure', 'Dendritic Cells/*cytology/immunology', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Immunomagnetic Separation', 'Immunophenotyping', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Interleukin-4/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/genetics/*pathology', 'Lymphocyte Culture Test, Mixed', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/cytology/*drug effects', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*pharmacology']",2001/11/20 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/11/20 10:00'],"['2001/11/20 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/20 10:00 [entrez]']","['aha06089 [pii]', '10.1159/000046595 [doi]']",ppublish,Acta Haematol. 2001;106(3):89-94. doi: 10.1159/000046595.,"['Copyright 2001 S.

A potential involvement of Bcl-3 in oncogenesis is highlighted by the fact that it was cloned due to its location at a breakpoint junction in some cases of human B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia and that it is highly expressed in human breast tumor tissue. To analyze the effects of Bcl-3 dysregulation in breast epithelial cells, we created stable immortalized human breast epithelial cell lines either expressing Bcl-3 or carrying the corresponding vector control plasmid. Analysis of the Bcl-3-expressing cells suggests that these cells have a shortened G(1) phase of the cell cycle as well as a significant increase in hyperphosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein. Additionally, the cyclin D1 gene was found to be highly expressed in these cells. Upon further analysis, Bcl-3, acting as a coactivator with NF-kappaB p52 homodimers, was demonstrated to directly activate the cyclin D1 promoter through an NF-kappaB binding site. Therefore, our results demonstrate that dysregulated expression of Bcl-3 potentiates the G(1) transition of the cell cycle by stimulating the transcription of the cyclin D1 gene in human breast epithelial cells.","['Westerheide, S D', 'Mayo, M W', 'Anest, V', 'Hanson, J L', 'Baldwin, A S Jr']","['Westerheide SD', 'Mayo MW', 'Anest V', 'Hanson JL', 'Baldwin AS Jr']","['Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC 27599, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA073756/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA075080/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 73756/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 75080/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (B-Cell Lymphoma 3 Protein)', '0 (BCL3 protein, human)', '0 (Bcl3 protein, mouse)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'B-Cell Lymphoma 3 Protein', 'Binding Sites', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Western', 'Breast/metabolism', 'COS Cells', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cell Separation', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Cyclin D1/*metabolism', 'Epithelial Cells/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', '*G1 Phase', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/metabolism', 'Luciferases/metabolism', 'Mice', 'NF-kappa B/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Phosphorylation', 'Plasmids/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors', 'Transfection']",2001/11/20 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/11/20 10:00'],"['2001/11/20 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/20 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/MCB.21.24.8428-8436.2001 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2001 Dec;21(24):8428-36. doi: 10.1128/MCB.21.24.8428-8436.2001.,,,,,PMC100006,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DNA damage was evaluated as single strand breaks and 8-OHdG adducts, measured by single cell electrophoresis or by monoclonal antibodies, respectively. The basal levels of either marker of DNA damage were higher in undifferentiated HL-60 cells than in HPG and DMSO- or RA-differentiated cells. Treatment with H(2)O(2) increased 8-OHdG formation in all cells, but the levels of DNA damage remained higher in undifferentiated cells as compared to the differentiated ones. Three lines of evidence suggested that the higher levels of DNA damage observed in undifferentiated cells were at least in part attributable to a reduced detoxification of reactive oxygen species (ROS). First, undifferentiated cells were shown to accumulate higher levels of dichlorodihydrofluorescein-detectable ROS than HPG and DMSO- or RA-differentiated cells. Second, undifferentiated HL-60 cells were characterized by reduced levels of GSH and lower GSH/GSSG ratios as compared to the differentiated cells. Third, pretreatment of undifferentiated HL-60 cells with antioxidants such as alpha-tocopherol or beta-carotene suppressed the elevation of ROS and the formation of 8-OHdG induced by H(2)O(2). Further evidence for the importance of the oxidant/antioxidant balance was obtained by modulating the iron-catalyzed decomposition of H(2)O(2) to hydroxyl radicals in undifferentiated HL-60 cells. In fact, pretreatment with FeSO(4) increased the formation of 8-OHdG induced by H(2)O(2), whereas pretreatment with the iron chelator deferoxamine produced the opposite effect. These results illustrate correlations between the oxidant/antioxidant balance and DNA damage and suggest that the capability of a cell population to withstand oxidative stress and DNA damage may depend on its degree of differentiation.","['Covacci, V', 'Torsello, A', 'Palozza, P', 'Sgambato, A', 'Romano, G', 'Boninsegna, A', 'Cittadini, A', 'Wolf, F I']","['Covacci V', 'Torsello A', 'Palozza P', 'Sgambato A', 'Romano G', 'Boninsegna A', 'Cittadini A', 'Wolf FI']","['Institute of General Pathology and Giovanni XXIII Cancer Research Center, Faculty of Medicine, Catholic University of Sacred Heart, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Chem Res Toxicol,Chemical research in toxicology,8807448,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (DNA Adducts)', '0 (Free Radical Scavengers)', '0 (Oxidants)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Antioxidants', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Survival', '*DNA Adducts', '*DNA Damage', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Electrophoresis', 'Free Radical Scavengers/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/chemistry', 'Oxidants/chemistry', 'Oxidation-Reduction', '*Oxidative Stress', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'Tretinoin/*adverse effects']",2001/11/20 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/11/20 10:00'],"['2001/11/20 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/20 10:00 [entrez]']","['tx010021m [pii]', '10.1021/tx010021m [doi]']",ppublish,Chem Res Toxicol. 2001 Nov;14(11):1492-7. doi: 10.1021/tx010021m.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Parents were donors for nine, sibling for one patient. T-cell depletion of HSC was performed using CellPro followed by antiCD2/CD3 depletion in 7, and CliniMacs magnetic sorting in 3 grafts. Primary engraftment was achieved in nine patients. Patient with graft failure was successfully re-grafted. Primary acute GVHD was diagnosed in one patient who got higher amount of T-cells in the graft. Secondary GVHD was induced by add-backs of lymphocytes in four patients. Three patients developed chronic GVHD. Four patients died due to transplant related mortality (40%), one from veno-occlusive disease, two due to CMV pneumonia and one of aspergillosis with extensive chronic GVHD. Four patients relapsed with leukemia within 35-98 days post transplant, three without previous signs of GVHD, and all died. Two patients are alive and well 26 and 42 months after transplant.

We examined PB and/or BM samples on a series of 111 patients with immunophenotypically defined hematological malignancies at diagnosis, in remission and in relapsed disease comparing to 20 control samples of healthy individuals. p53 protein has been studied by flow cytometry using three monoclonal antibodies specific for epitopes on N-terminus (Bp53-12, DO-1) and central region (DO-11) of p53 protein. Our findigs showed, that p53 expression may contribute to phenotype of leukemic cells and that overexpression of this protein is often associated with progression of disease. All samples of early B-ALL patients and samples of patients with immunophenotypically defined T- cell disorders examined at diagnosis of disease were p53 positive. Eleven of 19 patient samples from AML at diagnosis showed also increased expression of p53 protein. The cells of all patients who responded to therapy with complete immunophenotypically defined remission were p53 negative. Relapsed T-, B- ALL and AML develop p53 alteration. We reported positive p53 expression in cells of patients with advanced stages of CLL in comparison to them with initial stage of disease at examination. As well as in the group of B- cell lymphomas only samples of patients with generalized FCC lymphoma at diagnosis were p53 positive. We detected p53 positive cells in immunologically defined myeloid blast crisis of CML opposite to p53 negativity in chronic phase of disease. The finding of p53 positive BM cells without immunophenotypic blast markers in two of followed cases documented the contributing value of p53 detection in their characterization. On the basis of above findings we conclude, that cytofluorometric determination of p53 expression may contribute to the better definition of leukemic phenotype. Loss of the normal p53 function may be important in the genesis of some leukemias.

It was demonstrated that rapidly developing cancer is a considerable stress, which is proved by the increase in the neurohormonal axis activity in comparison to the control groups. The activity of the hypothalamo-adrenal axis was typical for a stress reaction: a two-phase process with a considerable increase in activity in the introductory phase of the developing leukemia and a visible decrease in the last phase, typical for an unspecific reaction, where no more effective mobilization for adaptation and activation of mechanisms is possible.

Two amino acid changes from F-MuLV in the putative receptor binding domain (RBD) of the envelope surface protein of PVC-211 MuLV (Glu-116 to Gly and Glu-129 to Lys) were shown to be sufficient for conferring BCEC tropism on PVC-211 MuLV. Recent examination of the unique RBD of PVC-211 MuLV revealed that the substitution of Lys for Glu at position 129 created a new heparin-binding domain that overlapped a heparin-binding domain common to ecotropic MuLVs. In this study we used heparin-Sepharose columns to demonstrate that PVC-211 MuLV, but not F-MuLV, can bind efficiently to heparin and that one or both of the amino acids in the RBD of PVC-211 MuLV that are associated with BCEC tropism are responsible. We further showed that heparin can enhance or inhibit MuLV infection and that the mode of action is dependent on heparin concentration, sulfation of heparin, and the affinity of the virus for heparin. Our results suggest that the amino acid changes that occurred in the envelope surface protein of PVC-211 MuLV may allow the virus to bind strongly to the surface of BCEC via heparin-like molecules, increasing the probability that the virus will bind to its cell surface receptor and efficiently infect these cells.","['Jinno-Oue, A', 'Oue, M', 'Ruscetti, S K']","['Jinno-Oue A', 'Oue M', 'Ruscetti SK']","['Basic Research Laboratory, National Cancer Institute-Frederick, Frederick, Maryland 21702-1201, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '9005-49-6 (Heparin)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Brain/*virology', 'Capillaries/virology', 'Endothelium, Vascular/*virology', 'Heparin/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/drug effects/*physiology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Rats', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*chemistry/physiology']",2001/11/17 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/11/17 10:00'],"['2001/11/17 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/17 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.75.24.12439-12445.2001 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2001 Dec;75(24):12439-45. doi: 10.1128/JVI.75.24.12439-12445.2001.,,,,,PMC116140,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In benign lesions induced by the small DNA tumor viruses, viral genomes are typically maintained extrachromosomally. Malignant progression is often associated with viral integration into host cell chromatin. To study the role of viral integration in tumorigenesis, we analyzed the positions of integrated viral genomes in tumors and tumor cell lines induced by the small oncogenic viruses, including the high-risk human papillomaviruses, hepatitis B virus, simian virus 40, and human T-cell leukemia virus type 1. We show that viral integrations in tumor cells lie near cellular sequences identified as nuclear matrix attachment regions (MARs), while integrations in nonneoplastic cells show no significant correlation with these regions. In mammalian cells, the nuclear matrix functions in gene expression and DNA replication. MARs play varied but poorly understood roles in eukaryotic gene expression. Our results suggest that integrated tumor virus genomes are subject to MAR-mediated transcriptional regulation, providing insight into mechanisms of viral carcinogenesis. Furthermore, the viral oncoproteins serve as invaluable tools for the study of mechanisms controlling cellular growth. Similarly, our demonstration that integrated viral genomes may be subject to MAR-mediated transcriptional effects should facilitate elucidation of fundamental mechanisms regulating eukaryotic gene expression.","['Shera, K A', 'Shera, C A', 'McDougall, J K']","['Shera KA', 'Shera CA', 'McDougall JK']","['Cancer Biology Program, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington 98109-1024, USA.']",['eng'],"['P01 CA042792/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DC003687/DC/NIDCD NIH HHS/United States', 'CA42792/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DC03687/DC/NIDCD NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,,IM,"['*Attachment Sites, Microbiological', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Female', '*Genome, Viral', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics', 'Humans', 'Nuclear Matrix/*virology', 'Oncogenic Viruses/*genetics', 'Papillomaviridae', 'Proviruses/genetics', 'Simian virus 40/genetics', '*Virus Integration']",2001/11/17 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/11/17 10:00'],"['2001/11/17 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/17 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.75.24.12339-12346.2001 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2001 Dec;75(24):12339-46. doi: 10.1128/JVI.75.24.12339-12346.2001.,,,,,PMC116130,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One of these activities is the ability to enhance infectivity and the formation of proviral DNA. The mechanism of this enhancement remains incompletely understood. We show that virions with nef deleted can be restored to wild-type infectivity by stimulating intravirion reverse transcription. Particle composition and measures of reverse transcriptase activity remain the same for Nef(+) and Nef(-) virions both before and after natural endogenous reverse transcription (NERT) treatment. The effect of NERT treatment on virions pseudotyped with murine leukemia virus envelope protein was similar to that on particles pseudotyped with HIV-1 envelope protein. However, virions pseudotyped with vesicular stomatitis virus G envelope protein showed no influence of Nef on NERT enhancement of infectivity. These observations suggest that Nef may function at a level prior to reverse transcription. Since NERT treatment results in partial disassembly of the viral core, we speculate that Nef may function at the level of core particle disassembly.","['Khan, M', 'Garcia-Barrio, M', 'Powell, M D']","['Khan M', 'Garcia-Barrio M', 'Powell MD']","['Department of Microbiology/Biochemistry/Immunology, Morehouse School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia 30310, USA.']",['eng'],"['G-12-RR03034/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'G12 RR003034/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'S06 GM008248/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'S-06-GM08248/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'K22-HD-1228/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Gene Products, nef)', '0 (nef Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (HIV Reverse Transcriptase)']",IM,"['DNA, Viral/biosynthesis', 'Gene Products, nef/*physiology', 'HIV Reverse Transcriptase/metabolism', 'HIV-1/*genetics/pathogenicity', 'Proviruses/genetics', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Virion/physiology', 'nef Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus']",2001/11/17 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/11/17 10:00'],"['2001/11/17 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/17 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.75.24.12081-12087.2001 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2001 Dec;75(24):12081-7. doi: 10.1128/JVI.75.24.12081-12087.2001.,,,,,PMC116103,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Subsequent administration of a prodrug substrate of the enzyme leads to the enzyme-catalyzed release of the free drug at the tumor site. The free drug will destroy the tumor cells selectively, thus, reducing side effects. RESULTS: A CC-1065 analogue was conjugated to a cephalosporin affording prodrug 2. The prodrug and its corresponding free drug, 1, have IC50 values of 0.9 and 0.09 nM, respectively, against U937 leukemia cells in vitro. CONCLUSIONS: For the first time, a prodrug comprised of a cephalosporin and a CC-1065 analogue has been synthesized. The preliminary in vitro studies show that the prodrug was 10-fold less toxic than the free drug. Prodrug 2 has the potential to be useful in cancer treatment using the ADEPT approach.","['Wang, Yuqiang', 'Yuan, Huiling', 'Wright, Susan C', 'Wang, Hong', 'Larrick, James W']","['Wang Y', 'Yuan H', 'Wright SC', 'Wang H', 'Larrick JW']","['Panorama Research, Inc, 2462 Wyandotte Stree, Mountain View, California, 94043, USA. yugiangwang2001@yahoo.com']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,BMC Chem Biol,BMC chemical biology,101088664,,,,2001/11/17 10:00,2001/11/17 10:01,['2001/11/17 10:00'],"['2001/10/08 00:00 [received]', '2001/11/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2001/11/17 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/11/17 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/17 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1186/1472-6769-1-4 [doi]'],ppublish,BMC Chem Biol. 2001;1(1):4. doi: 10.1186/1472-6769-1-4.,,,,,PMC59845,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Activation (initiation of expression) of the TCL1 locus at chromosome 14q32.1 appears to be the causal event in the pathogenesis of these mature T-cell leukemias. This activation occurs as a result of translocations or inversions that cause rearrangement of the TCL1 (T-cell leukemia/lymphoma 1) locus with regulatory elements of T-cell receptor genes. To describe the molecular events that take part in the leukemogenesis of mature T-cell leukemias, we reviewed the literature and our own data on the molecular basis of mature T-cell leukemia. This data search revealed that 4 genes have been identified at the TCL1 locus: TCL1, TCL1b, TNG1, and TNG2. The expression of these genes is substantially increased following rearrangements involving 14q32.1. Functional analysis of the Tcl1 protein revealed its involvement in an Akt (protein kinase B) prosurvival pathway through its interaction with the Akt kinase, which promotes translocation of Akt to the nucleus and increases Akt's enzymatic activity. The available data provide important insights into the molecular mechanisms of T-cell leukemogenesis that may lead to the development of new drugs for treatment of mature T-cell leukemia.","['Pekarsky, Y', 'Hallas, C', 'Croce, C M']","['Pekarsky Y', 'Hallas C', 'Croce CM']","['Kimmel Cancer Center, 233 S 10th St, BLSB Room 1050, Philadelphia, PA 19107, USA.']",['eng'],"['CA 56036/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 76259/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 77738/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,JAMA,JAMA,7501160,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (NR4A1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 4, Group A, Member 1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear)', '0 (Receptors, Steroid)', '0 (TCL1A protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (AKT1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",IM,"['Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Chromosome Inversion', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/physiology', 'Gene Expression', '*Gene Rearrangement, T-Lymphocyte', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*genetics', 'Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 4, Group A, Member 1', '*Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear', 'Receptors, Steroid', 'Transcription Factors/physiology', 'Translocation, Genetic']",2001/11/17 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/11/17 10:00'],"['2001/11/17 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/17 10:00 [entrez]']","['jsc10274 [pii]', '10.1001/jama.286.18.2308 [doi]']",ppublish,JAMA. 2001 Nov 14;286(18):2308-14. doi: 10.1001/jama.286.18.2308.,,55,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, 2 methyl-CpG-binding domain proteins have been linked to gene inactivation by their ability to recruit co-repressors and HDAC-activity to methylated gene promoters. Here, we have analysed mRNA expression of these genes, MeCP2 and MBD2, in a wide variety of primary human tumours. In solid tumours, expression levels of MBD2 (57/71) and MeCP2 (64/71) were significantly reduced in the majority of primary tumours as detected by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. Western blot analyses of MeCP2 in matched tumour-normal samples of patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) indicated reduced protein in a significant percentage of patients. In acute myelogenous leukaemia (n = 26), expression levels were only slightly reduced and did not differ between samples analysed at diagnosis or at the time of relapse. In early-stage NSCLC (n = 70) expression of MeCP2 and MBD2 was significantly lower in squamous cell carcinoma than in adenocarcinoma or large cell carcinoma (P = 0.03 and P = 0.01). To further elucidate the mechanisms of gene regulation, we analysed MeCP2 and MBD2 regulation during haematopoietic differentiation. No significant changes in MeCP2 or MBD2 expression were found when NB4 cells were differentiated toward granulocytes suggesting that neither differentiation nor cell cycle status were relevant for the reduced expression of these genes in human cancer. In conclusion, the significant loss of MeCP2 and MBD2 expression in human cancers suggests a potential role of this phenomenon in the development of solid human tumours.","['Muller-Tidow, C', 'Kugler, K', 'Diederichs, S', 'Klumpen, S', 'Moller, M', 'Vogt, U', 'Metzger, R', 'Schneider, P M', 'Berdel, W E', 'Serve, H']","['Muller-Tidow C', 'Kugler K', 'Diederichs S', 'Klumpen S', 'Moller M', 'Vogt U', 'Metzger R', 'Schneider PM', 'Berdel WE', 'Serve H']","['Department of Medicine, Hematology and Oncology, University of Munster, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Dinucleoside Phosphates)', '0 (MBD2 protein)', '0 (MECP2 protein, human)', '0 (Methyl-CpG-Binding Protein 2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', ""2382-65-2 (cytidylyl-3'-5'-guanosine)"", 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation', '*Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Dinucleoside Phosphates/metabolism', 'Histone Deacetylases/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism', 'Methyl-CpG-Binding Protein 2', 'Neoplasms/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/*analysis', '*Repressor Proteins']",2001/11/17 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/11/17 10:00'],"['2001/11/17 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/17 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1054/bjoc.2001.2041 [doi]', 'S0007092001920415 [pii]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 2001 Oct 19;85(8):1168-74. doi: 10.1054/bjoc.2001.2041.,['Copyright 2001 Cancer Research Campaign http://www.bjcancer.com.'],,,,PMC2375156,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS AND RESULTS: Of C57B1/6 mice injected with 10(6) Lewis lung cancer (3LL) cells followed by treatment with a single 50 mg/kg dose of etoposide (VP-16), 60% survived over 60 days, in contrast to untreated control mice which died within 30 days. Approximately 40% of surviving mice rejected a subsequent challenge with 3LL. Their splenocytes protected naive mice injected with 3LL. To test if VP-16 treatment produced alterations in 3LL cells, which induce host immunity, leading to tumor rejection, C57B1/6 mice were injected with 3LL cells that had survived an 80-90% lethal concentration of VP-16 in vitro. These cells killed 75% of recipient mice but 60% of the surviving mice rejected challenge with 3LL. Splenocytes harvested from tumor-rejecting mice protected naive mice injected with 3LL. CONCLUSION: These results support the hypothesis that in addition to its antineoplastic cytotoxic effect, VP-16 induces changes in 3LL cells which are recognized by the host immune system resulting in immune rejection of 3LL. often immunosuppressive and therapeutic advantage is generally based on the tumor cytotoxicity of individual drugs or combinations of drugs [13]. Our earlier work showed a link between the use of cytotoxic chemotherapy with etoposide (VP-16) and the induction of an immune response against syngeneic murine leukemia in the intact host [16]. VP-16 is an immunosuppressive topoisomerase II-inhibiting drug which induces tumor cell apoptosis and is frequently used clinically to treat a variety of tumors [1, 3, 9, 10]. We have noted that the addition of cyclosporin A to VP-16 produces CD8 T lymphocyte-mediated tumor-specific immunity in mice bearing L1210 leukemia [17]. We have extended these experiments to a spontaneously arising non-carcinogen-induced neoplasm, Lewis lung cancer (3LL), and now report that surviving mice successfully treated with VP-16, in the absence of cyclosporin A, reject challenge with 3LL. In addition, results are presented to show that VP-16 modifies 3LL cells rendering them immunogenic. These findings are submitted to support the hypothesis that VP-16-induced cytotoxic changes include cellular membrane alterations in 3LL cells which are recognized by the immune system and cause rejection of this syngeneic lung tumor.","['Slater, L M', 'Stupecky, M', 'Sweet, P', 'Osann, K', 'Eklof, A', 'Arquilla, E R']","['Slater LM', 'Stupecky M', 'Sweet P', 'Osann K', 'Eklof A', 'Arquilla ER']","['Department of Medicine, University of California, Irvine 92697-1875, USA']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Carcinoma, Lewis Lung/*drug therapy/*immunology/pathology', 'Cell Membrane/immunology', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Etoposide/*pharmacology', 'Graft Rejection', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Cellular/*drug effects', 'Immunoglobulin G/analysis', 'Lung Neoplasms/*drug therapy/*immunology/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Spleen/cytology', 'Transplantation, Heterologous']",2001/11/17 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/11/17 10:00'],"['2001/11/17 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/17 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s002800100357 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2001 Oct;48(4):327-32. doi: 10.1007/s002800100357.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The mRNA expression of MDZF in tissues and cells was analyzed by Northern blot and RT-PCR. Polyclonal antibodies against the N terminus of MDZF were used to analyze protein expression in hematopoietic cell lines and subcellular location of MDZF in promyelocytic NB4 cells. The NB4 cells treated with TPA or ATRA at different intervals were harvested and then the expression level of MDZF protein was determined by Western blot. RESULT: A full-length cDNA was successfully identified from a human monocyte-derived dendritic cell cDNA library which encodes 610 amino acids with eight C2H2 zinc finger motifs and one POZ domain. It was located on chromosome 3 according to the genome database. This novel zinc finger protein was designated as MDZF. One transcript isoform of MDZF was also cloned by RT-PCR. Northern blot showed that MDZF mRNA was restrictedly expressed in heart, skeleton muscle, kidney, liver, and placenta. MDZF protein was expressed in all hematopoietic cell lines examined. Immunoblotting and confocal analysis indicated a dominant cytoplasmic location of MDZF in NB4 cells. Furthermore, after NB4 cells were treated with TPA for 48 h and differentiated into monocytes, MDZF expression increased fivefold in the NB4 cells, but no effect was observed in NB4 cells treated with ATRA. CONCLUSION: A novel zinc finger protein MDZF was cloned. MDZF is upregulated in monocytic, but not granulocytic, differentiation of NB4 acute promyelocytic leukemia cells.

They are characterized by anemia, and it has been attributed either to a deficiency in erythropoietin (EPO) secretion or to a resistance to EPO itself. Since in healthy subjects the serum circulating EPO levels fluctuate during the day, the aim of the study was to investigate the diurnal rhythm of EPO in MDS. Two groups of subjects were admitted to the study: (A) 20 adult clinically healthy subjects, and (B) 20 patients with MDS without renal failure. After standard life conditions in hospital lasting one week, venous blood samples were drawn during the span of a whole day and every four hours, starting from midnight, for the measurement of serum EPO levels by RIA. Statistical analysis was carried out by means of the ""cosinor"" method. The results show that the controls present a significant (p < 0.05) circadian rhythms in serum EPO levels with acrophase in the late afternoon; on the contrary, no significant (p > 0.05) rhythm was detected in patients with MDS. Patients with MDS presented significantly higher (p < 0.05) MESOR and lower (p < 0.001) amplitude of EPO circadian rhythm in respect to the controls; moreover, a significant (p < 0.005) difference was found between the two groups in overall EPO rhythm. These data confirm the existence of a physiological circadian rhythm in serum EPO concentrations with maximum in the afternoon. Because EPO levels are increased in the patient group, EPO deficiency does not seem to be the cause of anemia in MDS. Reduced EPO amplitude may be a compensatory mechanism for enhancing its activity in MDS. Finally, the stimulatory therapy in MDS with recombinant human EPO should be administered in the late afternoon hours, in order to respecting and simulating the physiological circadian rhythm of endogenous EPO.","['Pasqualetti, P', 'Collacciani, A', 'Casale, R']","['Pasqualetti P', 'Collacciani A', 'Casale R']","[""Department of Internal Medicine and Public Health, Faculty of Medicine and Surgery, University of L'Aquila and S.

The maximum activity was for 13.5-d postcoitum embryos. Specific antibody against AKI inhibited 81% of GlcNAc betaGalT activities, which indicates that AKI represents the major part of the embryonic epidermis enzymes. AKI shows 2.2 times higher galactosyltransferase activity toward Gal-acceptor glucose with alpha-lactalbumin (alpha-LA) than toward GlcNAc without alpha-LA.

In the case of L6 BCR-ABL b2a2 mRNA, it is difficult to cleave the abnormal mRNA specifically because the mRNA includes no sequences that can be cleaved efficiently by conventional hammerhead ribozymes near the BCR-ABL junction. We recently succeeded in designing a novel maxizyme, which specifically cleaves BCR-ABL fusion mRNA, as a result of the formation of a dimeric structure [Kuwabara, T.; et al. Mol. Cell 1998, 2, 617-627; Tanabe, T.; et al. Nature 2000, 406, 473-474]. Specifically, we tailored the maxizyme with molecular switching function: the maxizyme splices a cleavable GUC site, but only when it appears within a strand of mRNA that possesses the abnormal splice junction. We demonstrated that this approach is generalizable [Tanabe, T.; et al. Biomacromolecules 2000, 1, 108-117]. All the maxizymes designed in the past functioned as a result of the formation of a dimeric structure. Questions have been asked whether a similar molecular switching might be possible within a single molecule when two monomer units of the maxizyme were connected via a linker sequence. We found that an analogous conformational change could not be induced within a single molecule when two maxizyme units were simply connected via a nonregulatable linker sequence. However, an active conformation was achieved by the introduction of an antisense modulator within the linker sequence that adjusted the overall structure to the correct form. Results of studies in cultured cells suggested that the desired conformational change could indeed be induced within the modified single-chained maxizyme and such a construct caused apoptosis only in leukemic cells with the Philadelphia chromosome.","['Kuwabara, T', 'Hamada, M', 'Warashina, M', 'Taira, K']","['Kuwabara T', 'Hamada M', 'Warashina M', 'Taira K']","['Gene Discovery Research Center, National Institute of Advanced Intdustrial Science and Technology (AIST), 1-1-4 Higashi, Tsukuba Science City 305-8562, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Biomacromolecules,Biomacromolecules,100892849,"['0 (RNA, Catalytic)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (RNA, Transfer, Val)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Allosteric Regulation', 'Base Sequence', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Drug Design', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Genes, abl', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nucleic Acid Conformation', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA, Catalytic/*chemistry/genetics/*metabolism/therapeutic use', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'RNA, Transfer, Val/genetics', 'Transduction, Genetic']",2001/11/17 10:00,2002/01/23 10:01,['2001/11/17 10:00'],"['2001/11/17 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/23 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/17 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/bm010054g [doi]'],ppublish,Biomacromolecules. 2001 Fall;2(3):788-99. doi: 10.1021/bm010054g.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus, to demonstrate the general applicability of maxizyme technology, we constructed maxizymes targeted to other mRNAs, such as PML-RAR alpha mRNA, sDLST mRNA, and BCR-ABL (b1a2) mRNA, that are not cleaved with high specificity by the wild-type hammerhead ribozyme. Specific and efficient cleavage in vitro of these mRNAs by the custom-designed maxizymes demonstrated clearly that maxizyme technology is not limited to a specific case but may have broad general applicability in molecular biology and, also, in a clinical setting.","['Tanabe, T', 'Takata, I', 'Kuwabara, T', 'Warashina, M', 'Kawasaki, H', 'Tani, K', 'Ohta, S', 'Asano, S', 'Taira, K']","['Tanabe T', 'Takata I', 'Kuwabara T', 'Warashina M', 'Kawasaki H', 'Tani K', 'Ohta S', 'Asano S', 'Taira K']","['Department of Hepatology/Oncology, Institute of Medical Science, University of Tokyo, Minato-ku, Tokyo 108-8539.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Biomacromolecules,Biomacromolecules,100892849,"['0 (Cytoskeletal Proteins)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Catalytic)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP Phosphohydrolases)']",IM,"['Autoradiography', '*Cytoskeletal Proteins', 'GTP Phosphohydrolases/chemistry', 'Molecular Biology', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/chemistry', 'Nucleic Acid Conformation', 'Protein Conformation', 'RNA/chemical synthesis', 'RNA, Catalytic/*chemistry', 'Substrate Specificity']",2001/11/17 10:00,2002/01/18 10:01,['2001/11/17 10:00'],"['2001/11/17 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/18 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/17 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/bm990009x [doi]'],ppublish,Biomacromolecules. 2000 Spring;1(1):108-17. doi: 10.1021/bm990009x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Waldeyer's ring is the most common site of lymphomas involving the oral region. The purpose of this study was to review the characteristics of a large series of malignant lymphoma of the oral region. METHODS: Three hundred sixty-one consecutive cases of malignant lymphoma of the oral region were identified in the Tumor Registry between 1969 and 1998. RESULTS: The 361 cases (200 males and 161 females) of malignant lymphoma of the oral region accounted for 3.5% of all oral malignancies. The mean age was 62.5 years and the most prevalent site of involvement was the tonsil (32.7%), followed by the parotid gland (16.1%). Sixty-five percent of the lesions were diagnosed as large-cell (38%) or small-cell (27%) lymphoma. One quarter of the patients died of the disease in a mean of 2.78 years after diagnosis. Of a total 26 patients who died from other causes, 12 died because of other cancers, including 7 (27%) with leukemia and 5 (19%) with oral carcinoma. The prognosis is based, at least partially, on the histologic grading (low, intermediate, or high) and the anatomic stage of the disease. Localized low-grade lymphomas have a more favorable prognosis compared with those that are disseminated and/or have high-grade cellular changes. CONCLUSION: Lymphoma is the second most common malignant oral disease. Thorough head and neck and oral examination is necessary to identify lesions that may represent lymphoma.","['Epstein, J B', 'Epstein, J D', 'Le, N D', 'Gorsky, M']","['Epstein JB', 'Epstein JD', 'Le ND', 'Gorsky M']","['Department of Dentistry, British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver, Canada. jepstein@bccancer.bc.ca']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Oral Surg Oral Med Oral Pathol Oral Radiol Endod,"Oral surgery, oral medicine, oral pathology, oral radiology, and endodontics",9508562,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'British Columbia/epidemiology', 'Carcinoma/epidemiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Head and Neck Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/epidemiology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/epidemiology', 'Lymphoma/*epidemiology', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/epidemiology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mouth Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/epidemiology', 'Parotid Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Population Surveillance', 'Prognosis', 'Registries', 'Survival Rate', 'Tonsillar Neoplasms/epidemiology']",2001/12/26 10:00,2002/01/23 10:01,['2001/12/26 10:00'],"['2001/12/26 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/23 10:01 [medline]', '2001/12/26 10:00 [entrez]']","['S1079-2104(01)94436-1 [pii]', '10.1067/moe.2001.116062 [doi]']",ppublish,Oral Surg Oral Med Oral Pathol Oral Radiol Endod. 2001 Nov;92(5):519-25. doi: 10.1067/moe.2001.116062.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Reference to an historical group of patients treated with the intravenous (IV) formulation allowed the investigators to compare the two formulations. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Efficacy was assessed using the International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (IWCLL) and National Cancer Institute (NCI) criteria for complete remission (CR), partial remission (PR), stable disease, or disease progression. Safety monitoring included World Health Organization (WHO) toxicity grading for all adverse events. RESULTS: Seventy-eight (96.3%) of 81 recruited patients with previously treated B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) received 10-mg tablets of fludarabine phosphate to a dose of 40 mg/m(2)/d for 5 days, repeated every 4 weeks, for a total of six to eight cycles. According to IWCLL criteria, the overall remission rate was 46.2% (CR, 20.5%; PR, 25.6%). The comparative figures using NCI criteria were 51.3% (CR, 17.9%; PR, 33.3%). Overall, 30 incidents of severe adverse events were reported for 22 patients. WHO grade 3 or grade 4 hematologic toxicities included granulocytopenia (53.8%), leukocytopenia (28.2%), thrombocytopenia (25.6%), and anemia (24.4%). Gastrointestinal adverse events were more common with the oral formulation than previously reported with IV fludarabine phosphate. However, these events were generally mild to moderate. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that oral fludarabine phosphate has similar clinical efficacy to the IV formulation and a safety profile that is both predictable and essentially similar to that of the IV formulation.","['Boogaerts, M A', 'Van Hoof, A', 'Catovsky, D', 'Kovacs, M', 'Montillo, M', 'Zinzani, P L', 'Binet, J L', 'Feremans, W', 'Marcus, R', 'Bosch, F', 'Verhoef, G', 'Klein, M']","['Boogaerts MA', 'Van Hoof A', 'Catovsky D', 'Kovacs M', 'Montillo M', 'Zinzani PL', 'Binet JL', 'Feremans W', 'Marcus R', 'Bosch F', 'Verhoef G', 'Klein M']","['Department of Hematology, University Hospital, U.Z.

The functional significance of its subcellular compartmentalization, however, remains to be elucidated. Here, we define a Pro-Glu-Asp-Ser-Thr-rich element containing 129 amino acid residues, designated IR1+2, on the human nucleoporin RanBP2/Nup358, which binds directly to Ubc9 with high affinity both in vitro and in vivo. When IR1+2 tagged with green fluorescence protein at its amino terminus (GFP-IR1+2) was transfected into COS-7 cells, we found that approximately 90% of the nuclear Ubc9 was sequestered in the cytoplasm. We also observed that both SUMO-1 and SUMO-2/3 were mislocalized, and promyelocytic leukemia protein PML formed an enlarged aggregate in the nucleus. Moreover, the homologous recombination protein Rad51 mislocalized to the cytoplasm, and Rad51 foci, a hallmark of functional association of Rad51 with damaged DNA, did not form efficiently even in the presence of a DNA strand breaker. These findings emphasize that the IR1+2 domain is a useful tool for manipulating the nuclear localization of Ubc9 and perturbing the subcellular localization of SUMOs and/or SUMOlated proteins, and they emphasize the important role of nuclear Ubc9 in the Rad51-mediated homologous recombination pathway, possibly by modulating intracellular trafficking of Rad51.","['Saitoh, Hisato', 'Pizzi, Maryann Delli', 'Wang, Jian']","['Saitoh H', 'Pizzi MD', 'Wang J']","['The Picower Institute for Medical Research, Manhasset, New York 11030, USA. hisaito@molbiol.med.kyushu-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '0 (Molecular Chaperones)', '0 (Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Small Ubiquitin-Related Modifier Proteins)', '0 (Xenopus Proteins)', '0 (ran-binding protein 2)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', '50SG953SK6 (Mitomycin)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'EC 2.3.2.23 (Ubiquitin-Conjugating Enzymes)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (RAD51 protein, Xenopus)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (RAD51 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Rad51 Recombinase)', 'EC 6.- (Ligases)', 'EC 6.3.2.- (ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBC9)']",IM,"['Active Transport, Cell Nucleus', 'Amino Acid Motifs', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'COS Cells', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cricetinae', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique, Indirect', 'Glutathione Transferase/metabolism', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'Humans', 'Ligases/*chemistry/*metabolism', 'Luminescent Proteins/metabolism', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Mitomycin/pharmacology', 'Molecular Chaperones', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins/*chemistry/*metabolism', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Protein Transport', 'Rad51 Recombinase', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Recombination, Genetic', 'Small Ubiquitin-Related Modifier Proteins/*metabolism', 'Transfection', '*Ubiquitin-Conjugating Enzymes', 'Xenopus', 'Xenopus Proteins']",2001/11/16 10:00,2002/03/22 10:01,['2001/11/16 10:00'],"['2001/11/16 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/22 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/16 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M104453200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)82495-X [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2002 Feb 15;277(7):4755-63. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M104453200.

To identify the molecular basis for this, the gene expression profiles in uterus and ovary and for comparison, liver and kidney, from non-transgenic (NT) and SSAT transgenic (ST) mice were compared. The mRNA abundance for lipoprotein lipase and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was elevated in all four ST (>NT) tissues. The translation initiation factor-3 subunit 5 mRNA, and transcripts related to endogenous murine leukemia provirus (MLV-related) and murine retrovirus-related sequences (MuRRS) were decreased in ST tissues. A novel calmodulin-related mRNA was strongly induced in ST liver and kidney. SSAT overexpression was associated with increased levels of IGF-binding protein-2 (IGFBP-2) in the uterus and ovary, and a reduction in IGFBP-3 mRNA levels in the uterus. Exogenous spermidine and spermine elevated endogenous IGFBP-2 and SSAT mRNA abundance, whereas, putrescine stimulated IGFBP-2 mRNA abundance and transfected IGFBP-2 gene promoter activity in human (Hec-1-A) uterine cells. Sp1 and BTEB1 mRNAs that encode transcription factors for the IGFBP-2 gene also were induced in some ST tissues.

METHODS: Risk estimates were derived by applying cross-sectional population-based incidence rates of cancer and mortality rates from other causes to a hypothetical cohort. The cohort was aged through a double decrement life table to determine the expected proportion of the population that would develop the disease. RESULTS: Despite black men having higher invasive cancer incidence rates than white men, and black and white women having similar rates, because of the better life expectancy among whites lifetime risk estimates of developing cancer are higher for whites than blacks: 45.5% in white men, 40.4% in black men, 39.2% in white women, and 32.4% in black women based on 1995-97 data. White men experience higher 10-year cancer risk than black men in only bladder cancer, non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL), and leukemia. White women tended to show a greater risk than black women for cancers of the breast, corpus uteri, ovary, NHL, and leukemia. For both whites and blacks, the 10-year risk of lung cancer ranks first among men aged 40, ranks second to prostate cancer for men aged 50, 60, and 70, and ranks second to breast cancer for women aged 40, 50, 60, and 70. CONCLUSIONS: Lifetime and age-conditional risk measures reflect both changes in the disease incidence rates and age distribution over calendar time such that they are useful for monitoring the disease burden in the population. Even if cancer rates remain stable or fall, it is possible for the cancer burden, as reflected by lifetime and age-conditional risk estimates, to increase due to the aging population.","['Merrill, R M', 'Weed, D L']","['Merrill RM', 'Weed DL']","['Department of Health Science, College of Health and Human Performance, Brigham Young University, Provo, UT 84602, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Ann Epidemiol,Annals of epidemiology,9100013,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'African Americans/*statistics & numerical data', 'Age Distribution', 'Age of Onset', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cause of Death', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cost of Illness', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Life Expectancy/*ethnology', 'Life Tables', 'Male', 'Mass Screening', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology/ethnology/mortality', 'Public Health', 'Risk Factors', 'SEER Program', 'Sex Distribution', 'United States/epidemiology', 'Whites/*statistics & numerical data']",2001/11/16 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/11/16 10:00'],"['2001/11/16 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/16 10:00 [entrez]']","['S104727970100254X [pii]', '10.1016/s1047-2797(01)00254-x [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Epidemiol. 2001 Nov;11(8):547-53. doi: 10.1016/s1047-2797(01)00254-x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Transferrin receptors (TfR) in K562 cells are able to bind Tf, when carrying either iron (Fe) or Al, with similar affinity. Then, the aim of this work was to determine whether Al could interfere with the cellular Fe uptake and utilisation. K562 cells were induced to erythroid differentiation by either haemin (H) or sodium butyrate (B) and cultured with and without Al. The effect of Al on cellular Fe uptake, Fe incorporation to haem and cell differentiation was studied. H- and B-stimulated cells grown in the presence of 10 microM Al showed a reduction in the number of haemoglobinised cells (by 18% and 56%, respectively) and high amounts of Al content. Al(2)Tf inhibited both the (59)Fe cellular uptake and its utilisation for haem synthesis. The removal of Al during the (59)Fe pulse, after a previous incubation with the metal, allowed the cells to acquire Fe quantities in the normal range or even exceeding the amounts incorporated by the respective control cells. However, the Fe incorporated to haem could not reach control values in B-stimulated cells despite enough Fe acquisition was observed after removing Al. Present results suggest that Al might exert either reversible or irreversible effects on the haemoglobin synthesis depending on cellular conditions.","['Perez, G', 'Garbossa, G', 'Di Risio, C', 'Vittori, D', 'Nesse, A']","['Perez G', 'Garbossa G', 'Di Risio C', 'Vittori D', 'Nesse A']","['Laboratorio de Analisis Biologicos, Departamento de Quimica Biologica, Facultad de Ciencias Exactas y Naturales, Universidad de Buenos Aires, Ciudad Universitaria, Pabellon II, Piso 4, 1428 Buenos Aires, Argentina.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Inorg Biochem,Journal of inorganic biochemistry,7905788,"['0 (Apoproteins)', '0 (Barbiturates)', '0 (Hemoglobins)', '0 (Radioisotopes)', '0 (Transferrin)', '0 (apotransferrin)', '42VZT0U6YR (Heme)', '743LRP9S7N (Hemin)', 'CPD4NFA903 (Aluminum)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)', 'WQ92Y2793G (barbituric acid)']",IM,"['Aluminum/analysis/*pharmacology', 'Apoproteins/metabolism', 'Barbiturates/pharmacology', 'Biological Transport/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Heme/metabolism', 'Hemin/pharmacology', 'Hemoglobins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Iron/*metabolism', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Radioisotopes', 'Transferrin/metabolism']",2001/11/16 10:00,2002/02/07 10:01,['2001/11/16 10:00'],"['2001/11/16 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/02/07 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/16 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0162-0134(01)00310-5 [pii]', '10.1016/s0162-0134(01)00310-5 [doi]']",ppublish,J Inorg Biochem. 2001 Nov;87(1-2):21-7. doi: 10.1016/s0162-0134(01)00310-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The apoptotic induction seems to be independent of the mitochondrial peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor (PBR), which binds these PBOXs with high affinity, due to a lack of correlation between their affinities for the receptor and their apoptotic potencies and their high apoptotic activity in PBR-deficient cells. PBOX-6, a potent member of the series, induces a transient activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) in a dose-dependent manner, which correlates with induction of apoptosis. Expression of a cytoplasmic inhibitor of the JNK signal transduction pathway, Jip-1, prevents JNK activity and significantly reduces the extent of apoptosis induced by PBOX-6. This demonstrates the requirement for JNK in the cellular response to this apoptotic agent. In addition, PBOX-6 activates caspase-3-like proteases in K562 and HL-60 cells. The caspase-3 inhibitor, Z-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-fluoromethylketone (z-DEVD-fmk), blocks caspase-3-like protease activity in both cell types but only prevents PBOX-6-induced apoptosis in HL-60 cells, suggesting that the requirement for caspase-3-like proteases in the apoptotic pathway is dependent on the cell type.","['Zisterer, D M', 'McGee, M M', 'Campiani, G', 'Ramunno, A', 'Fattorusso, C', 'Nacci, V', 'Lawler, M', 'Williams, D C']","['Zisterer DM', 'McGee MM', 'Campiani G', 'Ramunno A', 'Fattorusso C', 'Nacci V', 'Lawler M', 'Williams DC']","['Biochemistry Department, Trinity College Dublin, Dublin 2, Ireland. dzistrer@tcd.ie']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Biochem Soc Trans,Biochemical Society transactions,7506897,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzazepines)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Oxazepines)', '0 (Pyrroles)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', '*Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzazepines/*pharmacology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Oxazepines/*pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Pyrroles/*pharmacology']",2001/11/16 10:00,2002/03/13 10:01,['2001/11/16 10:00'],"['2001/11/16 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/13 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/16 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1042/0300-5127:0290704 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochem Soc Trans. 2001 Nov;29(Pt 6):704-6. doi: 10.1042/0300-5127:0290704.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Regulatory systems are usually composed of two expression units, one bearing the gene of interest under control of a regulatable promoter and the other, a constitutively expressed transactivator that modulates the activity of the regulatable promoter. Because the cotransfer of two independent elements is not efficient in primary cells, single transduction step vectors conferring regulatable gene expression cassettes would be helpful. We have developed retroviral vectors containing an autoregulatory bidirectional expression cassette that encodes all components necessary for regulated expression of a gene of interest. The influence of the orientation of the reporter gene with respect to the viral long terminal repeat (LTR) and the effect of transcriptionally inactive LTRs were investigated using mouse leukemia virus (MLV) and self-inactivating (SIN)-based retroviral vectors. Strict regulation was observed when the reporter was inserted in antisense orientation with respect to the LTR, whereas a sense arrangement of the reporter resulted in a loss of regulation capacity. Expression and regulation of the antisense-orientated reporter gene were homogenous in infected cell pools and investigated cell clones. Long-term observations of infected cells over a period of 30 passages revealed stable expression and regulation. These autoregulated, bidirectional retroviral vectors combine the advantages of single-step transduction with strict regulation of the gene of interest in the infected target cells.","['Unsinger, J', 'Kroger, A', 'Hauser, H', 'Wirth, D']","['Unsinger J', 'Kroger A', 'Hauser H', 'Wirth D']","['Department of Gene Regulation and Differentiation, GBF-National Research Center for Biotechnology, D-38124 Braunschweig, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Ther,Molecular therapy : the journal of the American Society of Gene Therapy,100890581,['N12000U13O (Doxycycline)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Doxycycline/pharmacology', 'Feedback, Physiological', 'Fibroblasts', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Genetic Vectors/*genetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mutagenesis, Insertional/*genetics', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', 'Terminal Repeat Sequences/genetics', 'Transduction, Genetic/*methods']",2001/11/16 10:00,2002/03/08 10:01,['2001/11/16 10:00'],"['2001/11/16 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/08 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/16 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1006/mthe.2001.0480 [doi]', 'S1525-0016(01)90480-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Mol Ther. 2001 Nov;4(5):484-9. doi: 10.1006/mthe.2001.0480.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These vectors greatly facilitate delivery into mammalian cells of sequences encoding individual peptide inhibitors-including those with therapeutic utility-and inhibitor libraries. However, retroviral vectors vary in behavior, particularly with respect to expression levels in different cell lines. Expression level is especially important in transdominant experiments because the concentration of an inhibitor (for example, an expressed peptide) is one of the key determinants in the degree of complex formation between the inhibitor and its target. Thus, inhibitor concentration should have an impact on the expressivity and/or penetrance of an induced phenotype. Here, we compare several retroviral vectors and human cell lines for relative expression levels using a green fluorescent protein reporter. We show for a subset of these lines that cellular protein concentrations produced by single-copy vectors range up to about 2 microM. We also examine other variables that contribute to expression level, such as the nature of the expressed protein's carboxy terminus. Finally, we test the effect of increased concentration on phenotype with a nine-amino-acid peptide derived from the human papilloma virus protein E7 which overcomes E7-mediated cell growth.","['Sandrock, T M', 'Risley, B', 'Richards, B T', 'Poritz, M A', 'Austin, H A', 'Yoo, S', 'Kim, M K', 'Roth, B', 'Repetny, K', 'Hsu, F', 'Stump, M', 'Teng, D H', 'Kamb, A']","['Sandrock TM', 'Risley B', 'Richards BT', 'Poritz MA', 'Austin HA', 'Yoo S', 'Kim MK', 'Roth B', 'Repetny K', 'Hsu F', 'Stump M', 'Teng DH', 'Kamb A']","['Deltagen Proteomics, 615 Arapeen Dr., Suite 300, Salt Lake City, UT 84108, USA.

Two fluorogenic probes are available for use on real time quantitation. The fluorogenic 5'-nuclease assay(Taqman method) uses a fluorogenic probe to enable the detection of a sequence specific PCR product. Fluorogenic probe is incorporated with the reporter dye on the 5' end and the quencher on the 3' end. The second method uses SYBR Green I dye which is a highly specific double-stranded DNA binding dye. Real-time PCR is able to be possible exact quantitation of DNA and RNA much more precise and reproducible because it is based on CT values acquired during the exponential phase of PCR rather than endpoint. In this review, the detail protocol of real time quantitative PCR technique will be introduced and our recently developed system for exact quantitation of BCR-ABL fusion gene in CML is going to be described.","['Kim, D W']",['Kim DW'],"['Molecular Hematology Laboratory, Catholic Hemopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Center, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul.']",['kor'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",United States,Exp Mol Med,Experimental & molecular medicine,9607880,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA Probes', 'Fluorescence', 'Fluorescent Dyes/metabolism', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/metabolism', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",2001/11/16 10:00,2002/05/22 10:01,['2001/11/16 10:00'],"['2001/11/16 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/05/22 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/16 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Mol Med. 2001 Apr 21;33(1 Suppl):101-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The median age was 69 years, with bilateral testicular involvement in 16%. The disease stage was I in 56%, II in 32%, and IV in 12%. Twenty-four patients received further therapy after orchiectomy, including chemotherapy in 18 and radiation therapy in 11 (encompassing regional nodes in 8 and the contralateral testis in 6), with 5 patients receiving both modalities. The complete remission rate was 88%, but a continuous pattern of recurrence is evident up to 10 years, when only 23% of patients are predicted to be in ongoing remission. The dominant sites of first failure were extranodal (91%), with prominent involvement of the contralateral testis and cerebral parenchyma. The 10-year overall survival rate is 32%, and the median overall survival is 4.4 years. Within the entire cohort, adverse prognostic factors for treatment failure were serum albumin < or = to 3.5 g/dL (P = 0.02), advanced age, advanced stage, and lack of anthracycline-containing chemotherapy (each P < or = to 0.3). Among patients with locoregional disease, albumin < or = to 3.5 g/dL (P = 0.08), no anthracycline-containing chemotherapy (P = 0.15), and fewer than 6 cycles of chemotherapy (P = 0.03) remained predictive. Based on this analysis, we are prospectively evaluating a treatment program for patients with testicular non-Hodgkin's large-cell lymphoma comprising (1) 6 cycles of anthracycline-based chemotherapy, (2) prophylactic radiation therapy to the contralateral testis, and (3) central nervous system prophylaxis with both intrathecal chemotherapy and systemic high-dose methotrexate.","['Seymour, J F', 'Solomon, B', 'Wolf, M M', 'Janusczewicz, E H', 'Wirth, A', 'Prince, H M']","['Seymour JF', 'Solomon B', 'Wolf MM', 'Janusczewicz EH', 'Wirth A', 'Prince HM']","['Leukaemia/Lymphoma Service, Department of Haematology, The Peter MacCallum Cancer Institute, Melbourne, Australia. jseymour@petermac.unimelb.edu.au']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Clin Lymphoma,Clinical lymphoma,100898741,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Serum Albumin)']",IM,"['Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/therapeutic use', 'Cohort Studies', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*diagnosis/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Serum Albumin/metabolism', 'Testicular Neoplasms/*diagnosis/mortality/*therapy', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",2001/11/15 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/11/15 10:00'],"['2001/11/15 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/15 10:00 [entrez]']","['S1526-9655(11)70138-5 [pii]', '10.3816/clm.2001.n.016 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Lymphoma. 2001 Sep;2(2):109-15. doi: 10.3816/clm.2001.n.016.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rituximab was approved in 1997 by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of relapsed or refractory, CD20(+), B-cell, low-grade or follicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Recent studies have documented activity of rituximab in other CD20-expressing hematological malignancies including mantle cell lymphoma, small lymphocytic lymphoma, aggressive NHL, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia. When used in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy, rituximab achieves response rates of 90%-95% in low-grade follicular and aggressive NHL patients. Currently, rituximab is undergoing intensive investigation in several large phase II and III trials, both as a single agent and in combination with chemotherapy. Clinical research will help define the ultimate role of this agent and its potential impact on survival of patients with B-cell neoplasms. This article describes current clinical trials with rituximab and discusses their significance.","['Petryk, M', 'Grossbard, M L']","['Petryk M', 'Grossbard ML']","[""St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center, New York, NY 10019, USA.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Clin Lymphoma,Clinical lymphoma,100898741,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Rituximab']",2001/11/15 10:00,2002/02/13 10:01,['2001/11/15 10:00'],"['2001/11/15 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/02/13 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/15 10:00 [entrez]']","['S1526-9655(11)70217-2 [pii]', '10.3816/clm.2000.n.015 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Lymphoma. 2000 Dec;1(3):186-94; discussion 195-6. doi: 10.3816/clm.2000.n.015.,,53,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The secondary objectives were to determine prognostic factors for relapse and survival. Between February 1987 and August 1998, 264 patients, 169 (64%) IG and 95 (36%) HG, underwent high-dose therapy and ASCT at City of Hope National Medical Center (COHNMC). There were 157 (59%) males and 107 (41%) females with a median age of 44 years (range, 5-69 years). The median number of prior chemotherapy regimens was 2 (range, 1-4), and 71 (27%) had received prior radiation as part of induction or as salvage therapy. The median time from diagnosis to ASCT was 10.8 months (range, 3-158 months). Ninety-four patients (36%) underwent transplantation in first complete/partial remission (CR/PR), 40 (15%) in induction failure, and 130 (49%) in relapse or subsequent remission. Two preparative regimens were used: total body irradiation/high-dose etoposide/cyclophosphamide (TBI/VP/CY) in 208 patients (79%) and carmustine/etoposide/cyclophosphamide (BCNU/VP/CY) in 56 patients (21%). One hundred sixty-three patients (62%) received peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) and 101 (38%) received bone marrow (BM) alone or BM plus PBSC. At a median follow-up of 4.43 years for surviving patients (range, 1-12.8 years), the 5-year Kaplan-Meier estimates of probability of overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and relapse for all patients are 55% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 49%-61%), 47% (95% CI: 40%-53%), and 47% (95% CI: 40%-54%), respectively. There were 27 deaths (10%) from nonrelapse mortality, including seven (3%) patients who developed second malignancies (five with myelodysplasia/acute myelogenous leukemia and two with solid tumors). By stepwise Cox regression analysis, disease status at ASCT was the only prognostic factor that predicted for both relapse and survival. The 5-year probability of PFS for patients transplanted in first CR/PR was 73% (95% CI: 62%-81%) as compared to 30% (95% CI: 16%-45%) for induction failure and 34% (95% CI: 26%-42%) for relapsed patients. Our results further support the role of high-dose therapy and ASCT during first CR/PR for patients with poor-risk intermediate- and high-grade NHL. Early transplant is recommended for patients failing initial induction therapy or relapsing after chemotherapy-induced remission. Relapse continues to be the most common cause of treatment failure. An alternative approach to prevent relapse, the incorporation of radioimmunotherapy into the high-dose regimen, is being investigated. The development of a second malignancy is a serious complication of high-dose therapy, which requires close surveillance.","['Nademanee, A', 'Molina, A', 'Dagis, A', 'Snyder, D S', ""O'Donnell, M R"", 'Parker, P', 'Stein, A', 'Smith, E', 'Planas, I', 'Kashyap, A', 'Spielberger, R', 'Fung, H', 'Krishnan, A', 'Bhatia, R', 'Wong, K K', 'Somlo, G', 'Margolin, K', 'Chow, W', 'Sniecinski, I', 'Vora, N', 'Slovak, M', 'Niland, J C', 'Forman, S J']","['Nademanee A', 'Molina A', 'Dagis A', 'Snyder DS', ""O'Donnell MR"", 'Parker P', 'Stein A', 'Smith E', 'Planas I', 'Kashyap A', 'Spielberger R', 'Fung H', 'Krishnan A', 'Bhatia R', 'Wong KK', 'Somlo G', 'Margolin K', 'Chow W', 'Sniecinski I', 'Vora N', 'Slovak M', 'Niland JC', 'Forman SJ']","['Division of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, CA 91010, USA. anademanee@coh.org']",['eng'],"['P0CA30206/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P0CA33572/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Clin Lymphoma,Clinical lymphoma,100898741,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",2001/11/15 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/11/15 10:00'],"['2001/11/15 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/15 10:00 [entrez]']","['S1526-9655(11)70199-3 [pii]', '10.3816/clm.2000.n.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Lymphoma. 2000 Jun;1(1):46-54. doi: 10.3816/clm.2000.n.004.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study we have reviewed the final pathological diagnosis of 106 patients with IgM paraproteinemia investigated in our laboratories between April 1993 and May 1999. In 22 of the 106 patients (20.8%), there was no clinical or laboratory evidence of an underlying lymphoproliferative disorder, and a diagnosis of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) was therefore made. In 60 cases (56.6%), a diagnosis of WM was made, while in the remaining 24 patients, the final diagnosis was chronic lymphocytic leukemia (n = 10), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (n = 5), extranodal marginal-zone lymphoma (n = 3), follicular lymphoma (n = 3), and mantle-cell lymphoma (n = 3). The median paraprotein concentration in patients with WM, MGUS, and ""other"" lymphoproliferative disorders was 13 g/L (range, 2-54), 6 g/L (range, 3-30), and 4.5 g/L (range, 3-61), respectively. It is clear that IgM paraproteins are demonstrable in all subtypes of peripheral B-cell disorders and, although paraprotein concentrations are generally higher in WM, there is considerable overlap.

Cytogenetic findings are increasingly associated with molecular abnormalities, some of which are being understood at the functional level. Specific therapies can be developed based on such knowledge. To search for new genes in the acute leukemias, we performed a representational difference analysis. We describe a human gene in chromosome 8q22.3, BAALC (brain and acute leukemia, cytoplasmic), that is highly conserved among mammals but evidently absent from lower organisms. We characterized BAALC on the genomic level and investigated its expression pattern in human and mouse, as well as its complex splicing behavior. In vitro studies of the protein showing its subcellular localization suggest a function in the cytoskeleton network. Two isoforms are specifically expressed in neuroectoderm-derived tissues, but not in tumors or cancer cell lines of nonneural tissue origin.

Among patients with acute myeloid leukemia, those overexpressing BAALC show distinctly poor prognosis, pointing to a key role of the BAALC products in leukemia.

The observations that viruses transcribe their genomes adjacent to PML bodies and that nascent RNA accumulates at their periphery suggest that PML bodies function in transcription. We have used immuno-FISH in primary human fibroblasts to determine the 3D spatial organisation of gene-rich and gene-poor chromosomal regions relative to PML bodies. We find a highly non-random association of the gene-rich major histocompatibilty complex (MHC) on chromosome 6 with PML bodies. This association is specific for the centromeric end of the MHC and extends over a genomic region of at least 1.6 megabases. We also show that PML association is maintained when a subsection of this region is integrated into another chromosomal location.

This is thought to be secondary to the formation of TCL1-Akt oligomers within which Akt is preferentially phosphorylated. Here we show that, in contrast to Akt1 and Akt2, which bind to all members of the TCL1 family, Akt3 specifically interacts with TCL1 but not with MTCP1 or TCL1b. This association is functional, as the presence of TCL1 but not MTCP1 or TCL1b increased Akt3 kinase activity in in vitro kinase assays. Functional specificity is determined by the Akt pleckstrin homology domain as chimeric Akt1, where Akt1 PH domain was replaced by that of Akt3 was no longer able to interact with MTCP1 or TCL1b and its kinase activity was solely enhanced by TCL1. Moreover, we show that, in TCL1-overexpressing SUPT-11 T-cell leukemia and P3HR-1 Burkitt's lymphoma cell lines, TCL1 interacts with endogenous Akt1, Akt2, and Akt3. TCL1 enhanced hetero-oligomerization of Akt1 with Akt3 and as a consequence facilitated transphosphorylation of Akt molecules, which may contribute to Akt activation and TCL1-induced leukemogenesis in vivo.","['Laine, Jarmo', 'Kunstle, Gerald', 'Obata, Toshiyuki', 'Noguchi, Masayuki']","['Laine J', 'Kunstle G', 'Obata T', 'Noguchi M']","['Division of Immunology, Department of Medicine, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02215, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (TCL1A protein, human)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (AKT1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (AKT2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA Primers', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', 'Glutathione Transferase/genetics', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Mammals', 'Phosphorylation', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Protein Binding', '*Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Restriction Mapping', 'T-Lymphocytes', 'Transfection']",2001/11/15 10:00,2002/03/01 10:01,['2001/11/15 10:00'],"['2001/11/15 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/01 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/15 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M107069200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(20)87669-8 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2002 Feb 1;277(5):3743-51. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M107069200.

We previously isolated a cDNA encoding such a protein from the human leukemia cell line K562, termed Beta Protein 1 (BP1), which is involved in negative regulation of the human beta-globin gene. Sequence comparison revealed that BP1 is a member of the distal-less (DLX) family of homeobox genes and that it shares its homeodomain and 3' sequences with another DLX cDNA, DLX7. BP1 and DLX7 exhibit unique 5' regions, diverging at nucleotide 565 of BP1. We mapped this new distal-less family member BP1 to chromosome 17q21-22 by FISH and PCR, which is the same locus to which DLX7 has been mapped. These results strongly suggest that BP1 and DLX7 are isoforms (derived from the same gene). Since our previous data demonstrated that BP1 and DLX7 are frequently co-expressed, we determined whether DLX7 is also involved in the negative regulation of the beta-globin gene. Mobility shift assays demonstrated that both BP1 and DLX7 proteins, synthesized in vitro, bind to the same BP1 binding site. However, using transient assays, we showed that although BP1 represses activity of a reporter gene through either of two silencer DNA sequences upstream of the beta-globin gene, DLX7 did not show repressor activity against the beta-globin promoter. Further characterization of these apparent isoforms is of significance since they are jointly expressed in acute myeloid leukemia and in many leukemia cell lines.","['Fu, S', 'Stevenson, H', 'Strovel, J W', 'Haga, S B', 'Stamberg, J', 'Do, K', 'Berg, P E']","['Fu S', 'Stevenson H', 'Strovel JW', 'Haga SB', 'Stamberg J', 'Do K', 'Berg PE']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, The George Washington University Medical Center, Washington, DC 20037, USA.']",['eng'],['R01 DK53533/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Gene,Gene,7706761,"['0 (DLX4 protein, human)', '0 (Dlx4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes, Homeobox/genetics/physiology', 'Globins/*genetics', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'K562 Cells', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Oncogene Proteins', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Isoforms/genetics/metabolism/physiology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/physiology', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', '*Transcription Factors']",2001/11/15 10:00,2002/01/11 10:01,['2001/11/15 10:00'],"['2001/11/15 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/11 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/15 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0378111901007168 [pii]', '10.1016/s0378-1119(01)00716-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Gene. 2001 Oct 31;278(1-2):131-9. doi: 10.1016/s0378-1119(01)00716-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A parallel FACS analysis revealed surface expression of gp130 and OSMR-beta, but not of LIFR on these cells. Functionally, OSM upregulated intercellular adhesion molecule-1, but did not induce vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 in HCEC. Further, OSM upregulated IL-6 and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1, whereas IL-8 was unaffected. Combined application of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and OSM synergistically enhanced IL-6 and MCP-1 production, but downregulated TNF-alpha-induced IL-8. As OSM regulated molecules relevant in inflammatory brain diseases, we investigated its expression in normal and pathological human brains. OSM was detected by immunohistochemistry in brains from multiple sclerosis patients in microglia, reactive astrocytes, and infiltrating leukocytes, whereas in normal brains and noninflammatory neurological diseases. immunoreactivity was absent from the parenchyma.

The tumor exhibited rosette-like formations. This case was initially interpreted as Ewing's sarcoma (ES); however, additional studies revealed positivity for CD79a, CD43, and TdT expression, and an immunoglobulin heavy chain gene rearrangement (IgH-R) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) established this to be a precursor B-lymphoblastic lymphoma. Because the differential diagnosis of ES and lymphoblastic lymphoma can be difficult and the differential diagnostic value of leukocyte antigens and immunoglobulin heavy chain gene rearrangement studies have not been fully evaluated, we conducted a more extensive investigation on 33 (21 soft tissue and 12 intraosseous) ES cases. Cases were retrieved from the files of the Department of Pathology at Georgetown University and from the Soft Tissue Registry of the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology. The cases were studied by light microscopy, immunohistochemistry, and PCR for IgH-R and T cell receptor gamma chain gene rearrangement (Tgamma-R). There were 17 females and 16 males; the mean age was 29.3 years. Locations included the extremities (n = 17) and trunk (n = 16). All cases fit the ES spectrum by light microscopy and immunohistochemistry, as previously determined, and were negative for lymphoid markers (LCA, CD3, CD20, CD43, CD79a, and TdT), CD10 and CD34. CD99 was positive in 31/33 and bcl-2 was weakly positive in 13/33 cases. All 21 cases studied for gene rearrangements by PCR were negative for IgH-R and Tgamma-R. Distinction of intraosseous lymphoblastic lymphoma from ES may be difficult because lymphomas may occasionally exhibit unexpected morphologic and immunophenotypic properties including LCA, CD3 and CD20 negativity and cytokeratin positivity. Additional analysis using CD79a, CD43, TdT, and PCR should be performed to avoid misdiagnosis. True ES is negative for lymphoid markers including CD79a, CD43, and TdT, as well as for IgH-R and Tgamma-R.","['Ozdemirli, M', 'Fanburg-Smith, J C', 'Hartmann, D P', 'Azumi, N', 'Miettinen, M']","['Ozdemirli M', 'Fanburg-Smith JC', 'Hartmann DP', 'Azumi N', 'Miettinen M']","['Department of Pathology, Georgetown University Medical Center, 3900 Reservoir Road N.W., Washington, DC 20007, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Mod Pathol,"Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc",8806605,"['0 (12E7 Antigen)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (CD99 protein, human)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Vimentin)']",IM,"['12E7 Antigen', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Biomarkers/analysis', 'Bone Neoplasms/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/analysis', 'Child', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/genetics', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Lymphocytes/chemistry/pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/analysis', 'Sarcoma, Ewing/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Vimentin/analysis']",2001/11/14 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/11/14 10:00'],"['2001/11/14 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/14 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/modpathol.3880455 [doi]'],ppublish,Mod Pathol. 2001 Nov;14(11):1175-82. doi: 10.1038/modpathol.3880455.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We studied eight cases of primary ovarian NHL to better understand the clinicopathologic and immunophenotypic features of these tumors. The patients ranged in age from 29 to 62 years (mean 47 years). Pelvic complaints were the most common symptoms; however, three of eight neoplasms were discovered incidentally. All tumors were unilateral and Ann Arbor stage I(E). The three incidental NHL were microscopic (largest 1.2 cm), whereas the grossly evident lesions ranged from 7.5 to 20 cm (mean 13.3). Each tumor was classified according to the World Health Organization Classification as follows: diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (three cases), follicular lymphoma (two cases), Burkitt lymphoma (one case), T-cell anaplastic large cell lymphoma (one case), and precursor T-lymphoblastic lymphoma (one case). Six tumors were of B-cell lineage, and two tumors were of T-cell lineage. All three diffuse large B-cell lymphomas were positive for BCL-6, two were positive for CD10, and two were positive for BCL-2. Estrogen and progesterone receptors were negative in all NHLs assessed. Patients were treated by various combinations of surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. Clinical follow-up ranged from 1.3 to 11.7 years (mean 5.2) and all patients were alive without disease at last follow-up. We conclude that most patients with primary ovarian NHL present with symptoms attributable to an ovarian mass, but in a subset of patients ovarian NHL may be detected incidentally. With appropriate therapy, patients appear to have a favorable prognosis although follow-up is short for some patients in this study.","['Vang, R', 'Medeiros, L J', 'Warnke, R A', 'Higgins, J P', 'Deavers, M T']","['Vang R', 'Medeiros LJ', 'Warnke RA', 'Higgins JP', 'Deavers MT']","['Stanford University Medical Center, Department of Pathology (Laboratory of Surgical Pathology), Stanford, California, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Mod Pathol,"Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc",8806605,"['0 (12E7 Antigen)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD99 protein, human)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-6)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 3.4.24.11 (Neprilysin)']",IM,"['12E7 Antigen', 'Adult', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/analysis', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/metabolism/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/metabolism/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Neprilysin/analysis', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/metabolism/*pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/metabolism/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/analysis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/analysis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-6', 'Transcription Factors/analysis']",2001/11/14 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/11/14 10:00'],"['2001/11/14 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/14 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/modpathol.3880442 [doi]'],ppublish,Mod Pathol. 2001 Nov;14(11):1093-9. doi: 10.1038/modpathol.3880442.,,37,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because incorporation of nucleotide analogues into the repair patches elicits death signals in quiescent cells, the increased capacity for excision repair in alkylator-resistant cells could facilitate incorporation of nucleotide analogues. We hypothesized that the mechanism-based interaction of nucleoside analogues with alkylating agents could elicit greater than additive killing of CLL cells. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Lymphocytes from 50 patients with CLL that were not refractory to alkylators were treated in vitro with 4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide (4-HC) with or without prior incubation with fludarabine nucleoside (F-ara-A) or with clofarabine (Cl-F-ara-A). DNA damage repair kinetics were determined by the single-cell gel electrophoresis (comet) assay. Cytotoxicity was assessed by staining with annexin V. RESULTS: CLL lymphocytes promptly initiated and completed excision repair in response to 4-HC. A 2-h preincubation with 10 microM F-ara-A or 10 microM Cl-F-ara-A inhibited the repair initiated by 4-HC, with inhibition peaking at the intracellular concentrations of 50 microM F-ara-ATP or 5 microM Cl-F-ara-ATP. Combining 4-HC with either F-ara-A or Cl-F-ara-A produced more than additive apoptotic cell death than the sum of each alone. The increase in cytotoxicity was proportional to the initial magnitude of the DNA incision and to the extent of repair inhibition by the nucleoside analogues, suggesting close correlation between the repair inhibition and induction of cell death. CONCLUSIONS: DNA repair, which is active in CLL lymphocytes, may be a biological target for facilitating the incorporation of nucleoside analogues and increasing their cytotoxicity. Thus, the increased repair capacity associated with resistant disease may be manipulated to therapeutic advantage.","['Yamauchi, T', 'Nowak, B J', 'Keating, M J', 'Plunkett, W']","['Yamauchi T', 'Nowak BJ', 'Keating MJ', 'Plunkett W']","['Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas M.

These cells were found to be less sensitive to CdA than B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia lymphocytes (approximately 25-fold) and other human lymphoblastic cell lines (10-1000-fold). Phosphorylation of CdA by deoxycytidine kinase and intracellular accumulation of 2-chloro-2'-deoxyadenosine triphosphate (CdATP) were similar in EHEB cells and in other CdA-sensitive cell lines. In contrast, the inhibitory effect of CdA on ribonucleotide reductase activity, which was investigated in situ by the conversion of cytidine into deoxyribonucleotides and its incorporation into DNA, was much less pronounced in EHEB cells than in other human lymphoblastic cells. Accordingly, concentrations of deoxynucleoside triphosphates did not decrease and even tended to rise. Unexpectedly, incorporation of thymidine and deoxycytidine into DNA was increased severalfold after a 24-h incubation with CdA. CdA also increased the activities of deoxycytidine kinase and thymidine kinase approximately 4-fold. Analysis of the cell cycle by flow cytometry showed that after 24 h, CdA provoked an increase in the proportion of cells in S phase, synthesizing DNA. We conclude that the EHEB cell line is resistant to the cytotoxic action of CdA not only because of a lack of inhibition of ribonucleotide reduction but also because CdA, in contrast with its known effects, provokes in this cell line an increase in the proportion of cells replicating their DNA. Unraveling of the mechanism of this effect may shed light on clinical resistance to CdA.","['Cardoen, S', 'Van Den Neste, E', 'Smal, C', 'Rosier, J F', 'Delacauw, A', 'Ferrant, A', 'Van den Berghe, G', 'Bontemps, F']","['Cardoen S', 'Van Den Neste E', 'Smal C', 'Rosier JF', 'Delacauw A', 'Ferrant A', 'Van den Berghe G', 'Bontemps F']","['Laboratory of Physiological Chemistry, Christian de Duve Institute of Cellular Pathology, Avenue Hippocrate 75, UCL-ICP 7539, B-1200 Brussels, Belgium.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Nucleotides)', '0W860991D6 (Deoxycytidine)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)', '5CSZ8459RP (Cytidine)', 'EC 1.17.4.- (Ribonucleotide Reductases)', 'EC 2.7.1.21 (Thymidine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.1.74 (Deoxycytidine Kinase)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cladribine/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Cytidine/metabolism', 'DNA, Neoplasm/drug effects/metabolism', 'Deoxycytidine/metabolism', 'Deoxycytidine Kinase/drug effects/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', 'Nucleotides/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Ribonucleotide Reductases/drug effects/metabolism', 'Thymidine Kinase/drug effects/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/11/14 10:00,2002/02/22 10:01,['2001/11/14 10:00'],"['2001/11/14 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/02/22 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/14 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2001 Nov;7(11):3559-66.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To date, these falconensones and their derivatives, falconensone A p-bromophenylhydrazone and falconensone A dioxime are known to exhibit biological activities, which include growth inhibition and both induction of differentiation and apoptosis of HL60 human leukemia cells. The synthetic derivatives have been shown to be more potent than natural falconensone A and B in eliciting these activities. Herein, we investigate whether falconensones inhibit growth of other cancer cell lines in vitro, and we evaluate their ability to modify survival in C57 BL/6J mice using M5076 murine reticulosarcoma in vivo, which is established as the metastasis model. Falconensone A, falconensone A p-bromophenylhydrazone, and falconensone A dioxime inhibit growth of human myeloid leukemia cell lines, HL60 and HL60R, human hepatoma cell line HepG2, human prostate cancer cell line DU-145, and human breast cancer cell line MCF-7/Adr(R), whereas falconensone B, the 4'-nor-methyl derivative of falconensone A, shows extremely low or no activity. In contrast, all of the falconensones are active in growth inhibition of human breast cancer cell line MCF-7. Survival time of M5076-implanted mice was prolonged by treatment with falconensones, particularly falconensone A dioxime. These results indicate that falconensone A and its derivatives exhibit anticancer efficacy in a broad spectrum of cancer cell lines.

In genomic DNAs prepared from 105 leukemia (n = 54) and non-leukemia (n = 51) specimens, PCR amplifications and direct sequencing of exon 3 identified a high-frequency G to A single nucleotide polymorphism at position 80 that resulted in a change of arginine-27 to histidine-27. The allelic frequencies of G/A80 were nearly identical for the non-leukemia (42.2% CGC and 57.8% CAC) and leukemia (40.7% CGC and 59.3% CAC) genomic DNAs. In cDNAs prepared from 10 of these ALL patients, identical allelic frequencies (40 and 60%, respectively) were recorded. In up to 62 genomic DNAs, hRFC-coding exons 4-7 were PCR-amplified and sequenced. A high-abundance C/T696 polymorphism was detected with nearly identical frequencies for both alleles, and a heterozygous C/A1242 sequence variant was identified in two ALL specimens. Both C/T696 and C/A1242 were phenotypically silent. In transport assays with [(3)H]methotrexate and [(3)H]5-formyl tetrahydrofolate, nearly identical uptake rates were measured for the arginine-27- and histidine-27-hRFC proteins expressed in transport-impaired K562 cells. Although there were no significant differences between the kinetic parameters for methotrexate transport for the hRFC forms, minor (approximately 2-fold) differences were measured in the K(i)s for other substrates including Tomudex, 5,10-dideazatetrahydrofolate, GW1843U89, and 10-ethyl-10-deazaaminopterin and for 5-formyl tetrahydrofolate.","['Whetstine, J R', 'Gifford, A J', 'Witt, T', 'Liu, X Y', 'Flatley, R M', 'Norris, M', 'Haber, M', 'Taub, J W', 'Ravindranath, Y', 'Matherly, L H']","['Whetstine JR', 'Gifford AJ', 'Witt T', 'Liu XY', 'Flatley RM', 'Norris M', 'Haber M', 'Taub JW', 'Ravindranath Y', 'Matherly LH']","['Department of Pharmacology, Barbara Ann Karmanos Cancer Institute, Wayne State University School of Medicine, 110 East Warren Avenue, Detroit, MI 48201, USA.']",['eng'],['CA 77641/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Membrane Transport Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Reduced Folate Carrier Protein)', '0 (SLC19A1 protein, human)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Substitution', 'B-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Base Sequence', 'Biological Transport/genetics', 'Carrier Proteins/*genetics', 'Child', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'DNA, Complementary/chemistry/genetics', 'DNA, Neoplasm/chemistry/genetics', 'Gene Frequency', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', '*Membrane Transport Proteins', 'Methotrexate/pharmacokinetics', 'Mutagenesis, Insertional', 'Plasmids/genetics', 'Point Mutation', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*pathology', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics/metabolism', 'Reduced Folate Carrier Protein', 'Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Transfection']",2001/11/14 10:00,2002/02/22 10:01,['2001/11/14 10:00'],"['2001/11/14 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/02/22 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/14 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2001 Nov;7(11):3416-22.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, this study examined the cellular VEGF levels in 31 newly diagnosed and 22 recurrent cases of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: VEGF was determined with real-time quantitative PCR methods. Kaplan-Meier statistical analyses were conducted for the relapse-free intervals and the overall survival times. The groups were compared by log-rank and rank-sum tests. RESULTS: The VEGF levels were significantly higher in recurrent ALL compared with newly diagnosed ALL (28.0 versus 3.1 units; P = 0.001). Kaplan-Meier estimates were conducted to analyze the prognostic value of VEGF levels in newly diagnosed ALL with regard to the relapse-free intervals and the overall survival times. In this analysis, the median relapse-free interval of patients with low VEGF levels was more than 10 years, whereas the relapse-free interval of patients with high VEGF expression was only 1.2 years. The median overall survival time for the collective with low VEGF levels was >10 years, whereas the survival of the group of patients with high VEGF levels was 3.9 years. This difference was not statistically significant. This may be attributable to the small number of patients involved. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that VEGF may play an important role in the pathophysiology of ALL. The expression of VEGF raises the possibility of using angiogenesis inhibitors as a novel therapeutic strategy in childhood ALL.","['Koomagi, R', 'Zintl, F', 'Sauerbrey, A', 'Volm, M']","['Koomagi R', 'Zintl F', 'Sauerbrey A', 'Volm M']","['Department of Oncological Diagnostics and Therapy, German Cancer Research Center, In Neuenheimer Feld 280, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Endothelial Growth Factors)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Endothelial Growth Factors/*genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Lymphokines/*genetics', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*pathology', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics/metabolism', 'Survival Analysis', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors']",2001/11/14 10:00,2002/02/22 10:01,['2001/11/14 10:00'],"['2001/11/14 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/02/22 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/14 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2001 Nov;7(11):3381-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

No effective systemic treatment is available. Imatinib (STI571) inhibits a similar tyrosine kinase, BCR-ABL, leading to responses in chronic myeloid leukaemia, and has also been shown to inhibit KIT. We did a phase I study to identify the dose-limiting toxic effects of imatinib in patients with advanced soft tissue sarcomas including GISTs. METHODS: 40 patients (of whom 36 had GISTs) received imatinib at doses of 400 mg once daily, 300 mg twice daily, 400 mg twice daily, or 500 mg twice daily. Toxic effects and haematological, biochemical, and radiological measurements were assessed during 8 weeks of follow-up. 18Fluorodeoxy-glucose positron-emission tomography (PET) was used for response assessment in one centre. FINDINGS: Five patients on 500 mg imatinib twice daily had dose-limiting toxic effects (severe nausea, vomiting, oedema, or rash). Inhibition of tumour growth was seen in all but four patients with GISTs, resulting in 19 confirmed partial responses and six as yet unconfirmed partial responses or more than 20% regressions. 24 of 27 clinically symptomatic patients showed improvement, and 29 of 36 were still on treatment after more than 9 months. PET scan responses predicted subsequent computed tomography responses. INTERPRETATION: Imatinib at a dose of 400 mg twice daily is well tolerated during the first 8 weeks, side-effects diminish with continuing treatment, and it has significant activity in patients with advanced GISTs. Our results provide evidence of a role for KIT in GISTs, and show the potential for the development of anticancer drugs based on specific molecular abnormalities present in cancers.","['van Oosterom, A T', 'Judson, I', 'Verweij, J', 'Stroobants, S', 'Donato di Paola, E', 'Dimitrijevic, S', 'Martens, M', 'Webb, A', 'Sciot, R', 'Van Glabbeke, M', 'Silberman, S', 'Nielsen, O S']","['van Oosterom AT', 'Judson I', 'Verweij J', 'Stroobants S', 'Donato di Paola E', 'Dimitrijevic S', 'Martens M', 'Webb A', 'Sciot R', 'Van Glabbeke M', 'Silberman S', 'Nielsen OS']","['Department of Oncology, Nuclear Medicine and Pathology, UZ Gasthuisberg, Catholic University, Herestraat 49, B-3000, Leuven, Belgium. allan.vanoosterom@uz.kuleuven.ac.be']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Lancet,"Lancet (London, England)",2985213R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0Z5B2CJX4D (Fluorodeoxyglucose F18)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Fluorodeoxyglucose F18', 'Gastrointestinal Neoplasms/diagnostic imaging/*drug therapy/secondary', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperazines/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Radionuclide Imaging', 'Treatment Outcome']",2001/11/14 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/11/14 10:00'],"['2001/11/14 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/14 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0140673601065357 [pii]', '10.1016/s0140-6736(01)06535-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Lancet. 2001 Oct 27;358(9291):1421-3. doi: 10.1016/s0140-6736(01)06535-7.,,,,,,['Lancet. 2001 Dec 1;358(9296):1903.

We challenged this hypothesis in a rat model for neurodegeneration. In a kinetic study, we found that microglia cells of rats neonatally inoculated with neurovirulent murine leukemia virus (MuLV) NT40 became infected in vivo to maximal levels within 9-13 days postinoculation (d.p.i.). Beginning from 13 d.p.i., degenerative alterations, i.e., vacuolization of neurons and neuropil were found in cerebellar and other brain-stem nuclei. Elevated numbers of activated microglia cells--as revealed by immunohistochemical staining with monoclonal antibody ED1--were first detected at 19 d.p.i. and were always locally associated with degenerated areas but not with nonaltered, yet infected, brain regions. Both neuropathological changes and activated microglia cells increased in intensity and numbers, respectively, with ongoing infection but did not spread to other than initially affected brain regions. By ribonuclease protection assays, we were unable to detect differences in the expression levels of tumor-necrosis-factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in microglia cells nor in total brains from infected versus uninfected rats. Our results suggest that the activation of microglia in the course of MuLV neurodegeneration is rather a reaction to, and not the cause of, neuronal damage. Furthermore, overt expression of the proinflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-6 within the CNS is not required for the induction of retroviral associated neurodegeneration in rats.","['Hansen, R', 'Sauder, C', 'Czub, S', 'Bachmann, E', 'Schimmer, S', 'Hegyi, A', 'Czub, M']","['Hansen R', 'Sauder C', 'Czub S', 'Bachmann E', 'Schimmer S', 'Hegyi A', 'Czub M']","['Institut fur Virologie und Immunbiologie, Universitat Wurzburg, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Neurovirol,Journal of neurovirology,9508123,"['0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cerebral Cortex/immunology', 'Encephalitis, Viral/immunology/pathology/virology', 'Gene Expression/immunology', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Interleukin-1/genetics/immunology', 'Interleukin-6/genetics/immunology', '*Leukemia Virus, Murine', 'Microglia/*immunology/virology', 'Neurodegenerative Diseases/*immunology/pathology/*virology', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred F344', 'Retroviridae Infections/*immunology/pathology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/genetics/immunology', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/analysis/immunology']",2001/11/13 10:00,2002/02/05 10:01,['2001/11/13 10:00'],"['2001/11/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/02/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/13 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/135502801753248088 [doi]'],ppublish,J Neurovirol. 2001 Dec;7(6):501-10. doi: 10.1080/135502801753248088.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The different biological actions of IFN are believed to be mediated by the products of specifically induced cellular genes in the target cells. The promyelocytic leukaemia (PML) protein localizes both in the nucleoplasm and in matrix-associated multi-protein complexes known as nuclear bodies (NBs). PML is essential for the proper formation and the integrity of the NBs. Modification of PML by the Small Ubiquitin MOdifier (SUMO) was shown to be required for its localization in NBs. The number and the intensity of PML NBs increase in response to interferon (IFN). Inactivation of the IFN-induced PML gene by its fusion to retinoic acid receptor alpha alters the normal localization of PML from the punctuate nuclear patterns of NBs to micro-dispersed tiny dots and results in uncontrolled growth in Acute Promyelocytic Leukaemia. The NBs-associated proteins, PML, Sp100, Sp140, Sp110, ISG20 and PA28 are induced by IFN suggesting that nuclear bodies could play a role in IFN response. Although the function of PML NBs is still unclear, some results indicate that they may represent preferential targets for viral infections and that PML could play a role in the mechanism of the antiviral action of IFNs. Viruses, which require the cellular machinery for their replication, have evolved different ways to counteract the action of IFN by inhibiting IFN signalling, by blocking the activities of specific antiviral mediators or by altering PML expression and/or localization on nuclear bodies.","['Regad, T', 'Chelbi-Alix, M K']","['Regad T', 'Chelbi-Alix MK']","['UPR 9045 CNRS, Institut Andre Lwoff, 7 rue Guy Moquet 94801, Villejuif, Cedex, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Enzymes)', '0 (Myxovirus Resistance Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', '9008-11-1 (Interferons)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Nucleus Structures/drug effects/*metabolism', 'DNA Virus Infections/*metabolism', 'Enzymes/metabolism', '*GTP-Binding Proteins', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interferons/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Myxovirus Resistance Proteins', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Organelles/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Proteins/metabolism', 'RNA Virus Infections/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",2001/11/13 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/11/13 10:00'],"['2001/11/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/13 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1204854 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 2001 Oct 29;20(49):7274-86. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1204854.,,119,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Specific molecular determinants (the AF2 transactivator domain of RARalpha for retinoic acid and the K160 SUMO-binding site in PML for arsenic) are respectively implicated in RA- or arsenic-triggered catabolism. The respective roles of PML/RARalpha activation versus its catabolism are discussed with respect to differentiation or apoptosis induction in the context of single or dual therapies.","['Zhu, J', 'Lallemand-Breitenbach, V', 'de The, H']","['Zhu J', 'Lallemand-Breitenbach V', 'de The H']","[""CNRS UPR 9051, Laboratoire associe #11 Comite de Paris de la Ligue Francaise contre le Cancer, Affilie a l'Universite de Paris VII.

APL is associated with a reciprocal chromosomal translocation of chromosomes 15 and 17, which results in a fusion protein comprising PML and the retinoic acid receptor alpha. The PML genomic locus is approximately 35 kb and is subdivided into nine exons. A large number of alternative spliced transcripts are synthesized from the PML gene, resulting in a variety of PML proteins ranging in molecular weight from 48-97 kDa. In this review we summarize the data on the known PML isoforms and splice variants and present a new unifying nomenclature. Although, the function/s of the PML variants are unclear, all PML isoforms contain an identical N-terminal region, suggesting that these sequences are indispensable for function, but differ in their C-terminal sequences. The N-terminal region harbours a RING-finger, two B-boxes and a predicted alpha-helical Coiled-Coil domain, that together form the RBCC/TRIM motif found in a large family of proteins. In PML this motif is essential for PML nuclear body formation in vivo and PML-homo and hetero interactions conferring growth suppressor, apoptotic and anti-viral activities. In APL oligomerization mediated by the RBCC/TRIM motif is essential for the transformation potential of the PML-RARalpha fusion protein.","['Jensen, K', 'Shiels, C', 'Freemont, P S']","['Jensen K', 'Shiels C', 'Freemont PS']","['Centre for Structural Biology, Imperial College of Science, Technology and Medicine, Flowers Building, Armstrong Road, London SW7 2AZ, UK.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Microtubule Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tripartite Motif Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Mid1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (TRIM37 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 6.- (Ligases)']",IM,"['Alternative Splicing', 'Amino Acid Motifs/genetics', 'Animals', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/genetics', 'Ligases/genetics', '*Microtubule Proteins', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*classification/*physiology', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Isoforms/classification/physiology', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary/genetics', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Terminology as Topic', 'Transcription Factors/*classification/genetics/*physiology', 'Tripartite Motif Proteins', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases']",2001/11/13 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/11/13 10:00'],"['2001/11/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/13 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1204765 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 2001 Oct 29;20(49):7223-33. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1204765.,,132,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This finding, coupled with the remarkable success of retinoic acid (RA), the natural ligand of RARalpha, in the treatment of APL, has made APL a unique model system in the study of oncogenic conversion of transcription factors in hematological malignancies. Indeed, subsequent basic and clinical studies showed that chromosomal translocation involving the RARalpha gene is the cytogenetic hallmark of APL and that these mutant forms of RARs are the oncogenes in APL that interfere with the proliferation and differentiation pathways controlled by both RAR and their fusion partners. However, it was not until recently that the role of aberrant transcriptional regulation in the pathogenesis of APL was revealed. In this review, we summarize the biochemical and biological mechanisms of transcriptional regulation by mutant RARs and their corresponding wild-type fusion partner PML and PLZF.

Although relatively rare among hematopoietic malignancies (approximately 10% of AML cases), this disease has attracted a particularly good share of attention by becoming the first human cancer in which all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA), a physiologically active derivative of vitamin A, was able to induce complete remission (CR). ATRA induced remission is not associated with rapid cell death, as in the case of conventional chemotherapy, but with a restoration of the 'normal' granulocytic differentiation pathway. With this remarkable medical success story APL has overnight become a paradigm for the differentiation therapy of cancer. A few years later, excitement with APL was further enhanced by the discovery that a cytogenetic marker for this disease, the t(15:17) reciprocal chromosomal translocation, involves a fusion between the retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARalpha) gene and a previously unknown locus named promyelocytic leukemia (PML). Consequence of this gene rearrangement is expression of the PML-RARalpha chimeric oncoprotein, which is responsible for the cellular transformation as well as ATRA response that is observed in APL. Since this initial discovery, a number of different translocation partner genes of RARalpha have been reported in rarer cases of APL, strongly suggesting that disruption of RARalpha underlies its pathogenesis. This article reviews various rearrangements of the RARalpha gene that have so far been described in literature, functions of the proteins encoded by the different RARalpha partner loci, and implications that these may have for the molecular pathogenesis of APL.","['Zelent, A', 'Guidez, F', 'Melnick, A', 'Waxman, S', 'Licht, J D']","['Zelent A', 'Guidez F', 'Melnick A', 'Waxman S', 'Licht JD']","['Leukemia Research Fund Centre at the Institute of Cancer Research, Chester Beatty Laboratories, 237 Fulham Road, London SW3 6JB, UK. a.zelent@icr.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['CA59936/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'KO8 CA73762/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Antigens, Nuclear)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Milk Proteins)', '0 (NPM-RARalpha protein, human)', '0 (NUMA1 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (NuMa-RARalpha protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Matrix-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (PLZF-RARalpha fusion protein, human)', '0 (RARA protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Antigens, Nuclear', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy/*genetics', '*Milk Proteins', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics', 'Nuclear Matrix-Associated Proteins', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/*genetics', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor', 'Trans-Activators/genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic/*genetics', 'Tretinoin']",2001/11/13 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/11/13 10:00'],"['2001/11/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/13 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1204766 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 2001 Oct 29;20(49):7186-203. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1204766.,,211,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This recurrent involvement of RARalpha in the pathogenesis of APL is likely to reflect an important role played by this receptor during the differentiation of immature myeloid cells to neutrophils. RARalpha is a negative regulator of promyelocyte differentiation when not complexed with RA, and stimulates this differentiation when bound to RA. Since RARs are dispensable for the generation of mature neutrophils, their role thus appears to be to modulatory, rather than obligatory, for the control of neutrophil differentiation. In vitro, retinoic acid is also a potent inducer of neutrophil cell fate, suggesting that it might play a role in the commitment of pluripotent hematopoietic progenitors to the neutrophil lineage.

Over the past 5 years, it has been well demonstrated that As(2)O(3) induces a high complete remission (CR) rate in both primary and relapsed APL patients (around 85 to 90%). The side effects are mild to moderate in relapsed patients, while severe hepatic lesions have been found in some primary cases. After CR obtained in relapsed patients, chemotherapy in combination with As(2)O(3) as post-remission therapy has given better survival than those treated with As(2)O(3) alone. The effect of As(2)O(3) has been shown to be related to the expression of APL-specific PML-RARalpha oncoprotein, and there is a synergistic effect between As(2)O(3) and ATRA in an APL mouse model. Cell biology studies have revealed that As(2)O(3) exerts dose-dependent dual effects on APL cells. Apoptosis is evident when cells are treated with 0.5 approximately 2.0 microM of As(2)O(3) while partial differentiation is observed using low concentrations (0.1 approximately 0.5 microM) of the drug. The apoptosis-inducing effect is associated with the collapse of mitochondrial transmembrane potentials in a thiol-dependent manner, whereas the mechanisms underlying APL cell differentiation induced by low dose arsenic remain to be explored. Interestingly, As(2)O(3) over a wide range of concentration (0.1 approximately 2.0 microM) induces degradation of a key leukemogenic protein, PML-RARalpha, as well as the wild-type PML, thus setting up a good example of targeting therapy for human cancers.","['Zhang, T D', 'Chen, G Q', 'Wang, Z G', 'Wang, Z Y', 'Chen, S J', 'Chen, Z']","['Zhang TD', 'Chen GQ', 'Wang ZG', 'Wang ZY', 'Chen SJ', 'Chen Z']","['The First Hospital affiliated to Harbin Medical University, 23 You Zheng Road, Nangang District, Harbin, 150001, PR China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Pml protein, mouse)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/drug effects', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Oxides/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Rate', 'Transcription Factors/biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Tretinoin/administration & dosage', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",2001/11/13 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/11/13 10:00'],"['2001/11/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/13 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1204762 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 2001 Oct 29;20(49):7146-53. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1204762.,,71,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Experience accumulated over the last 10 years has clearly shown that the combination of ATRA and chemotherapy gives better survival in newly diagnosed APL than chemotherapy alone because of fewer relapses and a higher CR rate experienced by these patients.

Our data revealed that beta(2)m is very significantly down-regulated in two multidrug resistant variants of the HL-60 cells: (a) the MRP1-bearing, Bax-deficient HL-60/ADR cell line, and (b) the P-glycoprotein (P-gp) overexpressing HL-60/VCR cell line. However, exogenous beta(2)m induced similar levels of apoptosis in HL-60 cells and these drug resistant variants. beta(2)m-induced apoptosis in HL-60 and HL-60/VCR cells was associated with decreased mitochondrial membrane potential (Deltapsim) but did not affect Deltapsim in HL-60/ADR cells. Surprisingly, cyclosporin A (CsA), a known inhibitor of the mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) pore, inhibited beta(2)m-induced apoptosis in HL-60/ADR cells but not in HL-60 and HL-60/VCR cells, suggesting that the pro-apoptotic effect of beta(2)m in these cells is not through MPT pore formation. Furthermore, beta(2)m induced the release of cytochrome c and the apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) from mitochondria in HL-60 and HL-60/VCR cells, but not in HL-60/ADR cells. Additionally, Z-VAD-fmk, a general inhibitor of caspases which inhibited cytochrome c release in HL-60 and HL-60/VCR cells, had no effect on AIF release in any of these cell lines, but inhibited beta(2)m-induced apoptosis in all three cell lines. However, Western blot analysis revealed that caspases-1, -3, -6, -8, and -9 are not activated during beta(2)m-induced apoptosis in these cells. Therefore, beta(2)m-induces apoptosis through an unknown caspase-dependent mitochondrial pathway in HL-60 and HL-60/VCR cells and by a Bax-independent, non-mitochondrial, caspase-dependent pathway in HL-60/ADR cells.","['Wu, C H', 'Rastegar, M', 'Gordon, J', 'Safa, A R']","['Wu CH', 'Rastegar M', 'Gordon J', 'Safa AR']","['Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Indiana University 1044 West Walnut R4-119, Indianapolis, Indiana, IN 46202, USA.']",['eng'],['CA 80734/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (AIFM1 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Apoptosis Inducing Factor)', '0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Cytochrome c Group)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Flavoproteins)', '0 (Ion Channels)', '0 (MSH3 protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Mitochondrial Membrane Transport Proteins)', '0 (Mitochondrial Permeability Transition Pore)', '0 (Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins)', '0 (MutS Homolog 3 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (benzyloxycarbonylvalyl-alanyl-aspartyl fluoromethyl ketone)', '0 (beta 2-Microglobulin)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'Y49M64GZ4Q (multidrug resistance-associated protein 1)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Apoptosis Inducing Factor', 'Cyclosporine/pharmacology', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/physiology', 'Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Cytochrome c Group/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/genetics/*physiology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics/*physiology', 'Flavoproteins/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'HL-60 Cells/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', '*Ion Channels', 'Membrane Potentials', 'Membrane Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Mitochondria/physiology', 'Mitochondrial Membrane Transport Proteins', 'Mitochondrial Permeability Transition Pore', '*Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins', 'MutS Homolog 3 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*deficiency/genetics/metabolism', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'RNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Vinblastine/pharmacology', 'Vincristine/pharmacology', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein', 'beta 2-Microglobulin/biosynthesis/genetics/pharmacology/*physiology']",2001/11/13 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/11/13 10:00'],"['2001/03/26 00:00 [received]', '2001/07/17 00:00 [revised]', '2001/08/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2001/11/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/13 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1204893 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 2001 Oct 25;20(48):7006-20. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1204893.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In large-volume apheresis (LVL) procedure, more cells can be collected than were originally present in the peripheral blood at the start of the collection procedure. We prospectively studied the levels of CD34+ cells in the blood and apheresis product during LVL procedures for 21 patients with acute myelogenous leukemia or multiple myeloma. These patients experienced a slow decline in blood CD34+ cell concentrations during the apheresis procedure. No patient demonstrated a sustained rise in CD34+ cell counts as a result of the procedure. The number of CD34+ cells collected exceeded the number calculated to be in the peripheral blood at the start of the procedure by an average of 3.0-fold. The efficiency of collection for CD34+ cells averaged 92.6% and did not vary with speed of blood processing, diagnosis, or mobilization regimen. The calculated release of CD34+ cells from other reservoirs into the peripheral blood averaged 3.71 x 10(6)/min (range, 0.36-13.7 x 10(6)/min), and correlated (r = 0.82) with the concentration of these cells in the peripheral blood at the start of the procedure. These data show that the apheresis procedure used in this study does not affect the release of CD34+ cells in a cytokine-treated patient. LVL will result in collection of larger quantities of CD34+ cells than procedures involving processing of smaller volumes of blood, but the number of cells collected is limited by the rate of release of these cells into the peripheral circulation where they are accessible for collection.","['Rowley, S D', 'Yu, J', 'Gooley, T', 'Heimfeld, S', 'Holmberg, L', 'Maloney, D', 'Bensinger, W I']","['Rowley SD', 'Yu J', 'Gooley T', 'Heimfeld S', 'Holmberg L', 'Maloney D', 'Bensinger WI']","['Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, USA.']",['eng'],"['CA15704/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA18029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '5TAA004E22 (sargramostim)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)', 'PVI5M0M1GW (Filgrastim)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Antigens, CD34/analysis', 'Blood Cell Count', 'Blood Component Removal/*methods', 'Blood Platelets/cytology', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Dexamethasone/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Filgrastim', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Granulocytes/cytology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization/*methods', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/blood/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Monocytes/cytology', 'Multiple Myeloma/blood/therapy', 'Paclitaxel/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Prospective Studies', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",2001/11/13 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/11/13 10:00'],"['2000/12/20 00:00 [received]', '2001/07/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2001/11/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/13 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.bmt.1703217 [doi]'],ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2001 Oct;28(7):649-56. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1703217.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Certain factors may vary with season (e.g. infections), and we therefore investigated whether there was any evidence of seasonality of month of birth, based on data from 4199 children diagnosed with cancer under the age of 15 years. We extracted details of (i) children born 1960-95 and diagnosed 1968-95 from two population-based registries, covering the Northern (n = 2053) and Yorkshire (n = 1977) Regional Health Authority and (ii) children born in Cumbria 1950-93 and diagnosed anywhere in the UK before 1994 from a birth cohort database (n = 397). The following diagnostic categories were analysed: 0-14 years--all cancers, leukaemias, acute lymphoblastic leukaemias, central nervous system tumours, all other solid tumours; 1-6 years--leukaemias, acute lymphoblastic leukaemias. Seasonal variation was tested using Walter and Elwood's test, and logistic regression analysis allowing for cyclical variation in month of birth. No evidence of seasonality was present for any group except acute lymphoblastic leukaemia diagnosed among 1- to 6-year-olds. Seasonal trends varied by region: in the Northern and Cumbrian datasets, seasonality patterns were significant and similar (P < 0.05) with a predicted peak in early spring, whereas in Yorkshire there was less strong evidence of seasonality (P = 0.08) with a peak predicted in late summer. These findings suggest that local seasonal environmental factors operating around the time of birth are not associated with the totality of childhood cancer, but possible links with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia are supportive of a hypothesis of an infectious aetiology.","['Feltbower, R G', 'Pearce, M S', 'Dickinson, H O', 'Parker, L', 'McKinney, P A']","['Feltbower RG', 'Pearce MS', 'Dickinson HO', 'Parker L', 'McKinney PA']","['Paediatric Epidemiology Group, Unit of Epidemiology and Health Services Research, University of Leeds, 30 Hyde Terrace, Leeds LS2 9LN, UK.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Paediatr Perinat Epidemiol,Paediatric and perinatal epidemiology,8709766,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age of Onset', 'Chi-Square Distribution', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'England/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology', 'Logistic Models', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Registries/statistics & numerical data', '*Seasons', 'Time Factors']",2001/11/13 10:00,2002/01/17 10:01,['2001/11/13 10:00'],"['2001/11/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/17 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/13 10:00 [entrez]']","['377 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-3016.2001.00377.x [doi]']",ppublish,Paediatr Perinat Epidemiol. 2001 Oct;15(4):338-45. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-3016.2001.00377.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Concepts are essential in research development as they are described as the building blocks of theory. The occurrence of near death experiences (NDEs) is not an innovative subject. Parallels have existed as early as the Bible and Plato's Republic. The NDE was given further consideration in 1975 by Dr Raymond Moody who initiated an interest from the general public and researchers alike, with his book Life after Life. METHOD: This paper will use the strategy of concept analysis to find a working definition for the concept of the NDE and the implications it has for nursing. CONCLUSION: This paper will attest that the number of people who have claimed to have a NDE is phenomenal and overwhelming. In addition, it claims that the numbers of those who have experienced this phenomenon may be underestimated because of the persons' feeling of insecurity in talking with others about their paranormal incident. Therefore, it is vital that nurses become aware of the NDE and how to support the client who has had the experience. The following paper will summarize the different stages of a NDE, the consequences that one experiences, both positive and negative, and nursing implications.","['Simpson, S M']",['Simpson SM'],"['Parkview Health, Fort Wayne, Indiana 46805, USA. suzanne.simpson@parkview.com']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,J Adv Nurs,Journal of advanced nursing,7609811,,IM,"['Adaptation, Psychological', 'Adolescent', 'Aged', '*Death', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/nursing/psychology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Nursing', 'Surgical Procedures, Operative/nursing/psychology']",2001/11/13 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/11/13 10:00'],"['2001/11/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/13 10:00 [entrez]']","['2004 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2648.2001.02004.x [doi]']",ppublish,J Adv Nurs. 2001 Nov;36(4):520-6. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2648.2001.02004.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Preferential production of IL-4, IL-10 and TGFbeta occurs on donor-specific restimulation in vitro, with decreased production of IL-2, IFNgamma and TNFalpha. These effects are enhanced by simultaneous infusion of CD200 immunoadhesin (CD200Fc) and donor CD200 receptor (CD200r) bearing macrophages to transplanted mice. C57BL/6 mice do not normally resist growth of EL4 or C1498 leukaemia tumour cells. Following transplantation of cyclophosphamide-treated C57BL/6 with T-depleted C3H bone marrow cells, or for the EL4 tumour, immunization of C57BL/6 mice with tumour cells transfected with a vector encoding the co-stimulatory molecule CD80 (EL4-CD80), mice resist growth of tumour challenge. Immunization of C57BL/6 mice with EL4 cells overexpressing CD86 (EL4-CD86) is ineffective. Protection from tumour growth in either model is suppressed by infusion of CD200Fc, an effect enhanced by co-infusion of CD200r+ macrophages. CD200Fc acts on both CD4+ and CD8+ cells to produce this suppression. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that immunosuppression following CD200-CD200r interaction can regulate a functionally important tumour growth inhibition response in mice.","['Gorczynski, R M', 'Chen, Z', 'Hu, J', 'Kai, Y', 'Lei, J']","['Gorczynski RM', 'Chen Z', 'Hu J', 'Kai Y', 'Lei J']","['Department of Surgery and Immunology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada. rgorczynski@transplantunit.org']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Clin Exp Immunol,Clinical and experimental immunology,0057202,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (B7-1 Antigen)', '0 (B7-2 Antigen)', '0 (Cd86 protein, mouse)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', 'UQ4V77A8VA (antigens, CD200)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology', 'Antigens, CD/genetics', 'Antigens, Surface/genetics/*metabolism', 'B7-1 Antigen/genetics', 'B7-2 Antigen', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Graft Rejection/*immunology', 'Immune Tolerance', 'Immunization', 'Leukemia, Experimental/immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Transfection']",2001/11/13 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/11/13 10:00'],"['2001/11/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/13 10:00 [entrez]']","['1689 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2249.2001.01689.x [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Exp Immunol. 2001 Nov;126(2):220-9. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2249.2001.01689.x.,,,,,PMC1906195,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Effects of vitamin D on normal human lymphoid progenitors and B lineage acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) progenitors were assessed by using an in vitro cell colony assay specific for either B or T cell lineages. The expression of VDR on B untreated malignant progenitors at diagnosis was investigated by RT-PCR analysis. VD induced a significant inhibition of normal lymphoid cell progenitors growth of both T and B lineage. VD inhibited significantly also the growth of malignant B cell lineage lymphoid progenitors, without inducing cytotoxic effect. As it has been reported that VD effects on activated lymphocytes are mediated by 1,25-(OH)2-D3 nuclear receptor (VDR), we investigated VDR expression on malignant B cell progenitors. We did not detect VDR expression on these cells examined at diagnosis. We demonstrated that VD inhibited in vitro the clonogenic growth of both normal and malignant lymphoid B cell progenitors and that this inhibitory effect on malignant B cell progenitors was not related to VDR. Our work contributes to understanding of the mechanism of action of this hormone in promoting cellular inhibition of clonal growth of malignant lymphoid B cell progenitors, suggesting that the regulation of some critical growth and differentiation factor receptors could be a key physiological role of this hormone.","['Consolini, R', 'Pala, S', 'Legitimo, A', 'Crimaldi, G', 'Ferrari, S', 'Ferrari, S']","['Consolini R', 'Pala S', 'Legitimo A', 'Crimaldi G', 'Ferrari S', 'Ferrari S']","[""Dipartimento di Medicina della Procreazione e dell'Eta Evolutiva, Istituto di Clinica Paediatrica, Universita di Pisa, Italy. rita.consolini@dp.med.unipi.it""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Clin Exp Immunol,Clinical and experimental immunology,0057202,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Calcitriol)', '1406-16-2 (Vitamin D)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/*cytology/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Base Sequence', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Gene Expression', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Calcitriol/genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay', 'Vitamin D/*pharmacology']",2001/11/13 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/11/13 10:00'],"['2001/11/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/13 10:00 [entrez]']","['1671 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2249.2001.01671.x [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Exp Immunol. 2001 Nov;126(2):214-9. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2249.2001.01671.x.,,,,,PMC1906205,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The amidolytic activities of FVIIa and FXa were unaffected. The inhibited FVII activation in the presence of protamine was confirmed by the diminished FVIIa formation on Western blot analyses. Protamine preferentially inhibited TF-catalysed FVII activation, downregulating the extrinsic cascade.

Recent studies have demonstrated that HDAC inhibitors can be therapeutically used in various neoplastic disorders including APL. Cell differentiation was considered the major mechanism of the anti-leukaemic effects of HDAC inhibitors in APL. However, most of these studies either evaluated the effect of HDAC inhibitors in combination with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) or focused on the less common form of APL with t(11;17). To investigate the cellular effects of HDAC inhibitors, including sodium butyrate, trichostatin A, and suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA), we used two APL cell lines, NB4 and the ATRA-resistant derivative NB4.306. Moreover, primary cells from five patients with cytogenetic evidence for t(15;17) were also studied. Our results demonstrated that HDAC inhibitors induce distinct caspase-dependent apoptosis in APL, which showed both concentration-and time-dependence. In addition, changes in the apoptosis-regulatory proteins, daxx, bcl-2 and bax were analysed. HDAC inhibitors induced downregulation of daxx, but no significant changes were detected in bcl-2 or bax.

We have analysed the functional capability of DC generated in vitro from blood CD14(+) cells of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) patients and healthy donors by culturing for 10 d with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interleukin 4 (IL-4) and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). Two distinct DC populations were identified in patients as well as in controls. The majority of DC expressed CD11c and a minority also CD123. Most of the DC generated from both patients and controls exhibited a mature phenotype indicated by CD83 and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II expression, as well as by a characteristic morphology. Less than 1% of DC exhibited CD14. CLL DC had a similar expression of accessory molecules (CD54, CD80 and CD86) as control DC. The mean fluorescence intensity of CD80 and MHC class I molecules was significantly higher on CLL DC than on control DC (P < 0.05). At the gene level (real-time polymerase chain reaction) the expression of IL-10 was higher in CLL (P = 0.028) than in control DC. IL-1 beta and IL-12p(35) transcripts were also more abundant in CLL than in control DC but did not reach statistical significance. The expression of IL-4 and TNF-alpha was similar to that of control DC. The interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) gene expression level in CLL DC was decreased compared with control DC. DC of CLL patients had a similar capacity to stimulate in mixed leucocyte reaction as well as to present a recall antigen (PPD) as control DC. Thus, DC of CLL patients seem to have a normal function and may serve as antigen preserving cells for presentation of tumour antigens in a therapeutic vaccination approach. The mechanisms behind the observed increase in some surface molecules and the abnormal cytokine profile of CLL DC is not clear but might indicate pre-activation of DC in vivo, which may have a regulatory role in the pathobiology of CLL.","['Rezvany, M R', 'Jeddi-Tehrani, M', 'Biberfeld, P', 'Soderlund, J', 'Mellstedt, H', 'Osterborg, A', 'Rabbani, H']","['Rezvany MR', 'Jeddi-Tehrani M', 'Biberfeld P', 'Soderlund J', 'Mellstedt H', 'Osterborg A', 'Rabbani H']","['Immune and Gene Therapy Laboratory CCK, Karolinska Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharide Receptors)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antigen Presentation', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Differentiation/immunology', 'Cytokines/biosynthesis', 'Dendritic Cells/*immunology/pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology', 'Lipopolysaccharide Receptors/blood', 'Lymphocyte Culture Test, Mixed', 'Male', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology']",2001/11/13 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/11/13 10:00'],"['2001/11/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/13 10:00 [entrez]']","['3117 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2001.03117.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2001 Nov;115(2):263-71. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2001.03117.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has been shown to confer resistance to mitoxantrone, topotecan, doxorubicin and daunorubicin in human tumour cell lines. We describe a study of BCRP expression in blast cells derived from 20 patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). Twelve samples were from patients who had received previous cytotoxic therapy. BCRP expression was measured by immunocytochemistry using the BXP-34 monoclonal antibody. In vitro drug sensitivity was assessed using the methyl thiazol tetrazoliumbromide assay. BCRP expression varied between patients, and six out of 22 (27%) samples had > 10% cells staining positively (median 37%, range 13-95%). BCRP positivity was seen in both de novo samples and those from previously treated patients. There was a marked variation in the effect of all drugs tested between patients. Although there was no correlation between BCRP positivity and the effect of mitoxantrone, topotecan or doxorubicin, the median daunorubicin LC(50) value of BCRP(+) cells was fourfold higher than that of BCRP- cells (0.89 micromol/l compared with 0.21 micromol/l, P < 0.05). These results suggest that BCRP may be involved in resistance to the agents commonly used in AML and may explain some of the anomalous results found when studying other membrane transporters, such as P-gp or MRP.","['Sargent, J M', 'Williamson, C J', 'Maliepaard, M', 'Elgie, A W', 'Scheper, R J', 'Taylor, C G']","['Sargent JM', 'Williamson CJ', 'Maliepaard M', 'Elgie AW', 'Scheper RJ', 'Taylor CG']","['Haematology Research, Pembury Hospital, Kent, UK. jean.sargent@btinternet.com']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (ABCG2 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2)', '0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2', 'ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/*metabolism', 'Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Daunorubicin/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/physiology', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/11/13 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/11/13 10:00'],"['2001/11/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/13 10:00 [entrez]']","['3122 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2001.03122.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2001 Nov;115(2):257-62. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2001.03122.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Selective release of cytotoxic platinum-spermidine species through hydrolytic cleavage of carbamates.,6108-14,"BBR3464 is a novel trinuclear platinum drug currently in Phase II clinical trials. Polyamine-bridged dinuclear platinum compounds as represented by [[trans-Pt(NH(3))(2)Cl](2)-mu-spermidine-N(1),N(8)]Cl(3) (1) are highly interesting second-generation analogues of BBR3464 because the hydrogen-bonding and electrostatic contributions of the central platinum-amine group in BBR3464 are replicated by the free, noncoordinated ""central"" quaternary nitrogens of the linear polyamine linker while the presence of two separate Pt-Cl bonds maintains the bifunctional binding mode on the DNA adducts. Preclinical investigations confirm the potency of these species with cytotoxicity in the nanomolar range. This remarkable potency results in a relatively narrow therapeutic index. To enhance the therapeutic index of these drugs, we investigated the potential for ""pro-drug"" delivery of less toxic and better tolerated derivatives such as the compounds [[trans-Pt(NH(3))(2)Cl](2)-mu-N(4)-R-spermidine-N(1),N(8)]Cl(2) where N(4)-R represents BOC (tert-butyl), CBz (benzyl), and Fmoc (fluorenylmethyl) carbamate blocking groups, 2-4, respectively. The bulky Fmoc derivative showed evidence for conformational isomers by (1)H NMR spectroscopy due to the inequivalence of the two n-propyl and n-butyl side chains of the spermidine moiety. The rate constants for hydrolysis and release of 1 were calculated. Release of cytotoxic 1 at physiologically relevant pH followed the order 4 > 2 > 3. The calculated values for 4 (pH 5, 6.0(+/-3.9) x 10(-10) s(-1); pH 6, 6.5(+/-0.2) x 10(-9) s(-1); pH 7, 6.0(+/-0.2) x 10(-8) s(-1); pH 8, 1.6(+/-0.1) x 10(-7) s(-1)) show a more pronounced pH dependence compared to 2 (pH 5, 4.6(+/-0.1) x 10(-8) s(-1); pH 6, 4.2(+/-0.1) x 10(-8) s(-1); pH 7, 3.2(+/-0.1) x 10(-8) s(-1)). Preliminary biological assays of cellular uptake and cytotoxicity confirm the utility of the pro-drug concept. While blocked-polyamine compounds such as 2-4 are, in general, 2-3 orders of magnitude less cytotoxic than 1, there is significant cell type variability. Specifically, the Fmoc derivative 4 showed significantly enhanced cytotoxicity warranting further study of the pro-drug concept for greater selectivity and/or oral delivery.","['Hegmans, A', 'Qu, Y', 'Kelland, L R', 'Roberts, J D', 'Farrell, N']","['Hegmans A', 'Qu Y', 'Kelland LR', 'Roberts JD', 'Farrell N']","['Department of Chemistry and Internal Medicine and the Massey Cancer Center, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, Virginia 23284-2006, USA.']",['eng'],['R01-CA78754/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Inorg Chem,Inorganic chemistry,0366543,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Carbamates)', '0 (Organoplatinum Compounds)', '0 (Polyamines)', '0 (Prodrugs)', '2FZ7Y3VOQX (Spermine)', 'HAJ1000ARC (BBR 3464)', 'U87FK77H25 (Spermidine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Carbamates/chemistry', 'Catalysis', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Hydrolysis', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Leukemia L1210', 'Mice', 'Molecular Structure', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, Biomolecular', 'Organoplatinum Compounds/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Ovarian Neoplasms', 'Polyamines/chemical synthesis/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Prodrugs/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Spermidine/*chemistry/pharmacology', 'Spermine/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Stereoisomerism', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Temperature', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",2001/11/13 10:00,2002/01/31 10:01,['2001/11/13 10:00'],"['2001/11/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/31 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/13 10:00 [entrez]']","['ic010509a [pii]', '10.1021/ic010509a [doi]']",ppublish,Inorg Chem. 2001 Nov 19;40(24):6108-14. doi: 10.1021/ic010509a.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Approximately 30% of MDS evolve into acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). In this review, we intend to delineate the genetic events, which may drive this sequence and therefore we will focus primarily on cytogenetic abnormalities where the genes have been identified and oncogenes and suppressor genes that have been implicated. In terms of the biological mechanisms, which characterise this process, it is generally thought that the MDS cell has impaired differentiation, and has increased apoptosis. As the disease progresses in addition, the cells have increased proliferation. As the disease evolves, the population of cells, which predominate remain immature, have decreased apoptosis and in many cases, upregulate anti-apoptotic genes and have deregulated proliferation as the number of blast cells increase. Etiological factors, which contribute to the development of leukemia, include therapeutic agents administered for a primary malignancy.

Clearly, MDS represent a heterogeneous group of disorders, and no uniform etiology or treatment can be prescribed for all patients. This further underscores the need for MDS patients to be seen at specialized centers and placed on experimental protocols if they need treatment. The important thing to remember is that ultimately, the patient must remain the measure of all things, and must be given all the therapeutic choices including that of waiting and watching with supportive care alone. Recent biologic insights have expanded the therapeutic options, but no curative therapies except stem cell transplants are available at this time.

Hyperdiploidy and/or t(12;21) are associated with good prognosis, whereas t(9;22) and/or rearrangements of MLL gene correlate with poor outcome and therefore early detection of these abnormalities is very important. FISH can overcome some limitations of conventional cytogenetic and molecular-genetic analyses and due to high sensitivity specific chromosomal aberrations in mitoses and/or interphase nuclei can be detected. In the Center of Oncocytogenetics of the 3rd Medical Department for assessment of hyperdiploidy and structural rearrangements we use double-color FISH with centromeric and/or locus-specific probes and complex aberrations are ascertained by whole chromosome painting probes and multicolor FISH. Among 275 children with ALL examined during the last 8 years by different FISH methods we found seven patients with translocation t(9;22) and 14 patients with MLL rearrangements in bone marrow cells. Since 1988 we focus on detection of hyperdiploidy and/or t(12;21). High hyperdiploidy was found in 35 children, 10 of them had further complex rearrangements. Translocation t(12;21) was proved in 37 patients and complex rearrangements were found in 22 of them.

RESULTS: We found a predominance of peripheral CD8+ T lymphocytes and, at the same time, studying the cellular profile of the blister fluid, just in the beginning of blister eruption, we also found a high proportion of CD8+ T lymphocytes, mainly CD8+CD57-.

Northern blot analysis revealed a single GTPCH mRNA transcript that was confirmed by RNase protection assay to encode for Type 1 GTPCH; no alternatively spliced forms of GTPCH mRNA were detected with this assay. Incubation with 8Br-cAMP, but not nerve growth factor or leukemia inhibitory factor, produced a rapid increase in GTPCH mRNA and protein levels; protein levels remained elevated during the entire treatment period while mRNA content declined rapidly between 10 and 24 h. Treatment with 8Br-cAMP did not significantly modify the stability of GTPCH mRNA but did increase GTPCH transcription as determined by transient transfection assays of a luciferase reporter construct containing 1171 bp of human GTPCH 5'-flanking sequence. Cis-acting elements required for maximal basal and cAMP-dependent transcription were localized by deletion analysis to the 146 bp proximal promoter. DNase I footprint analysis of the proximal promoter using SK-N-BE(2)M17 nuclear extracts identified two protein binding domains: one an upstream Sp1-like site and the other a combined CRE-Sp1-CCAAT-box element. EMSA and supershift assays demonstrated that the combined CRE-Sp1-CCAAT-box element recruits ATF-2 and NF-Y but not Sp1-4 or Egr-1-3. NF-Y binding was confirmed using pure recombinant human NF-Y protein. Transcription of the human GTPCH gene in human SK-N-BE(2)M17 cells is thus enhanced by cAMP acting through regulatory elements located in the proximal promoter and may involve the transcription factors NF-Y and ATF-2.","['Hirayama, K', 'Shimoji, M', 'Swick, L', 'Meyer, A', 'Kapatos, G']","['Hirayama K', 'Shimoji M', 'Swick L', 'Meyer A', 'Kapatos G']","['Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Neurosciences and Center for Molecular Medicine and Genetics, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, Michigan 48201, USA.']",['eng'],['NS26081/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,J Neurochem,Journal of neurochemistry,2985190R,"['0 (ATF2 protein, human)', '0 (Activating Transcription Factor 2)', '0 (Biogenic Monoamines)', '0 (CCAAT-Binding Factor)', '0 (Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (nuclear factor Y)', '22150-76-1 (Biopterin)', '23583-48-4 (8-Bromo Cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate)', 'EC 3.1.- (Ribonucleases)', 'EC 3.5.4.16 (GTP Cyclohydrolase)', 'EGX657432I (sapropterin)']",IM,"['8-Bromo Cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate/*pharmacology', 'Activating Transcription Factor 2', 'Alternative Splicing/physiology', 'Base Sequence', 'Biogenic Monoamines/metabolism', 'Biopterin/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'Blotting, Northern', 'CCAAT-Binding Factor/metabolism', 'Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein/metabolism', 'DNA Footprinting', 'GTP Cyclohydrolase/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neuroblastoma', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/drug effects/*physiology', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Ribonucleases', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/11/10 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/11/10 10:00'],"['2001/11/10 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/10 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1471-4159.2001.00583.x [doi]'],ppublish,J Neurochem. 2001 Nov;79(3):576-87. doi: 10.1046/j.1471-4159.2001.00583.x.,,,['J Neurochem 2002 Mar;80(5):938-9'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

GH peaks and IGF-I were correlated positively (P = 0.0001) and negatively with dose (P < 0.001 for GH and P = 0.0001 for IGF-I), but not with age at irradiation. Among the 43 patients with GH peaks below 3 microg/liter, 41 (95%) had plasma IGF-I less than -2 zs. The body mass index (BMI), plasma insulin, and leptin were similar in the four groups. They were positively correlated with each other (P < 0.001 for BMI compared with insulin and with leptin, respectively, and P < 0.01 for insulin compared with leptin), but not with age or dose of irradiation, or with markers of GH secretion. In conclusion, in patients with GH deficiency caused by cranial irradiation, the residual GH secretion and plasma IGF-I depend on the dose. Almost all the patients with severe GH deficiency had low plasma IGF-I.

Data sources were published literature identified from the Medline database from January 1966 to December 2000, bibliographic references, and textbooks. Reports from preclinical and clinical trials were selected. Study designs and results were extracted from trial reports. Statistical evaluation or meta-analysis of combined results was not attempted. Androgenic anabolic steroids (AAS) are widely prescribed for the treatment of male hypogonadism; however, they may play a significant role in the treatment of other conditions as well, such as cachexia associated with human immunodeficiency virus, cancer, burns, renal and hepatic failure, and anemia associated with leukemia or kidney failure. A review of the anabolic effects of androgens and their efficacy in the treatment of these conditions is provided. In addition, the numerous and sometimes serious side effects that have been known to occur with androgen use are reviewed. Although the threat of various side effects is present, AAS therapy appears to have a favorable anabolic effect on patients with chronic diseases and muscle catabolism. We recommend that AAS can be used for the treatment of patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome wasting and in severely catabolic patients with severe burns. Preliminary data in renal failure-associated wasting are also positive. Advantages and disadvantages should be weighed carefully when comparing AAS therapy to other weight-gaining measures. Although a conservative approach to the use of AAS in patients with chronic diseases is still recommended, the utility of AAS therapy in the attenuation of severe weight loss associated with disease states such as cancer, postoperative recovery, and wasting due to pulmonary and hepatic disease should be more thoroughly investigated.","['Basaria, S', 'Wahlstrom, J T', 'Dobs, A S']","['Basaria S', 'Wahlstrom JT', 'Dobs AS']","['The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland 21287, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,J Clin Endocrinol Metab,The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,0375362,"['0 (Anabolic Agents)', '0 (Androgens)']",IM,"['Anabolic Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Androgens/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Animals', 'Chronic Disease/*drug therapy', 'Humans']",2001/11/10 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/11/10 10:00'],"['2001/11/10 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/10 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1210/jcem.86.11.7983 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Endocrinol Metab. 2001 Nov;86(11):5108-17. doi: 10.1210/jcem.86.11.7983.,,127,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One of the basic concepts of gene therapy is to transform viruses into genetic shuttles, which will deliver the gene of interest into the target cells. Based on the nature of the viral genome, these gene therapy vectors can be divided into RNA and DNA viral vectors. The majority of RNA virus-based vectors have been derived from simple retroviruses like murine leukemia virus. A major shortcoming of these vectors is that they are not able to transduce nondividing cells. This problem may be overcome by the use of novel retroviral vectors derived from lentiviruses, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The most commonly used DNA virus vectors are based on adenoviruses and adeno-associated viruses. Although the available vector systems are able to deliver genes in vivo into cells, the ideal delivery vehicle has not been found. Thus, the present viral vectors should be used only with great caution in human beings and further progress in vector development is necessary.","['Pfeifer, A', 'Verma, I M']","['Pfeifer A', 'Verma IM']","['The Salk Institute, La Jolla, California 92037, USA. apfeifer@ems.salk.edu']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Annu Rev Genomics Hum Genet,Annual review of genomics and human genetics,100911346,,IM,"['DNA Viruses/genetics', '*Genetic Therapy', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'RNA Viruses/genetics']",2001/11/10 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/11/10 10:00'],"['2001/11/10 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/10 10:00 [entrez]']","['2/1/177 [pii]', '10.1146/annurev.genom.2.1.177 [doi]']",ppublish,Annu Rev Genomics Hum Genet. 2001;2:177-211. doi: 10.1146/annurev.genom.2.1.177.,,186,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The viruses described here have a different pattern of geographical distribution, and the disease manifestations may vary according to environmental and/or genetic characteristics of the host. Epstein-Barr virus, a linear double-stranded DNA virus (herpesvirus), and the human T-cell leukemia virus, a retrovirus with a single-stranded diploid RNA genome, are associated among other diseases with lymphoma and leukemia/lymphoma, respectively. Both viruses cause a lifelong infection, but only a small percentage of infected individuals develop hematopoietic neoplasms. Epidemiological data suggest that the time of infection may be important in determining disease outcome in both HTLV-I and EBV infection. The pathogenic mechanisms used by these viruses are of most interest since they may recapitulate growth dysregulation steps also occurring in other hematopoietic malignancies. In Section I Dr. Franchini reviews the biology, genetics and diseases associated with HTLV-I and HTLV-II. In Section II, Dr. Ambinder reviews the biology of EBV infection and its relationship to the pathogenesis of Hodgkin's disease and other malignancies. In Section III, Dr. Barry reviews the viral hemorrhagic fevers caused by RNA viruses such as Arenaviridae, Bunyaviridae, Filoviridae, and Flaviviridae, which can lead to acute syndromes that can be fatal. However, prompt diagnosis is key for patient management as well as for limiting their spread to others. These syndromes have become the focus of public concern and represent not only a clinical challenge, since in most cases no specific antiviral treatment is available, but also a challenge for future basic research on their biology and pathogenesis since little is known at present.","['Franchini, Genoveffa', 'Ambinder, Richard F.', 'Barry, Michele']","['Franchini G', 'Ambinder RF', 'Barry M']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Hematology Am Soc Hematol Educ Program,Hematology.

The increase in the understanding of the role of growth factors and their receptors in the pathogenesis of malignancy and other undesirable hematological events taken in conjunction with the ability to produce humanized chimeric monoclonal antibodies to these targets is providing a new perspective for the treatment of leukemia, lymphoma and breast cancer, autoimmune disease and for prevention of ischemic complications. Dr. Waldmann describes approaches targeting the Her2/neu and the II-2/IL-15 receptor systems. The Her2/neu receptor is overexpressed in select breast, ovarian, gastric and pancreatic neoplasms. The use of trastuzumab (Herceptin) in the treatment of patients with breast cancer whose tumors overexpress this receptor are reviewed. The IL-2 receptor (Tac) is expressed on select malignant cells (adult T cell leukemia, hairy cell leukemia) and activated T cells involved in autoimmune disease and organ rejection. Humanized anti-Tac alone (daclizumab, Zenapax) or armed with toxins or radionuclides have been used successfully in the treatment of leukemia.

With this knowledge comes the challenge of improving the effectiveness and safety of the approach and of simplifying the methodologies required whilst still meeting appropriate federal regulatory guidelines. This review provides an overview of the current status of cellular immunotherapies and addresses how they may be implemented and the future directions they are likely to take. In Section I, Dr. Brenner with Drs. Rossig and Sili reviews the clinical experience to date with adoptive transfer of viral antigen-specific T cells for the successful treatment of Epstein-Barr virus-associated malignancies as well as viral infectious diseases. Genetic modification of the T cell receptor of the infused cells to potentiate such T cells as well as modifications to improve safety of the infusions are described. In Section II, Dr. Young describes the hematopoietic lineages of human dendritic cells and some of their immunotherapeutic applications. The critical importance of dendritic cells to T cell immunity and the capacity to generate dendritic cells in large numbers has spawned enormous interest in the use of these specialized leukocytes to manipulate cellular immunity. Successful cytokine-driven differentiation of dendritic cells reveal two types, myeloid- and plasmacytoid or lymphoid-related dendritic cells. The effects of maturation on phenotype and function of the dendritic cells and their use as immune adjuvants in dendritic cell vaccines to elicit antitumor and antiviral immunity are reviewed. In Section III, Professor Goulmy illustrates some current and future approaches towards tumor-specific cellular therapy of hematopoietic malignancy. Minor histocompatibility antigen (mHag) disparities between HLA-matched bone marrow donor and recipient can induce allo-responses that may participate in post bone marrow transplantation (BMT) graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) reactivities. A lack of such allo-reactivity may result in relapse of leukemia after BMT. In these patients, adoptive immunotherapy with cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) specific for hematopoietic system-restricted mHags may be used as an extension of current efforts using immunotherapy with donor lymphocyte infusions. Adoptive immunotherapy with CTLs specific for the hematopoietic system-restricted mHags, however, offers the prospect of greater and more predictable effectiveness in the absence of graft-versus-host disease.","['Brenner, Malcolm', 'Rossig, Claudia', 'Sili, Uluhan', 'Young, James W.', 'Goulmy, Els']","['Brenner M', 'Rossig C', 'Sili U', 'Young JW', 'Goulmy E']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Hematology Am Soc Hematol Educ Program,Hematology.

Specifically, the focus may shift away from current intensive therapies for ultra low-risk patients and away from transplantation for certain patients at relapse. In contrast, infants with ALL comprise an ultra high-risk population in need of specialized approaches. In Section I Dr. Lange describes the need to identify ultra low-risk children. Groups around the world have improved the outcome of children with ALL by identifying the basic ""total therapy"" model of the 1970s and stratifying treatment according to risk of relapse. Current first-line treatment cures about 85% of children with standard-risk ALL and 70% of children with high-risk disease. However, all children receive anthracyclines, alkylating agents, or moderate- to high-dose antimetabolite infusions. While randomized clinical trials prove that these intensifications reduce relapses, they also show that half of all children with ALL can be cured with the modest therapy of the 1970s and early 1980s. The patients curable with lesser therapy may be considered an ultra low-risk group. Attempts to use age, gender, white count, morphology, and karyotype to identify the ultra low-risk group of patients with a 90-95% cure rate with minimal therapy have failed. An expanded repertoire of tools such as pharmacogenetic profiling, PCR measurement of minimal residual disease and microarray technology may make this goal achievable in this decade. In section II Dr. Chessells addresses the management of children with relapsed ALL. The chance of successful re-treatment with conventional chemotherapy for relapse depends on the duration of first remission and the site of relapse. Bone marrow transplantation from a histocompatible sibling or other suitable donor, which is widely accepted as the treatment of choice for children with a first remission of < 24 months, is associated with a high risk of relapse. Bone marrow transplantation for later bone marrow relapse improves leukemia-free survival but has significant short-term and long-term toxicities. The challenges are to develop more effective treatment for early relapse and to identify those children with relapsed ALL who are curable with chemotherapy or, failing this, those children who would be candidates for bone marrow transplantation in third remission. In Section III Dr. Felix addresses the problem of infant ALL. ALL of infancy is clinically aggressive, and infants continue to have the worst prognosis of all pediatric patients with ALL. High white blood cell count, younger age, bulky extramedullary disease, and CNS disease at diagnosis are unfavorable characteristics. These features occur with MLL gene translocations. The probability of an MLL gene translocation and the probability of poor outcome both are greatest in younger infants. Specialized intensive chemotherapy approaches and bone marrow transplantation in first remission for this disease may lead to improved survival. Refined recognition of pediatric patients with ALL who need more and less intensive therapies is necessary to increase survival and decrease toxicities.","['Felix, Carolyn A.', 'Lange, Beverly J.', 'Chessells, Judith M.']","['Felix CA', 'Lange BJ', 'Chessells JM']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Hematology Am Soc Hematol Educ Program,Hematology.

In Section I, Dr. Linch reviews the current status of Hodgkin's disease treatment. Survival rates have improved over the last three decades due both to better initial therapies and associated supportive care and to the success of salvage therapy. Unlike most other malignancies, a similar survival endpoint can be achieved by different means, e.g., intensive initial therapy resulting in a low relapse rate or less intensive initial therapy and more reliance on salvage therapy. Overall survival has thus become a difficult end-point for clinical trials of primary therapy, and the value of disease-free survival as an end-point can also be questioned. Quality-of-life issues are to the fore of clinical decision and include the psychological trauma of relapse and fertility status. Patient choice is increasingly important. The high level of success in treating Hodgkin's disease also means that attention must be focused on the very long term results and in this context the occurrence of second malignancies is a major issue. In Section II, Dr. Gosden with Dr. Tulandi and Dr. Tan review the risks of infertility following radio-therapy and chemotherapy and address the actions that can be taken to overcome this problem, particularly for females and prepubertal boys and girls. Particular attention is paid to the recent developments in ovarian cryopreservation and harvesting immature germ cells. In Section III, Dr. Hancock gives a comprehensive update of the incidence of secondary acute leukemia, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and solid tumors in a large population of patients treated for Hodgkin's disease. The roles of radiotherapy, chemotherapy and combined modality treatment as risk factors contributing to the development of these secondary malignancies are reviewed. The importance of efforts to prevent late-occurring solid tumors such as lung cancer through smoking cessation programs and early detection by screening for cancers of the breast, thyroid and skin are emphasized.","['Linch, David C.', 'Gosden, Roger G.', 'Tulandi, Togas', 'Tan, Seang-Lin', 'Hancock, Stephen L.']","['Linch DC', 'Gosden RG', 'Tulandi T', 'Tan SL', 'Hancock SL']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Hematology Am Soc Hematol Educ Program,Hematology.

In Section III Dr. Giralt presents an update on the results of unrelated donor transplantion, donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI) and non-ablative stem cell transplantation (NST) in CML. The roles of CD8-depletion, dose escalation and the transduction of suicide genes in treatment with DLI are addressed. Early results of NST in CML show that it is feasible and can result in long-term disease control. In Section IV Drs. Kantarjian and Talpaz review the results of IFN-alpha plus low-dose cytosine arabinoside and other promising modalities for CML including homoharringtonine, decitabine, and polyethylene glycol-interferon. In Section V they present an update on the recent experience with STI571. Objective but transient responses have been seen in 40% to 50% of patients in CML blastic phase. In accelerated phase, the response rate with STI571 exceeds 70%, and these responses are durable. In chronic phase CML, STI571 at 300 mg daily in patients who failed IFN-alpha produces a complete hematologic response (CHR) in over 90% of patients. Early results suggest cytogenetic response rates of approximately 50%, which may be major in approximately 30%. The maturing results with STI571 may soon change current recommendations regarding the relative roles of established modalities such as allogeneic SCT and IFN-alpha. Important questions include 1) whether STI571 therapy alone may be sufficient to induce long-term survival and event-free survival in CML, or whether it needs to be combined simultaneously or sequentially with IFN-alpha and cytosine arabinoside; and 2) what should the indications for frontline allogeneic SCT be in relation to STI571 therapy.","['Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Melo, Junia V.', 'Tura, Sante', 'Giralt, Sergio', 'Talpaz, Moshe']","['Kantarjian H', 'Melo JV', 'Tura S', 'Giralt S', 'Talpaz M']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Hematology Am Soc Hematol Educ Program,Hematology.

However, a high percentage of patients still remain refractory to primary therapy or relapse later. This review examines the search for new agents and new modes of therapy. In Section I, Dr. Estey discusses new agents directed at various targets, such as CD33, angiogenesis, inappropriately methylated (suppressor) genes, cell cycle checkpoints, proteosomes, multidrug resistance (MDR) gene, mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. He also reviews preliminary results of phase I trials with the nucleoside analog troxacitabine and liposomal anthracyclin and suggests new strategies for trials of new agents. In Section II, Dr. Jones revisits differentiation therapy and presents results of preclinical and clinical studies that demonstrate that a variety of clinically applicable cell cycle inhibitors (interferon, phenylbutyrate, vitamin D, retinoids, bryostatin-1) preferentially augments growth factor-mediated induction of myeloid leukemia terminal differentiation, as well as blocks growth factors' effects on leukemia proliferation. The combination of cell cycle inhibition plus myeloid growth factors may offer a potential treatment for resistant myeloid leukemias. In Section III, Drs. Levitsky and Borrello address the question of tumor vaccination in AML and shows that, although tumor rejection antigens in AML have not been formally identified to date, a growing number of attractive candidates are ripe for testing with defined antigen-specific vaccine strategies. Interestingly, the ability to drive leukemic blasts to differentiate into competent antigen presenting cells such as dendritic cells may be exploited in the creation of cellular vaccines. Ultimately, the successful development of active immunotherapy for AML will require integration with dose-intensive chemotherapy, necessitating a more complete understanding of host immune reconstitution. In Section IV, Dr. Slavin reviews the concept of delivering non-myeloablative stem cell transplantation (NST) and delayed lymphocyte infusion (DLI) to increase tolerance in particular in high risk and older patients, and take advantage of the graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect. All these approaches hold promise in reducing morbidity and mortality and differ from the older concepts aiming at delivering the highest possible doses of chemotherapy and/or total body irradiation to reach maximum leukemia cell kill, whatever the toxicity to the patient.","['Gorin, Norbert C.', 'Estey, Elihu', 'Jones, Richard J.', 'Levitsky, Hyam I.', 'Borrello, Ivan', 'Slavin, Shimon']","['Gorin NC', 'Estey E', 'Jones RJ', 'Levitsky HI', 'Borrello I', 'Slavin S']","['Johns Hopkins Oncology Center, 1650 Orleans Street, Room 254, Baltimore MD 21231.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Hematology Am Soc Hematol Educ Program,Hematology.

In Section I, Dr. Pearson, with Drs. Messinezy and Westwood, reviews the diagnostic challenge of the investigation of patients with a raised hematocrit. The suggested approach divides patients on their red cell mass (RCM) results into those with absolute (raised RCM) and apparent (normal RCM) erythrocytosis. A standardized series of investigations is proposed for those with an absolute erythrocytosis to confirm the presence of a primary (PV) or secondary erythrocytosis, with abnormal and normal erythropoietic compartments respectively, leaving a heterogenous group, idiopathic erythrocytosis, where the cause cannot be established. Since there is no single diagnostic test for PV, its presence is confirmed following the use of updated diagnostic criteria and confirmatory marrow histology. In Section II, Dr. Green with Drs. Bench, Huntly, and Nacheva reviews the evidence from studies of X chromosome inactivation patterns that support the concept that PV results from clonal expansion of a transformed hemopoietic stem cell. Analyses of the pattern of erythroid and myeloid colony growth have demonstrated abnormal responses to several cytokines, raising the possibility of a defect in a signal transduction pathway shared by several growth factors. A number of cytogenetic and molecular approaches are now focused on defining the molecular lesion(s). In the last section, Dr. Barbui with Dr. Finazzi addresses the complications of PV, notably thrombosis, myelofibrosis and acute leukemia. Following an evaluation of published data, a management approach is proposed. All patients should undergo phlebotomy to keep the hematocrit (Hct) below 0.45, which may be all that is required in those at low thrombotic risk and with stable disease. In those at high thrombotic risk or with progressive thrombocytosis or splenomegaly, a myelosuppressive agent should be used. Hydroxyurea has a role at all ages, but (32)P or busulfan may be used in the elderly. In younger patients, interferon-alpha or anagrelide should be considered. Low-dose aspirin should be used in those with thrombotic or ischemic complications.","['Pearson, Thomas C.', 'Messinezy, Maria', 'Westwood, Nigel', 'Green, Anthony R.', 'Bench, Anthony J.', 'Green, Anthony R.', 'Huntly, Brian J.P.', 'Nacheva, Elizabeth P.', 'Barbui, Tiziano', 'Finazzi, Guido']","['Pearson TC', 'Messinezy M', 'Westwood N', 'Green AR', 'Bench AJ', 'Green AR', 'Huntly BJ', 'Nacheva EP', 'Barbui T', 'Finazzi G']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Hematology Am Soc Hematol Educ Program,Hematology.

In Section I, Dr. Young summarizes the current knowledge of acquired aplastic anemia. In most patients, an autoimmune mechanism has been inferred from positive responses to nontransplant therapies and laboratory data. Cytotoxic T cell attack, with production of type I cytokines, leads to hematopoietic stem cell destruction and ultimately pancytopenia; this underlying mechanism is similar to other human disorders of lymphocyte-mediated, tissue-specific organ destruction (diabetes, multiple sclerosis, uveitis, colitis, etc.). The antigen that incites disease is unknown in aplastic anemia as in other autoimmune diseases; post-hepatitis aplasia is an obvious target for virus discovery. Aplastic anemia can be effectively treated by either stem cell transplantation or immunosuppression. Results of recent trials with antilymphocyte globulins and high dose cyclophosphamide are reviewed. Dr. Abkowitz discusses the diagnosis and clinical approach to patients with acquired pure red cell aplasia, both secondary and idiopathic, in Section II. The pathophysiology of various PRCA syndromes including immunologic inhibition of red cell differentiation, viral infection (especially human parvovirus B19), and myelodysplasia are discussed. An animal model of PRCA (secondary to infection with feline leukemia virus [FeLV], subgroup C) is presented. Understanding the mechanisms by which erythropoiesis is impaired provides for insights into the process of normal red cell differentiation, as well as a rational strategy for patient management. Among the acquired cytopenias paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is relatively rare; however, it can pose formidable management problems. Since its first recognition as a disease, PNH has been correctly classified as a hemolytic anemia; however, the frequent co-existence of other cytopenias has hinted strongly at a more complex pathogenesis. In Section III, Dr. Luzzatto examines recent progress in this area, with special emphasis on the somatic mutations in the PIG-A gene and resulting phenotypes. Animal models of PNH and the association of PNH with bone marrow failure are also reviewed. Expansion of PNH clones must reflect somatic cell selection, probably as part of an autoimmune process. Outstanding issues in treatment are illustrated through clinical cases of PNH. Biologic inferences from PNH may be relevant to our understanding of more common marrow failure syndromes like myelodysplasia.","['Young, Neal S.', 'Abkowitz, Janis L.', 'Luzzatto, Lucio']","['Young NS', 'Abkowitz JL', 'Luzzatto L']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Hematology Am Soc Hematol Educ Program,Hematology.

In this study the cytochrome P450 isozymes involved in the metabolism of phenol were examined in hepatic and pulmonary microsomes utilizing chemical inhibitors of CYP2E1, CYP2B, and CYP2F2 and using CYP2E1 knockout mice.

Previous studies have failed to detect NQO1 in freshly aspirated bone marrow including Ficoll-purified mononuclear cells and purified CD34(+) hematopoietic progenitor stem cells. In these studies we examined human bone marrow core biopsies by immunohistochemistry using monoclonal antibodies directed against NQO1. These studies revealed that NQO1 was expressed in human bone marrow but expression of NQO1 was limited to bone marrow endothelium and adipocytes. To confirm the expression of NQO1 in bone marrow endothelial cells we examined an immortalized human bone marrow endothelial cell line (HBMEC-60) for NQO1 protein expression. Immunoblot analysis and an activity assay confirmed the expression of NQO1 in HBMEC-60. These data demonstrate that NQO1 is present in human bone marrow.

Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a major angiogenic factor that regulates multiple endothelial cell functions, including mitogenesis. Cellular and circulating levels of VEGF are elevated in hematologic malignancies and are adversely associated with prognosis. Angiogenesis is a very complex, tightly regulated, multistep process, the targeting of which may well prove useful in the creation of novel therapeutic agents.

It is a central element in embryogenesis, ovulation, wound healing, diabetic retinopathy, and rheumatoid arthritis and in the establishment and spread of malignant tumors. Angiogenic factors include direct angiogens, indirect angiogens, and integrins. Direct angiogens stimulate the formation of new blood vessels directly. Indirect angiogens promote neovascular formation by paracrine stimulation of direct angiogens. Integrins mediate interactions between the developing vessels and components of the extracellular matrix. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a principal direct angiogen. By binding to 1 of 3 receptors (VEGFR-1, -2, or -3), it influences vasculogenesis during embryogenesis, physiologic and neoplastic angiogenesis, and lymphangiogenesis. Although the importance of angiogenesis in solid tumors has been recognized for some time, its exact significance in hematologic malignancies is less clear. Evidence now suggests that VEGF has a major role in the development and progression of hematologic malignancies such as acute leukemia, chronic leukemia, myelodysplasia, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and multiple myeloma.

The bone marrow microenvironment is the setting for a wealth of complex interactions that include cell-to-cell contacts as well as secretion of and response to soluble factors. Abundant evidence supports the role of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) in contributing to the dysregulation of apoptosis that is the hallmark of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). In fact, CLL cells themselves express bFGF; intracellular levels of this cytokine correlate with clinical CLL stage. Other stromal factors mediate the inhibition of apoptosis in CLL as well, suggesting that strategies to block the responses of CLL cells to these factors may represent effective therapies. More broadly, the class of agents known as angiogenesis inhibitors may offer important advantages with respect to the treatment of numerous types of malignancies. Currently, a number of clinical trials are under way to evaluate the clinical potential of several different angiogenesis inhibitors in several hematologic neoplasms.","['Gabrilove, J L']",['Gabrilove JL'],"['Division of Medical Oncology, Department of Medicine, The Derald H.

To get insights into this role, we have identified and studied the TFPT (FB1) promoter and its responsiveness to hematopoietic transcriptional factors. We found that the TFPT (FB1) 5' flanking sequence displays the features of a TATA-less promoter with weak homology to Inr (Initiator) elements. Starvation experiments suggested that TFPT (FB1) expression might be constitutive. Nevertheless, the TFPT (FB1) promoter, tested by transactivation assays, was found to be responsive to Ikaros 2 and, mainly, to PU.1, a transcription factor belonging to the Ets family.

During its continuous culture for a long term, a single marker chromosome with a homogeneously staining region (HSR) replaces the dmins. The both structures harbor amplified c-MYC sequences. Here we ask how the cellular phenotype is altered by the c-MYC integration into a HSR. Treatment with dimethyl sulfoxide induces granulocytic differentiation in the both types of cells. In contrast to HL-60/dmin cells, however, no apoptosis followed differentiation and the differentiation phenotype was reverted upon withdrawal of the drug in HL-60/HSR cells. Terminal differentiation and loss of DNase I hypersensitivity sites at c-MYC P2 promoter appeared to be unlinked in the both types of cells. By comparison with HL-60/dmin cells, we conclude that the integration into a HSR of an extrachromosomal gene(s) but not c-MYC likely leads to the loss of irreversibility of the differentiation phenotype.","['Kitajima, K', 'Haque, M', 'Nakamura, H', 'Hirano, T', 'Utiyama, H']","['Kitajima K', 'Haque M', 'Nakamura H', 'Hirano T', 'Utiyama H']","['Life Science Group, Faculty of Integrated Arts and Sciences, Hiroshima University, Higashi-Hiroshima, Hiroshima 739-8521, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Genetic Markers)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Nucleus/genetics/ultrastructure', 'Chromatin/chemistry', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/*pharmacology', 'Gene Amplification', '*Genes, myc', 'Genetic Markers', 'Granulocytes/*physiology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/biosynthesis/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis']",2001/11/09 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/11/09 10:00'],"['2001/11/09 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/09 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1006/bbrc.2001.5892 [doi]', 'S0006-291X(01)95892-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2001 Nov 16;288(5):1182-7. doi: 10.1006/bbrc.2001.5892.,['Copyright 2001 Academic Press.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To effect a cure with novel gene therapy approaches, these diseased cells must be eliminated either directly or indirectly using cytotoxic or suicide genes, or via activation of specific immune functional cells. Retroviral vectors are useful tools for long-term genome modification owing to their ability to integrate into host chromosomes. However, most oncoretroviruses, including murine leukemia virus (MLV), require cell division to facilitate nuclear entry; this has restricted the application of murine oncoretroviral vectors to cell targets that are actively dividing. Accordingly, gene transfer into hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and terminally differentiated cells such as muscles, neurons and dendritic cells (DCs) has been limited with the conventional oncoretroviral vectors. The lentiviral family of retroviruses, including human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), has been developed into useful gene transfer tools. Lentiviral vectors carry several nuclear entry viral proteins, and therefore can target slowly-dividing and non-dividing cells. To activate immune response against cancer or HIV infection, long-term marking of the target cells is not necessary. However, to establish intracellular defense to prevent HIV infection, prolonged genetic modification of target cells such as HSCs will be required. Due to the poor transduction efficiency and the problem of transgene silencing over time with oncoretroviral vectors, most gene therapy studies for AIDS and cancer using oncoretroviral vectors remain proof-of-concept studies. Here we will discuss recent developments in the use of retroviral vectors, including HIV-1-derived lentiviral vectors, for the treatment of AIDS and cancer, and their future therapeutic potential.","['Chang, L J', 'He, J']","['Chang LJ', 'He J']","['Department of Molecular Genetics and Microbiology, Powell Gene Therapy Center and McKnight Brain Institute, University of Florida, Gainesville 32610-0266, USA. lchang@mgm.ufl.edu']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Curr Opin Mol Ther,Current opinion in molecular therapeutics,100891485,,IM,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/*therapy', 'Dendritic Cells/transplantation', 'Genetic Therapy/adverse effects/*methods/trends', '*Genetic Vectors', 'HIV-1/genetics/physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Lentivirus/genetics', 'Neoplasms/*therapy', 'Retroviridae/*genetics/physiology', 'Safety', 'Virus Replication']",2001/11/09 10:00,2002/04/16 10:01,['2001/11/09 10:00'],"['2001/11/09 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/04/16 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/09 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Curr Opin Mol Ther. 2001 Oct;3(5):468-75.,,62,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In certain clinical circumstances, it can suggest a specific diagnosis, indicate a potentially treatable disease, and guide a clinician to an appropriate area for biopsy. A pattern of centrilobular ground-glass nodules is fairly specific for the diagnosis of hypersensitivity pneumonitis with the appropriate clinical history. The tree-in-bud pattern indicates disease affecting the small airways. The differential diagnosis is lengthy; however, the most common process leading to this CT appearance is infection. Although commonly associated with M. tuberculosis, many infectious organisms can produce this pattern. When honeycombing is seen on HRCT, a confident diagnosis of lung fibrosis can be made. The most common causes of interlobular septal thickening on HRCT are pulmonary edema, pulmonary hemorrhage, and lymphangitic spread of cancer, and smooth thickening is characteristic of all three. Diffuse lung cysts in patients who are not immunocompromised generally signify Langerhans' cell histiocytosis, lymphangioleiomyomatosis, or centrilobular emphysema. Centrilobular emphysema can be diagnosed when the centrilobular artery is seen as a small nodular opacity in the center of the cyst. Langerhans' cell histiocytosis is often associated with parenchymal nodules, helping to distinguish it from lymphangioleiomyomatosis. When a nodular pattern is seen on HRCT, the differential diagnosis is very long, but can be narrowed by noting whether the nodules are random, centrilobular, or perilymphatic in distribution. A mosaic pattern of lung attenuation can represent an infiltrative, small airway, or vascular process. The distinction can often be made by noting the size of the pulmonary vessels in the abnormal areas of lung, and whether air trapping is present on expiratory scanning. Computed tomographic signs can be useful indicators of a specific disease process. For instance, the air bronchogram sign indicates that an opacity is intrapulmonary in location, and signals the possibility of two types of neoplasm: lymphoma and bronchioloalveolar cell carcinoma. An air crescent sign indicates recovery of the immune system in an immunocompromised patient with invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. The fallen lung sign is diagnostic of a bronchial transection in the correct clinical setting. The gloved finger sign is very suggestive of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis. The halo sign is highly suggestive of early angioinvasive pulmonary aspergillosis in patients with acute leukemia. When a split pleura sign is seen, the diagnosis is often empyema, although other causes of pleuritis can lead to a similar CT appearance.","['Collins, J']",['Collins J'],"['Department of Radiology, Graduate Medicine Education, University of Wisconsin Medical School and Hospital and Clinics, Madison 53792-3252, USA. jcollin4@facstaff.wisc.edu']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Radiol Clin North Am,Radiologic clinics of North America,0123703,,IM,"['Diagnosis, Differential', 'Humans', 'Lung Diseases/*diagnostic imaging/pathology', 'Radiographic Image Enhancement', 'Radiography, Thoracic', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed']",2001/11/09 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/11/09 10:00'],"['2001/11/09 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/09 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0033-8389(05)70334-1 [pii]', '10.1016/s0033-8389(05)70334-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Radiol Clin North Am. 2001 Nov;39(6):1115-35. doi: 10.1016/s0033-8389(05)70334-1.,,27,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, we previously observed that, in serum-free conditions, polymorphonuclear leucocytes (PMNs) were killed rapidly by exposure to PMA, suggesting the possibility of serious side effects. In this study, we found that PMA-induced necrosis of PMNs was prevented by serum, suggesting the existence of a ""necrosis-suppressing factor"". Next we tried to identify the serum factor. The hemopexins we purified were found to suppress necrosis of PMNs in a dose-dependent fashion. Hemopexins alone could not suppress necrosis, however, as it required the coexistence of another macromolecule such as albumin. Albumin promoted the suppressive activity of hemopexins in a dose-dependent fashion. These results strongly suggest that serum hemopexins may rescue mature PMNs from necrosis in the PMA-administered leukemia patient as previously reported, resulting in avoidance of serious side effects.","['Suzuki, K', 'Kato, H', 'Sakuma, Y', 'Namiki, H']","['Suzuki K', 'Kato H', 'Sakuma Y', 'Namiki H']","['Department of Biology, School of Education, Waseda University, Tokyo, Japan. kingo@mn.waseda.ac.jp']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Japan,Cell Struct Funct,Cell structure and function,7608465,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Serum Albumin)', '11062-77-4 (Superoxides)', '9013-71-2 (Hemopexin)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Cattle', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Hemopexin/isolation & purification/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Necrosis', 'Neutrophils/cytology/*drug effects', 'Serum Albumin/pharmacology', 'Superoxides/metabolism', 'Swine', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Ultrafiltration']",2001/11/09 10:00,2002/04/26 10:01,['2001/11/09 10:00'],"['2001/11/09 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/04/26 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/09 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1247/csf.26.235 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Struct Funct. 2001 Aug;26(4):235-41. doi: 10.1247/csf.26.235.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Heterozygous germline mutations have been reported in Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS), a highly penetrant familial cancer phenotype, and in sporadic colon cancer. LFS is associated with the development of lymphoid malignancies, especially childhood ALL. Therefore, we analyzed the DNA from 143 lymphoid malignancies to determine whether they had mutations of the CHK2 gene. The 14 exons of CHK2 were studied by polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformational polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) and sequencing of aberrantly migrating bands. One missense mutation changing serine to phenylalanine (codon 428) in an evolutionarily highly conserved domain was found in a non-Hodgkin's aggressive lymphoma. Another point mutation in the non-coding region was identified in one of adult T-cell leukemias (ATL) samples. This result suggests that mutation of the CHK2 gene may rarely be involved in the development of selected lymphomas.","['Tavor, S', 'Takeuchi, S', 'Tsukasaki, K', 'Miller, C W', 'Hofmann, W K', 'Ikezoe, T', 'Said, J W', 'Koeffler, H P']","['Tavor S', 'Takeuchi S', 'Tsukasaki K', 'Miller CW', 'Hofmann WK', 'Ikezoe T', 'Said JW', 'Koeffler HP']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Cedars-Sinai Research Institute, UCLA School of Medicine, 8700 Beverly Blvd, D-5068, Los Angeles, CA 90048, USA. tavorsigal@yahoo.com']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Codon)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.1.11 (Checkpoint Kinase 2)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (CHEK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Cell Cycle/genetics', 'Checkpoint Kinase 2', 'Child', 'Codon', 'DNA Replication/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*genetics', 'Mutation', 'Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics', 'Protein Kinases/*genetics', '*Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid']",2001/11/09 10:00,2002/01/17 10:01,['2001/11/09 10:00'],"['2001/11/09 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/17 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/09 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428190109064610 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2001 Jul;42(3):517-20. doi: 10.3109/10428190109064610.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All but one exhibited a moderate number of somatic mutations, with percentages ranging from 4.1 to 9.5, and one of which indicated the effect of antigen selection on its VH gene. Multiple clone analysis of whole tissues showed intraclonal diversity in one case, whose VH gene carried a somatic mutation but the effect of antigen selection was not apparent. We further examined microdissected tissues to elucidate the relationship between FDC network and VH gene status in 2 cases. In one case, intraclonal diversity was not apparent irrespective of FDC network, however, both tumor cells around the FDC network and those apart from the FDC showed signs of intraclonal diversity in another case, suggesting that intraclonal diversity was not related to the FDC network in B-CLL. Here we demonstrate that some cases of B-CLL involved in lymph node carried mutated VH genes and showed intraclonal diversity like the tumor cells in the peripheral blood.

The oncoproteins were expressed with extreme variability, without significant differences among the various morphological or immunological AL subtypes. The mean percentages of bcl-2+ blasts were significantly higher in AML than in MDS (p = 0.01), and in MDS with bone marrow blastosis than in the forms without excess of blasts (p = 0.007). The lowest percentages of apoptotic cells were observed in ALL (mean 1%, p = 0.006), whereas in MDS the apoptotic index was higher (16.7%) than in AML (8.6%) and than in the normal controls (10.8%). but the difference tended to be statistically significant only for cases of refractory anaemia. Whereas in AML and MDS the apoptotic rate was independent of the oncoprotein expression, in ALL there was a significant linear relationship between TUNEL and ras positivity (p = 0.01). Among AML patients treated with intensive polychemotherapy, no differences were observed in oncoprotein expression and apoptotic rate between responders and resistant cases. In conclusion, our data are in agreement with the hypothesis that decreased apoptosis and enhanced cell survival are associated with AL, whereas a high level of apoptosis may be responsible for the ineffective hematopoiesis in MDS; abnormal expression of oncoproteins, even if not strictly related to apoptosis level, may influence disease behaviour.","['Invernizzi, R', 'Pecci, A', 'Bellotti, L', 'Ascari, E']","['Invernizzi R', 'Pecci A', 'Bellotti L', 'Ascari E']","['Universita di Pavia, IRCCS Policlinico S.

As the first step to clarify this, we examined the expression of Notch1 and Jagged1 proteins in eight AML cell lines and 15 fresh AML samples by immunoblotting. In the Notch1 protein, two bands, a 300 kDa band and a 120 kDa band, which appeared to be a full-length protein and a transmembrane fragment, respectively, were recognized in five AML cell lines and six fresh samples. In addition, three of the five cell lines showed a 110 kDa fragment, which appeared to be from an intracellular domain, namely an active form. One cell line showed aberrant sized fragments, which suggested a structural abnormality. Jagged1 protein was recognized in six cell lines and six fresh samples. In four cell lines and four fresh samples, both Notch1 and Jagged1 proteins were observed. In these cells, Notch1 and Jagged1 proteins may interact among themselves.

Forty-eight hours after transfection, BAD increased cell death in COS, COS Bcl-2, and COS Bcl-xL cells as demonstrated by decreased GFP expression, and an increase in the number of number of floating cells. In addition, BAD induced cell death in leukemic cell lines over-expressing Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL as determined by changes in luciferase activity.

The prognostic implications of CD45 expression were studied in non-high-risk (low-risk + intermediate-risk) (n = 60) and high-risk patients (n = 52) with B-precursor ALL who had been treated with the risk-directed protocol of ALL-941 trial. Although CD45 expression did not correlate with the event-free survival (EFS) of the non-high-risk patients, there was a significant correlation between the expression levels and the EFS of the high-risk patients: the 3-year EFS rate of the CD45low group (n = 26, RALV = 0.017-0.132) was 88 +/- 7% versus the CD45high group (n = 26, RALV = 0.133-0.450) at 34 +/- 24% (p < 0.05). These results show that the levels of expression of the CD45 antigen on leukemic lymphoblasts are significantly correlated with the clinical features and prognosis of childhood ALL.","['Nakamura, A', 'Tsurusawa, M', 'Kato, A', 'Taga, T', 'Hatae, Y', 'Miyake, M', 'Mimaya, J', 'Onodera, N', 'Watanabe, A', 'Watanabe, T', 'Kanegane, H', 'Matsushita, T', 'Iwai, A', 'Hyakuna, N', 'Gushi, K', 'Kawakami, T', 'Sekine, I', 'Izichi, O', 'Asami, K', 'Kikuta, A', 'Tanaka, A', 'Fujimoto, T']","['Nakamura A', 'Tsurusawa M', 'Kato A', 'Taga T', 'Hatae Y', 'Miyake M', 'Mimaya J', 'Onodera N', 'Watanabe A', 'Watanabe T', 'Kanegane H', 'Matsushita T', 'Iwai A', 'Hyakuna N', 'Gushi K', 'Kawakami T', 'Sekine I', 'Izichi O', 'Asami K', 'Kikuta A', 'Tanaka A', 'Fujimoto T']","['Department of Pediatrics, Aichi Medical University, Aichi, 480-1195 Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '9PHQ9Y1OLM (Prednisolone)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/*analysis', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/administration & dosage', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Child', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens/*analysis', 'Mercaptopurine/administration & dosage', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*immunology', 'Prednisolone/administration & dosage', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Time Factors', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",2001/11/09 10:00,2002/01/17 10:01,['2001/11/09 10:00'],"['2001/11/09 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/17 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/09 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428190109064596 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2001 Jul;42(3):393-8. doi: 10.3109/10428190109064596.,,,,,,,,,,"[""Children's Cancer and Leukemia Study Group""]",,,,,,,,,,

Administration of liposomal ATRA (lipoATRA) circumvents, for perhaps several months, the decrease in ATRA levels and produces CRs in patients with relapsed APL. These findings led us to administer lipoATRA ""monotherapy"" to patients with newly-diagnosed APL. Patients received lipoATRA (90 mg/m2) for induction and continued to receive the drug, by itself, for 9 months unless 2 PCR tests done within 2-4 weeks of each other at a sensitivity level of 10(-4) were positive at 3 or 6 months from CR date, in which case idarubicin was added to lipoATRA. If the PCR test was negative 9 months from CR date, treatment stopped. 34 patients were enrolled, of whom 79% entered CR. The PCR test at time of CR was positive in 23/24 patients, but was negative in 24/26 (92%) 3 months later. Of most interest 11 of the 26 evaluable responding patients have remained PCR negative (tested Q 3 months) with a median follow-up of 18 months (range up to 34 months). It is generally believed that this type of result would be unlikely with oral ATRA monotherapy. Recurrence of morphologic APL has occurred in 4 patients, at 5, 6, 12, and 12 months, with a median follow-up time of 18 months in the patients remaining alive in CR. Comparison of this lipoATRA +/- idarubicin trial with oral ATRA + idarubicin induction and idarubicin + POMP maintenance, our previous trial, indicates similar survival, CR, and DFS in CR rates, with a suggestion that lipoATRA may produce lower CR rates and hence shorter survival in patients with high-risk disease (wbc count > 10,000/microliter. Nonetheless, the rates and duration of PCR negativity produced by lipoATRA monotherapy suggest that lipoATRA is a superior anti-APL agent than oral ATRA.","['Estey, E', 'Koller, C', 'Cortes, J', 'Reed, P', 'Freireich, E', 'Giles, F', 'Kantarjian, H']","['Estey E', 'Koller C', 'Cortes J', 'Reed P', 'Freireich E', 'Giles F', 'Kantarjian H']","['Department of Leukemia, University of Texas, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA. eestey@notes.mdacc.tmc.edu']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Drug Carriers)', '0 (Liposomes)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Drug Carriers', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Liposomes', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Rate', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tretinoin/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use']",2001/11/09 10:00,2002/01/17 10:01,['2001/11/09 10:00'],"['2001/11/09 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/17 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/09 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428190109064587 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2001 Jul;42(3):309-16. doi: 10.3109/10428190109064587.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the impact of cytogenetic abnormalities is considerable for prognosis, the exact genetic mechanism of MDS remains undetermined. In this study we assessed cytogenetic changes, microsatellite alterations, and telomere dynamics in order to obtain further insight into the pathogenesis of MDS. Thirty-three percentage of MDS patients and 60% of post-MDS acute leukemia (post-MDS AML) had de novo microsatellite changes. In the MDS phase, however, > 60% of patients showed reduction of telomere lengths without microsatellite changes, indicating that telomere reduction in most MDS patients does not seem to be directly linked to genome instability, or that reduction of telomere length does not induce microsatellite changes in the MDS phase. Some MDS patients had microsatellite changes without telomerase elevation, indicating that genome instability might accumulate during the disease progression in some MDS patients, and this condition (cellular senescence) may be related to ineffective hemopoiesis in MDS patients. In contrast, 40% of post-MDS AML patients had elevated telomerase activity with microsatellite changes, indicating that approximately 40% of patients with post-MDS AML patients had accumulation of genome instability resulting in elevated telomerase activity in an attempt to obtain genetic stability. However, the remaining MDS patients had microsatellite changes without telomerase up-regulation, suggesting that some MDS had genome instability even after leukemic transformation. Most MDS patients with elevated telomerase activity in the AML phase had elevated telomerase activity even in the MDS phase without apparent change in telomere length before and after leukemic transformation. These findings indicate that telomerase activity in the MDS phase may be independent of telomere length, although telomere shortening seems to be related to genomic instability, and this process may be linked to apoptosis of MDS cells.","['Ohyashiki, K', 'Iwama, H', 'Yahata, N', 'Tauchi, T', 'Kawakubo, K', 'Shimamoto, T', 'Ohyashiki, J H']","['Ohyashiki K', 'Iwama H', 'Yahata N', 'Tauchi T', 'Kawakubo K', 'Shimamoto T', 'Ohyashiki JH']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Tokyo Medical University, Department of Virology, Medical Research Institute, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo 160-0023, Japan. ohyashik@rr.iij4u.or.jp']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,IM,"['Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Disease Progression', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics', 'Telomere/*genetics']",2001/11/09 10:00,2002/01/17 10:01,['2001/11/09 10:00'],"['2001/11/09 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/17 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/09 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428190109064585 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2001 Jul;42(3):291-9. doi: 10.3109/10428190109064585.,,32,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These findings strongly suggest that WT1 is a potential target of immunotherapy for human leukemia. We have established a CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) clone, designated TAK-1, which is specific for a WT1-derived 9-mer peptide consisting of HLA-A24-binding anchor motifs. TAK-1 lysed both HLA-A24-positive allogeneic cells and autologous cells that were loaded with a WT1-derived peptide. TAK-1 was cytotoxic to HLA-A24-positive leukemia cells, but not to HLA-A24-positive lymphoma cells that did not express WT1, to HLA-A24-negative leukemia cells, or to HLA-A24-positive normal cells. Treating leukemia cells with an antisense oligonucleotide complementary to WT1 reduced TAK-1-mediated cytotoxicity. TAK-1 did not inhibit colony formation of HLA-A24-positive normal bone marrow cells. Recently, other groups have also reported the establishment of HLA-A2-restricted anti-leukemic CTLs specific for WT1-derived peptide. In addition, a murine model of immunotherapy against WT1-expressing tumors has been reported. Recent studies have demonstrated that WT1 is also aberrantly expressed in various kinds of cancer cells.

Thirty-two patients were evaluable for efficacy and 26 (81%) responded. 88% of patients with aggressive NHL responded; three (18%) patients achieved complete remission (CR), 12 (70%) achieved partial remission (PR), 1 (6%) patient had stable disease (SD) and 1 (6%) patient progressed through treatment.

Twenty-three patients developed an infection at some stage during therapy (all associated with neutropenia) and required hospitalisation.

Platelet toxicity was mild in patients with normal platelet counts at the commencement of therapy. Alopecia and mucositis were mild. No clinical evidence of myocardial failure was observed. We conclude that the substitution of DaunoXome for doxorubicin in the CHOP regimen to form COP-X provides excellent efficacy against non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Response durations were short but comparable to those reported with other regimens. COP-X was well tolerated with some suggestion of reduced non-haematological toxicity.

Although VEGF and b FGF have been suggested to be reliable prognostic indicators and important tools for treatment approach in malignant haematopoietic and solid tumours, experience in childhood ALL has been limited to only one study on angiogenesis and urine b FGF. All 31 ALL patients included in the present study at the time of diagnosis and in remission, and all 10 control children had detectable serum levels of VEGF and b FGF. The median level of s-VEGF at the time of diagnosis was significantly lower than in the control group and at the time of remission (respectively p = 0.005, p = 0.0001). Twenty six of 31 patients had an increasing trend of s-VEGF levels in remission reaching control values compared with the levels obtained at diagnosis. S-b FGF median levels at the time of diagnosis were the same as those of the control group, significantly lower than the median s-b FGF values in remission (p = 0.001). In patients with lower platelet counts (< 50 x 10(9)/L) growth factors (VEGF and b FGF) were lower than in patients with higher platelet counts (p = 0.0009 and p = 0.002 respectively). In patients with hepatosplenomegaly (longitudinal size > 3 cm) b FGF levels were higher than patients without hepatosplenomegaly (P = 0.003). We concluded that the increment in both s-VEGF and s-b FGF in patients in remission may be related to the renewal of normal haematopoiesis. The increase in s-VEGF values in 26 out of 31 patients in remission compared to normal control values, may also suggest that there is clinical significance in ALL patients.","['Yetgin, S', 'Yenicesu, I', 'Cetin, M', 'Tuncer, M']","['Yetgin S', 'Yenicesu I', 'Cetin M', 'Tuncer M']","[""Department of Pediatric Haematology, Ihsan Dogramaci Children's Hospital, Hacettepe University, 06100, Ankara, Turkey. m-tuncer@bi.net.tr""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Endothelial Growth Factors)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors)', '103107-01-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 2)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Endothelial Growth Factors/*blood', 'Female', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 2/*blood', 'Hepatomegaly/blood', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Lymphokines/*blood', 'Male', 'Platelet Count', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*blood/complications/diagnosis', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Splenomegaly/blood', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors']",2001/11/09 10:00,2002/05/17 10:01,['2001/11/09 10:00'],"['2001/11/09 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/05/17 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/09 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428190109097679 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2001 Jun;42(1-2):83-8. doi: 10.3109/10428190109097679.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, reports of the frequency of My+ ALL in children vary widely across laboratories using different mAb clones and staining and analysing procedures. Taking two commonly accepted thresholds of positivity for myeloid antigens (20 and 30%), we analysed the immunoreactivity of the most widely employed mAb clones against CD13 (SJ1D1, L138 and My7) and CD33 (My9, P67.6 and D3HL60) and compared the proportions of My+ ALL detected by these clones in childhood ALL. The correlation between myeloid antigen expression and the presence of the t(12;21) translocation was analysed concomitantly in the same samples. The percentage of ALL cases positive for myeloid markers varied significantly depending on the mAb clone and the positive threshold. Among patients with B-ALL, the proportion of CD13+ ALL was significantly lower using SJ1D1 than using L138 or My7, while the proportion of CD33+ ALL was significantly higher for My9 than for P67.6 or D3HL60. Analysis of the co-expression of CD13 and CD33 on B-ALL cells using combinations of mAb clones showed that this frequency was either underestimated by the SJ1D1/D3HL60 or overestimated by the L138/P67.6 and My7/My9 combinations. A correlation between CD13/CD33 positivity and the t(12;21) translocation was uniformly observed in B-ALL patients for a positive threshold of 30%, whereas SJ1D1/D3HL60 detected no correlation between t(12;21) and CD13/CD33 positivity when the threshold was lowered to 20%. These data show that the mAb clones commonly used to detect the CD13 and CD33 surface antigens have variable immunoreactivity against childhood ALL cells, which may partly explain the conflicting reports concerning the prognostic significance of myeloid antigen expression in paediatric ALL and its association with different translocations. The present findings may also be of clinical importance for therapeutic choices.","['Firat, H', 'Favier, R', 'Adam, M', 'Leverger, G', 'Landman-Parker, J', 'Cayre, Y', 'Douay, L']","['Firat H', 'Favier R', 'Adam M', 'Leverger G', 'Landman-Parker J', 'Cayre Y', 'Douay L']","[""Service d'Hematologie Biologique, Hopital d'enfants Armand Trousseau, 26 Avenue du Docteur Arnold Netter, 75571 Paris, France.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (CD33 protein, human)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3)', '0 (TEL-AML1 fusion protein)', 'EC 3.4.11.2 (CD13 Antigens)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, CD/analysis/immunology', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/analysis/immunology', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*analysis/immunology', 'CD13 Antigens/analysis/immunology', 'Child', 'Clone Cells/immunology/pathology', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'Humans', 'Myeloid Cells/*immunology/pathology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*immunology/pathology', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3']",2001/11/09 10:00,2002/05/17 10:01,['2001/11/09 10:00'],"['2001/11/09 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/05/17 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/09 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428190109097678 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2001 Jun;42(1-2):75-82. doi: 10.3109/10428190109097678.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Between 1992 and 1999 we saw 146 patients with newly-diagnosed AML (APL excluded) and an initial WBC count > 50 x 10(9)/L of whom 71 underwent leukapheresis at the discretion of their treating doctors. We compared outcome (early mortality, CR, and overall survival) rates in the patients who were and were not pheresed. After accounting for covariates relevant to these outcomes, including age, performance status, and cytogenetics, there was evidence (p = .006) that pheresis reduced 2-week mortality rate and a suggestion (p = .06) that this resulted in a higher CR rate. However there was no evidence that pheresis lengthened longer-term or overall survival; if anything the suggestion was the converse (p = .06). These data may reflect the fact that the patients chosen to have pheresis were prognostically unfavorable as defined by variables that were not captured in our data set, since the alternative explanation i.e. that pheresis per se shortens overall survival seems less likely. Whether the above justifies the use of pheresis in the absence of evidence from a randomized trial is doubtful, but it seems likely that any long-term benefit to be derived from this procedure must await further advances in anti-leukemia therapy.","['Giles, F J', 'Shen, Y', 'Kantarjian, H M', 'Korbling, M J', ""O'Brien, S"", 'Anderlini, P', 'Donato, M', 'Pierce, S', 'Keating, M J', 'Freireich, E J', 'Estey, E']","['Giles FJ', 'Shen Y', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Korbling MJ', ""O'Brien S"", 'Anderlini P', 'Donato M', 'Pierce S', 'Keating MJ', 'Freireich EJ', 'Estey E']","['Departments of Leukemia, Biostatistics, and Blood and Marrow Transplantation, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Boulevard, Box 61, Houston, TX 77030, USA. fgiles@mdanderson.org']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Humans', '*Leukapheresis', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/blood/mortality/*therapy', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Middle Aged', 'Regression Analysis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome']",2001/11/09 10:00,2002/05/17 10:01,['2001/11/09 10:00'],"['2001/11/09 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/05/17 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/09 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428190109097677 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2001 Jun;42(1-2):67-73. doi: 10.3109/10428190109097677.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to investigate the impact of this situation on the overall outcome of patients we conducted a retrospective analysis of 130 patients, resistant to a single induction course from among three consecutive protocols, using the same induction regimen employed by the BGMT study group. This group of patients has a particularly poor prognosis with relapse and survival rates of 70% and 14% respectively at 5 years. For these patients, being in CR after two induction courses appears to be a major prognostic factor for outcome, since the 5-year Kaplan-Meier survival probability is significantly better (29%, range 17-46) than of those patients with resistant disease (5%, range 2-13). However, results are worse than when complete remission is obtained after a single course. Thus, post remission treatment should have a powerful anti-leukemic effect in preventing relapse. Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation is a preferential strategy in this setting but to be effective this should be performed as early as possible. Furthermore, these results indicate that allogeneic bone marrow transplantation from an alternative donor should be considered in the absence of HLA identical sibling.","['Jourdan, E', 'Reiffers, J', 'Stoppa, A M', 'Sotto, J J', 'Attal, M', 'Bouabdallaha, R', 'Marit, G', 'Fegueux, N', 'Boulat, O', 'Dastugue, N', 'Boiron, J M', 'Faberes, C', 'Gastaut, J A', 'Maraninchi, D', 'Blaise, D']","['Jourdan E', 'Reiffers J', 'Stoppa AM', 'Sotto JJ', 'Attal M', 'Bouabdallaha R', 'Marit G', 'Fegueux N', 'Boulat O', 'Dastugue N', 'Boiron JM', 'Faberes C', 'Gastaut JA', 'Maraninchi D', 'Blaise D']","['Hopital Caremeau, CHU Nimes, France.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/mortality', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/mortality/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Transplantation, Homologous/mortality', 'Treatment Outcome']",2001/11/09 10:00,2002/05/17 10:01,['2001/11/09 10:00'],"['2001/11/09 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/05/17 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/09 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428190109097676 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2001 Jun;42(1-2):57-65. doi: 10.3109/10428190109097676.,,,,,,,,,,['BGMT Study Group'],,,,,,,,,,

In order to quantify cytological features and to assess objective descriptions, a morphometric analysis was performed on 83 peripheral blood smears of B-cells disorders (n = 77) and healthy donors (n = 6). Using standardized May-Grunwald Giemsa staining, standardized image acquisition system and well defined microscopic fields, we have analyzed lymphoid cells, measuring morphometric and color parameters. By combining seven relevant morphometric criteria (the nuclear shape, the cellular shape and area, the nucleo-cytoplasmic ratio, the nuclear red/blue ratio, the cytoplasmic green/blue ratio and the proportion of cells with nucleolus), we have established a score that could range from a minimum of -3 (large B-CLL type) to a maximum of +8 (large MCL type): negative scores corresponds to different types of B-CLL (n = 30), including ""atypical B-CLL"" (n = 6), the score zero correspond to healthy donors (n = 6) used as baseline, the positive score values correspond to +1 for Follicular lymphoma (n = 2), +3 for Splenic Lymphoma with Villous Lymphocytes (n = 12), +4 for Hairy Cell Leukemia (n = 7), for Hairy Cell Leukemia-variant (n = 2), +6 for B-prolymphocytic leukemia (n = 6) and +7 and +8 for most Mantle Cell Lymphoma (n = 18). Testing T-cell disorders samples (n = 10) using the same protocol, the profile is different and cannot be confused with B-cell diseases.

The expression level of IL-11R alpha in B-CLL cells is much higher than in PBL of normal donors. Recombinant human IL-11 (rhIL-11) activates B-CLL cells, leading to morphologic alterations of the cells and increase in cell number and size. Short-term cultivation in the presence of rhIL-11 did not lead to quantitative changes in the ratio of the living vs apoptotic and dead cells. However, in contrast to rhIL-6, pretreatment with rhIL-11, did not cause B-CLL cells to be resistant to the action of dexamethasone.

In a 5 year period a consecutive series of 152 presentation ALL's were karyotyped. In all cases a result was obtained and 138 (91%) had a detectable abnormal clone of which 44 (29%) were high-hyperdiploid. Within the high-hyperdiploidy group karyotypic cell to cell variation was observed in many cases. To provide further evidence of this phenomenon a dual-color fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) experiment was performed on stored fixed suspension from 14 ALL's with such a karyotype. In each case 4-6 probes were investigated, employing probes to centromeres of chromosomes X, 4, 6, 8, and 10 and a locus specific probe to chromosome 21q22. It was found that the FISH produced results that were generally in good agreement with the G-banding findings and supported the notion of karyotypic cell to cell variation. FISH further showed that most of cases would have two extra copies of chromosome 21 in the majority of leukemic cells and a single extra copy in the minority. A further finding was that fewer cells contained extra copies of chromosomes 6, 8 and 10 than was expected based on the comparison of the signal number of the other probes investigated. In contrast chromosomes X, 4, and 21 seldom displayed this feature. We have demonstrated that karyotypic instability as defined by karyotypic cell to cell variation is a feature of the high-hyperdiploid subgroup in childhood ALL. It is questioned whether the underlying defect resulting in the observed karyotypic instability of this subgroup is one of the primary causative events in the formation of the leukemia.","['Betts, D R', 'Riesch, M', 'Grotzer, M A', 'Niggli, F K']","['Betts DR', 'Riesch M', 'Grotzer MA', 'Niggli FK']","[""Department of Oncology, University Children's Hospital, Steinwiesstrasse 75, CH-8032 Zurich, Switzerland.

However, B-CLL associated autoimmunity is typically restricted to self-antigens expressed by blood cells, and mediated by IgG autoantibodies of polyclonal origin. In the present study, we addressed the question whether self-reactive antibody repertoires of plasma IgM and IgG are disturbed by monoclonal immunoglobulins of B-CLL patients, and whether antibody repertoires of patients exhibiting B-CLL associated target-restricted autoimmune disease (AID) differ from those of B-CLL patients without AID. We investigated antibody repertoires at a global level, using a technique of quantitative immunoblotting that allows for the quantitative screening of antibody reactivities in complex antibody mixtures toward a large panel of antigens derived from homologous tissue extracts, followed by multiparametric statistical analysis of the data. We demonstrate that self-reactive antibody repertoires of plasma IgM and IgG are broadly altered in patients with B-CLL, that alterations in self-reactive antibody repertoires are not restricted to B-CLL patients exhibiting AID, and that target-restricted autoimmunity in B-CLL patients is associated with altered antibody repertoires not restricted to the target organ. We conclude that monoclonal alterations of immunoglobulin production in B-CLL are associated with broad defects of self-reactive antibody repertoires. Our observations suggest that the application of therapeutic IVIg preparations might influence B-CLL by restoring normal self-reactive antibody repertoires in plasma.","['Stahl, D', 'Lacroix-Desmazes, S', 'Sibrowski, W', 'Kazatchkine, M D', 'Kaveri, S V']","['Stahl D', 'Lacroix-Desmazes S', 'Sibrowski W', 'Kazatchkine MD', 'Kaveri SV']","['INSERM U430, Universite Pierre et Marie Curie, Hopital Broussais, Paris, France. stahld@uni-muenster.de']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Autoantibodies)', '0 (Autoantigens)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Autoantibodies/blood/classification', 'Autoantigens/immunology', 'Autoimmune Diseases/etiology/immunology', 'Autoimmunity/*immunology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Immunoglobulin G/blood/*immunology', 'Immunoglobulin M/blood/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/complications/*immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",2001/11/09 10:00,2002/05/17 10:01,['2001/11/09 10:00'],"['2001/11/09 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/05/17 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/09 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428190109097688 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2001 Jun;42(1-2):163-76. doi: 10.3109/10428190109097688.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Samples were tested for HTLV antibodies and infection was confirmed as HTLV-I by Western Blot and/or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays. Overall 26/37 (70%) of mothers, 24/37 (65%) of wives, 8/22 (36%) of husbands, 34/112 (30%) of siblings and 10/82 (12%) offspring were HTLV-I infected. In 11 ATL patients, mothers were repeatedly HTLV-I seronegative, but HTLV-I pol or tax sequences were detected in 2 out of 6 cases tested by PCR. ATL patients with seronegative mothers related the following risk factors for HTLV-I infection: 6 were breast-fed by surrogate mothers with unknown HTLV-I status, 4 had a sexually promiscuous behaviour and 1 had multiple blood transfusions at a young age. Familial aggregation of ATL and other HTLV-I associated diseases such as HTLV-I myelopathy (HAM/TSP) and or uveitis, ATL in sibling pairs or in multiple generations was seen in 9 families. There were 6 families with ATL and TSP sibling pairs. In 3 families at least one parent had died with lymphoma or presenting neurological diseases and 2 offspring with ATL. Further to the extent of vertical and horizontal transmission of HTLV-I infection within ATL families, our results demonstrate that mothers who provide surrogate breast-milk appear to be an important source of HTLV-I transmission and ATL development in Brazil.","['Pombo-de-Oliveira, M S', 'Carvalho, S M', 'Borducchi, D', 'Dobbin, J', 'Salvador, J', 'Correa, R B', 'Moellman, A', 'Loureiro, P', 'Chiattone, C', 'Rios, M']","['Pombo-de-Oliveira MS', 'Carvalho SM', 'Borducchi D', 'Dobbin J', 'Salvador J', 'Correa RB', 'Moellman A', 'Loureiro P', 'Chiattone C', 'Rios M']","['Cell Marker Laboratory-Department of Hematology of Instituto Nacional de Cancer, Hematologia Clinica, Praca Cruz Vermelha, 23, 7th floor, CEP 20 230 030-Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. mpombo@inca.org.br']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,IM,"['Brazil/epidemiology', 'Breast Feeding/adverse effects', 'Disease Transmission, Infectious/statistics & numerical data', 'Family Health', 'Female', 'HTLV-I Infections/diagnosis/epidemiology/*transmission', 'Humans', 'Infectious Disease Transmission, Vertical/statistics & numerical data', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell', 'Male', 'Nuclear Family', 'Paraparesis, Tropical Spastic', 'Pedigree']",2001/11/09 10:00,2002/05/17 10:01,['2001/11/09 10:00'],"['2001/11/09 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/05/17 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/09 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428190109097685 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2001 Jun;42(1-2):135-44. doi: 10.3109/10428190109097685.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its prognostic importance in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) is currently under investigation in view of the fact that two different groups have recently indicated that CD38 expression could be an independent prognostic marker in B-CLL. We analyzed the clinico-biological features of 61 immunologically typical (CD5+CD23+) B-CLL patients stratified according to the CD38 expression. Twenty-two (36%) patients expressed CD38 in more than 30% of CD19-positive cells and were considered as CD38-positive B-CLL. Atypical morphology (p 0.02), peripheral blood lymphocytosis (p 0.01) and diffuse histopathologic bone marrow pattern (p 0.003) were findings found to be closely associated with CD38 expression. On the other hand, A and B Binet stages (p 0.02) and interstitial bone marrow involvement (p 0.005) were more represented in the CD38-negative B-CLL group. Trisomy 12 was detected more frequently in the CD38-positive B-CLL group, while 13q14 deletions mainly occurred in CD38-negative group (p 0.005). Finally, median survival of CD38-positive B-CLL patients was 90 months, while it was not reached at 180 months in CD38-negative patients. Taken together, our data strongly suggest that the evaluation of CD38 expression may identify two groups patients with B-CLL greatly differing in their clinico-biological features.","[""D'Arena, G"", 'Musto, P', 'Cascavilla, N', ""Dell'Olio, M"", 'Di Renzo, N', 'Perla, G', 'Savino, L', 'Carotenuto, M']","[""D'Arena G"", 'Musto P', 'Cascavilla N', ""Dell'Olio M"", 'Di Renzo N', 'Perla G', 'Savino L', 'Carotenuto M']","['Division of Hematology, IRCCS Casa Sollievo della Sofferenza Hospital, 71013 San Giovanni Rotondo, Italy. ematologia@operapadrepio.it']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (CD38 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (NAD+ Nucleosidase)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase', 'ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1', 'Adult', 'Aged', '*Antigens, CD', 'Antigens, Differentiation/*biosynthesis', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*biosynthesis', 'Biomarkers/analysis', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/*immunology/mortality', 'Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Middle Aged', 'NAD+ Nucleosidase/*biosynthesis', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",2001/11/09 10:00,2002/05/17 10:01,['2001/11/09 10:00'],"['2001/11/09 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/05/17 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/09 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428190109097682 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2001 Jun;42(1-2):109-14. doi: 10.3109/10428190109097682.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This phenomenon also confers cross-tolerance to other stimuli including tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha and interleukin (IL)-1beta. Post-receptor convergence of signal transduction pathways might occur after LPS, IL-1beta, and TNF-alpha stimulation. Therefore, it was hypothesized that down-regulation of common signaling molecules induces cross-tolerance among these stimuli. LPS tolerance and cross-tolerance were examined in THP-1 cells. Phosphorylation of MAP kinases and degradation of inhibitor kappaBalpha (IkappaBalpha) DNA binding of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), and mediator production were examined. In naive cells, LPS, TNF-alpha, and IL-1beta induced IkappaBalpha degradation, kinase phosphorylation, and NF-kappaB DNA binding. LPS stimulation induced production of TNF-alpha or TxB2 and degradation of IRAK. However, neither TNF-alpha nor IL-1beta induced IRAK degradation or stimulated TNF-alpha or TxB2 production in naive cells. Pretreatment with each stimulus induced homologous tolerance to restimulation with the same agonist. LPS tolerance also suppressed LPS-induced TxB2 and TNF-alpha production. LPS pretreatment induced cross-tolerance to TNF-alpha or IL-1beta stimulation. Pretreatment with TNF-alpha induced cross-tolerance to LPS-induced signaling events and TxB2 production. Although pretreatment with IL-1beta did not induce cross-tolerance to LPS-induced signaling events, it strongly inhibited LPS TNF-alpha and TxB2 production. These data demonstrate that IL-1beta induces cross-tolerance to LPS-induced mediator production without suppressing LPS-induced signaling to MAP kinases or NF-kappaB activation.","['Ferlito, M', 'Romanenko, O G', 'Ashton, S', 'Squadrito, F', 'Halushka, P V', 'Cook, J A']","['Ferlito M', 'Romanenko OG', 'Ashton S', 'Squadrito F', 'Halushka PV', 'Cook JA']","['Department of Physiology and Neuroscience, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, USA.']",['eng'],['GM27673/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,"['0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Endotoxins)', '0 (I-kappa B Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '139874-52-5 (NF-KappaB Inhibitor alpha)', '54397-85-2 (Thromboxane B2)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Interleukin-1 Receptor-Associated Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Culture Media, Conditioned', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Tolerance', 'Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay', 'Endotoxins/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', '*I-kappa B Proteins', 'Interleukin-1/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-1 Receptor-Associated Kinases', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/pathology', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/*drug effects', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Monocytes/drug effects/metabolism', 'NF-KappaB Inhibitor alpha', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational/drug effects', 'Thromboxane B2/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/biosynthesis/genetics/*pharmacology']",2001/11/08 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/11/08 10:00'],"['2001/11/08 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/08 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 2001 Nov;70(5):821-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There are wide discrepancies in the literature regarding the expression of the Bcl-2 family of proteins in human neutrophils.

However, no Bcl-X(L) protein was detected in Western blots. Protein levels for the proapoptotic proteins Bad, Bax, Bak, and Bik remained constant during culture, despite changes in the levels of mRNA for these gene products. These proapoptotic proteins were extremely stable, having very long half-lives. In contrast, A1 and Mcl-1 transcripts were extremely unstable (with approximately 3-h half-lives), and Mcl-1 protein was also subject to rapid turnover. These results indicate that neutrophil survival is regulated by the inducible expression of the short-lived Mcl-1 and possibly the A1 gene products. In the absence of their continued expression, these prosurvival gene products are rapidly turned over, and then the activity of the stable death proteins predominates and promotes apoptosis.","['Moulding, D A', 'Akgul, C', 'Derouet, M', 'White, M R', 'Edwards, S W']","['Moulding DA', 'Akgul C', 'Derouet M', 'White MR', 'Edwards SW']","['The University of Liverpool, School of Biological Sciences, Life Sciences Building, Crown Street, Liverpool L69 7ZB, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BAD protein, human)', '0 (BAK1 protein, human)', '0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (BIK protein, human)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Mitochondrial Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nucleic Acid Synthesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Protein Synthesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (bcl-Associated Death Protein)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)', '67-99-2 (Gliotoxin)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'EC 3.6.4.- (Replication Protein C)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/*genetics', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'Carrier Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Dactinomycin/pharmacology', 'Eosinophils/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Genes, bcl-2', 'Gliotoxin/pharmacology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Half-Life', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/pharmacology', 'Lipopolysaccharides/pharmacology', 'Membrane Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Mitochondrial Proteins', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'NF-kappa B/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Neutrophils/cytology/*metabolism', 'Nucleic Acid Synthesis Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Protein Synthesis Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Proteins/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Replication Protein C', 'Time Factors', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology', 'bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein', 'bcl-Associated Death Protein', 'bcl-X Protein']",2001/11/08 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/11/08 10:00'],"['2001/11/08 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/08 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 2001 Nov;70(5):783-92.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have investigated whether primary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells have an effect on normal T cell function and signaling. Tumor cell supernatant (TSN) from AML cells inhibited T cell activation and Th1 cytokine production and also prevented activated T cells from entering the cell cycle. These effects occurred in the absence of AML cell-T cell contact. We have demonstrated that AML TSN contained none of the immunosuppressors described to date, namely gangliosides, nitric oxide, TGF-beta, IL-10, vascular endothelial growth factor, or PGs. Furthermore, IL-2 did not overcome the block, despite normal IL-2R expression. However, the effect was overcome by preincubation with inhibitors of protein secretion and abolished by trypsinization, indicating that the active substance includes one or more proteins. To determine the mechanism of inhibition, we have studied many of the major pathways involved in T cell activation and proliferation. We show that nuclear translocation of NFATc and NF-kappaB are markedly reduced in T cells activated in the presence of primary AML cells. In contrast, calcium mobilization and activation of other signal transduction pathways, namely extracellular signal-regulated kinase1/2, p38, and STAT5 were unaffected, but activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1/2 was delayed. Phosphorylation of pRb by cyclin-dependent kinase 6/4-cyclin D and of p130 did not occur and c-Myc, cyclin D3, and p107 were not induced, consistent with cell cycle inhibition early during the transition from G(0) to G(1).

Treatment of HL60 cells with apicidin caused a decrease in viable cell number in a dose-dependent manner and an increase in DNA fragmentation, nuclear morphological change, and apoptotic body formation, concomitant with progressive accumulation of hyperacetylated histone H4. In addition, apicidin converted the procaspase-3 form to catalytically active effector protease, resulting in subsequent cleavages of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase and p21(WAF1/Cip1).

Moreover, these effects were preceded by an increase in translocation of Bax into the mitochondria, resulting in the release of cytochrome c and cleavage of procaspase-9. The addition of cycloheximide greatly inhibited activation of caspase-3 by apicidin by interfering with cleavage of procaspase-3 and DNA fragmentation, suggesting that apicidin-induced apoptosis was dependent on de novo protein synthesis. Consistent with these results, apicidin transiently increased the expressions of both Fas and Fas ligand. Preincubation with NOK-1 monoclonal antibody, which prevents the Fas-Fas ligand interaction and is inhibitory to Fas signaling, interfered with apicidin-induced translocation of Bax, cytochrome c release, cleavage of procaspase-3, and DNA fragmentation. Taken together, the results suggest that apicidin might induce apoptosis through selective induction of Fas/Fas ligand, resulting in the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria to the cytosol and subsequent activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3.","['Kwon, So Hee', 'Ahn, Seong Hoon', 'Kim, Yong Kee', 'Bae, Gyu-Un', 'Yoon, Jong Woo', 'Hong, Sungyoul', 'Lee, Hoi Young', 'Lee, Yin-Won', 'Lee, Hyang-Woo', 'Han, Jeung-Whan']","['Kwon SH', 'Ahn SH', 'Kim YK', 'Bae GU', 'Yoon JW', 'Hong S', 'Lee HY', 'Lee YW', 'Lee HW', 'Han JW']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, College of Pharmacy and Department of Genetic Engineering, College of Life Science and Natural Resources, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon 440-746, Korea.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Cytochrome c Group)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (FASLG protein, human)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Peptides, Cyclic)', '0 (apicidin)', '0 (fas Receptor)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspase 9', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Catalysis', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'Cyclins/metabolism', 'Cytochrome c Group/metabolism', 'Cytosol/enzymology', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Fas Ligand Protein', 'HL-60 Cells', '*Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Histone Deacetylases/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydrolysis', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/metabolism/*pathology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*metabolism', 'Mitochondria/enzymology', 'Peptides, Cyclic/*pharmacology', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'fas Receptor/*metabolism']",2001/11/08 10:00,2002/02/14 10:01,['2001/11/08 10:00'],"['2001/11/08 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/02/14 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/08 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M106699200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(20)87832-6 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2002 Jan 18;277(3):2073-80. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M106699200.

E21R-induced proliferation of the BaF-B03 cells is dependent on transfection with both hGM-CSF receptor alpha and beta(c) subunits. Studies on the underlying mechanism revealed constitutive association between human and mouse beta(c) and GM-CSF receptor-alpha, tyrosine phosphorylation of mouse and human beta(c), and association of phosphorylated mouse beta(c) into an activated human GM-CSF receptor complex in response to E21R and GM-CSF. This interspecies receptor cross-talk of receptor signaling subunits may produce misleading results and emphasizes the need to use cell lines devoid of the cognate endogenous receptors for functional analysis of ligand and receptor mutants.","['McClure, B', 'Stomski, F', 'Lopez, A', 'Woodcock, J']","['McClure B', 'Stomski F', 'Lopez A', 'Woodcock J']","['Cytokine Receptor Laboratory, Hanson Centre for Cancer Research, Institute of Medical and Veterinary Science, Adelaide, South Australia.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Ligands)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Protein Subunits)', '0 (Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, Arg(21)-)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Artifacts', 'Cell Line', '*Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/pathology', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/pathology', 'Ligands', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Mice', 'Protein Multimerization', 'Protein Subunits', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', '*Receptor Cross-Talk', 'Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/chemistry/*drug effects/genetics', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/drug effects/genetics', '*Recombinant Proteins', 'Signal Transduction', 'Species Specificity', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/11/08 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/11/08 10:00'],"['2001/11/08 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/08 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood.v98.10.3165 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)56858-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2001 Nov 15;98(10):3165-8. doi: 10.1182/blood.v98.10.3165.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One hundred patients and their unrelated donors were typed by sequence-based typing for the human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A, -B, and -C loci. All pairs were matched for DRB1, DRB3, DRB4, DRB5, DQA1, and DQB1 loci. Forty pairs were also matched at class I, and 60 pairs had one or more mismatches at class I loci. It was found that substitutions at positions 116 and 114 of class I heavy chain significantly increased the risk for TRM in univariate and bivariate Cox analyses. Conversely, no association between number of multiple mismatches or number of amino acid substitutions and TRM was seen when positions 116 and 114 were adjusted for. Variables predictive of TRM in multivariate Cox analysis were number of cells infused, diagnosis (chronic myeloid leukemia [CML] or non-CML), and amino acid substitution at position 116 or 152. The only variable predictive of severe acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in multivariate Cox analysis was substitution at position 116. Actuarial risk for acute GVHD grade III-IV, TRM, and relapse in pairs with substitutions at position 116 (n = 37) compared to other pairs (n = 63) was, respectively, 36% versus 14% (P =.01), 59% versus 28% (P =.001), and 25% versus 31% (P =.4). In conclusion these data suggest that substitutions at position 116 of class I heavy chain increase the risk for acute GVHD and TRM in patients who receive transplanted bone marrow from unrelated donors.","['Ferrara, G B', 'Bacigalupo, A', 'Lamparelli, T', 'Lanino, E', 'Delfino, L', 'Morabito, A', 'Parodi, A M', 'Pera, C', 'Pozzi, S', 'Sormani, M P', 'Bruzzi, P', 'Bordo, D', 'Bolognesi, M', 'Bandini, G', 'Bontadini, A', 'Barbanti, M', 'Frumento, G']","['Ferrara GB', 'Bacigalupo A', 'Lamparelli T', 'Lanino E', 'Delfino L', 'Morabito A', 'Parodi AM', 'Pera C', 'Pozzi S', 'Sormani MP', 'Bruzzi P', 'Bordo D', 'Bolognesi M', 'Bandini G', 'Bontadini A', 'Barbanti M', 'Frumento G']","['Laboratorio di Immunogenetica, Servizio di Epidemiologia Clinica, Istituto Nazionale per la Ricerca sul Cancro, Genoa, Italy. ferrara@cba.unige.it']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,['0 (Codon)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Alleles', '*Amino Acid Substitution', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation/mortality', 'Codon/*genetics', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Exons/genetics', 'Gene Frequency', '*Genes, MHC Class I', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology/genetics/mortality', '*Histocompatibility', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Life Tables', 'Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Analysis', 'Tissue Donors', '*Transplantation, Homologous/mortality', 'Treatment Outcome']",2001/11/08 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/11/08 10:00'],"['2001/11/08 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/08 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood.v98.10.3150 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)56854-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2001 Nov 15;98(10):3150-5. doi: 10.1182/blood.v98.10.3150.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, neither induced mouse plasmacytomas nor HMCLs represent relevant models for human multiple myeloma (MM). To evaluate the incidence of c-myc rearrangements in human plasma cell dyscrasias, sets of probes were generated to allow direct assessment of c-myc translocations on interphase plasma cells by using fluorescence in situ hybridization. After validation of these probes, a large cohort of patients with either newly diagnosed MM (n = 529), relapsed MM (n = 58), primary plasma cell leukemia (PCL; n = 23), monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (n = 65), or smoldering MM (n = 24) were analyzed. C-myc rearrangements were identified in 15% of patients with MM or primary PCL, independently of the stage of the disease (ie, diagnosis or relapse and MM or primary PCL). Analysis of the 2 main translocations observed on karyotyping, ie, t(8;14) and t(8;22), revealed that these specific translocations represented only 25% (23 of 91) of c-myc rearrangements. c-myc rearrangements were then correlated with several other patients' characteristics: illegitimate IgH recombinations, chromosome 13 deletions, and serum beta2-microglobulin levels. The only significant correlation was with a high beta2-microglobulin level (P =.002), although a trend for association with t(4;14) was observed (P =.08). Thus, c-myc rearrangement analysis in patients with MM revealed a strikingly lower incidence than that in HMCLs and plasmacytomas induced in mice, indicating that data obtained with these models cannot be directly extrapolated to human MM.","['Avet-Loiseau, H', 'Gerson, F', 'Magrangeas, F', 'Minvielle, S', 'Harousseau, J L', 'Bataille, R']","['Avet-Loiseau H', 'Gerson F', 'Magrangeas F', 'Minvielle S', 'Harousseau JL', 'Bataille R']","['Hematology Laboratory, INSERM U463, and the Department of Clinical Hematology, University Hospital, Nantes, France. havetloiseau@chu-nantes.fr']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (beta 2-Microglobulin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosomes, Artificial, Yeast', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11/genetics/ultrastructure', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 13/genetics/ultrastructure', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14/genetics/ultrastructure', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 4/genetics/ultrastructure', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8/genetics/ultrastructure', 'Cohort Studies', 'DNA Probes', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Heavy Chain', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin', '*Genes, myc', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Interphase', 'Leukemia, Plasma Cell/blood/genetics', 'Mice', 'Multiple Myeloma/blood/*genetics/pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/blood/genetics', 'Paraproteinemias/blood/genetics', 'Plasmacytoma/genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'beta 2-Microglobulin/analysis']",2001/11/08 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/11/08 10:00'],"['2001/11/08 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/08 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood.v98.10.3082 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)56844-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2001 Nov 15;98(10):3082-6. doi: 10.1182/blood.v98.10.3082.,,,,,,,,,,['Intergroupe Francophone du Myelome'],,,,,,,,,,

The mean CCgR rate is 13%, in a range of 5% to 33%. A collaborative study of 9 European Union countries has led to the collection of data on 317 patients who were first seen between 1983 and 1997 and achieved CCgRs with IFN-alpha alone or in combination with hydroxyurea. The median time to first CCgR was 19 months (95% CI, 17-21; range, 3-84 months). At last contact, 212 patients were still alive and in continuous CCgR; 105 patients had lost CCgR, but 53% of them were still alive and in chronic phase. IFN-alpha treatment was discontinued permanently in 23 cases for response loss, in 36 cases for chronic toxicity (15 are still in unmaintained continuous CCgR), and in 8 cases because it was believed that treatment was no longer necessary (7 of these 8 patients are still in unmaintained continuous CCgR). The 10-year survival rate from first CCgR is 72% (95% CI, 62%-82%) and is related to the risk profile. High-risk patients lost CCgR more frequently and more rapidly and none survived more than 10 years. Low-risk patients survived much longer (10-year survival probability 89% for Sokal low risk and 81% for Euro low risk). These data point out that a substantial long-term survival in CCgRs is restricted mainly to low-risk and possibly intermediate-risk patients and occurs significantly less often in high-risk patients.","['Bonifazi, F', 'de Vivo, A', 'Rosti, G', 'Guilhot, F', 'Guilhot, J', 'Trabacchi, E', 'Hehlmann, R', 'Hochhaus, A', 'Shepherd, P C', 'Steegmann, J L', 'Kluin-Nelemans, H C', 'Thaler, J', 'Simonsson, B', 'Louwagie, A', 'Reiffers, J', 'Mahon, F X', 'Montefusco, E', 'Alimena, G', 'Hasford, J', 'Richards, S', 'Saglio, G', 'Testoni, N', 'Martinelli, G', 'Tura, S', 'Baccarani, M']","['Bonifazi F', 'de Vivo A', 'Rosti G', 'Guilhot F', 'Guilhot J', 'Trabacchi E', 'Hehlmann R', 'Hochhaus A', 'Shepherd PC', 'Steegmann JL', 'Kluin-Nelemans HC', 'Thaler J', 'Simonsson B', 'Louwagie A', 'Reiffers J', 'Mahon FX', 'Montefusco E', 'Alimena G', 'Hasford J', 'Richards S', 'Saglio G', 'Testoni N', 'Martinelli G', 'Tura S', 'Baccarani M']",,['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Immunologic Factors)', '0 (Interferon alpha-2)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/blood', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cause of Death', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Europe/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/blood', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Factors/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Interferon alpha-2', 'Interferon-alpha/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood/*drug therapy/genetics/mortality/therapy', 'Life Tables', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",2001/11/08 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/11/08 10:00'],"['2001/11/08 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/08 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood.v98.10.3074 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)56843-2 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2001 Nov 15;98(10):3074-81. doi: 10.1182/blood.v98.10.3074.,,46,,,,,,,,"['Europena Study Group on Interferon in Chronic Myeloid Leukemia', 'Italian Cooperative Study Group on CML', 'France Intergroup of CML', 'German CML Study Group', 'UK Medical Research Council Working Party on CML', 'Spanish CML Study Group', 'Australian CML Study Group', 'Swedish CML Study Group']",,,,,,,,,,

Like the nonmalignant counterparts, B-1 cells, CLL cells often express surface immunoglobulin with the capacity to bind autologous structures. Previously there has been no established link between antigen-receptor binding and inhibition of apoptosis in CLL. In this work, using primary CLL cells from untreated patients with this disease, it is demonstrated that engagement of surface IgM elicits a powerful survival program. The response includes inhibition of caspase activity, activation of NF-kappaB, and expression of mcl-1, bcl-2, and bfl-1 in the tumor cells. Blocking phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K), a critical mediator of signals through the antigen receptor, completely abrogated mcl-1 induction and impaired survival in the stimulated cells.

It has recently been reported that a cytosolic isoform of PTPepsilon (PTPepsilonC) when over-expressed in murine M1 myeloid cells inhibits interleukin-6 (IL-6)- and leukemia inhibitory factor-induced activation of Janus kinases (JAKs), thereby suppressing STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation and STAT3 signaling. This study characterizes an inhibitory action of PTPepsilonC on IL-6 signaling and also reveals that PTPepsilonC inhibitory activity is independent of other potential negative regulators, such as SHP-2 and SOCS family proteins. Furthermore, it analyzes the selectivity of PTPepsilonC action toward several cytokines. On IL-6 stimulation, expression of PTPepsilonC-DA, a catalytically inactive mutant of PTPepsilonC, results in an earlier onset of STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation, suggesting different modes of action between PTPepsilonC and other negative regulators. In addition, the study shows PTPepsilonC-DA enhances activation of STAT1 by IL-6 as well. In terms of specificity to cytokines, over-expressed PTPepsilonC also inhibits IL-10-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 in M1 cells, whereas PTPepsilonC does not affect either interferon-beta- and interferon-gamma-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STATs or expression of STAT transcriptional targets. Among cytokines tested, the inhibitory effect of PTPepsilonC is selective to IL-6- and IL-10-induced JAK-STAT signaling.","['Tanuma, N', 'Shima, H', 'Nakamura, K', 'Kikuchi, K']","['Tanuma N', 'Shima H', 'Nakamura K', 'Kikuchi K']","['Division of Biochemical Oncology and Immunology, Institute for Genetic Medicine, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-10)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (SOCS1 protein, human)', '0 (SOCS3 protein, human)', '0 (STAT1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT1 protein, human)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (Socs1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Socs3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Stat1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 1 Protein)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 3 Protein)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)', '77238-31-4 (Interferon-beta)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Jak1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (TYK2 Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (TYK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Tyk2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (PTPN11 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (PTPN6 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (PTPRE protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 6)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Ptpn11 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Ptpn6 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Ptpre protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Receptor-Like Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases, Class 4)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Carrier Proteins/physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Interferon-beta/pharmacology', 'Interferon-gamma/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-10/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Interleukin-6/*antagonists & inhibitors', '*Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Isoenzymes/genetics/*physiology', 'Janus Kinase 1', 'Mice', 'Myeloid Cells/cytology/drug effects/enzymology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 6', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases/genetics/*physiology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*physiology', 'Proteins/physiology', 'Receptor-Like Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases, Class 4', 'Receptors, Interleukin/drug effects', 'Receptors, Interleukin-10', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/physiology', '*Repressor Proteins', 'STAT1 Transcription Factor', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 1 Protein', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 3 Protein', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins', 'TYK2 Kinase', 'Trans-Activators/*physiology', '*Transcription Factors', 'Transfection']",2001/11/08 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/11/08 10:00'],"['2001/11/08 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/08 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood.v98.10.3030 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)56837-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2001 Nov 15;98(10):3030-4. doi: 10.1182/blood.v98.10.3030.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Remarkably, prostratin is also able to inhibit de novo human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection yet up-regulate viral expression from latent proviruses. Prostratin's lack of tumor promotion, coupled with its ability to block viral spread yet induce latent proviral expression, prompted studies to determine whether this compound could serve as an inductive adjuvant therapy for patients treated with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). The current experiments indicate that prostratin is a potent mitogen for mononuclear phagocytes possessing many of the activities of phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) with notable functional differences. Prostratin, like PMA, accelerates differentiation of the myeloid cell-lines, HL-60 and THP-1, as well as mononuclear phagocytes from bone marrow and peripheral blood. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and gene array analyses indicate significant changes in the expression of proteins and messenger RNA after treatment of cells with prostratin, consistent with phagocyte activation and differentiation. Prostratin blocks HIV-1 infection relating to down-regulation of CD4 receptor expression. The array analysis indicates a similar down-regulation of the HIV-1 coreceptors, CXCR4 and CCR5, and this may also reduce viral infectivity of treated host cells. Finally, prostratin is capable of up-regulating HIV-1 expression from CD8+ T lymphocyte-depleted peripheral blood mononuclear cells of patients undergoing HAART. This novel observation suggests the agent may be an excellent candidate to augment HAART by inducing expression of latent HIV-1 with the ultimate goal of eliminating persistent viral reservoirs in certain individuals infected with HIV-1.","['Kulkosky, J', 'Culnan, D M', 'Roman, J', 'Dornadula, G', 'Schnell, M', 'Boyd, M R', 'Pomerantz, R J']","['Kulkosky J', 'Culnan DM', 'Roman J', 'Dornadula G', 'Schnell M', 'Boyd MR', 'Pomerantz RJ']","['Dorrance H.

The main reason for this appears to be the low peptide-binding affinity of Ig-derived peptides to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules and their resulting low immunogenicity. This might be improved by conservative amino acid modifications at the MHC-binding residues of the peptides (heteroclitic peptides). In this study, it was found that in 18 Ig-derived peptides, that heteroclitic peptides from the Ig gene with improved binding to human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A*0201 can be used to improve CTL responses. Amino acid substitution substantially increased predicted binding affinity, and there was a strong correlation between predicted and actual binding to HLA-A*0201. CTLs generated against the heteroclitic peptide had not only enhanced cytotoxicity against the heteroclitic peptide but also increased killing of antigen-presenting cells pulsed with the native peptide. Surprisingly, no difference was observed in the frequency of T cells detected by MHC class I peptide tetramers after stimulation with the heteroclitic peptide compared with the native peptide. CTLs generated against heteroclitic peptides could kill patients' tumor cells, showing that Ig-derived peptides can be presented by the tumor cell and that the failure to mount an immune response (among other reasons) likely results from the low immunogenicity of the native Ig-derived peptide. These results suggest that heteroclitic Ig-derived peptides can enhance immunogenicity, thereby eliciting immune responses, and that they might be useful tools for enhancing immunotherapy approaches to treating B-cell malignant diseases.","['Harig, S', 'Witzens, M', 'Krackhardt, A M', 'Trojan, A', 'Barrett, P', 'Broderick, R', 'Zauls, A J', 'Gribben, J G']","['Harig S', 'Witzens M', 'Krackhardt AM', 'Trojan A', 'Barrett P', 'Broderick R', 'Zauls AJ', 'Gribben JG']","['Department of Adult Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02115, USA.']",['eng'],"['CA78378/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA81534/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (HLA-A2 Antigen)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Idiotypes)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Antigen Presentation', 'Binding Sites', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'HLA-A2 Antigen/immunology/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Idiotypes/chemistry/*immunology', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/chemistry/*immunology/metabolism', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*immunology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*immunology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/chemistry/*immunology', 'Peptide Fragments/chemistry/*immunology/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology']",2001/11/08 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/11/08 10:00'],"['2001/11/08 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/08 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood.v98.10.2999 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)56833-X [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2001 Nov 15;98(10):2999-3005. doi: 10.1182/blood.v98.10.2999.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

JAK2(-/-) embryos are severely deficient in erythropoiesis and die at an early stage of development from fetal anemia. The binding of erythropoietin (Epo) to the EpoR triggers the activation of JAK2, the phosphorylation of the EpoR, and the initiation of the EpoR signaling cascade. In addition to Epo binding to its receptor, signaling pathways downstream of the EpoR can also be stimulated by the BCR-ABL oncoprotein. This study explored whether JAK2 is required for BCR-ABL-mediated stimulation of erythropoiesis. Here, it is shown that JAK2 is constitutively tyrosine phosphorylated in cultured and primary erythroid cells expressing BCR-ABL. However, BCR-ABL effectively supports normal erythroid proliferation, differentiation, and maturation in JAK2-deficient fetal liver cells. Using mutants of BCR-ABL, this study shows that certain signaling pathways activated by BCR-ABL segments distinct from its tyrosine kinase domain are essential for rescue of erythropoiesis in JAK2(-/-) progenitors. The consequences of these multiple signaling pathways for normal erythroid development are discussed.","['Ghaffari, S', 'Kitidis, C', 'Fleming, M D', 'Neubauer, H', 'Pfeffer, K', 'Lodish, H F']","['Ghaffari S', 'Kitidis C', 'Fleming MD', 'Neubauer H', 'Pfeffer K', 'Lodish HF']","['Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research and Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA 02142, USA.']",['eng'],['HL-32262/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Erythropoietin)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Jak2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Substitution', 'Anemia/blood/embryology/genetics/pathology', 'Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Electroporation', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Erythropoiesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Fetal Death/etiology', 'Fetal Diseases/blood/genetics/pathology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/*physiology', 'Gestational Age', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors/physiology', 'Janus Kinase 2', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/pathology', 'Liver/embryology/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*deficiency/genetics/physiology', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Receptors, Erythropoietin/physiology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/physiology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",2001/11/08 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/11/08 10:00'],"['2001/11/08 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/08 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood.v98.10.2948 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)56826-2 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2001 Nov 15;98(10):2948-57. doi: 10.1182/blood.v98.10.2948.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) and RAEB-t were excluded. Standard French-American-British (FAB) and new WHO classifications have been compared in a series of patients (n = 431) from a single center, analyzing morphologic, clinical, and cytogenetic data. According to the WHO findings, dysgranulocytopoiesis or dysmegakaryocytopoiesis only were found in 26% of patients with less than 5% medullary blasts. These patients are thus unclassified and should remain in the subgroups RA and RARS. Splitting of heterogeneous RAEB into 2 subgroups according to blast count was supported by a trend to a statistically significant difference in the single-center study population. Patients with CMML whose white blood cell counts are above 13 000/microL may be excluded from the MDS classification, as warranted by WHO, but a redistribution of patients with dysplastic CMML according to medullary blast count leads to more heterogeneity in other WHO subgroups. Although the natural courses of RAEB-T and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with dysplasia are different, comparable median survival durations after treatment in patients with RAEB-T and AML were in favor of the proposed 20% medullary blast threshold for AML. The homogeneity of subgroups was studied by evaluating prognostic scores. A significant shift into lower IPSS risk groups was evident in the new classification. These data cannot provide evidence for the new WHO proposal, which should not be adopted for routine clinical use at present. Some of its aspects can provide a starting point for further studies involving refined cytogenetics and clinical results.","['Nosslinger, T', 'Reisner, R', 'Koller, E', 'Gruner, H', 'Tuchler, H', 'Nowotny, H', 'Pittermann, E', 'Pfeilstocker, M']","['Nosslinger T', 'Reisner R', 'Koller E', 'Gruner H', 'Tuchler H', 'Nowotny H', 'Pittermann E', 'Pfeilstocker M']","['Third Medical Department for Hematology and Oncology and the Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Leukemia Research and Hematology, Hanusch Hospital, Vienna, Austria. thomas.noesslinger@wgkk.sozvers.at']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cell Count', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/blood/classification/mortality/pathology', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Life Tables', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/blood/*classification/mortality/pathology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'World Health Organization']",2001/11/08 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/11/08 10:00'],"['2001/11/08 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/08 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood.v98.10.2935 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)56824-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2001 Nov 15;98(10):2935-41. doi: 10.1182/blood.v98.10.2935.,,,,,,"['Blood. 2002 Apr 15;99(8):3074-5.

The impact was evaluated of matching donors and recipients for HLA-DR, HLA-DQ, and HLA-DP genes on clinical outcome after stem cell transplantation for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) performed between 1988 and 1997. HLA-DRB1, -DQA1, -DQB1, -DPA1, and -DPB1 alleles were identified in 831 transplant pairs using a combination of sequence-specific oligonucleotide probes, sequence-specific priming, and sequencing methods. Among the 831 pairs, 696 (84%) were HLA-A and -B serologically matched; of these, 565 (81%) were also matched for HLA-DRB1. HLA-DRB1 matching correlated with significantly improved survival (relative risk [RR], 1.29 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.02-1.64; P =.04]) independently of HLA-DQA1 or HLA-DQB1 (RR, 1.01 [95% CI, 0.81-1.26; P =.94]) and HLA-DPA1 or HLA-DPB1 (RR, 1.11 [95% CI, 0.84-1.48; P =.46]). Single-locus HLA-DQ or HLA-DP disparity was not associated with significantly poorer survival. For patients who underwent transplantation in the first chronic phase (CP) from HLA-A, B matched donors, the presence of DRB1 allele mismatching was independently associated with increased incidence of grades III-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). No significant associations of class II allele mismatching with risk for delayed engraftment or chronic GVHD disease were detected. This study clearly demonstrates the importance of precise matching of HLA-DRB1 alleles for successful transplantation. Furthermore, a good-risk population of patients whose transplantations were performed in the first CP of disease from HLA-A, B, DRB1 matched unrelated donors can be shown to have superior survival.","['Petersdorf, E W', 'Kollman, C', 'Hurley, C K', 'Dupont, B', 'Nademanee, A', 'Begovich, A B', 'Weisdorf, D', 'McGlave, P']","['Petersdorf EW', 'Kollman C', 'Hurley CK', 'Dupont B', 'Nademanee A', 'Begovich AB', 'Weisdorf D', 'McGlave P']","['Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, the U.S. National Marrow Donor Program, Georgetown University, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (HLA-D Antigens)', '0 (HLA-DP Antigens)', '0 (HLA-DQ Antigens)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (HLA-DRB1 Chains)']",IM,"['Alleles', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', '*Genes, MHC Class II', 'Graft Survival', 'Graft vs Host Disease/epidemiology/etiology/prevention & control', 'HLA-D Antigens/genetics/*immunology', 'HLA-DP Antigens/genetics/immunology', 'HLA-DQ Antigens/genetics/immunology', 'HLA-DR Antigens/genetics/immunology', 'HLA-DRB1 Chains', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/statistics & numerical data', '*Histocompatibility', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/mortality/*therapy', 'Life Tables', 'Male', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Registries/statistics & numerical data', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', '*Tissue Donors', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Treatment Outcome', 'United States/epidemiology']",2001/11/08 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/11/08 10:00'],"['2001/11/08 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/08 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood.v98.10.2922 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)56822-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2001 Nov 15;98(10):2922-9. doi: 10.1182/blood.v98.10.2922.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-eight patients (median age 30 years, range 5-54) receiving HLA-identical sibling bone marrow transplantation for hematologic malignancies were analyzed. RESULTS: Median number (range) of nucleated cells and CD34+ cells infused were 2.4 (0.4-6.0) x 10(8)/kg and 3.5 (0.5-13.0) x 10(6)/kg, respectively. Probability of neutrophil recovery was 97%. In a multivariate analysis, time to neutrophil recovery was shortened when a higher number of CD3/CD8 cells was infused (> or =1.0 x 10(7)/kg) (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.13, p = 0.018); when the patient was female or had negative cytomegalovirus serology (HR = 2.03, p = 0.03; HR = 0.41, p = 0.009; respectively). The incidence of grade II to IV acute graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) was 47%. Infusion of >1 x 10(7) CD4 infused/kg increased the risk of acute GVHD (HR = 2.86, p = 0.03). Nineteen of 40 patients at risk experienced chronic GVHD, the risk of which was increased by diagnosis of chronic leukemia (p = 0.03), <2.0 x 10(8) nucleated cells infused/kg (p = 0.05), and a low number of all lymphocyte subsets, except CD19. Estimated 3-year survival rate was 54%. Risk of death was increased in patients receiving <3.5 x 10(6)CD34 infused/kg (HR = 0.37, p = 0.02). Only six patients relapsed. CONCLUSIONS: A high cell dose of CD3/CD8 is associated with faster neutrophil recovery, whereas a high cell dose of CD4+ cells increases the incidence of acute GVHD.

However, leukemia in the graft may contribute to posttransplant relapse. Treatment of the graft with 4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide (4HC) is sometimes used to decrease numbers of infused leukemia cells (4HC purging). No large controlled trials evaluating efficacy and toxicity of 4HC purging are reported. METHODS: We studied 294 patients reported to the Autologous Blood and Marrow Registry receiving either a 4HC-purged (n = 211) or unpurged (n = 83) autograft for AML in first (n = 209) or second (n = 85) remission. Analyses were restricted to patients transplanted less than 6 months after achieving remission. Using Cox proportional hazards regression, we compared time to treatment failure (death or relapse, inverse of leukemia-free survival) after 4HC-purged vs unpurged transplants while controlling for important prognostic factors. RESULTS: Median duration of posttransplant neutropenia was 40 (range, 10-200) days after 4HC-purged transplants and 29 (9-97) days after unpurged transplants (p < 0.01). Transplant-related mortality was similar in the two groups. In multivariate analysis, patients receiving 4HC-purged transplants had lower risks of treatment failure than those receiving unpurged transplants (relative risk, 0.69, p = 0.12 in the first posttransplant year; relative risk, 0.28, p < 0.0001 thereafter). Adjusted three-year probabilities of leukemia-free survival (95% confidence interval) were 56% (47-64%) and 31% (18-45%) after 4HC-purged and unpurged transplants in first remission, respectively. Corresponding probabilities in second remission were 39% (25-53%) and 10% (1-29%). CONCLUSION: Grafts purged with 4HC are associated with higher leukemia-free survival after autologous bone marrow transplants for AML.","['Miller, C B', 'Rowlings, P A', 'Zhang, M J', 'Jones, R J', 'Piantadosi, S', 'Keating, A', 'Armitage, J O', 'Calderwood, S', 'Harris, R E', 'Klein, J P', 'Lazarus, H M', 'Linker, C A', 'Sobocinski, K A', 'Weisdorf, D', 'Horowitz, M M']","['Miller CB', 'Rowlings PA', 'Zhang MJ', 'Jones RJ', 'Piantadosi S', 'Keating A', 'Armitage JO', 'Calderwood S', 'Harris RE', 'Klein JP', 'Lazarus HM', 'Linker CA', 'Sobocinski KA', 'Weisdorf D', 'Horowitz MM']","['The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.']",['eng'],['U24-CA 76518/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'U880A4FUDA (perfosfamide)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Americas/epidemiology', '*Bone Marrow Purging/*methods', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*methods/mortality', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Cyclophosphamide/*analogs & derivatives', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Graft Survival', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/mortality/pathology/*therapy', 'Life Tables', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Registries', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",2001/11/08 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/11/08 10:00'],"['2001/11/08 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/08 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-472X(01)00732-9 [pii]', '10.1016/s0301-472x(01)00732-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2001 Nov;29(11):1336-46. doi: 10.1016/s0301-472x(01)00732-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The acute ethanol (200 mM, 5 min) enhancement of adenylyl cyclase activity was significantly reduced after chronic ethanol treatment. We also observed a reduction in phorbol-12,13-dibutyrate (PDB) enhancement of prostaglandin E1-stimulation after chronic ethanol treatment. Chronic ethanol treatment (50 or 100 mM) reduced the activity of adenylyl cyclase in response to stimulation by acute ethanol to a greater extent than that of after acute PDB. The increase in cAMP formation by ethanol and PDB was only evident when prostaglandin E1 was present and under basal conditions (when no stimulatory agent was present) ethanol up to 200 mM, and PDB up to 1 M, had no significant effect on adenylyl cyclase activity.

The prognostic significance of the presence of c-Kit in acute myeloid leukemia is debated. Recently, c-kit inhibitors have been studied as possible therapies against hematopoietic malignancies; therefore, c-Kit detection may have important implications for treatment. OBJECTIVES: In this study, we investigated the expression of c-Kit in granulocytic sarcoma (GS) using paraffin-embedded tissue. DESIGN: Routinely formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues from 30 cases of GS were studied using immunohistochemistry. c-Kit (C-19) (a polyclonal antibody against carboxy terminal domain of c-Kit p145 or CD117) reactivity was compared with myeloperoxidase and lysozyme. The immunohistochemical panel also included CD34, CD68, CD43, Bcl-2, CD45RB, CD20, CD3, CD10, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT), and CD79a. RESULTS: The morphologic patterns included well-differentiated (5 cases), poorly differentiated (19 cases), and blastic forms (6 cases). Clinical data were obtained from 28 of 30 patients. Granulocytic sarcoma presented in lymph nodes in 10 cases, whereas in 20 cases it presented in extranodal sites. c-Kit reactivity was found in 87% (26/30) of the GS cases. There was no significant difference in c-Kit positivity between the nodal (90%, 9/10) and extranodal (85%, 17/20) neoplasms. c-Kit expression was not associated with the degree of the myeloid maturation. Two of 13 lymphoblastic lymphoma control cases and 1 of 28 of the large B-cell lymphomas were weakly immunoreactive with c-Kit. CONCLUSIONS: c-Kit reactivity can be demonstrated in a high percentage of GS cases; its presence may be useful not only in diagnosis, but also in the treatment of GS with new modalities.","['Chen, J', 'Yanuck, R R 3rd', 'Abbondanzo, S L', 'Chu, W S', 'Aguilera, N S']","['Chen J', 'Yanuck RR 3rd', 'Abbondanzo SL', 'Chu WS', 'Aguilera NS']","['Department of Hematopathology, Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, Washington, DC 20306-6000, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Arch Pathol Lab Med,Archives of pathology & laboratory medicine,7607091,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Breast Neoplasms/immunology/pathology', 'Child', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Granulocytes/*immunology/pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Intestinal Neoplasms/immunology/pathology', 'Intestine, Small', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/immunology/pathology', 'Lymph Nodes/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/*analysis', 'Sarcoma/*immunology/pathology', 'Skin Neoplasms/immunology/pathology', 'Testicular Neoplasms/immunology/pathology']",2001/11/08 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/11/08 10:00'],"['2001/11/08 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/08 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.5858/2001-125-1448-CKCRIE [doi]'],ppublish,Arch Pathol Lab Med. 2001 Nov;125(11):1448-52. doi: 10.5858/2001-125-1448-CKCRIE.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, after infection the virus enters into a dormant state, whereas the characteristics of the HTLV-I related diseases indicate that their genesis requires activation of the dormant virus by a Tax-independent mechanism. In the present study we demonstrate that a variety of stress-inducing agents (TPA, cisplatin, etoposide, taxol, and 3-methylcholanthrene) are capable of Tax-independent activation of HTLV-I LTR and that this activation is detected mainly in cells that are undergoing through the apoptotic process. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that both apoptosis induction and HTLV-I LTR activation are inhibited by Bcl-2 and by PKC, indicating that these two processes are mechanistically cross-linked. In addition, using an HTLV-I producing human T-cell line which permanently express the negatively transdominant tax mutant, Delta58tax, under the Tet-Off control system, we prove that the virally encoded Tax protein protects the host cells from apoptosis. Together, these data suggest that activation of the dormant virus in the carriers' infected T-cells by certain stress-inducing conditions and protecting these cells from the consequent apoptotic death by the viral Tax protein emerging after this activation, might be the basis for switching the virus from latency to a pathogenic phase.","['Torgeman, A', 'Ben-Aroya, Z', 'Grunspan, A', 'Zelin, E', 'Butovsky, E', 'Hallak, M', 'Lochelt, M', 'Flugel, R M', 'Livneh, E', 'Wolfson, M', 'Kedar, I', 'Aboud, M']","['Torgeman A', 'Ben-Aroya Z', 'Grunspan A', 'Zelin E', 'Butovsky E', 'Hallak M', 'Lochelt M', 'Flugel RM', 'Livneh E', 'Wolfson M', 'Kedar I', 'Aboud M']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Ben Gurion University of the Negev, Beer Sheva, 84105, Israel.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Protein Synthesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '56-49-5 (Methylcholanthrene)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'F8VB5M810T (Tetracycline)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Carcinogens/pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Cisplatin/pharmacology', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*physiology', 'Gene Products, tax/genetics/*metabolism', 'Genes, Reporter/genetics', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Methylcholanthrene/pharmacology', 'Paclitaxel/pharmacology', 'Protein Isoforms/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase C/metabolism', 'Protein Synthesis Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/*physiology/*virology', 'Terminal Repeat Sequences/*genetics', 'Tetracycline/pharmacology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Transfection']",2001/11/08 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/11/08 10:00'],"['2001/11/08 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/08 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1006/excr.2001.5363 [doi]', 'S0014-4827(01)95363-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 2001 Nov 15;271(1):169-79. doi: 10.1006/excr.2001.5363.,['Copyright 2001 Academic Press.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we investigated the potential synergistic effect of all-trans retinoic acid (RA), 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (VD3), and sodium butyrate (NaB) on TPA-induced differentiation in HL-60 human promyelocytic leukemia cells. The cells were treated once with these agents for 48 h or treated every 24 h for 96 h. Treatment of HL-60 cells once with TPA, RA, VD3, or NaB for 48 h resulted in concentration-dependent growth inhibition and cell differentiation. At clinically achievable concentrations, TPA (0.16 nM) increased the number of adherent cells and RA (0.1-1 microM) increased the number of nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT)-positive cells. The combinations of TPA (0.16 nM) with RA (0.1-1 microM), VD3 (1 nM), or NaB (100 microM) for 48 h synergistically increased differentiation as measured by the formation of adherent cells (P < or = 0.01). Moreover, cells treated with various combinations of low concentrations of TPA, RA, VD3, and NaB every 24 h for 96 h resulted in a further decrease in cell growth and an increase in differentiation. At clinically achievable concentrations, the strongest stimulation of differentiation was achieved in cells treated with a ""cocktail"" that combined TPA, RA, VD3, and NaB. The synergistic effect of combinations of TPA with RA or NaB at clinically effective concentrations on HL-60 cell differentiation suggests that the combination of these agents may improve the therapeutic efficacy of TPA for the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) patients.

To elucidate the biochemical mechanisms leading to cell death, the effects produced by these gold(III) complexes on the leukemic CCRF-CEM cell line--either sensitive (CCRF-CEM) or resistant to cisplatin (CCRF-CEM/CDDP)--were analyzed in detail by various techniques. For comparison purposes the effects produced by equitoxic concentrations of cisplatin were also analyzed. First, the dependence of the IC50 values of either complex on the incubation time was investigated. Cytotoxicity experiments confirmed that both gold(III) compounds retain their efficacy against the cisplatin-resistant line: only minimal cross-resistance with cisplatin was detected. Notably, [Au(phen)Cl2]Cl is more cytotoxic than [Au(dien)Cl]Cl2, with IC50 values of 7.4 and 6.0 M at 24 and 72 h, respectively, on the resistant line. Results of the COMET assay point out that both gold(III) complexes directly damage nuclear DNA. Remarkably, DNA damage inferred by either gold(III) complex in the two cell lines is larger than that produced by equitoxic cisplatin concentrations. Finally, the effects that either gold(III) complex produces on the cell cycle were investigated by flow cytometry. It was found that both complexes cause only moderate and transient cell cycle perturbations. Larger cell cycle perturbations are induced by equitoxic concentrations of cisplatin. The implications of the present results for the mechanism of action of cytotoxic gold(III) complexes are discussed.","['Coronnello, M', 'Marcon, G', 'Carotti, S', 'Caciagli, B', 'Mini, E', 'Mazzei, T', 'Orioli, P', 'Messori, L']","['Coronnello M', 'Marcon G', 'Carotti S', 'Caciagli B', 'Mini E', 'Mazzei T', 'Orioli P', 'Messori L']","['Department of Pharmacology, University of Florence, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Oncol Res,Oncology research,9208097,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '7440-57-5 (Gold)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/*drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cisplatin/*pharmacology', 'Comet Assay', 'DNA', '*DNA Damage', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gold/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Models, Chemical', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/11/08 10:00,2002/04/16 10:01,['2001/11/08 10:00'],"['2001/11/08 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/04/16 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/08 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.3727/096504001108747828 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncol Res. 2000;12(9-10):361-70. doi: 10.3727/096504001108747828.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Gemtuzumab ozogamicin is an antibody-chemotherapeutic conjugate characterized as antibody-targeted chemotherapy, consisting of an engineered human anti-CD33 antibody (hP67.6) linked to a potent cytotoxic agent, N-acetyl-gamma calicheamicin DMH. The pharmacokinetics of gemtuzumab ozogamicin was evaluated in 59 adult AML patients in first relapse, enrolled in a phase II study. Plasma was collected following each dose at specified times, and the pharmacokinetics was characterized by measures of hP67.6, total calicheamicin derivatives, and unconjugated calicheamicin derivatives. After administration of the first 9 mg/m2 dose of gemtuzumab ozogamicin, the pharmacokinetic parameters (mean +/- SD) of hP67.6 following the first dose were as follows: peak plasma concentration, 2.86 +/- 1.35 mg/L; AUC, 123 +/- 105 mg x h/L; t 1/2, 72.4 +/- 42.0 hours; and clearance, 0.265 +/- 0.229L/h. Increased concentrations were observed after the second dose and are believed to be due to a decrease in clearance by CD33-positive blast cells, a result of the reduced tumor burden following the first dose. The concentration profiles of calicheamicin followed the same time course as hP67.6, evidence that calicheamicin remained conjugated to the antibody and delivered to leukemic cells. No relationship was found between plasma concentration and response at the recommended dose. The pharmacokinetics of gemtuzumab ozogamicin has been characterized in AML patients receiving doses at the proposed therapeutic level.","['Dowell, J A', 'Korth-Bradley, J', 'Liu, H', 'King, S P', 'Berger, M S']","['Dowell JA', 'Korth-Bradley J', 'Liu H', 'King SP', 'Berger MS']","['Wyeth-Ayerst Research, Radnor, Pennsylvania, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Clin Pharmacol,Journal of clinical pharmacology,0366372,"['0 (Aminoglycosides)', '0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CD33 protein, human)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Enediynes)', '0 (Immunotoxins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3)', '108212-75-5 (calicheamicin gamma(1)I)', '93NS566KF7 (Gemtuzumab)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Aminoglycosides', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/blood/chemistry/*pharmacokinetics', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/blood/pharmacokinetics', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/blood/chemistry/*pharmacokinetics', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antigens, CD/*metabolism', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/*metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Area Under Curve', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/metabolism', 'Enediynes', 'Female', 'Gemtuzumab', 'Humans', 'Immunotoxins/blood/chemistry/*pharmacokinetics', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/*metabolism/prevention & control', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/metabolism', 'Metabolic Clearance Rate', 'Middle Aged', 'Models, Biological', 'Recurrence', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3']",2001/11/08 10:00,2002/04/16 10:01,['2001/11/08 10:00'],"['2001/11/08 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/04/16 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/08 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/00912700122012751 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Pharmacol. 2001 Nov;41(11):1206-14. doi: 10.1177/00912700122012751.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In all patients, FISH detected 1% to 12% nuclei with a BCR-ABL fusion gene, whereas Q-RT-PCR were negative or weakly positive. Based on these results, we hypothesize that the BCR-ABL genomic rearrangement remains unexpressed in a small percentage of cells whatever the treatment (IFN-alpha or BMT), and this in spite of the negativity of the RT-PCR-based classical molecular remission criterion.

Experimental models suggesting the persistence of positive BCR-ABL cells are discussed and tentative explanations of tumor ""dormancy"" are proposed.","['Kitzis, A', 'Brizard, F', 'Dascalescu, C', 'Chomel, J C', 'Guilhot, F', 'Brizard, A']","['Kitzis A', 'Brizard F', 'Dascalescu C', 'Chomel JC', 'Guilhot F', 'Brizard A']","['Laboratoire de Genetique Cellulaire et Moleculaire, UPRES EA 2622, CHU de Poitiers, France. a.kitzis@chu-poitiers.fr']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Chromosomes, Human, Pair 22', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', '*Gene Rearrangement', 'Gene Silencing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Neoplasm, Residual/diagnosis/genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic']",2001/11/08 10:00,2002/02/16 10:01,['2001/11/08 10:00'],"['2001/11/08 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/02/16 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/08 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428190109097712 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2001 Sep-Oct;42(5):933-44. doi: 10.3109/10428190109097712.,,74,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While the association between molecular remission (MR) in bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood (PB) and long-term clinical remission (CR) seems to be established, there are insufficient data on the kinetics of CBFbeta/MYH11. We have performed a prospective study in order to generate a reasonable and sufficient schedule for PCR-monitoring. 11 patients with AML and inversion (16) in complete hematological remission have been prospectively monitored by CBFbeta/MYH11 RT-PCR in their BM and PB during an observation period of 7 to 67 months (median 32 months). Patients were followed during consolidation chemotherapy with repetitive cycles of high-dose Ara-C and after autologous or allogeneic stem cell transplantation in 2nd CR or refractory AML. MR never coincided with achievement of CR but occurred between 2 and 8 months after hematological remission. All patients in continuous CR were PCR-negative after 1-8 (median 4) months. Two patients relapsed despite MR for 10 to 15 months. Molecular relapse preceded hematological relapse by 3 to 5 months. Three out of four patients who were not in MR after 8 months relapsed. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation was able to eradicate minimal residual disease in 4/4 patients. In 2 patients a temporary reconversion to PCR-positivity was reversed by reduction of immunosuppression. 1 patient did not become PCR-negative until compete withdrawal of immunosuppression. We suggest that BM and PB should be examined after the last consolidation treatment. In case of MR, PB should be examined every 1 to 2 months and BM examination should be done only in case of PCR-positivity in PB in order to confirm the molecular relapse and to identify an impending cytogenetic and/or hematological relapse. CBFbeta/MYH11 RT-PCR monitoring is able to predict relapse 3 to 5 months prior to overt hematological relapse, offers a window of opportunity for preemptive therapy of molecular relapse and confers implications for immunotherapy in the setting of allografting.","['Laczika, K', 'Mitterbauer, G', 'Mitterbauer, M', 'Knobl, P', 'Schwarzinger, I', 'Greinix, H T', 'Rabitsch, W', 'Fonatsch, C', 'Mannhalter, C', 'Lechner, K', 'Jaeger, U']","['Laczika K', 'Mitterbauer G', 'Mitterbauer M', 'Knobl P', 'Schwarzinger I', 'Greinix HT', 'Rabitsch W', 'Fonatsch C', 'Mannhalter C', 'Lechner K', 'Jaeger U']","['Department of Medicine I, University of Vienna, Austria.

This conflict of opinion firstly depends on difficulties to determine the quantity of fibers exactly (semiquantitative grading, morphometry, reference to cellularity). Secondly, the appropriate selection of patients with specific monotherapies including hydroxyurea (HU) and interferon-alpha (IFN) seems to present some problems. Finally, assessment of myelofibrosis is further biased by the different endpoints of sequential examinations. The latter shortcoming can be improved upon by the calculation of the myelofibrosis progression/regression index which describes the ratio between difference of fiber density and observation time. Using strictly defined therapeutic regimens and intervals between sequential trephine biopsies a stimulating effect of IFN administration on bone marrow fibrosis in Ph1+-chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) has been found. This result is comparable with the failure of this agent to improve myelofibrosis (and splenomegaly) in a considerable number of patients with allied subtypes of chronic myeloproliferative disorders. This is in contrast to the effect HU exerts which is a more fibrolytic or even stabilizing influence on bone marrow fibrosis. This phenomenon is readily demonstrable by the assessment of dynamic features (myelofibrosis progression index). In addition, patients showing a rapid progression of myelofibrosis during IFN and HU treatment of Ph1+-CML are generally associated with a poor risk outcome and a significant worsening of survival.","['Thiele, J', 'Kvasnicka, H M']","['Thiele J', 'Kvasnicka HM']","['Institute of Pathology, University of Cologne, Germany. j.thiele@uni-koeln.de']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['9008-11-1 (Interferons)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",IM,"['Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Interferons/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/*chemically induced/diagnosis/etiology', 'Prognosis']",2001/11/08 10:00,2002/02/16 10:01,['2001/11/08 10:00'],"['2001/11/08 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/02/16 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/08 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428190109097704 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2001 Sep-Oct;42(5):855-62. doi: 10.3109/10428190109097704.,,38,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) alterations of the INK4a-ARF tumour suppressor locus are rarely found despite the noted variable p16INK4a mRNA and protein levels. The p14ARF, an alternative reading frame protein encoded from the same INK4a-ARF locus, is a potent tumour suppressor functionally linked to p53. There is little known regarding the role of p14ARF in primary human tumours. Therefore, we analysed the expression patterns of these two tumour suppressors in 37 cases of AML. The relative expression of p16INK4a and p14ARF mRNA in AML blasts, measured by a specific p16INK4a/p14ARF multiplex RT-PCR, was significantly shifted towards p14ARF whereas relatively lower levels of p16INK4a were detected. Quantitative RT-PCR revealed significantly higher expression of both transcripts in AML blasts when compared to normal differentiated myeloid cells or CD34+ progenitor cells. Furthermore, a good correlation between p16INK4a protein and mRNA was observed, whereas no correlation was found with p14ARF. Our results suggest: a) increased levels of both p16INK4a and p14ARF may participate in the pathogenesis of AML, b) that high p14ARF mRNA expression might influence p16INK4a transcription and c) that post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms are important for p14ARF expression.","['Tschan, M P', 'Vonlanthen, S', 'Cajot, J F', 'Peters, U R', 'Oppliger, E', 'Betticher, D C', 'Yarbrough, W G', 'Fey, M F', 'Tobler, A']","['Tschan MP', 'Vonlanthen S', 'Cajot JF', 'Peters UR', 'Oppliger E', 'Betticher DC', 'Yarbrough WG', 'Fey MF', 'Tobler A']","['Department of Clinical Research, University and Inselspital, Berne, Switzerland.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p14ARF)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/etiology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Leukocytes/cytology/metabolism', 'RNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Stem Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p14ARF/genetics/*metabolism']",2001/11/08 10:00,2002/02/16 10:01,['2001/11/08 10:00'],"['2001/11/08 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/02/16 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/08 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428190109097728 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2001 Sep-Oct;42(5):1077-87. doi: 10.3109/10428190109097728.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of bcl-2 or cell cycle regulatory protein expression in peripheral blood cells before and during the first 48 hours of corticotherapy, and corticosensitivity criteria for predicting relapse and prognosis. Fifty two children presenting with ALL were studied at diagnosis and during the first 48 hours of treatment for the level of cell proliferation by measurement of DNA content, and for expression of several cell proliferation regulatory proteins by Western blot. Two criteria for corticosensitivity were used: 1--the number of blast cells present after seven days of treatment with a threshold at 1 G/L (usual criterion), 2--the D8/D1 blast cell ratio, which is independent of the initial leucocytosis. Relapse in the total patient population or in B-cell ALL could only be predicted by the level of leucocytosis before treatment or by p27kip1 expression during the first 48 hours of treatment. Disease free survival was significantly longer when the D8/D1 blast cell ratio was under the 0.75 quartile in the entire patient population (p = 0.03). Among the proteins analyzed, bcl-2 expression before treatment and p27kip1 expression analyzed after 48 hours of corticotherapy were the sole variables associated with significant differences in disease free survival duration in the entire patient population (p < 0.01 and p = 0.04 respectively) or in the B-cell ALL subgroup (p < 0.01). Comparable results were obtained for the overall survival data.

Carboxyamido-triazole (CAI) is a cytostatic signal transduction inhibitor currently being tested in phase II clinical trials. Based on this, we investigated the in vitro activity of CAI in mononuclear cell isolates from patients with B-CLL (n=11). Viability, utilizing the MTT assay, was assessed at varying concentrations (0.01-100 microM) of CAI for 4 days. The CAI concentration required for 50% inhibition of cell viability (LC50), determined by the tetrazolium dye (MTT) assay, at 4 days was 53.5 microM (range 29-74.6; 95% CI+/-14.8). Cells from 6 of 11 patients (3 of whom were clinically fludarabine refractory) had a 27 percent (range 11-43) mean decline in viability at 10 microM after a 4 day drug exposure, a concentration readily attainable in humans. To assess if loss of viability was due to apoptosis, we incubated cells from 4 additional CLL patients with media or CAI (10 microM) for 4 days. Annexin-V/propidium iodine labeling subsequently demonstrated CAI significantly (p=0.049) induces apoptosis (40.1%; 95% CI+/-18.1) as compared to media matched control cells (18.3%; 95% CI+/-11.2). These data provide evidence that CAI can induce apoptosis in human CLL cells in vitro at drug concentrations attainable in vivo.

However, the molecular mechanisms for sensitivity and resistance of tumor cells towards chemotherapy are still partially understood. Antineoplasic drugs have been shown to induce apoptosis in chemosensitive leukemias and solid tumors. In this work, cross-resistance among vincristine (VCR), doxorubicin (DOX) and other antineoplasic agents commonly used in the treatment of leukemia such as etoposide (VP-16), methotrexate (MTX), cyclophosphamide (CTX), dexamethasone (DEX), cytarabine (Ara-C) and L-asparaginase on vincristine resistant (LBR-V160), doxorubicin resistant (LBR-D160) and sensitive (LBR-) murine leukemic T cell lines, was determined. The effect of antineoplasic agents was assayed by tritiated thymidine incorporation. Our results showed that VCR exhibited cross-resistance with DOX, VP-16, DEX and MTX, while DOX demonstrated cross-resistance with VCR, VP-16 and MTX. Ara-C failed to present cross-resistance with any cell line. Apoptosis induced by the above drugs on the same cell lines was analyzed by acridine orange and ethidium bromide staining, DNA hypoploidy (flow cytometry) and oligonucleosomal fragmentation of nuclear DNA showing that therapeutic concentrations of these chemotherapeutic agents induced apoptosis in the LBR- cell line.

This persistence, which is not associated with hematological relapse, limits the clinical use of qualitative RT-PCR. Here, we present a new quantitative real-time PCR method to detect AML1-ETO rearrangement using fluorescently labeled probes. Quantitative detection of AML1-ETO was performed in capillary tubes using two fluorescently labeled probes in the LightCycler equipment. The reliability of the method was checked in twenty-two bone marrow samples and one apheresis sample from eight patients with t(8;21) collected at diagnosis and during follow-up assessment. The regression coefficients obtained for standard curves of AML1-ETO and AML were all greater than 0.98. The sensitivity attained allowed the detection of rearrangements at a dilution of 10(-5) Kasumi-1 cDNA. The intra-assay coefficient of variation was 4% for AML1-ETO, and 7% for AML. The inter-assay coefficient of variation was 19% for AML1-ETO and 12% for AML. A log reduction from two to four in the AML1-ETO/AML ratio was evident after CR. The study of the method and first results obtained in patient samples support that quantitative real-time PCR with hybridization probes is a new reliable and sensitive method to monitor minimal residual disease in AML patients. Moreover, the fluorescent probes with the Light-Cycler technology offer the advantage of a rapid detection.","['Barragan, E', 'Bolufer, P', 'Moreno, I', 'Martin, G', 'Nomdedeu, J', 'Brunet, S', 'Fernandez, P', 'Rivas, C', 'Sanz, M A']","['Barragan E', 'Bolufer P', 'Moreno I', 'Martin G', 'Nomdedeu J', 'Brunet S', 'Fernandez P', 'Rivas C', 'Sanz MA']","['Department of Clinical Pathology, Hospital Universitario La Fe Valencia, Spain.']",['eng'],,"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (AML1-ETO fusion protein, human)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'DNA Probes', 'Female', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/diagnosis/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm, Residual/diagnosis/genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Reference Standards', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/*standards', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic']",2001/11/08 10:00,2002/09/18 10:01,['2001/11/08 10:00'],"['2001/11/08 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/18 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/08 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428190109099337 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2001 Aug;42(4):747-56. doi: 10.3109/10428190109099337.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (B-CLL), IL4 is involved in the mechanism of survival of the leukaemic B-cells. The present study examines the expression and production of IL4 by B- and T-lymphocytes derived from patients with B-CLL and provides evidence that IL4 is not an autocrine factor in B-CLL. Freshly isolated B-CLL cells enriched for B- and T-cells did not express mRNA for IL4 but expressed mRNA for IL4 receptor (IL4R). Activation of B-cells with phorbol ester and calcium ionophore and of T-cells with phytohaemaglutinin (PHA) upregulated IL4 mRNA expression. However phorbol ester and calcium ionophore did not affect the mean level of IL4 production by either B-CLL or normal B-cells. Furthermore, in the presence or absence of activation, the amount of IL4 synthesised by B-CLL B-cells was not significantly different than that observed with peripheral blood B-cells isolated from normal individuals (with activation: P=0.239; without activation: P=0.565). Also, there was no significant difference between normal and B-CLL B-cells in the level of cytoplasmic IL4 (P=0.47). PHA-activated enriched B-CLL T-cells produced significantly higher levels of IL4 compared to normal control T-cells (P=0.0136). In addition, in 47% of cases with B-CLL T-cells, a significant higher level of intracellular IL4 was observed (P=0.0027). The levels of production of IL4 by the T-cell-enriched preparations correlated positively with the intensity of cytoplasmic L4 in CD4+ and CD8+ cells in tested samples (r=0.49 and r=0.76, respectively). The significant differences observed in the production of IL4 by B-CLL B- and T-lymphocytes may suggest a paracrine function of IL4 in B-CLL.","['Mainou-Fowler, T', 'Proctor, S J', 'Miller, S', 'Dickinson, A M']","['Mainou-Fowler T', 'Proctor SJ', 'Miller S', 'Dickinson AM']","['University Department of Haematology, School of Clinical and Laboratory Sciences, Royal Victoria Infirmary, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, UK.

However, reports of the frequency of My+ ALL in children vary widely across laboratories using different mAb clones and staining and analysing procedures. Taking two commonly accepted thresholds of positivity for myeloid antigens (20 and 30%), we analysed the immunoreactivity of the most widely employed mAb clones against CD13 (SJ1D1, L138 and My7) and CD33 (My9, P67.6 and D3HL60) and compared the proportions of My+ ALL detected by these clones in childhood ALL. The correlation between myeloid antigen expression and the presence of the t(12;21) translocation was analysed concomitantly in the same samples. The percentage of ALL cases positive for myeloid markers varied significantly depending on the mAb clone and the positive threshold. Among patients with B-ALL, the proportion of CD13+ ALL was significantly lower using SJ1D1 than using L138 or My7, while the proportion of CD33+ ALL was significantly higher for My9 than for P67.6 or D3HL60. Analysis of the co-expression of CD13 and CD33 on B-ALL cells using combinations of mAb clones showed that this frequency was either underestimated by the SJ1D1/D3HL60 or overestimated by the L138/P67.6 and My7/My9 combinations. A correlation between CD13/CD33 positivity and the t(12;21) translocation was uniformly observed in B-ALL patients for a positive threshold of 30%, whereas SJ1D1/D3HL60 detected no correlation between t(12;21) and CD13/CD33 positivity when the threshold was lowered to 20%. These data show that the mAb clones commonly used to detect the CD13 and CD33 surface antigens have variable immunoreactivity against childhood ALL cells, which may partly explain the conflicting reports concerning the prognostic significance of myeloid antigen expression in paediatric ALL and its association with different translocations. The present findings may also be of clinical importance for therapeutic choices.","['Firat, H', 'Favier, R', 'Adam, M', 'Leverger, G', 'Landman-Parker, J', 'Cayre, Y', 'Douay, L']","['Firat H', 'Favier R', 'Adam M', 'Leverger G', 'Landman-Parker J', 'Cayre Y', 'Douay L']","[""Service d'Hematologie Biologique, Hjpital d'enfants Armand Trousseau, Paris, France.""]",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Duplicate Publication', 'Journal Article', 'Retracted Publication']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (CD33 protein, human)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3)', '0 (TEL-AML1 fusion protein)', 'EC 3.4.11.2 (CD13 Antigens)']",IM,"['*Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, CD/analysis/immunology', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/analysis/immunology', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'CD13 Antigens/analysis/immunology', 'Child', 'Clone Cells/immunology/pathology', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'Humans', 'Myeloid Cells/*immunology/pathology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/genetics/immunology', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3']",2001/11/08 10:00,2002/09/18 10:01,['2001/11/08 10:00'],"['2001/11/08 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/18 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/08 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428190109099329 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2001 Aug;42(4):675-82. doi: 10.3109/10428190109099329.,,,,,,,,,,,['Leuk Lymphoma. 2016 Jul;57(7):1746.

EMD was present at diagnosis in 12 (36%) of the 33 children with MDS. Three patients with juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) and 2 patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) presented with pleural effusion. Pericardial effusion was present in 3 of these patients, two of whom also had thrombosis. Pyoderma gangrenosum, relapsing polychondritis were the initial findings in another two cases with JMML. Lymphadenopathy (n=1), gingival hypertrophy (n=2), orbital granulocytic sarcoma (n=1) and spinal mass (n=1) were the presenting findings in 5 patients with refractory anemia with excess of blasts in transformation. Since high-dose methylprednisolone (HDMP, 20-30 mg/kg/day) has been shown to induce differentiation and apoptosis of myeloid leukemic cells in children with different morphological subtypes of acute myeloid leukemia in vivo and in vitro, 25 children with de novo MDS were treated with combined HDMP and cytotoxic chemotherapy. Dramatic improvement of EMD and decrease in blast cells both in the peripheral blood and bone marrow were obtained following administration of short-course HDMP treatment alone as observed in children with AML. HDMP, combined with low-dose cytosine arabinoside and mitoxantrone were used for the remission induction. Remission was achieved in 8 (80%) of 10 children who presented with EMD and in 9 (60%) of 15 children without EMD. Long-term remission (>6 years) was obtained in 4 (two with JMML and two with CMML), three of whom presented with EMD. In conclusion EMD can be a presenting finding in childhood MDS as observed in adults. In addition, the beneficial effect of HDMP combined with more intensive chemotherapy should be explored as alternative therapy in children with MDS not suitable for bone marrow transplantation.","['Hicsonmez, G', 'Cetin, M', 'Yenicesu, I', 'Olcay, L', 'Koc, A', 'Aktas, D', 'Tuncbilek, E', 'Tuncer, M']","['Hicsonmez G', 'Cetin M', 'Yenicesu I', 'Olcay L', 'Koc A', 'Aktas D', 'Tuncbilek E', 'Tuncer M']","[""Department of Pediatric Hematology, Ihsan Dogramaci Children's Hospital, Hacettepe University, Ankara, Turkey.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents)', 'X4W7ZR7023 (Methylprednisolone)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Methylprednisolone/administration & dosage', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/diagnosis/*drug therapy/*pathology', 'Prospective Studies', 'Remission Induction', 'Sarcoma, Myeloid/diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Treatment Outcome']",2001/11/08 10:00,2002/09/18 10:01,['2001/11/08 10:00'],"['2001/11/08 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/18 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/08 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428190109099328 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2001 Aug;42(4):665-74. doi: 10.3109/10428190109099328.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Finally, no difference was detected with respect to CD23, CD79b, CD11c and CD5 number of molecules/per cell between typical and atypical B-CLL. Other clinico-biological features, such as surface membrane immunoglobulin density, percentage of CD79b and FMC7 expression, peripheral blood lymphocytosis, trisomy 12 and advanced clinical stages were also found to be more frequent in atypical B-CLL.

It is now clear that the mRNA isoforms VEGF121 and VEGF 165 are expressed by B-CLL cells. In addition, low cellular and high serum levels of VEGF correlated with a poor clinical outcome. Although these data do not as yet show that angiogenesis is essential for B-CLL, it may indeed be relevant in the leukemic process so characteristic of this diseases.","['Molica, S']",['Molica S'],"['Department Hematology/Oncology, Azienda Ospedaliera Pugliese-Ciaccio, Catanzaro, Italy. smolica@libero.it']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Endothelial Growth Factors)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (VEGFA protein, human)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow/*blood supply/pathology', 'Endothelial Growth Factors/blood/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/etiology/mortality/*pathology', 'Lymphokines/blood/genetics', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic/*physiopathology', 'Prognosis', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors']",2001/11/08 10:00,2002/09/18 10:01,['2001/11/08 10:00'],"['2001/11/08 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/18 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/08 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428190109099320 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2001 Aug;42(4):603-7. doi: 10.3109/10428190109099320.,,24,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The MLL gene is localized at chromosome 11q23, and is involved in almost all of the chromosomal translocations involving 11q23. Twenty-four fusion partner genes have been identified to date, and the N-terminus of MLL fuses in-frame to the partner genes in all cases. Some of the MLL fusion partner genes encode transcription factors; others encode small GTP binding protein interacting molecules or cytoplasmic proteins, the functions of which are presently unknown. As a result of the diverse features of the MLL fusion partners, the underlying mechanism for leukemogenesis remains obscure. We cloned the MLL fusion partner gene from leukemic cells from a therapy-related leukemia patient with t(3;11)(p21;q23) and designated the gene AF3p21. This patient had a long latency period (9 years) before developing secondary leukemia. The AF3p21 gene encodes a nuclear protein with a molecular mass of 80 kDa, and this protein has SH3 and proline-rich domains. Among MLL fusion partners identified to date, only AF10 and AF17 have a homo-oligomerization domain. AF3p21 also has a homo-oligomerization domain, which was revealed by using a mammalian two-hybrid system. These results suggest that one possible role of the MLL fusion partners is to form an oligomer of truncated MLL. In this review, current knowledge about MLL-involved leukemogenesis is outlined.","['Sano, K']",['Sano K'],"['Department of Pediatrics, Kobe University School of Medicine, Japan. sanoped@kobe-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (AF3p21-MLL fusion protein, human)', '0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Muscle Proteins)', '0 (NCKIPSD protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['*Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Animals', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 3', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Dimerization', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Biphenotypic, Acute/*etiology/genetics', '*Muscle Proteins', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', 'Nuclear Proteins/chemistry/*genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', '*Proto-Oncogenes', '*Transcription Factors', 'Translocation, Genetic']",2001/11/08 10:00,2002/09/18 10:01,['2001/11/08 10:00'],"['2001/11/08 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/18 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/08 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428190109099319 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2001 Aug;42(4):595-602. doi: 10.3109/10428190109099319.,,24,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In summarizing the results of these studies, we have distinguished between non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), chronic lymphatic leukemia (CLL) and plasmocytoma/ multiple myeloma (MM). A causal relationship between asbestos exposure and the subsequent development of lymphomas cannot be derived from the available results. However, since quite a number of studies and the combined analysis indicate a (weakly) increased risk, this question should be considered directly in future epidemiological studies. Such studies should address separately the various sub-entities, employing the latest internationally agreed classification, and should also use the latest methods of quantifying exposure.","['Becker, N', 'Berger, J', 'Bolm-Audorff, U']","['Becker N', 'Berger J', 'Bolm-Audorff U']","['Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum, Division of Clinical Epidemiology, Im Neuenheimer Feld 280, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Germany,Int Arch Occup Environ Health,International archives of occupational and environmental health,7512134,['1332-21-4 (Asbestos)'],IM,"['*Asbestos', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Causality', 'Cohort Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/epidemiology', 'Lymphoma/*epidemiology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/epidemiology', '*Occupational Exposure', 'Odds Ratio', 'Plasmacytoma/epidemiology']",2001/11/08 10:00,2002/01/25 10:01,['2001/11/08 10:00'],"['2001/11/08 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/25 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/08 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s004200100253 [doi]'],ppublish,Int Arch Occup Environ Health. 2001 Sep;74(7):459-69. doi: 10.1007/s004200100253.,,47,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, in the mice, liver changes included increased incidences of pigment in reticuloendothelial cells, centilobular hypertrophy, granulomatous inflammation, and a slightly increased incidence of necrosis (75 and 374 ppm). An increase in hepatocellular carcinomas occurred in male mice at 374 ppm. Additional MEKO-related findings in the rat included congestion of the spleen with pigment in reticuloendothelial cells and extramedullary hematopoiesis and a decreased incidence of lymphoreticular mononuclear cell leukemia. Effects observed in the liver of the rats included decreases in the incidence of both peribiliary fibrosis and hyperplasia/proliferation of the biliary duct, an increase of spongiosis hepatis in males, and an increase in the incidence of intracytoplasmic vacuoles and hepatocellular basophilic foci. The effects on the liver were generally most profound in the high-exposure groups and, with the exception of the spongiosis hepatis, occurred in both sexes. An increase in hepatocellular adenomas occurred in the male rats at 75 and 374 ppm, and hepatocellular carcinomas in the male rats at 374 ppm. In both species, the liver tumors appeared relatively late in the life of the animals, with no significant increase in tumors at 12 mo of exposure in mice and at 18 mo of exposure in rats. Lifespan shortening was not observed, as MEKO-exposed animals survived generally as well as, or slightly better than, the controls.","['Newton, P E', 'Wooding, W L', 'Bolte, H F', 'Derelanko, M J', 'Hardisty, J F', 'Rinehart, W E']","['Newton PE', 'Wooding WL', 'Bolte HF', 'Derelanko MJ', 'Hardisty JF', 'Rinehart WE']","['Pharmaco LSR, Inc., East Millstone, New Jersey, USA. paul.newton@mpiresearch.com']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Inhal Toxicol,Inhalation toxicology,8910739,"['0 (Butanones)', '0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (Oximes)', '96-29-7 (2-butanone oxime)']",IM,"['Administration, Inhalation', 'Animals', 'Atmosphere Exposure Chambers', 'Body Weight/drug effects', 'Brain/drug effects', 'Butanones/*toxicity', 'Carcinogenicity Tests', 'Carcinogens/*toxicity', 'Female', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Nasal Cavity/drug effects', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/chemically induced/pathology', 'Organ Size/drug effects', 'Oximes/*toxicity', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred F344', 'Survival Analysis']",2001/11/07 10:00,2002/01/15 10:01,['2001/11/07 10:00'],"['2001/11/07 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/15 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/07 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1080/08958370152647636 [doi]', 'F5LHG7CQT44RFKT6 [pii]']",ppublish,Inhal Toxicol. 2001 Dec;13(12):1093-116. doi: 10.1080/08958370152647636.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients with t(15;17) APL respond well to retinoic acid (RA) and other treatments, whereas those with t(11;17) APL do not. The PML-RAR alpha and PLZF-RAR alpha fusion oncoproteins function as aberrant transcriptional repressors, in part by recruiting nuclear receptor-transcriptional corepressors and histone deacetylases (HDACs). Transgenic mice harboring the RAR alpha fusion genes develop forms of leukemia that faithfully recapitulate both the clinical features and the response to RA observed in humans with the corresponding translocations. Here, we investigated the effects of HDAC inhibitors (HDACIs) in vitro and in these animal models. In cells from PLZF-RAR alpha/RAR alpha-PLZF transgenic mice and cells harboring t(15;17), HDACIs induced apoptosis and dramatic growth inhibition, effects that could be potentiated by RA. HDACIs also increased RA-induced differentiation. HDACIs, but not RA, induced accumulation of acetylated histones. Using microarray analysis, we identified genes induced by RA, HDACIs, or both together. In combination with RA, all HDACIs tested overcame the transcriptional repression exerted by the RAR alpha fusion oncoproteins. In vivo, HDACIs induced accumulation of acetylated histones in target organs. Strikingly, this combination of agents induced leukemia remission and prolonged survival, without apparent toxic side effects.","['He, L Z', 'Tolentino, T', 'Grayson, P', 'Zhong, S', 'Warrell, R P Jr', 'Rifkind, R A', 'Marks, P A', 'Richon, V M', 'Pandolfi, P P']","['He LZ', 'Tolentino T', 'Grayson P', 'Zhong S', 'Warrell RP Jr', 'Rifkind RA', 'Marks PA', 'Richon VM', 'Pandolfi PP']","['Molecular Biology Program and Department of Pathology, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, Sloan-Kettering Division, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Cornell University, New York, New York 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA071692/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-71692/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UO1 CA-84292/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA071692/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 CA084292/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-0974823/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (Phenylbutyrates)', '0 (RARA protein, human)', '0 (Rara protein, mouse)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '3X2S926L3Z (trichostatin A)', '58IFB293JI (Vorinostat)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'DNA, Complementary/metabolism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', '*Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/pharmacology', 'In Situ Nick-End Labeling', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Models, Chemical', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Phenylbutyrates/pharmacology', 'Protein Binding', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/genetics', '*Remission Induction', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha', 'Time Factors', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Up-Regulation', 'Vorinostat']",2001/11/07 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/11/07 10:00'],"['2001/11/07 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/07 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1172/JCI11537 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Invest. 2001 Nov;108(9):1321-30. doi: 10.1172/JCI11537.,,,,,PMC209432,['J Clin Invest. 2001 Nov;108(9):1277-8.

In the present study we have analyzed by flow cytometry immunophenotyping the TCR-Vbeta repertoire of 98 consecutive cases of persistent expansions of CD4(+) or CD8(+bright) CD3(+)/TCR-alphabeta(+) LGLs and compared the results with those obtained in molecular studies of TCR-beta gene rearrangements. Fifty-eight cases were considered to be monoclonal in molecular studies whereas in the remaining 40 cases there was no evidence for monoclonality (11 cases were considered oligoclonal and 29 polyclonal). The TCR-Vbeta repertoire was biased to the preferential use of one or more TCR-Vbeta families in 96% of cases, a total of 124 TCR-Vbeta expansions being diagnosed: one TCR-Vbeta expansion in 71 cases and two or more TCR-Vbeta expansions in 23 cases. The highest TCR-Vbeta expansion observed in each case was higher among monoclonal (74 +/- 19%) as compared to nonmonoclonal cases (24 +/- 14%) (P = 0.001), as did the fraction of LGLs that exhibited a TCR-Vbeta-restricted pattern (86 +/- 16% and 42 +/- 23%, respectively; P = 0.0001); by contrast, the proportion of cases displaying more than one TCR-Vbeta expansion was higher in the latter group: 7% versus 48%, respectively (P = 0.001). Results obtained in oligoclonal cases were intermediate between those obtained in polyclonal and monoclonal cases and similar results were observed for CD4(+) as for CD8(+bright) T-cell expansions. TCR-Vbeta families expressed in CD8(+bright) T-cell-LGL proliferations showed a pattern of distribution that mimics the frequency at which the individual TCR-Vbeta families are represented in normal peripheral blood T cells. Assuming that a given proliferation of LGLs is monoclonal whenever there is an expansion of a given TCR-Vbeta family of at least 40% of the total CD4(+) or CD8(+bright) T-cell compartment, we were able to predict clonality with a sensitivity of 93% and a specificity of 80%. By increasing the cut-off value to 60%, sensitivity and specificity were of 81% and 100%. In summary, our results suggest that flow cytometry immunophenotypic analysis of the TCR-Vbeta repertoire is a powerful screening tool for the assessment of T-cell clonality in persistent expansions of TCR-alphabeta(+) LGLs.","['Lima, M', 'Almeida, J', 'Santos, A H', 'dos Anjos Teixeira, M', 'Alguero, M C', 'Queiros, M L', 'Balanzategui, A', 'Justica, B', 'Gonzalez, M', 'San Miguel, J F', 'Orfao, A']","['Lima M', 'Almeida J', 'Santos AH', 'dos Anjos Teixeira M', 'Alguero MC', 'Queiros ML', 'Balanzategui A', 'Justica B', 'Gonzalez M', 'San Miguel JF', 'Orfao A']","['Servico de Hematologia Clinica, Unidade de Citometria, Hospital Geral de Santo Antonio, Porto, Portugal. mmc.lima@clix.pt']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Pathol,The American journal of pathology,0370502,"['0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'CD3 Complex/*analysis', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/physiology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/physiology', 'Child', 'Clone Cells', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Experimental/etiology/*immunology/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/*genetics', 'Reference Values', 'T-Lymphocytes/pathology/*physiology']",2001/11/07 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/11/07 10:00'],"['2001/11/07 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/07 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0002-9440(10)63032-5 [pii]', '10.1016/s0002-9440(10)63032-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Pathol. 2001 Nov;159(5):1861-8. doi: 10.1016/s0002-9440(10)63032-5.,,,,,PMC1867049,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To elucidate the influence of NII formation on intranuclear substructures, we investigated the relationship of NIIs with nuclear bodies in brains of dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy and Machado-Joseph disease. In both diseases, promyelocytic leukemia protein, a major component of the promyelocytic leukemia protein nuclear bodies, altered the normal distribution and was rearranged around NII, forming a single capsular structure. We further demonstrated that NIIs were present in close contact with coiled bodies, a highly dynamic domain that may be involved in the biogenesis of small nuclear ribonucleoproteins. The preferential association of intranuclear polyglutamine aggregates with coiled bodies was also confirmed in the dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy transgenic mouse brain and culture cells expressing mutant atrophin-1.

Currently, BLV is known to infect B cells, whereas its ability to infect other cell types, e.g. monocytes/macrophages, is doubtful. As monocytes/macrophages may have profound effects on the diversity of the T-cell response, we studied the possibility of in vitro infection, using bovine monocytes and SV40-transformed bovine macrophages. Proviral DNA was detected by nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from day 1 until the end of the experiments at either day 5 or day 80, depending on the quantity of virus used for infection. In addition, the infection was associated with morphological changes in infected cells as revealed by electron microscopy. The in vitro infection did not significantly change either the expression of surface antigens (CD11b, CD32, and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II) or the amounts of cytokine transcripts (interleukin (IL)-1beta, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, IL-6 and IL-12p40) with or without lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation.

There were 67 men and 36 women in the study, ranging in age from 2 to 94 years (mean: 61 years). The incidence of pancreatic secondary tumors was 15% in the autopsy cases of malignant tumors, and the majority of the secondary tumors were carcinomas. The stomach was the most common primary tumor site (20%), followed by the lung (18%) and extrahepatic bile duct (13%). Because the total number of each primary carcinoma differed, we paid specific attention to the incidence of pancreatic metastasis in each primary carcinoma. We found that carcinoma of the papilla of Vater showed the highest rate of incidence (75%) of pancreatic metastasis in each type of primary carcinoma. Approximately half of the metastatic lesions were solitary, but the metastatic lesions in the pancreas could not be identified macroscopically in 34 cases (33%). Histologically, the most common carcinoma was adenocarcinoma, followed by large cell carcinoma, small cell carcinoma and neuroendocrine carcinoma. The most common non-epithelial tumor was leukemia, followed by malignant lymphoma. Undifferentiated carcinoma and neuroendocrine carcinoma were often found in cases of extrahepatic bile duct or urinary bladder carcinoma with pancreatic metastasis. As for the microscopic infiltration patterns of tumor cells, 73% of cases showed an interlobular and intralobular infiltration.

DISCUSSION: Although asymptomatic, ocular localizations are frequent in leucemia. Their prognostic impact depends on the ocular structure involved and on the chronology of onset--early or late in the leucemia course. The underlying pathophysiological mechanism of ocular involvement remains unexplained but hyperleucocytosis at presentation may be a risk factor and would justify at least systematic specialized examinations and discussion of prophylactic treatment.","['Le Gall, S', 'Francois, S', 'Urier, N', 'Genevieve, F', ""d'Hermies, F"", 'Rachieru, P', 'Ifrah, N']","['Le Gall S', 'Francois S', 'Urier N', 'Genevieve F', ""d'Hermies F"", 'Rachieru P', 'Ifrah N']","[""Service d'Hematologie, CHU Angers, Paris.""]",['fre'],,"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",France,Presse Med,"Presse medicale (Paris, France : 1983)",8302490,,IM,"['Adult', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/*complications', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/complications', 'Retinal Neoplasms/*complications', 'Vision, Low/*etiology']",2001/11/07 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/11/07 10:00'],"['2001/11/07 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/07 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Presse Med. 2001 Oct 13;30(29):1450-2.,,,,Localisation sous-retinienne inaugurale d'une rechute de leucemie aigue myeloblastique (LAM5).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because the mortality rate was not higher in the period immediately after treatment began, a definition of the period covered by the term ""immediate"" is somewhat arbitrary rather than ""biologic,"" as might be the case if the early weeks were distinguished by a particularly high mortality rate. M.D. Anderson researchers have focused on the treatment complications and deaths occurring in the first 4 weeks after the beginning of induction therapy. In the first week, infection contributed to 71% of the deaths and pulmonary hemorrhage associated with diffuse alveolar damage contributed to 44%; the incidence of infection rose while the incidence of hemorrhage decreased during weeks 2 to 4. The associations between 4-week mortality rates with age, performance status, and white blood cell (WBC) count are well known. Study data suggest that elevated pretreatment levels of uric acid and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) levels are similarly associated with 4-week mortality. The prognostic significance of hyperuricemia appears independent of WBC, creatinine, and TNF-alpha. M.D. Anderson investigators have studied the roles of pheresis, TNF-alpha receptor-blocking agents, continuous venovenous dialysis, and newer antifungal agents in reducing early mortality. In particular, data from a retrospective M.D. Anderson analysis of pheresis (146 patients with WBC > 50,000 +/- microL) suggest that the value of this procedure is questionable. Preliminary data also point to the potential value of the TNF-alpha alpha receptor blocker etanercept (Enbrel, Immunex Corp, Seattle, WA) in patients at high risk of early death. Data from a randomized M.D. Anderson trial suggest that oral fluconazole plus itraconazole capsules are equivalent to liposomal amphotericin in antifungal prophylaxis. Because neither alternative appears satisfactory, researchers at M.D. Anderson are examining the role of intravenous itraconazole, which produces higher concentrations than itraconazole capsules in prophylaxis, and the role of FK 463 in treatment of fungal infections.","['Estey, E']",['Estey E'],"['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Semin Hematol,Seminars in hematology,0404514,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '268B43MJ25 (Uric Acid)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers/blood', 'Cause of Death', 'Humans', 'Infections/drug therapy/etiology/mortality', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*complications/*mortality/therapy', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/metabolism', 'Uric Acid/blood']",2001/11/06 10:00,2002/03/22 10:01,['2001/11/06 10:00'],"['2001/11/06 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/22 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/06 10:00 [entrez]']","['ashem0384d0032 [pii]', '10.1016/s0037-1963(01)90042-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Semin Hematol. 2001 Oct;38(4 Suppl 10):32-7. doi: 10.1016/s0037-1963(01)90042-3.,['Copyright 2001 by W.B.

Manifestations of these diseases in both adults and children include a propensity for abdominal and CNS involvement and a high incidence of metabolic abnormalities due to rapid cell growth and turnover, which are acutely exacerbated by treatment. Numerous studies show that FAB L-3, Burkitt's lymphoma (BL), and SNC are among the most curable of the multiple leukemia/lymphoma subtypes if treated appropriately. At least 50% of adults with these disorders are cured with the use of short-term intensive chemotherapeutic regimens, with treatment failure a consequence of both drug resistance and an inability of older adults to tolerate the side effects of therapy. Published studies have included very heterogeneous groups of patients, some characterized only by morphology, and others studied with cytogenetics but not necessarily having the classic mutations involving c-myc.

In a phase III trial, children with newly diagnosed ALL or stage III/IV NHL were stratified and randomized to receive recombinant urate oxidase or allopurinol. Results showed that the 27 patients who received recombinant urate oxidase had a significantly lower plasma uric acid concentration and a more rapid decline in serum creatinine level than did the 25 who took allopurinol. One patient in the recombinant urate oxidase group had hemolysis of unknown cause, and one in the allopurinol group required hemofiltration for hyperphosphatemia. To further assess the safety profile of recombinant urate oxidase, the data on 245 patients (173 children and 72 adults) who received this agent in a compassionate-use program were reviewed retrospectively. The drug produced dramatic decreases in uric acid concentrations in all patients. Nine patients (four children and five adults) had mild adverse reactions that were drug-related or of unknown etiology. These data suggest that recombinant urate oxidase is safe and effective in the prophylaxis and treatment of hyperuricemia associated with malignancy or chemotherapy.","['Pui, C H']",['Pui CH'],"[""St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, and Department of Pediatrics, University of Tennessee, College of Medicine, Memphis, TN 38105, USA.""]",['eng'],"['CA21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA36401/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA51001/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA58297/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA78224/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Semin Hematol,Seminars in hematology,0404514,"['268B43MJ25 (Uric Acid)', '63CZ7GJN5I (Allopurinol)', 'EC 1.7.3.3 (Urate Oxidase)']",IM,"['Allopurinol/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/blood/complications/drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Therapeutic Equivalency', 'Tumor Lysis Syndrome/drug therapy/prevention & control', 'United States', 'Urate Oxidase/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/toxicity', 'Uric Acid/*blood']",2001/11/06 10:00,2002/03/22 10:01,['2001/11/06 10:00'],"['2001/11/06 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/22 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/06 10:00 [entrez]']","['ashem0384d0013 [pii]', '10.1016/s0037-1963(01)90039-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Semin Hematol. 2001 Oct;38(4 Suppl 10):13-21. doi: 10.1016/s0037-1963(01)90039-3.,['Copyright 2001 by W.B.

A retrospective study was performed to evaluate the frequency of metabolic complications and dialysis in 410 patients with B-cell stage III and IV NHL and L-3 ALL treated in France according to the LMB89 protocol, and to compare these results to those of other series of patients treated without urate oxidase. Of the 57 patients treated at Institut Gustave-Roussy, only five had metabolic complications occurring in the first cycle of chemotherapy. Two patients (3.5%) underwent dialysis: one because of oliguria, the second for preventive reasons. In all the other cases, metabolic problems were successfully resolved or prevented, using nonrecombinant urate oxidase (Uricozyme, Sanofi-Sythelabo, Inc, Paris, France) in combination with hyperhydration. Nonrecombinant urate oxidase is generally well tolerated. However, allergic reactions may occur, with rates varying from 0% to 4.5%. In addition, the extraction technology used to produce the product is limited by a low yield. A recombinant form of urate oxidase (rasburicase) was therefore developed. European clinical development results indicate that this agent produces a sharp and consistent decrease in uric acid levels in patients undergoing cytoreductive therapy. Additionally, there is a very low incidence of anaphylaxis. Studies have demonstrated the efficacy of urate oxidase in lowering uric acid levels, preventing hyperuricemia after the initiation of cytoreductive therapy, and preserving renal function in patients with B-cell advanced stage NHL and ALL.","['Patte, C', 'Sakiroglu, O', 'Sommelet, D']","['Patte C', 'Sakiroglu O', 'Sommelet D']","['Pediatric Oncology Department, Institut Gustave-Roussy, Villejuif, France.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Semin Hematol,Seminars in hematology,0404514,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '268B43MJ25 (Uric Acid)', 'EC 1.7.3.3 (Urate Oxidase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects/toxicity', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Europe', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/blood/complications/drug therapy', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/blood/complications/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tumor Lysis Syndrome/drug therapy/etiology/prevention & control', 'Urate Oxidase/therapeutic use', 'Uric Acid/*blood']",2001/11/06 10:00,2002/03/22 10:01,['2001/11/06 10:00'],"['2001/11/06 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/22 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/06 10:00 [entrez]']","['ashem0384d0009 [pii]', '10.1016/s0037-1963(01)90038-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Semin Hematol. 2001 Oct;38(4 Suppl 10):9-12. doi: 10.1016/s0037-1963(01)90038-1.,['Copyright 2001 by W.B.

Their severity and incidence may be reduced with procedures based on the prevention and elimination of sources causing oral infection and irritation. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this investigation was to evaluate the effectiveness of an Oral Disease Preventive Protocol in children with cancer, subjected to chemotherapy and prior to application of dentobacterial infection control. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A controlled clinical test was run, with random assignations, on twelve 5-to-12-year-old patients diagnosed with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) or Lymphoma, evaluated for twelve months, with a total of 154 evaluations. Five patients were boosted with oral physiotherapy, with non-alcoholic 0.05% fluoride mouthwashes, with topical application of myconazole oral gel; seven patients were given instructions on oral physiotherapy. RESULTS: There were no significant differences between the groups under evaluation (p>0.05). Of the oral complications evaluated, gingivitis registered the highest percentage (60%), followed by mucositis (18%) and candida albicans infection (7%). Most affected were the submandibular and cervical ganglions (59% and 41%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Prior control of sources causing oral infection and irritation effectively prevents complications during non-surgical cancer therapy.","['Rojas de Morales, T', 'Zambrano, O', 'Rivera, L', 'Navas, R', 'Chaparro, N', 'Bernardonni, C', 'Rivera, F', 'Fonseca, N', 'Tirado, D M']","['Rojas de Morales T', 'Zambrano O', 'Rivera L', 'Navas R', 'Chaparro N', 'Bernardonni C', 'Rivera F', 'Fonseca N', 'Tirado DM']","['Universidad del Zulia, Facultad de Odontologia Instituto de investigaciones, Maracaivo (Venezuela). jmorales@iamnet.com']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",Spain,Med Oral,Medicina oral : organo oficial de la Sociedad Espanola de Medicina Oral y de la Academia Iberoamericana de Patologia y Medicina Bucal,9815821,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Clinical Protocols', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mouth Diseases/*chemically induced/*prevention & control']",2001/11/06 10:00,2002/08/01 10:01,['2001/11/06 10:00'],"['2001/11/06 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/01 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/06 10:00 [entrez]']",['10488600 [pii]'],ppublish,Med Oral. 2001 Nov-Dec;6(5):326-34.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Especially in cases with involvement of the central nervous system (CNS) treatment is difficult because the efficacy of most chemotherapeutic agents as well as EBV-specific cytotoxic donor T cells in liquor is uncertain. In the last years the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody Rituximab was intensively investigated in the treatment of EBV-PTLD. However, only 8 patients with B-cell lymphoma and CNS involvement treated with Rituximab were reported. CASE REPORT: A 24-year-old female patient with acute T-lymphoblastic leukemia in second complete remission had received allogeneic, unrelated, T-cell depleted HSCT. 10 months later an EBV-associated PTLD was diagnosed. Beside peripheral lymphomas and B symptoms the patient showed neurological symptoms. Examination of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) revealed a meningeosis lymphoblastica caused by the EBV lymphoma. Treatment with Rituximab and the antiviral drug Cidofovir led to complete remission with regression of the peripheral lymphomas and disappearance of the neurological symptoms. In addition, the PCR control on EBV DNA became negative in the plasma as well as in CSF. CONCLUSION: The combination of Rituximab and Cidofovir appears as an interesting alternative treatment in patients with EBV-associated PTLD and CNS involvement.","['Hanel, M', 'Fiedler, F', 'Thorns, C']","['Hanel M', 'Fiedler F', 'Thorns C']","['Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik I, Universitatsklinikum Carl Gustav Carus, TU Dresden, Germany. haenel@onco-center.de']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Switzerland,Onkologie,Onkologie,7808556,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Organophosphonates)', '0 (Organophosphorus Compounds)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', '8J337D1HZY (Cytosine)', 'JIL713Q00N (Cidofovir)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived', 'B-Lymphocytes/pathology', 'Cidofovir', 'Cytosine/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Epstein-Barr Virus Infections/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/therapy', 'Lymph Nodes/pathology', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/*drug therapy/pathology', '*Meninges', '*Organophosphonates', 'Organophosphorus Compounds/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Prognosis', 'Rituximab']",2001/11/06 10:00,2002/01/23 10:01,['2001/11/06 10:00'],"['2001/11/06 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/23 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/06 10:00 [entrez]']","['55132 [pii]', '10.1159/000055132 [doi]']",ppublish,Onkologie. 2001 Oct;24(5):491-4. doi: 10.1159/000055132.,"['Copyright 2001 S.

Immunological evaluation by flow cytometry (FC) is one of the most attractive approaches to this. The present review summarizes the historical development of the technique over the last 20 years, showing that current methodology is based on the existence of leukemia-associated patterns of asynchrony in antigen expression with respect to normal differentiation or location of occurrence. Such asynchrony allows the sensitive detection of rare malignant cells by multiparametric FC, although completely leukemia-specific antigens for broad application do not exist. Clinical studies proved that the technology should now be applicable to almost all patients with ALL and that immunological MRD results correlate well with outcome. However, based on the available set of FC data, it is yet too early to draw firm conclusions for clinical application. Issues still to be addressed by comprehensive and non-selecting investigations on the basis of the most widely used treatment protocols are whether 1) quantitative data generated by PCR and FC are interchangeable, 2) differences between therapeutic regimens influence the significance of qualitative and quantitative aspects of MRD, and 3) absolute enumeration of MRD bears advantages over the common practice of relative quantification. Concluding remarks further relate to technical issues which may allow to simplify the approach in the future which should augment also its economic efficiency.","['Dworzak, M N']",['Dworzak MN'],"['Forschungsinstitut fur krebskranke Kinder, St. Anna Kinderspital, Wien, Austria.

However, it is not clear whether it should be used immediatly after failure of chlorambucil (CLB). We addressed such an issue retrospectively analyzing a series of patients in whom FAMP was used as third-line therapy after a sequential use of CLB and CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone) or CHOP-like regimen, respectively. DESIGN AND METHODS: On a retrospective basis, 57 B-CLL patients fulfilling the above mentioned criteria and followed-up in seven different hematologic institutions, were evaluated. RESULTS: Of 57 patients who were evaluated for response, 3 (5.2%) achieved a complete response (CR), 30 (52.6%) had a partial response (PR) and the remaining 24 (42.1%) failed to respond to FAMP. Overall median survival from the start of FAMP therapy was 30 months. Survival by tumor response did not show any difference between responders and non-responders (p = 0.536). The survival was significantly shorter in the group of patients with progressive disease than in all other patients included in our study (p = 0.05). Using each patient as his own control (McNemar test) we attempted to evaluate the value of FAMP in inducing a therapeutic response after failure of previous therapies. Among the 37 patients resistant to CLB the response rate was 40.3% with FAMP (p = 0.037) and only 17.5% with CHOP (p = 1.0). Among 35 patients resistant to a CHOP-like regimen, the response rate was 29.8% (p = 0.066) after FAMP therapy. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: From our results, it seems that FAMP works better than a CHOP-like regimen in patients resistant to CLB although results do not translate into a survival advantage for responders.","['Liso, V', 'Molica, S', 'Capalbo, S', 'Pogliani, E', 'Battista, C', 'Broccia, G', 'Montillo, M', 'Cuneo, A', 'Leoni, P', 'Specchia, G', 'Castoldi, G']","['Liso V', 'Molica S', 'Capalbo S', 'Pogliani E', 'Battista C', 'Broccia G', 'Montillo M', 'Cuneo A', 'Leoni P', 'Specchia G', 'Castoldi G']","['Institute of Hematology, University of Bari, Italy. ematba@cimedoc.uniba.it']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['18D0SL7309 (Chlorambucil)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'CHOP protocol']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Chlorambucil/*administration & dosage', 'Cyclophosphamide/*administration & dosage', 'Doxorubicin/*administration & dosage', 'Drug Resistance', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prednisone/*administration & dosage', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vidarabine/*administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives', 'Vincristine/*administration & dosage']",2001/11/06 10:00,2002/07/18 10:01,['2001/11/06 10:00'],"['2001/11/06 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/07/18 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/06 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 2001 Nov;86(11):1165-71.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the initial causes of MCRs and the molecular mechanisms involved are largely unresolved. Nor are the karyotypic patterns well studied, mainly because of the difficulties of obtaining complete karyotypes by G-banding. In this study, we applied spectral karyotyping (SKY) and comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) to investigate further the resulting chromosome imbalances and rearrangements in AML and MDS bone marrow cells with MCRs. DESIGN AND METHODS: Bone marrow cells from 12 AML and 10 MDS patients with MCRs were collected at diagnosis and analyzed by G-banding, SKY and CGH. The patients' characteristics were also collected to pinpoint potential similarities and/or differences between the patients. RESULTS: Our results show that some MCRs seen in AML are similar to MCRs seen in MDS. These MCRs often result in chromosome loss of 5q, 7q and 17p and gain of chromosome 8. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: The characteristics associated with MRCs include old age, previous exposure to radio- and/or chemotherapy and a short survival time. Probably, these patients should be distinguished from AML patients with primary chromosome rearrangements among other unbalanced chromosome rearrangements.

Arsenic, a possibly essential ultratrace element for humans, has been used in the treatment of leukemia. Anticancer effects of selenium and arsenic have been related to their ability to induce apoptosis. Because humans are exposed to diverse trace elements simultaneously, it is important to learn their interrelationship. In this study, we demonstrate that sodium selenite (Na2SeO3) causes apoptosis at 3 microM and necrosis at high concentrations (> 3 microM) in HL-60 cells. Similarly, both sodium arsenite (NaAsO2) at 50 microM and sodium arsenate (Na2HAsO4) induce apoptosis at 500 microM and necrosis at higher concentrations (> 50 microM and > 500 microM, respectively) in HL-60 cells. Arsenite/arsenate, but not selenite, enhances AP-1 DNA-binding activity. This finding indicates different mechanisms through which apoptosis is induced by these two elements. Interestingly, we observed that HL-60 cell necrosis induced by a high concentration (> 3 microM) of selenite was essentially inhibited by arsenic (50 microM of NaAsO2 or 500 microM of Na2HAsO4), which resulted in a net effect of apoptosis. Because AP-1 DNA-binding activity was not induced in the presence of a combination of necrotic amount of selenite and apoptotic amount of arsenite/arsenate, the observed apoptosis apparently was through the mechanism used by selenite. Our results suggest, for the first time, that the toxic necrotic effect of selenite can be neutralized by arsenite/arsenate at the cellular level.","['Zeng, H']",['Zeng H'],"['United States Department of Agriculture, Grand Forks Human Nutrition Research Center, ND 58202-9034, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Biol Trace Elem Res,Biological trace element research,7911509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cations)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Heat Shock Transcription Factors)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-1)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'HIW548RQ3W (Sodium Selenite)', 'N712M78A8G (Arsenic)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Arsenic/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Cations/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Drug Interactions', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Heat Shock Transcription Factors', 'Humans', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'NF-kappa B/genetics', 'Necrosis', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Sodium Selenite/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Transcription Factor AP-1/genetics', 'Transcription Factors']",2001/11/06 10:00,2002/04/16 10:01,['2001/11/06 10:00'],"['2000/12/20 00:00 [received]', '2001/01/17 00:00 [revised]', '2001/02/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2001/11/06 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/04/16 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/06 10:00 [entrez]']","['BTER:83:1:01 [pii]', '10.1385/BTER:83:1:01 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Trace Elem Res. 2001 Oct;83(1):1-15. doi: 10.1385/BTER:83:1:01.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To analyze for BR and its metabolites, livers of Wistar and mutant TR- rats were perfused with BR in a single pass system. In bile, native BR and its deamination product, benzene carboxylic acid riboside (BR-COOH) was quantified by HPLC. Total excretion of BR and BR-COOH into bile of Wistar rats was low (< 0.2%) whereas cumulative efflux of BR and its metabolite BR-COOH was high, representing 79% and 1.6% of infused BR, respectively. Biliary excretion of BR and BR-COOH in TR- rats, deficient in canalicular multispecific organic anion transporter, a membrane protein identical to MRP2 in tumor cells, was only slightly lower than in Wistar rats, indicating that BR and BR-COOH are non-substrates of MRP2. Experiments using rat hepatocytes incubated with BR did show a linear uptake of BR and a subsequent metabolism to BR-COOH that was largely excreted into the cellular supernatant. Examination of the cytotoxic activity against the human HL60 and K562 leukemia cells in a clonogenic assay demonstrated an IC50 of 619 microM and 1013 microM for BR-COOH compared to the IC50 of 0.21 microM and 0.46 microM for BR, suggesting the inertness of the metabolite.

The median age of patients was 51 years (range 19-79 years), with slight predominance of women (female to male ratio 1.2:1). The evaluated group involved all patients with AML diagnosis, treated by intensive induction chemotherapy in the Department of Hematology-oncology, University Hospital, Olomouc during last 4 years with assessable cytogenetic results. Chromosomal changes were found in 63 (60%) patients. The most often affected chromosomes in succession of frequency were 8, 17, 7, 5, 11, 15, 16 a 21. Based on found specific and frequent chromosomal changes the patients were divided into 3 prognostic subgroups and the significance of chromosomal aberrations was evaluated. The subgroup of 17 patients with good prognosis consisted of a patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia with translocation t(15;17), 4 patients with t(8;21) and 4 patients with inv(16). 14 patients of 17 live in complete remission, median of overall survival (OS) is 63 weeks. The subgroup of intermediate prognosis was formed by 60 patients, 42 had normal karyotype and 18 patients had other chromosomal abnormalities. Median OS of this group was 35 weeks. The third subgroup with poor prognosis consisted of 28 patients with changes of chromosomes 3, 5, 7, 11 and complex karyotype. 64.3% of patients received complete remission and median OS was 35 weeks.

Complete haematological remission was achieved in 13 patients (41.9%) in the arm with idarubicine and 15 patients (51.7%) in the arm with mitoxantrone. The medians of overall survival time (OS) and disease free survival time (DFS) were 22 and 44 weeks in the idarubicine arm and 35 and 40 weeks in the mitoxantrone arm, respectively. Statistical analysis did not prove any significant difference in the complete remission rates, in the number of deaths during cytopenia, in the OS or DFS, in the duration of hospitalisation, severe neutropenia and thrombopenia, in the number of days with febrile neutropenia, or in the consumption of platelets and erythrocytes transfusion units between both arms. Despite the fact that these results are not statistically significant in favour of any treatment arm, which is probably influenced also by the small number of evaluated patients, more favourable results were achieved in the arm with mithoxantrone with the respect to the evaluated parameters. From the point of view of cost-effectiveness, the difference could be observed when considering the price of both intercalating cytostatics. The use of mitoxantrone (Refador, Lachema) is 15x times cheaper per course of treatment than the use of idarubicine (Zavedos, Pharmacia). Autologous peripheral blood stem cells transplantation (APBSC) was carried out only in 4 patients younger than 60. No one of them was cured by APBSC but the median of OS of these patients was longer than the median in the other patients of the group. The results achieved are comparable with those of other trials conducted by various foreign groups.

In group 2 there was a higher transplantation mortality after day 100 associated with a more frequent chronic GVHD (0% vs. 16.5%).

The authors did not observe a substantial effect of changes in the basic supportive treatment on results of transplantation. Late transplantation mortality associated in particular with a higher incidence of chronic GVHD could be in the authors' opinion reduced by longer administration of immunosuppression after transplantation, in particular in older patients.","['Karas, M', 'Cerna, K', 'Koza, V', 'Jindra, P', 'Vozobulova, V', 'Schutzova, M']","['Karas M', 'Cerna K', 'Koza V', 'Jindra P', 'Vozobulova V', 'Schutzova M']","['Hematologicko-onkologicke oddeleni Fakultni nemocnice, Plzen.']",['cze'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Czech Republic,Vnitr Lek,Vnitrni lekarstvi,0413602,,IM,"['Adult', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects/mortality', 'Graft Survival', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*therapy', 'Living Donors', 'Middle Aged']",2001/11/06 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/11/06 10:00'],"['2001/11/06 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/06 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Vnitr Lek. 2001 Sep;47 Suppl 1:34-9.,,,,Alogenni transplantace kostni drene u pacientu s chronickou myeloidni leukemii v obdobi 1991-1995 a 1996-1998.

Many different signal transduction pathways are activated by Bcr-Abl, but little is known about their downstream targets in specific cell lineages. We show here that Ph-positive cell lines as well as primary cells derived from chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in lymphoid blast crisis or from acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) consistently express high levels of cyclin D2, whereas expression of this protein is low or absent in comparable Ph-negative lines and Ph-positive myeloid lines. Inhibition of Bcr-Abl with STI571 resulted in down-regulation of cyclin D2 and reduction of the number of cells in S phase, although complete G1 arrest was not induced. The expression of cyclin D2 in Ph-positive lymphoblasts was mediated via the phosphatidyl-inositol-3 kinase pathway. Analogous results were seen in murine BaF/3 cells transfected with a BCR-ABL expression vector. In contrast to the human cell lines, murine Baf/BCR-ABL cells exposed to STI571 inhibitor were all arrested in G1. This arrest could be abrogated by exogenous expression of cyclin D2 from a transfected cDNA construct. We conclude that a direct connection exists between Bcr-Abl PTK activity and cell cycle progression in which cyclin D2 plays a critical role. However, cell cycle progression in human Ph-positive lymphoid cells is not entirely dependent on Bcr-Abl PTK, and additional genetic lesions must be present.","['Deininger, M W', 'Vieira, S A', 'Parada, Y', 'Banerji, L', 'Lam, E W', 'Peters, G', 'Mahon, F X', 'Kohler, T', 'Goldman, J M', 'Melo, J V']","['Deininger MW', 'Vieira SA', 'Parada Y', 'Banerji L', 'Lam EW', 'Peters G', 'Mahon FX', 'Kohler T', 'Goldman JM', 'Melo JV']","['Department of Haematology, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College of Science, Technology and Medicine, Hammersmith Hospital, London W12 0NN, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (CCND2 protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin D2)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Benzamides', 'Blast Crisis', 'Cyclin D2', 'Cyclins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Down-Regulation', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'G1 Phase/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/enzymology/genetics/*metabolism', 'Lymphocytes/enzymology/*metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/physiology', 'Piperazines', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/enzymology/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'S Phase/drug effects', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transfection']",2001/11/03 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/11/03 10:00'],"['2001/11/03 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/03 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 2001 Nov 1;61(21):8005-13.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The murine colorectal carcinoma CT26 and melanoma B16 have recently been found to express the endogenous retroviral gene products gp70 and p15E, respectively, that can serve as antigens recognized by T cells. To date, though, there has been no demonstration of tumor treatment using an endogenous retroviral protein. In this study, we demonstrate that mice immunized with recombinant vaccinia encoding the gp70 H2-L(d)-restricted minimal determinant were protected from CT26 tumor challenge. Splenocytes from mice immunized with vaccinia gp70 specifically secreted IFN-gamma in response to gp70 peptide-pulsed stimulators. Although this strategy could protect against subsequent tumor challenge, it was ineffective against established tumors. Therefore, to investigate the treatment of established CT26 or B16 lung metastases, mice were treated with cultured dendritic cells (DCs) pulsed with gp70 or p15E peptide. Significant inhibition of established lung metastases required immunization with peptide-pulsed DCs pretreated with CD40 ligand that has been demonstrated to increase the T-cell stimulatory activity of DCs.

It is also useful for the isolation of tumor antigens recognized by T cells. We applied this method to identify melanoma antigens recognized by the serum from a patient with a good prognosis who had T-cell-infiltrated melanoma and vitiligo. By screening a lambda phage cDNA library constructed from a highly pigmented melanoma cell line, SKmel23, with the patient's serum, 50 positive cDNA clones consisting of 26 distinct antigens were isolated. Of these, 20 encoded known proteins, and 6 encoded previously uncharacterized ones. The most frequently isolated clone, which we named KU-MEL-1, was unknown previously but was homologous to partial cDNA sequences registered in the expressed sequence tag database. Reverse transcription-PCR and Northern blot analysis demonstrated that KU-MEL-1 was strongly expressed in most melanoma cell lines, melanoma tissue samples, and cultured melanocytes and weakly expressed in cell lines derived from other types of tumors, as well as in some normal tissues, including testis. Western blot analysis with polyclonal murine antibody generated by immunization with the recombinant KU-MEL-1 protein demonstrated that the KU-MEL-1 protein was preferentially expressed in melanoma cells and melanocytes. IgG antibodies against KU-MEL-1 were detected in the sera from 9 of 26 melanoma patients and from some patients with other cancers, including brain tumor, esophageal cancer, colon cancer, and chronic myelogenous leukemia, but were not detected in sera from 30 healthy individuals. Although the IgG specific for KU-MEL-1 was not detected in sera from 12 vitiligo patients, it was detected in sera from 7 of 11 patients with Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease that is thought to be an autoimmune disease against melanocytes.

We have previously demonstrated that cytotoxic lectin-II isolated from Korean mistletoe induces apoptotic cell death in the human monoblastic leukemia cell line, U937, via the activation of the stress-activated protein kinases/c-Jun N-terminal kinase (SAPK/JNK). In the present study, the roles of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK1/2) and p38 MAPK in lectin-II-induced apoptosis have been investigated. Treatment of U937 cells with lectin-II resulted in apoptotic DNA fragmentation, which was preceded by the activation of ERK1/2, p38 MAPK and SAPK/JNK. This lectin-II-induced DNA fragmentation was significantly enhanced when ERK1/2 activation was selectively inhibited by PD098059. 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, which stimulates ERK activity in U937 cells, markedly reduced lectin-II-induced DNA fragmentation. Inhibition of p38 MAPK activity with p38-specific inhibitor, SB203580, partially inhibited lectin-II-induced DNA fragmentation. These results suggest that ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK may have opposite effects on cell survival in response to cytotoxic mistletoe lectin-II, which may contribute to the modulation of lectin-II-mediated cytotoxic activity.","['Pae, H O', 'Oh, G S', 'Kim, N Y', 'Shin, M K', 'Lee, H S', 'Yun, Y G', 'Oh, H', 'Kim, Y M', 'Chung, H T']","['Pae HO', 'Oh GS', 'Kim NY', 'Shin MK', 'Lee HS', 'Yun YG', 'Oh H', 'Kim YM', 'Chung HT']","['Medicinal Resources Research Center, Wonkwang University, Iksan, Chonbug 570-749, South Korea.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,In Vitr Mol Toxicol,In vitro & molecular toxicology,9808800,"['0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Plant Preparations)', '0 (Plant Proteins)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (Ribosome Inactivating Proteins, Type 2)', '0 (Toxins, Biological)', '0 (ribosome inactivating protein, Viscum)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'OU13V1EYWQ (SB 203580)', 'SJE1IO5E3I (2-(2-amino-3-methoxyphenyl)-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects/physiology', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Flavonoids/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/pharmacology', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/metabolism', '*Mistletoe', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/drug effects/*metabolism', '*Plant Preparations', '*Plant Proteins', 'Pyridines/pharmacology', 'Ribosome Inactivating Proteins, Type 2', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Toxins, Biological/*pharmacology', 'U937 Cells/metabolism', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases']",2001/11/03 10:00,2002/02/06 10:01,['2001/11/03 10:00'],"['2001/11/03 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/02/06 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/03 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/10979330152560496 [doi]'],ppublish,In Vitr Mol Toxicol. 2001 Summer;14(2):99-106. doi: 10.1089/10979330152560496.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This process is, in part, regulated by the bcl-2 oncogene. Antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) targeted to specific oncogenes have been used with some therapeutic success in animal models of leukemia and melanoma cells and human Hodgkin's lymphoma. We evaluated the effects of antisense ODNs targeted to the bcl-2 oncogene on the proliferation of human renal-cell carcinoma (RCC) cells in vitro and on the growth of human RCC xenografts in BALBc nude (nu/nu) mice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Expression bcl-2 mRNA in five RCC cell lines (ACHN, Caki-1, RCZ, RCW, and OS-RC-2) was analyzed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. The effects of phosphorothioated ODNs containing human bcl-2 sense and bcl-2 antisense sequences that were transfected with Lipofectin on the proliferation and viability of cultures of established human RCC cell lines were determined by MTS assay. The expression of Bcl-2 protein in ACHN tumor cells following antisense bcl-2 (AS2) ODN treatment was evaluated by Western blot analysis, and the extent of apoptosis in these cells was determined by fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis. The antitumor activity in ACHN xenografts in nu/nu mice was monitored by measuring differences in tumor weight in treated and control mice. RESULTS: Expression of bcl-2 mRNA was detected in all five RCC lines. Treatment with antisense bcl-2 ODNs inhibited the growth of all tested RCC cells and decreased Bcl-2 protein expression in ACHN cells. The AS2 antisense ODN complementary to the coding region of bcl-2 mRNA showed a superior antiproliferative effect compared with AS1 ODN complementary to the translation initiation region. Inhibition by antisense bcl-2 ODNs of ACHN cells was dose dependent. The FACS analysis revealed that growth inhibition was associated with the induction of programmed cell death. In vivo, AS2 ODN antitumor activity was noted in locally injected groups. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of human RCC with antisense ODNs targeted to bcl-2 inhibits growth and is associated with the induction of programmed cell death. These results suggest therapeutic use of antisense bcl2 in the treatment of RCC.","['Uchida, T', 'Gao, J P', 'Wang, C', 'Satoh, T', 'Itoh, I', 'Muramoto, M', 'Hyodo, T', 'Irie, A', 'Akahoshi, T', 'Jiang, S X', 'Kameya, T', 'Baba, S']","['Uchida T', 'Gao JP', 'Wang C', 'Satoh T', 'Itoh I', 'Muramoto M', 'Hyodo T', 'Irie A', 'Akahoshi T', 'Jiang SX', 'Kameya T', 'Baba S']","['Department of Urology, Kitasato University School of Medicine, Sagamihara, Kanagawa, Japan. tuchida@med.kitasato-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Urol,Molecular urology,9709255,"['0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Thionucleotides)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/physiology', 'Carcinoma, Renal Cell/pathology/*therapy', 'Cell Division/physiology', 'Cell Separation', 'Cell Transplantation', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Genes, bcl-2', 'Genetic Therapy', 'Humans', 'Kidney Neoplasms/pathology/*therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides, Antisense/genetics/*therapeutic use', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/metabolism', 'Thionucleotides/genetics/*therapeutic use', 'Transfection', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/11/03 10:00,2002/02/16 10:01,['2001/11/03 10:00'],"['2001/11/03 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/02/16 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/03 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/109153601300177583 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Urol. 2001 Summer;5(2):71-8. doi: 10.1089/109153601300177583.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Through this property, striking parallels can be found between stem cells and cancer cells: tumours may often originate from the transformation of normal stem cells, similar signalling pathways may regulate self-renewal in stem cells and cancer cells, and cancer cells may include 'cancer stem cells' - rare cells with indefinite potential for self-renewal that drive tumorigenesis.","['Reya, T', 'Morrison, S J', 'Clarke, M F', 'Weissman, I L']","['Reya T', 'Morrison SJ', 'Clarke MF', 'Weissman IL']","['Departments of Pathology and Developmental Biology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Palo Alto, California 94305, USA. irv@stanford.edu']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Nature,Nature,0410462,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/pathology', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Regeneration', 'Signal Transduction', '*Stem Cells']",2001/11/02 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/11/02 10:00'],"['2001/11/02 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/02 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/35102167 [doi]', '35102167 [pii]']",ppublish,Nature. 2001 Nov 1;414(6859):105-11. doi: 10.1038/35102167.,,85,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methylation also plays an important role in the silencing of exogenous retroviruses. One of the difficulties inherent in the study of proviral silencing is that the sites in which proviruses randomly integrate influence the probability of de novo methylation and expression. In order to compare methylated and unmethylated proviruses at the same genomic site, we used a recombinase-based targeting approach to introduce an in vitro methylated or unmethylated Moloney murine leukemia-based provirus in MEL cells. The methylated and unmethylated states are maintained in vivo, with the exception of the initially methylated proviral enhancer, which becomes demethylated in vivo. Although the enhancer is unmethylated and remodeled, the methylated provirus is transcriptionally silent. To further analyze the repressed state, histone acetylation status was determined by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analyses, which revealed that localized histone H3 but not histone H4 hyperacetylation is inversely correlated with proviral methylation density. Since members of the methyl-CpG binding domain (MBD) family of proteins recruit histone deacetylase activity, these proteins may play a role in proviral repression. Interestingly, only MBD3 and MeCP2 are expressed in MEL cells. ChIPs with antibodies specific for these proteins revealed that only MeCP2 associates with the provirus in a methylation-dependent manner. Taken together, our results suggest that MeCP2 recruitment to a methylated provirus is sufficient for transcriptional silencing, despite the presence of a remodeled enhancer.","['Lorincz, M C', 'Schubeler, D', 'Groudine, M']","['Lorincz MC', 'Schubeler D', 'Groudine M']","['Division of Basic Sciences, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington 98109, USA.']",['eng'],"['DK44746/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'GM 19767/01/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 DK044746/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'F32 GM019767/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'HL57620/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Mecp2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Methyl-CpG-Binding Protein 2)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Cre recombinase)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Integrases)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Binding Sites/genetics', 'Cell Line', '*Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone', 'Clone Cells/metabolism', 'CpG Islands/physiology', '*DNA Methylation', 'DNA, Viral/genetics/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Endogenous Retroviruses/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Silencing/*physiology', 'Gene Targeting', 'Histone Deacetylases/metabolism', 'Histones/*metabolism', 'Integrases/metabolism', 'Methyl-CpG-Binding Protein 2', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics/metabolism', 'Proviruses/genetics/*metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Viral Proteins/metabolism']",2001/11/02 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/11/02 10:00'],"['2001/11/02 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/02 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/MCB.21.23.7913-7922.2001 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2001 Dec;21(23):7913-22. doi: 10.1128/MCB.21.23.7913-7922.2001.,,,,,PMC99960,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PCR amplification and sequence analyses of DNA flanking integrated proviruses revealed proviral insertion into the N-ras/unr (upstream of N-ras) locus in 2 out of 13 B-cell lymphomas, both of which appeared clonal by Southern blotting analysis. These two tumors showed increased expression levels of N-ras by Northern blotting, as did a third tumor shown by reverse transcriptase PCR to have a nonclonal provirus integration located in the same area. However, no significant changes in expression were observed when using a specific probe for the unr gene. All proviruses were integrated in the same transcriptional orientation as unr and N-ras genes. By promoter insertion, the two Akv1-99 proviruses integrated between exon -1 and exon 1 of N-ras gave rise to two different spliced products, whereas the provirus integrated into unr used only an exon skipping pattern. The absence of mutations of the N-ras codons 12, 13, 18, and 61 suggests that activation of the proto-oncogene is exclusively due to overexpression by retroviral promoter insertion, and furthermore, Northern blot analyses indicate that the expression of unr is unaffected by N-ras overexpression even in the case where the unr gene itself is the target of proviral insertion. Thus, altogether our findings indicate that overexpression of N-ras plays a role in development of murine leukemia virus-induced B-cell lymphomas, leaving the expression of the tightly linked unr gene unaltered.","['Martin-Hernandez, J', 'Sorensen, A B', 'Pedersen, F S']","['Martin-Hernandez J', 'Sorensen AB', 'Pedersen FS']","['Department of Molecular and Structural Biology, University of Aarhus, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (CSDE1 protein, human)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Northern', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Genes, Viral', '*Genes, ras', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Point Mutation', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proviruses/*genetics', 'RNA Splicing', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/physiology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2001/11/02 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/11/02 10:00'],"['2001/11/02 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/02 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.75.23.11907-11912.2001 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2001 Dec;75(23):11907-12. doi: 10.1128/JVI.75.23.11907-11912.2001.,,,,,PMC114780,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

GFP-SU assembled into virions and showed a strong association with the transmembrane protein (TM). However, these virions were noninfectious. GFP-SU expression was not maintained within cells, suggesting that the protein was toxic. Addition of the second-site mutations rendered the GFP-SU virus infectious and resulted in prolonged expression of the modified envelope protein. This virus showed a slight reduction in receptor binding but not in envelope protein processing, suggesting that addition of the GFP sequences results in subtle structural changes. Extrapolating these data, we see that the fundamental problem with the GFP-SU envelope protein appears to be a folding problem, suggesting that the second-site mutations rescue GFP-SU primarily by a mechanism that involves stabilizing the envelope protein structure.","['Kizhatil, K', 'Gromley, A', 'Albritton, L M']","['Kizhatil K', 'Gromley A', 'Albritton LM']","['Department of Molecular Sciences, University of Tennessee Health Sciences Center, Memphis, Tennessee 38163, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 AI033410/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI33410/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Glycoproteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics/metabolism/*pathogenicity', '*Point Mutation', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Virulence']",2001/11/02 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/11/02 10:00'],"['2001/11/02 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/02 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.75.23.11881-11885.2001 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2001 Dec;75(23):11881-5. doi: 10.1128/JVI.75.23.11881-11885.2001.,,,,,PMC114775,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We constructed a large pool of insertion mutations in the env gene and analyzed the fitness of each mutant in completing two critical steps in the virus life cycle: (i) the expression and delivery of the Env protein to the cell surface during virion assembly and (ii) the infectivity of virions displaying the mutant proteins. The majority of the mutants were poorly expressed at the producer cell surface, suggesting folding defects due to the presence of the inserted residues. The mutants with residual infectivity had insertions either in the amino-terminal signal sequence region, two disulfide-bonded loops in the receptor binding domain, discrete regions of the carboxy-terminal region of the surface subunit (SU), or the cytoplasmic tail. Insertions that allowed the mutants to reach the cell surface but not to mediate detectable infection were located within the amino-terminal sequence of the mature Env, within the SU carboxy-terminal region, near putative receptor binding residues, and throughout the fusion peptide. Independent analysis of select mutants in this group allowed more precise identification of the defect in Env function. Mapping of mutant phenotypes to a structural model of the receptor-binding domain provides insights into the protein's functional organization.

Primary rat alveolar epithelial cells (AEC) grown on plastic or as polarized monolayers on tissue culture-treated polycarbonate semipermeable supports were transduced with a replication-defective human immunodeficiency virus-based lentivirus vector pseudotyped with the vesicular stomatitis virus G (VSV-G) protein and encoding an enhanced green fluorescent protein reporter gene. Transduction efficiency, evaluated by confocal microscopy and quantified by fluorescence-activated cell sorting, was dependent on the dose of vector, ranging from 4% at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1 to 99% at an MOI of 50 for AEC grown on plastic. At a comparable titer and MOI, transduction of these cells by a similarly pseudotyped murine leukemia virus vector was approximately 30-fold less than by the lentivirus vector. Importantly, comparison of lentivirus-mediated gene transfer from the apical or basolateral surface of confluent AEC monolayers (R(t) > 2 kOmega. cm(2); MOI = 10) revealed efficient transduction only when VSV-G-pseudotyped lentivirus was applied apically. Furthermore, treatment with EGTA to increase access to the basolateral surface did not increase transduction of apically applied virus, indicating that transduction was primarily via the apical membrane domain. In contrast, differentiated tracheal epithelial cells were transduced by apically applied lentivirus only in the presence of EGTA and at a much lower overall efficiency (approximately 15-fold) than was observed for AEC. Efficient transduction of AEC from the apical cell surface supports the feasibility of using VSV-G-pseudotyped lentivirus vectors for gene transfer to the alveolar epithelium and suggests that differences exist between upper and lower airways in the polarity of available receptors for the VSV-G protein.","['Borok, Z', 'Harboe-Schmidt, J E', 'Brody, S L', 'You, Y', 'Zhou, B', 'Li, X', 'Cannon, P M', 'Kim, K J', 'Crandall, E D', 'Kasahara, N']","['Borok Z', 'Harboe-Schmidt JE', 'Brody SL', 'You Y', 'Zhou B', 'Li X', 'Cannon PM', 'Kim KJ', 'Crandall ED', 'Kasahara N']","['Department of Medicine and Will Rogers Institute Pulmonary Research Center, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California 90033, USA. zborok@hsc.usc.edu']",['eng'],"['R01 HL063988/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL 64365/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL038578/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL62576/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL38578/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL038621/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL038658/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL38621/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL 38658/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'AR46366/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL064365/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (G protein, vesicular stomatitis virus)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Cell Line', 'Epithelial Cells/virology', '*Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'Lentivirus/*genetics', 'Male', '*Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Pulmonary Alveoli/cytology/*virology', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', '*Transduction, Genetic', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*genetics']",2001/11/02 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/11/02 10:00'],"['2001/11/02 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/02 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.75.23.11747-11754.2001 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2001 Dec;75(23):11747-54. doi: 10.1128/JVI.75.23.11747-11754.2001.,,,,,PMC114760,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) the promoter-proximal poly(A) site is blocked by interaction of U1 snRNP with the closely positioned major splice donor site (MSD) 200 nucleotides downstream. Here we investigated whether the same mechanism applies to down-regulate 5' LTR polyadenylation in Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMLV). Although the same molecular architecture is present in both viruses, the MoMLV poly(A) signal in the 5' LTR is active whether or not the MSD is mutated. This surprising difference between the two retroviruses is not due to their actual poly(A) signals or MSD sequences, since exchange of either element between the two viral sequences does not alter their ability to regulate 5' LTR poly(A) site use. Instead we demonstrate that sequence between the cap and AAUAAA is required for MSD-dependent poly(A) regulation in HIV-1, indicating a key role for this part of the LTR in poly(A) site suppression. We also show that the MoMLV poly(A) signal is an intrinsically weak RNA-processing signal. This suggests that in the absence of a poly(A) site suppression mechanism, MoMLV is forced to use a weak poly(A) signal.","['Furger, A', 'Monks, J', 'Proudfoot, N J']","['Furger A', 'Monks J', 'Proudfoot NJ']","['Sir William Dunn School of Pathology, Oxford University, Oxford OX1 3RE, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '24937-83-5 (Poly A)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA Primers', 'HIV-1/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Poly A/*metabolism', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid']",2001/11/02 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/11/02 10:00'],"['2001/11/02 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/02 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.75.23.11735-11746.2001 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2001 Dec;75(23):11735-46. doi: 10.1128/JVI.75.23.11735-11746.2001.,,,,,PMC114759,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, these models do not completely reproduce human diseases partly because HTLV-1 replicates poorly in rats. We investigated here the possible reason for this. We found that the activity of Rex in rat cells is quite low compared to that in human cells. As Rex function depends largely on the CRM1 protein, whose human type (human CRM1 [hCRM1]) directly binds to Rex and exports it from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, we assessed whether rat CRM1 (rCRM1) could act as well as hCRM1 as a cofactor for Rex activity. We first cloned a cDNA encoding rCRM1 and found that both rCRM1 and hCRM1 could bind to and export Rex protein to the cytoplasm with similar efficiencies. However, unlike hCRM1, rCRM1 could hardly support Rex function because of its poor ability in inducing the Rex-Rex interaction required for RNA export into the cytoplasm. These observations suggest that the poor ability of rCRM1 to act as a cofactor for Rex function may be responsible for the poor replication of HTLV-1 in rats.","['Hakata, Y', 'Yamada, M', 'Shida, H']","['Hakata Y', 'Yamada M', 'Shida H']","['Institute for Virus Research, Kyoto University, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto 606-8507, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Gene Products, rex)', '0 (Karyopherins)', '0 (Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (exportin 1 protein)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA Primers', 'Gene Products, rex/chemistry/genetics/*physiology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Karyopherins/*physiology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Transport', 'Rats', '*Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear', 'Recombinant Proteins/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Virus Replication/physiology']",2001/11/02 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/11/02 10:00'],"['2001/11/02 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/02 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.75.23.11515-11525.2001 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2001 Dec;75(23):11515-25. doi: 10.1128/JVI.75.23.11515-11525.2001.,,,,,PMC114738,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We previously reported that the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 IN protein is required for efficient viral DNA synthesis and that this function requires specific interaction with other viral components but not enzyme (integration) activity. In this report, we characterized the structure and function of the Moloney murine leukemia virus (MLV) IN protein in viral DNA synthesis. Using an MLV vector containing green fluorescent protein as a sensitive reporter for virus infection, we found that mutations in either the catalytic triad (D184A) or the HHCC motif (H61A) reduced infectivity by approximately 1,000-fold. Mutations that deleted the entire IN (DeltaIN) or 34 C-terminal amino acid residues (Delta34) were more severely defective, with infectivity levels consistently reduced by 10,000-fold. Immunoblot analysis indicated that these mutants were similar to wild-type MLV with respect to virion production and proteolytic processing of the Gag and Pol precursor proteins. Using semiquantitative PCR to analyze viral cDNA synthesis in infected cells, we found the Delta34 and DeltaIN mutants to be markedly impaired while the D184A and H61A mutants synthesized cDNA at levels similar to the wild type. The DNA synthesis defect was rescued by complementing the Delta34 and DeltaIN mutants in trans with either wild-type IN or the D184A mutant IN, provided as a Gag-IN fusion protein. However, the DNA synthesis defect of DeltaIN mutant virions could not be complemented with the Delta34 IN mutant. Taken together, these analyses strongly suggested that the MLV IN protein itself is required for efficient viral DNA synthesis and that this function may be conserved among other retroviruses.","['Lai, L', 'Liu, H', 'Wu, X', 'Kappes, J C']","['Lai L', 'Liu H', 'Wu X', 'Kappes JC']","['Department of Medicine, University of Alabama at Birmingham, 35294, USA.']",['eng'],"['P30 AI027767/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI47714/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA73470/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI047714/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'P30-AI-27767/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Integrases)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA Replication/*physiology', 'DNA, Viral/*biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Integrases/*physiology', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*enzymology/*genetics/pathogenicity', 'Mutation', 'Virion/genetics']",2001/11/02 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/11/02 10:00'],"['2001/11/02 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/02 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.75.23.11365-11372.2001 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2001 Dec;75(23):11365-72. doi: 10.1128/JVI.75.23.11365-11372.2001.,,,,,PMC114722,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The frequencies of correct targeting, transfer-associated errors, mismatch extension, and transfer before reaching the end of the donor template were determined. All four molecular events occurred, with their proportions varying depending on the nature of acceptor/transferring DNA complementarity. When complementarity was severely limited, recombination was inefficient and most products resulted from aberrant second-strand transfer rather than from forced template switching between RNAs. Other classes of reverse transcription products, including some that resulted from template switching between virus and host sequences, were also observed when homology between the acceptor and donor was limited.","['Pfeiffer, J K', 'Telesnitsky, A']","['Pfeiffer JK', 'Telesnitsky A']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109-0620, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (RNA, Viral)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Base Pair Mismatch', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA, Viral/genetics', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics/*physiology', 'RNA, Viral/genetics', '*Recombination, Genetic', '*Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Templates, Genetic', 'Transcription, Genetic', '*Virus Replication']",2001/11/02 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/11/02 10:00'],"['2001/11/02 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/02 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.75.23.11263-11274.2001 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2001 Dec;75(23):11263-74. doi: 10.1128/JVI.75.23.11263-11274.2001.,,,,,PMC114711,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, the mechanisms by which ceramide interferes with this pathway were examined in Jurkat leukemia and MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Both exogenous and endogenous ceramide inhibited selectively PKC-mediated activation of NF-kappaB by reverting PKC translocation to the membrane. Next, confocal and immunofluorescence studies were performed to evaluate the direct effects of ceramide on PKC. These studies showed that ceramide inhibited translocation of a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-PKCbeta2 fusion protein in response to PMA. A mutant PKC in which autophosphorylation sites were mutated to alanine (PKC-DA) was resistant to ceramide. A kinase-inactive mutant (PKC-KR) was also resistant to ceramide action, and the results were supported using kinase inhibitors of the enzyme. Finally, overexpression of PKC-DA prevented, at least partly, the ability of ceramide to inhibit activation of NF-kappaB. Taken together, these studies show that ceramide has acute effects on translocation of PKC by inducing reverse translocation, and this reversal requires both the kinase activity of PKC and phosphorylation of the autophosphorylation sites.","['Signorelli, P', 'Luberto, C', 'Hannun, Y A']","['Signorelli P', 'Luberto C', 'Hannun YA']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology; Medical University of South Carolina; Charleston, South Carolina 29425, USA.']",['eng'],"['GM-43825/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-43707/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,FASEB J,FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology,8804484,"['0 (Ceramides)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 3.1.4.12 (Sphingomyelin Phosphodiesterase)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Biological Transport/drug effects', 'Ceramides/*pharmacology', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/genetics/metabolism', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Luminescent Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'NF-kappa B/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Protein Kinase C/genetics/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sphingomyelin Phosphodiesterase/pharmacology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/11/02 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/11/02 10:00'],"['2001/11/02 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/02 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1096/fj.01-0244com [doi]', '15/13/2401 [pii]']",ppublish,FASEB J. 2001 Nov;15(13):2401-14. doi: 10.1096/fj.01-0244com.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Four derivatives were tested as inhibitors of cell proliferation with twelve human leukemia cell lines and demonstrated powerful antiproliferative activities, with 3-hydroxystaurosporine being the most potent. IC(50) values were determined using the cell line MONO-MAC-6 and with an IC(50) of 13 ng/ml, 3-hydroxystaurosporine turned out to be one of the most active staurosporine-type inhibitors described so far. All derivatives, except 3-hydroxy-3'-demethoxy-3'-hydroxystaurosporine and 4'-N-methylstaurosporine very strongly reduced RNA and DNA synthesis with 3-hydroxystaurosporine again being the strongest inhibitor. Analysis of structure-activity relationships demonstrated that hydroxylation of staurosporine at position 3 of the indolocarbazole moiety caused an increase in anti-proliferative activity, while hydroxylation at carbon 11 resulted in a decrease in activity. Our results suggest that not only the presence or absence of hydrophilic substitutions, but also the position of the alteration within the molecule, is important in the antiproliferative properties of the various staurosporine analogues.","['Schupp, P', 'Steube, K', 'Meyer, C', 'Proksch, P']","['Schupp P', 'Steube K', 'Meyer C', 'Proksch P']","['Center for Marine Biofouling and Bio-Innovation, University of New South Wales, Sydney, 2052, Australia. p.schupp@unsw.edu.au']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Ireland,Cancer Lett,Cancer letters,7600053,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'DNA Replication/drug effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/chemistry/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Molecular Structure', 'Platyhelminths/*chemistry', 'Staurosporine/chemistry/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*drug effects/pathology', 'Urochordata/*chemistry']",2001/11/02 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/11/02 10:00'],"['2001/11/02 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/02 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0304383501006942 [pii]', '10.1016/s0304-3835(01)00694-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Lett. 2001 Dec 28;174(2):165-72. doi: 10.1016/s0304-3835(01)00694-2.,,,['Cancer Lett. 2003 Feb 10;190(1):119'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We examined the effect of MRK-16, a monoclonal antibody against P-gp, modified liposomes (MRK-Lip) on the human myelogenous leukemia K-562 cells and its adriamycin resistance cell line K-562/ADM cells to avoid the side effects and to reverse the multidrug resistance. The uptake of vincristine (VCR) by K-562/ADM cells was lower than that by K-562 cells. This low uptake was increased in the presence of verapamil and MRK-16, however, it was not increased in the presence of control antibody, IgG2A. The binding of MRK-Lip to K-562/ADM cells was higher than that of IgG2A-modified liposome (IgG-Lip) and liposome without modification (Cont-Lip). Moreover, the cytotoxicity of VCR-encapsulated MRK-Lip to K-562/ADM cells was higher than that of VCR-encapsulated IgG-Lip and Cont-Lip. These results suggest that the interaction between liposomes and multidrug resistance cells was increased by the modification of liposomes with MRK-16. Consequently, the usefulness of MRK-Lip in cancer chemotherapy as a potent carrier was suggested.","['Matsuo, H', 'Wakasugi, M', 'Takanaga, H', 'Ohtani, H', 'Naito, M', 'Tsuruo, T', 'Sawada, Y']","['Matsuo H', 'Wakasugi M', 'Takanaga H', 'Ohtani H', 'Naito M', 'Tsuruo T', 'Sawada Y']","['Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kyushu University, 3-1-1 Maidashi, Higashi-ku, Fukuoka 812-8582, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Netherlands,J Control Release,Journal of controlled release : official journal of the Controlled Release Society,8607908,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Liposomes)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Liposomes/*administration & dosage', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vincristine/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology']",2001/11/02 10:00,2002/01/10 10:01,['2001/11/02 10:00'],"['2001/11/02 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/10 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/02 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0168365901004606 [pii]', '10.1016/s0168-3659(01)00460-6 [doi]']",ppublish,J Control Release. 2001 Nov 9;77(1-2):77-86. doi: 10.1016/s0168-3659(01)00460-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Taken together, our data suggest that VES induces activation of PKC and PKC-dependent hypophosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein, which results in induction of apoptosis, and that VES-induced early activation of ERK and ERK-dependent induction of p21(WAF1) are not required for apoptosis.","['Bang, O S', 'Park, J H', 'Kang, S S']","['Bang OS', 'Park JH', 'Kang SS']","['Department of Biology, College of Natural Sciences, Kyungpook National University, Taegu, 702-701, Korea.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Lamin Type B)', '0 (Lamins)', '0 (Maleimides)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '1406-18-4 (Vitamin E)', '67526-95-8 (Thapsigargin)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (PRKCA protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C-alpha)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'L79H6N0V6C (bisindolylmaleimide I)', 'R0ZB2556P8 (Tocopherols)', 'SJE1IO5E3I (2-(2-amino-3-methoxyphenyl)-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Membrane/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cell Nucleus/drug effects', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'Cyclins/metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Flavonoids/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Indoles/pharmacology', 'Isoenzymes/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Lamin Type B', 'Lamins', 'Maleimides/pharmacology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase C/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Protein Kinase C-alpha', 'Protein Transport/drug effects', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/metabolism', 'Thapsigargin/pharmacology', 'Tocopherols', 'U937 Cells', 'Vitamin E/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'fas Receptor/metabolism']",2001/11/02 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/11/02 10:00'],"['2001/11/02 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/02 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1006/bbrc.2001.5839 [doi]', 'S0006-291X(01)95839-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2001 Nov 9;288(4):789-97. doi: 10.1006/bbrc.2001.5839.,['Copyright 2001 Academic Press.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite its low aggressivity, histologic progression has been described in sporadic reports, although the frequency, characteristics, and underlying molecular abnormalities of this phenomenon are largely unknown. We review here the clinical, morphologic, immunohistochemical, and molecular features of a series of 12 SMZL cases that showed progression to large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL). The most frequent location of secondary LBCL was in peripheral lymph node. This occurred between 12 and 85 months after diagnosis of SMZL. However, in two cases LBCL was diagnosed at the initial stage of the disease (one spleen tumoral nodule and one hilar lymph node). The histologic and immunophenotypic features of these cases were similar to those of transformed LBCL at other sites. In four cases the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene polymerase chain study revealed the same rearrangement pattern in both primary and secondary tumors, thereby confirming their identity and excluding the possibility of a second malignancy. As is the case with other low-grade lymphoproliferative disorders, SMZL may undergo high-grade transformation. These 12 cases represent 13% of our series of SMZL with adequate follow-up. The incidence of large cell transformation in SMZL seems to be lower than in follicular lymphoma (25-60%) and mantle cell lymphoma (11-39%), although it is similar to the frequency of transformation in B-chronic lymphocytic lymphoma/small lymphocytic lymphoma (1-10%). The mean proliferative index (MIB1 staining) in initial SMZL specimens of cases with LBCL transformation was 28.6%, higher than that of MIB1 staining in the overall SMZL series (21.8%), although not statistically significantly so. p53 or p16INK4a inactivation in this series was observed in only one case, in contrast with the situation observed in chronic lymphocytic leukemia, follicular lymphoma, and mantle cell lymphoma. It seems that progression in SMZL is mainly independent of p53 or p16INK4a inactivation. The frequency of the 7q deletion in this series was 3 of 7 (42%). 7q loss may play an alternative role in the inactivation of the p53 and p16INK4a pathway, thereby favoring tumoral progression.","['Camacho, F I', 'Mollejo, M', 'Mateo, M S', 'Algara, P', 'Navas, C', 'Hernandez, J M', 'Santoja, C', 'Sole, F', 'Sanchez-Beato, M', 'Piris, M A']","['Camacho FI', 'Mollejo M', 'Mateo MS', 'Algara P', 'Navas C', 'Hernandez JM', 'Santoja C', 'Sole F', 'Sanchez-Beato M', 'Piris MA']","['Molecular Pathology Program, Fundacion Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Oncologicas Carlos III-CNIO, Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Surg Pathol,The American journal of surgical pathology,7707904,"['0 (Antigens, Nuclear)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-6)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Alleles', 'Antigens, Nuclear', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16/analysis/genetics', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/analysis/genetics', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/chemistry/genetics/mortality/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/chemistry/genetics/mortality/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nuclear Proteins/analysis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/analysis/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-6', 'Splenic Neoplasms/chemistry/genetics/mortality/*pathology', 'Survival Rate', 'Transcription Factors/analysis/genetics', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/analysis/genetics']",2001/11/02 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/11/02 10:00'],"['2001/11/02 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/02 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00000478-200110000-00007 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Surg Pathol. 2001 Oct;25(10):1268-76. doi: 10.1097/00000478-200110000-00007.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An example of a disease requiring costly treatment is acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML). To relate cost to benefit we calculated expenditure per life years gained. To assess costs we determined the real cost of treatment up to total remission, followed by consolidation or withdrawal of treatment or death. For survival time exceeding the 2-year observation period we used data from recent literature. The average cost of treatment ranges up to 107,592 Swiss francs (CHF). In 1997 we treated 23 leukaemia patients at Zurich University Hospital and gained a total of 210 life years. This represents an average cost of CHF 11,741 per life year gained. Chief cost items were therapy and personnel costs for nursing staff, followed by hotel business and personnel costs for doctors and diagnosis. Our results for AML treatment are far removed from the $61,500 ranging up to $166,000 discussed in the literature as the ""critical"" QALY (quality adjusted life years) value. This is the first time the actual costs of AML therapy have been shown for a Swiss cohort.

In our search for this gene, we identified a candidate, 5qNCA (LOC51780), which lies within a consistently-deleted segment of 5q31. 5qNCA expresses a 7.2-kb transcript with a 5286-bp open reading frame which is present at high levels in heart, skeletal muscle, kidney, placenta, and liver as well as CD34+ cells and AML cell lines. 5qNCA encodes a 191-kD nuclear protein which contains a highly-conserved C-terminus containing a zinc finger with the unique spacing Cys-X2-Cys-X7-His-X2-Cys-X2-Cys-X4-Cys-X2-Cys and a jmjC domain, which is often found in proteins that regulate chromatin remodeling. Expression of 5qNCA in a del(5q) cell line results in suppression of clonogenic growth. Preliminary sequence results in AML and MDS samples and cell lines has revealed a possible mutation in the KG-1 cell line resulting in a THR to ALA substitution that has not been found in over 100 normal alleles to date.

TGF beta 1 arrested cells in G1 phase and significantly downregulated the expression of cyclin D2, cyclin D3, cdk4, cyclin A, and cdk2. The downregulation of the molecules resulted in approximately 50-90% decrease of the molecule-dependent kinase activity, varying with each molecule. Although treatment of cells with TGF beta 1 up-regulated accumulation of p27(kip1) in both nucleus and cytoplasm, the association of the p27(kip1) with cdk2, cyclin A, cyclin D2, cyclin D3, and cdk4 was markedly down-regulated, suggesting that p27(kip1) is not responsible for the downregulation of the kinase activity. In contrast, TGF beta 1 upregulated cyclin E-associated p27(kip1) with no effect on the expression of cyclin E. p27(kip1)-immunodepletion upregulated cyclin E-dependent kinase activity by more than 10-fold in TGF beta 1-treated cells but not in proliferating cells; whereas immunodepletion of p27(kip1) from cdk2-immunoprecipitates markedly downregulated cdk2 kinase activity in the lysates extracted from both proliferating and TGF beta-treated cells.

We have developed an in vitro flow model to study the functional consequences of the radiation-induced upregulation of E-selectin and intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM-1). METHODS: Human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HDMEC), human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), or transformed human microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC-1) were grown in 35-mm dishes and irradiated with a single dose of 10 Gy. HL-60 (human promyelocytic leukemia) cells were perfused over the irradiated endothelial cells in a parallel plate flow chamber at shear stress ranging from 0.5 to 2.0 dynes/cm2. Flow cytometry was used to quantify the expression of E-selectin and ICAM-1 on the various endothelial cells. RESULTS: Flow cytomeric analysis revealed an upregulation of ICAM-1 expression on all three cell types postirradiation (post-IR), and an upregulation of E-selectin expression only on HDMEC post-IR. E-selectin expression was detected on control HDMEC, but at a lower level than that detected on post-IR HDMEC. Flow assays revealed a significant increase in the number of rolling and firmly adherent HL-60 cells on post-IR HDMEC at shear stress < or =1.5 dynes/cm2; pretreatment of control and irradiated HDMEC with antibodies to E-selectin and ICAM-1 significantly diminished the number of rolling and firmly adherent HL-60 cells, respectively. No rolling or firm adhesion of HL-60 cells was observed on HUVEC or HMEC-1 monolayers post-IR. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that ICAM-1 is upregulated on irradiated HDMEC, HUVEC, and HMEC-1. E-selectin is upregulated to a functional level only on irradiated HDMEC, and not on irradiated HUVEC or HMEC-1.","['Prabhakarpandian, B', 'Goetz, D J', 'Swerlick, R A', 'Chen, X', 'Kiani, M F']","['Prabhakarpandian B', 'Goetz DJ', 'Swerlick RA', 'Chen X', 'Kiani MF']","['School of Biomedical Engineering and Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, TN 38163, USA.']",['eng'],['CA-68154/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Microcirculation,"Microcirculation (New York, N.Y. : 1994)",9434935,"['0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (E-Selectin)', '126547-89-5 (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1)']",IM,"['Cell Adhesion/drug effects', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/*biosynthesis/pharmacology/physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'E-Selectin/biosynthesis/pharmacology/physiology', 'Endothelium, Vascular/cytology/*metabolism/radiation effects', 'Flow Cytometry', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1/biosynthesis/pharmacology/physiology', 'Leukocytes/cytology', 'Microcirculation', 'Perfusion', 'Radiation, Ionizing', 'Skin/blood supply', 'Stress, Mechanical', 'Umbilical Cord/cytology', 'Up-Regulation/*radiation effects']",2001/11/01 10:00,2002/02/06 10:01,['2001/11/01 10:00'],"['2001/01/24 00:00 [received]', '2001/07/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2001/11/01 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/02/06 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/01 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj/mn/7800105 [doi]'],ppublish,Microcirculation. 2001 Oct;8(5):355-64. doi: 10.1038/sj/mn/7800105.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Distribution of interferon protein after IACB administration was different from that seen with the subcutaneous delivery of interferon protein. Higher levels of interferon protein were observed in liver and spleen after IACB delivery compared to protein delivery. The antitumor efficacy of IACB, as measured by suppression of tumor growth, was tested in athymic nude mice bearing established human tumor xenografts from different types of human cancer. Subcutaneous tumors most responsive to the intratumoral administration of IACB ranked as U87MG (glioblastoma) and K562 (chronic myelogenous leukemia), followed by Hep 3B (hepatocellular carcinoma) and LN229 cells (glioblastoma). Intravenous administration of IACB in animals bearing U87MG or Hep 3B xenografts was also effective in suppressing tumor growth, although to a lesser extent than the intratumoral administration. IACB was also tested in a metastatic model in beige/SCID mice generated with H69 (small cell lung carcinoma) cells and was found to prolong survival in tumor-bearing animals.

Hoxa9 and Meis1a cooperate to induce acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in mice, and are coexpressed in human AML. Despite their cooperativity in leukemogenesis, we demonstrated previously that retroviral expression of Hoxa9 alone--in the absence of coexpressed retroviral Meis1 or of expression of endogenous Meis genes--blocks neutrophil and macrophage differentiation of primary myeloid progenitors cultured in granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). Expression of Meis1 alone did not immortalize any factor-dependent marrow progenitor. Because HoxA9-immortalized progenitors still execute granulocytic differentiation in response to granulocyte CSF (G-CSF) and monocyte differentiation in response to macrophage CSF (M-CSF), we tested the possibility that Meis1a cooperates with Hoxa9 by blocking viable differentiation pathways unaffected by Hoxa9 alone. Here we report that Meis1a suppresses G-CSF-induced granulocytic differentiation of Hoxa9-immortalized progenitors, permitting indefinite self-renewal in G-CSF. Meis1a also reprograms Hoxa9-immortalized progenitors to proliferate, rather than die, in response to stem cell factor (SCF) alone. We propose that Meis1a and Hoxa9 are part of a molecular switch that regulates progenitor abundance by suppressing differentiation and maintaining self-renewal in response to different subsets of cytokines during myelopoiesis. The independent differentiation pathways targeted by Hoxa9 and Meis1a prompt a ""cooperative differentiation arrest"" hypothesis for a subset of leukemia, in which cooperating transcription factor oncoproteins block complementary subsets of differentiation pathways, establishing a more complete differentiation block in vivo.","['Calvo, K R', 'Knoepfler, P S', 'Sykes, D B', 'Pasillas, M P', 'Kamps, M P']","['Calvo KR', 'Knoepfler PS', 'Sykes DB', 'Pasillas MP', 'Kamps MP']","['Department of Pathology, University of California, School of Medicine, 9500 Gilman Drive, La Jolla, CA 92093-0612, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA056876/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA077109/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA56876/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA77109-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (MEIS1 protein, human)', '0 (Meis1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '0 (homeobox protein HOXA9)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/genetics/*physiology', 'Cell Division/drug effects/*physiology', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacology', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*physiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*physiology', 'Stem Cell Factor/*pharmacology', 'Subcellular Fractions/metabolism']",2001/11/01 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/11/01 10:00'],"['2001/11/01 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/01 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1073/pnas.231115398 [doi]', '231115398 [pii]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2001 Nov 6;98(23):13120-5. doi: 10.1073/pnas.231115398.

Other technical factors significantly affecting results were also identified.

To this end, we compared expression of RNA encoding the receptors for interleukin-3 (IL-3), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), IL-6, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and stem cell factor (SCF) in populations of primitive hematopoietic progenitors (lineage marker negative, Lin(-), and Lin(-) c-Kit(+)) by RT-PCR and in situ RT-PCR. Both Lin(-) and Lin(-) c-Kit(+) progenitors expressed all receptors by RT-PCR. However, RT-PCR could not distinguish between the possibility that all cells expressed growth factor receptor RNA, or the possibility that only a proportion of cells expressed RNA. Therefore, we used in situ RT-PCR to examine growth factor receptor mRNA expression in individual cells. In contrast to RT-PCR, we observed that only 40-80% of Lin(-) cells and 75-100% of Lin(-) c-Kit(+) cells were positive for expression of the growth factor receptor subunits, demonstrating that not all cells were receptor positive. We found that in situ RT-PCR could also be used to measure induction or repression of receptor RNA expression in these cell populations. Specifically, the percentage of cells expressing IL-6alpha receptor RNA decreased from 88% positive in freshly harvested cells to 9% in Lin(-) c-Kit(+) cells cultured in IL-3 for 18 h. Thus, in situ RT-PCR can be used to detect and quantify the number of individual cells that express growth factor receptor mRNA, and may also be useful to measure changes in expression of other endogenous genes or genes introduced by transfection and gene therapy vectors.","['Spence, S E', 'Lohrey, N C', 'Ortiz, M', 'Gooya, J', 'Keller, J R']","['Spence SE', 'Lohrey NC', 'Ortiz M', 'Gooya J', 'Keller JR']","['Intramural Research Support Program, SAIC Frederick, Division of Basic Science, National Cancer Institute-Frederick, P.O.

This is primarily due to the paucity of the coxsackievirus-Ad receptor on these cells. In an attempt to change the tropism of Ad5, we constructed a series of chimeric E1-deleted Ad5 vectors in which the shaft and knob of the capsid fibers were exchanged with those of other Ad serotypes. In all these vectors, the Ad E1 region was replaced by an expression cassette containing the cytomegalovirus immediate-early promoter and the gene for enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP). Experiments performed in vitro showed an efficient transduction of umbilical cord blood (UCB) monocytes, granulocytes, and their precursors as well as the undifferentiated CD34(+) CD33(-) CD38(-) CD71(-) cells by Ad5 vectors carrying Ad subgroup B-specific fiber chimeras (Ad5FBs). In the latter subpopulation, which comprises less than 1% of the CD34(+) cells and is highly enriched with cells repopulating immunodeficient mice, more than 90% of the cells were GFP(+). Transduction by Ad5FBs of the less primitive fraction within UCB CD34(+) cells was significant lower. Actually, the transduction frequency and GFP level declined gradually with increased expression of the CD33, CD38, and CD71 antigens. Flow cytometric analysis of transduced UCB CD34(+) cells that were cultured for 5 days on an allogeneic human bone marrow stroma layer showed maintenance of the phenotypically defined HSCs at levels similar to those of control cultures. The latter finding indicates that neither the transduction procedure nor the high levels of GFP were toxic for these cells.","['Knaan-Shanzer, S', 'Van Der Velde, I', 'Havenga, M J', 'Lemckert, A A', 'De Vries, A A', 'Valerio, D']","['Knaan-Shanzer S', 'Van Der Velde I', 'Havenga MJ', 'Lemckert AA', 'De Vries AA', 'Valerio D']","['Gene Therapy Section, Department of Molecular Cell Biology, Leiden University Medical Center, 2333 AL Leiden, The Netherlands. s.knaan@lumc.nl']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Hum Gene Ther,Human gene therapy,9008950,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)']",IM,"['Adenoviridae/*genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA Primers', '*Genetic Vectors', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/immunology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/pathology', 'Luminescent Proteins/genetics', '*Transduction, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/11/01 10:00,2002/02/14 10:01,['2001/11/01 10:00'],"['2001/11/01 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/02/14 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/01 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/104303401753204562 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Gene Ther. 2001 Nov 1;12(16):1989-2005. doi: 10.1089/104303401753204562.,,,['Hum Gene Ther. 2003 Aug 10;14(12):1214'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The usefulness of these agents is limited by cardiotoxicity, with congestive heart failure developing in up to 20% of patients. To stratify possible risk factors, we investigated 38 children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia for signs of late cardiomyopathy. Exercise-spiroergometry and stress-echocardiography with measurement of fractional shortening (FS) and ejection fraction (EF) as indicators of left ventricular function were performed. ECG, 24 h Holter monitoring, chest X-ray, virus serology and carnitine were analysed. Control subjects were 38 healthy children matched for age and body surface area. All 38 patients had normal echocardiographic findings at rest (EF: 0.73 +/- 0.06; FS: 0.35 +/- 0.05). ten patients had a significant attenuation of left ventricular function after exercise assessed by stress-echocardiography compared to the remaining 28 patients and 38 healthy control subjects (EF: 0.52 +/- 0.08 versus 0.77 +/- 0.06 and 0.80 +/- 0.08; FS: 0.29 +/- 0.06 versus 0.39 +/- 0.05 and 0.41 +/- 0.02); patients with reduced ventricular function after exercise had significant low anaerobic threshold, subnormal maximal oxygen uptake and decreased carnitine levels. The findings were not related to the dosage of administered doxorubicin. There exists no correlation between ECG, 24 h ECG, chest X-ray, virology and left ventricular dysfunction. The benefit of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and the administration of carnitine remains speculative. CONCLUSION: exercise-spiroergometry and stress-echocardiography are sensitive investigations for diagnosing subclinical cardiomyopathy late after completion of chemotherapy. Investigative findings of cardiomyopathy are not dose related and may provide information for therapeutic prevention before clinical symptoms of cardiomyopathy appear.","['Hauser, M', 'Gibson, B S', 'Wilson, N']","['Hauser M', 'Gibson BS', 'Wilson N']","['Deutsches Herzzentrum, Department of Paediatric Cardiology, Munich, Germany. hauser@dhm.mhn.de']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Germany,Eur J Pediatr,European journal of pediatrics,7603873,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)']",IM,"['Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*adverse effects', 'Cardiomyopathies/*chemically induced/diagnosis/physiopathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Echocardiography/methods', 'Electrocardiography', 'Exercise Test/methods', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'Spirometry/methods', 'Stroke Volume/drug effects', 'Ventricular Function, Left/drug effects']",2001/11/01 10:00,2002/02/06 10:01,['2001/11/01 10:00'],"['2001/11/01 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/02/06 10:01 [medline]', '2001/11/01 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s004310100830 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Pediatr. 2001 Oct;160(10):607-10. doi: 10.1007/s004310100830.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

AVWS type I or III, which occurs in a minority of patients with Wilms' tumour in the complete absence of an inhibitor against VWF and no absorption of factor VIII or VWF onto nephroblastoma cells, responds to chemotherapy and/or tumour resection. Hyaluronic acid produced by nephroblastoma cells may be the causative factor in atypical AVWS in Wilms' tumour. AVWS associated with thrombocythaemia of various myeloproliferative disorders is characterized by normal factor VIII and von Willebrand factor antigen (VWF: Ag) levels and a selective deficiency of functional ristocetin co-factor activity (VWF: RCo) and collagen-binding activity (VWF: CBA). AVWS type II in thrombocythaemia is caused by a platelet-dependent proteolysis of large VWF multimers, given the inverse relationship between platelet count and large VWF multimers in plasma and specific increases in the number of proteolytic VWF fragments in plasma. The laboratory findings of AVWS associated with systemic lupus erythematosus or IgG benign monoclonal gammopathy are characterized by a prolonged bleeding time and activated partial thromboplastin time, decreased or absent ristocetin-induced platelet activity, low to very low levels of factor VIII coagulant activity (mean 15%), VWF: Ag (mean 10.7%) and VWF: RCo (mean 6.2%), and a type II multimeric pattern of VWF. Neutralizing and non-neutralizing anti-VWF autoantibodies, usually IgG, have been detected in patient plasma either free or tightly bound to the intermediate and high molecular weight VWF factor VIII particles. The bound auto antibody-antigen complex is rapidly cleared from the circulation, resulting in low levels of factor VIII, VWF parameters as documented by a poor response to desmopressin and VWF factor VIII concentrate. High-dose intravenous immunoglobulin transiently corrects the factor VIII coagulant and VWF levels, lasting for a few weeks in AVWS type II associated with systemic lupus erythematosus or IgG benign monoclonal gammopathy. Prednisolone is effective in AVWS associated with autoimmune disorder. Prednisolone and chemotherapy will not affect AVWS associated with IgG benign monoclonal gammopathy because the monoclonal IgG protein remains to act as an anti-VWF autoantibody. An absorption of VWF to malignant cells has been documented in a few patients with various lymphoproliferative disorders or adrenal carcinoma and suggested to result in a depletion of VWF. The clinical picture of AVWS associated with early-stage IgG multiple myeloma, chronic lymphocytic leukaemia or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma without a paraprotein or no detectable underlying disorder is similar to that of AVWS type II in IgG benign monoclonal gammopathy but poorly documented with regard to the underlying immune mechanism of AVWS. The mechanical destruction of large VWF multimers may be of relevance in conditions in which the shear rate of flowing blood is increased, as may occur in cases of aortic stenosis, other heart valve defects or stenosed vessels. Drug-induced AVWS has been described in association with the use of pesticides valproic acid, ciprofloxacin, griseofulvin, tetracycline, thrombolytic agents and hydroxyethyl starch.","['Michiels, J J', 'Budde, U', 'van der Planken, M', 'van Vliet, H H', 'Schroyens, W', 'Berneman, Z']","['Michiels JJ', 'Budde U', 'van der Planken M', 'van Vliet HH', 'Schroyens W', 'Berneman Z']","['Department of Haematology, University Hospital Antwerp, Belgium.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,Best Pract Res Clin Haematol,Best practice & research.

In this study, we report the identification, sequence, and expression profile of a new member of the CD20/FcepsilonRIbeta family, CD20/FcepsilonRIbeta family member 4 (CFFM4). The CFFM4 gene contains seven exons and six introns and is transcribed into an mRNA encoding a 240-amino acid protein with four hydrophobic regions. The CFFM4 protein shares a high degree of homology with the other members of the family, especially in the hydrophobic regions where several amino acids are conserved. However, the CFFM4 protein can be distinguished from the other members of the family based on the length of the second extracellular loop and the absence of an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif signal. Another distinct characteristic is that CFFM4 mRNA expression is not limited to the hematopoietic lineage. CFFM4 was detected by Northern dot blot in a variety of normal and cancerous tissues. CFFM4 expression was also compared in developmentally early hematopoietic human bone marrow CD34+ stem cells versus peripheral blood-derived CD14+ mature monocytes, in the undifferentiated versus differentiated myelomonocytic U937 cell line, and in acute myelogenous leukemia FAB1 versus FAB5. In each of these systems, cellular myelomonocytic differentiation correlated with an increase in CFFM4 mRNA expression. Such results indicate that CFFM4 is associated with mature cellular function in the monocytic lineage and like CD20 and FcepsilonRIbeta, it may be a component of a receptor complex involved in signal transduction.","['Gingras, M C', 'Lapillonne, H', 'Margolin, J F']","['Gingras MC', 'Lapillonne H', 'Margolin JF']","[""Baylor College of Medicine, Department of Pediatrics, Texas Children's Cancer Center, Texas Children Hospital, Feigin Center, 6621 Fannin Street, MC3-3320, Houston, TX 77030, USA. mgingras@txccc.org""]",['eng'],['U01 CA080200/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Immunogenetics,Immunogenetics,0420404,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD20)', '0 (MS4A7 protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antigens, CD/*biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Antigens, CD20/*genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Monocytes/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Receptors, IgE/*biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Tissue Distribution', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'U937 Cells']",2001/10/31 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/10/31 10:00'],"['2001/01/25 00:00 [received]', '2001/10/31 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/31 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s002510100345 [doi]'],ppublish,Immunogenetics. 2001 Aug;53(6):468-76. doi: 10.1007/s002510100345.,,,,,,,,,['GENBANK/AF309653'],,,,,,,,,,,

Here we present an algorithm for detecting such loops from gene expression profiles. Our method is based on the hypothesis that for some autocrine pathways, the ligand and receptor are regulated by coupled mechanisms at the level of transcription, and thus ligand-receptor pairs comprising such a loop should have correlated mRNA expression. Using our database of experimentally known ligand-receptor signaling partners, we found examples of ligand-receptor pairs with significantly correlated expression in five cancer-based gene expression datasets. The correlated ligand-receptor pairs we identified are consistent with known autocrine signaling events in cancer cells. In addition, our algorithm predicts new autocrine signaling loops that can be verified experimentally. Chemokines were commonly members of these potential autocrine pathways. Our analysis also revealed ligand-receptor pairs with expression patterns that may indicate cellular mechanisms for preventing autocrine signaling.","['Graeber, T G', 'Eisenberg, D']","['Graeber TG', 'Eisenberg D']","['Howard Hughes Medical Institute, UCLA-Department of Energy Laboratory of Structural Biology and Molecular Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles, California 90095, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Letter', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Nat Genet,Nature genetics,9216904,['0 (Ligands)'],IM,"['*Algorithms', 'Autocrine Communication/*genetics', 'Computational Biology/*methods', 'Databases, Factual', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics', 'Ligands', 'Lymphoma/genetics', 'Neoplasms/genetics/*metabolism', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Probability', 'Protein Binding/genetics', 'Signal Transduction/*genetics']",2001/10/31 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/10/31 10:00'],"['2001/10/31 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/31 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/ng755 [doi]', 'ng755 [pii]']",ppublish,Nat Genet. 2001 Nov;29(3):295-300. doi: 10.1038/ng755.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The health histories of siblings of HH patients are reported. METHODS: Individuals homozygous for HH were mailed questionnaires concerning the health histories of their siblings. Spouses of the HH homozygotes were asked to complete accompanying questionnaires concerning their siblings. The frequencies of serious illness and, when specified, each reported disease were determined by zygosity, odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals estimated. RESULTS: Data were available for 279 siblings known to be HH homozygotes (HHs), and 1,265 other siblings of HH patients, who are predominantly hemochromatosis heterozygotes (HHhet). Controls consisted of 1,338 spouse siblings in whom only the general population prevalence of HH homozygosity and heterozygosity existed. Odds ratios comparing HH strata to controls were elevated for serious illness (1.12 in HHhet, 1.71 in HHs), diabetes (0.78, 2.45), arthritis (2.10, 1.69), and hepatoma (1.06, 11.96).

These partners are themselves DNA-binding, homeodomain proteins, and probably function by revealing the intrinsic specificity of Hox proteins. Vertebrate orthologs of Exd and Hth, known as Pbx and Meis (named for a myeloid ecotropic leukemia virus integration site), respectively, are encoded by multigene families and are present in multimeric complexes together with vertebrate Hox proteins. Previous results have demonstrated that the zygotically encoded Pbx4/Lazarus (Lzr) protein is required for segmentation of the zebrafish hindbrain and proper expression and function of Hox genes. We demonstrate that Meis functions in the same pathway as Pbx in zebrafish hindbrain development, as expression of a dominant-negative mutant Meis results in phenotypes that are remarkably similar to that of lzr mutants. Surprisingly, expression of Meis protein partially rescues the lzr(-) phenotype. Lzr protein levels are increased in embryos overexpressing Meis and are reduced for lzr mutants that cannot bind to Meis. This implies a mechanism whereby Meis rescues lzr mutants by stabilizing maternally encoded Lzr. Our results define two functions of Meis during zebrafish hindbrain segmentation: that of a DNA-binding partner of Pbx proteins, and that of a post-transcriptional regulator of Pbx protein levels.","['Waskiewicz, A J', 'Rikhof, H A', 'Hernandez, R E', 'Moens, C B']","['Waskiewicz AJ', 'Rikhof HA', 'Hernandez RE', 'Moens CB']","['Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Division of Basic Sciences and Program in Developmental Biology, B2-152, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, 1100 Fairview Ave. N., Seattle, WA 98109, USA.']",['eng'],"['T32 HD007183/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', '1RO1HD37909/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Development,"Development (Cambridge, England)",8701744,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Hoxb2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Meis3 protein, zebrafish)', '0 (Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (PBX4 protein, human)', '0 (Pbx4 protein, zebrafish)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Zebrafish Proteins)', '0 (meis2b protein, zebrafish)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Body Patterning/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Embryo, Nonmammalian', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Genes, Dominant', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins', 'Rhombencephalon/*embryology', 'Transcription Factors/genetics', 'Zebrafish/*embryology/genetics', 'Zebrafish Proteins/*genetics/metabolism']",2001/10/31 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/10/31 10:00'],"['2001/10/31 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/31 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Development. 2001 Nov;128(21):4139-51.,,,,,,,,,"['GENBANK/AF375872', 'GENBANK/AF376049', 'GENBANK/AF382393', 'GENBANK/AF382395']",,,,,,,,,,,

A dose dependent increase in micronucleus formation was detected over a nominal concentration range of 0.05-2 mM for HCFC-123 and halothane, but this was not seen with HCFC-141b. No dose response for HCFC-123 was seen in a control cHo1 cell line not expressing this cytochrome P450's. Cell lines expressing individual human cytochrome P-450 (CYP) forms were also used to define the enzymes responsible for the clastogenic events and to investigate the formation of immunoreactive protein by microsomal fractions. It was shown that CYP2E1 or CYP2B6 catalysed the clastogenic response, but CYP2D6, CYP3A4, CYP1A2 or CYP1A1 all appeared to be inactive. The formation of neoantigenic trifluoroacetylated protein adducts by microsomal mixtures incubated with HCFC-123 and NADPH was catalysed primarily by CYP2E1 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C19, whereas, only trace levels of immunoreactive protein were seen with microsomes expressing CYP2B6 or CYP2C8. With perchloroethylene as a substrate, the extent of activation was low in comparison with HCFC-123, as judged by the absence of micronuclei formation in the MCL-5 cell line and the weak immunoreactivity of proteins following Western blotting. CYP1A2, CYP2B6 and CYP2C8 appeared to be responsible for perchloroethylene immunoreactivity and in contrast to the findings with the HCFC's, no activation of perchloroethylene by CYP2E1 could be detected. These results show that even though both saturated and unsaturated halocarbons can result in neoantigen formation, there is a marked difference in the specificity of the CYP enzymes involved in their metabolic activation.","['White, I N', 'Razvi, N', 'Gibbs, A H', 'Davies, A M', 'Manno, M', 'Zaccaro, C', 'De Matteis, F', 'Pahler, A', 'Dekant, W']","['White IN', 'Razvi N', 'Gibbs AH', 'Davies AM', 'Manno M', 'Zaccaro C', 'De Matteis F', 'Pahler A', 'Dekant W']","['MRC Toxicology Unit, Hodgkin Building, University of Leicester, Lancaster Road, Leicester LE1 9HN, UK. iw6@le.ac.uk']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Toxicol Lett,Toxicology letters,7709027,"['0 (Antigens)', '0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (Chlorofluorocarbons)', '0 (Chlorofluorocarbons, Ethane)', '306-83-2 (2,2-dichloro-1,1,1-trifluoroethane)', '9035-51-2 (Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System)', 'O1A3ASY5PW (1,1-dichloro-1-fluoroethane)', 'TJ904HH8SN (Tetrachloroethylene)']",IM,"['Antigens/*analysis', 'Blotting, Western', 'Carcinogens/*adverse effects', 'Chlorofluorocarbons/*adverse effects/*immunology', 'Chlorofluorocarbons, Ethane', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System/*metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/pathology', 'Micronucleus Tests', 'Tetrachloroethylene/*adverse effects/immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/10/31 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/10/31 10:00'],"['2001/10/31 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/31 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0378427400002812 [pii]', '10.1016/s0378-4274(00)00281-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Toxicol Lett. 2001 Oct 15;124(1-3):129-38. doi: 10.1016/s0378-4274(00)00281-2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using this method it was possible to monitor the presence of proviral DNA in four sheep infected experimentally with BLV, over a 10 months postinfection period, as well as in 29 cattle infected naturally.

One of the most common and well-studied mechanisms implicated in causing MDR is P-glycoprotein (Pgp), an ATP-dependent, transmembrane drug efflux pump. Accurate and reproducible detection of this MDR protein is necessary as it may have important clinical implications. In this study comparing the directly conjugated anti-Pgp monoclonal antibodies UIC2-PE and 15D3-PE to the unconjugated anti-Pgp mAb MRK16, we analyzed cell lines, normal peripheral blood cells, and bone marrow cells from pediatric patients diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia; all samples were also analyzed for Pgp function using rhodamine 123 in order to correlate results from antibody staining with functional activity. For all patient samples evaluated, only MRK16 correlated well with the rhodamine 123 assay. Both the directly conjugated antibodies UIC2-PE and 15D3-PE failed to detect Pgp in almost all cases. Pre-treatment of cells with neuraminidase did not provide a consistent enhancement of antigen detection. Based on these results, we suggest that while UIC2-PE and 15D3-PE may be able to detect the very high levels of Pgp expressing laboratory-cultured cell lines, they are not suitable for clinical application in their currently available conjugated form. When assaying patient samples for Pgp expression and function using flow cytometry, the rhodamine 123 functional assay should be performed in concert with staining with MRK16.","['Taylor, B J', 'Olson, D P', 'Ivy, S P']","['Taylor BJ', 'Olson DP', 'Ivy SP']","[""Division of Hematology-Oncology, Children's National Medical Center, Washington, DC 20010, USA.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '1N3CZ14C5O (Rhodamine 123)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*analysis/immunology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Rhodamine 123/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/10/31 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/10/31 10:00'],"['2001/10/31 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/31 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0145212601000856 [pii]', '10.1016/s0145-2126(01)00085-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2001 Dec;25(12):1127-35. doi: 10.1016/s0145-2126(01)00085-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, the nuclear localization of them may be related to poor prognosis and metastasis, while the mechanism is uncertain. We previously reported that m-M-CSF and its receptor played auto-juxtacrine and adhesion molecule role in human leukemia cell line J6-1. In this paper, we show that HL-60 cells highly express M-CSF and its receptor. The localization of positive reactions was mainly in cytoplasma and nuclear in HL-60 cells. In cytoplasma and nuclear, three isoforms of M-CSF were found with molecular weight (MW) of 20, 16 and 14 kDa, while one type of m-CSF receptor (M-CSFR) was discovered with MW of 120 kDa. Immunoprecipitation assay showed that these ligands could exist separately or binding with their receptor. Monoclonal antibody (McAb) against M-CSF and anti-sense oligodeoxynucleotides (ASON) blocking M-CSF expression inhibited the proliferation of HL-60 cells. McAb and ASON regulated the expression of cyclin D1/E, CDK2/4 and p16. Simultaneous administration of both McAb and ASON inhibited the proliferation of HL-60 cells and modulate the expression of cyclins at greater degrees. Our results suggested an autocrine and possible an intracrine loop of M-CSF/M-CSFR in HL-60 cells.","['Tang, S S', 'Zheng, G G', 'Wu, K F', 'Chen, G B', 'Liu, H Z', 'Rao, Q']","['Tang SS', 'Zheng GG', 'Wu KF', 'Chen GB', 'Liu HZ', 'Rao Q']","[""State Key Laboratory for Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, 288 Nanjing Road, Tianjin 300020, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Cyclin E)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides, Antisense)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)', '81627-83-0 (Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Cell Division', 'Cyclin D1/analysis', 'Cyclin E/analysis', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16/analysis', 'HL-60 Cells/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/analysis/*physiology', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides, Antisense/pharmacology', 'Receptor, Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/analysis']",2001/10/31 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/10/31 10:00'],"['2001/10/31 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/31 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0145212601000790 [pii]', '10.1016/s0145-2126(01)00079-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2001 Dec;25(12):1107-14. doi: 10.1016/s0145-2126(01)00079-0.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sensitivity to etoposide was measured by trypan blue and annexin V assays. Etoposide-induced peroxide formation was associated with the induction of cell death. Evident expression of mutated p53 was observed in both subclones in basal growth conditions as analysed by Western blotting and flow cytometry. After etoposide exposure for up to 24 hours, some nuclear accumulation of p53 was observed in the ER subclone, as analysed by Western blotting. The conformation of p53, however, was not changed from mutated toward wild-type during exposure in either of the subclones as analysed by flow cytometry. In conclusion, etoposide-induced change in cellular redox state was associated with apoptosis, but was not a sufficient stimulus for p53 to make its conformation active.

The rearrangement was identified by Southern blot analysis using a joining region (Jdelta1) specific probe and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with a variable region (Vdelta2) and Jdelta1 specific primers. The nucleotide sequence analysis of an atypical 3000 bp PCR product allowed localization of the breakpoint within the TCRdelta gene locus, 2.6 kb 3' from the Vdelta2 gene segment. A regular Ddelta2-Ddelta3-Jdelta1 joining was found at the 3' end of the breakpoint, indicating that the rearrangement was mediated by the VDJ recombinase, but no TCRdelta gene segment was detected at the 5' end. Analysis of the germline sequence 3' from the breakpoint revealed an isolated recombination signal sequence (RSS) capable of initiating a rearrangement. The RSS motif described by us is the second TCRdelta recombining element (deltaRec2). The deltaRec2(Ddelta)Jdelta1 recombination is a rather rare event and can be found in acute leukemia and in PBL from healthy individuals. Most likely, the nonfunctional deltaRec2(Ddelta)Jdelta1 rearrangement is a transient step during the VDJ recombination. It may potentially lead to deletion of the deltaRec2(Ddelta)Jdelta1 complex and either to direct joining of a Vdelta region to one of the downstream Jdelta regions or to a rearrangement of the TCRalpha gene.","['Przybylski, G K', 'Oettle, H', 'Siegert, W', 'Schmidt, C A']","['Przybylski GK', 'Oettle H', 'Siegert W', 'Schmidt CA']","['HU Berlin, UKRV, Abt.

A successful MRD detection approach requires a stable marker and for lymphoid leukemias clonal rearrangements of immunoglobulin (Ig) and T cell receptor (TCR) genes are commonly used. In the present study, Ig heavy chain (IgH) and TCR (gamma and delta) genes were studied in 18 consecutive, relapsing precursor-B ALL patients. At least one clonal rearrangement was found in all cases at presentation (IgH 94%, TCRgamma 39% and TCRdelta 28%). An altered rearrangement pattern between diagnosis and relapse was demonstrated in 14 patients (78%). At least one stable molecular target was found in 13 out of 18 cases (72%). Clonal differences between diagnostic and relapse samples were explained by: (1) loss of original rearrangements; (2) V(H) to DJ(H) joining; (3) V(H) gene replacement; (4) appearance of new rearrangements. In two cases with apparently new IgH gene rearrangements at relapse extended sequencing of the diagnostic samples revealed minor clonal rearrangements identical to the relapse clones. Interestingly, one patient displayed instability on both the IgH and TCR gene loci, whereas a stable Igkappa rearrangement was found at presentation and relapse. These data show that clonal diversity is common in precursor-B ALL and strongly suggest that MRD detection should include multiple gene targets to minimize false-negative samples. Even so, five of our 18 relapse cases (28%) lacked stable clonal markers and should have been unsuitable for MRD detection.","['Li, A H', 'Rosenquist, R', 'Forestier, E', 'Lindh, J', 'Roos, G']","['Li AH', 'Rosenquist R', 'Forestier E', 'Lindh J', 'Roos G']","['Department of Medical Biosciences, Pathology, Umea University, 90187 Umea, Sweden.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Base Sequence', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Gene Rearrangement', 'Gene Rearrangement, T-Lymphocyte', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*genetics']",2001/10/31 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/10/31 10:00'],"['2001/10/31 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/31 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0145212601000728 [pii]', '10.1016/s0145-2126(01)00072-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2001 Dec;25(12):1033-45. doi: 10.1016/s0145-2126(01)00072-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This RA-induced ERK2 activation appears after approximately 4 h and persists until the cells are differentiated and G0 arrested (Yen et al, 1998). This motivates the question of whether RA also activated RAF as part of a typical RAF/MEK/MAPK cascade. Retinoic acid is shown here to also increase the phosphorylation of RAF, but in an unusual way. Surprisingly, increased RAF phosphorylation is first detectable after 12 to 24 hours by phosphorylation-induced retardation of polyacrylamide gel electrophoretic mobility. The RA-induced increased RAF phosphorylation is still apparent after 72 hours of treatment when most cells are differentiated and G0 arrested. There is a progressive dose-response relationship with 10(-8), 10(-7), and 10(-6) M RA. The RA-induced RAF phosphorylation corresponds to increased in vitro kinase activity. Inhibition of MEK with a PD98059 dose which inhibits ERK2 phosphorylation and subsequent cell differentiation also inhibits RAF phosphorylation. RA-induced MEK-dependent RAF phosphorylation is not due to changes in the amount of cellular MEK. The induced RAF phosphorylation, as well as anteceding ERK2 activation, depends on ligand-induced activation of both an RARalpha receptor and an RXR receptor. This and the slow kinetics of activation suggest a need for prior RA-induced gene expression. In summary, RA induces a MEK-dependent prolonged RAF activation, whose slow onset occurs after ERK2 activation but still well before cell cycle arrest and cell differentiation. The RA-induced increased RAF phosphorylation thus differs from typical mitogenic growth factor signaling, features that may contribute to cell cycle arrest and differentiation instead of division as the cellular outcome.","['Hong, H Y', 'Varvayanis, S', 'Yen, A']","['Hong HY', 'Varvayanis S', 'Yen A']","['Department of Biomedical Science, College of Veterinary Medicine, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Differentiation,Differentiation; research in biological diversity,0401650,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Maleimides)', '0 (Naphthalenes)', '0 (RARA protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '0 (Retinoid X Receptors)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (MAP Kinase Kinase Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (MAP3K1 protein, human)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)', 'I271P23G24 (calphostin C)', 'L79H6N0V6C (bisindolylmaleimide I)', 'SJE1IO5E3I (2-(2-amino-3-methoxyphenyl)-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Flavonoids/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Indoles/pharmacology', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Interphase/drug effects', '*MAP Kinase Kinase Kinase 1', 'Maleimides/pharmacology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/metabolism', 'Naphthalenes/pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Kinase C/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/*metabolism', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha', 'Retinoid X Receptors', 'Staurosporine/pharmacology', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Tretinoin/metabolism/*pharmacology']",2001/10/31 10:00,2002/03/20 10:01,['2001/10/31 10:00'],"['2001/10/31 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/20 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/31 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-4681(09)60505-3 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1432-0436.2001.068001055.x [doi]']",ppublish,Differentiation. 2001 Aug;68(1):55-66. doi: 10.1046/j.1432-0436.2001.068001055.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Embryonic and extra-embryonic tissues are supposed to contribute to cardiac lineage commitment before and during gastrulation in a paracrine fashion. Evidence has accumulated that factors secreted by the anterior lateral endoderm and extra-embryonic endoderm contribute to cardiomyogenesis. Here we exploit in vitro differentiation of embryonic stem cells in embryoid bodies to study differentiation of the extraembryonic endodermal lineage, gastrulation-like processes, and the influence of endoderm on cardiomyogenesis. We demonstrate that in embryoid bodies primitive endoderm differentiates to visceral and parietal endoderm and that parietal endoderm influences onset of cardiomyogenesis in a concentration-dependent manner. Both increased concentrations of leukemia inhibitory factor and its absence in lif-/- embryoid bodies hampered parietal endoderm formation. Reduced differentiation of parietal endoderm correlated with an attenuation of cardiomyogenesis even in the presence of LIE These and previous results suggest that leukemia inhibitory factor is directly and indirectly, via endoderm formation, involved in the regulation of cardiomyogenesis. Increased proliferation of parietal endoderm in lifr -/- embryoid bodies and addition of conditioned lif -/- cell culture supernatant promoted cardiomyogenesis, demonstrating for the first time that parietal endoderm also contributes to cardiomyogenesis in embryoid bodies in a paracrine and leukemia inhibitory factor and its receptor independent pathway. New factors signaling independently of the leukemia inhibitory-factor receptor pathway may sustain cardiomyocyte cell proliferation and thus be a future target for gene therapy of cardiomyopathies and cell therapy of the myocardium.","['Bader, A', 'Gruss, A', 'Hollrigl, A', 'Al-Dubai, H', 'Capetanaki, Y', 'Weitzer, G']","['Bader A', 'Gruss A', 'Hollrigl A', 'Al-Dubai H', 'Capetanaki Y', 'Weitzer G']","['Institute of Medical Biochemistry, Vienna Biocenter, University of Vienna, Wien, Austria.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Differentiation,Differentiation; research in biological diversity,0401650,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Embryo, Mammalian/cytology', 'Embryo, Nonmammalian', 'Embryonic Induction', 'Endoderm/*drug effects/physiology', 'Growth Inhibitors/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Heart/*embryology', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Receptors, Cytokine/drug effects/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF', 'Stem Cells']",2001/10/31 10:00,2002/03/20 10:01,['2001/10/31 10:00'],"['2001/10/31 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/20 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/31 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-4681(09)60503-X [pii]', '10.1046/j.1432-0436.2001.068001031.x [doi]']",ppublish,Differentiation. 2001 Aug;68(1):31-43. doi: 10.1046/j.1432-0436.2001.068001031.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Small latent TGF-beta is secreted from cells and deposited into the extracellular matrix as covalent complexes with its binding proteins, LTBPs. Four LTBPs have been molecularly cloned and their structures contain repetitive sequences. The 3rd 8-Cys repeats of LTBP-1, -3 and -4 are able to associate with small latent TGF-beta. We analyzed by RT-PCR the expression of LTBPs 1-4 in a panel of cultured human cell lines including fibroblasts of different origin, endothelial cells and immortalized keratinocytes. LTBPs were expressed in an overlapping manner, but differences in their expression levels were detected. SV-40 transformed human embryonic lung fibroblasts contained less of the mRNAs for the LTBPs, suggesting that malignant transformation leads to decrease in LTBP expression. A novel alternatively spliced form of LTBP-4 lacking the 3rd 8-Cys repeat (LTBP-4delta8-Cys3rd) was identified. LTBP-4delta8-Cys3rd does not bind TGF-beta and it was found to be expressed in the same tissues as the full length LTBP-4. The exon-intron structure of LTBP-4 around the 3rd 8-Cys repeat was similar to those of LTBP-2 and -3. LTBP-4delta8-Cys3rd was produced by alternative splicing over two exons.

Since the extracellular matrix (ECM) plays an important role in regulating the effects of many growth factors, the hypothesis was tested, both in vivo and in vitro, that some of the beneficial effects of LIF are mediated by modulation of the ECM. The effects of LIF in vivo on the amount and localisation of the ECM molecules, fibronectin, tenascin-C, collagen type IV and laminin were assessed by immunohistochemistry on regenerating skeletal muscle but no influence of LIF on ECM composition was observed. In tissue culture, LIF increased BALB/c myoblast proliferation at day 3 on culture dishes coated with Matrigel and also increased the viability in vitro of BALB/c myoblasts grown under suboptimal conditions. Quantitation of the ECM produced by cultures (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) showed that LIF affected the amount of fibronectin, tenascin-C, collagen type IV and laminin produced by fusing myoblasts. No significant affect of LIF was seen on myotube formation either in vitro or in vivo.

It is not clear whether cells choose one of them or use multiple processes when they commit to apoptosis. MOLT-4 cells undergo apoptosis after X-irradiation through the p53-dependent pathway and/or ceramide signal. To evaluate the relative contribution of these pathways, we studied effects of the expression of various levels of transfected murine mutant p53 cDNA (TGC-->CGC of codon 173, corresponding to codonl76 in human p53) on the induction of apoptosis in X-irradiated or heated MOLT-4 cells. When survival was determined by the dye-exclusion test at 24 h after irradiation, the percentage of X-ray- or heat-induced dead cells was markedly decreased, depending on the expression level of mutant p53 protein in transfected clones. The appearance of apoptotic cells as determined by morphological changes was also decreased. These inhibitions were almost complete at 24 h after irradiation with X-rays in the case of the highest-expressing clone. p21 WAF1 protein was increased in MOLT-4 cells after X-irradiation, but not in the transfectant. These results suggest that murine mutant p53 protein has a dominant-negative effect against normal p53 in MOLT-4, and that the X-ray-induced apoptosis in MOLT-4 is fully p53-dependent.","['Nakano, H', 'Kohara, M', 'Shinohara, K']","['Nakano H', 'Kohara M', 'Shinohara K']","['Department of Laboratory Animal Science, Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science, Japan. nakano@rinshoken.or.jp']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Germany,Cell Tissue Res,Cell and tissue research,0417625,,IM,"['Apoptosis/*genetics/*radiation effects', 'Gene Expression', '*Genes, p53', 'Hot Temperature', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*genetics/*pathology', '*Mutation', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/10/31 10:00,2002/04/24 10:01,['2001/10/31 10:00'],"['2001/10/31 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/04/24 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/31 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s004410100438 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Tissue Res. 2001 Oct;306(1):101-6. doi: 10.1007/s004410100438.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In preadipocytes, their expression is up-regulated by the activation of leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIF-R) and prostacyclin receptor (IP-R) via the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway and cAMP production, respectively. However, the molecular mechanisms by which LIF and prostacyclin-induced signals are propagated to the nucleus and the transcription factors mediating ERK and cAMP-induced C/EBP gene expression were unknown. Here we report that both pathways share cAMP responsive element binding protein/activation transcription factor 1 (CREB/ATF-1) as common downstream effectors. LIF-R and IP-R activation induced binding of CREB and/or ATF-1 to C/EBP promoters and CREB-dependent transcription. Expression of dominant negative forms of CREB dramatically reduced the LIF- and prostacyclin-stimulated C/EBP beta and C/EBP delta expression. Upon stimulation of the IP-R, the ERK pathway was activated in a PKA-dependent manner. ERK activation by the PKA pathway was not required for CREB/ATF-1 phosphorylation but rather was necessary for CREB-dependent up-regulation of C/EBPs expression.

Inflammatory cytokines, including leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), stimulate the HPA axis either directly at the pituitary corticotroph, or indirectly through induction of CRH or sympathetic noradrenergic neurons, and mediate the immuno-neuroendocrine interface. Unrestrained HPA axis activation leads, however, to immunosuppression. Because suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 (SOCS-3) is a potent inhibitor of LIF-activated HPA axis, and dynamic interactions between hypothalamus-derived cAMP-inducing neuropeptides and proinflammatory cytokines occur at the corticotroph level, we investigated SOCS-3 expression in response to peptides that stimulate cAMP including CRH, pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide, and epinephrine. (Bu)2cAMP mediates induction of SOCS-3 promoter activity (6.7-fold +/- 0.5, P < 0.001) and SOCS-3 gene expression (4-fold +/- 0.8, P < 0.005) in a PKA-dependent manner. LIF and cAMP-inducing agents are additive on SOCS-3 promoter activity (22-fold +/- 2.6, LIF + (Bu)2cAMP vs. 7.3-fold +/- 0.6, LIF alone, P < 0.05) and on SOCS-3 transcription (11.3-fold +/- 2.1, LIF + (Bu)2cAMP vs. 9.3-fold +/- 1, LIF alone, P < 0.05), suggesting alternate pathways for LIF and cAMP-mediated corticotroph signaling. Similarly, LIF and CRH or pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide are additive for SOCS-3 promoter activity and transcription (P < 0.05). Whereas signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 binding to the SOCS-3 promoter mediates LIF action, several SOCS-3 promoter regions containing cAMP-responsive elements are required for cAMP-PKA effect. Thus, both classes of POMC-inducing agents, cytokines as well as cAMP-inducing central peptides, regulate SOCS-3, providing a further level of negative HPA axis control during inflammation. These results indicate a sensitive intracellular autoregulation of corticotroph function.","['Bousquet, C', 'Chesnokova, V', 'Kariagina, A', 'Ferrand, A', 'Melmed, S']","['Bousquet C', 'Chesnokova V', 'Kariagina A', 'Ferrand A', 'Melmed S']","['Department of Medicine, Cedars-Sinai Research Institute-University of California Los Angeles School of Medicine, Los Angeles, California 90048, USA.']",['eng'],['R01-DK-50238/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Endocrinol,"Molecular endocrinology (Baltimore, Md.)",8801431,"['0 (Adcyap1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Neuropeptides)', '0 (Pituitary Adenylate Cyclase-Activating Polypeptide)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Socs3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 3 Protein)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '23583-48-4 (8-Bromo Cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate)', '63X7MBT2LQ (Bucladesine)', '66796-54-1 (Pro-Opiomelanocortin)', '9015-71-8 (Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'EC 2.7.11.11 (Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'YKH834O4BH (Epinephrine)']",IM,"['8-Bromo Cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Bucladesine/*pharmacology', 'Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone/pharmacology', 'Cyclic AMP/*metabolism', 'Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Epinephrine/pharmacology', 'Feedback, Physiological', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Growth Inhibitors/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Hypothalamus/metabolism', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Neuropeptides/*agonists/pharmacology', 'Pituitary Adenylate Cyclase-Activating Polypeptide', 'Pituitary-Adrenal System/metabolism', 'Pro-Opiomelanocortin/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Proteins/drug effects/genetics/*metabolism', '*Repressor Proteins', 'Response Elements', 'Signal Transduction', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 3 Protein', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins', '*Transcription Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/10/30 10:00,2002/03/22 10:01,['2001/10/30 10:00'],"['2001/10/30 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/22 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/30 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1210/mend.15.11.0733 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Endocrinol. 2001 Nov;15(11):1880-90. doi: 10.1210/mend.15.11.0733.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the precise cell biological mechanisms of this inhibition remained unknown. As shown in this study, apoptosis in human-derived HL-60 and U937 cells induced by treatment with actinomycin D or TNF-alpha in combination with cycloheximide, respectively, was indeed dose-dependently downregulated by prior infection with T. gondii, as determined by DNA fragmentation assays. Cleavage of caspase 3 and caspase 9 after treatment with pro-apoptotic stimuli was considerably diminished by T. gondii. Furthermore, release of mitochondrial cytochrome c during apoptosis in HL-60 cells was prevented by intracellular parasites and this was correlated with the absence of DNA strand breaks on the single cell level. Inhibition of cytochrome c release coincided with a twofold upregulation of Mcl-1 protein levels in HL-60 and U937 cells, while Bcl-2 expression did not increase after infection. Parasitic interference with the caspase cascade led to a reduced proteolytic cleavage of the nuclear target molecule protein kinase C delta. In parallel, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase protein levels were prominently downregulated by T. gondii, irrespective of whether HL-60 and U937 cells had been treated with pro-apototic stimuli or left untreated. However, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase mRNA levels remained unchanged after infection as determined by RT-PCR analyses. These observations suggest that T. gondii has evolved different mechanisms that may contribute to downregulation of host cell apoptosis, namely inhibition of cytochrome c release and subsequent caspase activation as well as downregulation of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase protein levels.","['Goebel, S', 'Gross, U', 'Luder, C G']","['Goebel S', 'Gross U', 'Luder CG']","['Department of Bacteriology, Georg-August-University Gottingen, Kreuzbergring 57, D-37075 Gottingen, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Cell Sci,Journal of cell science,0052457,"['0 (Cytochrome c Group)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Protein Synthesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspase 9', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Cytochrome c Group/metabolism', 'Dactinomycin/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Host-Parasite Interactions/physiology', 'Humans', 'Mitochondria/metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/*biosynthesis', 'Protein Synthesis Inhibitors/pharmacology', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'Signal Transduction/physiology', 'Toxoplasma/*physiology', 'Toxoplasmosis/*physiopathology', 'U937 Cells']",2001/10/30 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/10/30 10:00'],"['2001/10/30 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/30 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Cell Sci. 2001 Oct;114(Pt 19):3495-505.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A review of its preclinical anticancer properties.",159-73,"Vinflunine is a new Vinca alkaloid uniquely fluorinated, by the use of superacid chemistry, in a little exploited region of the catharanthine moiety. In vitro investigations have confirmed the mitotic-arresting and tubulin-interacting properties of vinflunine shared by other Vinca alkaloids. However, differences in terms of the inhibitory effects of vinflunine on microtubules dynamics and its tubulin binding affinities have been identified which appear to distinguish it from the other Vinca alkaloids. Vinflunine induced smaller spirals with a shorter relaxation time, effects, which might be associated with reduced neurotoxicity. Studies investigating the in vitro cytotoxicity of vinflunine in combination therapy have revealed a high level of synergy when vinflunine was combined with either cisplatin, mitomycin C, doxorubicin or 5-fluorouracil. Furthermore, although vinflunine appears to participate in P-glycoprotein-mediated drug resistance mechanisms, it has proved only a weak substrate for this protein and a far less potent inducer of resistance than vinorelbine. Vinflunine was identified in preclinical studies as having marked antitumour activity in vivo against a large panel of experimental tumour models, with tumour regressions being recorded in human renal and small cell lung cancer tumour xenografts. Overall its level of activity was superior to that of vinorelbine in many of the experimental models used. Interestingly, an in vivo study using a well vascularised adenocarcinoma of the colon has suggested that vinflunine mediates its antitumour activity at least in part via an antivascular mechanism, even at sub-cytotoxic doses. Therefore, these data provide a favourable preclinical profile for vinflunine, supporting its promising candidacy for clinical development. Phase I evaluations of vinflunine have been completed in Europe and phase II clinical trials are now ongoing.","['Kruczynski, A', 'Hill, B T']","['Kruczynski A', 'Hill BT']","['Division de Cancerologie Experimentale, Centre de Recherche Pierre Fabre, 17 avenue Jean Moulin, 81106 Cedex 06, Castres, France. anna.kruczynski@pierre-fabre.com']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,Crit Rev Oncol Hematol,Critical reviews in oncology/hematology,8916049,"['0 (Angiogenesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Tubulin Modulators)', '0 (Vinca Alkaloids)', '5BF646324K (vinflunine)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)']",IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/blood supply', 'Angiogenesis Inhibitors/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/administration & dosage/adverse effects/chemistry/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line/drug effects', 'Colonic Neoplasms/blood supply', 'DNA Damage', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Drug Synergism', 'Forecasting', 'Humans', 'Leukemia P388/drug therapy', 'Lung Neoplasms/drug therapy/prevention & control/secondary', 'Melanoma, Experimental/drug therapy/secondary', 'Mice', 'Microtubules/drug effects/ultrastructure', 'Molecular Structure', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*drug therapy', 'Nervous System Diseases/chemically induced', 'Tubulin Modulators', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Vinblastine/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives/chemistry/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Vinca Alkaloids/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2001/10/30 10:00,2002/02/15 10:01,['2001/10/30 10:00'],"['2001/10/30 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/02/15 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/30 10:00 [entrez]']","['S1040-8428(01)00183-4 [pii]', '10.1016/s1040-8428(01)00183-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Crit Rev Oncol Hematol. 2001 Nov;40(2):159-73. doi: 10.1016/s1040-8428(01)00183-4.,,68,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have screened several cellular factors known to play a role in adenovirus replication for their possible contributions to the interactions of Ad12 in the abortive BHK21 hamster cell system. (1) Western blot analyses of total protein extracts from Ad12- or Ad2-infected BHK21 cells do not reveal a significant difference in the accumulation of NFIII protein at different times after infection. Transcriptional levels of the NFIII gene in BHK21 cells are not altered upon the abortive infection with Ad12 or the productive infection with Ad2. The amount of NFIII protein is markedly reduced in nuclear extracts from BHK21 cells as compared with extracts from C131 hamster cells or human HeLa cells. A presumptive defect in NFIII transport to the nuclei rather than overall reduced NFIII gene transcription might explain the low abundance of NFIII in the nuclei of uninfected or Ad12-infected BHK21 cells. The productive infection of BHK21 or C131 cells with Ad2 leads to an increase in the NFIII concentration in the nuclei of infected cells, late after infection to a decrease; (2) NFI levels in the nuclei of mock-infected or Ad2- or Ad12-infected BHK21 cells are comparable with those in HeLa or in C131 cells. Thus, deficiencies in NFI may not play a role in the abortive system; (3) The absence of morphological alterations in PML protein domains from globular to track-like structures in the nuclei of Ad12-infected hamster cells correlates with the inability of Ad12 DNA to replicate in BHK21 cells. In BHK21 cells, the E4-ORF3 of Ad12 DNA is only weakly transcribed and only small amounts of the gene product are synthesized. In Ad12-infected C131 cells, which allow the replication of Ad12 DNA, the E4-ORF3 of Ad12 DNA is expressed, and track-like PML protein structures are observed. Transfection of the 12-E4-ORF3-EGFP construct leads to the expression of both the green fluorescent protein (GFP) and of the 12-E4-ORF3 gene product in 20-30% of the transfected BHK21 cells and elicits the morphological reorganization of the PML protein structures in the successfully transfected BHK21 cells. Similar results are obtained upon transfection of the 2-E4-ORF3 construct. Untransfected cells or cells transfected with the empty pIRES2-pEGFP vector carry the globular PML protein phenotype; (4) The expression of the 12-E4-ORF3-EGFP and/or of the NFIII-EGFP constructs upon transfection following Ad12-infection of BHK21 cells fails to promote Ad12 DNA replication. Hence, the formation of track-like PML protein structures in BHK21 cells by itself is not a sufficient precondition for Ad12 DNA replication in this abortive system. The data demonstrate that the expression of NFI, NFIII, and/or the conversion of the PML domains do not suffice to elicit Ad12 DNA replication in the abortive hamster cell system.","['Hosel, M', 'Schroer, J', 'Webb, D', 'Jaroshevskaja, E', 'Doerfler, W']","['Hosel M', 'Schroer J', 'Webb D', 'Jaroshevskaja E', 'Doerfler W']","['Institute for Genetics, University of Cologne, Weyertal 121, D-50931, Koeln, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Virus Res,Virus research,8410979,"['0 (Adenovirus E4 Proteins)', '0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (HCFC1 protein, human)', '0 (Host Cell Factor C1)', '0 (NFI Transcription Factors)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Octamer Transcription Factor-1)', '0 (POU2F1 protein, human)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (Y-Box-Binding Protein 1)', '0 (YBX1 protein, human)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)']",IM,"['Adenovirus E4 Proteins/genetics', 'Adenoviruses, Human/pathogenicity/*physiology', 'Animals', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cricetinae', 'DNA Replication/*physiology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'HeLa Cells', 'Host Cell Factor C1', 'Humans', 'Mesocricetus', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'NFI Transcription Factors', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*chemistry/genetics/metabolism', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Octamer Transcription Factor-1', 'Open Reading Frames/genetics', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Transcription Factors/*chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Y-Box-Binding Protein 1']",2001/10/30 10:00,2002/01/16 10:01,['2001/10/30 10:00'],"['2001/10/30 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/16 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/30 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0168170201002428 [pii]', '10.1016/s0168-1702(01)00242-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Virus Res. 2001 Dec 4;81(1-2):1-16. doi: 10.1016/s0168-1702(01)00242-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have tested this hypothesis using the CBA/H mouse model of radiation-induced acute myeloid leukaemia (r-AML). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) was employed to screen for chromosomal aberrations in mouse 3 Gy X-ray-induced r-AMLs and in the clonal descendents of control and 3 Gy X-irradiated bone marrow haemopoietic stem cells using the in vitro clonogenic CFU-A colony assay. RESULTS: High levels of clonal non-specific chromosomal aberrations were detected in the r-AML (approximately 4-5 aberrations/r-AML), and ongoing chromosomal instability as defined by subclonal variants detected in 5/10 r-AML. A similar analysis of CFU-A colonies revealed chromosomal aberrations in 25% of colonies derived from irradiated bone marrow (2% in controls). However, 66% of the aberrant colonies (2% in controls) exhibited ongoing genetic instability as defined by non-clonal chromosomal aberrations. Overall, 6% (121/1884) of the CFU-A cells derived from irradiated bone marrow were aberrant (0.05% in controls) of which 12% (15/121) were subclonal. No one CFU-A cell exhibited aberrations on more than one of the three chromosomes painted. CONCLUSIONS: The high levels of non-specific genetic damage observed in the r-AMLs is therefore attributed to the accumulation of genetic lesions in the target haemopoietic stem cell over a longer time-scale after exposure than assessed in the in vitro CFU-A clonogenic assay. This is consistent with the long latency of the multi-stage radiation leukaemogenic process, and a role for radiation-induced genetic instability is inferred.","['MacDonald, D', 'Boulton, E', 'Pocock, D', 'Goodhead, D', 'Kadhim, M', 'Plumb, M']","['MacDonald D', 'Boulton E', 'Pocock D', 'Goodhead D', 'Kadhim M', 'Plumb M']","['MRC Radiation and Genome Stability Unit, Chilton, Didcot, OXON, OX11 ORD, UK.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Int J Radiat Biol,International journal of radiation biology,8809243,,IM,"['Animals', '*Chromosome Aberrations', '*Chromosome Disorders', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*radiation effects/ultrastructure', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred CBA', 'X-Rays']",2001/10/30 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/10/30 10:00'],"['2001/10/30 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/30 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/09553000110073411 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Radiat Biol. 2001 Oct;77(10):1023-31. doi: 10.1080/09553000110073411.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unique biochemical properties of the biomolecule can, thus, be associated with photostable luminophores. This opens a general way to conjugate desired biomolecules using a sensitive signal transduction method. It also promotes the application of excellent luminescent materials, especially those based on photostable metalorganic luminophores, in biochemical analysis and biomolecular interaction studies. The conjugation method is based on uniform luminophore-doped silica (LDS) nanoparticles (63 +/- 4 nm). These nanoparticles have been prepared using a water-in-oil (W/O) microemulsion method. The controlled hydrolysis of tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) in W/O microemulsion leads to the formation of monodisperse LDS nanoparticles. The luminophores are doped inside the nanoparticles, and the particle's silica surfaces can be used to covalently bind with biomolecules. The luminophores are well-protected from the environmental oxygen when they are doped inside the silica network. As an example, we used an antibody for leukemia cell recognition. The antibody was first immobilized onto the luminophore-doped nanoparticle through silica chemistry and then was used for leukemia cell identification by an optical microscopy imaging technique. The leukemia cells were identified easily, clearly, and with high efficiency using these antibody-coated nanoparticles. The advantages of using small, uniform luminophore-doped nanoparticles are discussed.","['Santra, S', 'Zhang, P', 'Wang, K', 'Tapec, R', 'Tan, W']","['Santra S', 'Zhang P', 'Wang K', 'Tapec R', 'Tan W']","['Department of Chemistry and McKnight Brain Institute, The University of Florida, Gainesville 32611-7200, USA.']",['eng'],['NS39891-01/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Anal Chem,Analytical chemistry,0370536,"['0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Immunoconjugates)', '0 (Organometallic Compounds)', ""0 (tris(2,2'-bipyridyl)ruthenium(II))"", '7631-86-9 (Silicon Dioxide)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Neoplasm/chemistry', 'Biomarkers/analysis/*chemistry', 'Fluorescent Dyes/*chemistry', 'Humans', 'Immunoconjugates/chemistry', 'Leukemia/immunology', 'Luminescent Measurements', 'Organometallic Compounds/*chemistry', 'Particle Size', 'Photochemistry', 'Silicon Dioxide/*chemistry']",2001/10/30 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/10/30 10:00'],"['2001/10/30 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/30 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/ac010406+ [doi]'],ppublish,Anal Chem. 2001 Oct 15;73(20):4988-93. doi: 10.1021/ac010406+.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to determine its clinico-biological features and response to therapy we studied 33 patients (17%) out of 187 suffering from MCL who were diagnosed with a BV of MCL. Blastic variant was diagnosed according to histopathological patterns, immunophenotyping, and bcl1 gene rearrangement and/or cyclin D1 overexpression. Three patients initially diagnosed with large cell NHL were classified as BV. Patients received front-line therapy including CHOP-like regimen or CVP (n = 29), or chlorambucil (n = 4) and CHOP or ESAP as second-line therapy. High-dose intensification with stem cell transplantation (SCT) was performed in 11 cases (autoSCT, n = 8; alloSCT, n = 3). All but two patients were in complete remission (CR) at the time of transplant (CR1, n = 5; CR2, n = 4). Clinical and biological characteristics did not differ from those of the common form of MCL. The median age was 62 years (29-80), with a sex ratio (M/F) of 2.6:1. Of the 33 patients, 66% had extranodal site involvement, 85% had an Ann Arbor stage IV, and 82% had peripheral lymphadenopathy. Circulating lymphomatous cells were seen in 48% of cases. Twelve patients (36%) entered a CR1 with a median duration of 11 months. Fifteen patients (46%) failed to respond and rapidly died of progressive disease. Second-line therapy led to a 26% (6/23) CR2 rate. Nine patients relapsed after high-dose therapy. Twenty-two of the 33 patients (66%) died of refractory or progressive disease. Median overall survival (OS) time was 14.5 months for the 33 BV patients as compared to 53 months for the 154 patients with a common form of MCL, P <0.0001. In the univariate analysis, OS was influenced by age, extranodal site involvement, circulating lymphomatous cells, and international prognosis index (IPI). In the multivariate analysis, only IPI affected OS: patients with IPI > or =2 had 8 months median OS as compared to 36 months median OS for patients with IPI <2, P = 0.003. Blastic variant is one of the worst forms of NHL. An improved recognition of BV of MCL is required, particularly in high-grade CD5+ NHL using immunophenotyping and bcl1 molecular study. Standard therapy using anthracycline or even high-dose intensification produce poor results and an alternative treatment should be proposed to such patients.","['Bernard, M', 'Gressin, R', 'Lefrere, F', 'Drenou, B', 'Branger, B', 'Caulet-Maugendre, S', 'Tass, P', 'Brousse, N', 'Valensi, F', 'Milpied, N', 'Voilat, L', 'Sadoun, A', 'Ghandour, C', 'Hunault, M', 'Leloup, R', 'Mannone, L', 'Hermine, O', 'Lamy, T']","['Bernard M', 'Gressin R', 'Lefrere F', 'Drenou B', 'Branger B', 'Caulet-Maugendre S', 'Tass P', 'Brousse N', 'Valensi F', 'Milpied N', 'Voilat L', 'Sadoun A', 'Ghandour C', 'Hunault M', 'Leloup R', 'Mannone L', 'Hermine O', 'Lamy T']","['French GOELAMS Group, Grenoble.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Genes, bcl-1', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/*diagnosis/*mortality/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome']",2001/10/30 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/10/30 10:00'],"['2001/10/30 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/30 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2402272 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2001 Nov;15(11):1785-91. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402272.,,,,,,['Leukemia. 2002 Sep;16(9):1888-9; author reply 1889.

Cells infected with retrovirus or into which the env gene was introduced, become resistant to superinfection by other retroviruses with the same receptor specificity, a phenomenon known as receptor interference. We have demonstrated previously that the introduction of an env gene from a truncated endogenous ecotropic murine leukemia virus (MuLV), the Fv-4 resistance (Fv-4r) gene, into the bone marrow hematopoietic cells of Fv-4 sensitive (Fv-4s) mice protected mice from ecotropic retrovirus-induced disease. Using the gene transfer system under the control of the retroviral vector and bone marrow transplantation (BMT), here we could show that the expression of an introduced Fv-4r gene in hematopoietic cells continued for more than 1 year after BMT. To determine the inhibitory mechanism of Fv-4r env gene expression against FLV-infection in this model system, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), or spleen cells from chimeras with various degrees of env-expression, were mixed with green fluorescence protein (GFP)-conjugated Friend MuLV envglycoprotein (GFP-Fr-ENV). The amount of GFP-Fr-ENV bound to these cells inversely correlated with the expression intensity of the transduced env gene indicating the receptor interference effect. Next, to see whether transduction of the Fv-4r gene would protect an immunosuppressed host from FLV-induced leukemogenesis, we generated immunocompromised chimeras by transplanting env-transduced bone marrow cells into a thymectomized host. These chimeras also resisted FLV-induced leukemogenesis, indicating that receptor interference-based gene therapy could become a therapeutic basis for immunodeficiency virus-induced diseases in vivo.","['Kitagawa, M', 'Aizawa, S', 'Sado, T', 'Yamaguchi, S', 'Suzuki, T', 'Hirokawa, K', 'Ikeda, H']","['Kitagawa M', 'Aizawa S', 'Sado T', 'Yamaguchi S', 'Suzuki T', 'Hirokawa K', 'Ikeda H']","['Department of Pathology and Immunology, Aging and Developmental Sciences, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Graduate School, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Fv4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)']",IM,"['AIDS-Related Opportunistic Infections/*therapy', 'Animals', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/physiology', 'Gene Products, env/metabolism', '*Genes, env', 'Genetic Therapy/*methods', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/virology', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*therapy', 'Male', 'Membrane Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Retroviridae Infections/*therapy', 'Thymectomy', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Transplantation Chimera', 'Tumor Virus Infections/*therapy', '*Viral Interference']",2001/10/30 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/10/30 10:00'],"['2001/10/30 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/30 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2402279 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2001 Nov;15(11):1779-84. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402279.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These sequences were analyzed for targeting of specific motifs, ie certain highly mutable trinucleotides (3-NTPs), the tetranucleotide (4-NTP) RGYW and its complementary, WRCY (where R = purine, Y = pyrimidine and W = A or T). Comparisons were carried out between mutation frequencies in RGYW vs WRCY and the incidence of mutations in complementarity determining region (CDR)-1 vs CDR2 vs CDR3. Statistically significant differences were obtained when comparing: (1) the ratio of mutations in 4-NTPs (RGYW, WRCY, RGYW+WRCY)/mutations in the whole V sequence in MM-Vkappa vs MM-Vlamda; (2) the total number of mutated 4-NTPs in MM-Vkappa vs FL-Vkappa; (3) the number of mutated RGYW 4-NTPs in MM-Vkappa vs FL-Vkappa and FL-V(H) vs FL-Vkappa; (4) the number of mutated WRCY 4-NTPs in MM-Vkappa vs FL-Vkappa (P= 0.006) and FL-V(H) vs FL-Vkappa; (5) the targeting of RGYW vs WRCY in the CDRs of FL-V(H) genes. Similar results (regarding statistical significance) were obtained when undertaking intergroup comparisons for 3-NTPs. These findings conform well with relevant data derived from normal peripheral B cells. The differences observed in favor of 4-NTP (RGYW and WRCY) targeting in FL-V(H) vs FL-Vkappa and MM-Vkappa vs FL-Vkappa may implicate differences in the evolution of SHM coupled with selection in different stages of B cell ontogeny. Several explanations can be offered for the fact that hotspot sequences were not always targeted by SHM in FL and MM: (1) other unrecognized motifs may be targets of SHM; (2) 'inappropriately' introduced mutations were fixed and propagated by the neoplastic process; (3) certain FL and MM cases might have lost their ability to correct mutations introduced in classic hotspots due to deficient mismatch-repair (MMR) mechanisms; conversely, in other cases with intact MMR function, the hotspot to non-hotspot targeting of somatic hypermutation is balanced.","['Belessi, C', 'Stamatopoulos, K', 'Stavroyianni, N', 'Zoi, K', 'Papadaki, T', 'Kosmas, C']","['Belessi C', 'Stamatopoulos K', 'Stavroyianni N', 'Zoi K', 'Papadaki T', 'Kosmas C']","['Hematology Laboratory, General Hospital of Nikea, Piraeus, Greece.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Complementarity Determining Regions)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Light Chains)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Complementarity Determining Regions/*genetics', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', '*Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Light Chains/genetics', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Multiple Myeloma/*genetics', '*Mutation']",2001/10/30 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/10/30 10:00'],"['2001/10/30 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/30 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2402258 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2001 Nov;15(11):1772-8. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402258.,,,,,,,,,"['GENBANK/AJ410886', 'GENBANK/AJ410887', 'GENBANK/AJ410888', 'GENBANK/AJ410889', 'GENBANK/AJ410890', 'GENBANK/AJ410891', 'GENBANK/AJ410892', 'GENBANK/AJ410893', 'GENBANK/AJ410894', 'GENBANK/AJ410895', 'GENBANK/AJ410896', 'GENBANK/AJ410897', 'GENBANK/AJ410898', 'GENBANK/AJ410899', 'GENBANK/AJ410900', 'GENBANK/AJ410901', 'GENBANK/AJ410902', 'GENBANK/AJ410903', 'GENBANK/AJ410904', 'GENBANK/AJ410905', 'GENBANK/AJ410906', 'GENBANK/AJ410907', 'GENBANK/AJ410908', 'GENBANK/AJ410909', 'GENBANK/AJ410910', 'GENBANK/AJ410911', 'GENBANK/AJ410912', 'GENBANK/AJ410913', 'GENBANK/AJ410914', 'GENBANK/AJ410915', 'GENBANK/AJ410916', 'GENBANK/AJ410917', 'GENBANK/AJ410918', 'GENBANK/AJ410919', 'GENBANK/AJ410920', 'GENBANK/AJ410921', 'GENBANK/AJ410922']",,,,,,,,,,,

We reported previously negative data of MAGE-A1 gene expression in hematological malignancies, but in further studies positive results of MAGE-A gene expression were published in some subtypes of hematological malignancies such as T leukemia, myeloma and Hodgkin's disease. This led us to enlarge the screening of MAGE-A gene expression in human leukemias. In the RT-PCR screening of a large panel including 154 patients, only weak signal were detected in a few samples.

It was reported that a human B-precursor leukemic cell line was potently inhibited in its proliferation by one of synthetic PTK inhibitors (tyrphostins), AG490, via anti-JAK2 activity. However, no extensive studies about it have been performed. In the present study, we tested 16 human lymphoid leukemic cell lines (B-precursor, 12; T cell, four) for their sensitivity to AG490 using 3H-thymidine incorporation and colony formation assays, and found that B-precursor cell lines with 11q23 translocation or Philadelphia chromosome (Ph1) whose JAK2 proved to be constitutively phosphorylated were predominantly sensitive to AG490 at a concentration that has few inhibitory effect on normal hematopoiesis. We first revealed the association of JAK2 with BCR-ABL in Ph1-positive cell lines and with Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) in cell lines with 11q23 translocation by coimmunoprecipitation experiments. Of interest, AG490 markedly down-regulated phosphorylation of JAK2, but rather transiently up-regulated phosphorylation of BCR-ABL and BTK, suggesting direct implication of AG490 in the process of the JAK2 dephosphorylation. These results indicate that AG490 exerts a potent inhibitory activity to B-precursor leukemia with specific chromosomal abnormalities, and a therapeutic approach using AG490 is expected.","['Miyamoto, N', 'Sugita, K', 'Goi, K', 'Inukai, T', 'Lijima, K', 'Tezuka, T', 'Kojika, S', 'Nakamura, M', 'Kagami, K', 'Nakazawa, S']","['Miyamoto N', 'Sugita K', 'Goi K', 'Inukai T', 'Lijima K', 'Tezuka T', 'Kojika S', 'Nakamura M', 'Kagami K', 'Nakazawa S']","['Department of Pediatrics, Yamanashi Medical University, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Tyrphostins)', '0 (alpha-cyano-(3,4-dihydroxy)-N-benzylcinnamide)', '118409-62-4 (AG 127)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', 'DNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/genetics/metabolism/pathology', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Phosphorylation', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay', 'Tyrphostins/*pharmacology']",2001/10/30 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/10/30 10:00'],"['2001/10/30 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/30 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2402260 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2001 Nov;15(11):1758-68. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402260.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The goal of the present study was to examine the role of SHIP during proliferation and apoptosis in cells of the erythroid lineage. Wild-type and catalytically inactive SHIP proteins were overexpressed in the erythropoietin (EPO)-dependent cell line AS-E2. Stable overexpression of catalytically inactive SHIP decreased proliferation and resulted in prolonged activation of the extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases ERK1/2 and protein kinase B (PKB), while wild-type SHIP did not affect EPO-mediated proliferation or phosphorylation of ERK and PKB. When AS-E2 cells were EPO deprived a significant increase in apoptosis was observed in clones overexpressing wild type. Mutational analysis showed that this increase in apoptosis was independent of the enzymatic activity of SHIP. The enhanced apoptosis due to overexpression of SHIP was associated with an increase in caspase-3 and -9 activity, without a distinct effect on caspase-8 activity or mitochondrial depolarization. Moreover, in cells overexpressing SHIP apoptosis could be reduced by a caspase-3 inhibitor. These data demonstrate that in the erythroid cell line AS-E2 overexpression of catalytically inactive SHIP reduced proliferation, while overexpression of wild-type SHIP had no effect. Furthermore, overexpression of SHIP enhanced apoptosis during growth factor deprivation by inducing specific caspase cascades, which are regulated independently of the 5-phosphatase activity of SHIP.","['Boer, A K', 'Drayer, A L', 'Vellenga, E']","['Boer AK', 'Drayer AL', 'Vellenga E']","['Department of Medicine, University Hospital Groningen, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.3.2 (Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.1.3.86 (INPPL1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.86 (Phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-Trisphosphate 5-Phosphatases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspase 9', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Division', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/*cytology/enzymology', 'Erythropoietin/physiology', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Mutation', 'Phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-Trisphosphate 5-Phosphatases', 'Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases/genetics/*physiology', 'Phosphorylation', '*Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/10/30 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/10/30 10:00'],"['2001/10/30 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/30 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2402261 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2001 Nov;15(11):1750-7. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402261.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Targets of murine Mll include HOX proteins that regulate body pattern formation and hematopoiesis. However, it is not known whether or not the MLL chimeric proteins regulate the HOX gene expression in human leukemia. To address this issue, THP-1 cells, a human leukemia cell line expressing MLL-AF9, were treated with antisense oligodeoxyribonucleotide (ODN) complementary to the coding sequence of the MLL-AF9 junction. Down-regulation of the MLL-AF9 transcript was accompanied by the reduced expression of the HOXA7 and -A10 genes, but not of the HOXA2, -A4, -A5, and -A9 genes. The number of viable cells cultured with 20 microM antisense ODN for 5 days was 10-fold lower than that of the sense ODN-treated control. And the number of the annexin V-/propidium iodide- apoptotic cells in the antisense ODN-treated cells after 3 days of culture was two-fold higher than that in the control. Staining of the antisense ODN-treated cells with Hoechst 33258 showed the morphology characteristic to apoptosis.

In the present study, we show that resveratrol, as well as the hydroxylated analog piceatannol, are potent inducers of apoptotic cell death in BJAB Burkitt-like lymphoma cells with an ED50 concentration of 25 microM. Further experiments revealed that treatment of BJAB cells with both substances led to a concentration-dependent activation of caspase-3 and mitochondrial permeability transition. Using BJAB cells overexpressing a dominant-negative mutant of the Fas-associated death domain (FADD) adaptor protein to block death receptor-mediated apoptosis, we demonstrate that resveratrol- and piceatannol-induced cell death in these cells is independent of the CD95/Fas signaling pathway.

There are at least six major isotypes of p51/p63 mRNA transcripts. p51A/TAp63gamma has the potential to induce apoptosis and growth suppression in a manner similar to p53, and other isotypes may suppress the p53 and p51A1TAp63gamma genes in a dominant-negative manner. We analyzed the mutation and expression of the p51/p63 gene in 80 cases of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) to evaluate its role in blastic transformation. Expression of the p51/p63 gene was detected in 74 cases. The alpha isotype of p51/p63 transcripts was dominantly expressed in 72 of these 74 cases. There was no correlation between the isotypes of p51/p63 transcripts and the clinical phase. Mutations of the p51/p63 gene were found in six cases. All these mutated cases expressed p51B/TAp63 alpha. In four of the six cases, the mutations were within a limited region (codon 151-170) corresponding to the DNA-binding domain. We hypothesized that this limited region is a hot spot for mutation of the p51/p63 gene. Mutations of the p53 gene were found in four cases of CML in blastic crisis (BC). Frequencies of the p51/p63 and p53 gene mutations were higher in BC (p51/p63 gene, 11.8%; p53 gene, 7.8%) than in the chronic phase (p51/p63 gene, 1.5%; p53 gene, 0%).

A pilot study.,1696-700,"All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), alone or combined with chemotherapy (CHT) is widely used to induce complete remission (CR) in newly diagnosed acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). If used alone, ATRA results in a substantial proportion of CRs. To maintain remission further, ATRA is commonly used with cycles of CHT, frequently followed by autologous (auto) or allogeneic (allo) stem cell transplantation (SCT), as early reports have shown that the continuous administration of ATRA as single therapy almost invariably leads to relapse in a short period of time (months). Pharmacokinetic studies have shown that induced resistance to ATRA is frequently suppressed by the intermittent use of the drug. In this study we applied an intermittent therapeutic protocol with ATRA in five APL patients who were either molecularly refractory after combined ATRA/CHT treatment, or relapsed, or at diagnosis, but not eligible for the combination treatment because of previous toxicity. They were treated with ATRA (45 mg/m2/day) for 21 days. The treatment was then prolonged continuously for 1 week every 2 weeks. Molecular analysis was performed by qualitative and quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). All patients obtained molecular remission, as assessed by qualitative RT-PCR, in a median of 3 months (range 1-15). Quantitative RT-PCR confirmed these data, showing a progressive reduction (1 or 2 logs) to a 'negligible quantity' of PML-RARalpha fusion transcript (ratio PML-RARalpha/ABL x 10(4) ABL < 10(-1)) in all but one patient treated with pulsed ATRA therapy. These data were confirmed with qualitative and quantitative RT-PCR. After a median follow-up of 17 months from the start of ATRA therapy, 4/5 patients (80%) are in continuous complete molecular remission. To our knowledge, this is the first clinical observation that intermittent ATRA therapy (without chemotherapy) is effective not only in inducing but also in maintaining long-term molecular remission in APL patients. This approach could therefore be effective, if confirmed in larger series, in relapsed/refractory patients unsuitable for high-dose therapy and SCT; it may be proposed as induction therapy for selected older APL patients if considered not to be eligible for combined ATRA/CHT due to inadequate performance status or concurrent disease.","['Visani, G', 'Buonamici, S', 'Malagola, M', 'Isidori, A', 'Piccaluga, P P', 'Martinelli, G', 'Ottaviani, E', 'Grafone, T', 'Baccarani, M', 'Tura, S']","['Visani G', 'Buonamici S', 'Malagola M', 'Isidori A', 'Piccaluga PP', 'Martinelli G', 'Ottaviani E', 'Grafone T', 'Baccarani M', 'Tura S']","['Department of Hematology, Azienda Ospedale San Salvatore, Pesaro, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Pilot Projects', 'RNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Remission Induction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tretinoin/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use']",2001/10/30 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/10/30 10:00'],"['2001/10/30 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/30 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2402266 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2001 Nov;15(11):1696-700. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402266.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Molecular analysis of the genes involved in these translocations has led to a better understanding of both the causes of chromosomal rearrangements as well as the mechanisms of leukemic transformation. Recently, a number of laboratories have cloned translocations involving the NUP98 gene on chromosome 11p15.5, from patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), and T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). To date, at least eight different chromosomal rearrangements involving NUP98 have been identified. The resultant chimeric transcripts encode fusion proteins that juxtapose the N-terminal GLFG repeats of NUP98 to the C-terminus of the partner gene. Of note, several of these translocations have been found in patients with therapy-related acute myelogenous leukemia (t-AML) or myelodysplastic syndrome (t-MDS), suggesting that genotoxic chemotherapeutic agents may play an important role in generating chromosomal rearrangements involving NUP98.","['Lam, D H', 'Aplan, P D']","['Lam DH', 'Aplan PD']","['Department of Immunology, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, NY, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (nuclear pore complex protein 98)']",IM,"['Artificial Gene Fusion', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Models, Biological', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/genetics', 'Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins/chemistry/*genetics/physiology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/*physiology', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', '*Translocation, Genetic']",2001/10/30 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/10/30 10:00'],"['2001/10/30 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/30 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2402269 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2001 Nov;15(11):1689-95. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402269.,,82,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One is ABVD therapy for Hodgkin's lymphoma, and the other is CHOP therapy for aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). In these regimens as well as the regimen for breast cancer, doxorubicin is delivered by bolus intravenous infusion for 30 minutes to one hour. The use of continuous infusion schedules of doxorubicin for 72 to 96 hours has been reported to reduce the incidence of cardiac toxicity somewhat, providing a pharmacokinetic basis for the hypothesis that high peak concentrations are associated with an increased incidence of cardiotoxicity. VAD regimen for myeloma, and EPOCH regimen for relapsed aggressive NHL have been reported and used. However, this approach is not widespread because of concern over compromising antitumor efficacy, unpredictable toxicities, and logistical issues.

To further lower the risk of serious and long-lasting infections by additional supportive measures, detailed information on the frequency and characteristic features of infections is needed. Therefore, patient data from 112 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and T-cell lymphoma who were treated according to the COALL-05-92 protocol in our department were analyzed for differences in the frequency and origin of febrile episodes in relation to age, immunological type of leukemia, treatment in group assessed as being at high or low risk of relapse, actual occurrence of relapse, and course of chemotherapy. At the time of diagnosis, low-risk patients more commonly presented with febrile episodes than high-risk patients. In total, patients developed a fever in 313 (24%) of 1,307 evaluated chemotherapy cycles. Febrile episodes were associated with microbiologically or clinically documented infections in 60% of all cases, while in 40% the fever was of unknown origin. Gram-positive pathogens had a markedly higher incidence than gram-negative or fungal ones. The incidence of febrile episodes during therapy appeared to be correlated with certain chemotherapeutic drug combinations. The highest rate was found after high-dose cytarabine and asparaginase causing a long period of leukopenia. However, after other chemotherapy courses with a similar duration of leukopenia the incidence of febrile episodes was significantly lower, suggesting that specific interactions of different chemotherapeutic agents with the immune response might be an important factor in development of infections. Individual factors might also account for an increased incidence of infections, since the number of high-risk patients with recurrent infections was significantly higher than expected on the basis of statistical evaluation. In conclusion, our findings suggest that the risk of infections during chemotherapy may not only be influenced by leukopenia, but that drug-specific effects of the various chemotherapeutic agents and individual factors may also be important contributory factors. These observations must be further expanded in prospective studies so that new tailored supportive care protocols can be elaborated.","['Lex, C', 'Korholz, D', 'Kohlmuller, B', 'Bonig, H', 'Willers, R', 'Kramm, C M', 'Gobel, U']","['Lex C', 'Korholz D', 'Kohlmuller B', 'Bonig H', 'Willers R', 'Kramm CM', 'Gobel U']","[""Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Children's Hospital, Heinrich Heine University of Dusseldorf, Germany.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Support Care Cancer,Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer,9302957,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Chi-Square Distribution', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infections/*complications/epidemiology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/*complications/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Neutropenia/complications', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications/drug therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Analysis']",2001/10/30 10:00,2002/02/22 10:01,['2001/10/30 10:00'],"['2001/10/30 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/02/22 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/30 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s005200100248 [doi]'],ppublish,Support Care Cancer. 2001 Oct;9(7):514-21. doi: 10.1007/s005200100248.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It binds to the ATP-binding site of the target kinase and prevents the transfer of phosphate from ATP to the tyrosine residues of various substrates. At oral doses of 300 mg or greater, the vast majority of patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia achieve a haematological response and this is usually associated with limited toxicity. Imatinib also has substantial activity in Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukaemia expressing the BCR-ABL fusion protein. Gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GISTs) have also been evaluated for clinical activity of imatinib. About 90% of malignant GISTs harbour a mutation in c-kit leading to KIT receptor autophosphorylation and ligand-independent activation. According to initial clinical studies, more than 50% of GISTs respond to therapy within a few months, and only about 10-15% progress. The potential for cure and the optimal length of treatment are currently not known. Several other human cancers may over-express KIT or PDGF-R, and clinical trials to evaluate the role of imatinib in the treatment of such cancers are currently ongoing. Imatinib is an example of a specifically designed, highly targeted cancer therapy, which poses novel requirements for both pathology laboratories and clinicians in terms of identifying the major molecular mechanisms involved in tumour growth.","['Joensuu, H', 'Dimitrijevic, S']","['Joensuu H', 'Dimitrijevic S']",,['eng'],,['Editorial'],England,Ann Med,Annals of medicine,8906388,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Benzamides', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Gastrointestinal Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diagnosis/*drug therapy', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Treatment Outcome']",2001/10/30 10:00,2002/01/30 10:01,['2001/10/30 10:00'],"['2001/10/30 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/30 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/30 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/07853890109002093 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Med. 2001 Oct;33(7):451-5. doi: 10.3109/07853890109002093.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Based upon phase I data generated by the Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) indicating that doxorubicin at a dose of 120 mg/m(2) when combined with dexrazoxane and GM-CSF could be safely administered, the CALGB undertook a phase II study of high-dose doxorubicin in patients with malignant mesothelioma.

The etiology of this excess risk is unclear, and has been thought to be related to smoking. HER-2/neu overexpression has evolved as a prognostic/predictive factor in some solid tumors. We reviewed our experience with non-smokers who had CLL and subsequently developed lung carcinoma, in an effort to better understand the clinical course of these patients, and to evaluate the role of HER-2/neu overexpression. We reviewed the records of all patients who had a diagnosis of both CLL and lung carcinoma between 1986 and 2000. HER-2/neu overexpression was estimated by immunohistochemistry (IHC) using the Hercep test (DAKO). An IHC score of 2+ or greater was considered positive. Overall survival was calculated from the date of diagnosis of lung carcinoma by the Kaplan-Meier product limit method. Fourteen non-smokers in whom a diagnosis of CLL was made at least 6 months prior to the diagnosis of lung carcinoma were identified. The median age for diagnosis of CLL in this group was 67 years while that for lung carcinoma was 70 years. The lung carcinomas included 10 non-small cell (NSCLC) and four small cell (SCLC) carcinomas. Nine specimens (six NSCLC and three SCLC) showed HER-2/neu overexpression. Interestingly, 90% of patients with advanced stage cancer (stage IIIB/IV NSCLC or extensive SCLC) overexpressed HER-2/neu. The presence of CLL did not alter outcome in patients with early stage lung cancer. However, after adjustment for age and performance status, patients with advanced stage NSCLC and CLL had a worse than expected outcome. HER-2/neu overexpression (independent of smoking) may be involved in the development/progression of lung cancer in patients with CLL, and has an associated worse outcome. It is appropriate to consider heightened surveillance of CLL patients for lung carcinoma.","['Potti, A', 'Ganti, A K', 'Koch, M', 'Mehdi, S A', 'Levitt, R']","['Potti A', 'Ganti AK', 'Koch M', 'Mehdi SA', 'Levitt R']","['Department of Medicine, University of North Dakota School of Medicine, Fargo, ND 58102, USA. apotti@medicine.nodak.edu']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Ireland,Lung Cancer,"Lung cancer (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",8800805,"['EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, ErbB-2)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genes, erbB-2/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*pathology', 'Lung Neoplasms/*genetics/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*genetics/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Receptor, ErbB-2/*biosynthesis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Analysis']",2001/10/27 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/10/27 10:00'],"['2001/10/27 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/27 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0169-5002(01)00241-0 [pii]', '10.1016/s0169-5002(01)00241-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Lung Cancer. 2001 Nov;34(2):227-32. doi: 10.1016/s0169-5002(01)00241-0.,,,,,,['Lung Cancer. 2005 Dec;50(3):419-20.

Half the vaccinated animals remained PCR negative after challenge, whereas the remaining half and the placebo group became PCR positive within 4 weeks postchallenge (Hislop AD, Good MF, Mateo L, Gardner J, Gatei MH, Daniel RCW, Meyers BV, Lavin MF, and Suhrbier A: Nat Med 1998;4:1193). Here we show that neither epitope mutations nor processing differences explained why half the peptide-vaccinated animals failed to resist the BLV challenge. However, in these animals the development of BLV-induced lymphosarcomas was significantly delayed compared with the placebo group, suggesting a role for CTLs in preventing retrovirus-induced cancers. Importantly, two of the initially protected animals become PCR positive after approximately 1.5 years, indicating extended suppression but not elimination of challenge virus by vaccine-induced CTLs. The late emergence of virus could not be explained by epitope escape mutations or the loss of memory CTL responses. We speculate that high levels of effector CTL may be needed to protect animals from a postchallenge viremia and maintenance of such effector CTLs, rather than memory CTLs, may be required to prevent subsequent emergence of virus from latent pools.","['Mateo, L', 'Gardner, J', 'Suhrbier, A']","['Mateo L', 'Gardner J', 'Suhrbier A']","['Australian National Centre for International and Tropical Health and Nutrition, Queensland Institute of Medical Research and the University of Queensland, Post Office Royal Brisbane Hospital, Queensland 4029, Australia.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses,AIDS research and human retroviruses,8709376,"['0 (Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Vaccines, Synthetic)', '0 (Viral Vaccines)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cattle', 'Disease Progression', 'Enzootic Bovine Leukosis/immunology/prevention & control/*virology', 'Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte/immunology', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/*immunology/isolation & purification', 'Mutagenesis', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Sheep', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology', 'Time Factors', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccines, Synthetic/*immunology', 'Viral Vaccines/*immunology']",2001/10/27 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/10/27 10:00'],"['2001/10/27 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/27 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/088922201753197114 [doi]'],ppublish,AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses. 2001 Oct 10;17(15):1447-53. doi: 10.1089/088922201753197114.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In an attempt to improve the results of HLA-identical sibling BMT, we investigated the effect of accelerating hemopoietic reconstitution and reducing acute GVHD (aGVHD) in allo-BMT receiving G-CSF-stimulated donor marrow and the preliminary biological mechanism. The donors of 30 patients (study group) with leukemia were given G-CSF 3-4 microg/kg/d for 7 doses prior to marrow harvest. The results of subsequent engraftment in the recipients were compared with those of 18 patients without G-CSF (control group). Five donors themselves were studied to assess the effects of G-CSF on the hematopoietic progenitor cells and lymphocyte subsets in the bone marrow (BM). We observed that the stimulated BM yielded higher numbers of nucleated cells as well as CFU-GM and CD34+ cells (p<0.01), and that hemopoietic reconstitution was accelerated. The median number of days of granulocyte count exceeding 0.5x10(9)/L and platelet count exceeding 20x10(9)/L was 16 (range 10-23 d) and 18.5 (range 13-31 d), respectively (control group: median 22 d, range 13-29 d and median 23 d, range 17-34 d; p=0.001). The incidence of grade II-IV severe aGVHD was very low, with only 1 case (3.3%) with acute grade II aGVHD limited to the skin in the study group. Five of 18 patients in the control group manifested grade II-IV severe aGVHD (27.8%, p=0.02). The number of T-lymphocyte subsets in the harvested BM using G-CSF stimulation was changed. In the G-CSF-stimulated marrow group, CD4+ decreased and CD8+ increased significantly (p=0.02). The changes of progenitor cells and T-lymphocyte subsets in donors' BM from pre- and post-G-CSF stimulation showed that the percentage of CD4+ reduced (p=0.04) and that of CD8+ increased (p=0.06), while that of CD34+ also increased (p=0.002). The incidence of chronic GVHD and relapse had no significant difference between both groups. These results indicate that allo-BMT in BM G-CSF priming can accelerate engraftment and minimize the incidence of severe aGVHD.

We have demonstrated that CD4+ T cells containing both serine esterase and perforin (PF) are increased in the blood of these patients. Using flow cytometry, we have shown that the CD4+ PF+ cells were CD57+ but lacked expression of CD28, suggesting a mature population. The same phenotype in CD8+ T cells is characteristic of mature cytotoxic T cells. However, in contrast to the CD8+ T cells, the CD4+ T cells were more frequently CD45RO positive than CD45RA positive, indicating prior antigen experience. In contrast, this population lacked expression of either CD69 or HLA-DR, arguing that they were not activated or that they are an abnormal population of T cells. Their constitutive cytokine levels showed them mainly to contain IL4 and not IFNgamma, suggesting a Th2 phenotype. The role of the CD4+ PF+ T-cell population is at present uncertain.

Cytotoxicity was significantly reduced by blocking with anti-HLA class II (P = 0.001), anti-TCRalphabeta (P = 0.03) and anti-CD4 (P = 0.046) antibodies. Phenotyping of the responding T-cell population demonstrated the majority to be CD4 positive.

METHODS: Forty children with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukaemia received Erwinia asparaginase (30 000 IU/m2 i.v. or i.m.) during induction therapy (every day for 10 days), and 19 children received Erwinia asparaginase (30 000 IU/m2 i.v. or i.m.) during re-induction therapy (twice a week for 2 weeks). Within the treatment periods asparaginase trough activity (using a spectrophotometric assay) was determined on specific days. The goal of therapy is complete L-asparagine depletion, which asparaginase activities above 100 IU l(-1) have been shown to ensure. Therefore determination of L-asparagine (using a h.p.l.c. method) was performed only in plasma samples with asparaginase activities below 100 IU l(-1). RESULTS: During induction therapy 92.2% of the trough enzyme activities were above 500 IU l(-1) for the i.v.-treated patients, and 92.4% of the trough enzyme activities were above 500 IU l(-1) for the i.m.-treated patients. During re-induction therapy 64.7% of the trough enzyme activities were below 100 IU l(-1) in the i.v.-treated group, and 73.3% of the trough enzyme activities were below 100 IU l(-1) in the i.m.-treated group. For trough enzyme activities below 100 IU l(-1) L-asparagine depletion was complete in two thirds of the samples. CONCLUSIONS: In the NOPHO-92 ALL-protocol L-asparaginase treatment during induction therapy was unnecessarily intense, but during the re-induction phase it appeared inadequate.","['Albertsen, B K', 'Schroder, H', 'Jakobsen, P', 'Muller, H J', 'Carlsen, N T', 'Schmiegelow, K']","['Albertsen BK', 'Schroder H', 'Jakobsen P', 'Muller HJ', 'Carlsen NT', 'Schmiegelow K']","['Centre for Clinical Pharmacology, University of Aarhus, Aarhus, Denmark. bka@farm.au.dk']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Clin Pharmacol,British journal of clinical pharmacology,7503323,"['7006-34-0 (Asparagine)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Asparaginase/administration & dosage/metabolism/*therapeutic use', 'Asparagine/*blood', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Injections, Intramuscular', 'Injections, Intravenous', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Scandinavian and Nordic Countries']",2001/10/27 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/10/27 10:00'],"['2001/10/27 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/27 10:00 [entrez]']","['1464 [pii]', '10.1046/j.0306-5251.2001.01464.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Clin Pharmacol. 2001 Oct;52(4):433-7. doi: 10.1046/j.0306-5251.2001.01464.x.,,,,,PMC2014586,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On the contrary, chromium (III) salts such as chromium polynicotinate, chromium chloride and chromium picolinate, are used as micronutrients and nutritional supplements, and have been demonstrated to exhibit a significant number of health benefits in rodents and humans. However, the cause for the hexavalent chromium to induce cytotoxicity is not entirely understood. A series of in vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated that chromium (VI) induces an oxidative stress through enhanced production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) leading to genomic DNA damage and oxidative deterioration of lipids and proteins. A cascade of cellular events occur following chromium (VI)-induced oxidative stress including enhanced production of superoxide anion and hydroxyl radicals, increased lipid peroxidation and genomic DNA fragmentation, modulation of intracellular oxidized states, activation of protein kinase C, apoptotic cell death and altered gene expression. In this paper, we have demonstrated concentration- and time-dependent effects of sodium dichromate (chromium (VI) or Cr (VI)) on enhanced production of superoxide anion and hydroxyl radicals, changes in intracellular oxidized states as determined by laser scanning confocal microscopy, DNA fragmentation and apoptotic cell death (by flow cytometry) in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. These results were compared with the concentration-dependent effects of chromium (VI) on chronic myelogenous leukemic K562 cells and J774A.1 murine macrophage cells. Chromium (VI)-induced enhanced production of ROS, as well as oxidative tissue and DNA damage were observed in these cells. More pronounced effect was observed on chronic myelogenous leukemic K562 cells and J774A.1 murine macrophage cells. Furthermore, we have assessed the effect of a single oral LD50 dose of chromium (VI) on female C57BL/6Ntac and p53-deficient C57BL/6TSG p53 mice on enhanced production of superoxide anion, lipid peroxidation and DNA fragmentation in the hepatic and brain tissues. Chromium (VI)-induced more pronounced oxidative damage in p53 deficient mice. This in vivo study highlighted that apoptotic regulatory protein p53 may play a major role in chromium (VI)-induced oxidative stress and toxicity. Taken together, oxidative stress and oxidative tissue damage, and a cascade of cellular events including modulation of apoptotic regulatory gene p53 are involved in chromium (VI)-induced toxicity and carcinogenesis.","['Bagchi, D', 'Bagchi, M', 'Stohs, S J']","['Bagchi D', 'Bagchi M', 'Stohs SJ']","['Creighton University School of Pharmacy and Allied Health Professions, Omaha, NE 68178, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Mol Cell Biochem,Molecular and cellular biochemistry,0364456,"['0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (Cytochrome c Group)', '0 (Tetrazolium Salts)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0R0008Q3JB (Chromium)', '11062-77-4 (Superoxides)', '18540-29-9 (chromium hexavalent ion)', '3352-57-6 (Hydroxyl Radical)', 'EUY85H477I (thiazolyl blue)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Carcinogens/toxicity', 'Cell Line', 'Chromium/metabolism/*toxicity', 'Cytochrome c Group/metabolism', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects/physiology', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyl Radical/metabolism', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', 'Lipid Peroxidation/drug effects/physiology', 'Macrophages/drug effects/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Oxidative Stress/*drug effects/physiology', 'Superoxides/metabolism', 'Tetrazolium Salts/metabolism', 'Thiazoles/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/drug effects/*genetics']",2001/10/27 10:00,2002/03/19 10:01,['2001/10/27 10:00'],"['2001/10/27 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/19 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/27 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Mol Cell Biochem. 2001 Jun;222(1-2):149-58.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Serum TPO levels were measured by the quantitative sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Quantikine, RD Systems). At the start of the induction chemotherapy, the patients had a median serum TPO level of 199 pg/ml (range 120-2,150 pg/ml), while 10 to 12 days after the end of chemotherapy, their TPO levels were substantially increased, the median value being 1,907 pg/ml (range 1,049-4,194 pg/ml). The correlation between PC and TPO was statistically significant prior to chemotherapy (p < 0.03) and insignificant after chemotherapy. As a result of chemotherapy, the patients developed aplasia; after the administration of platelet transfusions, their median PC increased to 21 x 10(9)/l (range 5-55 x 10(9)/l), while the median TPO value decreased by 300 pg/ml (range 11-1,125 pg/ml). Our results suggest that platelet mass directly regulates serum TPO levels in acute leukaemia patients prior to chemotherapy and after the administration of platelet transfusions. Serum TPO levels may also be influenced by the cytokine response during complicating infections in patients with chemotherapy-induced cytopenia.","['Cernelc, P', 'Kralj, J', 'Mlakar, U', 'Andoljsek, D', 'Modic, M', 'Pretnar, J', 'Zupan, I', 'Zver, S']","['Cernelc P', 'Kralj J', 'Mlakar U', 'Andoljsek D', 'Modic M', 'Pretnar J', 'Zupan I', 'Zver S']","['Department of Haematology, University Medical Centre, Ljubljana, Slovenia.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Germany,Pflugers Arch,Pflugers Archiv : European journal of physiology,0154720,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '9014-42-0 (Thrombopoietin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/*blood/drug therapy', 'Platelet Count', 'Platelet Transfusion', 'Thrombocytopenia/chemically induced/therapy', 'Thrombopoietin/*blood']",2001/10/27 10:00,2002/03/22 10:01,['2001/10/27 10:00'],"['2001/10/27 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/22 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/27 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s004240100024 [doi]'],ppublish,Pflugers Arch. 2001;442(6 Suppl 1):R200-1. doi: 10.1007/s004240100024.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Growth and function of these cells are controlled by a variety of cytokines, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). We analysed the effects of novel tyrosine kinase inhibitors targeting the VEGF and PDGF receptors (compounds SU5614 and SU5768) on the performance of long-term cultures from normal human bone marrow. In developing cultures, the inhibitors induced a dose-dependent reduction in stromal fibroblasts, macrophages and endothelial cells with a concomitant decrease in blood cell production and an increase in fat cells. For SU5614, the concentration inhibiting stroma formation by 50% (IC50) was 123nM, and the IC50 for haemopoietic colony forming cell output was 186 nM. For SU5768, the respective values were 871 nM and 331 nM. Changes in stroma composition and inhibition of haemopoietic cell production were also demonstrable after delayed addition of the inhibitors to established cultures. By contrast, haemopoietic colony formation in clonogenic agar cultures was unimpaired (IC50 not reached at 100 microM). Immunofluorescence studies and time course analyses suggested that the primary effect of the inhibitors was interference with the proliferation and function of fibroblasts and endothelial cells which in turn resulted in decreased haemopoiesis and increased adipogenesis. This was associated with decreased levels in conditioned media of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, interleukin-6 and leptin. VEGF and PDGF may play a hitherto underestimated role in the control of blood cell formation. VEGF/PDGF receptor inhibitors may have therapeutic potential in stroma diseases such as myelofibrosis. Since they weaken the stimulatory signals provided by the microenvironment, they may also be of value in the treatment of leukaemia and other neoplastic bone marrow diseases.","['Duhrsen, U', 'Martinez, T', 'Vohwinkel, G', 'Ergun, S', 'Sun, L', 'McMahon, G', 'Durig, J', 'Hossfeld, D K', 'Fiedler, W']","['Duhrsen U', 'Martinez T', 'Vohwinkel G', 'Ergun S', 'Sun L', 'McMahon G', 'Durig J', 'Hossfeld DK', 'Fiedler W']","['Zentrum fur Innere Medizin, Abteilung fur Hamatologie, Universitatsklinikum Essen, Germany. ulrich.duehrsen@uni-essen.de']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Growth Factors,"Growth factors (Chur, Switzerland)",9000468,"['0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (Endothelial Growth Factors)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Platelet-Derived Growth Factor)', '0 (Receptors, Growth Factor)', '0 (SU 5614)', '0 (SU 5768)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptors, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptors, Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor)']",IM,"['Adipocytes/cytology/drug effects', 'Animals', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Culture Media, Conditioned/analysis', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Endothelial Growth Factors/metabolism', 'Endothelium, Vascular/cytology/drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Erythropoiesis/drug effects', 'Fibroblasts/cytology/drug effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Indoles/*pharmacology', 'Lymphokines/metabolism', 'Macrophages/cytology/drug effects', 'Mice', 'Platelet-Derived Growth Factor/metabolism', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Receptors, Growth Factor/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Receptors, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Receptors, Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor', 'Time Factors', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors']",2001/10/27 10:00,2002/04/24 10:01,['2001/10/27 10:00'],"['2001/10/27 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/04/24 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/27 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/08977190109001072 [doi]'],ppublish,Growth Factors. 2001;19(1):1-17. doi: 10.3109/08977190109001072.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When the relative risk of one treatment to the other is not constant over time the question of which therapy has a survival advantage is difficult to determine from the Cox model. An alternative approach to this problem is to plot the difference between the two predicted survival functions with a confidence band that provides information about when these two treatments differ.

METHODS: Twenty-one children with malignant tumors were included in this study. There were 14 males and 7 females aged 3.5-12 years. Underlying disease included high-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL, CR1 in 3 children and CR2 in 5 children), acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML, 9 children), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma stage IV (2 children), and neuroblastoma stage IV (2 children). The peripheral hematopoietic stem cells were collected six to eleven months after complete response, mobilized with high dose chemotherapy alone or combined with GM-CSF or G-CSF. The conditioning regimen consisted of chemotherapy with two to three combinations of the following drugs: cyclophosphamide, arabinosylcytosine, McNU, etopside, and ldarubicin on the basis of TBI (6.0-9.0 Gy). A mean of (1.8 +/- 0.5) x 10(8)/kg autologous mononuclear cells were transplanted. The patients were followed up after transplantation. RESULTS: Severe bone marrow suppression occurred in all patients around day +7. Peripheral white blood cell count decreased to 0 in all patients at day +4.8 +/- 2.9, and platelet count decreased to less than 20 x 10(9)/L at day +9.0 +/- 2.6. Successful engraftment was achieved in 21 patients, but four died of infection at day +17, +20, +31 and +67, respectively. Recovery of white blood cell (WBC) to 10 x 10(9)/L, absolute neutrophil count to 0.5 x 10(9)/L, platelet count to 20 x 10(9)/L occurred on 21 +/- 12, 26 +/- 13, and 27 +/- 10 days, respectively. During the follow up period, three patients relapsed at months, +1.5 years, and +2 years 10 months, respectively. One patient died of intracranial hemorrhage at +8 months. Thirteen patients had event-free survival for 2-12 years, with a mean of 6.7 +/- 3.4 years. CONCLUSION: Our preliminary data suggest that myeloablative therapy with low dose TBI (6.0-9.0 Gy) combined with intensified chemotherapy followed by autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation might be associated with favorable results in children with refractory leukemia or solid tumors.","['Tang, S', 'Huang, D', 'Wang, J', 'Wei, X', 'Ran, C', 'Peng, Y', 'Lu, S', 'Zhang, J']","['Tang S', 'Huang D', 'Wang J', 'Wei X', 'Ran C', 'Peng Y', 'Lu S', 'Zhang J']","['Department of Pediatrics, 301 Hospital, Beijing 100853, China. suoqintang@sina.com']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],China,Chin Med J (Engl),Chinese medical journal,7513795,,IM,"['Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*therapy', '*Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",2001/10/27 10:00,2005/10/22 09:00,['2001/10/27 10:00'],"['2001/10/27 10:00 [pubmed]', '2005/10/22 09:00 [medline]', '2001/10/27 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Chin Med J (Engl). 2001 Oct;114(10):1098-101.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Animal tests using human tumour xenograft models demonstrated that E7070 could cause not only tumour growth suppression, but also tumour regression in three of five colorectal and two of two lung cancers. In the HCT116 xenograft model, E7070 was shown to be superior to 5-FU, MMC and CPT-11 (irinotecan). Furthermore, complete regression of advanced LX-1 tumours was observed in 80% of E7070-treated mice.

We found gene amplification of the p53 gene in one nasal NK cell lymphoma, and point mutations of the p53 gene in one blastic NK cell lymphoma / leukemia and one chronic NK lymphocytosis. In addition, homozygous deletions of p15, p16 and p14 genes in 5 out of 31 samples were detected; 3 were from nasal NK cell lymphoma and 2 from blastic NK cell lymphoma / leukemia. Also hemizygous deletion of the Rb gene in one blastic NK cell lymphoma was detected. Rb proteins were highly expressed in one cell line as well as two myeloid / NK cell precursor acute leukemias. In other cell lines, complete loss and an aberrant migration pattern of Rb protein expression were observed. Comparative genomic hybridization suggested that the homozygous deletions of the p15, p16 and p14 were subtle chromosomal deletions and could not be identified by standard karyotyping in some cases.

However, the transduction efficiency of ALVAC constructs in lymphoid tumors has not yet been characterized.

While ALVAC-B7.1, ALVAC-B7.2, or ALVAC-luciferase vectors effectively expressed recombinant genes in malignancies arising from T- or early B-cell precursors, negative or low expression of ALVAC recombinant genes occurred in tumors arising from mature B-cells. We showed that ALVAC-encoded B7.1 or B7.2 was continuously expressed on the infected, and subsequently irradiated, leukemia cells, and only cells with ALVAC-mediated expression of costimulatory molecules (but not unmodified leukemia cells or those infected with the ALVAC-parental vector) induced significant proliferation and IFN-gamma production by alloreactive T-cells.

This article focuses on new technologies involving: (1) antibody- or growth factor-mediated targeting of antigens or growth factor receptors found on AML blasts and restricted sub-groups of normal cells, (2) pharmacologic targeting of the pathologic t(15;17) translocation of acute promyelocytic leukemia with all-trans retinoic acid, (3) pharmacologic and immunologic targeting of mutant RAS oncogenes and related aberrant signaling in AML blasts, and (4) targeting of pathological signaling of the Bcr-Abl oncoprotein and c-kit tyrosine kinase in myeloid leukemias. These advances herald an exciting new era of AML-specific therapies.","['Perentesis, J P', 'Sievers, E L']","['Perentesis JP', 'Sievers EL']","['Division of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology, and Blood and Marrow Transplantation, University of Minnesota Cancer Center, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA.']",['eng'],"['CA53586/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA99441/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Hematol Oncol Clin North Am,Hematology/oncology clinics of North America,8709473,"['0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Aminoglycosides)', '0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Immunoconjugates)', '0 (Immunotoxins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '93NS566KF7 (Gemtuzumab)']",IM,"['ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Acute Disease', 'Adult', '*Aminoglycosides', 'Animals', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology/therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/drug effects/immunology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Clinical Trials, Phase I as Topic', 'Clinical Trials, Phase II as Topic', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Drug Design', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Forecasting', 'Gemtuzumab', 'Humans', 'Immunoconjugates/therapeutic use', 'Immunotoxins/therapeutic use', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/mortality/radiotherapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasm Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/immunology/metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Risk', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2001/10/26 10:00,2002/04/24 10:01,['2001/10/26 10:00'],"['2001/10/26 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/04/24 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/26 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0889-8588(05)70242-2 [pii]', '10.1016/s0889-8588(05)70242-2 [doi]']",ppublish,"Hematol Oncol Clin North Am. 2001 Aug;15(4):677-701, viii-ix. doi: 10.1016/s0889-8588(05)70242-2.",,146,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) expression was elevated in cisplatin-resistant K562 subclones, and the reduction of GSH levels after treatment with BSO decreased the expression of PCNA.

Chronic graft-versus-host disease persisted, thereafter, in the form of severe diarrhoea, rash and allergic conjunctivitis. Since the patient was then at risk from osteoporosis secondary to calcium malabsorption caused by the diarrhoea, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and ultrasound analysis were used to measure bone mineral density and bone stiffness, respectively. Both measurements were markedly lower than the average values from patients of matched age, gender and physical characteristics. The osteoporosis did not respond to active vitamin D3 0.1 microg/kg once daily, but when this therapy was combined with vitamin K2 15 mg once daily, an increase in bone mineral density and bone stiffness was observed. In conclusion, vitamin D3 and K2 combination therapy merits further evaluation for the treatment of various types of secondary osteoporosis, including steroid-induced osteoporosis.","['Hattori, M', 'Morita, N', 'Tsujino, Y', 'Yamamoto, M', 'Tanizawa, T']","['Hattori M', 'Morita N', 'Tsujino Y', 'Yamamoto M', 'Tanizawa T']","['Department of Pediatrics, Hyogo College of Medicine, Nishinomiya, Japan. hat-ped@hyo-med.ac.jp']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",England,J Int Med Res,The Journal of international medical research,0346411,"['1C6V77QF41 (Cholecalciferol)', '723JX6CXY5 (Vitamin K 3)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Bone Density/drug effects', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Cholecalciferol/*therapeutic use', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*complications', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/therapy', 'Male', 'Osteoporosis/*drug therapy/*etiology', 'Vitamin K 3/*therapeutic use']",2001/10/26 10:00,2002/04/09 10:01,['2001/10/26 10:00'],"['2001/10/26 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/04/09 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/26 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/147323000102900416 [doi]'],ppublish,J Int Med Res. 2001 Jul-Aug;29(4):381-4. doi: 10.1177/147323000102900416.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: An electronic record linkage was conducted between a membership roster of the UFW and the database of the California Cancer Registry, the population-based cancer registry in California for the years 1987-1997. Based upon the results of the linkage, morbidity odds ratios were calculated using the distribution of cancer in the California Hispanic population as the reference to determine if risk of specific cancers was higher or lower in the UFW. Time since first joining the union was evaluated, as was the proportional distribution of histologic subtypes and stage at diagnosis, again comparing the experience of the UFW membership to the California Hispanic population. RESULTS: Several types of cancer were elevated in the UFW membership in comparison to the California Hispanic population. Morbidity odds ratios and 95% confidence limits were elevated for leukemia (O.R. = 1.59: 95% C.I. = 1.07-2.37), stomach cancer (O.R. = 1.69: 95% C.I. = 1.24-2.27), uterine cervix cancer (O.R. = 1.63: 95% C.I. = 1.11-2.44) and uterine corpus cancer (O.R. = 1.68: 95% C.I. = 1.05-2.67). Brain cancer was also elevated although not significantly so (O.R. = 1.57: 95% C.I. = 0.96-2.53). CONCLUSIONS: Risk of leukemia, stomach, cervix and uterine cancers was elevated in California farmworkers. The histologic distribution of leukemia and brain cancers within the UFW membership did not differ from the distribution in the general California population although small numbers of cancers in the UFW hindered interpretation of these results. Members of the UFW experienced later stage of disease at diagnosis in comparison to California Hispanics for most major cancer sites but not for breast cancer.","['Mills, P K', 'Kwong, S']","['Mills PK', 'Kwong S']","['Cancer Registry of Central California, 1320 E.

These differences in risk may be due to developmental factors or differences in pesticide exposure. METHODS: A feasibility study was conducted to determine levels of pesticide metabolites in urine of adults (n = 18) and children (n = 9) in Fresno County, California, an intensely agricultural county in the Central San Joaquin Valley. Spot urine samples were obtained and analyzed for six metabolites of organophosphate (OP) pesticides using gas chromatography with flame photometric detection methods. The metabolites of OP pesticides included DMP, DEP, DMTP, DMDTP, DETP, and DEDTP. RESULTS: Levels were generally low for both adults and children for most metabolites tested. Frequencies of detection ranged from 0 to 37%, with mean levels ranging from non-detectable to 13.22 ppb. However, levels of several metabolites were higher in children than in adults. The most frequently detected metabolite, DMP, was found among 44% of the children and 33% of the adults. DMTP was detected among 33% of the children and 28% of the adults. CONCLUSIONS: These results are difficult to interpret given the sampling variation associated with the small sample size. Nevertheless, because OP pesticides have been associated with increased cancer risk in animal and human studies, these results indicate a need to closely monitor children's exposure to environmental chemicals.","['Mills, P K', 'Zahm, S H']","['Mills PK', 'Zahm SH']","['Cancer Registry of Central California, Fresno, California 93710, USA. paul.mills@ucsfresno.edu']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Am J Ind Med,American journal of industrial medicine,8101110,"['0 (Insecticides)', '0 (Organophosphorus Compounds)', '0 (Pesticide Residues)']",IM,"['Agriculture/*statistics & numerical data', 'California', 'Child', 'Environmental Exposure/*analysis', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Female', 'Hispanic or Latino/statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Insecticides/*urine', 'Male', '*Organophosphorus Compounds', 'Pesticide Residues/*urine']",2001/10/25 10:00,2002/01/10 10:01,['2001/10/25 10:00'],"['2001/10/25 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/10 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/25 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/ajim.10007 [pii]', '10.1002/ajim.10007 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Ind Med. 2001 Nov;40(5):571-7. doi: 10.1002/ajim.10007.,"['Copyright 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There has been a long-lasting debate over whether the traditional threshold for prophylactic platelet transfusion of 20,000/microl is really necessary to prevent hemorrhagic complications. During the last 10 years several studies with more than 1,000 patients together have proven the safety of a platelet transfusion trigger of 10,000/microl or even lower when patients are clinically stable without active bleeding. This experience has been mostly gathered in patients with acute leukemia. But this stringent platelet transfusion policy can be used also after blood stem cell and bone marrow transplantation. In stable patients with aplastic anemia and myelodysplasia, prophylactic transfusions should be replaced in most patients by a therapeutic transfusion strategy. Such restrictive platelet transfusion strategies decrease the risk of infectious disease transmission, immunization, and febrile transfusion reactions. Besides reduced hospital visits and a shorter hospital stay for the patients, the costs for platelet transfusions are lowered by 20%-30% compared with traditional transfusion strategies. The decision to administer platelet transfusions should incorporate individual clinical characteristics of the patients and not simply be a reflexive reaction to the platelet count. Further clinical studies are needed to answer the still open question of whether patients with acute leukemia should also be transfused therapeutically rather than prophylactically when they are in stable condition without signs of active bleeding.","['Wandt, H', 'Ehninger, G', 'Gallmeier, W M']","['Wandt H', 'Ehninger G', 'Gallmeier WM']","['5th Medical Department and Institute of Medical Oncology and Hamatology, Nuremberg, Germany. wandt@klinikum-nuernberg.de']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Oncologist,The oncologist,9607837,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Anemia, Aplastic/*drug therapy/economics', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'Decision Making', 'Fever', 'Health Care Costs/*statistics & numerical data', 'Hospitalization', 'Humans', 'Immunization', 'Infections', 'Length of Stay', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/economics', 'Neural Tube Defects/*drug therapy/economics', 'Patient Care Planning', '*Platelet Transfusion', '*Practice Guidelines as Topic', 'Risk Assessment']",2001/10/25 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/10/25 10:00'],"['2001/10/25 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/25 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1634/theoncologist.6-5-446 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncologist. 2001;6(5):446-50. doi: 10.1634/theoncologist.6-5-446.,,25,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To address these concerns, patients with hairy cell leukemia, a cancer with a very high cure rate, were queried about employment, insurance, finances, and lifestyle during and following their treatment. METHODS: Study participants (n = 31) ranging in age from 24 to 73 years at the time of diagnosis (median, 49 years) were surveyed regarding changes in health and life insurance, employment, out-of-pocket medical costs, exercise, diet, and use of mental and alternative health services that occurred during or following hairy cell leukemia treatment. RESULTS: Following a diagnosis of hairy cell leukemia, 61.3% of the respondents paid for some aspect of medical care in spite of having health insurance coverage at the time of diagnosis. Four respondents (12.9%) could not obtain health insurance following treatment, and the occupational choices of several individuals or their spouses were based in large part on a desire to obtain or maintain comprehensive health insurance. Of the 13 individuals who attempted to purchase life insurance, 10 had difficulty obtaining a policy or were denied coverage. Lifestyle changes were noted by 40% to 60% of respondents, and included reports of more frequent exercise, adoption of a healthier diet, and having a greater appreciation for life, loved ones, and physical health.

This analysis highlights the importance of the differentiation step in APL therapy and justifies ongoing studies aimed at identifying novel RA-differentiation enhancers.","['Cassinat, B', 'Chevret, S', 'Zassadowski, F', 'Balitrand, N', 'Guillemot, I', 'Menot, M L', 'Degos, L', 'Fenaux, P', 'Chomienne, C']","['Cassinat B', 'Chevret S', 'Zassadowski F', 'Balitrand N', 'Guillemot I', 'Menot ML', 'Degos L', 'Fenaux P', 'Chomienne C']","['Laboratoire de Biologie Cellulaire Hematopoietique, Nuclear Medicine Department, Saint-Louis Hospital, Paris, France.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,['5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Bone Marrow Cells/drug effects/pathology', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cohort Studies', 'Drug Resistance', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy/*mortality/*pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Myeloid Cells/drug effects/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology']",2001/10/25 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/10/25 10:00'],"['2001/10/25 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/25 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood.v98.9.2862 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)56902-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2001 Nov 1;98(9):2862-4. doi: 10.1182/blood.v98.9.2862.,,,,,,,,,,['European APL Group'],,,,,,,,,,

Heterozygous mutations affecting the hematopoietic transcription factor CBFA2 (also AML1/RUNX1) were recently reported to be associated with familial platelet disorder with predisposition to acute myeloid leukemia (FPD/AML, MIM 601399). A new 3-generation family with FPD/AML with a novel CBFA2 mutation is described. In this family, AML was diagnosed in a second-generation male. After allogeneic stem cell transplantation from his human leukocyte antigen-identical sister, a donor-derived, genetically identical leukemia developed in the recipient and the donor. Sequencing analysis identified a G-to-T transition within the CBFA2 gene, which involves codon 198, encoding a conserved aspartic acid within the DNA- binding Runt domain. Three of 5 siblings affected with the FPD/AML trait harbored the mutation in a heterozygous form. This experience underscores the necessity of performing mutation analysis of the CBFA2 gene before sibling allogeneic transplantation in families with FPD/AML.","['Buijs, A', 'Poddighe, P', 'van Wijk, R', 'van Solinge, W', 'Borst, E', 'Verdonck, L', 'Hagenbeek, A', 'Pearson, P', 'Lokhorst, H']","['Buijs A', 'Poddighe P', 'van Wijk R', 'van Solinge W', 'Borst E', 'Verdonck L', 'Hagenbeek A', 'Pearson P', 'Lokhorst H']","['Division of Medical Genetics and the Departments of Hematology, Immunology, and Clinical Chemistry, University Medical Center Utrecht, The Netherlands. a.buijs@dmg.azu.nl']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Blood Platelet Disorders/complications/*genetics', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Family Health', 'Female', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/blood/etiology/*genetics', 'Male', 'Mutation, Missense', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics', 'Pedigree', '*Point Mutation', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics']",2001/10/25 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/10/25 10:00'],"['2001/10/25 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/25 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood.v98.9.2856 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)56900-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2001 Nov 1;98(9):2856-8. doi: 10.1182/blood.v98.9.2856.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study identified t(6;14)(p21.1;q32.3) in 3 cases of transformed extranodal marginal zone B-NHL, in 1 case of SLVL, and in 1 case of a low-grade B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder. In a sixth case, a CD5(+) DLBCL, the translocation was identified by molecular cloning in the absence of cytogenetically detectable change. Two chromosomal translocation breakpoints were cloned by using long-distance inverse polymerase chain reaction methods. Comparison with the genomic sequence for chromosome 6p21.1 showed breakpoints approximately 59 and 73.5 kilobases 5' of the cyclin D3 (CCND3) gene with no other identifiable transcribed sequences in the intervening region. Although Southern blotting with derived genomic 6p21.1 probes failed to detect other rearrangements, fluorescent in situ hybridization assays, using BAC (bacterial artificial chromosome) clones spanning and flanking the CCND3 locus, along with probes for IGH confirmed localization of 6p21.1 breakpoints within the same region, as well as fusion of the CCND3 and IGH loci. Furthermore, in all cases, high-level expression of CCND3 was demonstrated at RNA and/or protein levels by Northern and Western blotting and by immunohistochemistry. These data implicate CCND3 as a dominant oncogene in the pathogenesis and transformation in several histologic subtypes of mature B-cell malignancies with t(6;14)(p21.1;q32.3) and suggest that CCND3 overexpression seen in about 10% of DLBCL cases may have a genetic basis.","['Sonoki, T', 'Harder, L', 'Horsman, D E', 'Karran, L', 'Taniguchi, I', 'Willis, T G', 'Gesk, S', 'Steinemann, D', 'Zucca, E', 'Schlegelberger, B', 'Sole, F', 'Mungall, A J', 'Gascoyne, R D', 'Siebert, R', 'Dyer, M J']","['Sonoki T', 'Harder L', 'Horsman DE', 'Karran L', 'Taniguchi I', 'Willis TG', 'Gesk S', 'Steinemann D', 'Zucca E', 'Schlegelberger B', 'Sole F', 'Mungall AJ', 'Gascoyne RD', 'Siebert R', 'Dyer MJ']","['Academic Department of Haematology and Cytogenetics, Institute of Cancer Research, Sutton, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],['5 U01 CA84967-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (CCND3 protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin D3)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'B-Lymphocytes/chemistry/pathology/ultrastructure', 'Base Sequence', 'Chromosome Breakage/genetics', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 6', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Cyclin D3', 'Cyclins/*genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/chemistry/*genetics/pathology', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Translocation, Genetic/*genetics']",2001/10/25 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/10/25 10:00'],"['2001/10/25 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/25 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood.v98.9.2837 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)56897-3 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2001 Nov 1;98(9):2837-44. doi: 10.1182/blood.v98.9.2837.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here it is reported that S-1P prevents apoptosis and executioner caspase-3 activation by inhibiting the translocation of cytochrome c and Smac/DIABLO from mitochondria to the cytosol induced by anti-Fas, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), serum deprivation, and cell-permeable ceramides in the human acute leukemia Jurkat, U937, and HL-60 cell lines. Furthermore, the tumor promoter 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate, which stimulates sphingosine kinase, the enzyme responsible for S-1P production, also inhibits cytochrome c and Smac/DIABLO release. In contrast, dimethylsphingosine (DMS), a specific inhibitor of sphingosine kinase, sensitizes cells to cytochrome c and Smac/DIABLO release triggered by anti-Fas, TNF-alpha, serum deprivation, or ceramide. DMS-induced mitochondrial apoptogenic factor leakage can likewise be overcome by S-1P cotreatment. Hence, S-1P, likely generated through a protein kinase C- mediated activation of sphingosine kinase, inhibits the apoptotic cascade upstream of the release of the mitochondrial apoptogenic factors, cytochrome c, and Smac/DIABLO in human acute leukemia cells.","['Cuvillier, O', 'Levade, T']","['Cuvillier O', 'Levade T']","['Inserm U466, Toulouse, France. olivier.cuvillier@rangueil.inserm.fr']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Ceramides)', '0 (Culture Media, Serum-Free)', '0 (Cytochrome c Group)', '0 (DIABLO protein, human)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Lysophospholipids)', '0 (Mitochondrial Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '26993-30-6 (sphingosine 1-phosphate)', 'L9QRA71834 (N,N-dimethylsphingosine)', 'NGZ37HRE42 (Sphingosine)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'Carrier Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/drug effects/metabolism', 'Ceramides/pharmacology', 'Culture Media, Serum-Free/pharmacology', 'Cytochrome c Group/*antagonists & inhibitors/drug effects/metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia/*pathology', '*Lysophospholipids', 'Mitochondria/*metabolism', 'Mitochondrial Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/drug effects/metabolism', 'Protein Transport/drug effects', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/physiology', 'Sphingosine/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'U937 Cells']",2001/10/25 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/10/25 10:00'],"['2001/10/25 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/25 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood.v98.9.2828 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)56896-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2001 Nov 1;98(9):2828-36. doi: 10.1182/blood.v98.9.2828.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this report, mice reconstituted with P210(BCR/ABL)-transduced bone marrow cells received posttransplantation therapy with either the tyrosine kinase inhibitor STI571 or placebo. Compared with the rapidly fatal leukemia of placebo-treated animals, 80% of the STI571-treated mice were alive on day 74, with marked improvement in peripheral white blood counts and splenomegaly. There was decreased tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5, Shc, and Crk-L in leukemic cells from STI571-treated animals, consistent with STI571-mediated inhibition of the Bcr/Abl tyrosine kinase in vivo. In some STI571-treated animals Bcr/Abl messenger RNA and protein expression were markedly increased. In contrast to the polyclonal leukemia of placebo-treated mice, STI571-treated murine CML was generally oligoclonal, suggesting that STI571 eliminated or severely suppressed certain leukemic clones. None of the STI571-treated mice were cured of the CML-like myeloproliferative disorder, however, and STI571-treated murine CML was transplanted to secondary recipients with high efficiency. These results demonstrate the utility of this murine model of CML in the evaluation of novel therapeutic agents against Bcr/Abl-induced leukemias. This improved murine chronic-phase CML model may be a useful tool for the study of STI571 resistance, CML progression, and the anti-CML immune response.","['Wolff, N C', 'Ilaria, R L Jr']","['Wolff NC', 'Ilaria RL Jr']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, Simmons Cancer Center, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX 75390-8593, USA.']",['eng'],['R01 CA61764/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Immediate-Early Proteins)', '0 (Milk Proteins)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (cytokine inducible SH2-containing protein)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/drug effects/metabolism', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/metabolism', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Immediate-Early Proteins/genetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/drug therapy/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', '*Milk Proteins', 'Piperazines/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor', 'Spleen/metabolism/pathology', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins', 'Survival Rate', 'Trans-Activators/drug effects/metabolism', 'Transduction, Genetic']",2001/10/25 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/10/25 10:00'],"['2001/10/25 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/25 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood.v98.9.2808 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)56894-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2001 Nov 1;98(9):2808-16. doi: 10.1182/blood.v98.9.2808.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In some leukemia cell lines, cytotoxic drugs induce expression of Fas-L, which may contribute to cell killing through the ligation of Fas. The involvement of Fas, Fas-L, and caspase 8 was studied in the killing of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) cells by chlorambucil, fludarabine, or gamma radiation. Spontaneous apoptosis was observed at 24-hour incubation, with additional apoptosis induced by each of the cytotoxic treatments. Although Fas mRNA expression was elevated after exposure to chlorambucil, fludarabine, or gamma radiation, Fas protein levels only increased after irradiation. Therefore, Fas expression may be regulated by multiple mechanisms that allow the translation of Fas mRNA only in response to restricted cytotoxic stimuli. None of the cytotoxic stimuli studied here induced Fas-L expression. An agonistic anti-Fas monoclonal antibody (CH-11) did not significantly augment apoptosis induction by any of the death stimuli. A Fas-blocking antibody (ZB4) did not inhibit spontaneous, chlorambucil-, fludarabine-, or radiation-induced apoptosis. However, procaspase 8 processing was induced by all cytotoxic stimuli. These data suggest that the Fas/Fas-L signaling system does not play a major role in the induction of apoptosis in B-CLL cells treated with cytotoxic drugs or radiation. However, Fas-independent activation of caspase 8 may play a crucial role in the regulation of apoptosis in these cells.","['Jones, D T', 'Ganeshaguru, K', 'Virchis, A E', 'Folarin, N I', 'Lowdell, M W', 'Mehta, A B', 'Prentice, H G', 'Hoffbrand, A V', 'Wickremasinghe, R G']","['Jones DT', 'Ganeshaguru K', 'Virchis AE', 'Folarin NI', 'Lowdell MW', 'Mehta AB', 'Prentice HG', 'Hoffbrand AV', 'Wickremasinghe RG']","['Department of Hematology, Royal Free and University College Medical School, Royal Free Campus, London, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (FASLG protein, human)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (fas Receptor)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP8 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/physiology', 'B-Lymphocytes/drug effects/pathology/radiation effects', 'Caspase 8', 'Caspase 9', 'Caspases/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Drug Interactions', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Fas Ligand Protein', 'Female', 'Gamma Rays', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/*pathology/radiotherapy', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/analysis', '*Signal Transduction', 'fas Receptor/analysis/immunology/*pharmacology']",2001/10/25 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/10/25 10:00'],"['2001/10/25 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/25 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood.v98.9.2800 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)56893-6 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2001 Nov 1;98(9):2800-7. doi: 10.1182/blood.v98.9.2800.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

No cytotoxic effect was observed when cells were incubated with rituximab alone, but in the presence of human AB serum rituximab induced complement-dependent cell death (R-CDC). A cytotoxic effect was observed in cells from 9 of 33 patients with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia, 16 of 16 patients with mantle-cell lymphoma, 4 of 4 patients with follicular lymphoma, and 2 of 2 patients with hairy-cell leukemia. R-CDC was observed in cells from patients expressing more than 50 x 10(3) CD20 molecules per cell, and directly correlated with the number of CD20 molecules per cell. Preincubation with anti-CD59 increased the cytotoxic effect of rituximab and sensitized cells from nonsensitive cases. Neither cleavage of poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) nor activation of caspase-3 was observed in R-CDC. In addition, no cells with a hypodiploid DNA content were detected and R-CDC was not prevented by a broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor, suggesting a caspase-independent mechanism. Incubation with rituximab in the presence of AB serum induced a rapid and intense production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). R-CDC was blocked by the incubation of cells with N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) or Tiron, 2 ROS scavengers, indicating that the cytotoxic effect was due to the generation of superoxide (O) radicals. In conclusion, the results of the present study suggest that CD20, CD59, and complement have a role in the in vitro cytotoxic effect of rituximab, which is mediated by a caspase-independent process that involves ROS generation.","['Bellosillo, B', 'Villamor, N', 'Lopez-Guillermo, A', 'Marce, S', 'Esteve, J', 'Campo, E', 'Colomer, D', 'Montserrat, E']","['Bellosillo B', 'Villamor N', 'Lopez-Guillermo A', 'Marce S', 'Esteve J', 'Campo E', 'Colomer D', 'Montserrat E']","['Hematopathology Unit, Department of Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Oncology, Postgraduate School of Hematology Farreras-Valenti, Barcelona, Spain.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Antigens, CD20)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CD55 Antigens)', '0 (CD59 Antigens)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', '9007-36-7 (Complement System Proteins)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*pharmacology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived', 'Antigens, CD20/analysis', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'B-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/enzymology/metabolism/pathology', 'CD55 Antigens/pharmacology', 'CD59 Antigens/pharmacology', 'Caspases/*pharmacology', 'Cell Death/*drug effects', 'Complement System Proteins/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/*blood/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'Rituximab']",2001/10/25 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/10/25 10:00'],"['2001/10/25 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/25 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood.v98.9.2771 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)56889-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2001 Nov 1;98(9):2771-7. doi: 10.1182/blood.v98.9.2771.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In most cells, transferrin receptor-mediated endocytosis is a major pathway for cellular iron uptake. Recently, transferrin receptor 2 (TfR2), another receptor for transferrin, was cloned. High levels of expression of TfR2 messenger RNA (mRNA) occur in the liver, as well as in HepG2 (a hepatoma cell line) and K562 (an erythroid leukemia cell line). In this study, TfR2 mRNA expression was analyzed in hematological cell lines, normal erythroid cells at various stages of differentiation, and leukemia and preleukemia cells. High levels of TfR2 expression occurred in all of the erythroid cell lines that were examined. Erythroid-specific expression of TfR2 protein in bone marrow cells was confirmed by immunohistochemical staining. Expression of TfR2 mRNA was high in normal CD34(+) erythroid precursor cells, and levels decreased during erythroid differentiation in vitro. Levels of expression of TfR2-alpha mRNA were significantly higher in erythroleukemia (M6) marrow samples than in nonmalignant control marrow samples. In addition, relatively higher levels of TfR2-alpha mRNA expression occurred in some samples of myelodysplastic syndrome that had erythroid hyperplasia in bone marrow, acute myelogenous leukemia M1, M2, and chronic myelogenous leukemia. Expression profiles of normal members of the erythroid lineage suggest that TfR2-alpha may be a useful marker of early erythroid precursor cells. The clinical significance of TfR2-alpha expression in leukemia cells remains to be determined.","['Kawabata, H', 'Nakamaki, T', 'Ikonomi, P', 'Smith, R D', 'Germain, R S', 'Koeffler, H P']","['Kawabata H', 'Nakamaki T', 'Ikonomi P', 'Smith RD', 'Germain RS', 'Koeffler HP']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Burns and Allen Research Institute, University of California, Los Angeles, School of Medicine, 90048, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)', '0 (TFR2 protein, human)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/chemistry', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*chemistry', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia/classification/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/metabolism/pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*chemistry', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Receptors, Transferrin/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/10/25 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/10/25 10:00'],"['2001/10/25 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/25 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood.v98.9.2714 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)56881-X [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2001 Nov 1;98(9):2714-9. doi: 10.1182/blood.v98.9.2714.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Breakpoints within intron 3 of PML produce a short PML/RAR-alpha isoform, whereas breakpoints within intron 6 result in a longer form. Using RT-PCR, serial evaluations were performed on the bone marrow of 82 patients with APL (median follow-up, > 63 months) who received retinoic acid (RA) induction followed by postremission treatment with chemotherapy, RA, and biologic agents. Sixty-four patients attained a clinical complete remission and had at least 2 RT-PCR assays performed after completing therapy. Forty of 47 patients (85%) with newly diagnosed APL who were induced using RA had residual disease detectable by RT-PCR before additional therapy. After 3 cycles of consolidation therapy, residual disease was found in only 4 of 40 evaluable patients (10%). Among newly diagnosed patients who had 2 or more negative RT-PCR assays, only 3 of 41 (7%) had a relapse, whereas all 4 patients (100%) who had 2 or more positive results had a relapse. Among 63 newly diagnosed patients, those who expressed the short isoform appeared to have shorter disease-free and overall survival durations than patients who expressed the long isoform. These data indicate that 2 or more negative RT-PCR assays on bone marrow, performed at least 1 month apart after completing therapy, are strongly associated with long-term remissions. Conversely, a confirmed positive test is highly predictive of relapse.","['Jurcic, J G', 'Nimer, S D', 'Scheinberg, D A', 'DeBlasio, T', 'Warrell, R P Jr', 'Miller, W H Jr']","['Jurcic JG', 'Nimer SD', 'Scheinberg DA', 'DeBlasio T', 'Warrell RP Jr', 'Miller WH Jr']","['Leukemia, Hematology, and Developmental Chemotherapy Services, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10021, USA. jurcicj@mskcc.org']",['eng'],"['CA 05826/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 33049/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism', 'Child', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*diagnosis/genetics/therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Neoplasm, Residual/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protein Isoforms/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Survival Analysis']",2001/10/25 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/10/25 10:00'],"['2001/10/25 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/25 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood.v98.9.2651 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)56873-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2001 Nov 1;98(9):2651-6. doi: 10.1182/blood.v98.9.2651.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

No statistical differences were observed between the 2 treatment arms with respect to hematologic toxicity or infections. Mucositis and alopecia occurred significantly more often in patients treated with CAP. Partial responses were obtained in 14 patients (30%) treated with fludarabine and 5 patients (11%) treated with CAP (P =.019). Responses were more durable in patients treated with fludarabine (19 months versus 3 months), and the event-free survival rate was significantly higher in this group (P <.01). Forty-four patients died, 22 in the fludarabine group and 22 in the CAP group. There was no statistical difference in the median overall survival time in the 2 study arms. Fludarabine was thus more active than CAP in salvage therapy of WM and should be tested as first-line therapy in a randomized comparison with alkylating agents.","['Leblond, V', 'Levy, V', 'Maloisel, F', 'Cazin, B', 'Fermand, J P', 'Harousseau, J L', 'Remenieras, L', 'Porcher, R', 'Gardembas, M', 'Marit, G', 'Deconinck, E', 'Desablens, B', 'Guilhot, F', 'Philippe, G', 'Stamatoullas, A', 'Guibon, O']","['Leblond V', 'Levy V', 'Maloisel F', 'Cazin B', 'Fermand JP', 'Harousseau JL', 'Remenieras L', 'Porcher R', 'Gardembas M', 'Marit G', 'Deconinck E', 'Desablens B', 'Guilhot F', 'Philippe G', 'Stamatoullas A', 'Guibon O']","[""Departement d'hematologie, Hopital Pitie-Salpetriere, AP-HP, Paris, France. veronique.leblond@psl.ap-hop-paris.fr""]",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Alopecia/chemically induced', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/*administration & dosage/toxicity', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage/toxicity', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Drug Resistance', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mouth Mucosa', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage', 'Recurrence', 'Salvage Therapy', 'Stomatitis/chemically induced', 'Survival Analysis', 'Therapeutic Equivalency', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vidarabine/*administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/toxicity', 'Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia/complications/*drug therapy/mortality']",2001/10/25 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/10/25 10:00'],"['2001/10/25 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/25 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood.v98.9.2640 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)56871-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2001 Nov 1;98(9):2640-4. doi: 10.1182/blood.v98.9.2640.,,,,,,,,,,['French Cooperative Group on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia and Macroglobulinemia'],,,,,,,,,,

This study analyzed CD38 expression by flow cytometry and soluble APO1/Fas (sAPO1/Fas), Bcl-2 (sBcl-2), and CD23 (sCD23) proteins by immunoenzymatic methods to evaluate their effect on the clinical course of 168 unselected B-CLL patients. Intermediate/high risk modified Rai stages were characterized by a higher CD38(+) B-cell number (P =.0002) and higher sCD23 levels (P <.0001). Moreover, CD38(+) B-cell percentages were significantly and directly associated both with beta(2)-microglobulin and sCD23 concentrations (P <.0001 and P =.002, respectively). Both a higher tumor burden (lymphadenopathy/splenomegaly) and a lymphocyte doubling time less than 12 months were significantly associated with higher CD38(+) percentages (P <.0001 and P =.0001, respectively). With regard to clinical outcome, progression-free survival was significantly longer (75% versus 37% at 5 years; P =.00006) in patients with lower CD38(+) B-cell percentages. Furthermore, the risk of partial or no response to fludarabine increased with increasing CD38 expression (P =.003), and a shorter overall survival (50% versus 92% at 8 years; P <.00001) characterized patients with more than 30% CD38(+) B-cell number. The predictive value of CD38 expression was maintained among the patients within the Rai intermediate risk group and was confirmed in multivariate analysis. Thus, the percentage of CD38(+) B cells appears to be an accurate predictor of clinical outcome and therefore could be used to indicate when more novel chemotherapeutic approaches are needed.","['Del Poeta, G', 'Maurillo, L', 'Venditti, A', 'Buccisano, F', 'Epiceno, A M', 'Capelli, G', 'Tamburini, A', 'Suppo, G', 'Battaglia, A', 'Del Principe, M I', 'Del Moro, B', 'Masi, M', 'Amadori, S']","['Del Poeta G', 'Maurillo L', 'Venditti A', 'Buccisano F', 'Epiceno AM', 'Capelli G', 'Tamburini A', 'Suppo G', 'Battaglia A', 'Del Principe MI', 'Del Moro B', 'Masi M', 'Amadori S']","['Cattedra e Divisione di Ematologia, Universita Tor Vergata, Ospedale S.Eugenio, Roma, Italy. g.delpoeta@tin.it']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (CD38 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (NAD+ Nucleosidase)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase', 'ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Antigens, CD', 'Antigens, Differentiation/*metabolism', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology/metabolism', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*metabolism', 'Cohort Studies', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Middle Aged', 'NAD+ Nucleosidase/*metabolism', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Survival Analysis']",2001/10/25 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/10/25 10:00'],"['2001/10/25 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/25 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood.v98.9.2633 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)56870-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2001 Nov 1;98(9):2633-9. doi: 10.1182/blood.v98.9.2633.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To investigate the influence of ETV6/CBFA2 on cellular transformation, the fusion gene was cloned into a murine ecotropic retroviral vector and transduced into IL-3-dependent Ba/F3 and 32Dcl.3 and IL-7-dependent IxN/2b murine hematopoietic cell lines. Different variants of ETV6/CBFA2, corresponding to CBFA2 alternatively spliced variants, and the reciprocal product CBFA2/ETV6, were stably expressed in each of these cell lines. However, although Western blot analysis demonstrated expression of each variant, none of the stable cell lines expressing CBFA2/ETV6 or the variants conferred factor-independent growth. We further investigated the effect of ETV6/CBFA2 expression in vivo by generating transgenic mice in which expression of the fusion was directed to lymphoid cells using the immunoglobulin heavy chain enhancer/promoter. Four founder mice were identified showing transmission and expression of the chimeric product. The mice were bred for five generations and followed for more than 24 months. The mice did not develop a malignant hematologic disorder, nor did they display histopathologic, morphologic, or immunophenotypic abnormalities, although ETV6/CBFA2 expression was confirmed in each line.

Our results suggest that information about molecular response to treatment can be used to predict long-term outcome in relapsed childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia.","['Eckert, C', 'Biondi, A', 'Seeger, K', 'Cazzaniga, G', 'Hartmann, R', 'Beyermann, B', 'Pogodda, M', 'Proba, J', 'Henze, G']","['Eckert C', 'Biondi A', 'Seeger K', 'Cazzaniga G', 'Hartmann R', 'Beyermann B', 'Pogodda M', 'Proba J', 'Henze G']",,['eng'],,"['Letter', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Lancet,"Lancet (London, England)",2985213R,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/genetics/therapy', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies']",2001/10/25 10:00,2001/11/03 10:01,['2001/10/25 10:00'],"['2001/10/25 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/11/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/25 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0140-6736(01)06355-3 [pii]', '10.1016/S0140-6736(01)06355-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Lancet. 2001 Oct 13;358(9289):1239-41. doi: 10.1016/S0140-6736(01)06355-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several oncogene products, most notably bcl-2, c-raf-1, protein kinase C-alpha, and H-ras, have been evaluated as targets for therapeutic downregulation, and oligodeoxynucleotides designed to inhibit the expression of these products specifically have been studied extensively in phase I and II trials in cancer patients. Inhibition of target expression in tumor (non-Hodgkin lymphoma) and surrogate tissues has been demonstrated in several of these trials. Continuous infusion over 2 to 3 weeks appears preferable to weekly administration for toxicity and downregulation of target mRNA. The efficacy data available suggest that antisense therapy alone appears capable of limiting disease progression in some patients, but major tumor responses are uncommon. The specificity and tolerability of these oligodeoxynucleotides support the investigation of combinations of antisense oligodeoxynucleotides with cytotoxic chemotherapy, and early combination studies have yielded results of interest.

Although these agents were developed to prevent a processing step necessary for membrane attachment and maturation of Ras proteins, recent studies suggest that farnesyltransferase inhibitors block the farnesylation of additional cellular polypeptides, thereby exerting antitumor effects independent of the presence of activating ras gene mutations. Clinical trials of two farnesyltransferase inhibitors--the tricyclic SCH66336 and the methylquinolone R115777--as single agents have demonstrated disease stabilization or objective responses in 10 to 15% of patients with refractory malignancies. Combinations of farnesyltransferase inhibitors with cytotoxic chemotherapies are yielding complete and partial responses in patients with advanced solid tumors. A phase I trial of R115777 in refractory and relapsed acute leukemias induced responses in 8 (32%) of 25 patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (including two complete remissions) and in two of three with chronic myelogenous leukemia in blast crisis. In patients with solid tumors, accessible normal tissues such as peripheral blood lymphocytes or, perhaps more germane to epithelial malignancies, buccal mucosa have provided surrogate tissues that allow confirmation that farnesyltransferase is inhibited in vivo at clinically achievable drug doses. In conjunction with the R115777 acute leukemia trial, serial measurements provided evidence of farnesyltransferase enzyme inhibition, interference with farnesyltransferase function ( ie, protein processing), and blockade of signal transduction pathways in leukemic bone marrow cells. Preclinical studies of farnesyltransferase inhibitor resistance and clinical trials of farnesyltransferase inhibitors in combination with other agents currently are in progress.","['Karp, J E', 'Kaufmann, S H', 'Adjei, A A', 'Lancet, J E', 'Wright, J J', 'End, D W']","['Karp JE', 'Kaufmann SH', 'Adjei AA', 'Lancet JE', 'Wright JJ', 'End DW']","['University of Maryland Greenebaum Cancer Center, Baltimore, Maryland 21201, USA. jkarp@umm.edu']",['eng'],['U01 CA669854/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Curr Opin Oncol,Current opinion in oncology,9007265,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (Quinolones)', 'EC 2.5.- (Alkyl and Aryl Transferases)', 'EC 2.5.1.29 (Farnesyltranstransferase)', 'IOW153004F (lonafarnib)', 'MAT637500A (tipifarnib)']",IM,"['Alkyl and Aryl Transferases/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Farnesyltranstransferase', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/physiopathology', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Piperidines/*pharmacology', 'Pyridines/*pharmacology', 'Quinolones/*pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction']",2001/10/24 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/10/24 10:00'],"['2001/10/24 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/24 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00001622-200111000-00009 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Oncol. 2001 Nov;13(6):470-6. doi: 10.1097/00001622-200111000-00009.,,53,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several compounds were manufactured for this purpose, and phase III trials of PSC833, one of the most potent P-glycoprotein inhibitors, are completed.

We describe a novel, HPLC-based method for discrimination among polyclonal, oligoclonal, and/or clonal T-cell receptor gamma (TCR-gamma) rearrangements in samples from children with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia. METHODS: TCR rearrangements were PCR amplified from initial leukemic samples and, after heteroduplex-induction, the clonality status of each product was evaluated. To attain this, we used DHPLC on a high-resolution micropellicular matrix. Running conditions were established by melting-curve analysis of known clonal and polyclonal products and melting-point prediction software. Elution profiles were studied at 50 degrees C (native) and, to achieve optimal separation, at different column temperatures between 56 and 64 degrees C. RESULTS: For VgammaI-Jgamma1.3/2.3 rearrangements, an analysis temperature of 60 degrees C with a linear triethylammoniumacetate-acetonitrile gradient separated clonal bands from the polyclonal background amplification. Less than 15% clonal PCR product was detectable in mixtures of initial leukemic cell DNA and polyclonal DNA. Biallelic rearrangements produced two sharp peaks. Clonality of PCR products from 100 initial leukemic samples was completely identified in all investigated cases. CONCLUSIONS: Heteroduplex analysis with standardized DHPLC conditions simplifies the detection of unknown clonal or polyclonal TCR rearrangements in newly diagnosed leukemias. Clonal targets for detection of minimal residual disease are available after a short, automated analysis of PCR amplified rearrangements.","['zur Stadt, U', 'Rischewski, J', 'Schneppenheim, R', 'Kabisch, H']","['zur Stadt U', 'Rischewski J', 'Schneppenheim R', 'Kabisch H']","[""Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Children's Hospital, Martinistrasse 52, D-20246 Hamburg, Germany. zurstadt@uke.uni-hamburge.de""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Clin Chem,Clinical chemistry,9421549,"['0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid/methods', 'Heteroduplex Analysis', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta/*genetics']",2001/10/24 10:00,2001/11/03 10:01,['2001/10/24 10:00'],"['2001/10/24 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/11/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/24 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Chem. 2001 Nov;47(11):2003-11.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our results showed that LB cells had a pseudo-diploid karyotype with 40 acrocentric chromosomes in which trisomy of chromosome 14 was the most relevant alteration. The sensitive cell line showed this alteration in all metaphases studied; no changes in karyotypes were observed in either subline, despite their dissimilar morphology and growth patterns. In contrast, both resistant lines displayed a more heterogeneous karyotype with no common markers, except for the finding that chromosome 5 was involved in a trisomy in LBR-V160 and in a translocation with chromosome 12 in LBR-D160.

However, successful cytogenetics by standard techniques has been hindered by the low in vitro mitotic activity of the malignant B-cell population. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) has become a useful tool, but it does not provide an overall view of the aberrations. To overcome this hurdle, two DNA-based techniques have been tested in the present study: comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) and amplotyping by arbitrarily primed PCR (AP-PCR). Comparative genomic hybridization resolution depends upon the 400-bands of the human standard karyotype. AP-PCR allows detection of allelic losses and gains in tumor cells by PCR fingerprinting, thus its resolution is at the molecular level. Both techniques were performed in 23 patients with stage A B-CLL at diagnosis. The results were compared with FISH. The sensitivity of AP-PCR was greater than CGH (62% vs. 43%). The use of CGH combined with AP-PCR allowed to detect genetic abnormalities in 79% (15/19) of patients in whom G-banding was not informative, providing a global view of the aberrations in a sole experiment.

To unravel the role of these prothrombotic risk factors and different treatment modalities, the present comparative study was performed in childhood leukemia patients of the same living population. Four hundred and twenty consecutively recruited leukemic children (BFM n=300; COALL n=120) were enrolled in this study with respect to the presence of prothrombotic risk factors and the occurrence of symptomatic venous thrombosis. No significant difference was found in the prevalence rates of thrombotic risk factors in the Caucasian populations studied. Symptomatic venous thromboembolism occurred in 11.6% of BFM patients compared with 2.5% in the COALL treatment group [odds ratio (OR)/95% confidence intervals (CI): 7.7/1.8-32.6; P=.005]. Including age, prothrombotic risk factors, central venous lines, treatment protocols, and anti-leukemic drugs in a logistic regression model, only the concomitant Escherichia coli asparaginase/prednisone administration in leukemic children suffering from a prothrombotic risk factor was found to increase the rate of thrombotic manifestations during leukemia treatment in patients of the same Caucasian origin (OR/95% CI: 34.5/4.39-271.42; P=.0008). Based on the data presented here, we suggest the use of prednisone and E. coli asparaginase concomitantly administered in a leukemic patient suffering from a prothrombotic risk factor to be responsible for the onset of venous thrombosis in the majority of cases.","['Nowak-Gottl, U', 'Heinecke, A', 'von Kries, R', 'Nurnberger, W', 'Munchow, N', 'Junker, R']","['Nowak-Gottl U', 'Heinecke A', 'von Kries R', 'Nurnberger W', 'Munchow N', 'Junker R']","[""Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, University of Munster Children's Hospital, Albert Schweitzerstrasse 33, Munster D-48149, Germany. leagottl@uni-muenster.de""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Thromb Res,Thrombosis research,0326377,"['EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Asparaginase/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Data Collection', 'Escherichia coli/enzymology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/*complications/drug therapy', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Prevalence', 'Risk Factors', 'Thrombophilia/blood/complications/diagnosis', 'Thrombosis/blood/chemically induced/*etiology', 'Venous Thrombosis']",2001/10/24 10:00,2002/03/19 10:01,['2001/10/24 10:00'],"['2001/10/24 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/19 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/24 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0049-3848(01)00286-9 [pii]', '10.1016/s0049-3848(01)00286-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Thromb Res. 2001 Aug 1;103(3):165-72. doi: 10.1016/s0049-3848(01)00286-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DC can be generated in vitro from blood-isolated CD14(+) monocytes or CD34(+) hematopoietic progenitor cells in the presence of various cytokines. In this study, we investigated whether monocytes obtained from placental cord blood are capable of differentiation into dendritic cells when cultured with a combination of cytokines - granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interleukin-4 (IL-4), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). We then examined HIV infection, HIV receptor (CD4, CCR5) expression, and beta-chemokine [macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha and -1beta (MIP-1alpha, MIP-1beta)] production by placental cord monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MDDC) as compared to that of autologous cord monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM). Monocytes isolated from placental cord blood differentiate into DC after 7 days in culture with the mixture of cytokines, as demonstrated by development of characteristic DC morphology, loss of CD14 expression, and gain of CD83, a marker for mature DC. Mature cord MDDC had significantly lower susceptibility to M-tropic ADA (CCR5-dependent) envelope-pseudotyped HIV infection in comparison to autologous placental cord MDM, whereas there was no significant difference in virus replication in cord MDDC and MDM infected with murine leukemia virus envelope-pseudotyped HIV (HIV receptor-independent). This limited susceptibility of cord MDDC to M-tropic HIV infection may be due to lower expression of CD4 and CCR5 on the cell membrane and higher production of MIP-1alpha and MIP-1beta. These data provide important information toward our understanding of the biological properties of cord MDDC in relation to HIV infection.","['Folcik, R M', 'Merrill, J D', 'Li, Y', 'Guo, C J', 'Douglas, S D', 'Starr, S E', 'Ho, W Z']","['Folcik RM', 'Merrill JD', 'Li Y', 'Guo CJ', 'Douglas SD', 'Starr SE', 'Ho WZ']","[""Division of Immunologic and Infectious Diseases, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.""]",['eng'],"['P30 AI45008/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 AI 32921/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 MH 49981/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', 'DA 12815/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 AI045008/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DA012815/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 MH049981/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 AI032921/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Hematother Stem Cell Res,Journal of hematotherapy & stem cell research,100892915,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (CD4 Antigens)', '0 (CD83 antigen)', '0 (Immunoglobulins)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharide Receptors)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, CCR5)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD', 'Antigens, CD34/immunology', 'CD4 Antigens/genetics', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dendritic Cells/drug effects/metabolism/*virology', 'Female', 'Fetal Blood/*cytology/drug effects/immunology', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'HIV Infections/metabolism/*virology', 'HIV-1/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulins/immunology', 'Interleukin-4/pharmacology', 'Lipopolysaccharide Receptors/immunology', 'Luciferases/genetics/metabolism', 'Macrophages/drug effects/immunology/metabolism', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/immunology', 'Monocytes/*cytology/drug effects/immunology', 'Placenta', 'Pregnancy', 'RNA, Messenger/drug effects/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, CCR5/genetics', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology']",2001/10/24 10:00,2002/01/12 10:01,['2001/10/24 10:00'],"['2001/10/24 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/12 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/24 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/152581601753193823 [doi]'],ppublish,J Hematother Stem Cell Res. 2001 Oct;10(5):609-20. doi: 10.1089/152581601753193823.,,,,,PMC4009687,,,,,,,['NIHMS575074'],,,,,,,,

Cladribine treatment induced mitochondrial transmembrane potential (DeltaPsi(m)) loss, phosphatidylserine exposure, caspase activation and development of typical apoptotic morphology in JM1 (pre-B), Jurkat (T) and U937 (promonocytic) cells. Western-blot analysis of cell extracts revealed the activation of at least caspases 3, 6, 8 and 9. Co-treatment with Z-VAD-fmk (benzyloxy-carbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone), a general caspase inhibitor, significantly prevented cladribine-induced death in JM1 and Jurkat cells for the first approximately 40 h, but not for longer times. Z-VAD-fmk also partly prevented some morphological and biochemical features of apoptosis in U937 cells, but not cell death. Co-incubation with selective caspase inhibitors Ac-DEVD-CHO (N-acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-aldehyde), Ac-LEHD-CHO (N-acetyl-Leu-Glu-His-Asp-aldehyde) or Z-IETD-fmk (benzyloxycarbonyl-Ile-Glu-Thr-Asp-fluoromethylketone), inhibition of protein synthesis with cycloheximide or cell-cycle arrest with aphidicolin did not prevent cell death. Overexpression of Bcl-2, but not CrmA, efficiently prevented death in Jurkat cells. In all cell lines, death was always preceded by Delta Psi(m) loss and accompanied by the translocation of the protein apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) from mitochondria to the nucleus. These results suggest that caspases are differentially involved in induction and execution of apoptosis depending on the leukaemic cell lineage. In any case, Delta Psi(m) loss marked the point of no return in apoptosis and may be caused by two different pathways, one caspase-dependent and the other caspase-independent. Execution of apoptosis was always performed after Delta Psi(m) loss by a caspase-9-triggered caspase cascade and the action of AIF.","['Marzo, I', 'Perez-Galan, P', 'Giraldo, P', 'Rubio-Felix, D', 'Anel, A', 'Naval, J']","['Marzo I', 'Perez-Galan P', 'Giraldo P', 'Rubio-Felix D', 'Anel A', 'Naval J']","['Departamento de Bioquimica y Biologia Molecular y Celular, Facultad de Ciencias, Universidad de Zaragoza, 50009 Zaragoza, Spain.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['0 (Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Protein Synthesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Serpins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '0 (benzyloxycarbonylvalyl-alanyl-aspartyl fluoromethyl ketone)', '38966-21-1 (Aphidicolin)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)', '96282-35-8 (interleukin-1beta-converting enzyme inhibitor)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Active Transport, Cell Nucleus/physiology', 'Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Aphidicolin/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cladribine/*pharmacology', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Membrane Potentials/physiology', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects/physiology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Protein Synthesis Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Serpins/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', '*Viral Proteins']",2001/10/24 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/10/24 10:00'],"['2001/10/24 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/24 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1042/0264-6021:3590537 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochem J. 2001 Nov 1;359(Pt 3):537-46. doi: 10.1042/0264-6021:3590537.,,,,,PMC1222174,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In all cases, the Pt coordination plane and L are mutually twisted with angles between planes of 50-68 degrees. Bulky quinoline in 3 produces intramolecular steric strain as evidenced by a short, nonbonding Pt.H8(quin) contact of 2.77 A and concomitantly distorted Pt-N(quin)-C bond angles.

In addition, the presence of the planar ligand greatly enhanced the activity of all of the compounds in cells resistant to cisplatin, cis-[PtCl(2)(NH(3))(2)] (1).

Because IL-17 is found at high levels in the synovial fluid surrounding cartilage in patients with inflammatory arthritis, the present study determined the direct effect of IL-17 on articular cartilage. As shown herein, IL-17 was a direct and potent inducer of matrix breakdown and an inhibitor of matrix synthesis in articular cartilage explants. These effects were mediated in part by leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), but did not depend on interleukin-1 activity. The mechanism whereby IL-17 induced matrix breakdown in cartilage tissue appeared to be due to stimulation of activity of aggrecanase(s), not matrix metalloproteinase(s). However, IL-17 upregulated expression of matrix metalloproteinase(s) in chondrocytes cultured in monolayer. In vivo, IL-17 induced a phenotype similar to inflammatory arthritis when injected into the intra-articular space of mouse knee joints. Furthermore, a related protein, IL-17E, was found to have catabolic activity on human articular cartilage. This study characterizes the mechanism whereby IL-17 acts directly on cartilage matrix turnover. Such findings have important implications for the treatment of degenerative joint diseases such as arthritis.","['Cai, L', 'Yin, J P', 'Starovasnik, M A', 'Hogue, D A', 'Hillan, K J', 'Mort, J S', 'Filvaroff, E H']","['Cai L', 'Yin JP', 'Starovasnik MA', 'Hogue DA', 'Hillan KJ', 'Mort JS', 'Filvaroff EH']","['Department of Molecular Oncology, Genentech Inc., 1 DNA Way, South San Francisco, CA 94080, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Cytokine,Cytokine,9005353,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukin-17)', '0 (Proteoglycans)', '31C4KY9ESH (Nitric Oxide)', 'EC 3.4.- (Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (Matrix Metalloproteinases)', 'EC 3.4.99.- (aggrecanase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cartilage, Articular/cytology/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Cattle', 'Chondrocytes/drug effects/metabolism', 'Culture Techniques', 'Cytokines/pharmacology', 'Endopeptidases/metabolism', 'Female', 'Injections, Intra-Articular', 'Interleukin-17/*pharmacology', 'Matrix Metalloproteinases/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Nitric Oxide/physiology', 'Patella/metabolism', 'Proteoglycans/drug effects/metabolism', 'Swine', 'Up-Regulation']",2001/10/24 10:00,2002/01/26 10:01,['2001/10/24 10:00'],"['2001/10/24 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/26 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/24 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1006/cyto.2001.0939 [doi]', 'S1043466601909391 [pii]']",ppublish,Cytokine. 2001 Oct 7;16(1):10-21. doi: 10.1006/cyto.2001.0939.,['Copyright 2001 Academic Press.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Upon activation they influence cytoskeletal integrity and erythrocyte functions. In this study we report for the first time the presence of PKC iota and PKC mu in addition to PKC alpha and zeta in human erythrocytes. All isoforms were present only in the cytosolic fraction. PKC alpha was the only isoform that translocated to the membrane upon stimulation with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA). It could thus mediate several of the reported PMA-regulated membrane modifications.

In an attempt to determine the results provided by palliative treatment with oral 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) in the above hematological condition, 30 such patients were analyzed for hospital stay, days of intravenous (i.v.) antibiotics, transfusion requirements, response rate, and survival. Thirty patients with nonlymphoid BC matched for their initial characteristics and treated with different i.v. regimens were used for comparison purposes. Patients managed with 6-MP spent less days in hospital (median: 9, range: 0-46 vs median: 42, range: 5-140; P<0.0001), needed antibiotics for less days (median: 0. range: 0-46 vs median: 20, range: 0-57; P<0.0001), and received less platelet transfusions (median: 0, range: 0-20 vs median: 6, range: 0-63; P=0.004) than those treated with i.v. chemotherapy. Although no complete or partial remission was achieved by patients receiving 6-MP vs six in the i.v. chemotherapy group, no significant difference was observed when the survival of both groups was compared (median: 4.7 months, range: 0.1-22.7 vs median: 3.8 months, range: 0.2-12, respectively). These results indicate that 6-MP therapy constitutes a good palliative treatment for patients with nonlymphoid BC of CML.

They accounted for 28% (26 of 94) of the patients with B-lineage ALL. Compared with the other 88 ALL patients, the leukemic cells from all but one Ph-positive ALL patients were early pre-B cells with a higher rate of CD34 expression (92% vs 50%, P<0.05). At presentation, the Ph-positive adult ALL patients had higher circulating blasts (mean 21.4 vs 3.66x10(4)/microl, P<0.05) and lower initial platelet counts (mean 4.47 vs 7.34x10(4)/microl, P<0.01) and showed a trend toward higher frequency of initial central nerve system (CNS) involvement (25% vs 11%, P=0.098) than the others. Among patients with adequate chemotherapy, 16 (64%) of the 25 Ph-positive ALL patients achieved complete remission (CR), an incidence marginally lower than that of Ph-negative ALL (62 of 76, 82%, P=0.06) and significantly lower than that of Ph-negative B-lineage ALL (50 of 58, 86%, P=0.0037). However, all patients relapsed except for those who received allogeneic hemopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). The probabilities of 5-year continuous CR and 5-year survival for Ph-positive adult ALL patients were significantly inferior to those for Ph-negative adult ALL patients (0% vs 12%, P=0.0001, and 7% vs 19%, P=0.047, respectively), and those for Ph-negative B-lineage ALL (0% vs 14%, P<0.0001, and 7% vs 23%, P=0.002, respectively). Prognostic factors were analyzed among the Ph-positive ALL patients including the 26 adults mentioned above and an additional 11 children. No clinical or biological characteristics such as age, sex, initial circulating blast count, extramedullary involvement, or CD34 expression had an impact on the disease outcome. Allo-HSCT in first CR may improve the probability of 5-year continuous CR (100% vs. 0% for those without allo-HSCT, P=0.0091) although only three patients received it in this study. In conclusion, Ph-positive ALL patients tended to have a poor prognosis, regardless of whether other possible risk factors were present or not.

Cachexia has often been observed in experimental animals with bone metastases, and parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) plays an important role in the formation of such metastases. We therefore investigated the possible involvement of PTHrP in an experimental cachexia model using human lung-cancer cells (HARA-B). HARA-B cells produce a high amount of PTHrP but no TNF-alpha, IL-6 or leukemia inhibitory factor. The s.c. inoculation of HARA-B cells into nude mice caused reductions in body weight, adipose tissue weight, muscle weight and serum glucose levels. Serum levels of calcium and PTHrP increased. Neutralization of PTHrP with antibody caused rapid weight gain along with a rapid decrease in serum calcium levels. Our findings suggest that PTHrP plays an important role in the development of cancer cachexia. PTHrP therefore is a possible target molecule for the treatment of cancer cachexia.","['Iguchi, H', 'Onuma, E', 'Sato, K', 'Sato, K', 'Ogata, E']","['Iguchi H', 'Onuma E', 'Sato K', 'Sato K', 'Ogata E']","['National Kyushu Cancer Center Research Institute, Notame 3-1-1, Minami-ku, Fukuoka 811-1395, Japan. higuchi@nk-cc.go.jp']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Parathyroid Hormone-Related Protein)', '0 (Proteins)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Body Weight', 'Bone Neoplasms/*secondary', 'Cachexia/*etiology/therapy', 'Calcium/blood', 'Cytokines/biosynthesis', 'Lung Neoplasms/*complications', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Parathyroid Hormone-Related Protein', 'Proteins/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/10/23 10:00,2001/11/03 10:01,['2001/10/23 10:00'],"['2001/10/23 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/11/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/23 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/ijc.1425 [doi]', '10.1002/ijc.1425 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2001 Oct 1;94(1):24-7. doi: 10.1002/ijc.1425.,"['Copyright 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because the mechanisms of Chlamydia-induced changes leading to ReA are poorly defined, this study sought to identify the target genes involved at the molecular level. METHODS: Chlamydia-induced changes in host cells were investigated by combining a screening technique, which utilized complementary DNA arrays on C trachomatis-infected and mock-infected epithelial HeLa cells, with real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay of gene products. Some responses were additionally demonstrated on human primary chondrocytes and a human synovial fibroblast cell line, both of which served as model cells for ReA. RESULTS: Eighteen genes (of 1,176) were found to be up-regulated after 24 hours of infection with this obligate intracellular bacterium, among them the glycoprotein 130 family members IL-11 and LIF, the chemokine gene MIP2-alpha, the transcription factor genes EGR1, ETR101, FRA1, and c-jun, the apoptosis-related genes IEX-1L and MCL-1, adhesion molecule genes such as ICAM1, and various other functionally important genes. In the context of this rheumatic disease, the cytokines and transcription factors seem to be especially involved, since various connections to chondrocytes, synoviocytes, bone remodeling, joint pathology, and other rheumatic diseases have been demonstrated. CONCLUSION: Infection with C trachomatis seems to reprogram the host cells (independent of activation by lipopolysaccharide or other ultraviolet-resistant bacterial components) at various key positions that act as intra- or intercellular switches, suggesting that these changes and similar Chlamydia-induced functional alterations constitute an important basis of the pathogenic inflammatory potential of these cells in ReA. Our results suggest that this approach is generally useful for the broad analysis of host-pathogen interactions involving obligate intracellular bacteria, and for the identification of target genes for therapeutic intervention in this rheumatic disease.","['Hess, S', 'Rheinheimer, C', 'Tidow, F', 'Bartling, G', 'Kaps, C', 'Lauber, J', 'Buer, J', 'Klos, A']","['Hess S', 'Rheinheimer C', 'Tidow F', 'Bartling G', 'Kaps C', 'Lauber J', 'Buer J', 'Klos A']","['Medical School Hannover, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Arthritis Rheum,Arthritis and rheumatism,0370605,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (IER3 protein, human)', '0 (Immediate-Early Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (PHB2 protein, human)', '0 (Prohibitins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/genetics', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/genetics', 'Chlamydia Infections/*genetics/pathology', '*Chlamydia trachomatis', 'Cytokines/*genetics', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Immediate-Early Proteins/*genetics', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*genetics', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Prohibitins', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Up-Regulation']",2001/10/23 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/10/23 10:00'],"['2001/10/23 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/23 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1529-0131(200110)44:10<2392::aid-art404>3.0.co;2-i [doi]'],ppublish,Arthritis Rheum. 2001 Oct;44(10):2392-401. doi: 10.1002/1529-0131(200110)44:10<2392::aid-art404>3.0.co;2-i.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, consensus has been difficult to establish, and although a scheme is now available, objective criteria are desirable. Genetic technology will underpin and extend current knowledge, and it is certain to reveal further subdivisions of current tumor categories. The Ig variable region genes of B cell tumors present a considerable asset for this area of investigation. The unique sequences carried in neoplastic B cells are easily isolated and sequenced. In addition to acting as clone-specific markers of each tumor, they indicate where the cell has come from and track its history following transformation. There is emerging clinical value in knowing whether the cell of origin has encountered antigen and has moved from the naive compartment to the germinal center, where somatic mutation is activated. This is amply illustrated by the subdivision of chronic lymphocytic leukemia into two subsets, unmutated or mutated, each with very different prognosis. Other tumors may be subdivided in a similar way. Microarray technology is developing rapidly to probe gene expression and to further divide tumor categories. All these genetic analyses will provide objective data to enhance both our understanding of B cell tumors and our ability to treat them.","['Stevenson, F K', 'Sahota, S S', 'Ottensmeier, C H', 'Zhu, D', 'Forconi, F', 'Hamblin, T J']","['Stevenson FK', 'Sahota SS', 'Ottensmeier CH', 'Zhu D', 'Forconi F', 'Hamblin TJ']","['Tenovus Laboratory, Southampton University Hospitals Trust, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Adv Cancer Res,Advances in cancer research,0370416,['0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)'],IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/pathology', 'Chromosomes/ultrastructure', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/*genetics', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/genetics', 'Models, Biological', 'Models, Genetic', 'Multiple Myeloma/genetics', '*Mutation', 'Prognosis', 'Recombination, Genetic', 'Time Factors', 'Translocation, Genetic']",2001/10/23 10:00,2002/03/12 10:01,['2001/10/23 10:00'],"['2001/10/23 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/12 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/23 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0065-230X(01)83004-9 [pii]', '10.1016/s0065-230x(01)83004-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Adv Cancer Res. 2001;83:81-116. doi: 10.1016/s0065-230x(01)83004-9.,,195,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In 1999 and 2000, an Institute of Medicine committee studied the issues related to coverage for certain services, including ""medically necessary dental services."" METHODS: The committee conducted a literature search for dental care studies in five areas: head and neck cancer, leukemia, lymphoma, organ transplantation, and heart valve repair or replacement. The committee examined evidence to support Medicare coverage for dental services related to these conditions and estimated the cost to Medicare of such coverage. RESULTS: Evidence supported Medicare coverage for preventive dental care before jaw radiation therapy for head or neck cancer and coverage for treatment to prevent or eliminate acute oral infections for patients with leukemia before chemotherapy. Insufficient evidence supported dental coverage for patients with lymphoma or organ transplants and for patients who had undergone heart valve repair or replacement. CONCLUSIONS: The committee suggested that Congress update statutory language to permit Medicare coverage of effective dental services needed in conjunction with surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy or pharmacological treatment for life-threatening medical conditions. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Dental care is important for members of all age groups. More direct, research-based evidence on the efficacy of medically necessary dental care is needed both to guide treatment and to support Medicare payment policy.","['Patton, L L', 'White, B A', 'Field, M J']","['Patton LL', 'White BA', 'Field MJ']","['Department of Dental Ecology, School of Dentistry, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, CB 7450, Chapel Hill, N.C. 27514, USA.

Among these isoflavonoids, tectorigenin and genistein exhibited cytotoxicity against various human cancer cells; glycitein showed only mild cytotoxicity. These results suggest that the isoflavone structure and 5-hydroxyl group are crucial for the cytotoxic properties and that glycosides are inactive. Moreover, tectorigenin induced differentiation of human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells to granulocytes and monocytes/macrophages, and caused apoptotic changes of DNA in the cells, as did genistein. Tectorigenin also inhibited autophosphorylation of epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor by EGF and decreased the expression of Bcl-2 protein, with less activity than genistein. From these results, tectorigenin may be a possible therapeutic agent for leukemia.","['Lee, K T', 'Sohn, I C', 'Kim, Y K', 'Choi, J H', 'Choi, J W', 'Park, H J', 'Itoh, Y', 'Miyamoto, K']","['Lee KT', 'Sohn IC', 'Kim YK', 'Choi JH', 'Choi JW', 'Park HJ', 'Itoh Y', 'Miyamoto K']","['College of Pharmacy, Kyung Hee University, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Biol Pharm Bull,Biological & pharmaceutical bulletin,9311984,"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal)', '0 (Isoflavones)', '855130H9CO (tectorigenin)', 'DH2M523P0H (Genistein)']",IM,"['Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Genes, bcl-1/drug effects', 'Genistein/chemistry/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Isoflavones/*pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Plants, Medicinal/*chemistry', 'Pueraria/*chemistry', 'Spectrometry, Fluorescence', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",2001/10/20 10:00,2002/03/20 10:01,['2001/10/20 10:00'],"['2001/10/20 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/20 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/20 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1248/bpb.24.1117 [doi]'],ppublish,Biol Pharm Bull. 2001 Oct;24(10):1117-21. doi: 10.1248/bpb.24.1117.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The sequencing of the thymidine kinase (TK) gene did not permit to establish a relation between mutations and resistance to ACV. Three patients were considered as clinically cured of their HSV infection by replacement of ACV or foscarnet with either valacyclovir (one case) or cidofovir (two cases) but eventually two of them died of graft vs host disease. One patient died of extensive HSV infection despite administration of cidofovir.

The antiproliferative activity of AME was compared to that of the standard cytotoxic agent doxorubicin (CAS 23214-92-8, adriamycin, ADR) using the sulforhodamin B, propidium iodide and soft agar colony forming assays, respectively. AME was highly cytotoxic in solid human tumors with mean IC70 values in the range of 0.17-1 ng ML/ml (2.8-17 pmol bioactive ML). On a molar basis, AME was 3 to 4 logs more potent than ADR and showed differential cytotoxicity towards tumors of the breast, small cell and non-small cell lung, prostate and renal cell cancers. AME was also highly active in hematological malignancies with steep dose response curves resulting in mean IC70 values of 0.12 ng ML/ml (2 pmol). The acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line HL-60 was the most sensitive, the histiocytic lymphoma cell line U937 the most resistant hematological malignancy. It is important to stress that AME did not induce a biologically relevant increase of cell proliferation in any of the tumor cell lines tested. Our data suggest that AME has in vitro antitumor profiles similar to those of classical anticancer agents. Clear dose-response relationships were found in all of the performed experiments and interesting differential cytotoxicity patterns were observed.

Stable transfer of hCNT2 cDNA into CEM-ARAC enabled Na(+)-dependent transport of purine and pyrimidine nucleoside analogs and provided a unique in vitro model for studying hCNT2. Analysis of [(3)H]uridine inhibitory activity by test substances in hCNT2 transfectant ARAC/D2 revealed structural requirements for interaction with hCNT2: 1) ribosyl and 2'-deoxyribosyl nucleosides were better inhibitors than 3'-deoxyribosyl, 2',3'-dideoxyribosyl or arabinosyl nucleosides; 2) uridine analogs with halogens at position 5 were better inhibitors than 5-methyluridine or thymidine; 3) 2-chloroadenosine was a better inhibitor than 2-chloro-2'-deoxyadenosine (cladribine); and 4) cytosine-containing nucleosides, 7-deazaadenosine and nucleobases were not inhibitors. Quantification of inhibitory capacity yielded K(i) values of 34-50 microM (5-halogenated uridine analogs, 2'-deoxyuridine), 82 microM (5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine), 197-246 microM (5-methyluridine < 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine < 5-iodo-2'-deoxyuridine), and 411 microM (5-fluoro-5'-deoxyuridine, capecitabine metabolite). Comparisons of hCNT2-mediated transport rates indicated halogenated uridine analogs were transported more rapidly than halogenated adenosine analogs, even though hCNT2 exhibited preference for physiologic purine nucleosides over uridine. Kinetics of hCNT2-mediated transport of 5-fluorouridine and uridine were similar (K(m) values, 43-46 microM). The impact of hCNT2-mediated transport on chemosensitivity was assessed by comparing antiproliferative activity of nucleoside analogs against hCNT2-containing cells with transport-defective, drug-resistant cells. Chemosensitivity was restored partially for cladribine, completely for 5-fluorouridine and 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine, whereas there was little effect on chemosensitivity for fludarabine, 7-deazaadenosine, or cytarabine. These studies, which demonstrated hCNT2 uptake of halogenated uridine analogs, suggested that hCNT2 is an important determinant of cytotoxicity of this class of compounds in vivo.","['Lang, T T', 'Selner, M', 'Young, J D', 'Cass, C E']","['Lang TT', 'Selner M', 'Young JD', 'Cass CE']","['Canadian Institute of Health Research Membrane Protein Research Group, University of Alberta.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Equilibrative Nucleoside Transporter 1)', '0 (Halogens)', '0 (Membrane Transport Proteins)', '0 (Purine Nucleosides)', '0 (Pyrimidine Nucleosides)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (SLC29A1 protein, human)', '0 (cif nucleoside transporter)', '039LU44I5M (Floxuridine)', '4K0M952561 (5-fluorouridine)', '9NEZ333N27 (Sodium)', 'WHI7HQ7H85 (Uridine)']",IM,"['Biological Transport/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Equilibrative Nucleoside Transporter 1', 'Floxuridine/*pharmacology', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Halogens/chemistry', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Membrane Transport Proteins/drug effects/genetics/*metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Purine Nucleosides/chemistry/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Pyrimidine Nucleosides/chemistry/metabolism/pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Sodium/metabolism', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Uridine/*analogs & derivatives/chemistry/metabolism/*pharmacology']",2001/10/20 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/10/20 10:00'],"['2001/10/20 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/20 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1124/mol.60.5.1143 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 2001 Nov;60(5):1143-52. doi: 10.1124/mol.60.5.1143.,,,,,,,,,"['GENBANK/AF029358', 'GENBANK/AF036109', 'GENBANK/AF305210', 'GENBANK/U62966', 'GENBANK/U81375']",,,,,,,,,,,

The relative DNA affinity of the test compounds containing an indolo[2,3-b]quinoxaline, pyridopyrazino[2,3-b]indoles or pyrazino[2,3-b]indole planar chromophore varies significantly depending on the nature of the side chain grafted onto the indole nitrogen. Compounds with a dimethylaminoethyl chain strongly bind to DNA and exhibit a preference for GC-rich DNA sequences, as revealed by DNase I footprinting. Weaker DNA interactions were detected with those bearing a morpholinoethyl side chain. The incorporation of a 2,3-dihydroxypropyl side chain does not reinforce the DNA interaction compared with the unsubstituted analogues.

Thus, 465* represents the natural amino acid sequence 1-465 followed by 21 novel amino acids starting at position 466. The entire ligand binding domain is missing. Prior studies have shown that transient transfection of the glucocorticoid-resistant leukemic T-cell clone ICR-27 with a plasmid expressing 465* rapidly reduces the number of viable cells. This response does not require activation by a steroid, and a hybrid protein consisting of green fluorescent protein fused to 465* is found primarily in the cytoplasm. In the present study, we present evidence that the decrease in cell number is due to a form of cell death that bears many of the classic characteristics of apoptosis. Expression of the 465* protein can be detected a few hours after electroporation and is followed by activation of caspase-3 as well as reduction of the mitochondrial inner transmembrane potential. The caspase-3 inhibitor ZVAD-fmk blocks 465*-dependent cell death when added acutely after electroporation, but fails to do so later. We conclude that the novel 465* gene causes cell death by apoptosis.","['El-Naghy, M', 'Johnson, B H', 'Chen, H', 'Ansari, N H', 'Zhang, W', 'Moller, P', 'Ji Ys', 'Thompson, E B']","['El-Naghy M', 'Johnson BH', 'Chen H', 'Ansari NH', 'Zhang W', 'Moller P', 'Ji Ys', 'Thompson EB']","['Department of Internal Medicine, State University of New York at Stony Brook, East Meadow, New York 11554,USA.']",['eng'],['R01 CA41407/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Indicators and Reagents)', '0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Receptors, Glucocorticoid)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Child', 'Chromatin/ultrastructure', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'Humans', 'Indicators and Reagents/metabolism', '*Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell', 'Luminescent Proteins/genetics', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Mitochondria/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Mutagenesis/physiology', 'Peptide Fragments/genetics', 'Plasmids', 'Receptors, Glucocorticoid/*genetics', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/10/20 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/10/20 10:00'],"['2001/10/20 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/20 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1006/excr.2001.5350 [doi]', 'S0014482701953509 [pii]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 2001 Nov 1;270(2):166-75. doi: 10.1006/excr.2001.5350.,['Copyright 2001 Academic Press.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Study of these two groups of diseases has revealed general truths about the nature of the neoplastic process. Cytogenetic analysis has demonstrated that haematological neoplasms result from a somatic mutation occurring in a haemopoietic, lymphoid or multipotent stem cell. Complete remission has been related to disappearance of the clone of cells bearing the mutation whereas the occurrence of clonal evolution has often been found to be indicative of increasingly aggressive disease. Cytogenetic analysis of leukaemias and lymphomas has led to the discovery of numerous proto-oncogenes; these generally play a crucial role in proliferation and differentiation of normal cells with a perturbation of their function leading to neoplasia. In addition, cytogenetic evidence has suggested a role for loss of function of cancer-suppressing genes in haematological neoplasms. Cytogenetic analysis has also made major contributions to precise diagnosis and to the assigning of prognosis and, furthermore, by identifying good and poor prognostic groups has improved the management of patients. Good-prognosis patients have been spared unnecessary treatment and, conversely, more intensive treatment for some diseases associated with a cytogenetic abnormality that was previously indicative of a poor prognosis has improved the outcome for these patients.","['Bain, B J']",['Bain BJ'],"[""Department of Haematology, St Mary's Hospital, Praed Street, London, W2 1NY, UK.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,Best Pract Res Clin Haematol,Best practice & research.

From the mid 1950s onwards, experimental oncologists favored the notion that cancer was initiated by infectious agents passed from one generation to the next. In order to analyze this displacement, the present paper focuses on the part played by new experimental systems, i.e. mice showing tumors induced by viruses. Since animal models are agencies which ""represent"" human diseases, and mediate between different social worlds, their uses often result in opposing views. Mouse models thus provided tractable resources which favored the alternation between heredity and infection. The paper describes the emergence, in the late 1930s, at the Jackson Memorial Laboratory, of an agent enhancing the formation of mammary tumors in mice. This laboratory was then involved in the production of marketable inbred mice as well as in research concerned with genetic factors that may cause cancer. After World War II, loose theories and conflicting results helped turn the agent into a virus. At the National Cancer Institute, the virus was associated with a whole range of particles causing leukemia in mice. Owing to the Virus Cancer Program, the value of mouse tumor viruses increased in the late 1960s. This research effort then aimed at finding human tumor viruses, and at crafting cancer vaccines. It was modeled after the experience of the NCI chemotherapy program stemming from war research. In addition to the fact that biomedical research became a state enterprise, the study emphasizes three parameters.

He started his medical studies in 1839 and finished them in 1843. He became one of the most famous physicians of the 19th century, as he founded the ""Cellular pathology"" theory. This claims that disease and pathological change start in the cell and nowhere else. The ruling medical dogma at that time the ""humoral pathology"" stated that ""body fluids"" were in inbalance when a person got sick. Virchow's studies cleaned this out and the hallmark of the ""cellular pathology"" sounded ""omnis cellula e cellula"" (""behind every cell there is another cell""). Virchow was a Professor of Anathomy, Pathology and Physiology and was about the first medical doctor to introduce leukemia, embolus, trombosis and cancerous lymphoid glands into our vocabulary. He worked most of his time in Berlin. He was also a famous and powerful politician throughout his entire life, fighting for political rights, universal suffrage, economic reforms and loosening of the grip of the church. He was also struggling for peace and international understanding. Moreover he was engaged in Anthropology and active as an Archeologist-Historian. He was married and had 6 children. Rudolf Virchow is one of the most famous scientist of the nineteenth-century, referred to as a person of most authority by, among others, Darwin and Nietsche. He was the writer of numerous medical books, the founder of medical journals and the leader of several scientifical organizations. He died in 1902 in Berlin in the aftermath of a tramway-accident when he was on his way to an archeological scientific meeting, at 81 years of age.","['Lindkvist, L']",['Lindkvist L'],,['swe'],,"['Biography', 'Historical Article', 'Journal Article', 'Portrait']",Sweden,Sven Med Tidskr,Svensk medicinhistorisk tidskrift,9812689,,,"['Anthropology/*history', 'Germany', '*Historiography', 'History, 19th Century', '*Medicine', '*Politics']",2001/10/20 10:00,2001/10/31 10:01,['2001/10/20 10:00'],"['2001/10/20 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/31 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/20 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Sven Med Tidskr. 1999;3(1):57-82.,,,,"Rudolf Virchow 1821-1902.

The inhibition of growth related kinases, especially tyrosine kinases, might provide new therapies for diseases such as cancer. The progress made in the crystallization of protein kinases has confirmed that the ATP-binding domain of tyrosine kinases is an attractive target for drug design. Three successful examples of drug design at Novartis using a tyrosine kinase as a molecular target are described. PKI166, a pyrrolo[2,3,-d]pyrimidine derivative, is a dual inhibitor of both the EGFR and the ErbB2 kinases. The compound entered clinical trials in 1999, based on its favorable preclinical profile: potent inhibition of EGF-mediated signalling in cells, in vivo antitumor activity in several EGFR overexpressing xenograft tumor models in nude mice, long-lasting inhibition of EGF-stimulated EGFR autophosphorylation in tumor tissue, good oral bioavailability in animals, and no prohibitive in vitro and in vivo toxicity findings. The anilino-phthalazine derivative PTK787/ZK222584 (Phase I, co-developed by Schering AG, Berlin) is a potent and selective inhibitor of both the KDR and Flt-1 kinases with interesting anti-angiogenic and pharmacokinetic properties (orally bioavailable). STI571 (Glivec, Gleevec), a phenylamino-pyrimidine derivative, is a potent inhibitor of the Abl tyrosine kinase, which is present in 95% of patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). The compound specifically inhibits proliferation of v-Abl and Bcr-Abl expressing cells (including cells from CML patients) and shows anti-tumor activity as a single agent in animal models at well-tolerated doses. Pharmacologically relevant concentrations are achieved in the plasma of animals (oral administration). Promising data from phase I and II clinical trials in CML patients (98% haematological response rate in Phase I) support the fact that the STI571 represents a new treatment modality for CML. In addition, potent inhibition of the PDGFR and c-Kit tyrosine kinases also indicates its possible clinical use in solid tumors.","['Traxler, P', 'Bold, G', 'Buchdunger, E', 'Caravatti, G', 'Furet, P', 'Manley, P', ""O'Reilly, T"", 'Wood, J', 'Zimmermann, J']","['Traxler P', 'Bold G', 'Buchdunger E', 'Caravatti G', 'Furet P', 'Manley P', ""O'Reilly T"", 'Wood J', 'Zimmermann J']","['Novartis Pharma AG, Oncology Research, CH-4002 Basel, Switzerland. peter.traxler@pharma.novartis.com']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Med Res Rev,Medicinal research reviews,8103150,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*chemistry/pharmacology/therapeutic use', '*Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*chemistry/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors']",2001/10/19 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/10/19 10:00'],"['2001/10/19 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/19 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/med.1022 [pii]', '10.1002/med.1022 [doi]']",ppublish,Med Res Rev. 2001 Nov;21(6):499-512. doi: 10.1002/med.1022.,"['Copyright 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.']",53,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Selective formation of multi-protein complexes by the Crk and Crk-like (CRKL) proteins depends on specific motifs recognized by their SH2 and SH3 domains. In the case of the first SH3 domains [SH3(1)] a P-x-x-P-x-K motif is crucial for highly selective binding, while the SH2 domains prefer motifs which conform to the consensus pY-x-x-P. Crk family proteins are involved in the relocalization and activation of several different effector proteins which include guanine nucleotide releasing proteins like C3G, protein kinases of the Abl- and GCK-families and small GTPases like Rap1 and Rac. Crk-type proteins have been found not only in vertebrates but also in flies and nematodes. Major insight into the function of Crk within organisms came from the genetic model organism C. elegans, where the Crk-homologue CED-2 regulates cell engulfment and phagocytosis. Other biological outcomes of the Crk-activated signal transduction cascades include the modulation of cell adhesion, cell migration and immune cell responses. Crk family adaptors also appear to play a role in mediating the action of human oncogenes like the leukaemia-inducing Bcr-Abl protein. This review summarizes some key findings and highlights recent insights and open questions.","['Feller, S M']",['Feller SM'],"['Cell Signalling Laboratory, Imperial Cancer Research Fund, University of Oxford, Institute of Molecular Medicine, John Radcliffe Hospital, Headington, Oxford OX3 9DS, UK.

These genes invariably encode intracellular proteins and in acute cancers, often involve transcription and developmental regulators, which are master regulators of cell fate (e.g. LMO2 which is involved in acute leukaemia). Chromosomal translocations are usually associated with specific cell types. The reason for this close association is under investigation using mouse models. We are trying to emulate the cell-specific consequences of chromosomal translocations in mice using homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells to generate de novo chromosomal translocations or to mimic the consequence of these translocations. In addition, chromosomal translocation genes and their products are important targets for therapy. We have designed new therapeutic strategies which include antigen-specific recruitment of endogenous cellular pathways to affect cellular viability and a novel structured form of antisense to ablate the function of fusion mRNAs. We will evaluate these procedures in the mouse models of chromosomal translocations and the long term aim is to perfect rapid procedures for characterizing patient-specific chromosomal translocations to tailor therapy to individual patients.","['Rabbitts, T H']",['Rabbitts TH'],"['MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Hills Road, Cambridge CB2 2QH, UK. thr@mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA, Complementary/metabolism', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Models, Biological', 'Models, Genetic', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasms/*genetics/*therapy', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/metabolism', 'Recombination, Genetic', '*Translocation, Genetic']",2001/10/19 10:00,2001/11/03 10:01,['2001/10/19 10:00'],"['2001/10/19 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/11/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/19 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1204597 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 2001 Sep 10;20(40):5763-77. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1204597.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These translocations result in a gain of MLL function by generating novel chimeric proteins containing the amino-terminus of MLL fused in-frame with one of 30 distinct partner proteins. Structure/function studies using an in vitro myeloid progenitor immortalization assay have revealed that at least four nuclear partner proteins contribute transcriptional effector properties to MLL to produce a range of chimeric transcription factors with leukemogenic potential. Mouse models suggest that expression of an MLL fusion protein is necessary but not sufficient for leukemogenesis.

We discuss potential mechanisms that may account for the ability of distinct MLL fusion proteins to promote short or long latency leukemogenesis.","['Ayton, P M', 'Cleary, M L']","['Ayton PM', 'Cleary ML']","['Department of Pathology, Stanford University Medical Center, 300 Pasteur Drive, Stanford, California, CA 94305, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Kmt2a protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/chemistry/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*etiology/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Models, Genetic', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/chemistry/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', '*Transcription Factors']",2001/10/19 10:00,2001/11/03 10:01,['2001/10/19 10:00'],"['2001/10/19 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/11/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/19 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1204639 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 2001 Sep 10;20(40):5695-707. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1204639.,,120,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Of the two components of each fusion protein, one is generally a transcription factor, whereas the other partner is more variable in function, but often involved in the control of cell survival and apoptosis. As a consequence, AML-associated fusion proteins function as aberrant transcriptional regulators that interfere with the process of myeloid differentiation, determine a stage-specific arrest of maturation and enhance cell survival in a cell-type specific manner. The abnormal regulation of transcriptional networks occurs through common mechanisms that include recruitment of aberrant co-repressor complexes, alterations in chromatin remodeling, and disruption of specific subnuclear compartments. The identification and analysis of common and specific target genes regulated by AML fusion proteins will be of fundamental importance for the full understanding of acute myeloid leukemogenesis and for the implementation of disease-specific drug design.","['Alcalay, M', 'Orleth, A', 'Sebastiani, C', 'Meani, N', 'Chiaradonna, F', 'Casciari, C', 'Sciurpi, M T', 'Gelmetti, V', 'Riganelli, D', 'Minucci, S', 'Fagioli, M', 'Pelicci, P G']","['Alcalay M', 'Orleth A', 'Sebastiani C', 'Meani N', 'Chiaradonna F', 'Casciari C', 'Sciurpi MT', 'Gelmetti V', 'Riganelli D', 'Minucci S', 'Fagioli M', 'Pelicci PG']","['Department of Experimental Oncology, European Institute of Oncology, 20141 Milan, Italy. malcalay@ieo.it']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Survival', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Homozygote', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*etiology/*genetics/*pathology', 'Models, Biological', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/metabolism', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', '*Translocation, Genetic']",2001/10/19 10:00,2001/11/03 10:01,['2001/10/19 10:00'],"['2001/10/19 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/11/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/19 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1204642 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 2001 Sep 10;20(40):5680-94. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1204642.,,200,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Expression decreases significantly at more mature stages of B-cell development. Activation of TCL1 and/or TCL1b in mature T-cells causes T-cell leukemia in humans. The oncogenic nature of TCL1 was confirmed by the analysis of a transgenic mouse model. Functional analysis of Tcl1 revealed its involvement in a PI3-kinase dependent Akt (PKB) pro-survival pathway through its interaction with the Akt kinase which increases Akt's enzymatic activity and promotes translocation of Akt to the nucleus.","['Pekarsky, Y', 'Hallas, C', 'Croce, C M']","['Pekarsky Y', 'Hallas C', 'Croce CM']","['Kimmel Cancer Center, Thomas Jefferson University, 233 South 10th Street Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, PA 19107, USA.

The gp190 is among the very few members of this large family to contain two CRH domains. The membrane-distal one (herein called D1) is followed by an Ig-like domain, a membrane-proximal CRH domain called D2, and three type III fibronectin repeats. We raised a series of monoclonal antibodies specific for the human gp190. Among them was the blocking antibody 1C7, which was directed against the D1Ig region and which impaired the binding of LIF to gp190. Another blocking antibody, called 12D3, was directed against domain D2 and interfered with the reconstitution of the high affinity receptor complex, independently of the interaction between LIF and gp190. The blocking effect of these two antibodies concerned four cytokines known to use gp190, i.e. LIF, oncostatin M, ciliary neurotrophic factor, and cardiotrophin-1. Among 23 antibodies tested alone or in combination (two anti-D2 and 21 anti-D1Ig), only the mixture of the two anti-D2 antibodies displayed agonistic activity in the absence of the cytokine. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the two CRH domains of gp190 play different functions in ligand binding and receptor activation.","['Taupin, J L', 'Legembre, P', 'Bitard, J', 'Daburon, S', 'Pitard, V', 'Blanchard, F', 'Duplomb, L', 'Godard, A', 'Jacques, Y', 'Moreau, J F']","['Taupin JL', 'Legembre P', 'Bitard J', 'Daburon S', 'Pitard V', 'Blanchard F', 'Duplomb L', 'Godard A', 'Jacques Y', 'Moreau JF']","['CNRS UMR 5540, Universite de Bordeaux II, Batiment 1b, 146 rue Leo-Saignat, 33076 Bordeaux Cedex, France. jean-luc.taupin@umr5540.u-bordeaux2.fr']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (LIFR protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology', 'Cell Division/physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Cricetinae', 'Cytokines/*metabolism/physiology', 'Epitopes/immunology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit', 'Receptors, Cytokine/chemistry/*immunology/metabolism', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",2001/10/19 10:00,2002/02/01 10:01,['2001/10/19 10:00'],"['2001/10/19 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/02/01 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/19 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M105476200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)40308-6 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2001 Dec 21;276(51):47975-81. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M105476200.

Both the oncogene Bcr-Abl and physiological growth factors such as interleukin (IL)-3 can modulate the outcome of cellular exposure to DNA damage. To determine whether Bcr-Abl and growth factors can affect the p53/Mdm2 pathway, we studied the expression of Mdm2 in the IL-3-dependent pre-B cell line BaF3 and its bcr-abl-transfected derivative BaF3p185 after IL-3 deprivation or treatment with the c-Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor STI571. We found that both growth factor withdrawal and inhibition of Bcr-Abl kinase lead to a down-regulation of Mdm2 preceding the induction of apoptosis. Apoptotic cell death induced by STI571 is partially dependent on p53. The early decrease of Mdm2 protein was not attributable to transcriptional regulation or to caspase-mediated cleavage. On the other hand, it could be completely blocked by the proteasomal inhibitor lactacystin. Targeted down-regulation of Mdm2 protein by antisense oligodeoxynucleotides overcame the survival effects of IL-3 and Bcr-Abl and resulted in accelerated apoptosis. Taken together, survival signals provided either by physiological growth factors or by oncogenic Bcr-Abl can positively regulate Mdm2, whereas Mdm2 ablation can reduce cell survival. These findings imply that, similarly to physiological growth factors such as IL-3, Bcr-Abl can promote cell survival through modulating the p53-Mdm2 pathway.","['Goetz, A W', 'van der Kuip, H', 'Maya, R', 'Oren, M', 'Aulitzky, W E']","['Goetz AW', 'van der Kuip H', 'Maya R', 'Oren M', 'Aulitzky WE']","['Dr. Margarete Fischer-Bosch Institute for Clinical Pharmacology, Stuttgart, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Multienzyme Complexes)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (MDM2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects/physiology', 'B-Lymphocytes/drug effects/metabolism/*physiology', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/physiology', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation/*drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology/*physiology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics', 'Megakaryocytes/drug effects/metabolism/*physiology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Multienzyme Complexes/metabolism', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/pharmacology', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'Transfection']",2001/10/19 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/10/19 10:00'],"['2001/10/19 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/19 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 2001 Oct 15;61(20):7635-41.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The key step involved the reaction between [2-(p-methoxyphenyloxy)ethoxy]methyl chloride and N(9)-tritylated nucleobases 6 or 11 followed by concomitant self-detritylation. N(7)-Guanine acyclic nucleoside 9 exhibited antiviral activity, but was phosphorylated by both HSV and Vero cell thymidine kinases. Thus, it showed more potent cellular toxicity than acyclovir (2). N(7)-Adenine acyclic nucleoside 14 was found to be an excellent antiviral agent as well as a good inhibitor of calf mucosal adenosine deaminase. This inhibitory property allows for a greater expression of antiviral activity of antiviral agents, such as N(9)-adenine acyclic nucleoside 1 and ara-A (3). Compound 14 was phosphorylated neither by herpes simplex virus (HSV) thymidine kinase nor by Vero cell thymidine kinase, yet it enhanced the rate constant for the monophosphorylation of acyclovir (2) by HSV thymidine kinase. Consequently, the combination of acyclovir (2) and 14 exhibited greater antiviral activity than acyclovir alone. 7-[2-(Phosphonomethoxy)ethyl]adenine (20) was also synthesized. The key step involved the reaction of 9-(2-cyanoethyl)adenine (15) with methyl iodoacetate in the presence of lithium 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine in THF. Unlike 9-[2-(phosphonomethoxy)ethyl]adenine (PMEA, 4), the N(7)-isomer 20 was not phosphorylated effectively by 5-phosphoribosyl 1-pyrophosphate synthetase (PRPP synthetase). Thus, it did not exhibit pronounced antiviral activity. Dinucleotide 5'-monophosphate 24 and its butenolide ester 25 were also synthesized. Compound 24 showed substrate activity toward PRPP synthetase and exhibited notable activity against DNA viruses. The antiviral activity of the ester derivative 25 was found to be higher than that of the parent molecule 24. Dinucleotide 5'-monophosphate 24 is susceptible to degradation by snake venom and spleen phosphodiesterases. However, its respective butenolide ester derivative 25 was completely resistant to snake venom and spleen enzymes. Butenolide ester derivatives 28 and 29 were also synthesized and exhibited notable anti-DNA virus and anti-retrovirus activity in vitro. Compounds 2, 4, 9, 14, 20, 24, 25, and 28 were also evaluated for their inhibitory effect on HSV-1-induced mortality in NMRI mice.

The derivatives were composed of a spermine fragment covalently tethered at its N4 and N9 positions to an aromatic nucleus via an aliphatic chain (e.g., 8: acridine -[C4 aliphatic tether]-spermine-[C4 aliphatic tether]-acridine). The distance separating the spermine and aromatic nuclei was altered via different tethers composed of four or five methylene units. These bis ligands (8, 9, 12, and 13) were shown to inhibit human DNA topoisomerase II (topo II) activity at 5 microM. Enzymatic activity was assessed as the ability to unknot (decatenate) and cleave kinetoplast DNA (kDNA). Polyamine conjugation did not disrupt the ability of the acridine-spermine conjugates 8 and 9 to inhibit topo II activity as compared with the 9-aminoacridine and 9-(N-butyl)aminoacridine controls (at 5 microM). The parent polyamines, spermine (5 microM) and spermidine (10 microM), had little effect on topo II activity. In general, the bis-substituted spermine derivatives (8, 9, 12, and 13) were more efficient topo II inhibitors at 5 microM than their monosubstituted spermidine counterparts (22-25) at 10 microM. Within the bisintercalator spermine series, insertion of an additional methylene unit (i.e., C5 tethers) increased potency 2-fold (8, bis-C4-acridine, 47 h IC(50) = 40 microM; 9, bis-C5-acridine, IC(50) = 17 microM). Comparison of the bis- and monoacridine spermine motifs (8 and 17) revealed a 4-fold increase in potency for the latter architecture (94 h IC(50) for 8, 74 microM; for 17, 17 microM). In general the bisintercalators (8, 9, 12, and 13) behaved as cytostatic agents, while the monosubstituted acridine and anthracene derivatives (22-25) were cytotoxic. Anthracene-containing conjugates were generally more toxic than their acridine counterparts in an L1210 (murine leukemia) cell assay. Of the conjugates tested the (monointercalator)-spermine motif (e.g., 17) had the highest affinity for the L1210 polyamine transporter as revealed by spermidine protection experiments.","['Wang, L', 'Price, H L', 'Juusola, J', 'Kline, M', 'Phanstiel, O 4th']","['Wang L', 'Price HL', 'Juusola J', 'Kline M', 'Phanstiel O 4th']","['Center for Discovery of Drugs and Diagnostics, Department of Chemistry, University of Central Florida, Orlando, FL 32816-2366, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry,9716531,"['0 (Acridines)', '0 (Anthracenes)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA, Kinetoplast)', '0 (Intercalating Agents)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '2FZ7Y3VOQX (Spermine)']",IM,"['Acridines/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Anthracenes/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Biological Transport, Active', 'Crithidia fasciculata', 'DNA, Kinetoplast/chemistry', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Intercalating Agents/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Spermine/*analogs & derivatives/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', '*Topoisomerase II Inhibitors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/10/19 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/10/19 10:00'],"['2001/10/19 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/19 10:00 [entrez]']","['jm010181v [pii]', '10.1021/jm010181v [doi]']",ppublish,J Med Chem. 2001 Oct 25;44(22):3682-91. doi: 10.1021/jm010181v.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In human leukocyte antigen (HLA) haplotype-mismatched transplants, extensive T-cell depletion of the graft is essential to prevent GVHD. This raises the question of whether mismatched transplants exert any GVL effect and whether it will ever be possible to reduce the intensity of preparative regimens. Because natural killer (NK) cells are negatively regulated by MHC class I-specific inhibitory receptors, mismatched transplants may trigger NK-cell alloreactivity. HLA class I disparities driving NK-cell alloreactions in the GVH direction mediate strong GVL effects, produce higher engraftment rates, and do not cause GVHD. In murine MHC-mismatched transplant models with no donor T-cell reactivity against the recipient, the pre-transplant infusion of donor-vs-recipient alloreactive NK cells conditioned the recipients to bone marrow transplantation without GVHD. NK-cell alloreactivity may be a unique therapeutic tool for tolerance induction and clearance of leukemia in hematopoietic transplantation.","['Ruggeri, L', 'Capanni, M', 'Martelli, M F', 'Velardi, A']","['Ruggeri L', 'Capanni M', 'Martelli MF', 'Velardi A']","['Division of Hematology and Clinical Immunology, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,,IM,"['Animals', 'Graft vs Tumor Effect/immunology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology/transplantation', 'Lymphocyte Depletion', 'Transplantation, Homologous/immunology']",2001/10/18 10:00,2002/05/09 10:01,['2001/10/18 10:00'],"['2001/10/18 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/05/09 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/18 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00062752-200111000-00007 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2001 Nov;8(6):355-9. doi: 10.1097/00062752-200111000-00007.,,35,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Response rates and durability appear lower with myeloma and acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplasia syndrome, and minimal with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. There is relatively little data on indolent lymphoid malignancies. Issues that remain to be resolved include the precise nature of the effector cells and their target antigens, the best strategies for separating graft-versus-malignancy from graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and their effect on the durability of responses, and the role of adjuvant chemotherapy/cytokines.

In addition, a fusion between HIP1 and platelet-derived growth factor beta receptor causes chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. The HIP1 proteins, including HIP1 and HIP1-related (HIP1r), have an N-terminal polyphosphoinositide-interacting epsin N-terminal homology, domain, which is found in proteins involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. HIP1 and HIP1r also share a central leucine zipper and an actin binding TALIN homology domain. Here we show that HIP1, like HIP1r, colocalizes with clathrin coat components. We also show that HIP1 physically associates with clathrin and AP-2, the major components of the clathrin coat. To further understand the putative biological role(s) of HIP1, we have generated a targeted deletion of murine HIP1. HIP1(-/-) mice developed into adulthood, did not develop overt neurologic symptoms in the first year of life, and had normal peripheral blood counts. However, HIP1-deficient mice exhibited testicular degeneration with increased apoptosis of postmeiotic spermatids. Postmeiotic spermatids are the only cells of the seminiferous tubules that express HIP1. These findings indicate that HIP1 is required for differentiation, proliferation, and/or survival of spermatogenic progenitors. The association of HIP1 with clathrin coats and the requirement of HIP1 for progenitor survival suggest a role for HIP1 in the regulation of endocytosis.","['Rao, D S', 'Chang, J C', 'Kumar, P D', 'Mizukami, I', 'Smithson, G M', 'Bradley, S V', 'Parlow, A F', 'Ross, T S']","['Rao DS', 'Chang JC', 'Kumar PD', 'Mizukami I', 'Smithson GM', 'Bradley SV', 'Parlow AF', 'Ross TS']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, 48109-0936, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA082363/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K08 CA76025-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA82363-01A1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (HIP1 protein, human)', '0 (HIP1R protein, human)', '0 (Hip1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Microfilament Proteins)', '0 (Vesicular Transport Proteins)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Clathrin-Coated Vesicles/*metabolism', 'DNA, Complementary', '*DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Gene Targeting/methods', 'Humans', 'Huntington Disease/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Microfilament Proteins', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Sequence Analysis, Protein', 'Spermatogenesis/*physiology', 'Spermatozoa/cytology', 'Stem Cells', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vesicular Transport Proteins']",2001/10/18 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/10/18 10:00'],"['2001/10/18 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/18 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/MCB.21.22.7796-7806.2001 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2001 Nov;21(22):7796-806. doi: 10.1128/MCB.21.22.7796-7806.2001.,,,,,PMC99949,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The different possible sources of HSCs (bone marrow, blood, and cord blood) and better knowledge of HLA typing has led to the development of new transplantation techniques and modalities (transplantations after non-myeloablative conditioning, haploidentical transplantations, etc.), which should improve patient survival and extend allograft indications. HSC allografting is subject to immunological reactions stemming from the histocompatibility discrepancy between donor and recipient. For the most part, these are reactions of the graft against the host (graft-versus-host disease: GVHD) and graft rejection (host-versus-graft: HVG). This immunological conflict can also be responsible for recognizing and destroying the recipient's residual tumor cells, which carry specific tumor antigens and/or minor antigens of histocompatibility (graft-versus-leukemia effect, GVL or graft-versus-malignancy effect, GVM). The posttransplantation period can also be riddled with various complications such as veno-occlusive disease, endocrine complications, as well as complications arising from infections and secondary neoplasms because of a more or less substantial and durable immune deficiency. Acute and chronic leukemias are the major indications for HSC allogeneic transplantation, for which the results are variable and closely related to the patient status, the hematological disease, and the transplant procedure. Other hematological diseases are also indications for allogeneic transplantation but are rarer, for which allogeneic transplantation remains nevertheless the only curative treatment, despite an overly high level of toxicity. Improvement in the results of unrelated transplantations, use of peripheral HSC or cord blood cells, development of non-myeloablative conditioning regimens, and techniques of ex vivo manipulation of the graft have allowed HSC allogeneic transplantation indications to be extended. The antitumor efficacy of donor lymphocytes infusion for relapses after transplantation mirrors the GVL effect and is the first stage in a targeted cellular immunotherapy using sensitized lymphocytes or dendritic cells.","['Michallet, M', 'Dhedin, N', 'Michallet, A S']","['Michallet M', 'Dhedin N', 'Michallet AS']","[""Service d'hematologie, Hopital edouard-Herriot, 5, place d'Arsonval, 69437 Lyon Cedex 3.""]",['fre'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",France,Bull Cancer,Bulletin du cancer,0072416,,IM,"['Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Graft Rejection', 'Graft vs Host Disease/immunology/physiopathology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/*methods', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Immunosuppression Therapy/methods', 'Infections/etiology', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Lymphoma/*therapy', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/etiology', 'Recurrence', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2001/10/18 10:00,2001/11/03 10:01,['2001/10/18 10:00'],"['2001/10/18 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/11/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/18 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Bull Cancer. 2001 Sep;88(9):908-26.,,162,,Allogreffes de cellules souches hematopoietiques dans le traitement des hemopathies malignes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Offspring from irradiated fathers had normal peripheral blood profiles, although the stem cell population was amplified in offspring arising from those exposed to (55)Fe at 84 days before conception. Exposure to MNU significantly increased the incidence of lympho-hemopoietic malignancies in offspring from the 84-day group, but not in those from the 18-day group.

FI0-c, and its sulfated derivative, FI0-c-S, on production of human proinflammatory cytokines, interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1 alpha) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha). METHODS: The herbal polysaccharides were modified by chlorosulfornic acid in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO). Cytokine production was measured by radioimmunoassay, mRNA for the cytokines was measured by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. RESULTS: FI0-c 4 mg/L itself induced IL-1 alpha production by THP-1 cells without stimulants, such as lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and phorbol myristate acetate (PMA). On the other hand, FI0-c and FI0-c-S inhibited the IL-1 alpha production by THP-1 cells with these stimulants. FI0-c and FI0-c-S significantly upregulated TNF alpha production by THP-1 cells without stimulants or at a low dose of LPS 10 mg/L and PMA 200 nmol/L, whereas these polysaccharides markedly downregulated the TNF alpha production by a high dose of LPS 100 mg/L and PMA. Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) responded to FI0-c and FI0-c-S in IL-1 alpha and TNF alpha production in a fashion similar to THP-1 cell responses.

METHODS: The polysaccharides were modified by formic acid. Cytokine production was quantitated by radioimmunoassay. mRNA for cytokines was measured by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. RESULTS: FI0-b and FI0-b-H 4, 40, and 400 mg/L significantly downregulated interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1 alpha) production by THP-1 cells induced by lypopolysaccharide (LPS) 1 or 10 mg/L and phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) 200 nmol/L. At lower stimulation with LPS 10 mg/L and PMA 200 nmol/L, both polysaccharides significantly upregulated tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) production by THP-1 cells. However, at higher stimulation with LPS 100 mg/L and PMA 200 nmol/L, they downregulated TNF alpha production. FI0-b-H downregulated interleukin-8 (IL-8) production by THP-1 cells at a lower-dose of LPS 1 mg/L and PMA 200 nmol/L, but upregulated IL-8 production at a higher-dose of LPS 10 mg/L and PMA 200 nmol/L. Production of cytokines (IL-1 alpha and TNF alpha) was transcriptionally or post-transcriptionally regulated by FI0-b and FI0-b-H.

By analysing the results of our own transplant program in patients with advanced lymphoma we tried to evaluate indications for allogeneic transplantations. METHODS: Data from lymphoma patients treated at the Klinikum Grosshadern between 1985 and 2001 were analysed retrospectively. RESULTS: 56 patients were included. 24 patients had low grade Non-Hogdkin's lymphoma (NHL) (follicular lymphoma: n = 8, mantle cell lymphoma: n = 6) or chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL: n = 10), 16 patients had high grade NHL (immunoblastic/lymphoblastic: n = 5; large cell/diffuse: n = 5) and 8 patients suffered from Hodgkins's disease. Median age was 41 years, 34 patients were transplanted from an HLA-identical sibling, 19 from an HLA-id. unrelated donor and three from an HLA-mismatched related donor. 30 patients received bone marrow and 26 peripheral blood stem cells. 22 pat. were treated with an intensive 12 Gy TBI containing conditioning regimen, whereas 34 patients were treated with a dose-intensity reduced conditioning procedere. 25 patients are alive between 2 month and 15 years after transplantation. Overall survival after 2 years is 48 % for patients with low grade NHL (incl. CLL), 9.3 % for patients with high grade lymphoma and 25 % for patients with Hodgkin's disease. 1-year-transplant-related mortality (TRM) was 33.9 % in all patients. Dose-intensity-reduced conditioning was not able to reduce TRM. CONCLUSIONS: Allogeneic bone marrow or stem cell transplantation is able to induce long lasting complete remissions in patients with heavily pretreated malignant lymphoma. Results of allogeneic transplantation are encouraging in patients with follicular and other low grade lymphoma. However transplant-related toxicity is high. At present the impact of reducing the intensity of conditioning is not yet clear.","['Stotzer, O J', 'Schleuning, M', 'Ledderose, G', 'Hiddemann, W', 'Kolb, H J']","['Stotzer OJ', 'Schleuning M', 'Ledderose G', 'Hiddemann W', 'Kolb HJ']","['Medizinische Klinik III der Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitat Munchen, Grosshadern.']",['ger'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Dtsch Med Wochenschr,Deutsche medizinische Wochenschrift (1946),0006723,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hodgkin Disease/mortality/therapy', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/mortality/therapy', 'Lymphoma/mortality/*therapy', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/mortality/therapy', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/mortality/therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/mortality/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",2001/10/17 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/10/17 10:00'],"['2001/10/17 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/17 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1055/s-2001-17492 [doi]'],ppublish,Dtsch Med Wochenschr. 2001 Sep 28;126(39):1062-9. doi: 10.1055/s-2001-17492.,,,,Allogene Transplantation maligner Lymphome.,,['Dtsch Med Wochenschr. 2001 Sep 28;126(39):1061.

The Fv-4 gene encodes an envelope (Env) protein whose putative receptor-binding domain resembles that of ecotropic MuLV Env protein. Resistance to ecotropic MuLVs appears to result from viral interference involving binding of the endogenously expressed Fv-4 env-encoded protein to the ecotropic receptor, although the immune system also plays a role in resistance. The Fv-4 env-encoded protein is processed normally and can be incorporated into virus particles but is unable to promote viral entry. Among the many sequence variations between the transmembrane (TM) subunit of the Fv-4 env-encoded protein and the TM subunits of other MuLV Env proteins, there is a substitution of an arginine residue in the Fv-4 env-encoded protein for a glycine residue (gly-491 in Moloney MuLV Env) that is otherwise conserved in all of the other MuLVs. This residue is present in the MuLV TM fusion peptide sequence. In this study, gly-491 of Moloney MuLV Env has been replaced with other residues and a mutant Env bearing a substitution for gly-487 was also created. G491R recapitulates the Fv-4 Env phenotype in cell culture, indicating that this substitution is sufficient for creation of an Env protein that can establish the interference-mediated resistance to ecotropic viruses produced by the Fv-4 gene. Analysis of the mutant MuLV Env proteins also has implications for an understanding of the role of conserved glycine residues in fusion peptides and for the engineering of organismal resistance to retroviruses.","['Taylor, G M', 'Gao, Y', 'Sanders, D A']","['Taylor GM', 'Gao Y', 'Sanders DA']","['Department of Biological Sciences, Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana 47907-1392, USA.']",['eng'],"['T32 GM008296/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'GM08296/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Fv4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*immunology', 'Membrane Fusion', 'Membrane Proteins/*chemistry/genetics/physiology', 'Molecular Sequence Data']",2001/10/17 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/10/17 10:00'],"['2001/10/17 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/17 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.75.22.11244-11248.2001 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2001 Nov;75(22):11244-8. doi: 10.1128/JVI.75.22.11244-11248.2001.,,,,,PMC114706,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tax is also the immunodominant target antigen for cytotoxic T cells in HTLV-1 infection. We found that Tax bound to assembled nuclear proteasomes, but Tax could not be detected in the cytoplasm. Confocal microscopy revealed a partial colocalization of Tax with nuclear proteasomes. As Tax translocated into the nucleus very quickly after synthesis, this process probably takes place prior to and independent of proteasome association. Tax mutants revealed that both the Tax N and C termini play a role in proteasome binding. We also found that proteasomes from Tax-transfected cells had enhanced proteolytic activity on prototypic peptide substrates. This effect was not due to the induction of the LMP2 and LMP7 proteasome subunits. Furthermore, Tax appeared to be a long-lived protein, with a half-life of around 15 h.

The best-known properties of IE1 at present are its transient targeting to punctate promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML)-associated nuclear bodies (PML oncogenic domains [PODs] or nuclear domain 10 [ND10]), with associated displacement of the cellular PML tumor suppressor protein into a diffuse nucleoplasmic form and its association with metaphase chromosomes. Recent studies have shown that the targeting of PML (and associated proteins such as hDaxx) to PODs is dependent on modification of PML by ubiquitin-like protein SUMO-1. In this study, we provide direct evidence that IE1 is also covalently modified by SUMO-1 in both infected and cotransfected cells, as well as in in vitro assays, with up to 30% of the protein representing the covalently conjugated 90-kDa form in stable U373/IE1 cell lines. Lysine 450 was mapped as the major SUMO-1 conjugation site, but a point mutation of this lysine residue in IE1 did not interfere with its targeting to and disruption of the PODs. Surprisingly, unlike PML or IE2, IE1 did not interact with either Ubc9 or SUMO-1 in yeast two-hybrid assays, suggesting that some additional unknown intranuclear cofactors must play a role in IE1 sumoylation. Interestingly, stable expression of either exogenous PML or exogenous Flag-SUMO-1 in U373 cell lines greatly enhanced both the levels and rate of in vivo IE1 sumoylation during HCMV infection. Unlike the disruption of PODs by the herpes simplex virus type 1 IE110(ICP0) protein, the disruption of PODs by HCMV IE1 proved not to involve proteasome-dependent degradation of PML. We also demonstrate here that the 560-amino-acid PML1 isoform functions as a transcriptional repressor when fused to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain and that wild-type IE1 inhibits the repressor function of PML1 in transient cotransfection assays. Furthermore, both IE1(1-346) and IE1(L174P) mutants, which are defective in displacing PML from PODs, failed to inhibit the repression activity of PML1, whereas the sumoylation-negative IE1(K450R) mutant derepressed as efficiently as wild-type IE1. Taken together, our results suggest that proteasome-independent disruption of PODs, but not IE1 sumoylation, is required for efficient IE1 inhibition of PML-mediated transcriptional repression.","['Xu, Y', 'Ahn, J H', 'Cheng, M', 'apRhys, C M', 'Chiou, C J', 'Zong, J', 'Matunis, M J', 'Hayward, G S']","['Xu Y', 'Ahn JH', 'Cheng M', 'apRhys CM', 'Chiou CJ', 'Zong J', 'Matunis MJ', 'Hayward GS']","['Molecular Virology Laboratories, Department of Pharmacology and Molecular Sciences, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland 21231, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 AI024576/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM060980/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI24576/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (IE1 protein, cytomegalovirus)', '0 (Immediate-Early Proteins)', '0 (Multienzyme Complexes)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Pml protein, mouse)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (SUMO-1 Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Immediate-Early Proteins/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Multienzyme Complexes/*physiology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*chemistry/physiology', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex', 'Repressor Proteins/*physiology', 'SUMO-1 Protein/*physiology', 'Transcription Factors/antagonists & inhibitors/*chemistry/physiology', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Two-Hybrid System Techniques', '*Viral Proteins']",2001/10/17 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/10/17 10:00'],"['2001/10/17 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/17 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.75.22.10683-10695.2001 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2001 Nov;75(22):10683-95. doi: 10.1128/JVI.75.22.10683-10695.2001.,,,,,PMC114650,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Subgroup A FeLV (FeLV-A) is the virus that is transmitted from cat to cat, suggesting that cells expressing the FeLV-A receptor are important targets at the earliest stages of infection. FeLV-B evolves from FeLV-A in the infected cat through acquisition of cellular sequences that are related to the FeLV envelope gene. FeLV-Bs have been shown to infect cells using the Pit1 receptor, and some variants can infect cells at a lower efficiency using Pit2. Because these observations were made using receptor proteins of human or rodent origin, the role that Pit1 and Pit2 may play in FeLV-B replication in the cat is unclear. In this study, the feline Pit receptors were cloned and tested for their ability to act as receptors for different FeLV-Bs. Some FeLV-Bs infected cells expressing feline Pit2 and feline Pit1 with equal high efficiency. Variable region A (VRA) in the putative receptor-binding domain (RBD) was a critical determinant for both feline Pit1 and feline Pit2 binding, although other domains in the RBD appear to influence how efficiently the FeLV-B surface unit can bind to feline Pit2 and promote entry via this receptor. An arginine residue at position 73 in VRA was found to be important for envelope binding to feline Pit2 but not feline Pit1. Interestingly, this arginine is not found in endogenous FeLV sequences or in recombinant viruses recovered from feline cells infected with FeLV-A. Thus, while FeLV-Bs that are able to use feline Pit2 can evolve by recombination with endogenous sequences, a subsequent point mutation during reverse transcription may be needed to generate a virus that can efficiently enter the cells using the feline Pit2 as its receptor. These studies suggest that cells expressing the feline Pit2 protein are likely to be targets for FeLV-B infection in the cat.","['Anderson, M M', 'Lauring, A S', 'Robertson, S', 'Dirks, C', 'Overbaugh, J']","['Anderson MM', 'Lauring AS', 'Robertson S', 'Dirks C', 'Overbaugh J']","['Division of Human Biology, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, University of Washington, Seattle, 98109-1024, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA051080/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA009229/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '2T32 CA09229/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA51080/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (feline leukemia virus receptor)', '0 (leukemia virus receptor, gibbon ape)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Biological Evolution', 'Cats', 'Cell Line', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/*classification', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Receptors, Virus/chemistry/*physiology']",2001/10/17 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/10/17 10:00'],"['2001/10/17 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/17 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.75.22.10563-10572.2001 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2001 Nov;75(22):10563-72. doi: 10.1128/JVI.75.22.10563-10572.2001.,,,,,PMC114638,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After ligand binding and activation of the Janus protein-tyrosine kinase/STAT and mitogen-activated protein kinase signal transduction pathways, negative feedback processes are recruited. These processes attenuate receptor action by suppression of cytokine signaling and by down-regulation of receptor protein expression. This study demonstrates that in human fibroblasts or epithelial cells, OSM first decreases the level of gp130, LIFRalpha, and OSMRbeta by ligand-induced receptor degradation and then increases the level of the receptors by enhanced synthesis. The transcriptional induction of gp130 gene by OSM involves STAT3. Various cell lines expressing receptor subunits to the different interleukin-6 class cytokines revealed that only LIFRalpha degradation is promoted by activated ERK and that degradation of gp130, OSMRbeta, and a fraction of LIFRalpha involves mechanisms that are separate from signal transduction. These mechanisms include ligand-mediated dimerization, internalization, and endosomal/lysosomal degradation. Proteosomal degradation appears to involve a fraction of receptor subunit proteins that are ubiquitinated independently of ligand binding.","['Blanchard, F', 'Wang, Y', 'Kinzie, E', 'Duplomb, L', 'Godard, A', 'Baumann, H']","['Blanchard F', 'Wang Y', 'Kinzie E', 'Duplomb L', 'Godard A', 'Baumann H']","['Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, New York 14263, USA.']",['eng'],"['CA 16056/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 85580/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK 38866/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Il6st protein, mouse)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Osm protein, mouse)', '0 (Protein Synthesis Inhibitors)', '106956-32-5 (Oncostatin M)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130', 'Endosomes/metabolism', 'Fibroblasts/metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*metabolism', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Oncostatin M/*metabolism', 'Protein Synthesis Inhibitors/pharmacology']",2001/10/17 10:00,2002/01/25 10:01,['2001/10/17 10:00'],"['2001/10/17 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/25 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/17 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M107971200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)37231-X [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2001 Dec 14;276(50):47038-45. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M107971200.

DESIGN AND METHODS: We collected clinical information and resource utilization from 131 consecutive autologous transplantations (102 peripheral blood progenitor cell (PBPC) and 29 bone marrow (BM) transplants) at a single institution between January 1989 and December 1998 in children with a variety of malignancies. Multivariable linear regression was used to evaluate the associations between pre-transplantation variables, post-infusion events and overall costs. A cost-effectiveness analysis of transplantation for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) patients was also performed. RESULTS: Hematopoietic recovery was faster in the PBPCT group (days to neutrophil and platelet engraftment: 9 and 13, respectively, versus 14 and 21 for BMT, p<0.0001). There were less transfusion, antibiotic and parenteral nutrition requirements and hospital stay was shorter (median 17 days; range 8-38) in the PBPCT group than in the BMT one (median 28 days; range 11-65) (p<0.0001) resulting in a median lower overall cost for PBPCT (US$ 7895) compared to BMT (US$ 11820)(p<0.0001). Major determinants of overall costs for both groups were total body irradiation (TBI)-based conditioning regimen, days of hospitalization and number of transfused platelets. In PBPCT patients, a graft containing > or = 5 x 10(6)/kg CD34+ cells decreased the total cost of transplantation by 27%. Cost-effectiveness was higher for PBPCT than BMT for pediatric AML patients (p<0.0001) whereas in ALL patients the cost-effectiveness of the two transplant strategies was not significantly different.

Based on these premises we evaluated the efficacy and the toxicity of chimeric anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (MoAb) in relapsed/progressed hairy cell leukemia (HCL). DESIGN AND METHODS: Ten patients with relapsed/progressed HCL entered the study. Eight patients were males and two females with a median age of 55 years (range 41-78) and all of them had been previously treated with 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine and/or deoxycoformycin and a-interferon. Two out of 10 patients were anemic (Hb < 10 g/dL), 4 thrombocytopenic (Plt < 100 x 10(9)/L), 3 had fewer than 1.0 x 10(9)/L neutrophils and 3 had circulating hairy cells (HC). All patients received 375 mg/m2 i.v. of anti-CD20 MoAb once a week for 4 doses. RESULTS: All patients were evaluable for response, one patient showing a complete remission and 4 a partial response. Adverse reactions, such as fever, chills, bone pain, hypotension and thrombocytopenia, were transient and mild (grade 1-2) and occurred only during the first course of treatment. One month after the last infusion, patients who had had anemia, neutropenia or thrombocytopenia, recovered normal peripheral blood values. Circulating HC also disappeared within one month. Immunostained bone marrow biopsies were checked 1, 3 and 6 months after the end of therapy and in 5 out of 10 patients a >50% reduction of bone marrow HC infiltration was recorded. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of these preliminary results observed in 10 patients with progressed HCL, it appears that treatment with anti-CD20 MoAb is safe and effective in at least 50% of patients, particularly in those with a less evident bone marrow infiltration (50%) and in those previously splenectomized.","['Lauria, F', 'Lenoci, M', 'Annino, L', 'Raspadori, D', 'Marotta, G', 'Bocchia, M', 'Forconi, F', 'Gentili, S', 'La Manda, M', 'Marconcini, S', 'Tozzi, M', 'Baldini, L', 'Zinzani, P L', 'Foa, R']","['Lauria F', 'Lenoci M', 'Annino L', 'Raspadori D', 'Marotta G', 'Bocchia M', 'Forconi F', 'Gentili S', 'La Manda M', 'Marconcini S', 'Tozzi M', 'Baldini L', 'Zinzani PL', 'Foa R']","['Department of Hematology ""A.

Conversely, acute leukemias express WT1 at a high frequency, and leukemias with high levels of WT1 expressed by leukemic blast cells have a significantly worse prognosis, suggesting an oncogenic function of WT1 in leukemic cells. To address this issue, we developed five hammerhead ribozymes (RZ1-RZ5) designed to cleave various wt1-mRNA GUC-recognition sites and thus suppress wt1 expression. METHODS: Using in vitro transcribed ribozymes and truncated wt1 target RNAs as substrates, we performed in vitro cleavage assays. The sequence of two ribozymes was then cloned into the pCDNA3 expression vector containing a self-processing ribozyme cassette. Downregulation of wt1 due to ribozyme expression was analyzed in the human 293 embryonic kidney and the K562 chronic myeloid leukemia cell line by Western blotting and RT-PCR. Growth of stable transfected K562 cells was determined by proliferation analysis and 3H-thymidine incorporation. RESULTS: In vitro, the anti-wt1 ribozymes were able to recognize and cleave the target RNA in a highly sequence-specific and time-dependent manner. The ribozymes showed different catalytic activity. Coexpression of wt1 and the self-processing ribozymes pRZ3 and pRZ5, respectively, resulted in a significantly downregulated WT1 protein level when transiently transfected in 293 cells. Furthermore, stable transfection of pRZ3 and pRZ5 resulted in considerably reduced expression of endogenous wt1 in K562 cells, correlating with the inhibition of cell proliferation and the induction of cell death. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that anti-wt1 ribozymes are a potent inhibitor of wt1 expression with possible implications for the inhibition of cell proliferation in leukemic cells.","['Hubinger, G', 'Schmid, M', 'Linortner, S', 'Manegold, A', 'Bergmann, L', 'Maurer, U']","['Hubinger G', 'Schmid M', 'Linortner S', 'Manegold A', 'Bergmann L', 'Maurer U']","['Department of Internal Medicine III, University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany. gabi.huebinger@medizin.uni-ulm.de']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (RNA, Catalytic)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Catalytic Domain', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Cell-Free System', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA Primers', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Kinetics', 'Models, Genetic', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA, Catalytic/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/*genetics', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Suppression, Genetic', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'WT1 Proteins/*genetics']",2001/10/17 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/10/17 10:00'],"['2001/10/17 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/17 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-472X(01)00719-6 [pii]', '10.1016/s0301-472x(01)00719-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2001 Oct;29(10):1226-35. doi: 10.1016/s0301-472x(01)00719-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Upon follow-up of recipient mice, the lymphomas showed characteristics similar to chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) with Ritcher's transformation. RESULTS: Blood samples from the recipient mice showed that CLL-RT cells increased rapidly in peripheral blood after 5 weeks. Serum interleukin-10 also increased significantly in recipient mice, as in human chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients. These CLL-RT cells showed a high nucleus-to-cytoplasm ratio. These cells could metastasize via circulation in the recipients and form diffuse lymphomas in various tissues. These aggressive and diffuse lymphomas were similar to Ritcher's transformation of human CLL. The cell surface antigens of the spleen and peritoneal resident cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. The CLL-RT cells constantly expressed surface immunoglobulins M and G, and CD5, CD19, B220, and CD40 molecules. They did not express any CD11b, CD3, MAC-3, CD23, NK1.1, or H-2K(d) molecules. CONCLUSIONS: The characteristics of our animal model are very similar to human CLL. This animal system could be an ideal model for the human disease. We believe the animal model would be valuable in therapeutic studies and aid in the identification of the specific genetic alleles associated with the disease.","['Su, Y C', 'Wu, W M', 'Wu, M F', 'Chiang, B L']","['Su YC', 'Wu WM', 'Wu MF', 'Chiang BL']","['Laboratory Animal Center, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Republic of China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,['130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)'],IM,"['Animals', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Interleukin-10/analysis', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/immunology/pathology/*physiopathology', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Lymphocytes/immunology/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasm Transplantation']",2001/10/17 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/10/17 10:00'],"['2001/10/17 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/17 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-472X(01)00690-7 [pii]', '10.1016/s0301-472x(01)00690-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2001 Oct;29(10):1218-25. doi: 10.1016/s0301-472x(01)00690-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: In the present study a system was developed in which genetic reshuffling during the retroviral life cycle is exploited, allowing reconstitution of functional expression cassettes from separate elements exclusively in transduced target cells. For construction of these murine leukaemia virus (MLV)-based reconstituting viral vectors (ReCon), a promoterless inverted enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) reporter gene cassette was inserted in place of the U3 region of the 3' LTR. Subsequently, the human ubiquitin promoter was inserted in the inverse orientation into the R/U5 border of the 5' LTR of the vector. RESULTS: PA317 packaging cells stably transfected with ReCon vectors were established and EGFP expression was analysed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). After detection of low-level background expression, an additional polyadenylation signal was introduced in antisense orientation into the 3' LTR at the R/U5 border to prevent accidental read-through transcription from neighbouring cellular promoters. Virus-containing cell culture supernatants were then used to infect NIH3T3 target cells. EGFP expression, recloning and sequencing of integrated proviruses demonstrated the correct reassembly of the transduced ubiquitin/EGFP transcription unit in these infected cells. CONCLUSIONS: This facile and convenient system should allow production of retroviral vectors encoding potentially toxic proteins, cell cycle inhibitors or inducers of apoptosis, all of which would interfere with vector production if expressed in the retroviral packaging cell.","['Tabotta, W', 'Klein, D', 'Hohenadl, C', 'Salmons, B', 'Gunzburg, W H']","['Tabotta W', 'Klein D', 'Hohenadl C', 'Salmons B', 'Gunzburg WH']","['Institute of Virology, University of Veterinary Sciences, Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,J Gene Med,The journal of gene medicine,9815764,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'DNA Primers/chemistry', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation', '*Genetic Vectors', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'Luminescent Proteins/genetics', 'Mice', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Terminal Repeat Sequences/genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic/genetics', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Transgenes/physiology']",2001/10/17 10:00,2002/02/22 10:01,['2001/10/17 10:00'],"['2001/10/17 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/02/22 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/17 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jgm.209 [doi]'],ppublish,J Gene Med. 2001 Sep-Oct;3(5):418-26. doi: 10.1002/jgm.209.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Phase II, multicenter, open-label, nonrandomized, parallel study SETTING: Hospitals and outpatient oncology clinics. PATIENTS: Fifty-eight patients with acute myeloid leukemia in first relapse participated. Demographic data included 29 men and 29 women; 34 were younger than 60 years of age (mean age 53+/-16 yrs). INTERVENTION: Patients received gemtuzumab ozogamicin as a single 2-hour infusion of 9 mg/m2. Serial plasma samples were collected over 10 days after the beginning of the infusion. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Plasma concentrations of components of gemtuzumab ozogamicin (hP67.6 antibody, total and unconjugated calicheamicin derivatives) were measured by validated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Pharmacokinetic parameters were determined by noncompartmental methods and comparisons between groups were made by analysis of variance. No significant differences were seen between men and women or between those over 60 and those less than 60 years of age in maximum concentration, time to maximum concentration, area under the curve, clearance, or volume of distribution for components of gemtuzumab ozogamicin.

METHODS: K562 and HL-60 cells were cultured in presence of WT1 oligomers. Both cell lines express WT1 gene with no p53 protein expression. Cells growth, apoptosis and expression of WT1, bcl-2 genes were analysed using 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenylmetrazolium bromide (MTT) colorimetric assay, flow cytometry and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) methods. RESULTS: WT1 antisense oligonucleotides inhibited cellular proliferation of K562 cells and the effect was concentration-dependent. When cultured at concentration of 200 micrograms/ml oligomers, growth inhibition was 46.2% for antisense oligonucleotide cultivated group and 28.1% for sense oligonucleotide cultured group (P = 0.008) respectively. WT1 antisense oligonucleotide can induce apoptosis of K562 and HL-60 cells. Percentages of apoptotic cells in antisense oligonucleotide and sense oligonucleotide treated groups were 30.88% versus 13.62% for K562 cells and 40.15% versus 4.23% for HL-60 cells. However the growth of HL-60 cells and expression of bcl-2 gene were unaffected. CONCLUSIONS: The WT1 gene is related with proliferation and apoptosis of leukemic cells. Effect of anti-apoptosis may be independent of the cellular p53 status and bcl-2 expression. WT1 gene may play an important role in leukemogenesis.","['Mi, Y', 'Wang, L', 'Bian, S', 'Meng, Q', 'Chen, G', 'Wang, J']","['Mi Y', 'Wang L', 'Bian S', 'Meng Q', 'Chen G', 'Wang J']","['Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, CAMS, PUMC, Tianjin 300020, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Chin Med J (Engl),Chinese medical journal,7513795,"['0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Cell Division', 'Gene Expression', '*Genes, Wilms Tumor', 'Genes, bcl-2', 'Genes, p53', 'HL-60 Cells/pathology', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells/pathology', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense', 'WT1 Proteins/*biosynthesis']",2001/10/17 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/10/17 10:00'],"['2001/10/17 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/17 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Chin Med J (Engl). 1999 Aug;112(8):705-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: There were 2720 pediatric patients with 2750 cancers who were studied. Forty-four types of cancer were grouped into 11 diagnostic categories. Diagnosis years spanned four eras: 1944-1953, 1954-1963, 1964-1973, and 1974-1983. Cases were compared using specific characteristics and were divided into short-term and long-term survivors with the division generously set at seven years. The proportions of the long-term survivors were compared by specific characteristics. RESULTS: Among the diagnostic categories, leukemias were the most common (29.8%), followed by CNS tumors (15.2%), and Hodgkin's disease (9.0%). Male to female ratio was 4:3; average age at diagnosis was 8.83 +/- 6.08 years. Long-term survivors totaled 1148 (41.7%). Prognosis was better in cases diagnosed in earlier stages and in later eras. Proportion of long-term survivors increased from 18.7% in era I to 52.6% in era IV. Improvement of survival was statistically significant in most diagnostic categories. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows continuing improvement of survival during four consecutive eras for childhood and adolescent cancer. Early diagnosis was associated with better survival. Unstaged cases decreased over time reflecting progress in diagnostic techniques. Many patients died before seven years after diagnosis. Those who survived more than seven years had excellent survival.

METHODS: C-mpl expression was detected in 43 AL patients by using semi-quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and the effect of rhTpo on acute leukemia cells by MTT assay. RESULTS: C-mpl was expressed in 22 of 35 patients with acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML), but did not in 8 patients with ALL. The percentage of C-mpl expression (16/22, 72.7%) was significantly higher in CD34 positive AML patients than in CD34 negative group (4/12, 33.3%, P = 0.031), and was higher in patients with M2b, M3 and M4EO than in those with other AML subtypes (40.0% vs 80.0%, P = 0.019). The complete remission rate in C-mpl positive AML patients was lower than that in negative patients (70.0% vs 81.8%, P = 0.394), although the difference was not significant.

METHOD: Immunophenotypes were examined using indirect immunofluorescence method in 102 de novo ALL. RESULTS: The incidence of myeloid antigen expression in adult ALL was 21.6% and the commonest one was CD33 (15.7%). There was a higher incidence of myeloid antigens expression in ALL-L2 than in ALL-L1 (25.6% vs 5.3%, P = 0.05). CD34 was expressed in lymphoblasts from 30 of 56 patients (53.6%).

Emerging data suggest an involvement of angiogenesis in the pathophysiology of hematologic malignancies as well. Recently, we and others have reported increased angiogenesis in the bone marrow of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and normalization of bone marrow microvessel density when patients achieved a complete remission (CR) after induction chemotherapy. Tumor angiogenesis depends on the expression of specific mediators that initiate a cascade of events leading to the formation of new microvessels. Among these, VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor), FGF (fibroblast growth factor) and angiopoietins play a pivotal role in the induction of neovascularization in solid tumors. These cytokines stimulate migration and proliferation of endothelial cells and induce angiogenesis in vivo. Recent data suggest an important role for these mediators in hematologic malignancies as well. Isolated AML blasts overexpress VEGF and VEGF receptor 2. Thus, the VEGF/VEGFR-2 pathway can promote the growth of leukemic blasts in an autocrine and paracrine manner. Therefore, neovascularization and angiogenic mediators/receptors may be promising targets for anti-angiogenic and anti-leukemic treatment strategies. The immunomodulatory drug thalidomide inhibits angiogenesis in animal models. Moreover, it has significant activity in refractory multiple myeloma. In a current phase II study for patients with primary refractory or relapsed multiple myeloma using a combination of thalidomide with hyperfractionated cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone (Hyper-CDT), we observed a partial remission in 12 of 14 evaluable patients (86%). Thus, this combination seems to be very potent. Furthermore, we evaluated the safety and efficacy of thalidomide in patients with AML not qualifying for intensive cytotoxic chemotherapy. 20 patients aged 58-85 (median 69) years were recruited to this phase I/II study and were treated with a dose of 200-400 mg per os daily for a duration of 1-40 (median 6) weeks, dependent on the individual tolerability of the drug. In 4 patients we observed a partial response (PR - defined as more than 50% reduction in leukemic blast infiltration in the bone marrow). This was accompanied by an increase in platelet counts and hemoglobin values. One additional patient showed a significant improvement of peripheral blood counts without fulfilling the criteria of a PR. In parallel, we observed a significant decrease in microvessel density in these 5 patients during treatment with thalidomide. In conclusion, thalidomide seems to have anti-angiogenic as well as anti-leukemic activity in AML. The VEGF/VEGFR-2 pathway seems to play an important role in AML. Therefore, receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors like SU5416 or SU6668 are currently evaluated in the context of phase II studies in AML. We could recently induce a stable remission in a patient with second relapse of her AML refractory towards chemotherapy by administration of SU5416 (compassionate use), a tyrosine kinase inhibitor of VEGFR-2 and ckit. Current and future studies will clarify the role of anti-angiogenic treatment strategies in AML and other hematologic malignancies.","['Mesters, R M', 'Padro, T', 'Steins, M', 'Bieker, R', 'Retzlaff, S', 'Kessler, T', 'Kienast, J', 'Berdel, W E']","['Mesters RM', 'Padro T', 'Steins M', 'Bieker R', 'Retzlaff S', 'Kessler T', 'Kienast J', 'Berdel WE']","['Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik A, Universitatsklinikum Munster, Germany. mesters@uni-muenster.de']",['ger'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Switzerland,Onkologie,Onkologie,7808556,['4Z8R6ORS6L (Thalidomide)'],IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Bone Marrow/*blood supply/drug effects', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Microcirculation/drug effects/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Thalidomide/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome']",2001/10/16 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/10/16 10:00'],"['2001/10/16 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/16 10:00 [entrez]']","['55192 [pii]', '10.1159/000055192 [doi]']",ppublish,Onkologie. 2001 Sep;24 Suppl 5:75-80. doi: 10.1159/000055192.,"['Copyright 2001 S.

Their spectrum and association with specific malignancies offer multiple targets for therapeutic intervention. Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) represents an ideal target for a therapy using a selective inhibitor of the BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase. The 2-phenylpyrimidine derivative STI571 was rationally designed to inhibit ABL and BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase activities through competitive ATP-binding pocket interactions. Phase II data demonstrate hematologic and cytogenetic responses in interferon refractory chronic-phase, accelerated-phase and blast crisis patients. However, long-term observation is needed to confirm that response data result in prolongation of survival. STI571 is being studied in other malignancies, including leukemias characterized by expression of alternate molecular forms of BCR-ABL and those expressing protein tyrosine kinases with ATP-binding pockets structurally similar to ABL, e.g. c-kit and PDGF-R. Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) cells overexpress the stem cell factor receptor CD117, the product of the proto-oncogene c-kit. Inhibition of c-kit in vivo results in an immediate metabolic change of the tumor cells, detectable by positron emission tomography. Since c-kit overexpression is inhibited in small-cell lung cancer cell lines, a study with STI571 as second-line therapy of c-kit-positive small-cell lung cancer is in progress. Clinical studies are ongoing in malignancies associated with an enhanced activity of the PDGF-R, such as highgrade glioma, prostate cancer and leukemias with rearrangements of PDGF-R. The development of selective tyrosine kinase inhibitors is considered a promising approach for the design of new drugs. Clinical responses to STI571 in various malignancies may stimulate greater interest in the clinical use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors.","['Hochhaus, A', 'Lahaye, T', 'Kreil, S', 'Berger, U', 'Metzgeroth, G', 'Hehlmann, R']","['Hochhaus A', 'Lahaye T', 'Kreil S', 'Berger U', 'Metzgeroth G', 'Hehlmann R']","['III.

METHODS: A case-control study, comprising 255 Ph+CML patients from southern Sweden and matched controls, was conducted. Individual data on work tasks, hobbies, and lifestyle exposures were obtained by telephone interviews. Occupational hygienists assessed occupational and hobby exposures for each subject individually. Also, occupational titles were obtained from national registries, and group level exposure-that is, the exposure proportion for each occupational title-was assessed with a job exposure matrix. The effects of 11 exposures using individual data and two exposures using group data (organic solvents and animal dust) were estimated. RESULTS: For the individual data on organic solvents, an effect was found for moderate or high intensity of exposure (odds ratio (OR) 3.4, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.1 to 11) and for long duration (15-20 years) of exposure (OR 2.1, 95% CI 1.1 to 4.0). By contrast, the group data showed no association (OR 0.69, 95% CI 0.27 to 1.8; moderate or high intensity versus no exposure). For extremely low frequency electromagnetic fields (EMFs), only individual data were available. An association with long occupational exposure to EMFs was found (OR 2.3, 95% CI 1.2 to 4.5). However, no effect of EMF intensity was indicated. No significant effects of benzene, gasoline or diesel, or tobacco smoking were found. OR estimates below unity were suggested for personal use of hair dye and for agricultural exposures. CONCLUSIONS: Associations between exposure to organic solvents and EMFs, and Ph+CML were indicated but were not entirely consistent.","['Bjork, J', 'Albin, M', 'Welinder, H', 'Tinnerberg, H', 'Mauritzson, N', 'Kauppinen, T', 'Stromberg, U', 'Johansson, B', 'Billstrom, R', 'Mikoczy, Z', 'Ahlgren, T', 'Nilsson, P G', 'Mitelman, F', 'Hagmar, L']","['Bjork J', 'Albin M', 'Welinder H', 'Tinnerberg H', 'Mauritzson N', 'Kauppinen T', 'Stromberg U', 'Johansson B', 'Billstrom R', 'Mikoczy Z', 'Ahlgren T', 'Nilsson PG', 'Mitelman F', 'Hagmar L']","['Department of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, Lund University Hospital, SE-221 85 Lund, Sweden. jonas.bjork@ymed.lu.se']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Occup Environ Med,Occupational and environmental medicine,9422759,['0 (Solvents)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Electromagnetic Fields/adverse effects', 'Female', '*Hobbies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*etiology', '*Life Style', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Occupational Diseases/*etiology', 'Occupational Exposure', 'Risk Factors', 'Solvents/adverse effects']",2001/10/16 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/10/16 10:00'],"['2001/10/16 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/16 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/oem.58.11.722 [doi]'],ppublish,Occup Environ Med. 2001 Nov;58(11):722-7. doi: 10.1136/oem.58.11.722.,,,,,PMC1740065,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed the risk of developing EMD localization at relapse in APL patients enrolled onto two consecutive studies of the Gruppo Italiano Malattie Ematologiche dell'Adulto. The studies investigated chemotherapy alone (LAP0389) versus RA plus chemotherapy (AIDA). RESULTS: When all relapse types were taken into account, 94 (51%) of 184 patients and 131 (18%) of 740 patients who attained hematologic remission underwent relapse in the LAP0389 and AIDA studies, respectively (P < .0001). EMD localization was documented in five (5%) of 94 and 16 (12%) of 131 patients (P = .08). Hematologic and/or molecular relapse was diagnosed concomitantly in all but two patients with EMD in the AIDA study. For patients in the LAP0389 and AIDA series, the probability of EMD localization of any type at relapse was 3% and 4.5%, respectively (P = .79), while the probability of CNS involvement was 0.6% and 2% (P = .28). No significant differences were found with regard to mean WBC count and promyelocytic leukemia/retinoic acid receptor-alpha junction type in comparisons of patients with EMD and hematologic relapse. CONCLUSION: APL patients receiving all-trans retinoic acid in addition to chemotherapy have no increased risk of developing EMD at relapse as compared with those treated with chemotherapy alone.","['Specchia, G', 'Lo Coco, F', 'Vignetti, M', 'Avvisati, G', 'Fazi, P', 'Albano, F', 'Di Raimondo, F', 'Martino, B', 'Ferrara, F', 'Selleri, C', 'Liso, V', 'Mandelli, F']","['Specchia G', 'Lo Coco F', 'Vignetti M', 'Avvisati G', 'Fazi P', 'Albano F', 'Di Raimondo F', 'Martino B', 'Ferrara F', 'Selleri C', 'Liso V', 'Mandelli F']","['Department of Hematology, University of Bari, Bari, Italy. emadhba@cimedoc.uniba.it']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (RARA protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Hematopoiesis, Extramedullary', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/cerebrospinal fluid/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'RNA/analysis', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/analysis/genetics', 'Recurrence', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Risk Factors', 'Tretinoin/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use']",2001/10/16 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/10/16 10:00'],"['2001/10/16 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/16 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.2001.19.20.4023 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2001 Oct 15;19(20):4023-8. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2001.19.20.4023.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Seventy-five adults with either SNC or L3 ALL (median age, 44 years) were treated with an aggressive regimen that consisted of one cycle of cyclophosphamide and prednisone followed by cycles containing either ifosfamide or cyclophosphamide; high-dose methotrexate, vincristine, dexamethasone, and either doxorubicin or etoposide/cytarabine; or intrathecal triple therapy with prophylactic CNS irradiation. RESULTS: All 24 patients with L3 ALL and the 30 of 51 patients with SNC confirmed by central histologic review were included in this analysis. Forty-three of 54 patients achieved complete response (CR) (18 of 24 with ALL and 25 of 30 with SNC), and 28 are alive and in continuous CR with a median follow-up of 5.1 years. Hematologic toxicity was profound, and nonhematologic toxicity was notable, with 10 of 75 patients treated developing significant neurologic toxicity consisting of transverse myelitis in five patients, CNS toxicity in three, and severe peripheral neuropathy in two. All patients who did not achieve CR died of the disease, and all recurrences occurred within 16 months of the end of treatment. Responses and toxicities were similar in the patients with both lymphoma and leukemia. CONCLUSION: Aggressively delivered chemotherapy is potentially curative in as many as half of patients with SNC and the L3 ALL variant. This treatment regimen had considerable neurologic toxicity and has been modified.","['Lee, E J', 'Petroni, G R', 'Schiffer, C A', 'Freter, C E', 'Johnson, J L', 'Barcos, M', 'Frizzera, G', 'Bloomfield, C D', 'Peterson, B A']","['Lee EJ', 'Petroni GR', 'Schiffer CA', 'Freter CE', 'Johnson JL', 'Barcos M', 'Frizzera G', 'Bloomfield CD', 'Peterson BA']","['Department of Medicine, the Alvin and Lois Lapidus Cancer Institute, Sinai Hospital, Baltimore, MD, USA.']",['eng'],['CA31946/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'UM20QQM95Y (Ifosfamide)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Central Nervous System', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Ifosfamide/therapeutic use', 'Infections/chemically induced', 'Injections, Spinal', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*drug therapy/pathology/radiotherapy', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Neutropenia/chemically induced', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/pathology/radiotherapy', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage', 'Survival Analysis', 'Thrombocytopenia/chemically induced', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",2001/10/16 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/10/16 10:00'],"['2001/10/16 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/16 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.2001.19.20.4014 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2001 Oct 15;19(20):4014-22. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2001.19.20.4014.,,16,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Studies with intestinal epithelial cells have suggested that this activity is mediated by the reduced folate carrier (RFC1). In this paper, we report on folate transport characteristics in an immortalized rat IEC-6 cell line that was found to exhibit the predominant influx activity for methotrexate (MTX) at pH 5.5 with a low level of activity at pH 7.4. Transfection of this cell line with an RFC1 construct resulted in clones exhibiting increased MTX uptake at both the pHs and high folic acid uptake only at the low pH. For the two clones with the highest level of transport activity, relative MTX influx at the two pHs was reversed. Moreover, the low pH MTX influx activity ([MTX](e) = 0.5 microM) was markedly inhibited by 20 microM folic acid while influx at neutral pH was not. Furthermore, in the presence and absence of glucose at low pH, MTX and folic acid influx activity was inhibited by azide, while MTX influx at pH 7.4 was stimulated by azide in the absence of glucose but was unchanged in the presence of glucose and azide. This was contrasted with the results of transfection of the same RFC1 construct into an L1210 murine leukemia cell line bearing a nonfunctional endogenous carrier. In this case, the activity expressed was only at pH 7.4. These data indicate that RFC1 can exhibit two distinct types of folate transport activities in intestinal cells that must depend on tissue-specific modulators.","['Rajgopal, A', 'Sierra, E E', 'Zhao, R', 'Goldman, I D']","['Rajgopal A', 'Sierra EE', 'Zhao R', 'Goldman ID']","['Department of Medicine, Albert Einstein College of Medicine Cancer Center, Bronx, New York 10461, USA.']",['eng'],"['CA-39807/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-82621/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Am J Physiol Cell Physiol,American journal of physiology.

The stimulation was highly envelope protein-specific, and also time- and dose-dependent. The activation pattern was similar to that elicited by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) since the envelope protein showed a synergistic effect on macrophage activation in conjunction with interferon gamma (IFN-gamma). Furthermore, deacylated LPS as a competitive inhibitor of LPS showed inhibition of envelope protein-mediated macrophage activation.

Recently we reported that B16 murine melanoma cells are able to produce IL-18, which is involved in the regulation of intracellular reactive oxygen intermediates (ROI) and Fas-ligand expression, indicating that IL-18 plays key role in the tumor activity of melanoma. In this study, we investigated the pattern of IL-18 expression in the human system. IL-18 production was tested by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) assay in various tumor cell lines, including Raji (Burkitt's lymphoma), IM-9 (B lymphoblast), Jurkat (acute T cell leukemia), SK-MES-1 (squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) cell line), SK-MEL-2, G-361, DM-4, and DX-3 (melanoma cell lines). ELISA tests showed that IL-18 was highly expressed in malignant skin tumors such as SK-MES-1, SK-MEL-2, G-361, DM-4, and DX-3 cell lines, thus suggesting that IL-18 production may be associated with the malignancy of skin tumors. Here, we report that enhanced IL-18 expression is positively correlated with malignant skin tumors such as SCC and melanoma, suggesting the importance role of IL-18 in malignancy of skin tumors. Taken together, expression of IL-18 by tumor cells in human skin tissue may provide an important clue to understand the pathogenesis of malignant skin tumors.","['Park, H', 'Byun, D', 'Kim, T S', 'Kim, Y I', 'Kang, J S', 'Hahm, E S', 'Kim, S H', 'Lee, W J', 'Song, H K', 'Yoon, D Y', 'Kang, C J', 'Lee, C', 'Houh, D', 'Kim, H', 'Cho, B', 'Kim, Y', 'Yang, Y H', 'Min, K H', 'Cho, D H']","['Park H', 'Byun D', 'Kim TS', 'Kim YI', 'Kang JS', 'Hahm ES', 'Kim SH', 'Lee WJ', 'Song HK', 'Yoon DY', 'Kang CJ', 'Lee C', 'Houh D', 'Kim H', 'Cho B', 'Kim Y', 'Yang YH', 'Min KH', 'Cho DH']","[""Department of Dermatology, St. Mary's Hospital, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, South Korea.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Immunol Lett,Immunology letters,7910006,"['0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (Interleukin-18)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Carcinoma, Basal Cell/immunology/metabolism', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/immunology/metabolism', 'Culture Media, Conditioned/pharmacology', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Interferon-gamma/biosynthesis', 'Interleukin-18/*biosynthesis/immunology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/drug effects/metabolism', 'Melanoma/immunology/metabolism', 'Skin Neoplasms/immunology/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/10/16 10:00,2002/01/26 10:01,['2001/10/16 10:00'],"['2001/10/16 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/26 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/16 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0165247801002784 [pii]', '10.1016/s0165-2478(01)00278-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Immunol Lett. 2001 Dec 3;79(3):215-9. doi: 10.1016/s0165-2478(01)00278-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, Th1-type cytokines promote allograft rejection and, therefore, may compromise pregnancy, whereas Th2-type cytokines, which inhibit Th1 responses, may allow allograft tolerance. In addition, T cell production of Leukemia Inhibitory Factor (LIF) and macrophage-stimulating factor (M-CSF), which are essential for embryo implantation and development, are up-regulated by IL-4 and progesterone.

The butanol-soluble extract of the bamboo leaves was found to have a significant antioxidant activity, as measured by scavenging the stable 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radical and the superoxide anion radical (O(2)(-)) in the xanthine/xanthine oxidase assay system. Antioxidant activity-directed fractionation of the extract led to the isolation and characterization of three structural isomeric chlorogenic acid derivatives: 3-O-(3'-methylcaffeoyl)quinic acid (1), 5-O-caffeoyl-4-methylquinic acid (2), and 3-O-caffeoyl-1-methylquinic acid (3). Compounds 2 and 3 were isolated and characterized for the first time from the natural products. In the DPPH scavenging assay as well as in the iron-induced rat microsomal lipid peroxidation system, compounds 2 (IC(50) = 8.8 and 19.2 microM) and 3 (IC(50) = 6.9 and 14.6 microM) showed approximately 2-4 times higher antioxidant activity than did chlorogenic acid (IC(50) = 12.3 and 28.3 microM) and other related hydroxycinnamates such as caffeic acid (IC(50) =13.7 and 25.5 microM) and ferulic acid (IC(50) = 36.5 and 56.9 microM). Among the three compounds, compound 1 yielded the weakest antioxidant activity, and the DPPH scavenging and lipid peroxidation inhibitory activity (IC(50) = 16.0 and 29.8 microM) was lower than those of chlorogenic and caffeic acids. All three compounds exhibited both superoxide scavenging activities and inhibitory effects on xanthine oxidase. Their superoxide anion (O(2)(-)) scavenging activities (IC(50) = 1, 4.3 microM; 2, 2.8 microM; and 3, 1.2 microM) were markedly stronger than those of ascorbic acid (IC(50) = 56.0 microM), alpha-tocopherol (IC(50) > 100 microM), and other test compounds, although their inhibition effects on xanthine oxidase may contribute to the potent scavenging activity. alpha-Tocopherol exerted a significant inhibitory effect (65.5% of the control) on superoxide generation in 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-induced human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells, and compound 3 showed moderate activity (36.0%). On the other hand, other compounds including 1, 2, chlorogenic acid, and other antioxidants were weakly active (24.8-10.1%) in the suppression of superoxide generation.","['Kweon, M H', 'Hwang, H J', 'Sung, H C']","['Kweon MH', 'Hwang HJ', 'Sung HC']","['Graduate School of Biotechnology, Korea University, 5-1 ka Anam-dong, Sungbuk-ku, Seoul 136-701, Korea.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Agric Food Chem,Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,0374755,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Biphenyl Compounds)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Free Radical Scavengers)', '0 (Picrates)', '11062-77-4 (Superoxides)', '318ADP12RI (Chlorogenic Acid)', '755BO701MA (Bepridil)', 'DFD3H4VGDH (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl)', 'EC 1.17.3.2 (Xanthine Oxidase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antioxidants/*analysis/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Bepridil/*analogs & derivatives/chemistry', 'Biphenyl Compounds', 'Chlorogenic Acid/*analogs & derivatives/analysis/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Free Radical Scavengers', 'Lipid Peroxidation', 'Microsomes, Liver/metabolism', '*Picrates', 'Plant Leaves/*chemistry', 'Poaceae/*chemistry', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Superoxides/chemistry', 'Xanthine Oxidase/antagonists & inhibitors']",2001/10/16 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/10/16 10:00'],"['2001/10/16 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/16 10:00 [entrez]']","['jf010514x [pii]', '10.1021/jf010514x [doi]']",ppublish,J Agric Food Chem. 2001 Oct;49(10):4646-55. doi: 10.1021/jf010514x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite intense interest in the toxicity of PM2.5, the mechanisms by which it causes illnesses are poorly understood. Since the principal source of airborne fine particles is combustion and combustion sources generate free radicals, we suspected that PM2.5 may contain radicals. Using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), we examined samples of PM2.5 and found large quantities of radicals with characteristics similar to semiquinone radicals. Semiquinone radicals are known to undergo redox cycling and ultimately produce biologically damaging hydroxyl radicals. Aqueous extracts of PM2.5 samples induced damage to DNA in human cells and supercoiled phage DNA. PM2.5-mediated DNA damage was abolished by superoxide dismutase, catalase, and deferoxamine, implicating superoxide radical, hydrogen peroxide, and the hydroxyl radical in the reactions inducing DNA damage.","['Dellinger, B', 'Pryor, W A', 'Cueto, R', 'Squadrito, G L', 'Hegde, V', 'Deutsch, W A']","['Dellinger B', 'Pryor WA', 'Cueto R', 'Squadrito GL', 'Hegde V', 'Deutsch WA']","['Department of Chemistry, Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, Louisiana 70803, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Chem Res Toxicol,Chemical research in toxicology,8807448,"['0 (Air Pollutants)', '0 (DNA, Superhelical)', '0 (Free Radicals)', '0 (Oxidants)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'EC 1.11.1.6 (Catalase)', 'EC 1.15.1.1 (Superoxide Dismutase)', 'J06Y7MXW4D (Deferoxamine)']",IM,"['Air Pollutants/*toxicity', 'Bacteriophages', 'Catalase/metabolism', 'Comet Assay', '*DNA Damage', 'DNA, Superhelical/*drug effects', 'Deferoxamine/chemistry', 'Electron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Environmental Monitoring', 'Free Radicals/chemistry/*toxicity', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/chemistry', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', 'Oxidants/chemistry', 'Particle Size', 'Superoxide Dismutase/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/10/16 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/10/16 10:00'],"['2001/10/16 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/16 10:00 [entrez]']","['tx010050x [pii]', '10.1021/tx010050x [doi]']",ppublish,Chem Res Toxicol. 2001 Oct;14(10):1371-7. doi: 10.1021/tx010050x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Prospective study of 101 client-owned cats with naturally-occurring lymphosarcoma. PROCEDURE: Western blot analysis, ELISA and immunochromatography were used to detect FIV antibodies in serum from cats with lymphosarcoma. RESULTS: On the basis of Western blot analysis (which was considered the most accurate method for determining FIV status), 50/101 (50%) of cats with naturally-occurring lymphosarcoma were positive for FIV antibodies. Of these 50 cats, 35 had tumours of B-cell phenotype, 13 had T-cell tumours and 2 had tumours classified as non-B/non-T. Tumours from eight of these FIV-positive cats contained FeLV gene sequences, including a 9-month-old cat with FeLV antigenaemia. Compared with FlV-negative cats with lymphosarcoma, FIV-positive cats were more likely to be domestic crossbreds (P = 0.004), male (P = 0.048) and have atypical (especially nasal) forms of lymphosarcoma (P = 0.09). Only 39 of 107 (36%) blood or sera tested using ELISA were positive for FIV antibodies (including 5 false-positives). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of FIV infection was considerably higher in our cohort of cats compared with series of lymphosarcoma cases from the Northern hemisphere. A positive FIV status was strongly associated with lymphosarcoma in Australian cats and it is possible that this infection may predispose to the development of lymphoid neoplasia. The presence of FIV infection would have been underestimated if commercial kits alone had been used for serology.","['Gabor, L J', 'Love, D N', 'Malik, R', 'Canfield, P J']","['Gabor LJ', 'Love DN', 'Malik R', 'Canfield PJ']","['Department of Veterinary Anatomy and Pathology, The University of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Aust Vet J,Australian veterinary journal,0370616,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/*blood', 'Blotting, Western/veterinary', 'Cat Diseases/*epidemiology/*virology', 'Cats', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay/veterinary', 'Female', 'Immunodeficiency Virus, Feline/*immunology/isolation & purification', 'Leukemia, Feline/epidemiology/virology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/epidemiology/*veterinary/virology', 'Male', 'New South Wales/epidemiology', 'Prevalence', 'Prospective Studies']",2001/10/16 10:00,2001/10/26 10:01,['2001/10/16 10:00'],"['2001/10/16 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/26 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/16 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1751-0813.2001.tb10742.x [doi]'],ppublish,Aust Vet J. 2001 Aug;79(8):540-5. doi: 10.1111/j.1751-0813.2001.tb10742.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Data from seven patients with cutaneous vasculitis (four cases), neutrophilic dermatosis (one case), relapsing polychondritis (one case), and possible erythema elevatum diutinum (one case) in association with myelodysplastic syndrome (refractory anaemia RA, RA with excess of blasts--RAEB-, RAEB in transformation RAEBt, chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia--CMML-), and analysis of the literature were reviewed. RESULTS: The cutaneous manifestations of myelodysplastic syndrome may or may not be specific, and may reveal hemopathy transformation. The cutaneous vasculitis are the most frequent and polymorphic. The relation with neutrophilic dermatosis is more specific; they are a spectrum of diseases including pyoderma gangrenosum, Sweet's syndrome, erythema elevatum diutinum (nuclear segmentation anomalies of neutrophils both in the skin and in the blood are a biological marker of the association).

Factors contributing to fatigue include anemia, weight loss, fever, pain, medication, and infection. In cancer patients, many of these factors are influenced by a frequently disrupted balance between endogenous cytokine levels and their natural antagonists. Indeed, cancer cells and the immune system appear to overexpress a range of cytokines in patients with malignancies. Some of these cytokines act as autocrine or paracrine growth factors for the neoplastic tissue while simultaneously causing secondary symptoms related to fatigue. For instance, cancer-associated anemia may be due to a blunted erythropoietin response and/or cytokines (interleukin-1 [IL-1], IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha [TNF-alpha]), which suppress erythropoiesis. Cancerous cachexia, a wasting syndrome and a hallmark of cancer, can be attributed to loss of appetite or enhanced energy expenditure. Several different interleukins, as well as TNF, interferon-gamma, and leukemia inhibitory factor, act as cachectins in animal models. Similarly, fever and night sweats are influenced by pyrogenic cytokines. Recently, molecules that function as cytokine antagonists have been identified. These molecules may be exploitable in combating the components of cancer-related fatigue, and may inhibit tumor growth as well.","['Kurzrock, R']",['Kurzrock R'],"['Department of Bioimmunotherapy, The University of Texas M.

Glutamine deprivation-mediated cell shrinkage promoted a ligand-independent activation of the CD95-mediated apoptotic pathway. Cell transfection with plasmids expressing FADD-DN or v-Flip viral proteins pointed to a functional clustering of CD95 receptors at the cell surface with activation of the 'extrinsic pathway' caspase cascade. Accordingly, cell shrinkage did not induce apoptosis in CD95 receptor-negative lymphoma L1210 cells. Replacement of glutamine with surrogate compatible osmolytes counteracted cell volume decrement and protected the CD95-expressing cells from apoptosis. A glutamine deprivation-dependent cell shrinkage with activation of the CD95-mediated pathway was also observed when asparaginase was added to the medium. Asparagine depletion had no role in this process. The cell-size shrinkage-dependent apoptosis induced by glutamine restriction in CD95-expressing leukemic cells may therefore be of clinical relevance in amidohydrolase enzyme therapies.","['Fumarola, C', 'Zerbini, A', 'Guidotti, G G']","['Fumarola C', 'Zerbini A', 'Guidotti GG']","['Department of Experimental Medicine, Section of Immunology and Molecular Pathology, University of Parma, 43100 Parma, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cell Death Differ,Cell death and differentiation,9437445,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Culture Media)', '0 (FADD protein, human)', '0 (FASLG protein, human)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Fas-Associated Death Domain Protein)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '0RH81L854J (Glutamine)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",IM,"['*Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Asparaginase/pharmacology', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics/physiology', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Cell Size', 'Clone Cells', 'Culture Media', 'Fas Ligand Protein', 'Fas-Associated Death Domain Protein', 'Glutamine/*physiology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/metabolism/*pathology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/physiology', 'Mutation', '*Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'fas Receptor/*physiology']",2001/10/13 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/10/13 10:00'],"['2001/01/22 00:00 [received]', '2001/04/27 00:00 [revised]', '2001/05/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2001/10/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/13 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.cdd.4400902 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Death Differ. 2001 Oct;8(10):1004-13. doi: 10.1038/sj.cdd.4400902.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we demonstrate that c-myc plays a role in triggering apoptosis in CEM T leukaemia cells exposed to progressive medium exhaustion. Indeed starved cells undergo apoptosis in the presence of constitutively elevated c-myc expression and the phorbol ester, phorbol 12-miristate 13-acetate (PMA), which rescues cells from apoptosis, induces complete c-myc down-regulation. We also investigate the hypothesis that ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), a transcriptional target of c-myc, is a down-stream mediator of c-myc driven apoptosis. We demonstrate that PMA induces in starved cells an earlier and larger decrease in ODC expression (mRNA and activity) and intracellular polyamine content, compared to untreated starved cells. Moreover we show that alpha-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO), an irreversible inhibitor of ODC enzymatic activity, effectively reduces, while exogenous added polyamines enhance apoptosis in starved cells. All these data indicate that ODC and polyamines may act as facilitating factors in triggering apoptosis induced by growth/survival factors withdrawal.","['Tiberio, L', 'Maier, J A', 'Schiaffonati, L']","['Tiberio L', 'Maier JA', 'Schiaffonati L']","['Department of Biomedical Sciences and Biotechnology, University of Brescia, Via Valsabbina, 19, 25123 Brescia, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cell Death Differ,Cell death and differentiation,9437445,"['0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Polyamines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 4.1.1.17 (Ornithine Decarboxylase)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Cell Cycle', 'Culture Media', 'Down-Regulation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Ornithine Decarboxylase/genetics/*physiology', 'Polyamines/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/10/13 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/10/13 10:00'],"['2000/04/14 00:00 [received]', '2001/02/07 00:00 [revised]', '2001/05/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2001/10/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/13 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.cdd.4400909 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Death Differ. 2001 Oct;8(10):967-76. doi: 10.1038/sj.cdd.4400909.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because many processes involving RNA metabolism are spatially organized within the cell, we examined the subcellular distribution of a human DEAD box protein, DDX1, to identify possible biological functions. Immunofluorescence labeling of DDX1 demonstrated that in addition to widespread punctate nucleoplasmic labeling, DDX1 is found in discrete nuclear foci approximately 0.5 microm in diameter. Costaining with anti-Sm and anti-promyelocytic leukemia (PML) antibodies indicates that DDX1 foci are frequently located next to Cajal (coiled) bodies and less frequently, to PML bodies. Most importantly, costaining with anti-CstF-64 antibody indicates that DDX1 foci colocalize with cleavage bodies. By microscopic fluorescence resonance energy transfer, we show that labeled DDX1 resides within a Forster distance of 10 nm of labeled CstF-64 protein in both the nucleoplasm and within cleavage bodies. Coimmunoprecipitation analysis indicates that a proportion of CstF-64 protein resides in the same complex as DDX1.

In bone marrow (BM) biopsy specimens, this distinction can be particularly difficult. Although cyclin D1 immunostaining and molecular detection of the t(11;14) translocation are highly specific markers for MCL, they fail to detect a proportion of cases. We have recently described that MCL typically lacks detectable expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27(kip1) protein by immunostaining, which is expressed at high levels in most small B-cell NHL inversely correlated to the proliferation rate. We therefore examined whether p27(kip1) immunostaining could be a useful adjunct for the differential diagnosis of small B-cell NHL infiltrates in the BM. Trephine BM biopsy specimens of 96 patients, including well-characterized MCL (19 cases), B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (27 cases), follicular lymphoma (18 cases), hairy cell leukemia (22 cases), and marginal zone lymphoma (10 cases) as well as 10 reactive BM, including five with benign lymphoid aggregates were investigated. In addition, the presence of a t(11;14) translocation involving the major translocation cluster was studied by PCR in all MCL. All cases of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia, follicular lymphoma, and marginal zone lymphoma revealed a strong p27(kip1) nuclear staining in the majority of neoplastic cells. Fourteen (78%) cases of MCL were p27(kip1)-negative in the tumor cells, whereas four cases revealed a weak nuclear positivity. Seventeen (77%) cases of hairy cell leukemia were also either completely negative for p27(kip1) or showed a faint positive staining in a minority of the neoplastic cells. Nine of 19 cases (47%) of MCL showed a bcl1 rearrangement involving the major translocation cluster region. These findings demonstrate that p27(kip1) immunostaining is a valuable additional marker for the differential diagnosis of small B-cell NHL infiltrates in BM biopsies. The reduction or lack of p27(kip1) protein expression in MCL, as well as in hairy cell leukemia, might be an important event in the pathogenesis of these disorders.","['Kremer, M', 'Dirnhofer, S', 'Nickl, A', 'Hoefler, H', 'Quintanilla-Martinez, L', 'Fend, F']","['Kremer M', 'Dirnhofer S', 'Nickl A', 'Hoefler H', 'Quintanilla-Martinez L', 'Fend F']","['Institute of Pathology, Technical University Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mod Pathol,"Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc",8806605,"['0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)']",IM,"['Biopsy/methods', 'Bone Marrow/chemistry/*pathology', 'CD3 Complex/analysis', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/*analysis', 'Cyclin D1/analysis/genetics', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/metabolism/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/metabolism/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/metabolism/pathology', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*analysis']",2001/10/13 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/10/13 10:00'],"['2001/10/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/13 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/modpathol.3880429 [doi]'],ppublish,Mod Pathol. 2001 Oct;14(10):1022-9. doi: 10.1038/modpathol.3880429.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, possibilities of functional interplay between members of these two families have not been addressed. Here we show that, in hemopoietic cells, recruitment of the C-terminal VCA (Verprolin homology, Cofilin homology, Acidic) domain of WASp at the plasma membrane by a ligand technique using rapamycin as an intermediate is not sufficient to elicit efficient Arp2/3 complex-mediated actin polymerization. Other domains of WASp, in particular the proline-rich domain, are required for the formation of actin-rich structures. An in vitro analysis demonstrates that the proline-rich domain of WASp binds VASP with an affinity of approximately 10(6) M(-1). In addition, WASp and VASP both accumulate in actin-rich phagocytic cups. Finally, in a reconstituted motility medium, VASP enhances actin-based propulsion of WASp-coated beads in a fashion reminiscent of its effect on Listeria movement. We propose that VASP and WASp cooperation is essential in stimulating actin assembly and membrane protrusion at the leading edge.","['Castellano, F', 'Le Clainche, C', 'Patin, D', 'Carlier, M F', 'Chavrier, P']","['Castellano F', 'Le Clainche C', 'Patin D', 'Carlier MF', 'Chavrier P']","[""Laboratoire de la Dynamique de la Membrane et du Cytosquelette, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique UMR 144, Institut Curie, 26 rue d'Ulm, 75241 Paris Cedex 5, France.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,"['0 (Actin-Related Protein 2)', '0 (Actin-Related Protein 3)', '0 (Actins)', '0 (Biopolymers)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Cytoskeletal Proteins)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Microfilament Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Was protein, rat)', '0 (Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome Protein)', '0 (vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein)', '9DLQ4CIU6V (Proline)', 'EC 5.2.1.- (Tacrolimus Binding Proteins)', 'W36ZG6FT64 (Sirolimus)']",IM,"['Actin-Related Protein 2', 'Actin-Related Protein 3', 'Actins/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Biopolymers', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/chemistry/*physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Movement', 'Cricetinae', '*Cytoskeletal Proteins', 'Dimerization', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Kidney', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/pathology', 'Ligands', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Mast Cells/metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Mesocricetus', 'Microfilament Proteins', 'Multigene Family', 'Phagocytosis', 'Phosphoproteins/chemistry/*physiology', 'Proline/chemistry', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Proteins/chemistry/*physiology', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/genetics/metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Sirolimus/metabolism', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tacrolimus Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome Protein']",2001/10/13 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/10/13 10:00'],"['2001/10/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/13 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/emboj/20.20.5603 [doi]'],ppublish,EMBO J. 2001 Oct 15;20(20):5603-14. doi: 10.1093/emboj/20.20.5603.,,,,,PMC125672,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS AND MATERIALS: From 1978 to 1994, 1,253 women with unilateral Stage I-II breast cancer underwent wide excision, axillary dissection, and radiation. The median follow-up was 8.9 years, with 446 patients followed for >or= 10 years. The median age was 55 years. Sixty-eight percent had T1 tumors and 74% were axillary-node negative. Radiation was directed to the breast only in 78%. Adjuvant therapy consisted of chemotherapy in 19%, tamoxifen in 19%, and both in 8%. Factors analyzed for their association with the cumulative incidence of all second malignancies, contralateral breast cancer, and non-breast cancer malignancy were: age, menopausal status, race, family history, obesity, smoking, tumor size, location, histology, pathologic nodal status, region(s) treated with radiation, and the use and type of adjuvant therapy. RESULTS: One hundred seventy-six women developed a second malignancy (87 contralateral breast cancers at a median interval of 5.8 years, and 98 non-breast cancer malignancies at a median interval of 7.2 years). Nine women had both a contralateral breast cancer and non-breast cancer second malignancy. The 5- and 10-year cumulative incidences of a second malignancy were 5% and 16% for all cancers, 3% and 7% for contralateral breast cancer, 3% and 8%, for all second non-breast cancer malignancies, and 1% and 5%, respectively, for second non-breast cancer malignancies, excluding skin cancers. Patient age was a significant factor for contralateral breast cancer and non-breast cancer second malignancy. Young age was associated with an increased risk of contralateral breast cancer, while older age was associated with an increased the risk of a second non-breast cancer second malignancy. A positive family history increased the risk of contralateral breast cancer, but not non-breast cancer malignancies. The risk of a contralateral breast cancer increased as the number of affected relatives increased. Tamoxifen resulted in a nonsignificant decrease in contralateral breast cancer and an increase in non-breast cancer second malignancies. The 5-and 10-year cumulative incidences for leukemia and lung cancer were 0.08% and 0.2%, and 0.8% and 1%, respectively. There was no significant effect of chemotherapy or the regions treated with radiation on contralateral breast cancer or non-breast cancer second malignancy. The most common types of second non-breast cancer malignancies were skin cancers, followed by gynecologic malignancies (endometrial), and gastrointestinal malignancies (colorectal and pancreas). CONCLUSION: The 10-years cumulative incidence of a second cancer in this study was 16%. Young age and family history predicted for an increased risk of contralateral breast cancer, and older age predicted for an increased risk of non-breast cancer malignancy. The majority of patients treated with conservative surgery and radiation with or without adjuvant systemic therapy will not develop a second cancer. Long-term follow-up is important to document the risk and patterns of second cancer, and knowledge of this risk and the patterns will influence surveillance and prevention strategies.","['Fowble, B', 'Hanlon, A', 'Freedman, G', 'Nicolaou, N', 'Anderson, P']","['Fowble B', 'Hanlon A', 'Freedman G', 'Nicolaou N', 'Anderson P']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, PA 19111, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",United States,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",7603616,,IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Axilla', 'Breast Neoplasms/epidemiology/*radiotherapy/*surgery', 'Carcinoma, Ductal, Breast/epidemiology/radiotherapy/surgery', 'Carcinoma, Lobular/epidemiology/radiotherapy/surgery', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Lymph Node Excision', 'Lymphatic Irradiation', 'Mastectomy, Segmental', 'Middle Aged', '*Neoplasms, Second Primary/epidemiology', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors']",2001/10/13 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/10/13 10:00'],"['2001/10/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/13 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0360-3016(01)01665-0 [pii]', '10.1016/s0360-3016(01)01665-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2001 Nov 1;51(3):679-90. doi: 10.1016/s0360-3016(01)01665-0.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since CLL cells associate intimately with one another at sites of tissue involvement, we examined the hitherto unproven possibility that homotypic interactions between the malignant cells might reduce their propensity to undergo spontaneous cell death. In a series of experiments in which highly pure CLL-cell populations were cultured on a non-adherent surface, cell viability was found to increase markedly with the level of crowding at the bottom of the culture vessel. The effect was observed among unevenly distributed cells within a single culture vessel and did not require direct cell-cell contact. This indicates that cell survival was being regulated in an autocrine fashion by locally acting soluble products. Conditioned medium from crowded CLL cells enhanced the survival of autologous non-crowded cells, indicating that at least some of the autocrine survival factors produced by CLL cells could accumulate in the extracellular environment. In addition, the survival of non-crowded CLL cells was markedly enhanced by co-culturing them with an excess of autologous fixed cells. This protective effect of direct cell-cell contact was mediated by specific surface structures since it was abrogated by pre-treating the fixed cells with neuraminidase. Our results provide the first direct demonstration that the survival of cultured CLL cells is enhanced by homotypic interactions. We speculate that these protective effects may contribute to the accumulation of CLL cells in vivo, and that further elucidation of the underlying mechanisms may lead to novel therapeutic strategies.","['Pettitt, A R', 'Moran, E C', 'Cawley, J C']","['Pettitt AR', 'Moran EC', 'Cawley JC']","['Department of Haematology, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, UK. andrew.pettitt@rlbuh-tr.nwest.nhs.uk']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (CD5 Antigens)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', 'EC 3.4.- (Endopeptidases)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD19/metabolism/physiology', 'Autocrine Communication', 'CD5 Antigens/metabolism/physiology', '*Cell Communication', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Endopeptidases/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*pathology', 'Peptide Mapping', 'Receptors, IgE/metabolism/physiology']",2001/10/13 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/10/13 10:00'],"['2001/10/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/13 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0145-2126(01)00067-4 [pii]', '10.1016/s0145-2126(01)00067-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2001 Nov;25(11):1003-12. doi: 10.1016/s0145-2126(01)00067-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have investigated the expression of topo IIalpha in leukemic cells from 25 patients with acute leukemia by flow cytometry, separating cells of different cell cycle phases. We demonstrated that 9/25 samples showed >50% positive cells in G0/G1, and another five samples showed >20%. This finding could possibly provide an explanation to previous difficulties in correlating topo IIalpha expression with clinical outcome. Six of eight patients, where >20% of the cells in G0/G1 were positive for topo IIalpha, entered CR, compared to one of five patients with <20% topo IIalpha positive cells in G0/G1.

However, concerns have arisen about the potential of its interaction with other drugs due to the induction of cytochrome P450 isozymes 1A2 and 3A4 by the components hypericin and hyperforin, respectively. Structurally similar natural products are often employed as antitumor agents due to their action as inhibitors of DNA topoisomerases, nuclear enzymes that modify DNA during cellular proliferation. Preliminary findings that hypericin inhibited the DNA relaxation activity of topoisomerase IIalpha (topo II; EC 5.99.1.3) led us to investigate the mechanism of enzyme inhibition. Rather than stabilizing the enzyme in covalent complexes with DNA (cleavage complexes), hypericin inhibited the enzyme prior to DNA cleavage. In vitro assays indicate that hypericin is a potent antagonist of cleavage complex stabilization by the chemotherapeutics etoposide and amsacrine. This antagonism appears to be due to the ability of hypericin to intercalate or distort DNA structure, thereby precluding topo II binding and/or DNA cleavage. Supporting its non-DNA damaging, catalytic inhibition of topo II, hypericin was shown to be equitoxic to both wild-type and amsacrine-resistant HL-60 leukemia cell lines. Moreover, hypericin was incapable of stimulating DNA damage-responsive gene promoters that are activated by etoposide. As with the in vitro topo II assay, antagonism of DNA damage stimulated by 30 microM etoposide was evident in leukemia cells pretreated with 5 microM hypericin.

Several studies have defined one region of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at 13q14 that seems to reside in a DNA segment of 7.1 cM between genetic markers D13S263 and D13S153. To define the smallest region of overlap (SRO) for deletion at 13q14, we first applied tissue microdissection and multiplex PCR to detect homozygous deletion and/or hemizygous deletion at 13q14 in 134 prostate cancer specimens from 114 patients. We detected deletions at markers D13S1227, D13S1272, and A005O48 in 13 (10%) of these tumor specimens. Of the 13 tumors with deletions, 12 were either poorly differentiated primary tumors or metastases of prostate cancer. To fine-map the deletion region, we then constructed a high-resolution YAC/BAC/STS/EST physical map based on experimental and database analyses. Several markers encompassing the deletion region were analyzed for homozygous deletion and/or hemizygous deletion in 61 cell lines/xenografts derived from human cancers of the prostate, breast, ovary, endometrium, cervix, and bladder, and a region of deletion was defined by duplex PCR assay between markers A005X38 and WI-7773. We also analyzed LOH at 13q14 in the 61 cell lines/xenografts using the homozygosity mapping of deletion approach and 26 microsatellite markers. We found 24 (39%) of the cell lines/xenografts to show LOH at 13q14 and defined a region of LOH by markers M1 and M5. Combination of homozygous or hemizygous deletion and LOH results defined the SRO for deletion to be an 800-kb DNA interval between A005X38 and M5. There are six known genes located in or close to the SRO for deletion. This region of deletion is at least 2 Mb centromeric to the RB1 tumor-suppressor gene and the leukemia-associated genes 1 and 2, each of which is located at 13q14. These data suggest that the 800-kb DNA segment with deletion contains a gene whose deletion may be important for the development of prostate and other cancers. This study also provides a framework for the fine-mapping, cloning, and identification of a novel tumor-suppressor gene at 13q14.","['Chen, C', 'Frierson, H F Jr', 'Haggerty, P F', 'Theodorescu, D', 'Gregory, C W', 'Dong, J T']","['Chen C', 'Frierson HF Jr', 'Haggerty PF', 'Theodorescu D', 'Gregory CW', 'Dong JT']","['Department of Pathology, University of Virginia Health System, Charlottesville, Virginia 22908, USA.']",['eng'],['CA85560/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Genomics,Genomics,8800135,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Alleles', '*Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 13/*genetics', 'Female', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Homozygote', 'Humans', 'Loss of Heterozygosity', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Physical Chromosome Mapping', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/10/13 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/10/13 10:00'],"['2001/10/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/13 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1006/geno.2001.6631 [doi]', 'S0888-7543(01)96631-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Genomics. 2001 Oct;77(3):135-44. doi: 10.1006/geno.2001.6631.,,,,,,,,,"['GENBANK/G67433', 'GENBANK/G67434', 'GENBANK/G67435', 'GENBANK/G67436', 'GENBANK/G67437', 'GENBANK/G67438', 'GENBANK/G67439', 'GENBANK/G67440', 'GENBANK/G67441', 'GENBANK/G67442', 'GENBANK/G67443', 'GENBANK/G67444', 'GENBANK/G67445', 'GENBANK/G67446', 'GENBANK/G67447', 'GENBANK/G67448', 'GENBANK/G67449', 'GENBANK/G67450', 'GENBANK/G67451', 'GENBANK/G67452', 'GENBANK/G67453']",,,,,,,,,,,

However many attempts were made to explain it, the mechanism underlying this effect still remains unclear. Our results suggest that the acquired resistance to apoptosis-inducing agents in HL-60 cells is not mediated by the CD95 receptor/ligand system. The expression of CD95 on the surface of HL-60 cells is very low and does not change during the calcitriol-induced differentiation of HL-60 cells. Studies presented here provide a strong indication that this receptor is unable to transmit the death signal in either differentiated or undifferentiated HL-60 cells. We therefore asked if evading apoptosis by differentiated human leukemia HL-60 cells may be caused by their increased sensitivity to growth factors contained in fetal calf serum. This study demonstrates that HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cells, differentiated by exposure to calcitriol, undergo apoptosis in serum-free conditions. As low as 1% of fetal calf serum is enough to prevent cell death of differentiated HL-60 cells. The ability of 1% fetal calf serum to prevent apoptosis can be blocked by the specific inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, LY294002. We then tried to find out which component of fetal calf serum may be able to prevent serum-free cell death of differentiated cells. It appeared that serum-free cell death of differentiated HL-60 cells is reversed by addition of 10 microM insulin to the culture medium. The antiapoptotic activity of insulin can be inhibited by LY294002. Moreover, insulin increases the viability of differentiated, but not of undifferentiated, HL-60 cells.","['Marcinkowska, E', 'Chrobak, A', 'Wiedlocha, A']","['Marcinkowska E', 'Chrobak A', 'Wiedlocha A']","['Department of Reproductive Immunology, Ludwik Hirszfeld Institute of Immunology and Experimental Therapy, Polish Academy of Sciences, Weigl st. 12, Wroclaw, 53-114, Poland. marcinko@immuno.iitd.pan']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (Culture Media, Serum-Free)', '0 (Insulin)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '27432CM55Q (Serum Albumin, Bovine)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Calcitriol/*pharmacology', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Culture Media, Serum-Free', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Insulin/*pharmacology', 'Monocytes/drug effects', 'Serum Albumin, Bovine/pharmacology', 'fas Receptor/biosynthesis/*metabolism']",2001/10/13 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/10/13 10:00'],"['2001/10/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/13 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1006/excr.2001.5335 [doi]', 'S0014482701953352 [pii]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 2001 Oct 15;270(1):119-27. doi: 10.1006/excr.2001.5335.,['Copyright 2001 Academic Press.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In MMC-E cells actin and myosin were organized as belt-like structures at the edges of the border cells of the cell islands and also circumferentially in the cells inside the islands. The major change after transformation was the decrease of the actomyosin containing belt extending from cell to cell at the borders of the cell islands. Both MMC-E cells and the MSV-transformed cells contained keratin as a juxtanuclear granular aggregate whereas the MuLV-transformed cells showed bright fibrillar arrays of keratin. Both virus-transformed cell lines showed enhanced vimentin-specific fluorescence and analysis of their cytoskeletal polypeptides confirmed the result.

Firstly, ligand binding assay (LBA) revealed that control (unstimulated) THP-1 cells express type I (high affinity, limited capacity) ER in the nuclear fraction only, whilst treatment of cells with TPA resulted in the appearance of type I ER in the soluble fraction as well, with the 50 ng/ml dose and the 48 h incubation time being the most effective experimental condition. A concomitant increase of type II ER was also seen in both soluble and nuclear cell fractions. Unstimulated THP-1 cells were found to be ER negative by immunocytochemistry; conversely, cells exposed to 50 ng/ml TPA for 48 h stained positively for ER, with the majority of cells having a strong nuclear staining. Scrutiny of ER mRNA expression using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction showed the presence of a wild type ER transcript in both control and TPA-treated THP-1 cells, though levels of ER mRNA were found to be comparatively higher in the latter. This combined evidence would imply that the TPA-induced differentiation of THP-1 cells is accompanied by the rise of high affinity (type I) ER, suggesting that estrogens may play a role in the regulation of macrophage activity during the inflammatory and/or the immune response.","['Cutolo, M', 'Carruba, G', 'Villaggio, B', 'Coviello, D A', 'Dayer, J M', 'Campisi, I', 'Miele, M', 'Stefano, R', 'Castagnetta, L A']","['Cutolo M', 'Carruba G', 'Villaggio B', 'Coviello DA', 'Dayer JM', 'Campisi I', 'Miele M', 'Stefano R', 'Castagnetta LA']","['Division of Rheumatology, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Genoa, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,"['0 (Ligands)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Estrogen)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Inflammation', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Ligands', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Receptors, Estrogen/*biosynthesis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', '*Up-Regulation']",2001/10/12 10:00,2002/01/31 10:01,['2001/10/12 10:00'],"['2001/10/12 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/31 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/12 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/jcb.1237 [pii]', '10.1002/jcb.1237 [doi]']",ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 2001 Aug 21-Sep 5;83(3):390-400. doi: 10.1002/jcb.1237.,"['Copyright 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Anecdotal reports suggest that cyclosporin A (CsA) may be beneficial for patients with CLL-associated pure red cell aplasia. In the current study, the authors investigated the use of CsA in the management of anemia or thrombocytopenia of presumed autoimmune etiology associated with CLL. METHODS: Thirty-one patients with CLL and anemia or thrombocytopenia of presumed autoimmune etiology were treated with CsA at a dose of 300 mg/day. Sixteen patients (52%) had anemia (hemoglobin <or= 11 g/dL) and 29 patients (94%) had thrombocytopenia (platelet count <or= 100 x 10(9)/L). Seventeen patients (55%) had cytopenia that developed during the course of treatment with fludarabine-based regimens. Nineteen patients (61%) had received prior therapy for this complication using steroids, intravenous immunoglobulin, and/or splenectomy. RESULTS: Eighteen patients (62%) with thrombocytopenia and 10 patients (63%) with anemia had a major response defined as an increase in the platelet count >or= 50 x 10(9)/L or an increase in hemoglobin >or= 3 g/dL. The median time to initial response was 3 weeks (range, 1-13 weeks) and the median time to best response was 10.5 weeks (range, 1-48 weeks). The median duration of response was 10 months (range, 1+-39+ months). Three patients with fludarabine-associated cytopenias were able to receive further therapy with fludarabine with a lesser decrease in the platelet count. A modest decrease in the tumor burden was observed in six patients. The most common toxicity was <or= Grade 2 (according to the National Cancer Institute's Common Toxicity Criteria) elevation of creatinine, which was observed in 6 patients (19%). Three patients developed opportunistic infections. CONCLUSIONS: CsA is an effective alternative for the treatment of anemia or thrombocytopenia of suspected autoimmune etiology, including those cases occurring in the course of treatment with fludarabine. A modest antileukemic effect was observed in some patients.","['Cortes, J', ""O'Brien, S"", 'Loscertales, J', 'Kantarjian, H', 'Giles, F', 'Thomas, D', 'Koller, C', 'Keating, M']","['Cortes J', ""O'Brien S"", 'Loscertales J', 'Kantarjian H', 'Giles F', 'Thomas D', 'Koller C', 'Keating M']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas, M.

Because the results of standard regimens have been disappointing, high-dose chemotherapeutic regimens were investigated recently. In the absence of randomized trials, the relative merits of various treatment regimens are unknown. METHODS: The authors analyzed the outcome for 394 newly diagnosed patients treated between 1991 and 1999 with five regimens consisting of intermediate- or high-dose cytosine arabinoside (A) in combination with idarubicin (I), and introduced cyclophosphamide (C) and the new agents fludarabine (F) and topotecan (T) into new combinations with A. In addition to defining the role of high-intensity chemotherapy in the overall outcome for patients with RAEB-t and RAEB, the authors determined the relative merits of the five regimens (IA, FA, FAI, TA, and CAT), accounting for the nonrandom distribution of the prognostic covariates. RESULTS: The overall complete response (CR) rate of 58% was significantly associated with karyotype, performance status (PS), treatment in the laminar air flow room, duration of antecedent hematologic disorder and age, but not French-American-British or International Prognostic Scoring System risk categories. Multivariate analysis did not identify statistically significant differences in CR rates obtained with each regimen. Induction death rates increased with age with all but the TA regimen; they were lowest with TA (5.4%) and highest with FAI (20.7%), and these differences were significant in patients older than 65 years. The trend for time to death was the same as for time to recurrence in all groups. Multivariate analysis of time to death identified treatment regimen (FA, FAI, and CAT), cytogenetic status (-5/-7), increasing age, and PS greater than 2 as significant independent unfavorable prognostic factors. After prognostic variables were accounted for, survival with IA treatment remained superior to that of FA and FAI but comparable to TA, and CR duration was only marginally shorter with FA. Landmark analysis showed the overall survival of responders to be superior to that of nonresponders, the difference remaining significant after adjustment for prognostic covariates. CONCLUSIONS: Although the newer regimens did not improve outcome, TA and CAT produced results comparable to those of IA and may be considered treatment alternatives. The TA regimen was particularly effective in RAEB patients and could be delivered safely, with low induction mortality. Our results indicated that although CR seemed associated with survival advantage, innovative post-remission managements represent a challenge because improvement in outcome is not likely to come from intensified therapy.","['Beran, M', 'Shen, Y', 'Kantarjian, H', ""O'Brien, S"", 'Koller, C A', 'Giles, F J', 'Cortes, J', 'Thomas, D A', 'Faderl, S', 'Despa, S', 'Estey, E H']","['Beran M', 'Shen Y', 'Kantarjian H', ""O'Brien S"", 'Koller CA', 'Giles FJ', 'Cortes J', 'Thomas DA', 'Faderl S', 'Despa S', 'Estey EH']","['Department of Leukemia, University of Texas, M.

This study examines the presentation, diagnosis, treatment and progress of three patients who developed advanced melanoma concurrently with a lymphoid neoplasm (one NHL, two CLLs), in order to illustrate their association, discuss common aetiological factors and examine possible therapeutic options. As it is the melanoma rather than the lymphoid neoplasm that represents the bigger threat to overall survival, initial treatment should be targeted towards this cancer. However, because of the interplay between the diseases and the possible side-effects of the various treatments, the choice of adjuvant therapy requires careful consideration. Immunosuppression associated with chemotherapy may permit a more aggressive course for the melanoma, while locoregional radiotherapy is contraindicated following lymph node dissections. As immunotherapy is of benefit in the treatment of melanoma and has also been recently shown to be effective in the management of lymphoid neoplasia, we instituted interferon-alpha as adjuvant therapy for these patients, thereby utilizing a single agent to treat the dual pathologies.

Because hyperthermia has produced only limited results, attention has focused on searching for substances able to sensitize tumour cells to the effects of hyperthermia. The flavonoid quercetin has been reported to be a hyperthermic sensitizer in ovarian and uterine cervical tumours and in leukaemia. Quercetin and tamoxifen inhibit melanoma cell growth. We therefore investigated whether quercetin and tamoxifen can sensitize M10, M14 and MNT1 human melanoma cells to hyperthermia. We observed that both quercetin and tamoxifen synergize with hyperthermia (42.5 degrees C) in reducing the clonogenic activity of M14 and MNT1 and in inducing apoptotic cell death in all three cell lines. As revealed by flow cytometric and Northern blot analyses, quercetin and tamoxifen reduced heat shock protein-70 expression at both protein and mRNA levels.

To date, little is known about its role in the CNS, and in particular in the cross-talk between glia and neurons. We have first analyzed the properties of CCE of astrocytes in culture, in comparison with that of the rat basophilic leukemia cell line (RBL-2H3), a model where calcium release-activated Ca2+ (CRAC) channels have been unambiguously correlated with CCE. We here show that (i) in astrocytes CCE activated by store depletion and Ca2+ influx induced by glutamate share the same pharmacological profile of CCE in RBL-2H3 cells and (ii) glutamate-induced Ca2+ influx in astrocytes plays a primary role in glutamate-dependent intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) oscillations, being these latter reduced in frequency and amplitude by micromolar concentrations of La3+. Finally, we compared the expression of various mammalian transient receptor potential genes (TRP) in astrocytes and RBL-2H3 cells. Despite the similar pharmacological properties of CCE in these cells, the pattern of TRP expression is very different.

The bacterial expression of the MBP/gp21 chimeras resulted in soluble trimers containing intramonomer disulfide bonds. Detergents blocked the proteolytic cleavage of fusion peptide residues in the MBP/gp21-(313-425) chimera, indicating that the fusion peptide is available for interaction with detergent despite the presence of an N-terminal MBP domain. Limited proteolysis experiments indicated that the transmembrane domain proximal sequence Thr(425)-Ala(439) protects fusion peptide residues from chymotrypsin. MBP/gp21 chimera stability therefore depends on a functional interaction between N-terminal and transmembrane domain proximal regions in a gp21 helical hairpin structure. In addition, thermal aggregation experiments indicated that the Thr(425)-Ser(436) sequence confers stability to the fusion peptide-containing MBP/gp21 chimeras. The functional role of the transmembrane domain proximal sequence was assessed by alanine-scanning mutagenesis of the full-length envelope glycoprotein, with 11 of 12 single alanine substitutions resulting in 1.5- to 4.5-fold enhancements in cell-cell fusion activity. By contrast, single alanine substitutions in MBP/gp21 did not significantly alter chimera stability, indicating that multiple residues within the transmembrane domain proximal region and the fusion peptide and adjacent glycine-rich segment contribute to stability, thereby mitigating the potential effects of the substitutions. The fusion-enhancing effects of the substitutions are therefore likely to be caused by alteration of the prefusion complex. Our observations suggest that the function of the transmembrane domain proximal sequence in the prefusion envelope glycoprotein is distinct from its role in stabilizing the fusion peptide region in the fusion-activated helical hairpin conformation of gp21.","['Wilson, K A', 'Maerz, A L', 'Poumbourios, P']","['Wilson KA', 'Maerz AL', 'Poumbourios P']","[""St. Vincent's Institute of Medical Research, Fitzroy, Victoria 3065 Australia.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Deltaretrovirus Antigens)', '0 (Detergents)', '0 (Disulfides)', '0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (Maltose-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '0 (env Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus)', '0 (gp21 protein, Human T-lymphotropic virus 1)', 'EC 3.4.21.1 (Chymotrypsin)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Carrier Proteins/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Chromatography, Gel', 'Chymotrypsin/metabolism', 'Deltaretrovirus Antigens/genetics/*metabolism', 'Detergents/chemistry', 'Disulfides/chemistry', 'Gene Products, env/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Maltose-Binding Proteins', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Protein Structure, Secondary', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/chemistry/metabolism', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Temperature', 'env Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus']",2001/10/12 10:00,2002/02/01 10:01,['2001/10/12 10:00'],"['2001/10/12 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/02/01 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/12 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M108449200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(20)88195-2 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2001 Dec 28;276(52):49466-75. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M108449200.

To determine the clinical significance of multidrug resistance protein (MRP) 1 in ATL, we studied MRP1 expression and its association with clinical outcome. The expression of MRP1 mRNA in leukemia cells from 48 ATL patients was studied by slot blot analysis. The expression level of MRP1 mRNA in chronic-type ATL was significantly higher than that in lymphoma-type ATL (P = 0.033). There was no correlation between MRP1 expression and age, gender, WBC count, LDH, hypercalcemia, blood urea nitrogen, or performance status. However, the expression of MRP1 mRNA correlated only with peripheral blood abnormal lymphocyte counts (P = 0.008). The transporting activity of MRP1 was assessed using membrane vesicles. Membrane vesicles prepared from ATL cells with high expression of MRP1 mRNA showed a higher ATP-dependent leukotriene C(4) uptake than did those with low expression of MRP1 mRNA. This uptake was almost completely inhibited by LTD(4) antagonists ONO-1078 and MK571. In acute- and lymphoma-type ATL, high expression of MRP1 mRNA at diagnosis correlated with shorter survival, and Cox regression analysis revealed that MRP1 expression was an independent prognostic factor. These findings suggest that functionally active MRP1 is expressed in some ATL cells and that it is involved in drug resistance and has a possible causal relationship with poor prognosis in ATL. Multidrug resistance-reversing agents, such as ONO-1078 and MK571, that directly interact and inhibit the transporting activity of MRP1 may be useful for treating ATL patients.","['Ohno, N', 'Tani, A', 'Chen, Z S', 'Uozumi, K', 'Hanada, S', 'Akiba, S', 'Ren, X Q', 'Furukawa, T', 'Sumizawa, T', 'Arima, T', 'Akiyama, S I']","['Ohno N', 'Tani A', 'Chen ZS', 'Uozumi K', 'Hanada S', 'Akiba S', 'Ren XQ', 'Furukawa T', 'Sumizawa T', 'Arima T', 'Akiyama SI']","['Department of Cancer Chemotherapy, Second Department of Internal Medicine, Kagoshima University, Sakura-gaoka 8-35-1, Kagoshima 890-8520, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '10028-17-8 (Tritium)', '2CU6TT9V48 (Leukotriene C4)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*genetics/metabolism', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Leukotriene C4/pharmacokinetics', 'Male', 'Membranes/metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Survival Analysis', 'Tritium', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vincristine/metabolism']",2001/10/12 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/10/12 10:00'],"['2001/10/12 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/12 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2001 Oct;7(10):3120-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In mammals, two genes, SPEC1 and SPEC2, encode proteins of 79 and 84 amino acid residues, respectively. Here we report the expression and genomic organization of the human SPEC1 gene. Using Northern blot analysis, three major SPEC1 mRNA transcripts of 1.6, 3.3, and 6.3 kb were detected. Identification and sequencing of different sized SPEC1 cDNA clones revealed that the transcript size heterogeneity was due to alternative splicing in the 3'-untranslated region. In addition, a distinct SPEC1 splice variant from within the coding sequence, SPEC1-beta, was identified and detected in a variety of human tissues. Analysis of the genomic organization of SPEC1 revealed that the coding sequence of the SPEC1 isoform was derived from exons 2, 3 and 4, while the SPEC1-beta isoform was derived from exon 2 and a read-through event of intron 2. Examination of the 5'-end of the SPEC1 genomic sequence revealed that AF1q, a previously identified gene involved in translocations with the MLL (mixed-lineage leukemia) gene, was 631 bp away in a head-to-head orientation. This intergenic sequence containing the putative promoter region for both SPEC1 and AF1q genes did not contain a TATA box or CAAT box. Transfection experiments using an AF1q promoter luciferase reporter construct in a variety of cells including Cos1 cells, Jurkat T-cells, MCF-7 breast cancer cells, and NIH-3T3 fibroblasts showed no promoter activity. In contrast, a SPEC1 promoter luciferase reporter construct showed high levels of reporter activity in Cos1 and MCF-7 cells, low activity in NIH-3T3 fibroblasts and no activity in Jurkat T-cells. These promoter analyses suggest that although SPEC1 and AF1q genes share the same promoter region, they are not coordinately regulated.","['Pirone, D M', 'Oberst, M D', 'Stylianou, D', 'Burbelo, P D']","['Pirone DM', 'Oberst MD', 'Stylianou D', 'Burbelo PD']","['Lombardi Cancer Center and the Department of Oncology, Georgetown University Medical Center, Washington, DC 20007, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Gene,Gene,7706761,"['0 (Blood Proteins)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (DNA, Intergenic)', '0 (MLLT11 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (cdc42 GTP-Binding Protein)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', '*Alternative Splicing', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Blood Proteins/*genetics', 'Blotting, Northern', 'COS Cells', 'DNA/chemistry/genetics', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'DNA, Intergenic/genetics', 'Exons', 'Female', 'Gene Order', 'Genes/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Introns', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Luciferases/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Tissue Distribution', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'cdc42 GTP-Binding Protein/*genetics']",2001/10/12 10:00,2001/10/26 10:01,['2001/10/12 10:00'],"['2001/10/12 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/26 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/12 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0378111901005613 [pii]', '10.1016/s0378-1119(01)00561-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Gene. 2001 Aug 8;273(2):295-303. doi: 10.1016/s0378-1119(01)00561-3.,,,,,,,,,['GENBANK/AY026491'],,,,,,,,,,,

Approximately 10% of all Wilms' tumors carry mutations in the WT1 gene. Alterations in the WT1 gene have also been observed in other tumor types, such as leukemia, mesothelioma and desmoplastic small round cell tumor. Dependent on the tumor type, WT1 proteins might either function as tumor suppressor proteins or as survival factors. Mutations in the WT1 gene can also result in congenital abnormalities as observed in Denys-Drash and Frasier syndrome patients. Mouse models have proven the critical importance of WT1 expression for the development of several organs, including the kidneys, the gonads and the spleen. The WT1 proteins seem to perform two main functions. They regulate the transcription of a variety of target genes and may be involved in post-transcriptional processing of RNA. The WT1 gene encodes at least 24 protein forms. These isoforms have partially distinct biological functions and effects, which in many cases are also specific for the model system in which WT1 is studied. This review discusses the molecular mechanisms by which the various WT1 isoforms exert their functions in normal development and how alterations in WT1 may lead to developmental abnormalities and tumor growth.","['Scharnhorst, V', 'van der Eb, A J', 'Jochemsen, A G']","['Scharnhorst V', 'van der Eb AJ', 'Jochemsen AG']","['Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology and Center for Biomedical Genetics, Leiden University Medical Center, Wassenaarseweg 72, 2333 AL, The, Leiden, Netherlands.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,Gene,Gene,7706761,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics/physiology', 'WT1 Proteins']",2001/10/12 10:00,2001/10/26 10:01,['2001/10/12 10:00'],"['2001/10/12 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/26 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/12 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0378111901005935 [pii]', '10.1016/s0378-1119(01)00593-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Gene. 2001 Aug 8;273(2):141-61. doi: 10.1016/s0378-1119(01)00593-5.,,209,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The role of pericryptal fibroblasts in this microenvironment has been the subject of considerable speculation. This study examined the expression of growth factors and their receptors by colonic crypt epithelium and pericryptal fibroblasts. METHODS AND RESULTS: Pericryptal fibroblast cells were isolated and cultured from decrypted human colonic mucosa. The pericryptal fibroblast cells expressed messenger RNA (mRNA) for interleukin-6 (IL-6), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), LIF receptor alpha, and the common coreceptor glycoprotein 130 (GP130), but not the IL-6 receptor alpha. Interleukin-6 protein expression was confirmed by the analysis of conditioned medium and immunohistochemistry. In comparison, normal colonic epithelial cells express mRNA for LIF but not IL-6 as well as the receptors for GP-130, IL-6 receptor alpha but not LIF receptor alpha. As cultures of normal human colonic epithelial cells were not available, the conditioned medium was assayed from established colon carcinoma cell lines and demonstrated a secretion of LIF but not IL-6 protein. CONCLUSION: The expression of reciprocal cytokine and receptor expression suggest that there is a paracrine relationship between pericryptal fibroblasts and colonic epithelium.","['Rockman, S P', 'Demmler, K', 'Roczo, N', 'Cosgriff, A', 'Phillips, W A', 'Thomas, R J', 'Whitehead, R H']","['Rockman SP', 'Demmler K', 'Roczo N', 'Cosgriff A', 'Phillips WA', 'Thomas RJ', 'Whitehead RH']","['Division of Surgical Oncology, Peter MacCallum Cancer Institute, East Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. s.rockman@pmci.unimelb.edu.au']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Australia,J Gastroenterol Hepatol,Journal of gastroenterology and hepatology,8607909,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (IL6ST protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (LIFR protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-6)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/genetics', 'Colon/*metabolism', 'Colonic Neoplasms', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130', 'Fibroblasts/metabolism', 'Growth Inhibitors/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/*genetics', 'Intestinal Mucosa/*metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit', 'Lymphokines/*genetics', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/*genetics', 'Receptors, Cytokine/*genetics', 'Receptors, Interleukin-6/*genetics', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF', 'Reference Values', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/metabolism']",2001/10/12 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/10/12 10:00'],"['2001/10/12 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/12 10:00 [entrez]']","['jgh2588 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1440-1746.2001.02588.x [doi]']",ppublish,J Gastroenterol Hepatol. 2001 Sep;16(9):991-1000. doi: 10.1046/j.1440-1746.2001.02588.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most patients with CTCL are negative for antibodies to the structural proteins of HTLV-I, and thus a causative role for this virus is usually dismissed. However, the Tax sequence of HTLV-I has been found in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of practically all patients with CTCL. Such patients express Tax mRNA and have antibodies to p40Tax, the protein encoded by this sequence. Sequence analysis of a 159-bp region of Tax extracted from CTCL cells proved to be homologous with the same region prepared from a cell line infected with prototypic HTLV-I. By in situ PCR, Tax has been demonstrated in the lymphocytes infiltrating the skin as well as in the keratinocytes of such patients. Apart from the pathophysiologic and clinical interest of these studies, these observations may have therapeutic implications. In vitro, the proliferation of HTLV-I-transformed cells can be inhibited by antisense to HTLV-I Tax. Since Tax has not been identified in the normal human genome, antisense to Tax deserves serious consideration as a treatment modality for patients whose cells have been demonstrated to harborTax.","['Zucker-Franklin, D']",['Zucker-Franklin D'],"['Department of Medicine, New York University School of Medicine, New York 10016, USA.

Overall, the data suggest that pentostatin has significant antitumor activity in these patients, with response rates ranging from 33% to over 70%. Approximately one-third of the responses are complete. The most common side effects include granulocytopenia, nausea, and renal insufficiency. CD4 suppression occurs and may result in an increased risk of herpes zoster infection. Although prolonged remissions have been seen, most responses are short-lived.

The varied cutaneous clinical presentations, dependent on the specific features of the dominant subclones of the malignant lymphocytes, historically led to confusing descriptive terms (mycosis fungoides, Sezary syndrome, lymphoma cutis, leukemia cutis, reticulum cell sarcoma of the skin). Recognition that all of these clinical presentations are cancers of a single type of cell has permitted their unification under the single, clarified heading cutaneous T cell lymphoma, or CTCL. As a neoplastic amplification of the skin-homing T cells from which it is derived, CTCL's distinctive features can be explained. The triad of skin localization, remarkable avoidance of bone marrow, often even in the context of extremely high leukemic counts, and infiltration of perifollicular T cell zones of the lymph nodes and spleen reflect the migratory pathway and homing patterns of cutaneous T cells. The usually retained levels of serum immunoglobulins and the resulting capacity to defend against encapsulated bacteria, often even in advanced CTCL, are manifestations of the helper function of the malignant T cells-that is, their functional capacity to stimulate B lymphocytes to produce immunoglobulin in a polyclonal manner. In contrast, the often-extreme normal T cell deficits in advanced CTCL, equivalent to those of late-stage AIDS, probably resulting from the production of suppressive cytokines such as IL-10, cause susceptibility to a broad range of opportunistic infections, the most common direct cause of death. Pautrier microabscesses, the pathognomonic feature of epidermotropic early CTCL, hold the clues to the pathogenesis of the cancer. These intraepidermal collections of stimulated and proliferating malignant cells, adherent to the dendrites of intraepidermal dendritic antigen-presenting cells (Langerhans' cells [LCs]), indicate a dynamic communication between the two cell types. Since CTCL cells are derived from CD4 T cells, which normally receive signaling from dendritic cells (DCs) via presentation of antigenic peptides as part of class II major histocompatibility complexes to antigen-specific T cell receptors (TCRs), it seems likely that CTCL is a clonal proliferation of T cells responding to specific antigenic stimulation from LCs. This is supported by our recent finding that CTCL cells proliferate in vitro in response to TCR stimulation by autologous DCs, which have previously ingested and processed antigens from apoptotic autologous CTCL cells. In short, CTCL may be a malignancy of T cells stimulated to proliferate against its own tumor antigens. The most intriguing possibility is that a yet-unidentified transforming retrovirus, harbored by LCs, simultaneously attracts, stimulates, and transforms a single clone of antigen-specific cutaneous T cells. Longstanding disease-free remissions have been induced by transimmunization (via a photopheresis apparatus). This treatment, introduced more than a decade ago by our group and the first and still the only FDA-approved selective anticancer immunotherapy, has been performed more than 200,000 times worldwide on advanced CTCL, as well as in reversal/prevention of heart transplant rejection and treatment of graft-versus-host disease and selected autoimmune disorders. Transimmunization induces clinically relevant suppression, and occasionally elimination, of pathogenic T cell clones. The common denominator between these diverse groups of responding patients is the presence of clonally distinctive TCRs on the disease-causing malignant or autoaggressive T cell clones. In CTCL at least one source of tumor-specific antigens is derived from the clone-specific (idiotypic) segments of the TCR protein chains. In the photopheresis apparatus, two synergistic phenomena are initiated: induction of apoptosis of the CTCL cells and mass conversion of blood monocytes to DCs. The young DCs then ingest the apoptotic CTCL cells, process and present the CTCL antigens to responding anti-CTCL cytotoxic T cells, and stimulate clinically important CTCL suppression. Now that it is better understood, transimmunization may have much broader applications in other types of cancer as well.","['Edelson, R L']",['Edelson RL'],"['Yale University Comprehensive Cancer Center and Department of Dermatology, New Haven, Connecticut 06520, USA. richard.edelson@yale.edu']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Ann N Y Acad Sci,Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,7506858,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Antigen Presentation', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/immunology', 'Cell Division', 'Clone Cells', 'Dendritic Cells/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell, Cutaneous/immunology/pathology/*therapy', 'Models, Immunological', 'Photopheresis', 'Skin Neoplasms/immunology/pathology/*therapy', 'Terminology as Topic']",2001/10/12 10:00,2001/11/03 10:01,['2001/10/12 10:00'],"['2001/10/12 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/11/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/12 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Ann N Y Acad Sci. 2001 Sep;941:1-11.,,28,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A younger age (<40 years of age), platelet count >30 x 10(9)/L, having L1 morphology (French-American-British [FAB]classification subtype), female sex, and the absence of chromosomal abnormalities also helped improve survival rate. According to multivariate analysis, presence of Ph chromosome was found to be a major influencing factor for OS. Although higher doses of L-asp were administered than those used in previous studies, the adverse effect of L-asp was rarely identified. Therefore, it should be considered one of the key drugs for treatment of adult ALL.

METHODS: A total of 13 B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients were studied. Exposure of leukemic lymphocytes with (n = 8) or without (n = 5) P2Z receptors to ATP, benzoylbenzoic-ATP (BzATP), 2-methylthio-ATP (2MeSATP), adenosine-5' [gamma-thio] triphosphate (ATP-gamma S), and other nucleosides for 8 h in vitro. Apoptosis was detected by electron microscopy (EM), agarose gel electrophoresis, and the quantitative assay-TdT assay. RESULTS: Apoptosis was detected only in leukemic lymphocytes with P2Z receptors. Using a quantitative assay, ATP-induced DNA strand breaks were found to occur specifically with BzATP, ATP and 2MeSATP, but not for analogue ATP-gamma S nor other nucleosides. Meanwhile, ATP-induced DNA fragmentation was fully blocked by pretreatment with oxidized ATP (OxATP), a compound recently shown to block P2Z receptors. Also, it is shown that the Ca2+/calmodulin complex plays a role in the regulation of the apoptosis induced by ATP on CLL cells, because an antagonist of this complex, 1-[N, O-bis (5-isoquinolinesulfonyl)-N-methyl-L-tyrosyl]-4-phenylpiperazine (KN-62) was found to inhibit the ATP-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, choline, an inhibitor of phospholipase D (PLD), is first shown to partially inhibit ATP-induced apoptosis. CONCLUSION: These data indicate that P2Z receptors on lymphocytes play an important role in the apoptosis induced by ATP in vitro.","['Peng, L', 'Bradley, C J', 'Wiley, J S']","['Peng L', 'Bradley CJ', 'Wiley JS']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, First Hospital, West China University of Medical Sciences, Chengdu 610041, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Chin Med J (Engl),Chinese medical journal,7513795,"['0 (P2RX7 protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Purinergic P2)', '0 (Receptors, Purinergic P2X7)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Separation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/metabolism/*pathology', 'Lymphocytes/*pathology', 'Receptors, Purinergic P2/*physiology', 'Receptors, Purinergic P2X7']",2001/10/12 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/10/12 10:00'],"['2001/10/12 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/12 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Chin Med J (Engl). 1999 Apr;112(4):356-62.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: NB4 and APL cells were cultured in presence of ATRA, BA and TB respectively either as a single agent or in combinations at various concentration ratio. Cell growth was measured and myeloid differentiation was determined by morphology and the percentage of positive nitroblue tetrazolium reduction (NBT) on consecutive days over the whole process of culture. RESULTS: NB4 cells can be induced by ATRA alone and synergistically induced by the combinations of BA or TB with ATRA to differentiate. The synergy was reflected by a remarkable decrease in the effective concentration of ATRA required in the combinations in comparison with it as a sole agent. The combinations also shortened the time for the cells to reach the same level of maturation as that needed for ATRA alone. The potentiation on ATRA-induced differentiation of NB4 cells seemed depending on an appropriate concentration ratio of each inducer in the combinations and the time of action. A preliminary result of in vitro induction of primarily cultured leukemic cells from APL patients by the combined inducers was promising. CONCLUSION: The combinations of ATRA with BA or TB at an appropriate ratio may improve the clinical outcome of differentiation therapy for APL patients.","['Chen, Z', 'Wang, W', 'Pan, J', 'Chen, L', 'Xue, Y']","['Chen Z', 'Wang W', 'Pan J', 'Chen L', 'Xue Y']","['Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital, Suzhou Medical College, Suzhou 215006, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],China,Chin Med J (Engl),Chinese medical journal,7513795,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Prodrugs)', '0 (Triglycerides)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '107-92-6 (Butyric Acid)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'S05LZ624MF (tributyrin)']",IM,"['Butyric Acid/*pharmacology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/genetics/*pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/metabolism', 'Prodrugs/*pharmacology', 'Stereoisomerism', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Triglycerides/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/10/12 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/10/12 10:00'],"['2001/10/12 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/12 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Chin Med J (Engl). 1999 Apr;112(4):352-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At the same time, HTLV-I provirus DNA of ATLL patients were also compared with 18 cases of cutaneous lymphoma (CL), two cases of actinic reticuloid as well as two cases of lymphocytic infiltration. METHODS: Immunohistochemistry studies were carried out on the infiltrating cells using monoclonal antibodies against CD45-RO, CD20, CD68 on paraffin-embedded sections by ABC method and using monoclonal antibodies against CD3, CD4 and CD8 with indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) on frozen sections. Skin biopsies were examined by electron microscope. Serum and bone marrow cells were tested for antibodies against HTLV-I-associated antigen by IIF, and HTLV-I provirus DNA was examined by PCR method. RESULTS: The research showed four patients with ATLL manifesting cutaneous lesions, were subsequently found with additional systemic symptoms, as extensively enlarged superficial lymph node, abnormal increased IL-2 receptor, flower-like cells in their peripheral blood and marrow. The HTLV-I provirus DNA was positive in the peripheral blood, bone marrow, cutaneous lesions and lymph node biopsy specimens by using PCR amplification of specific HTLV-I fragment while 18 cases of the CL were negative for HTLV-I. The special ultrastructure of skin lesions was also found in ATLL patients. CONCLUSIONS: The cutaneous involvement in ATLL is a type of cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL) but shows some differential immunological markers for differential diagnosis. The examination of HTLV-I antibodies or HTLV-I provirus DNA is necessary for diagnosis of ATLL. The ultrastructural characteristics in skin lesions of ATLL were of atypical lymphocytes and mononuclear cells invading the epidermis, and the mononuclear cells are possessing the phagocytic function and phagocytizing the degenerated epidermic cells or lymphocytes.","['Wang, C', 'Yao, Z', 'Liao, J', 'Luo, Y', 'Ma, Y', 'Chen, G', 'Zhu, W']","['Wang C', 'Yao Z', 'Liao J', 'Luo Y', 'Ma Y', 'Chen G', 'Zhu W']","['Department of Dermatology, China-Japan Friendship Hospital, Beijing 100029, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],China,Chin Med J (Engl),Chinese medical journal,7513795,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (HTLV-I Antibodies)']",IM,"['Aged', 'DNA, Viral/*analysis', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'HTLV-I Antibodies/immunology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/immunology/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell, Cutaneous/immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Skin/*ultrastructure']",2001/10/12 10:00,2001/11/03 10:01,['2001/10/12 10:00'],"['2001/10/12 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/11/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/12 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Chin Med J (Engl). 1999 May;112(5):461-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We reported recently that this transcription factor promotes proliferation by directly transactivating c-myc and inhibits cell death through its up-regulation of Bcl-2 (Schmidt et al., 2000). To understand more about how these cells become transformed we looked at how they deal with cellular pathways inducing growth arrest. Specifically, we were interested in the expression of the tumor suppressor gene Cdkn2b (p15(INK4b)) in MML because this gene is expressed during myeloid differentiation and its inactivation by methylation has been shown to be important for the development of human acute myeloid leukemia. mRNA levels for p15(INK4b) and another INK4 gene p16(INK4a) were examined in monocytic Myb tumors and were compared with expression of the same genes in c-myc transformed monocytic tumors that do not express c-Myb. The Cdkn2a (p16(INK4a)) gene was generally not expressed in either tumor type, an observation explained by methylation or deletion in the promoter region. Although Cdkn2b (p15(INK4b)) mRNA was expressed in the Myc tumors, many transcripts were aberrant in size and contained only exon 1. Surprisingly, in the majority of the Myb tumors there was no p15(INK4b) transcription and neither deletion nor methylation could explain this result. Additional experiments demonstrated that, in the presence of constitutive c-Myb expression, the induction of p15(INK4b) mRNA that accompanies differentiation of M1 cells to monocytes does not occur. Therefore, the transcriptional regulator c-Myb appears to prevent activation of a growth arrest pathway that normally accompanies monocyte maturation.","['Schmidt, M', 'Koller, R', 'Haviernik, P', 'Bies, J', 'Maciag, K', 'Wolff, L']","['Schmidt M', 'Koller R', 'Haviernik P', 'Bies J', 'Maciag K', 'Wolff L']","['Laboratory of Cellular Oncology, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cdkn2b protein, mouse)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Western', 'Carrier Proteins/*metabolism', '*Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cell Differentiation', 'CpG Islands', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15', '*Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16', 'DNA, Complementary/metabolism', 'Exons', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genes, myc/genetics', 'Interleukin-6/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Models, Genetic', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', '*Tumor Suppressor Proteins', '*Up-Regulation']",2001/10/11 10:00,2001/11/03 10:01,['2001/10/11 10:00'],"['2000/11/07 00:00 [received]', '2001/07/05 00:00 [revised]', '2001/07/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2001/10/11 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/11/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/11 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1204821 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 2001 Sep 27;20(43):6205-14. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1204821.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we describe the genomic and transcriptional organization of this gene, detailing seventeen exons distributed over 240 kb of sequence. Extensive database analyses identified orthologous rodent cDNAs that corresponded to new, unidentified 5' splice variants of the Ov/Br septin gene, increasing the total number of such variants to six. We report that splicing events, occurring at non-canonical sites within the body of the 3' terminal exon, remove either 1801 bp or 1849 bp of non-coding sequence and facilitate access to a secondary open reading frame of 44 amino acids maintained near the end of the 3' UTR. These events constitute a novel coding arrangement and represent the first report of such a design being implemented by a eukaryotic gene. The various Ov/Br proteins either differ minimally at their amino and carboxy termini or are equivalent to truncated versions of larger isoforms. Northern analysis with an Ov/Br septin 3' UTR probe reveals three transcripts of 4.4, 4 and 3 kb, the latter being restricted to a sub-set of the tissues tested.

This study demonstrates that the anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1 and IL-6 was concomitantly expressed in human cervical cancer tissues and cell lines, but not in normal cervix tissues. Upon IL-6 treatment, Mcl-1, but not other Bcl-2 family members, was rapidly up-regulated peaking at 4-8 h in human cervical cancer C33A cells. Supporting this observation, using anti-IL-6 or anti-IL-6 receptor antibody to interrupt the IL-6 autocrine loop in SiHa cells significantly reduced cellular level of Mcl-1. This study hypothesizes that the expression of Mcl-1 in cervical cancer cells is regulated by IL-6. The matter of which signaling pathways transduced by IL-6 is responsible for the Mcl-1 up-regulation is further investigated herein. Blocking the STAT3 or MAPK pathway with dominant-negative mutant STAT3F or the MEK inhibitor PD98059 failed to inhibit IL-6-mediated Mcl-1 expression. Meanwhile, the IL-6-induced Mcl-1 up-regulation was effectively abolished by treatment with PI 3-K inhibitors, LY294002. Additionally, overexpression of dominant-negative (dn) Akt in C33A cells could inhibit the IL-6-induced increase of Mcl-1. Finally, overexpression of IL-6 in C33A cells caused a markable resistance to apoptosis induced by doxorubicin or cisplatin. Transient transfection of IL-6-overexpressed cells with a mcl-1 antisense vector, leading to the attenuation of their apoptosis-resistant activity. In conclusion, the data herein suggest that IL-6 regulated the mcl-1 expression via a PI 3-K/Akt-dependent pathway that may facilitate the oncogenesis of human cervical cancer by modulating the apoptosis threshold.","['Wei, L H', 'Kuo, M L', 'Chen, C A', 'Chou, C H', 'Cheng, W F', 'Chang, M C', 'Su, J L', 'Hsieh, C Y']","['Wei LH', 'Kuo ML', 'Chen CA', 'Chou CH', 'Cheng WF', 'Chang MC', 'Su JL', 'Hsieh CY']","['Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, National Taiwan University Hospital, No. 7 Chung-Shan South Road, Taipei, Taiwan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (AKT1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/metabolism/*physiopathology', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/metabolism/*physiology', 'Luminescent Proteins/metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism/*physiology', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*metabolism', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Up-Regulation', 'Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/metabolism/*physiopathology']",2001/10/11 10:00,2001/11/03 10:01,['2001/10/11 10:00'],"['2000/12/15 00:00 [received]', '2001/06/05 00:00 [revised]', '2001/06/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2001/10/11 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/11/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/11 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1204733 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 2001 Sep 13;20(41):5799-809. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1204733.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Vectors displaying an EGF polypeptide were fully infectious on EGF receptor-negative cells, but were inactive on cells with abundant EGF receptors (inverse targeting). Receptor-mediated inactivation of gene transfer was overcome by competing the EGF receptors on the target cells with soluble EGF or by removing the displayed EGF domain from the surface of the vector particles by factor Xa cleavage of a specific protease substrate engineered into its tethering linker (protease targeting). Intravenous infusion of nontargeted HIV-1 vectors led to maximal luciferase activity in liver and spleen with moderate or minimal activity in heart, skeletal muscle, lung, brain, kidney, ovaries and bone marrow. In contrast, intravenous EGF-displaying vectors were expressed maximally in spleen with very low level luciferase expression detectable in liver (EGF-receptor rich).

In the present study, as the first objective we showed that the CD gene can also render drug resistance in BMCs to related analogs, 2',2'-difluorodeoxycytidine (dFdC) and 5-azadeoxycytidine (5-AZA-CdR). As a second objective, we investigated the potential of ex vivo selection with cytosine nucleoside analogs of CD-transduced BMC. The goal of this approach was to enrich the fraction of CD-transduced BMCs so as to increase the transgene expression and level of drug resistance before transplantation. This strategy may have the potential to circumvent the problem in clinical gene therapy of low level of gene transfer and adequate long-term gene expression. Using a bicistronic retroviral vector containing the CD and the green fluorescent protein (CDiGFP), we transduced murine L1210 leukemic cells. All three analogs, ARA-C, dFdC, and 5-AZA-CdR were demonstrated in vitro to enrich (>95%) the population of leukemic cells expressing the GFP transgene. However, with CD-transduced primary murine BMCs cultivated at high cell density we observed that in vitro selection with ARA-C was not possible due to release of CD into the culture medium at amounts that were sufficient to inactivate the analog. The CD-containing medium produced a chemoprotective effect on mock BMCs as shown by lack of significant growth inhibition in the presence of ARA-C. However, at low cell density in a cell mixture containing CD-transduced cells, the mock BMCs showed marked drug sensitivity to ARA-C as determined by clonogenic assay. Selection with ARA-C was shown to significantly increase the CD enzyme activity in transduced BMC. These results suggest that CD gene has the potential to be a good selectable marker and a possible tool for chemoprotection in cancer gene therapy.","['Beausejour, C M', 'Eliopoulos, N', 'Momparler, L', 'Le, N L', 'Momparler, R L']","['Beausejour CM', 'Eliopoulos N', 'Momparler L', 'Le NL', 'Momparler RL']","['Departement de pharmacologie, Universite de Montreal, Centre de recherche pediatrique, Hopital Ste-Justine, 3175 Cote Ste-Catherine, Montreal, Quebec, Canada H3T 1C5.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cancer Gene Ther,Cancer gene therapy,9432230,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '0W860991D6 (Deoxycytidine)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (DNA Modification Methylases)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (Cytidine Deaminase)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Azacitidine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/drug effects/*enzymology', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Cytarabine/*pharmacology', 'Cytidine Deaminase/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics', 'DNA Modification Methylases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Decitabine', 'Deoxycytidine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Drug Evaluation', 'Drug Resistance/genetics', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Luminescent Proteins/metabolism', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'Transgenes']",2001/10/11 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/10/11 10:00'],"['2001/05/30 00:00 [received]', '2001/10/11 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/11 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.cgt.7700358 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Gene Ther. 2001 Sep;8(9):669-76. doi: 10.1038/sj.cgt.7700358.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hence, there is a tremendous need for development of new and effective therapy for this tumor. In an earlier study we reported a potent antitumor activity of Auristatin PE (AuriPE) against pancreatic tumor. In addition, we have also reported that bryostatin 1 (bryo1) induces differentiation of leukemia cells, but the effect of bryo1 has not been investigated in pancreatic tumors. This is the first report where we demonstrate that bryo1 induces differentiation and potentiates the antitumor effect of AuriPE in a human pancreatic tumor (PANC-1) xenograft model. A xenograft model was established by injecting the PANC-1 cells s.c. in severe combined immune deficient (SCID) mice. After development of the s.c. tumors, tumors were dissected and small fragments were transplanted in vivo to new SCID mice, with a success rate of 100% and a doubling time of 4.8 days. The SCID mouse xenograft model was used to test the in vivo differentiation effect of bryo1 and its efficacy when given alone or in combination with AuriPE. Sections from paraffin-embedded tumors excised from untreated (control) SCID mice revealed typical poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. Interestingly, sections of s.c. tumors taken from bryo1-treated mice revealed carcinomas that were much lower grade and less aggressive, and displayed prominent squamous and glandular differentiation. In this study, the tumor growth inhibition (T/C), activity score and cure rate for bryo1, AuriPE and bryo1+AuriPE were 80%, (+) and 0/4; 0.0%, (++++) and 3/5; and 0.0%, (++++) and 3/4, respectively. Mice treated with either AuriPE or bryo1+AuriPE were free of tumors for more than 150 days and were considered cured. The use of bryo1 as a novel differentiating agent and its combination with AuriPE should be further explored for the treatment of adenocarcinoma of the pancreas.","['Mohammad, R M', 'Adsay, N V', 'Philip, P A', 'Pettit, G R', 'Vaitkevicius, V K', 'Sarkar, F H']","['Mohammad RM', 'Adsay NV', 'Philip PA', 'Pettit GR', 'Vaitkevicius VK', 'Sarkar FH']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, Ml 48201, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Anticancer Drugs,Anti-cancer drugs,9100823,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Bryostatins)', '0 (Lactones)', '0 (Macrolides)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '37O2X55Y9E (bryostatin 1)', 'DQC51A0WQH (soblidotin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Bryostatins', 'Drug Synergism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lactones/*pharmacology', 'Macrolides', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Oligopeptides/*pharmacology', 'Pancreatic Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2001/10/11 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/10/11 10:00'],"['2001/10/11 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/11 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00001813-200110000-00005 [doi]'],ppublish,Anticancer Drugs. 2001 Oct;12(9):735-40. doi: 10.1097/00001813-200110000-00005.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The relative contributions of polymerase-dependent and polymerase-independent RNase H activities during reverse transcription and template switching in vivo have not been determined. We developed an in vivo trans-complementation assay in which direct repeat deletion through template switching reconstitutes a functional green fluorescent protein gene in a retroviral vector. Complementation in trans between murine leukemia virus Gag-Pol proteins lacking polymerase and RNase H activities restored viral replication. Because only polymerase-independent RNase H activity is present in this cell line, the relative roles of polymerase-dependent and -independent RNase H activities in template switching could be determined. We also analyzed double mutants possessing polymerase and RNase H mutations that increased and decreased template switching, respectively. The double mutants exhibited low template switching frequency, indicating that the RNase H mutations were dominant. Trans-complementation of the double mutants with polymerase-independent RNase H did not restore the high template switching frequency, indicating that polymerase-dependent RNase H activity was essential for the increased frequency of template switching. Additionally, trans-complementation of RNase H mutants in the presence and absence of hydroxyurea, which slows the rate of reverse transcription, showed that hydroxyurea increased template switching only when polymerase-dependent RNase H activity was present. This is, to our knowledge, the first demonstration of polymerase-dependent RNase H activity in vivo. These results provide strong evidence for a dynamic association between the rates of DNA polymerization and polymerase-dependent RNase H activity, which determines the frequency of in vivo template switching.","['Hwang, C K', 'Svarovskaia, E S', 'Pathak, V K']","['Hwang CK', 'Svarovskaia ES', 'Pathak VK']","['HIV Drug Resistance Program, National Cancer Institute, Frederick, MD 21702, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)', 'EC 3.1.26.4 (Ribonuclease H)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Hydroxyurea/pharmacology', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/drug effects/*enzymology/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mutagenesis', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/*genetics/metabolism', 'Ribonuclease H/*genetics/metabolism', 'Templates, Genetic']",2001/10/11 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/10/11 10:00'],"['2001/10/11 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/11 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1073/pnas.221289898 [doi]', '221289898 [pii]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2001 Oct 9;98(21):12209-14. doi: 10.1073/pnas.221289898.

We hypothesized that this is due to an interaction between the two drugs at the level of the platelet precursor. METHODS: We measured inhibition of growth of the megakaryoblast cell line MEG-01 following exposure to paclitaxel and carboplatin singly or combined. Drug interaction was assessed by median effect analysis. RESULTS: An antagonistic interaction was observed, and this was most marked at drug concentrations giving a low level of growth inhibition (P < 0.002, sign test). The interaction was not sequence-dependent. There was no significant difference in whole-cell accumulation of platinum or the amount of platinum adducts on DNA following combined treatment in comparison with carboplatin alone. CONCLUSIONS: These results provide the first evidence of an antagonistic interaction between paclitaxel and carboplatin in a platelet precursor and provide an explanation for the platelet-sparing effect of the combination of these chemotherapeutic agents. While the mechanisms underlying the interaction described in this report are yet to be fully elucidated, this study provides evidence that the antagonism between paclitaxel and carboplatin in MEG-01 cells is not due to reduced platination of DNA.","['Guminski, A D', 'Harnett, P R', 'deFazio, A']","['Guminski AD', 'Harnett PR', 'deFazio A']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Westmead Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, University of Sydney at Westmead Hospital, NSW, Australia. alexg@westgate.wh.usyd.edu.au']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (DNA Adducts)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', 'BG3F62OND5 (Carboplatin)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/pharmacology', 'Carboplatin/adverse effects/*pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'DNA Adducts/metabolism', 'DNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Antagonism', 'Drug Interactions', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/drug therapy', 'Paclitaxel/*pharmacology', 'Thrombocytopenia/chemically induced/*prevention & control', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*drug effects']",2001/10/11 10:00,2001/10/26 10:01,['2001/10/11 10:00'],"['2001/10/11 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/26 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/11 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s002800100279 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2001 Sep;48(3):229-34. doi: 10.1007/s002800100279.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A nested PCR was conducted with primers specific for a segment of the pol region of the BLV genome. RESULTS: Sensitivity and specificity of the ELISA were comparable to those of the RIP assay. Use of the ELISA on pooled milk samples allowed identification of herds in which prevalence of BLV infection among lactating cows was as low as 2.5%. Pooled milk samples from BLV-free herds did not react in the ELISA. All cattle that had positive results for the nested PCR had BLV antibodies, but cattle with consistantly low antibody titers required examination of sequential DNA samples to detect viral sequences. None of the 63 antibody-negative cattle had positive results for the PCR. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This ELISA is a highly specific and sensitive assay for the detection of BLV antibodies in serum and milk samples of cattle. Examination of pooled milk samples with the ELISA provides a reliable, practical, and economic procedure for identification of BLV-infected herds. The nested PCR also constitutes a specific procedure for direct diagnosis of infection with BLV.","['Gutierrez, S E', 'Dolcini, G L', 'Arroyo, G H', 'Rodriguez Dubra, C', 'Ferrer, J F', 'Esteban, E N']","['Gutierrez SE', 'Dolcini GL', 'Arroyo GH', 'Rodriguez Dubra C', 'Ferrer JF', 'Esteban EN']","['Departamento de Sanidad Animal y Medicina Preventiva, Facultad de Ciencias Veterinarias, Universidad Nacional del Centro de la Provincia de Buenos Aires, Tandil, Argentina.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Am J Vet Res,American journal of veterinary research,0375011,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/blood', 'Antigens, Viral/isolation & purification', 'Cattle', 'DNA, Viral/chemistry/isolation & purification', 'Enzootic Bovine Leukosis/blood/*diagnosis/virology', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay/methods/*veterinary', 'Female', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/chemistry/genetics/*isolation & purification', 'Milk/virology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*veterinary', 'ROC Curve', 'Radioimmunoprecipitation Assay/veterinary', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",2001/10/11 10:00,2002/03/28 10:01,['2001/10/11 10:00'],"['2001/10/11 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/11 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.2460/ajvr.2001.62.1571 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Vet Res. 2001 Oct;62(10):1571-7. doi: 10.2460/ajvr.2001.62.1571.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using an RIIalpha-deficient leukemic cell line (Reh) and stably transfected Reh cell clones expressing wild-type RIIalpha or an RIIalpha(T54E) mutant, we show that RIIalpha associates with chromatin-bound A-kinase anchoring protein AKAP95 at mitosis and that this interaction involves phosphorylation of RIIalpha on T54. During interphase, both RIIalpha and RIIalpha(T54E) exhibit a centrosome-Golgi localization, whereas AKAP95 is intranuclear. At mitosis and in a mitotic extract, most RIIalpha, but not RIIalpha(T54E), co-fractionates with chromatin, onto which it associates with AKAP95. This correlates with T54 phosphorylation of RIIalpha. Disrupting AKAP95-RIIalpha anchoring or depleting RIIalpha from the mitotic extract promotes premature chromatin decondensation. In a nuclear reconstitution assay that mimics mitotic nuclear reformation, RIIalpha is threonine dephosphorylated and dissociates from AKAP95 prior to assembly of nuclear membranes. Lastly, the Reh cell line exhibits premature chromatin decondensation in vitro, which can be rescued by addition of wild-type RIIalpha or an RIIalpha(T54D) mutant, but not RIIalpha(T54E, A, L or V) mutants. Our results suggest that CDK1-mediated T54 phosphorylation of RIIalpha constitutes a molecular switch controlling anchoring of RIIalpha to chromatin-bound AKAP95, where the PKA-AKAP95 complex participates in remodeling chromatin during mitosis.","['Landsverk, H B', 'Carlson, C R', 'Steen, R L', 'Vossebein, L', 'Herberg, F W', 'Tasken, K', 'Collas, P']","['Landsverk HB', 'Carlson CR', 'Steen RL', 'Vossebein L', 'Herberg FW', 'Tasken K', 'Collas P']","['Institute of Medical Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, University of Oslo, PO Box 1112 Blindern, 0317 Oslo, Norway.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Cell Sci,Journal of cell science,0052457,"['0 (AKAP8L protein, human)', '0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinase RIIalpha Subunit)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (PRKAR2A protein, human)', '2ZD004190S (Threonine)', 'EC 2.7.11.11 (Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Cell Cycle/physiology', 'Cell Line/metabolism', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Chromatin/metabolism', 'Chromosomes/*metabolism', 'Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinase RIIalpha Subunit', 'Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Mitosis/*physiology', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Point Mutation/physiology', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/metabolism', 'Threonine/*metabolism']",2001/10/10 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/10/10 10:00'],"['2001/10/10 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/10 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Cell Sci. 2001 Sep;114(Pt 18):3255-64.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The cyclin B-p34(cdc2) kinase (CDK1) has been shown to phosphorylate RIIalpha on T54 and this has been proposed to alter the subcellular localization of RIIalpha. We have made stable transfectants from an RIIalpha-deficient leukemia cell line (Reh) that expresses either wild-type or mutant RIIalpha (RIIalpha(T54E)). When expressed, RIIalpha detaches from centrosomes at mitosis and dissociates from its centrosomal location in purified nucleus-centrosome complexes by incubation with CDK1 in vitro. By contrast, centrosomal RIIalpha(T54E) is not redistributed at mitosis, remains mostly associated with centrosomes during all phases of the cell cycle and cannot be solubilized by CDK1 in vitro. Furthermore, RIIalpha is solubilized from particular cell fractions and changes affinity for AKAP450 in the presence of CDK1. D and V mutations of T54 also reduce affinity for the N-terminal RII-binding domain of AKAP450, whereas small neutral residues do not change affinity detected by surface plasmon resonance. In addition, only RIIalpha(T54E) interacts with AKAP450 in a RIPA-soluble extract from mitotic cells. Finally, microtubule repolymerization from mitotic centrosomes of the RIIalpha(T54E) transfectant is poorer and occurs at a lower frequency than that of RIIalpha transfectants. Our results suggest that T54 phosphorylation of RIIalpha by CDK1 might serve to regulate the centrosomal association of PKA during the cell cycle.","['Carlson, C R', 'Witczak, O', 'Vossebein, L', 'Labbe, J C', 'Skalhegg, B S', 'Keryer, G', 'Herberg, F W', 'Collas, P', 'Tasken, K']","['Carlson CR', 'Witczak O', 'Vossebein L', 'Labbe JC', 'Skalhegg BS', 'Keryer G', 'Herberg FW', 'Collas P', 'Tasken K']","['Institute of Medical Biochemistry, University of Oslo, PO Box 1112 Blindern, N-0317 Oslo, Norway. cathrine.carlson@basalmed.uio.no']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Cell Sci,Journal of cell science,0052457,"['0 (A Kinase Anchor Proteins)', '0 (AKAP9 protein, human)', '0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Akap9 protein, rat)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinase RIIalpha Subunit)', '0 (Cytoskeletal Proteins)', '0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (PRKAR2A protein, human)', '0 (Prkar2a protein, mouse)', '0 (Prkar2a protein, rat)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.11 (Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDC2 Protein Kinase)']",IM,"['A Kinase Anchor Proteins', '*Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Animals', 'Binding Sites/physiology', 'CDC2 Protein Kinase/*metabolism', '*Carrier Proteins', 'Cell Line/metabolism', 'Centrosome/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinase RIIalpha Subunit', 'Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases/chemistry/*metabolism', '*Cytoskeletal Proteins', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'Humans', 'Luminescent Proteins/genetics', 'Mice', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Microtubules/chemistry/metabolism', 'Mitosis/*physiology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Point Mutation/genetics', 'Precipitin Tests/methods', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/metabolism', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary/physiology', 'Rats', 'Solubility', 'Subcellular Fractions/chemistry', 'Transfection']",2001/10/10 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/10/10 10:00'],"['2001/10/10 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/10 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Cell Sci. 2001 Sep;114(Pt 18):3243-54.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Specifically, in a pulmonary metastases model, we examined the potency and maintenance of an antitumor CD8(+) CTL response in vivo, as well as its effectiveness against an ""extensive"" tumor burden. The approach taken was to first generate tumor-specific CTL from mice challenged with the CMS4 sarcoma coadministered with anti-CTLA4 mAb, which has been shown to facilitate the induction of Ag-specific T cell responses in vivo. An H-2L(d)-restricted nonamer peptide, derived from an endogenous murine leukemia provirus was identified as a CMS4-reactive CTL epitope based upon the following: CTL cross-recognition of another syngeneic tumor cell line (CT26 colon carcinoma) previously characterized to express that gene product; sensitization of Ag-negative lymphoblasts or P815 targets with the peptide; and by cold target inhibition assays. In vivo, the adoptive transfer of CMS4-reactive CTL (> or =1 x 10(6)) resulted in nearly the complete regression of 3-day established lung metastases. Furthermore, mice that rejected CMS4 following a single adoptive transfer of CTL displayed antitumor activity to a rechallenge 45 days later, not only in the lung, but also at a s.c. distal site. Lastly, the adoptive transfer of CTL to mice harboring extensive pulmonary metastases (> 150 nodules) led to a substantial reduction in tumor burden. Overall, these data suggest that the adoptive transfer of tumor-specific CTL may have therapeutic potential for malignancies that proliferate in or metastasize to the lung.","['Ryan, M H', 'Bristol, J A', 'McDuffie, E', 'Abrams, S I']","['Ryan MH', 'Bristol JA', 'McDuffie E', 'Abrams SI']","['Laboratory of Tumor Immunology and Biology, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (CTLA-4 Antigen)', '0 (Ctla4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Immunoconjugates)', '7D0YB67S97 (Abatacept)']",IM,"['Abatacept', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD', 'Antigens, Differentiation/*immunology', 'CTLA-4 Antigen', 'Carcinoma', 'Cell Line', 'Cytokines', 'Female', '*Immunoconjugates', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/*methods', 'Lung Neoplasms/*secondary/*therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Sarcoma, Experimental/*therapy', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/cytology/immunology/*transplantation']",2001/10/10 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/10/10 10:00'],"['2001/10/10 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/10 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.4049/jimmunol.167.8.4286 [doi]'],ppublish,J Immunol. 2001 Oct 15;167(8):4286-92. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.167.8.4286.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: In this retrospective study, 8 patients suffering from systemic vasculitis associated with CMML are described. The French and English literature on systemic vasculitis associated with myelodysplasia was reviewed. RESULTS: All 8 patients had a systemic medium-sized vessel vasculitis which fulfilled the American College of Rheumatology criteria for polyarteritis nodosa in the setting of active CMML. Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) were negative in 7 patients. One patient had cytoplasmic ANCA by indirect immunofluorescence without antiproteinase 3 or antimyeloperoxydase antibodies on the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. At presentation, 6 patients had fever of unknown origin, 5 had polymyalgia rheumatica, 3 had sensory hearing loss, and 4 had eosinophilia. None had viral infection or drug-associated vasculitis. Diagnostic procedures included renal or hepatic angiography in 6 patients which showed microaneurysms in 4, skin and temporal artery biopsy in 2 which showed vasculitis, and 1 postmortem examination which showed gastroduodenal arteritis. All patients were treated with corticosteroids, and 7 received immunosuppressive drugs. Death was attributable to vasculitis in 2 cases, infection in 3, and other vasculitis-related causes in 2. In a review of the French-English literature, we found 11 similar cases of ANCA-negative systemic vasculitis, generally associated with refractory anemia, with or without blast excess. CONCLUSIONS: Systemic ANCA-negative polyarteritis nodosa-type vasculitis seems closely associated to CMML. Clinical presentation is nonspecific, and systemic vasculitis should be suspected when a patient with myelodysplasia develops atypical manifestations. Renal, gastrointestinal, or hepatic angiography are useful diagnostic procedures when more invasive biopsies should be avoided because of low platelet count. The prognosis of CMML-associated systemic vasculitis is poor.","['Hamidou, M A', 'Boumalassa, A', 'Larroche, C', 'El Kouri, D', 'Bletry, O', 'Grolleau, J Y']","['Hamidou MA', 'Boumalassa A', 'Larroche C', 'El Kouri D', 'Bletry O', 'Grolleau JY']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Hotel-Dieu, University Hospital Nantes, Nantes, France. mohamed.hamidou@chu-nantes.fr']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Semin Arthritis Rheum,Seminars in arthritis and rheumatism,1306053,"['0 (Antibodies, Antineutrophil Cytoplasmic)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aneurysm/diagnosis', 'Antibodies, Antineutrophil Cytoplasmic/blood', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Female', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique, Indirect', 'Glucocorticoids/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood/*complications/drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Vasculitis/blood/drug therapy/*etiology/pathology']",2001/10/09 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/10/09 10:00'],"['2001/10/09 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/09 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0049017201700455 [pii]', '10.1053/sarh.2001.27717 [doi]']",ppublish,Semin Arthritis Rheum. 2001 Oct;31(2):119-26. doi: 10.1053/sarh.2001.27717.,['Copyright 2001 by W.B.

Imaging studies showed changes consistent with leukemic infiltration of the soft tissues around the right shoulder joint and the proximal humerus. Immunophenotypic and morphologic analysis of the large number of cells obtained from the synovial fluid confirmed the shoulder synovitis to be an extramedullary manifestation of myelomonocytic blast crisis of chronic myeloid leukemia. The patient was not a candidate for aggressive chemotherapy treatment because of her poor overall condition, and she had no compatible donor for allogenic bone marrow transplantation. Her painful arthropathy was refractory to standard pain management but she achieved excellent pain relief with palliative radiation therapy. We conclude that the involvement of extramedullary sites by chronic myeloid leukemia blast cells can predate hematological blast crisis in some of chronic myeloid leukemia cases.

Oral and periodontal care must continue following cancer therapy, and requires that the health care provider have an understanding of the malignant disease, oral manifestations of the disease, medical management of the disease, and of the oral complications that may develop.","['Epstein, J B', 'Stevenson-Moore, P']","['Epstein JB', 'Stevenson-Moore P']","['British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver Hospital and Health Sciences Centre, 600 West 10th Avenue, Vancouver, BC, Canada V5Z 4E6. jepstein@bccancer.bc.ca']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Oral Oncol,Oral oncology,9709118,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Antibiotic Prophylaxis', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Bacteremia/drug therapy/etiology', 'Head and Neck Neoplasms/*complications/drug therapy', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/complications/drug therapy', 'Periodontal Diseases/*complications/therapy', 'Radiotherapy/adverse effects', 'Stomatitis, Herpetic/etiology', 'Tooth Extraction', 'Transplantation Conditioning/adverse effects']",2001/10/09 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/10/09 10:00'],"['2001/10/09 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/09 10:00 [entrez]']","['S1368837501000252 [pii]', '10.1016/s1368-8375(01)00025-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Oral Oncol. 2001 Dec;37(8):613-9. doi: 10.1016/s1368-8375(01)00025-2.,,80,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Given the fact that simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection in rhesus macaque is a well-characterized model for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), it is of great interest to develop an efficient protocol to transduce rhesus macaque primary T cells. In this study, we have used MuLV-10A1-pseudotyped retrovirus expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) to evaluate a number of ex vivo gene transfer protocols in rhesus macaque primary T lymphocytes. Our objectives in designing these protocols were (1) to test whether higher efficiency gene transfer could be obtained by combining two previously defined protocols, centrifugation at 32 degrees C and the CH-296-coated plate; and (2) to study the effect of an ex vivo gene transfer protocol on the expression of lymphocyte homing receptors L-selectin and alpha 4 beta 7 and alpha 4 beta 1 integrins. From seven independent experiments we demonstrate by flow cytometry analyses of EGFP expression that whereas centrifugation at 32 degrees C or the fibronectin fragment CH-296-coated plate protocol alone yielded 10-14% transduction efficiency, combining these two protocols resulted in 28.1-51.2% transduction efficiency. EGFP in transduced cells was expressed highly throughout the 14 days of posttransduction expansion. Our results also demonstrate that whereas the transduction procedure per se did not significantly alter the expression of lymphocyte homing receptors, anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibody stimulation profoundly reduced the expression of L-selectin. The selective reduction of L-selectin may result in significant in vivo consequences if transduced cells are infused.","['Zhou, P', 'Lee, J', 'Moore, P', 'Brasky, K M']","['Zhou P', 'Lee J', 'Moore P', 'Brasky KM']","['Department of Virology and Immunology, Southwest Foundation for Biomedical Research, San Antonio, TX 78227-5301, USA. pzhou@icarus.sfbr.org']",['eng'],['AI47682/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Hum Gene Ther,Human gene therapy,9008950,"['0 (CD28 Antigens)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (CD4 Antigens)', '0 (CD8 Antigens)', '0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Fibronectins)', '0 (Integrins)', '0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '126880-86-2 (L-Selectin)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CD28 Antigens/metabolism', 'CD3 Complex/metabolism', 'CD4 Antigens/metabolism', 'CD8 Antigens/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Separation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Culture Media', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Fibronectins/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genetic Vectors/metabolism', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Integrins/metabolism', 'Jurkat Cells', 'L-Selectin/metabolism', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Luminescent Proteins/metabolism', 'Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*metabolism', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Temperature', 'Time Factors', 'Transduction, Genetic']",2001/10/09 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/10/09 10:00'],"['2001/10/09 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/09 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/104303401753153901 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Gene Ther. 2001 Oct 10;12(15):1843-55. doi: 10.1089/104303401753153901.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The effects of melatonin on doxorubicin cytotoxicity have, therefore, been examined on human normal mammary epithelium HBL-100, on mammary adenocarcinoma MCF-7, on colon carcinoma LoVo, and on mouse P388 leukemia cell lines, and on tumor cell sublines pleiotropically resistant to anthracyclines. Melatonin in the concentration range 10-2000 pg/mL causes an inhibition of the growth of the human cell lines examined which is not clearly dose-dependent and less than 25% when significant. Melatonin similarly causes minor effects on doxorubicin cytotoxicity either on the parental human cell lines or on their resistant sublines. On the contrary, 200-1000 pg/mL melatonin cause a significant and dose-dependent partial sensitization to doxorubicin of resistant P388 mouse leukemia (P388/ADR), which occurs also in vivo, as indicated by a significant increase in survival time of the hosts. Doxorubicin intracellular concentrations in P388/ADR cells are increased by melatonin, suggesting that melatonin might inhibit P-glycoprotein-mediated doxorubicin efflux from the cells. These results indicate that the use of melatonin in clinical cancer treatment should not pose the risk of an attenuation of the effectiveness of doxorubicin, and encourage the further examination of the possible reduction by melatonin of the host toxicity of antitumor chemotherapy.","['Granzotto, M', 'Rapozzi, V', 'Decorti, G', 'Giraldi, T']","['Granzotto M', 'Rapozzi V', 'Decorti G', 'Giraldi T']","['Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Trieste, Trieste, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,J Pineal Res,Journal of pineal research,8504412,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Free Radical Scavengers)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'JL5DK93RCL (Melatonin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*toxicity', 'Antioxidants/*pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Doxorubicin/*toxicity', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Epithelial Cells/drug effects', 'Female', 'Free Radical Scavengers/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Melatonin/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*drug effects/pathology']",2001/10/09 10:00,2002/01/10 10:01,['2001/10/09 10:00'],"['2001/10/09 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/10 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/09 10:00 [entrez]']","['jpi310303 [pii]', '10.1034/j.1600-079x.2001.310303.x [doi]']",ppublish,J Pineal Res. 2001 Oct;31(3):206-13. doi: 10.1034/j.1600-079x.2001.310303.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our aims were to determine whether a cause and effect relationship exists between these two actions of PSC 833, and to assess whether the PSC 833-induced apoptosis is restricted to transformed cells. Apoptosis was determined by flow cytometry and radioactive quantitation of DNA fragmentation. PSC 833 induced apoptosis in the human T leukemia cell lines: Molt-4 and Jurkat. Analysis of the apoptosis in Molt-4 and Jurkat cells revealed that PSC 833 induced a rise in the cellular ceramide levels (as measured by the DG kinase assay). PSC 833-induced apoptosis was significantly reduced by specific inhibitors of ceramide de novo synthesis (i.e., fumonisin B1 and L-cycloserine). On the other hand, PSC 833 did not induce apoptosis in normal peripheral blood T cells regardless of whether these cells were quiescent, activated, or proliferating. Our results suggest that PSC 833 induces apoptotic death in human transformed T lymphocytes through an increase in ceramide de novo synthesis. In addition, normal lymphocytes are not susceptible to induction of apoptosis by PSC 833.

The major receptor expressed in undifferentiated A4 cells was RARalpha (primarily the RARalpha1 isoform). Following induction of myelomonocytic differentiation with granulocyte and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factors, a dramatic increase in RARalpha expression (particularly the RARalpha2 isoform) was seen. In contrast, expression of both RARalpha isoforms was rapidly extinguished upon induction of erythroid differentiation with erythropoeitin (EPO). A modest induction of RXRalpha expression was seen, particularly during differentiation in the myelomonocytic lineage. Low expression levels of RARgamma2 and RXRbeta remained unchanged, irrespective of differentiation pathway. Consistent with the gene expression patterns, RARalpha agonists and antagonists stimulated myelomonocytic and erythroid differentiation of FDCP-mixA4 cells, respectively. Taken together, these results suggest that erythropoiesis and granulopoiesis require diminished and enhanced RARalpha activities, respectively, which at physiological all-trans-retinoic acid (RA) concentrations may be accomplished by reciprocal effects of EPO and myelomonocytic growth factors on its expression. This hypothesis is corroborated by data showing that RA, which positively regulates RARalpha2 expression, can exert inhibitory effects on erythroid differentiation.","['Zhu, J', 'Heyworth, C M', 'Glasow, A', 'Huang, Q H', 'Petrie, K', 'Lanotte, M', 'Benoit, G', 'Gallagher, R', 'Waxman, S', 'Enver, T', 'Zelent, A']","['Zhu J', 'Heyworth CM', 'Glasow A', 'Huang QH', 'Petrie K', 'Lanotte M', 'Benoit G', 'Gallagher R', 'Waxman S', 'Enver T', 'Zelent A']","['Leukaemia Research Fund Centre and Section of Gene Function and Regulation at the Institute of Cancer Research, Chester Beatty Laboratories, London, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (RARA protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow/physiology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics/*physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA Primers', 'Erythropoietin/genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/drug effects/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia', 'Models, Biological', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/drug effects/*genetics', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/10/06 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/10/06 10:00'],"['2001/10/06 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/06 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood.v98.8.2563 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)56948-6 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2001 Oct 15;98(8):2563-7. doi: 10.1182/blood.v98.8.2563.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The resultant fusion proteins have constitutive PDGFbetaR tyrosine kinase activity, but the partner genes previously reported (tel, Huntingtin interacting protein 1 [HIP-1], H4/D10S170) have poorly understood roles in the oncogenic activity of the fusion proteins. A novel PDGFbetaR fusion protein has been characterized in a patient with CMML and an acquired t(5;17)(q33;p13). Southern blot analysis on patient leukemia cells demonstrated involvement of the PDGFbetaR gene. Using 5' rapid amplification of complementary DNA ends-polymerase chain reaction (RACE-PCR) on patient RNA, rabaptin-5 was identified as a novel partner fused in-frame to the PDGFbetaR gene. The new fusion protein includes more than 85% of the native Rabaptin-5 fused to the transmembrane and intracellular tyrosine kinase domains of the PDGFbetaR. Transduction with a retroviral vector expressing rabaptin-5/PDGFbetaR transformed the hematopoietic cell line Ba/F3 to growth factor independence and caused a fatal myeloproliferative disease in mice. Rabaptin-5 is a well-studied protein shown to be an essential and rate-limiting component of early endosomal fusion through interaction with the Ras family GTPases Rab5 and Rab4. The fusion protein includes 3 of 4 coiled-coil domains (involved in homodimerization of native rabaptin-5), 2 caspase-3 cleavage sites, and a binding site for the tumor suppressor gene tuberin (tuberous sclerosis complex-2). Early endosomal transport is critical in regulation of various growth factor receptors, through ligand-induced clathrin-mediated endocytosis, and thus this new fusion protein links together 2 important pathways of growth regulation.","['Magnusson, M K', 'Meade, K E', 'Brown, K E', 'Arthur, D C', 'Krueger, L A', 'Barrett, A J', 'Dunbar, C E']","['Magnusson MK', 'Meade KE', 'Brown KE', 'Arthur DC', 'Krueger LA', 'Barrett AJ', 'Dunbar CE']","['Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, and Laboratory of Pathology, Division of Clinical Sciences, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA. magnussm@nhlbi.nih.gov']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RABEP1 protein, human)', '0 (Rabep1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Vesicular Transport Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor beta)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cell Line', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/*blood/genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Membrane Proteins/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor beta/*genetics', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transfection', 'Translocation, Genetic', '*Vesicular Transport Proteins']",2001/10/06 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/10/06 10:00'],"['2001/10/06 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/06 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood.v98.8.2518 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)56943-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2001 Oct 15;98(8):2518-25. doi: 10.1182/blood.v98.8.2518.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As a result, it is difficult to infer the functional relevance of a pathway acting alone or in cooperation with another. One or 2 second-tier kinases represented in the p21ras and phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI-3-kinase) pathways (activated RafCAAX and gag-akt, respectively) were expressed in parental H7 interleukin-3 (IL-3)-dependent myeloid cells. IL-3-dependent cells served, independently, as recipients of p210BCR-ABL, which activated p21ras and PI-3-kinase pathways, including raf/erk and akt, respectively, en route to transformation. By contrast, neither RafCAAX nor gag-akt when expressed in parental cells in isolation produced factor-independent cells. On the other hand, H7 cells expressing both RafCAAX and gag-akt (H7gag-akt/RafCAAX) were transformed. Such transformation in H7gag-akt/RafCAAX was accomplished in the absence of active versions of Shc or cbl, and there was no evidence of Stat activity and only modest amounts of bcl-xL, a Stat5 transcriptional target protein, all of which characterized the cells transformed by BCR-ABL. However, H7gag-akt/RafCAAX cells and H7BCR-ABL cells cultured in the absence of IL-3 shared strikingly increased p65 nuclear factor kappaB (NFkappaB) activity. Treatment of cells with a specific NFkappaB inhibitor, parthenolide, led to loss of NFkappaB activity and down-regulation of antiapoptotic c-IAP2. In cells with only gag-akt/RafCAAX, this was sufficient to allow polyADP ribosyltransferase (PARP)-degradative apoptosis, but in cells with p210BCR-ABL, apoptosis was blocked, possibly by a Stat5/bcl-xL-dependent mechanism. Therefore, one hematopoietic antiapoptotic program, among others, available to certain tyrosine kinase oncogenes involves a cooperative response between raf/erk and akt, unambiguous components of p21ras and PI-3-kinase pathways, to induce p65 NFkappaB and c-IAP2.","['Gelfanov, V M', 'Burgess, G S', 'Litz-Jackson, S', 'King, A J', 'Marshall, M S', 'Nakshatri, H', 'Boswell, H S']","['Gelfanov VM', 'Burgess GS', 'Litz-Jackson S', 'King AJ', 'Marshall MS', 'Nakshatri H', 'Boswell HS']","['Walther Cancer Institute and Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, Indiana University School of Medicine and VA Medical Center, Indianapolis, IN 46202, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '0 (inhibitor of apoptosis, Nucleopolyhedrovirus)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (AKT1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Division', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/metabolism', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins', 'Interleukin-3/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', 'Mice', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'NF-kappa B/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', '*Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Simian virus 40/genetics', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Viral Proteins/metabolism']",2001/10/06 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/10/06 10:00'],"['2001/10/06 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/06 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood.v98.8.2508 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)56942-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2001 Oct 15;98(8):2508-17. doi: 10.1182/blood.v98.8.2508.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Investigated was whether cotransfection of RAG1 and RAG2 genes in combination with lymphoid transcription factors can induce TCR gene rearrangements in nonlymphoid human cells. Transfection experiments showed that basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors E2A and HEB induce rearrangements in the TCRD locus (Ddelta2-Ddelta3 and Vdelta2-Ddelta3) and TCRG locus (psi Vgamma7-Jgamma2.3 and Vgamma8-Jgamma2.3). Analysis of these rearrangements and their circular excision products revealed some peculiar characteristics. The Vdelta2-Ddelta3 rearrangements were formed by direct coupling without intermediate Ddelta2 gene segment usage, and most Ddelta2-Ddelta3 recombinations occurred via direct coupling of the respective upstream and downstream recombination signal sequences (RSSs) with deletion of the Ddelta2 and Ddelta3 coding sequences. Subsequently, the E2A/HEB-induced TCR gene recombination patterns were compared with those in early thymocytes and acute lymphoblastic leukemias of T- and B-lineage origin, and it was found that the TCR rearrangements in the transfectants were early (immature) and not necessarily T-lineage specific. Apparently, some parts of the TCRD (Vdelta2-Ddelta region) and TCRG genes are accessible for recombination not only in T cells, but also in early B-cells and even in nonlymphoid cells if the appropriate transcription factors are present. The transfection system described here appeared to be useful for studying the accessibility of immunoglobulin and TCR genes for V(D)J recombination, but might also be applied to study the induction of RSS-mediated chromosome aberrations.","['Langerak, A W', 'Wolvers-Tettero, I L', 'van Gastel-Mol, E J', 'Oud, M E', 'van Dongen, J J']","['Langerak AW', 'Wolvers-Tettero IL', 'van Gastel-Mol EJ', 'Oud ME', 'van Dongen JJ']","['Department of Immunology, Erasmus University Rotterdam/University Hospital Rotterdam, The Netherlands. langerak@immu.fgg.eur.nl']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (TCF3 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '142661-93-6 (TCF12 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (DNA Nucleotidyltransferases)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (VDJ Recombinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors', 'Cell Line', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA Nucleotidyltransferases/metabolism', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', '*Gene Rearrangement, T-Lymphocyte', '*Helix-Loop-Helix Motifs', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/immunology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/genetics', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta/genetics', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Recombination, Genetic', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Transfection', 'VDJ Recombinases']",2001/10/06 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/10/06 10:00'],"['2001/10/06 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/06 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood.v98.8.2456 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)56936-X [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2001 Oct 15;98(8):2456-65. doi: 10.1182/blood.v98.8.2456.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, there was an increase in clinical remission rate and a trend toward a better tolerance of fludarabine over ChOP that may influence the choice between these regimens as front-line treatments in patients with CLL.","['Leporrier, M', 'Chevret, S', 'Cazin, B', 'Boudjerra, N', 'Feugier, P', 'Desablens, B', 'Rapp, M J', 'Jaubert, J', 'Autrand, C', 'Divine, M', 'Dreyfus, B', 'Maloum, K', 'Travade, P', 'Dighiero, G', 'Binet, J L', 'Chastang, C']","['Leporrier M', 'Chevret S', 'Cazin B', 'Boudjerra N', 'Feugier P', 'Desablens B', 'Rapp MJ', 'Jaubert J', 'Autrand C', 'Divine M', 'Dreyfus B', 'Maloum K', 'Travade P', 'Dighiero G', 'Binet JL', 'Chastang C']","[""Service d'Hematologie, CHU Caen, France. leporrier-m@chu-caen.fr""]",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Phosphoramide Mustards)', '106XV160TZ (Vidarabine Phosphate)', '1X9VK9O1SC (fludarabine phosphate)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'CAP protocol 1', 'CHOP protocol']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Cisplatin/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Disease Progression', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hospitalization/statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Phosphoramide Mustards/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Sample Size', 'Survival Rate', 'Time Factors', 'Vidarabine Phosphate/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives/*therapeutic use', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage/adverse effects']",2001/10/06 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/10/06 10:00'],"['2001/10/06 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/06 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood.v98.8.2319 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)56918-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2001 Oct 15;98(8):2319-25. doi: 10.1182/blood.v98.8.2319.,,,,,,,,,,['French Cooperative Group on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia'],,,,,,,,,,

Cells of this nature, herein referred to as leukemic stem cells (LSCs), have been documented for nearly all AML subtypes and appear to fulfill the criteria for stem cells in that they are self-renewing and give rise to the cells found in many leukemic populations. Because these cells are likely to be critical for the genesis and perpetuation of leukemic disease, the present studies sought to characterize unique molecular properties of the LSC population, with particular emphasis on the transcription factor, nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB). Previous experiments have shown that unstimulated human CD34(+) progenitor cells do not express NF-kappaB. In contrast, primary AML CD34(+) cells display readily detectable NF-kappaB activity as assessed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay and gene expression studies. Furthermore, detailed analyses of enriched AML stem cells (CD34(+)/CD38(-)/CD123(+)) indicate that NF-kappaB is also active in the LSC population. Given the expression of NF-kappaB in leukemic, but not normal primitive cells, the hypothesis that inhibition of NF-kappaB might induce leukemia-specific apoptosis was tested by treating primary cells with the proteasome inhibitor MG-132, a well-known inhibitor of NF-kappaB. Leukemic CD34(+)/CD38(-) cells displayed a rapid induction of cell death in response to MG-132, whereas normal CD34(+)/CD38(-) cells showed little if any effect. Taken together, these data indicate that primitive AML cells aberrantly express NF-kappaB and that the presence of this factor may provide unique opportunities to preferentially ablate LSCs.","['Guzman, M L', 'Neering, S J', 'Upchurch, D', 'Grimes, B', 'Howard, D S', 'Rizzieri, D A', 'Luger, S M', 'Jordan, C T']","['Guzman ML', 'Neering SJ', 'Upchurch D', 'Grimes B', 'Howard DS', 'Rizzieri DA', 'Luger SM', 'Jordan CT']","['Blood and Marrow Transplant Program, Markey Cancer Center, Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of Kentucky Medical Center, Lexington 40536-0093, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Culture Media, Serum-Free)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Leupeptins)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', 'RF1P63GW3K (benzyloxycarbonylleucyl-leucyl-leucine aldehyde)']",IM,"['Actins/genetics', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, CD34/analysis', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Culture Media, Serum-Free', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/pathology/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*blood', 'Leupeptins/pharmacology', 'NF-kappa B/antagonists & inhibitors/*blood', 'Reference Values', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/10/06 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/10/06 10:00'],"['2001/10/06 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/06 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood.v98.8.2301 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)56916-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2001 Oct 15;98(8):2301-7. doi: 10.1182/blood.v98.8.2301.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Free HCV preferentially binds to human mononuclear cell lines but free and complexed virus binds equally to platelets. The extent of free HCV binding to human Molt-4 T cells (which express CD81) and to human promonocytic U937 cells or to platelets (which do not express CD81) was similar. The binding of free HCV to the cell lines was saturated at a virus dose of 1 IU HCV RNA per cell but binding to platelets was not saturable. Human anti-HCV IgG, but not anti-CD81, markedly inhibited HCV binding to target cells in a dose-dependent manner. Human antibodies to HCV hypervariable region 1 of E2 glycoprotein partially inhibited viral binding to target cells. Recombinant E2 also inhibited viral binding to target cells in a dose-dependent manner, with the efficacy of this decreasing in the rank order of Molt-4 cells more than U937 cells more than platelets. In contrast to HCV, recombinant E2 bound to Molt-4 cells to an extent markedly greater than that apparent with U937 cells or platelets. These results suggest that the binding of HCV to blood cells is mediated by multiple cell surface receptors and that recombinant E2 binding may not be representative of the interaction of the intact virus with target cells.","['Hamaia, S', 'Li, C', 'Allain, J P']","['Hamaia S', 'Li C', 'Allain JP']","['Division of Transfusion Medicine, Department of Haematology, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD81 protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Tetraspanin 28)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '157184-61-7 (glycoprotein E2, Hepatitis C virus)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Viral/*physiology', 'Antigens, CD/physiology', 'Blood Platelets/*virology', 'Hepacivirus/immunology/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*virology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/*virology', '*Membrane Proteins', 'Receptors, Virus/*physiology', 'Recombinant Proteins/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/virology', 'Tetraspanin 28', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'U937 Cells', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/genetics/immunology']",2001/10/06 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/10/06 10:00'],"['2001/10/06 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/06 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood.v98.8.2293 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)56915-2 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2001 Oct 15;98(8):2293-300. doi: 10.1182/blood.v98.8.2293.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cytokine messenger RNA (mRNA) was measured using a ribonuclease protection assay and cytokine protein production by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Primary HBECs were freshly isolated from operated lung, cultured to confluence, and exposed to 10 to 500 microg/ml of a suspension of ambient particulate matter with a diameter of less than 10 microm (PM(10)) for 2, 8, and 24 h. The mRNA levels of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interleukin (IL)-1alpha, and IL-8 were increased after exposure to PM(10), and this increase was dose-dependent between 100 (P < 0.05) and 500 (P < 0.05) microg/ml of PM(10) exposure. The concentrations of LIF, GM-CSF, IL-1beta, and IL-8 protein measured in the supernatant collected at 24 h increased in a dose- dependent manner and were significantly higher than those in the control nonexposed cells. The soluble fraction of the PM(10) (100 microg/ml) did not increase these cytokine mRNA levels compared with control values and were significantly lower compared with HBECs exposed to 100 microg/ml of PM(10) (LIF, IL-8, and IL-1beta; P < 0.05), except for GM-CSF mRNA (P = not significant). We conclude that primary HBECs exposed to ambient PM(10) produce proinflammatory mediators that contribute to the local and systemic inflammatory response, and we speculate that these mediators may have a role in the pathogenesis of cardiopulmonary disease associated with particulate air pollution.","['Fujii, T', 'Hayashi, S', 'Hogg, J C', 'Vincent, R', 'Van Eeden, S F']","['Fujii T', 'Hayashi S', 'Hogg JC', 'Vincent R', 'Van Eeden SF']","[""Pulmonary Research Laboratory, University of British Columbia, St. Paul's Hospital, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Respir Cell Mol Biol,American journal of respiratory cell and molecular biology,8917225,"['0 (Air Pollutants)', '0 (Cytokines)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Air Pollutants/*pharmacology', 'Bronchi/cytology/*immunology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytokines/genetics/*metabolism', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Epithelial Cells/cytology/*immunology', 'Gene Expression Regulation/physiology', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Particle Size']",2001/10/06 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/10/06 10:00'],"['2001/10/06 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/06 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1165/ajrcmb.25.3.4445 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Respir Cell Mol Biol. 2001 Sep;25(3):265-71. doi: 10.1165/ajrcmb.25.3.4445.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The general features of the retinal vascular anatomy of these two primates have much in common with more widely studied animal models such as rat and cat. However, primates are unique amongst mammals in having a region in temporal retina specialized for high visual acuity, which includes the fovea centralis (or 'fovea'). Several features distinguish the fovea from other parts of the retina, including a very high local density of cone photoreceptors, a high density of inner retinal cells during development, and an absence of retinal blood vessels. The retinal vascular complex comprises a number of cell types, in addition to vascular endothelial cells, including pericytes, microglia, astrocytes-none of which is intrinsic to the retina. In addition, amacrine-like cells make bouton-like associations with retinal vessels and may be involved in the autoregulation of blood flow. During development endothelial cells 'invade' the retina, accompanied by a population of microglial cells; glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-immunoreactive astrocytes are also seen associated with the developing vasculature, and are in advance of the vascular front by a few hundred microns. Recent findings indicate that astrocytes at the vascular front proliferate in response to factors released by endothelial cells, including leukemia inhibitory factor. Better understood is the role of GFAP-immunoreactive astrocytes just in advance of the developing vessels. These astrocytes are sensitive to hypoxia and in response release vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) which in turn promotes the migration, differentiation and proliferation of vascular endothelial cells. This hypoxia/VEGF-mediated process of migration, proliferation and differentiation appears common to the retinae of a variety of species, including human. However, in human and macaque retina, different mechanisms appear to govern the development of the retinal vessels growing along the horizontal meridian of the retina towards the central area, which contains the fovea. Despite the relatively advanced state of differentiation and maturation of cells in the central area compared with the periphery, the growth of retinal vessels into the central area has been described as 'retarded', and the incidence of cell proliferation associated with these vessels is lower than in peripheral vessels. Furthermore, neither retinal vessels nor their accompanying astrocytes grow into a circumscribed region which, at a later stage, develops into the foveal depression. These observations suggest that molecular markers define the foveal region and inhibit cell proliferation and vascular growth at the fovea and, perhaps, along the horizontal meridian. The findings also suggest that at the fovea, the retina is adapted morphologically to its blood supply, since in the vicinity of the fovea, the development of retinal vessels is retarded or inhibited. The limitations on vascularization of central retina has implications for its vulnerability to degenerative changes, as seen in age-related macular degeneration.","['Provis, J M']",['Provis JM'],"['Department of Anatomy & Histology, Save Sight Institute, Anderson Stuart Bldg (F13), University of Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia. jprovis@anatomy.usyd.edu.au']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Prog Retin Eye Res,Progress in retinal and eye research,9431859,,IM,"['Animals', 'Astrocytes/cytology', 'Macaca/*anatomy & histology', 'Microglia/cytology', 'Neurons/cytology', 'Pericytes/cytology', 'Retina/*anatomy & histology/growth & development', 'Retinal Vessels/*anatomy & histology/growth & development']",2001/10/06 10:00,2002/02/05 10:01,['2001/10/06 10:00'],"['2001/10/06 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/02/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/06 10:00 [entrez]']","['S135094620100012X [pii]', '10.1016/s1350-9462(01)00012-x [doi]']",ppublish,Prog Retin Eye Res. 2001 Nov;20(6):799-821. doi: 10.1016/s1350-9462(01)00012-x.,,113,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Until recently. autologous and allogeneic BMT or mobilized blood stem cell transplantation was used primarily to replace a malignant, genetically abnormal, or deficient immunohematopoietic compartment, and therefore highly toxic myeloablative regimens were considered mandatory for eradication of all undesirable host-derived hematopoietic elements. Our preclinical and ongoing clinical studies have indicated that more effective eradication of host immunohematopoietic system cells could be achieved by adoptive allogeneic cell therapy with donor lymphocyte infusion following BMT. Thus eradication of blood cancer cells, especially in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia and less frequently in patients with other hematologic malignancies, can frequently be achieved despite complete resistance of such tumor cells to the maximum tolerated doses of chemoradiotherapy. Our cumulative experience suggests that graft vs leukemia (GVL) effects might be a useful tool for eradication of otherwise resistant tumor cells of host origin. Based on the cumulative clinical experience and experimental data in animal models of human diseases, it appears that induction of host vs graft tolerance as the first step may allow durable engraftment of immunocompetent donor lymphocytes, which may be used for induction of effective biologic warfare against host-type immunohematopoietic cells that need to be replaced, whether they are malignant, genetically abnormal, or self-reactive. Based on this rationale, we speculate that the therapeutic benefit of BMT may be increased by using safer conditioning as part of the transplantation procedure, with the goal of inducing host vs graft tolerance to enable subsequent induction of GVL, possibly graft vs tumor, or even graft vs autoimmunity effects, rather than attempting to eliminate host cells with hazardous myeloablative chemoradiotherapy. Our hypothesis suggests that effective BMT procedures might be accomplished without lethal conditioning of the host, using new, well-tolerated nonmyeloablative regimens, possibly minimizing immediate and late side effects related to myeloablative procedures. Recent clinical data suggest that effective BMT procedures may be accomplished with nonmyeloablative stem cell transplantation (NST) regimens, with no major toxicity.

Several factors cast doubt on these assumptions. For example, it is understood that patients who receive transplants are already selected to be at lower risk of relapse, and in addition the risk of relapse varies considerably among patients. This can be predicted by several risk factors, the most powerful of which is cytogenetics. Major collaborative group trials have attempted to evaluate the contribution of autograft and allograft to AML treatment in CR1. The EORTC-GIEMEMA, GOELAM, UK MRC, and US Intergroup trials randomized approximately 1200 patients to autograft versus, or in addition to, chemotherapy. Although relapse risk was reduced in all studies, overall survival was not better in three of the trials. Only the MRC trial showed a survival benefit, but only in patients beyond 2 years of follow-up. Patients in these trials for whom donors were available were allocated to allogeneic transplant. This enabled the evaluation of allograft in a donor versus no donor (intent-to-treat) analysis. No study showed a survival benefit for the donor arm, although there was a substantial reduction in relapse risk. Analysis within risk groups suggests that transplantation for good-risk patients is not appropriate and the role of transplantation is uncertain in other groups.","['Burnett, A K']",['Burnett AK'],"['Department of Haematology, University of Wales College of Medicine, Heath Park, Cardiff, UK. burnettak@cardiff.ac.uk']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,,IM,"['Bone Marrow Transplantation/*methods', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/*therapy', 'Prospective Studies', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2001/10/06 10:00,2001/10/12 10:01,['2001/10/06 10:00'],"['2001/10/06 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/12 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/06 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s002800100306 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2001 Aug;48 Suppl 1:S53-8. doi: 10.1007/s002800100306.,,21,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Approaches such as consolidation treatment, prolonged maintenance, and autologous or allogeneic transplantation in first remission are directed against the minimal residual disease in which a malignant cell population has survived induction treatment and shows resistance due to special genetic or kinetic features. In contrast, induction therapy deals with naive tumor cells possibly different from their counterparts in remission in terms of their kinetic status and sensitivity. Therefore, in AML the introduction of intensification strategies into the induction phase of treatment has been suggested as a new step in addition to intensification in the postremission phase. As expected from the dose effects observed in post-remission treatment with high-dose cytarabine (AraC) or longer treatment, similar dose effects have been found in induction treatment both from the incorporation of high-dose AraC and from the double-induction strategy used in patients up to 60 years of age. As a particular effect, patients with poor-risk AML according to an unfavorable karyotype, high LDH in serum, or a delayed response show longer survival following double induction containing high-dose AraC as compared to standard-dose AraC. A corresponding dose effect in the induction treatment of patients aged 60 years and older has been found with daunorubicin 60 vs 30 mg/m2 as part of the thioguanine/ AraC/daunorubicin (TAD) regimen with the higher dosage significantly increasing the response rate and survival in these older patients who represent a poor-risk group as a whole. Thus we have been able to demonstrate both in younger and older patients that a poor prognosis can be improved by a more intensive induction therapy. High-dose AraC in induction, however, exhibits cumulative toxicity in that repeated courses containing high-dose AraC in the post-remission period lead to long-lasting aplasias of about 6 weeks. Thus after intensive induction treatment, high-dose chemotherapy in remission may be practicable using stem-cell rescue and may contribute to a further improvement in the outcome in poor-risk as well as average-risk patients with AML. These approaches are currently under investigation by the German AML Cooperative Group (AMLCG). ""The more intensive the better"" is certainly not the way to go in the management of AML and other systemic malignancies but some increase in intensity may be possible and better.","['Buchner, T', 'Hiddemann, W', 'Berdel, W', 'Wormann, B', 'Loffler, H', 'Schoch, C', 'Haferlach, T', 'Ludwig, W D', 'Maschmeyer, G', 'Staib, P', 'Andreesen, R', 'Balleisen, L', 'Haase, D', 'Eimermacher, H', 'Aul, C', 'Rasche, H', 'Uhlig, J', 'Gruneisen, A', 'Reis, H E', 'Hartlapp, J', 'Hirschmann, W D', 'Weh, H J', 'Pielken, H J', 'Gassmann, W', 'Sauerland, M C', 'Heinecke, A']","['Buchner T', 'Hiddemann W', 'Berdel W', 'Wormann B', 'Loffler H', 'Schoch C', 'Haferlach T', 'Ludwig WD', 'Maschmeyer G', 'Staib P', 'Andreesen R', 'Balleisen L', 'Haase D', 'Eimermacher H', 'Aul C', 'Rasche H', 'Uhlig J', 'Gruneisen A', 'Reis HE', 'Hartlapp J', 'Hirschmann WD', 'Weh HJ', 'Pielken HJ', 'Gassmann W', 'Sauerland MC', 'Heinecke A']","['Department of Medicine, Hematology/Oncology, University of Munster, Germany. buechnr@uni-muenster.de']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)', 'DAT protocol 1']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Remission Induction', 'Thioguanine/administration & dosage']",2001/10/06 10:00,2001/10/12 10:01,['2001/10/06 10:00'],"['2001/10/06 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/12 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/06 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s002800100305 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2001 Aug;48 Suppl 1:S41-4. doi: 10.1007/s002800100305.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

From the beginning of recorded time, the human life-span changed little until the twentieth century. In the USA, it increased from 47.3 years in 1900 to 76.4 years in 2000. The answer to the question of ""Can we cure cancer in the twenty-first century?"" requires an appreciation of the contemporary nature of our knowledge. At the beginning of the twentieth century, major problems were nutrition and infection. By 1950, the major causes of mortality and morbidity were still infectious diseases, such as syphilis, tuberculosis, poliomyelitis, and influenza. The 1950s and 1960s were the golden age of control of infectious diseases, while cancer, because of the aging of the population and the strong association between cancer and age, has become the major healthcare problem of the twenty-first century. Until 1960, no one had proposed or demonstrated that a systemic or metastatic form of cancer could be cured. In only 35-40 years not only have techniques for the early detection, prevention, and surgical and radiation therapy treatments improved, but at least 15-20% of patients with systemic/metastatic cancers can be cured with our current primitive systemic treatments. Prior to 1943, there was no chemotherapy. Prior to 1948, no one had described complete regression of a systemic cancer. There were no multi-institution, randomized clinical trials prior to 1949. Additionally, combination chemotherapy, new drugs, bone marrow transplantation, broad-spectrum antibiotics to control infections, and platelets to control hemorrhage have been added in the past 50 years. The pace of progress extrapolates to a prediction of cancer control in the twenty-first century. The human genome has been sequenced, and it will be possible to identify expression profiles not only for malignant cells but for their normal counterparts. It is certain that interventions specific for control of the malignant transformation will be identified. An example of gene-directed therapy is in acute promyelocytic leukemia where trans-retinoic acid is effective and contributes to cure. The signal transduction inhibitors, small molecules bioavailable orally and specific for interfering with signals resulting from ligand-receptor interactions, are a dramatic advance. Because cancer is a genetic disorder, the expanding field of genomics will certainly accelerate our progress toward the control of cancer. Finally, the twenty-first century will be an era of enhanced communication. The computer has given us the internet. Our communication in cyberspace is not only universal but instantaneous. Increases in the speed at which knowledge can be exchanged and the enormous capacity for storing new knowledge in cyberspace ensure that the pace of progress that we saw in the twentieth century will accelerate in the twenty-first. To address the question in the title of this paper, I believe that it is not a question of whether, but only of when.","['Freireich, E J']",['Freireich EJ'],"['Adult Leukemia Research Program, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Forecasting', 'Humans', 'Medical Oncology/*trends', 'Neoplasms/genetics/prevention & control/*therapy']",2001/10/06 10:00,2001/10/12 10:01,['2001/10/06 10:00'],"['2001/10/06 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/12 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/06 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s002800100298 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2001 Aug;48 Suppl 1:S4-10. doi: 10.1007/s002800100298.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

AML-1 binds DNA and activates or represses transcription, while the chromosomal translocation fusion proteins in acute myeloid leukemia subvert these functions. The t(8;21) is the second most frequent translocation in acute myeloid leukemia and creates a fusion between the DNA binding domain of AML-1 and the ETO (also known as MTG8) corepressor. The t(12;21) is found in up to 25% of pediatric B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias and fuses the ETS family transcription factor TEL to the amino terminus of AML-1. In addition, the inv(16), the most frequent translocation in acute myeloid leukemia, fuses the AML-1 cofactor CBFbeta to the smooth muscle myosin heavy chain MYH11. Both the t(8;21) and t(12;21) create transcriptional repressors that impair AML-1 target gene expression. We demonstrated that the fusion proteins encoded by these translocations contact the nuclear hormone corepressors (N-CoR/SMRT), mSin3A, and histone deacetylases. We have also found that both TEL and AML-1 interact with mSin3A. TEL also binds N-CoR and histone deacetylase-3, indicating that wild-type TEL is a transcriptional repressor. The t(12;21) fuses the mSin3A interaction domain of TEL to AML-1 to transform AML-1 from a regulated to an unregulated transcriptional repressor. The recognition that AML-1 interacts with mSin3A to repress transcription suggested that the inv(16) fusion protein might also repress the transcription of AML-1-target genes. In fact, the inv(16) encodes a protein that cooperates with AML-1 to repress transcription. The inv(16) fusion protein was found in a ternary complex with AML-1 and mSin3A, suggesting that the inv(16) also acts by recruiting transcriptional corepressors and histone deacetylases.","['Heibert, S W', 'Lutterbach, B', 'Durst, K', 'Wang, L', 'Linggi, B', 'Wu, S', 'Wood, L', 'Amann, J', 'King, D', 'Hou, Y']","['Heibert SW', 'Lutterbach B', 'Durst K', 'Wang L', 'Linggi B', 'Wu S', 'Wood L', 'Amann J', 'King D', 'Hou Y']","['Department of Biochemistry, Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN 37232, USA. scott.hiebert@mcmail.vanderbilt.edu']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (AML1-ETO fusion protein, human)', '0 (CBFbeta-MYH11 fusion protein)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (NCOR1 protein, human)', '0 (Ncor1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Receptor Co-Repressor 1)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (TEL-AML1 fusion protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'COS Cells', 'Chromosome Inversion', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 12', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 16', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 18', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Nuclear Receptor Co-Repressor 1', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism/physiology', 'Transcription, Genetic/*physiology', 'Translocation, Genetic']",2001/10/06 10:00,2001/10/12 10:01,['2001/10/06 10:00'],"['2001/10/06 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/12 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/06 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s002800100302 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2001 Aug;48 Suppl 1:S31-4. doi: 10.1007/s002800100302.,,22,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we describe one possibility for extending the frontier of mechanism-based medicine for acute myeloid leukemia (AML). FLT3, a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) preferentially expressed in hematopoietic progenitor cells, frequently has a gain-of-function mutation in AML. To search for FLT3-targeted compounds, we screened the growth-inhibitory effects of several tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) on mutant FLT3-transformed 32D cells. Herbimycin A at a concentration of 0.1 microM markedly inhibited the growth of the transfectants but at that concentration was ineffective in parental 32D cells. It suppressed the constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation of the mutant FLT3, but not the phosphorylation of the ligand-stimulated wild-type FLT3. In mice transplanted with transformed 32D cells, the administration of herbimycin A completely prevented leukemia progression. Recent studies have indicated that herbimycin A binds directly with HSP90, a molecular chaperone, and destabilizes HSP90-associated proteins. Another HSP90 inhibitor, radicicol, also induced apoptosis selectively in transformed 32D cells. HSP90 is a promising target for the treatment of AML with mutant FLT3.","['Naoe, T', 'Kiyoe, H', 'Yamamoto, Y', 'Minami, Y', 'Yamamoto, K', 'Ueda, R', 'Saito, H']","['Naoe T', 'Kiyoe H', 'Yamamoto Y', 'Minami Y', 'Yamamoto K', 'Ueda R', 'Saito H']","['Department of Infectious Diseases, Nagoya University School of Medicine, Japan. tnaoe@med.nagoya-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Benzoquinones)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Lactams, Macrocyclic)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Quinones)', '1W306TDA6S (Rifabutin)', '70563-58-5 (herbimycin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Flt3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Benzoquinones', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Lactams, Macrocyclic', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/enzymology/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mutation', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Quinones/pharmacology', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Rifabutin/analogs & derivatives', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3']",2001/10/06 10:00,2001/10/12 10:01,['2001/10/06 10:00'],"['2001/10/06 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/12 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/06 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s002800100301 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2001 Aug;48 Suppl 1:S27-30. doi: 10.1007/s002800100301.,,35,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RARalpha variably fuses to PML, PLZF, NPM, NuMA, and Stat5B genes (X genes/proteins). These translocations are balanced and reciprocal, thus leading to the generation of X-RARalpha and RARalpha-X fusion genes of which the products coexist in the APL blast. The invariable involvement in these translocations of RARalpha, a prototypical transcription factor, makes APL a compelling example of aberrant transcriptional mechanisms in the etiopathogenesis of cancer. This paper focuses on the recent progress in defining the molecular mechanisms underlying APL pathogenesis and addresses how this new understanding has allowed the proposal and development of novel therapeutic strategies with compounds such as histone deacetylase inhibitors and inorganic arsenicals such as As2O3 which are currently being tested in murine leukemia models as well as in human APL patients. In particular, the crucial role played by the aberrant transcriptional activities of X-RARalpha and RARalpha-X fusion proteins in APL pathogenesis is discussed by reviewing the relevant therapeutic implications resulting from this analysis.","['Pandolfi, P P']",['Pandolfi PP'],"['Department of Human Genetics, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Cornell University, New York, NY 10021, USA. p-pandolfi@ski.mskcc.org']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (NPM-RARalpha protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (NuMa-RARalpha protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (PLZF-RARalpha fusion protein, human)', '0 (PLZF-RARalpha fusion protein, mouse)', '0 (RARA protein, human)', '0 (Rara protein, mouse)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', '*Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy/genetics', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/physiology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/physiology', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/genetics', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha', 'Transcription, Genetic/*drug effects/physiology', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology']",2001/10/06 10:00,2001/10/12 10:01,['2001/10/06 10:00'],"['2001/10/06 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/12 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/06 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s002800100322 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2001 Aug;48 Suppl 1:S17-9. doi: 10.1007/s002800100322.,,9,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These proteins have activated ABL kinase activity and are located in the cytoplasm of CML cells, predominantly in the cytoskeleton. Recent studies have led to the identification of numerous potential substrates for BCR/ABL, including many proteins that normally function in signal transduction pathways downstream from hematopoietic growth factor receptors. BCR/ABL is autophosphorylated on tyrosine residues and attracts a variety of adapter proteins and other signaling proteins, setting up large signaling complexes that ultimately result in growth. viability, and adhesion signals. Using new in vitro and animal model systems, it is now becoming possible to link specific signaling pathways to biological abnormalities in CML cells. Furthermore, the relative importance of some BCR/ABL-activated pathways is becoming clear. In vivo studies in certain lines of transgenic mice suggest that the antiapoptotic effect of Bcr/Abl is more important than previously thought. Our current studies indicate important roles for phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt and for STAT molecules. As a result of these more detailed biochemical analyses of BCR/ABL function, new targets for future drug development have been identified.","['Griffin, J D']",['Griffin JD'],"['Leukemia Program, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02115, USA. james_griffin@dfci.harvard.edu']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Phosphatidylinositols)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Drug Design', 'Genes, abl/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/enzymology/genetics', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/physiology', 'Phosphatidylinositols/*physiology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/*physiology']",2001/10/06 10:00,2001/10/12 10:01,['2001/10/06 10:00'],"['2001/10/06 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/12 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/06 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s002800100299 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2001 Aug;48 Suppl 1:S11-6. doi: 10.1007/s002800100299.,,52,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This double transfection strategy is time consuming as it requires screening of many hundreds of individual clones and cannot be applied to primary hematopoietic cells. To generate a tetracycline-inducible BCR-ABL retrovirus, we have subcloned BCR-ABL p210 cDNA in the SIN-Retro-TET vector, which allows regulated expression of a gene of interest in a single autoregulatory cassette, containing both tTA and Tet OP sequences. Retroviral particles were obtained by transfecting the SIN-BCR-ABL p210 construct into the 293 cells and by VSVG pseudotyping. To determine the functionality of the retrovirus, the IL-3-dependent murine Ba/F3 cell line was retrovirally transduced and clones were grown in the absence of both IL-3 (to select for transformed cells) and a tetracycline analog, doxycycline (to induce BCR-ABL expression). Using this technique, polyclonal Ba/F3 cells and several growth factor-independent Ba/F3 clones expressing BCR-ABL were obtained within 2-3 weeks. A single dose of doxycycline added to the medium (1 microg/ml), induced in different clones, a reduction of BCR-ABL protein levels by 60-90% at 24 h, leading to cell death in the absence of IL-3. In several individual clones, BCR-ABL expression was further reduced to become almost undetectable at 48 h. The doxycycline-regulated BCR-ABL expression was stable, as many clones maintained in culture for >8 months showed a persistent inhibitory response to doxycycline addition in the medium. In in vivo experiments, subcutaneous injection of 2 x 10(6) Ba/F3-SIN p210 cells in nude mice induced visible tumors in 2 weeks and all established tumors completely regressed upon addition of doxycycline in the drinking water (200 microg/ml). To determine the functionality of the inducible BCR-ABL retrovirus in vivo, primary Lin- bone marrow cells were transduced with SIN-p210 and transplanted in lethally irradiated mice. All transplanted mice had successful hematopoietic reconstitution and BCR-ABL integration was found in the peripheral blood of seven out of 14 mice available for long-term analysis (>6 months). However, despite evidence of retrovirus-mediated gene transfer, there was no evidence of leukemia, due either to low viral titers or to the relative inefficiency of the minimal CMV promoter in primary hematopoietic cells. Thus, these results demonstrate for the first time, to our knowledge, the feasibility to generate an inducible BCR-ABL retrovirus in a single step, in the context of an immortalized cell line. Our data suggest that with further improvements of the retrovirus-mediated gene transfer technology, it might be possible to generate inducible leukemia models in mice by the use of single retroviral constructs.","['Dugray, A', 'Geay, J F', 'Foudi, A', 'Bonnet, M L', 'Vainchenker, W', 'Wendling, F', 'Louache, F', 'Turhan, A G']","['Dugray A', 'Geay JF', 'Foudi A', 'Bonnet ML', 'Vainchenker W', 'Wendling F', 'Louache F', 'Turhan AG']","['INSERM U362, Institut Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'N12000U13O (Doxycycline)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/*pharmacology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Doxycycline/pharmacology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral/drug effects/genetics', 'Gene Transfer Techniques/standards', 'Genetic Vectors/*drug effects/genetics/standards', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Homeostasis/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*genetics', 'Retroviridae/drug effects/genetics', 'Transgenes/drug effects']",2001/10/06 10:00,2002/02/23 10:01,['2001/10/06 10:00'],"['2001/10/06 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/02/23 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/06 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2402225 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2001 Oct;15(10):1658-62. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402225.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, we examined the relationship between TRAIL-induced apoptosis and TRAIL receptor expression utilising RT-PCR and flow cytometry. Two of three myeloma cell lines and Jurkat were TRAIL sensitive whereas MC/CAR was relatively resistant. Five of 16 (31%) primary tumours demonstrated > or =20% reduction in myeloma cells following TRAIL incubation (20-59%). This did not correlate with prior therapy. Four cell lines (two sensitive) and five primary tumours (two sensitive) demonstrated mRNA expression of the intra-cellular death domain containing TRAIL-R1. Variable expression of the two decoy (TRAIL-R3 and R4) and soluble (osteoprotegerin) receptors was seen and this did not correlate with TRAIL resistance. We conclude that myeloma cell expression of death effector receptors for TRAIL is insufficient to confer sensitivity to TRAIL-induced apoptosis but that in a significant minority of patients, irrespective of prior therapy, tumour cells are sensitive to TRAIL. The further investigation of TRAIL as an adjunct to presently available therapies for myeloma is justified.","['Lincz, L F', 'Yeh, T X', 'Spencer, A']","['Lincz LF', 'Yeh TX', 'Spencer A']","['Hunter Haematology Research Group, Mater Misericordiae Hospital, NSW, Australia.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (GPI-Linked Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Member 10c)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNFRSF10A protein, human)', '0 (TNFRSF10B protein, human)', '0 (TNFRSF10C protein, human)', '0 (TNFSF10 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor Decoy Receptors)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'Bone Marrow Cells/pathology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Resistance', 'Flow Cytometry', 'GPI-Linked Proteins', 'Humans', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/drug effects', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*pharmacology', 'Multiple Myeloma/*pathology', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Member 10c', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*drug effects', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor Decoy Receptors', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*pharmacology']",2001/10/06 10:00,2002/02/23 10:01,['2001/10/06 10:00'],"['2001/10/06 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/02/23 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/06 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2402251 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2001 Oct;15(10):1650-7. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402251.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This patient presented, at diagnosis, two discrete populations of CD56+ cells, one TCRgammadelta+, the second lacking T cell-restricted antigens. The cell lines derived displayed features corresponding to the two cellular components of the disease: DERL-2 was CD56+/CD3+/TcRgammadelta+ while DERL-7 was CD56+/CD3-/TcRgammadelta-. Along with CD56, the two cell lines shared the expression of CD7, CD2, CD158b and CD117. Karyotype analysis showed that both cell lines were near-diploid, with iso-7q and loss of one chromosome 10. In addition, DERL-2 showed 5q+ in all metaphases analyzed, while DERL-7 revealed loss of one chromosome 4. Genotypically, both cell lines shared the same STR pattern at nine loci and demonstrated an identical rearranged pattern of the T cell receptor genes beta, gamma and delta, with respect to the original tumor cells. These data indicated that both cell lines and the original neoplastic populations were T cell-derived and arose from a common ancestor. Among a large panel of cytokines tested, only SCF was able to substitute IL2 in supporting cell proliferation. Moreover, SCF and IL2 acted synergistically, dramatically enhancing cell growth.

Accordingly, we previously suggested that the x(c)- plasma membrane cystine transporter provided a target for lymphoid cancer therapy. Its inhibition could lead to cyst(e)ine deficiency in lymphoma cells via reduction of both their cystine uptake and cysteine supply by somatic cells. In this study, using rat Nb2 lymphoma cultures, drugs were screened for growth arrest based on x(c)- inhibition. Sulfasalazine was fortuitously found to be a novel, potent inhibitor of the x(c)- transporter. It showed high rat lymphoma growth-inhibitory and lytic activity in vitro (IC50 = 0.16 mM), based specifically on inhibition of x(c)--mediated cystine uptake, in contrast to its colonic metabolites, sulfapyridine and 5-aminosalicylic acid. Sulfasalazine was even more effective against human non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (DoHH2) cultures. In rats (n = 13), sulfasalazine (i.p.) markedly inhibited growth of well-developed, rapidly growing rat Nb2 lymphoma transplants without apparent side-effects. Reduced, macrophage-mediated supply of cysteine was probably involved. In five rats, 90-100% tumor growth suppression, relative to controls, was obtained.

Treatment of CD20+ B cells with C2B8 triggers different cell damaging effects including complement-dependent lysis of tumor cells, antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and induction of apoptosis. Dendritic cells (DC) have recently been shown to ingest cell debris and to present associated antigens even on MHC class I molecules, a mechanism called cross-presentation. In this study, we investigated whether C2B8 treatment of lymphoma promotes the induction of CD8+ T cell responses against lymphoma cell-associated antigens via, cross-presentation. We used Daudi lymphoma cells as a model system in our studies and could demonstrate, that C2B8-treated Daudi cells undergo apoptosis, are phagocytosed by DC and induce in DC typical features of maturation; among them, the induction of CD83 expression as well as the up-regulation of prominent accessory molecules (CD40, CD86) and MHC molecules. Importantly, upon co-culture of such lymphoma cell-pulsed DC with autologous T cells, we could induce efficient cytotoxic T cell (CTL) responses against Daudi cell-associated antigens. These findings suggest that antibody treatment of tumor cells can, in addition to its direct cell damaging effects, under certain conditions, contribute to an induction of potentially protective cytotoxic T cell responses.","['Selenko, N', 'Maidic, O', 'Draxier, S', 'Berer, A', 'Jager, U', 'Knapp, W', 'Stockl, J']","['Selenko N', 'Maidic O', 'Draxier S', 'Berer A', 'Jager U', 'Knapp W', 'Stockl J']","['Institute of Immunology and Department of Internal Medicine-I, University of Vienna Medical School, Austria.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Antigens, CD20)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/*pharmacology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived', 'Antigen Presentation/drug effects', 'Antigens, CD20/immunology', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/immunology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Dendritic Cells/*immunology/physiology', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma/*pathology', '*Phagocytosis', 'Rituximab', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",2001/10/06 10:00,2002/02/23 10:01,['2001/10/06 10:00'],"['2001/10/06 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/02/23 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/06 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2402226 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2001 Oct;15(10):1619-26. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402226.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Log-linear modelling identified significant linear increases in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) (average annual increase 0.7%; P= 0.005) and in Hodgkin's disease (HD) (1.2%, P=0.04), but not in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), nor in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). The increase in ALL was most pronounced amongst males, aged 1-4 years, and is likely to be due to precursor B-cell leukaemias. The increases in ALL and HD are discussed in relation to current hypotheses suggesting a role for infection.

However, these studies had not specifically addressed the question of whether the characteristic deletion was induced at a high frequency in stem cells. Using a PCR-based technique, we have studied the induction of chromosome 2 LOH in the progeny of (CBA/H x C57BL/6)F1 stem cells after a potentially leukaemogenic radiation exposure.

We evaluated the production of DC from blast cells taken at presentation from nine children with ALL. Blast cells were expanded in serum-free medium supplemented with Flt3L, G-CSF, GM-CSF, IL-3, IL-6 and SCF for 7 days and subsequently stimulated with Flt3L, GM-CSF and TGF-beta for a further 14 days, with the addition of TNF-alpha for the final 48 h of culture. Cultured cells had the morphological appearance of DC and expressed the DC-associated antigens CD1A (range 2-87%) and CD83 (15-44%). Expression of the co-stimulatory molecules CD80 and CD86 was increased and the majority of these cells retained their expression of CD34 (73+/-4%) and HLA-DR (79+/-5%). Seven of the nine ALL had a leukaemia-specific abnormality and DC generated from five of these seven cases were derived from the leukaemic clone. Leukaemic DC derived from four HLA-A*02-positive ALL pulsed with CMV-associated peptides could induce significant proliferation of peptide-specific CD8+ T cells. This specificity was verified using tetrameric complexes of HLA class l/antigenic peptide. DC could also be generated from cells taken at times of complete remission of ALL and from normal controls using these culture conditions. These findings show that functional DC can be generated both from ALL blasts and from patients in remission; these might be utilised in future for immunotherapeutic strategies in the treatment of ALL.","['Blair, A', 'Rowbottom, A W', 'Browne, S J', 'Goulden, N J', 'Steward, C G', 'Oakhill, A', 'Pamphilon, D H']","['Blair A', 'Rowbottom AW', 'Browne SJ', 'Goulden NJ', 'Steward CG', 'Oakhill A', 'Pamphilon DH']","['Bristol Institute for Transfusion Sciences and Royal Hospital for Sick Children, UK.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (Cytokines)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antigen Presentation/immunology', 'Antigens, CD34', 'Antigens, Viral/immunology', 'Cell Culture Techniques/methods', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytokines/pharmacology', 'Cytomegalovirus/immunology', 'Dendritic Cells/*cytology/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/cytology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*pathology', 'Remission Induction']",2001/10/06 10:00,2002/02/23 10:01,['2001/10/06 10:00'],"['2001/10/06 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/02/23 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/06 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2402273 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2001 Oct;15(10):1596-603. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402273.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The maximal storage duration of platelet concentrates is usually 5 days, due to the platelet storage lesion that impairs their functions when stored for longer times. Some of the morphological and biochemical changes that characterize this storage lesion are reminiscent of cell death by apoptosis. The present study analyzed whether proteins involved in nucleated cell apoptosis could play a role in the platelet storage lesion. Storage of leukocyte-depleted platelets obtained by apheresis is associated with a late and limited activation of caspases, mainly caspase-3. This event correlates with an increased expression of the pro-apoptotic BH3-only protein Bim in the particulate fraction and a slight and late release of the pro-apoptotic mitochondrial protein Diablo/Smac in the cytosol. Platelets do not express the death receptors Fas, DR4 and DR5 on their plasma membrane, while the expression of the decoy receptor DcR2 increases progressively during platelet storage. Addition of low concentrations of the cryoprotector dimethylsulfoxide accelerates platelet caspase activation during storage, an effect that is partially prevented by the caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk. Altogether, DcR2 expression on the plasma membrane is an early event while caspase activation is a late event during platelet storage. These observations suggest that caspases are unlikely to account for the platelet storage lesion. As a consequence, addition of caspase inhibitors may not improve the quality of platelet concentrates stored in standard conditions.","['Plenchette, S', 'Moutet, M', 'Benguella, M', ""N'Gondara, J P"", 'Guigner, F', 'Coffe, C', 'Corcos, L', 'Bettaieb, A', 'Solary, E']","['Plenchette S', 'Moutet M', 'Benguella M', ""N'Gondara JP"", 'Guigner F', 'Coffe C', 'Corcos L', 'Bettaieb A', 'Solary E']","['INSERM U517, Faculty of Medicine, Dijon, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BCL2L11 protein, human)', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (DIABLO protein, human)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Mitochondrial Proteins)', '0 (Protein Precursors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (TNFRSF10D protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor Decoy Receptors)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11', 'Blood Platelets/enzymology/*metabolism', 'Blood Preservation', 'Carrier Proteins/metabolism', 'Caspases/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', '*Membrane Proteins', 'Mitochondrial Proteins/metabolism', 'Platelet Transfusion', 'Protein Precursors/metabolism', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/*metabolism', 'Specimen Handling', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor Decoy Receptors']",2001/10/06 10:00,2002/02/23 10:01,['2001/10/06 10:00'],"['2001/10/06 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/02/23 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/06 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2402231 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2001 Oct;15(10):1572-81. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402231.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, in most patients the disease becomes resistant to treatment. Rolipram, a specific inhibitor of phosphodiesterase (PDE) type 4, the PDE predominantly expressed in B-CLL cells, has been shown to induce cAMP-dependent apoptosis in these cells. In the present study, we demonstrate that the extent of rolipram-induced apoptosis is similar to fludarabine-induced apoptosis in vitro. The combination of rolipram and fludarabine results in an enhancement in the number of apoptotic cells compared to apoptosis induced by either agent alone. Second, rolipram suppresses the expression of anti-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family and induces the pro-apoptotic protein Bax, thereby shifting the balance between pro- and anti-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family towards a pro-apoptotic direction. Finally rolipram-induced apoptosis is caspase-dependent. PDE 4 inhibitors are currently under investigation for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma in phase III clinical trials showing promising results with tolerable side-effects.

In 102 out of 127 patients (80%), cells at diagnosis displayed one or more leukemia-associated phenotypes (LAP), ie combinations of cell surface markers which are absent in normal cells and can thus be used to detect MRD at follow-up. Functional characterization of MRD cells for P-glycoprotein (Pgp) and multidrug resistance protein (MRP) activity is essential to investigate the role of these drug transport proteins in multidrug resistance in AML. A fluorescent probe assay using Syto16/PSC833 and calcein-AM/probenecid as substrate/modulator of the Pgp and MRP pump, respectively, and subsequent labeling of cells with monoclonal antibodies for LAP detection allowed simultaneous detection of LAP and Pgp or MRP activity. Validation of this assay is shown for 30 newly diagnosed AML and 11 MRD situations. In addition, no significant differences were found when comparing fresh and cryopreserved de novo AML for LAP expression (n = 43), Pgp (n = 30) and MRP (n = 24) function and for MRD samples for simultaneous LAP expression and Pgp/MRP activity (n = 10).

The aim of the present study was to analyze the activity of these proteins, which might be upregulated at relapse as compared with de novo AML due to clonal selection. The mRNA expression and activity of P-gp and the MRPs were determined with RT-PCR and flow cytometry, in conjunction with phenotype, as measured with the monoclonal antibodies CD34, CD38 and CD33, in 30 paired samples of de novo and relapsed AML. P-gp and MRP activity varied strongly between the cases (rhodamine 123 efflux-blocking by PSC833: 5.4+/-7.7, and carboxyfluorescein efflux-blocking by MK-571: 4.3+/-6.7, n = 60). P-gp and MRP activity were increased in 23% and 40% of the relapse samples, and decreased in 30% and 20% of the relapse samples, respectively (as defined by a difference of >2 x standard deviation of the assays). Up- or downregulation of mRNA expression was observed for MDR1 (40%), MRP1 (20%), MRP2 (15%), MRP3 (30%), and MRP5 (5%). Phenotyping demonstrated a more mature phenotype in 23% of the relapsed AML cases, and a more immature phenotype in 23% of the relapses, which was independent of the karyotypic changes that were observed in 50% of the studied cases. P-gp and MRP activity correlated with the phenotypic changes, with higher P-gp and MRP activities in less mature cells (r = -0.66, P < 0.001 and r = -0.31, P = 0.02, n = 58). In conclusion, this study shows that P-gp and MRP activity are not consistently upregulated in relapsed AML. However, P-gp and MRP activities were correlated with the maturation stage as defined by immune phenotype, which was observed to be different in 46% of the relapses.","['van der Kolk, D M', 'de Vries, E G', 'Noordhoek, L', 'van den Berg, E', 'van der Pol, M A', 'Muller, M', 'Vellenga, E']","['van der Kolk DM', 'de Vries EG', 'Noordhoek L', 'van den Berg E', 'van der Pol MA', 'Muller M', 'Vellenga E']","['Division of Hematology, University Hospital of Groningen, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (ABCC2 protein, human)', '0 (ABCC5 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Membrane Transport Proteins)', '0 (Multidrug Resistance-Associated Protein 2)', '0 (Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '1YV0492L5Z (multidrug resistance-associated protein 3)', 'Y49M64GZ4Q (multidrug resistance-associated protein 1)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/classification/*metabolism', '*Membrane Transport Proteins', 'Middle Aged', 'Multidrug Resistance-Associated Protein 2', 'Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Recurrence']",2001/10/06 10:00,2002/02/23 10:01,['2001/10/06 10:00'],"['2001/10/06 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/02/23 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/06 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2402236 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2001 Oct;15(10):1544-53. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402236.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Geldanamycin (GA), a drug which destabilizes Hsp90-associated proteins, depletes cells of Bcr-Abl, an Hsp90 client, but not of Abl. Both HL60 cells transfected with Bcr-Abl and naturally Ph1-positive K562 leukemia cells are resistant to most cytotoxic drugs, but were found to be sensitive to GA. Furthermore, GA sensitized Bcr-Abl-expressing cells to doxorubicin (DOX) and paclitaxel (PTX). In contrast, in parental HL60 cells, 90 nM GA inhibited PARP cleavage, nuclear fragmentation, and cell death caused by 500 ng/ml DOX. Like GA, STI 571 (an inhibitor of the Abl kinase) sensitized Bcr-Abl-expressing cells to DOX. Unlike GA, STI 571 did not antagonize the cytotoxic effects of DOX in parental HL60 cells. These results indicate that sensitization of Bcr-Abl-expressing cells, but not desensitization of HL60 cells, depends on inhibition of Bcr-Abl. Thus, GA differentially affects leukemia cells depending on their Bcr-Abl expression and selectively increases apoptosis in Bcr-Abl-expressing cells.","['Blagosklonny, M V', 'Fojo, T', 'Bhalla, K N', 'Kim, J S', 'Trepel, J B', 'Figg, W D', 'Rivera, Y', 'Neckers, L M']","['Blagosklonny MV', 'Fojo T', 'Bhalla KN', 'Kim JS', 'Trepel JB', 'Figg WD', 'Rivera Y', 'Neckers LM']","['Department of Developmental Therapeutics, Medicine Branch, National Cancer Institute, NIH, Bethesda and Rockville, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzoquinones)', '0 (HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Lactams, Macrocyclic)', '0 (Quinones)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)', 'Z3K3VJ16KU (geldanamycin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzoquinones', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Resistance', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/biosynthesis/*drug effects', 'HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Lactams, Macrocyclic', 'Leukemia/metabolism/*pathology', 'Paclitaxel/pharmacology', 'Quinones/*pharmacology', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",2001/10/06 10:00,2002/02/23 10:01,['2001/10/06 10:00'],"['2001/10/06 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/02/23 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/06 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2402257 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2001 Oct;15(10):1537-43. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402257.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have examined three human leukemia cell lines in vitro, treated with either daunorubicin, mitoxantrone, with or without cytosine arabinoside in the presence of dexrazoxane to determine whether such treatment would be synergistic or antagonistic. AML-193, CRF-SB, and Molt-4 cell lines were grown to confluence, plated into microtiter dishes and incubated for 72 h with varying concentrations of the above drugs. Cytotoxicity was determined by the MTT assay, and synergy or antagonism by median effect analysis. Dexrazoxane demonstrated additive or synergistic cytotoxic effects (CI <1) under most conditions. The triplet of daunorubicin, cytosine arabinoside, and dexrazoxane showed profound synergy in all three cell lines. These effects occurred at clinically achievable levels. If high dosages of anthracyclines are contemplated in this population, these preclinical data suggest that the addition of dexrazoxane to classical therapy is not antagonistic and thus may allow an investigation of the role of dexrazoxane as a cardiac protectant.","['Budman, D R', 'Calabro, A', 'Kreis, W']","['Budman DR', 'Calabro A', 'Kreis W']","['Don Monti Division of Oncology, North Shore University Hospital, New York University School of Medicine, Manhasset 11030, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Anthracyclines)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5AR83PR647 (Razoxane)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Anthracyclines/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/pharmacology', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology', 'Daunorubicin/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Drug Interactions', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Mitoxantrone/pharmacology', 'Razoxane/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",2001/10/06 10:00,2002/02/23 10:01,['2001/10/06 10:00'],"['2001/10/06 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/02/23 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/06 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2402244 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2001 Oct;15(10):1517-20. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402244.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

From August 1998 to December 2000 2-CdA was administered at a dosage of 0.12 mg/kg for 3 (CMC3) or 5 (CMC5) consecutive days, mitoxantrone at 10 mg/m2 on day 1 and cyclophosphamide at 650 mg/m2 on day 1 to 62 patients with advanced or progressive B-CLL. The cycles were repeated at 4 week intervals or longer if severe myelosuppression occurred. Twenty patients received CMC5 and 42 patients CMC3. Within the analyzed group an overall response (OR) rate (CR+PR) of 64.5% (95% CI: 52.7-76.3%) was reported, including 29.0% CR. There was no difference in the CR rate between the patients treated with CMC5 (30%) and CMC3 (28.6%) (P = 0.9), nor in the OR rate (55.0% and 69.0%, respectively, P = 0.3). Residual disease was identified in seven out of 18 (38.9%) patients who were in CR, including two treated with CMC5 and five treated with CMC3 protocols. CMC-induced grade III or IV thrombocytopenia occurred in 12 (19.4%) of patients, including four (20%) CMC5-treated and eight (19%) CMC3-treated patients (P= 0.8). Neutropenia grade III or IV was observed in seven (35%) and 11 (26.2%) patients, respectively (P = 0.8). Severe infections, including pneumonia and sepsis, occurred more frequently after CMC5 (11 patients, 55.0%) than CMC3 (10 patients, 28.6%) (P = 0.03) Fourteen patients died, including six treated with CMC5 and eight treated with CMC3 (30% and 19%, respectively). Infections were the cause of death in nine patients, including four in the CMC5 group and five in the CMC3 group. In conclusion, our results indicate that the CMC programme is an active combined regimen in previously untreated B-CLL patients; its efficiency seems to be similar to that observed earlier in B-CLL patients treated with 2-CdA as a single agent. However, toxicity, especially after CMC5 administration, is significant. Therefore, we recommend the CMC3 but not the CMC5 programme for further evaluation.","['Robak, T', 'Blonski, J Z', 'Kasznicki, M', 'Gora-Tybor, I', 'Dwilewicz-Trojaczek, J', 'Boguradzki, P', 'Konopka, L', 'Ceglarek, B', 'Sulek, J', 'Kuliczkowski, K', 'Wolowiec, D', 'Stella-Holowiecka, B', 'Skotnicki, A B', 'Nowak, W', 'Moskwa-Sroka, B', 'Dmoszynska, A', 'Calbecka, M']","['Robak T', 'Blonski JZ', 'Kasznicki M', 'Gora-Tybor I', 'Dwilewicz-Trojaczek J', 'Boguradzki P', 'Konopka L', 'Ceglarek B', 'Sulek J', 'Kuliczkowski K', 'Wolowiec D', 'Stella-Holowiecka B', 'Skotnicki AB', 'Nowak W', 'Moskwa-Sroka B', 'Dmoszynska A', 'Calbecka M']","['Department of Hematology, Medical University, Lodz, Poland.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage/toxicity', 'Cause of Death', 'Cladribine/administration & dosage/toxicity', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage/toxicity', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infections/chemically induced', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitoxantrone/administration & dosage/toxicity', 'Pancytopenia/chemically induced', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vomiting/chemically induced']",2001/10/06 10:00,2002/02/23 10:01,['2001/10/06 10:00'],"['2001/10/06 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/02/23 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/06 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2402216 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2001 Oct;15(10):1510-6. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402216.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They are vitamins, because retinol (vitamin A) is not synthesized in the body and must be derived from diet, but also hormones with intracrine activity, because retinol is transformed into molecules that bind to nuclear receptors, exhibit their activity, and are subsequently inactivated. Retinoids exert their effects on target cells by binding and activating nuclear retinoid receptors. Retinoid receptors bind their ligands in form of dimers. Heterodimers can be formed between two different retinoid receptor molecules but also between retinoid X receptors and the vitamin D receptor as well as the triiodothyronin receptor. This fact indicates complex interactions between retinoids and further hormonal signal transduction molecules. Interaction of retinoid receptors with transcriptional factors activated by other signal transduction mechanisms, e.g. AP-1, may provide dissociation of the retinoid effects. Retinoids can exhibit agonistic activity but also be neutral antagonists and inverse agonists. Topical and oral retinol, tretinoin, isotretinoin, and bexarotene, topical alitretinoin, retinaldehyde, motretinide, adapalene, tazarotene, and systemin acitretin compose the list of launched retinoids. Psoriasis and related disorders, congenital disorders of keratinization, acne, photoaging and hypovitaminosis A are classical approved indications of retinoid treatment, whereas cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, AIDS-associated Kaposi's sarcoma, acute promyelocytic leukemia and actinic lentigines were currently confirmed. In addition, retinoids have been successfully used in several other dermatoses, e.g. epithelial precanceroses and tumors, seborrhea, rosacea and acneiform dermatoses, lichen planus, eosinophilic folliculitis, condylomata accuminata, lichen sclerosus and atrophicus. Highly receptor selective molecules, retinoic acid receptor-beta-inducers, AP-1 complex antagonists, and inverse agonists will be probably lead the retinoid development in the near future. New, more effective and less toxic retinoids, alone or in combination with other drugs and new delivery systems may provide therapeutic solutions for benign and malignant proliferative skin diseases, such as psoriasis and non-melanoma tumors, cancer chemoprevention and differentiation therapy.","['Zouboulis, C C']",['Zouboulis CC'],"['Department of Dermatology, University Medical Center Benjamin Franklin, The Free University of Berlin, Berlin, Germany. zouboulis@medizin.fu-berlin.de']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Switzerland,Skin Pharmacol Appl Skin Physiol,Skin pharmacology and applied skin physiology,9807277,['0 (Retinoids)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Humans', 'Retinoids/agonists/*therapeutic use', 'Skin Diseases/diagnosis/*drug therapy']",2001/10/05 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/10/05 10:00'],"['2001/10/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/05 10:00 [entrez]']","['56361 [pii]', '10.1159/000056361 [doi]']",ppublish,Skin Pharmacol Appl Skin Physiol. 2001 Sep-Oct;14(5):303-15. doi: 10.1159/000056361.,"['Copyright 2001 S.

The ability to recruit SMRT appears to play a crucial role in leukemogenesis by the PML-retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARalpha) oncoprotein, an aberrant nuclear hormone receptor implicated in human acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). Arsenite induces clinical remission of APL through a incompletely understood mechanism. We report here that arsenite is a potent inhibitor of the interaction of SMRT with its transcription factor partners, including PML-RARalpha. Arsenite operates, in part, through a mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase cascade culminating in phosphorylation of the SMRT protein, dissociation of SMRT from its nuclear receptor partners, and a relocalization of SMRT out of the nucleus into the cytoplasm of the cell. Conversely, inhibition of this MAP kinase cascade attenuates the effects of arsenite on APL cells. Our results implicate SMRT as an important biological target for the actions of arsenite in both normal and neoplastic cells.","['Hong, S H', 'Yang, Z', 'Privalsky, M L']","['Hong SH', 'Yang Z', 'Privalsky ML']","['Section of Microbiology, Division of Biological Sciences, University of California at Davis, Davis, California 95616, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 DK053528/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA053394/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK-53528/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA-53394/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (NCOR2 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Receptor Co-Repressor 2)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (RARA protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/*metabolism', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Nuclear Receptor Co-Repressor 2', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Plasmids/metabolism', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Protein Binding', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/*metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha', 'Signal Transduction', 'Time Factors', 'Transfection', 'Two-Hybrid System Techniques']",2001/10/05 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/10/05 10:00'],"['2001/10/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/05 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/MCB.21.21.7172-7182.2001 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2001 Nov;21(21):7172-82. doi: 10.1128/MCB.21.21.7172-7182.2001.,,,,,PMC99892,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The fate of these radionuclides after cells are targeted with mAbs is important in terms of dosimetry and tumor detection. METHODS: In this study, we attached various radionuclides that result in alpha-emissions to T101, a rapidly internalizing anti-CD5 mAb. We then evaluated the catabolism and cellular retention and compared them with those of (125)I- and (111)In-labeled T101. T101 was labeled with (211)At, (125)I, (205,6)Bi, (111)In, and (203)Pb. CD5 antigen-positive cells, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNC), and MOLT-4 leukemia cells were used. The labeled T101 was incubated with the cells for 1 h at 4 degrees C for surface labeling. Unbound activity was removed and 1 mL medium added. The cells were then incubated at 37 degrees C for 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 24 h. The activity on the cell surface that internalized and the activity on the cell surface remaining in the supernatant were determined. The protein in the supernatant was further precipitated by methanol for determining protein-bound and non-protein-bound radioactivity. Sites of internal cellular localization of radioactivity were determined by Percoll gradient centrifugation. RESULTS: All radiolabeled antibodies bound to the cells were internalized rapidly. After internalization, (205,6)Bi, (203)Pb, and (111)In radiolabels were retained in the cell, with little decrease of cell-associated radioactivity. However, (211)At and (125)I were released from cells rapidly ((211)At < (125)I) and most of the radioactivity in the supernatant was in a non-protein-bound form. Intracellular distribution of radioactivity revealed a transit of the radiolabel from the cell surface to the lysosome. The catabolism patterns of MOLT-4 cells and PBMNC were similar. CONCLUSION: (211)At catabolism and release from cells were somewhat similar to that of (125)I, whereas (205,6)Bi and (203)Pb showed prolonged cell retention similar to that of (111)In. These catabolism differences may be important in the selection of alpha-radionuclides for radioimmunotherapy.","['Yao, Z', 'Garmestani, K', 'Wong, K J', 'Park, L S', 'Dadachova, E', 'Yordanov, A', 'Waldmann, T A', 'Eckelman, W C', 'Paik, C H', 'Carrasquillo, J A']","['Yao Z', 'Garmestani K', 'Wong KJ', 'Park LS', 'Dadachova E', 'Yordanov A', 'Waldmann TA', 'Eckelman WC', 'Paik CH', 'Carrasquillo JA']","['Department of Nuclear Medicine, Warren G.

Involvement of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway.,48997-9002,"Cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) has been reported to be commonly expressed in advanced stages of human lung adenocarcinoma. In this study, the COX-2 constitutive expression vector was transfected into a human lung adenocarcinoma cell line CL1.0 and several clones were obtained which stably expressed COX-2. These COX-2-overexpressed clones demonstrated remarkable resistance to apoptosis induced by Ultraviolet B (UVB) irradiation, vinblastine B (VBL) cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2), or other anti-cancer drugs. To understand how COX-2 prevents apoptosis, the investigators examined the expression level of Bcl-2 family members. Mcl-1, but not other Bcl-2 members, was significantly up-regulated by COX-2 transfection or prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) treatment. Treatment of COX-2-overexpressed cells (cox-2/cl.4) with two specific COX-2 inhibitors, NS-398 and celecoxib, caused an effective reduction of the increased level of Mcl-1. These data suggest that the expression level of Mcl-1 is tightly regulated by COX-2. Moreover, transfection of cox-2/cl.4 cells with antisense Mcl-1 enhanced apoptosis induced by UVB irradiation, revealing that Mcl-1 plays a crucial role in cell survival activity mediated by COX-2. Furthermore, COX-2 transfection or PGE(2) treatment evidently activated the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway. Inhibition of the PI3K pathway by LY294002 or wortmannin effectively attenuated the increased level of Mcl-1 induced by COX-2 or PGE(2). Blocking the PI3K activity with a dominant-negative vector, DN-p85, also greatly diminished the level of Mcl-1 and enhanced UVB-elicited cell death in cells transfected by COX-2. In a similar way, LY294002 inhibited cell survival and Mcl-1 level in PGE(2)-treated CL1.0 cells. These findings suggest that COX-2 promotes cell survival by up-regulating the level of Mcl-1 by activating the PI3K/Akt-dependent pathway.","['Lin, M T', 'Lee, R C', 'Yang, P C', 'Ho, F M', 'Kuo, M L']","['Lin MT', 'Lee RC', 'Yang PC', 'Ho FM', 'Kuo ML']","['Department of Surgery, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei 100, Taiwan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Androstadienes)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Culture Media, Serum-Free)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (Cyclooxygenase 1)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (Cyclooxygenase 2)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (PTGS1 protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (PTGS2 protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (AKT1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'XVA4O219QW (Wortmannin)']",IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/*physiopathology', 'Androstadienes/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Cell Survival', 'Culture Media, Serum-Free', 'Cyclooxygenase 1', 'Cyclooxygenase 2', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'In Situ Nick-End Labeling', 'Isoenzymes/genetics/*metabolism', 'Lung Neoplasms/*physiopathology', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthases/genetics/*metabolism', '*Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/physiology', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Up-Regulation', 'Vinblastine/pharmacology', 'Wortmannin']",2001/10/05 10:00,2002/02/01 10:01,['2001/10/05 10:00'],"['2001/10/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/02/01 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/05 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M107829200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(20)88137-X [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2001 Dec 28;276(52):48997-9002. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M107829200.

In the present studies, we analyzed expression of thioredoxin in samples from 28 children with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and analyzed their sensitivity toward inhibition of thioredoxin expression. Thioredoxin was expressed in variable amounts. Higher expression was associated with higher WBC counts. Exogenously added thioredoxin stimulated proliferation of clonogenic cells among the T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia samples expressing relatively lower levels of intracellular thioredoxin, whereas there was no effect on the clonogenic cells expressing high levels of thioredoxin. In addition, there was differential sensitivity of the leukemia clonogenic cells toward 1-methylpropyl 2-imidazolyl disulfide, an inhibitor of thioredoxin expression, as compared with normal hematopoietic progenitors.

Here we show that Notch signaling may be involved in prostatic development and cancer cell growth. In situ hybridization and reverse transcription-PCR analyses revealed that Notch1 was expressed in prostate epithelial cells during normal development and in prostate cancer cells. Characterization of Notch1-green fluorescent protein transgenic mice, in which the expression of reporter green fluorescent protein is under the control of the Notch1 promoter, indicated that Notch1-expressing cells were associated with the basal epithelial cell population in the prostate. Examination of the transgenic adenocarcinoma of the mouse prostate showed that expression of Notch1 was elevated in malignant prostatic epithelial cells of primary and metastatic tumors. Expression of Notch ligands, however, was low or undetectable in cultured prostate cancer cells or in malignant prostatic epithelial cells in transgenic adenocarcinoma of the mouse prostate. Furthermore, overexpression of a constitutively active form of Notch1 inhibited the proliferation of various prostate cancer cells, including DU145, LNCaP, and PC3 cells. Taken together, our data indicate for the first time that Notch signaling may play a role in murine prostatic development and tumorigenesis.","['Shou, J', 'Ross, S', 'Koeppen, H', 'de Sauvage, F J', 'Gao, W Q']","['Shou J', 'Ross S', 'Koeppen H', 'de Sauvage FJ', 'Gao WQ']","['Department of Molecular Oncology, Genentech, Inc., South San Francisco, California 94080, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (NOTCH1 protein, human)', '0 (Notch1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Notch1 protein, rat)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Division/physiology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics/*metabolism', 'Epithelial Cells/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Membrane Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics/physiology', 'Mice', 'Prostate/growth & development/*metabolism', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/genetics/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Receptor, Notch1', '*Receptors, Cell Surface', 'Signal Transduction/physiology', '*Transcription Factors']",2001/10/05 10:00,2001/10/19 10:01,['2001/10/05 10:00'],"['2001/10/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/19 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/05 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 2001 Oct 1;61(19):7291-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We demonstrated that indanocine specifically induces apoptosis in malignant B cells from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. To address the exact biochemical basis for indanocine toxicity, an indanocine-resistant clone was selected from mutagenized CEM human lymphoblastoid cells. The resistant cells displayed a stable indanocine-resistant phenotype for at least 9 months in drug-free culture. The cloned cells are cross-resistant to colchicine and vinblastine, but not to paclitaxel, and do not have increased expression of the multidrug-resistant p170 glycoprotein. In both parental cells and cell extracts, indanocine treatment caused tubulin depolymerization. In contrast, the tubulin in the resistant clone did not depolymerize under identical conditions. Both extract mixing and cell fusion experiments suggested that a stable structural change in microtubules, rather than a soluble factor, was responsible for indanocine resistance. Sequence analysis of parental and resistant cells revealed a single point mutation in the M40 isotype of beta-tubulin at nucleotide 1050 (G-->T, Lys(350)-->Asn) in the indanocine-resistant clone, in a region close to the putative colchicine binding site.","['Hua, X H', 'Genini, D', 'Gussio, R', 'Tawatao, R', 'Shih, H', 'Kipps, T J', 'Carson, D A', 'Leoni, L M']","['Hua XH', 'Genini D', 'Gussio R', 'Tawatao R', 'Shih H', 'Kipps TJ', 'Carson DA', 'Leoni LM']","['Department of Medicine and The Sam and Rose Stein Institute for Research on Aging, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, California 92093-0663, USA.']",['eng'],"['CA81534/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM23200/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Indans)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Tubulin)', '0 (indanocine)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)', 'SML2Y3J35T (Colchicine)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'B-Lymphocytes/drug effects/pathology', 'Cell Fusion', 'Cell-Free System', 'Colchicine/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/*genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Humans', 'Indans/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'Paclitaxel/pharmacology', 'Point Mutation', 'Protein Conformation', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Static Electricity', 'Tubulin/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Vinblastine/pharmacology']",2001/10/05 10:00,2001/10/19 10:01,['2001/10/05 10:00'],"['2001/10/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/19 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/05 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 2001 Oct 1;61(19):7248-54.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We studied 82 adults <60 years of age with primary AML and normal cytogenetics, who received uniform high-dose therapy and found FLT3 ITD in 23 (28%) patients. When the 23 FLT3 ITD+ cases were compared with the 59 cases with wild-type (WT) FLT3, disease-free survival (DFS) was inferior (P = 0.03), yet overall survival (OS) was not different (P = 0.14). However, 8 (35%) of 23 FLT3 ITD/+ cases also lacked a FLT3 WT allele (FLT3(ITD-R)) as determined by PCR and loss of heterozygosity. Thus, three genotypic groups were identified: normal FLT3(WT/WT), heterozygous FLT3(ITD/WT), and hemizygous FLT3(ITD/-). DFS and OS were significantly inferior for patients with FLT3(ITD/-) (P = 0.0017 and P = 0.0014, respectively). Although DFS and OS for FLT3(WT/WT) and FLT3(ITD/WT) groups did not differ (P = 0.32 and P = 0.98, respectively), OS of the FLT3(ITD/-) group was worse than the FLT3(WT/WT) (P = 0.0005) and FLT3(ITD/WT) (P = 0.008) groups. We propose a model in which FLT3(ITD/-) represents a dominant positive, gain-of-function mutation providing AML cells with a greater growth advantage compared with cells having the FLT3(WT/WT) or FLT3(ITD/WT) genotypes. In conclusion, we have identified the FLT3(ITD/-) genotype as an adverse prognostic factor in de novo AML with normal cytogenetics. A poor prognosis of the relatively young FLT3(ITD/-) adults (median age, 37 years), despite treatment with current dose-intensive regimens, suggests that new treatment modalities, such as therapy with a FLT3 tyrosine kinase inhibitor, are clearly needed for this group of patients.","['Whitman, S P', 'Archer, K J', 'Feng, L', 'Baldus, C', 'Becknell, B', 'Carlson, B D', 'Carroll, A J', 'Mrozek, K', 'Vardiman, J W', 'George, S L', 'Kolitz, J E', 'Larson, R A', 'Bloomfield, C D', 'Caligiuri, M A']","['Whitman SP', 'Archer KJ', 'Feng L', 'Baldus C', 'Becknell B', 'Carlson BD', 'Carroll AJ', 'Mrozek K', 'Vardiman JW', 'George SL', 'Kolitz JE', 'Larson RA', 'Bloomfield CD', 'Caligiuri MA']","['The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio 43210, USA.']",['eng'],"['CA09338/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA16058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA31946/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA3360/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA35279/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA41287/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA77658/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Alleles', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials, Phase I as Topic', 'Clinical Trials, Phase II as Topic', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', '*Gene Duplication', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*genetics', 'Tandem Repeat Sequences', 'Treatment Outcome', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3']",2001/10/05 10:00,2001/10/19 10:01,['2001/10/05 10:00'],"['2001/10/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/19 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/05 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 2001 Oct 1;61(19):7233-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The current work was undertaken to identify potential biochemical mechanisms of resistance to troxacitabine and to determine whether there are differences in resistance mechanisms between troxacitabine, gemcitabine, and cytarabine in human leukemic and solid tumor cell lines. The CCRF-CEM leukemia cell line was highly sensitive to the antiproliferative effects of troxacitabine, gemcitabine, and cytarabine with inhibition of proliferation by 50% observed at 160, 20, and 10 nM, respectively, whereas a deoxycytidine kinase (dCK)-deficient variant (CEM/dCK(-)) was resistant to all three drugs. In contrast, a nucleoside transport-deficient variant (CEM/ARAC8C) exhibited high levels of resistance to cytarabine (1150-fold) and gemcitabine (432-fold) but only minimal resistance to troxacitabine (7-fold). Analysis of troxacitabine transportability by the five molecularly characterized human nucleoside transporters [human equilibrative nucleoside transporters 1 and 2, human concentrative nucleoside transporter (hCNT) 1, hCNT2, and hCNT3] revealed that short- and long-term uptake of 10-30 microM [(3)H]troxacitabine was low and unaffected by the presence of either nucleoside transport inhibitors or high concentrations of nonradioactive troxacitabine. These results, which suggested that the major route of cellular uptake of troxacitabine was passive diffusion, demonstrated that deficiencies in nucleoside transport were unlikely to impart resistance to troxacitabine. A troxacitabine-resistant prostate cancer subline (DU145(R); 6300-fold) that exhibited reduced uptake of troxacitabine was cross-resistant to both gemcitabine (350-fold) and cytarabine (300-fold). dCK activity toward deoxycytidine in DU145(R) cell lysates was <20% of that in DU145 cell lysates, and no activity was detected toward troxacitabine. Sequence analysis of cDNAs encoding dCK revealed a mutation of a highly conserved amino acid (Trp(92)-->Leu) in DU145(R) dCK, providing a possible explanation for the reduced phosphorylation of troxacitabine in DU145(R) lysates. Reduced deamination of deoxycytidine was also observed in DU145(R) relative to DU145 cells, and this may have contributed to the overall resistance phenotype. These results, which demonstrated a different resistance profile for troxacitabine, gemcitabine, and cytarabine, suggest that troxacitabine may have an advantage over gemcitabine and cytarabine in human malignancies that lack or have low nucleoside transport activities.","['Gourdeau, H', 'Clarke, M L', 'Ouellet, F', 'Mowles, D', 'Selner, M', 'Richard, A', 'Lee, N', 'Mackey, J R', 'Young, J D', 'Jolivet, J', 'Lafreniere, R G', 'Cass, C E']","['Gourdeau H', 'Clarke ML', 'Ouellet F', 'Mowles D', 'Selner M', 'Richard A', 'Lee N', 'Mackey JR', 'Young JD', 'Jolivet J', 'Lafreniere RG', 'Cass CE']","['Shire BioChem Inc., Laval, Quebec, H7V 4A7 Canada. hgourdeau@ca.shire.com']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Dioxolanes)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Nucleoside Transport Proteins)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '0W860991D6 (Deoxycytidine)', '10028-17-8 (Tritium)', '60KQZ0388Y (troxacitabine)', '8J337D1HZY (Cytosine)', '9NEZ333N27 (Sodium)', 'B76N6SBZ8R (gemcitabine)', 'EC 2.7.1.74 (Deoxycytidine Kinase)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (Cytidine Deaminase)', 'WHI7HQ7H85 (Uridine)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Biological Transport', 'Carrier Proteins/metabolism', 'Cytarabine/pharmacokinetics', 'Cytidine Deaminase/metabolism', 'Cytosine/analogs & derivatives/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Deoxycytidine/analogs & derivatives/metabolism/pharmacokinetics', 'Deoxycytidine Kinase/deficiency/genetics/metabolism', 'Dioxolanes/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/enzymology/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Membrane Proteins/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nucleoside Transport Proteins', 'Phosphorylation', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/drug therapy/enzymology/*metabolism', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Sodium/metabolism', 'Stereoisomerism', 'Tritium', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Uridine/pharmacokinetics']",2001/10/05 10:00,2001/10/19 10:01,['2001/10/05 10:00'],"['2001/10/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/19 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/05 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 2001 Oct 1;61(19):7217-24.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Numerous studies have shown that overexpression of VEGF and its receptor plays an important role in tumor-associated angiogenesis and hence in both tumor growth and metastasis. We demonstrated previously that antagonistic antibodies to KDR specifically inhibited VEGF-stimulated receptor activation, cell migration, and endothelial cell mitogenesis. Here we constructed a recombinant bifunctional diabody that is capable of blocking both Flt-1 and KDR from binding to their ligands, including VEGF and placenta growth factor (PlGF). The diabody was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by single-step affinity chromatography. The diabody retained the capacity to bind both KDR and Flt-1 and effectively blocked interaction between KDR and VEGF, Flt-1 and VEGF, and Flt-1 and PlGF. Furthermore, the diabody is a stronger inhibitor than its parent antibodies to VEGF-stimulated mitogenesis of human endothelial cells, as well as both VEGF- and PlGF-induced migration of human leukemia cells. Taken together, our results suggest that dual receptor blockade with the bifunctional diabody may prove to be a more efficient approach in inhibiting VEGF-stimulated angiogenesis.","['Lu, D', 'Jimenez, X', 'Zhang, H', 'Wu, Y', 'Bohlen, P', 'Witte, L', 'Zhu, Z']","['Lu D', 'Jimenez X', 'Zhang H', 'Wu Y', 'Bohlen P', 'Witte L', 'Zhu Z']","['Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, ImClone Systems Inc., New York, New York 10014, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antibodies, Bispecific)', '0 (Endothelial Growth Factors)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Light Chains)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Growth Factor)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptors, Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-1)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Bispecific/genetics/*immunology/metabolism', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Movement/drug effects', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Endothelial Growth Factors/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Endothelium, Vascular/cytology', 'HL-60 Cells/cytology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics/immunology', 'Immunoglobulin Light Chains/genetics/immunology', 'Lymphokines/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*immunology/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/*immunology/metabolism', 'Receptors, Growth Factor/antagonists & inhibitors/*immunology/metabolism', 'Receptors, Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor', 'Recombinant Proteins/genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-1', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors']",2001/10/05 10:00,2001/10/19 10:01,['2001/10/05 10:00'],"['2001/10/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/19 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/05 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 2001 Oct 1;61(19):7002-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is therefore important to know if tumor cells can effectively and precisely cope not only with oxidatively induced DNA damage, but also with nuclear protein oxidation. In this study, we investigated the endogenous degradation of oxidatively damaged histones in K562 human leukemic cells after oxidative challenge and demonstrated a link to the overall cellular stress response pathways by poly-ADP-ribose-polymerase (PARP). After an oxidative challenge, endogenous nuclear protein degradation, as well as histone degradation, was enhanced. Among the histone fractions, histone H1 revealed the highest degradation rate, and more than 85% of the total degraded H1 disappeared in the first 30 min after oxidative challenge. Short-term degradation of histones up to 30 min, as well as long-term degradation up to 48 h after oxidative challenge, was significantly reduced in the presence of the PARP inhibitor 3-aminobenzamide, and nearly completely abrogated by the selective proteasome inhibitor lactacystin. Immunoprecipitation experiments indicated that the proteasome specifically degraded oxidized histones. Thus, we show that the nuclear proteosome system in tumor cells is capable of preventing the accumulation of oxidized proteins in this compartment and may suggest further treatment strategies to effectively interfere with the protein ""repair"" and replacement strategies of tumor cells.","['Ullrich, O', 'Grune, T']","['Ullrich O', 'Grune T']","['Dept. of Cell- and Neurobiology, Institute of Anatomy, Humboldt University Berlin, Schumannstrasse 20/21, D-10098 Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Free Radic Biol Med,Free radical biology & medicine,8709159,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Multienzyme Complexes)', '0 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase Inhibitors)', '133343-34-7 (lactacystin)', '26656-46-2 (Poly Adenosine Diphosphate Ribose)', '8J365YF1YH (3-aminobenzamide)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)', 'WYQ7N0BPYC (Acetylcysteine)']",IM,"['Acetylcysteine/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Benzamides/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/*metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Histones/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*metabolism', 'Multienzyme Complexes/*antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Oxidation-Reduction', '*Oxidative Stress', 'Poly Adenosine Diphosphate Ribose/metabolism', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase Inhibitors', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/*metabolism', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex']",2001/10/05 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/10/05 10:00'],"['2001/10/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/05 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0891584901006724 [pii]', '10.1016/s0891-5849(01)00672-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Free Radic Biol Med. 2001 Oct 1;31(7):887-93. doi: 10.1016/s0891-5849(01)00672-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Treating elderly patients with AML age-associated differences in the patients general presentation, such as physiological changes in organ function, decreased ability to react to stress, dependence in activities of daily living, existence of other morbidities (co-morbidity), the need to take drugs for those diseases and the reduced life expectancy can force alterations in the disease management. Clinical trials for the treatment of AML have been excluding elderly patients for years. Even trials accepting elderly patients with AML did select the group of otherwise healthy elderly patients for participation in the trial. Thus the data for AML management in elderly patients do not reflect the whole group of elderly patients with AML. If the patient is treated with curative intention, therapy of choice is the so-called 3 + 7 protocol for induction of complete remission, followed by a consolidation therapy and in some cases by maintenance therapy. In some situations, especially in very old patients, a palliative intention to treatment is favored. There are no generally accepted criteria to measure treatment benefit in this setting nor established chemotherapy protocols for this situation. Further trials for elderly patients with AML have to offer treatment options for the whole group of patients and have to determine what treatment approach is the best for which individual patient.","['Wedding, U', 'Hoffken, K']","['Wedding U', 'Hoffken K']","['Klinik fur Innere Medizin II Hamatologie, Onkologie, Endokrinologie, Stoffwechselerkrankungen Friedrich-Schiller-Universitat Erlanger Allee 101 07747 Jena, Germany. ulrich.wedding@med.uni-jena.de']",['ger'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Z Gerontol Geriatr,Zeitschrift fur Gerontologie und Geriatrie,9506215,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Geriatric Assessment', 'Germany/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Middle Aged', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Rate']",2001/10/05 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/10/05 10:00'],"['2001/10/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/05 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s003910170050 [doi]'],ppublish,Z Gerontol Geriatr. 2001 Aug;34(4):269-76. doi: 10.1007/s003910170050.,,,,Therapie der akuten myeloischen Leukamie beim alteren Patienten.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We retrospectively studied the APBSCT treatment efficacy and safety of patients at Tri-Service General Hospital (TSGH). METHODS: From January 1994 to March 2000, 11 patients were treated with high doses of chemotherapy/radiotherapy followed by APBSCT. Nine patients were male and 2 were female. The median age was 26 years, with a range of 21 to 51. There were 7 acute myeloid leukemia (AML), 3 non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and 1 ovarian cancer. All patients received both chemotherapy and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor to mobilize hematopoietic stem cells, and the most commonly used conditioning regimen was combined chemotherapy with Busulfan and Cyclophosphamide. RESULTS: The median numbers of infused mononuclear and CD34+ cells were 3.19 x 10(8)/kg and 9.2 x 10(6)/kg, respectively. Nine of the 11 patients engrafted successfully, but 2 patients with AML failed to engraft. The median times of WBC recovery (ANC > or = 500/uL) and platelet recovery (> or = 20 x 10(3)/uL) were 13 and 16 days, respectively. Four patients with AML survived after APBSCT and two of them were alive and disease-free for 36 and 51 months, respectively. One patient with AML and 3 patients with NHL died of relapse, and one patient with ovarian cancer was alive but with disease at 50 months. CONCLUSIONS: For patients with AML, APBSCT may be an alternative, safe and useful treatment modality. Further strategies for reducing relapse in lymphoma patients merit further investigation.","['Chen, Y C', 'Hsueh, E J', 'Ho, C L', 'Kao, W Y', 'Wan, H L', 'Chao, T Y']","['Chen YC', 'Hsueh EJ', 'Ho CL', 'Kao WY', 'Wan HL', 'Chao TY']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Ping-Tung Christian Hospital, Pingtung, Taiwan, R.O.C.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],China (Republic : 1949- ),Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi (Taipei),Zhonghua yi xue za zhi = Chinese medical journal; Free China ed,0005327,,IM,"['Adult', 'Female', 'Hematopoiesis', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*therapy', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",2001/10/05 10:00,2001/10/19 10:01,['2001/10/05 10:00'],"['2001/10/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/19 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/05 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi (Taipei). 2001 Jul;64(7):395-402.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we describe the medical histories of members of a family prone to MM. METHODS: We developed a pedigree for an MM-prone family by using information obtained from a questionnaire. Protein immunoelectrophoresis of serum and urine from the proband and from 19 family members was performed to detect monoclonal immunoproteins. Peripheral blood obtained from the proband and from five relatives was subjected to standard cytogenetic studies to detect constitutional chromosomal abnormalities. Multifluor-fluorescence in situ hybridization (M-FISH) and standard FISH studies were performed on peripheral blood from the proband and from two other affected living relatives to determine their karyotypes and to detect clonal chromosomal abnormalities frequently seen in patients with MM. RESULTS: Within this family, a sibship of seven included three individuals (including the proband) with histologically verified MM and two individuals with a monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance (MGUS), as determined by immunoelectrophoresis of serum and urine. This family also had members with acute lymphocytic leukemia, malignant melanoma, and prostate cancer. In the family members tested, we detected no constitutional chromosomal abnormality. None of the three individuals analyzed by FISH had a deletion of the retinoblastoma (Rb-1) locus, which is frequently deleted in patients with MM, and only one (the proband) had a translocation involving chromosomes 11 and 14, a clonal abnormality commonly seen in MM. CONCLUSION: The study of familial MM may provide insights into the pathogenesis and, ultimately, the control and prevention of MM and related disorders.","['Lynch, H T', 'Sanger, W G', 'Pirruccello, S', 'Quinn-Laquer, B', 'Weisenburger, D D']","['Lynch HT', 'Sanger WG', 'Pirruccello S', 'Quinn-Laquer B', 'Weisenburger DD']","['Department of Preventive Medicine, Creighton University School of Medicine, Omaha, NE 68178, USA. htlynch@creighton.edu']",['eng'],"['1U01CA86389-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA36727/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,['0 (Myeloma Proteins)'],IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/genetics', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11/ultrastructure', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14/ultrastructure', 'Female', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Karyotyping', 'Male', 'Melanoma/genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/epidemiology/*genetics/metabolism', 'Myeloma Proteins/analysis', 'Paraproteinemias/genetics', 'Pedigree', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/genetics', 'Risk', 'Skin Neoplasms/genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic']",2001/10/05 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/10/05 10:00'],"['2001/10/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/05 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/jnci/93.19.1479 [doi]'],ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 2001 Oct 3;93(19):1479-83. doi: 10.1093/jnci/93.19.1479.,,33,,,,"['J Natl Cancer Inst. 2002 Mar 20;94(6):461-2; author reply 463.

This methylation may perturb expression of genes critical to the regulation of cell proliferation. Aberrant methylation is not limited to a few genes or to promoter regions but has been found on a genome-wide scale in a variety of neoplasias, including colorectal cancer and acute myelogenous leukemia. Our goal was to characterize, in a quantitative manner, the profiles of abnormally methylated genes that may be specific for different cancers. METHODS: Using a quantitative assay, methylation-sensitive single nucleotide primer extension (MS-SNuPE), we have analyzed the methylation levels of promoter and exonic (coding region) CpG islands of two cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors [p15(INK4B) and p16(INK4A)] and the PAX6 gene, which encodes a transcriptional factor involved in neuronal proliferation, in DNA samples taken from patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia, acute myelogenous leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, and colorectal cancer. RESULTS: De novo methylation of all three exonic loci in tumors--relative to baseline levels found in nontumor tissue or blood--was observed in hematologic neoplasias and in solid tumors as well as in normal colonic tissue. However, methylation of promoter regions was more limited. Moreover, two different patterns of promoter methylation distinguished the leukemias from colorectal cancer: p15 promoter hypermethylation was found only in the leukemias, and p16 promoter hypermethylation occurred only in colon tumors. However, we did not address this issue prospectively; therefore, such an observation is only hypothesis generating. CONCLUSIONS: The methylation patterns that we observed suggest that exonic CpG islands are more susceptible to de novo methylation than promoter islands and that methylation may be seeded in exonic regions, from which it can spread to other islands, including promoter regions. Subsequent selection of cells with a growth advantage conferred by spread of methylation into and inactivation of a particular promoter might then contribute to the genesis of a specific type of cancer.","['Nguyen, C', 'Liang, G', 'Nguyen, T T', 'Tsao-Wei, D', 'Groshen, S', 'Lubbert, M', 'Zhou, J H', 'Benedict, W F', 'Jones, P A']","['Nguyen C', 'Liang G', 'Nguyen TT', 'Tsao-Wei D', 'Groshen S', 'Lubbert M', 'Zhou JH', 'Benedict WF', 'Jones PA']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Southern California/Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center, Keck School of Medicine of the USC, Los Angeles, USA.']",['eng'],"['P01CA55164/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R35CA49758/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,"['0 (CDKN2B protein, human)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Eye Proteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (PAX6 Transcription Factor)', '0 (PAX6 protein, human)', '0 (Paired Box Transcription Factors)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adenocarcinoma/genetics', 'Blast Crisis/genetics', 'Blood Cells/chemistry', 'Bone Marrow Cells/chemistry', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/genetics', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/genetics', '*CpG Islands', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16/genetics', '*DNA Methylation', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*chemistry', 'Exons', 'Eye Proteins', '*Genes, Homeobox', '*Genes, Tumor Suppressor', '*Genes, p16', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Accelerated Phase/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/genetics', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/genetics', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*chemistry', 'PAX6 Transcription Factor', 'Paired Box Transcription Factors', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Repressor Proteins', '*Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",2001/10/05 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/10/05 10:00'],"['2001/10/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/05 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/jnci/93.19.1465 [doi]'],ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 2001 Oct 3;93(19):1465-72. doi: 10.1093/jnci/93.19.1465.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PML has growth-suppressive properties and is localized within distinct nuclear structures referred to as nuclear bodies. PML participates in numerous cellular functions, including transcriptional activation, apoptosis, and transcriptional repression, whereas PML-RARalpha blocks these functions. However, the role played by PML-RARalpha in leukemogenesis remains unclear. Here we report that PML is required for transcriptional repression mediated by the tumor suppressor Rb. Rb interacts with the histone decaetylase (HDAC) complex containing co-repressors and represses the transcription of the E2F target genes. Overexpression of PML enhanced Rb-mediated repression. The degree of Rb-mediated repression was weakened by injecting anti-PML antibodies and was lower in Pml-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts. PML-RARalpha inhibited Rb-mediated repression, and two co-repressor-interacting sites on the PML-RARalpha molecule were required for this activity. Furthermore, PML-RARalpha blocked the interaction between Rb and HDAC. Thus, aberrant binding of PML-RARalpha to co-repressor-HDAC complexes may inhibit their association with Rb, resulting in the abrogation of Rb activity. Thus, the disruption of Rb-mediated repression may be a contributory factor in leukemogenesis.","['Khan, M M', 'Nomura, T', 'Kim, H', 'Kaul, S C', 'Wadhwa, R', 'Zhong, S', 'Pandolfi, P P', 'Ishii, S']","['Khan MM', 'Nomura T', 'Kim H', 'Kaul SC', 'Wadhwa R', 'Zhong S', 'Pandolfi PP', 'Ishii S']","['Laboratory of Molecular Genetics, RIKEN Tsukuba Institute, 3-1-1 Koyadai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-0074, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (E2F Transcription Factors)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cell Line', '*DNA-Binding Proteins', 'E2F Transcription Factors', 'Histone Deacetylases/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism/*physiology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/metabolism/*physiology', 'Protein Binding', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/metabolism/*physiology', 'Transcription Factors/genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic/*physiology']",2001/10/05 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/10/05 10:00'],"['2001/10/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/05 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.C100532200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)82769-2 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2001 Nov 23;276(47):43491-4. doi: 10.1074/jbc.C100532200.

We detected significant changes in the gene expression of NK-YS cell line: an increase in 18 and a decrease in 20 genes compared to normal NK cells or peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Among these genes, we found a strong decrease in hematopoietic cell specific protein-tyrosine-phosphatase SH-PTP1 (SHP1) mRNA by cDNA expression array and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Further analysis with standard immunohistochemistry and tissue microarray, which used 207 paraffin-embedded specimens of various kinds of malignant lymphomas, showed that 100% of NK/T lymphoma specimens and more than 95% of various types of malignant lymphoma were negative for SHP1 protein expression. On the other hand, SHP1 protein was strongly expressed in the mantle zone and interfollicular zone lymphocytes in reactive lymphoid hyperplasia specimens. In addition, various kinds of hematopoietic cell lines, particularly the highly aggressive lymphoma/leukemia lines, lacked SHP1 expression in vitro, suggesting that loss of SHP1 expression may be related to not only malignant transformation, but also tumor cell aggressiveness. SHP1 expression could not be induced in either of two NK/T cell lines by phorbol ester, suggesting that genetic impairment or modification with methylation of SHP1 DNA could be one of the critical events in the pathogenesis of NK/T lymphoma. This evidence strongly suggests that loss of SHP1 gene expression plays an important role in multistep tumorigenesis, possibly as an anti-oncogene in the wide range of lymphomas/leukemias as well as NK/T lymphomas.","['Oka, T', 'Yoshino, T', 'Hayashi, K', 'Ohara, N', 'Nakanishi, T', 'Yamaai, Y', 'Hiraki, A', 'Sogawa, C A', 'Kondo, E', 'Teramoto, N', 'Takahashi, K', 'Tsuchiyama, J', 'Akagi, T']","['Oka T', 'Yoshino T', 'Hayashi K', 'Ohara N', 'Nakanishi T', 'Yamaai Y', 'Hiraki A', 'Sogawa CA', 'Kondo E', 'Teramoto N', 'Takahashi K', 'Tsuchiyama J', 'Akagi T']","['Department of Pathology, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine and Dentistry, Okayama, Japan. oka@md.okayama-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Pathol,The American journal of pathology,0370502,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['DNA, Complementary/genetics', '*Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*enzymology', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*pathology', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Lymphoma/*genetics/*pathology', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Pseudolymphoma/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Reference Values', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/10/05 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/10/05 10:00'],"['2001/10/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/05 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0002-9440(10)62535-7 [pii]', '10.1016/S0002-9440(10)62535-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Pathol. 2001 Oct;159(4):1495-505. doi: 10.1016/S0002-9440(10)62535-7.,,,,,PMC1850490,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Human polyamine-modulated factor-1 (hPMF-1) was the first polyamine-responsive transcription factor identified. Here the mouse homologue of the hPMF-1 gene is described. Interestingly, the mouse gene (mPMF-1) codes for two alternatively spliced mRNAs. Both of the mouse splice variants, mPMF-1S and mPMF-1L, possess C-terminal coiled-coil domains nearly identical to that found in hPMF-1 and are highly homologous with the human protein. The C-terminal coiled-coil structure is necessary for transcriptional activation. However, the shorter protein, mPMF-1S, does not contain an N-terminal coiled-coil region as do both hPMF-1 and the longer mPMF-1L. mPMF-1L mRNA codes for a protein of 202 amino acids, 37 amino acids longer than the human protein. By contrast, mPMF-1S codes for only 133 amino acids, as a result of two exons being omitted compared with mPMF-1L. Both mouse transcription factors can interact with Nrf-2 (nuclear factor-E2-related factor 2), the normal partner of hPMF-1, substantiating the importance of the C-terminal coiled-coil region responsible for this interaction. Finally, the expression of mPMF-1 is induced when mouse M1 myeloid leukaemia cells are exposed to polyamine analogues, suggesting control similar to that observed for the hPMF-1.","['Wang, Y', 'Devereux, W', 'Woster, P M', 'Casero, R A Jr']","['Wang Y', 'Devereux W', 'Woster PM', 'Casero RA Jr']","['The Johns Hopkins Oncology Center, Bunting Blaustein Cancer Research Building, Room 551, 1650 Orleans Street, Baltimore, MD 21231, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA085509/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA51085/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA58184/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA85509/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['0 (Biogenic Polyamines)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (GA-Binding Protein Transcription Factor)', '0 (PMF1 protein, human)', '0 (Pmf1 protein, mouse)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Alternative Splicing', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Biogenic Polyamines/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'GA-Binding Protein Transcription Factor', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Liver/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Rabbits', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Species Specificity', 'Transcription Factors/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic']",2001/10/05 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/10/05 10:00'],"['2001/10/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/05 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1042/0264-6021:3590387 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochem J. 2001 Oct 15;359(Pt 2):387-92. doi: 10.1042/0264-6021:3590387.,,,,,PMC1222158,,,,"['GENBANK/AF348509', 'GENBANK/AF348510', 'GENBANK/AF348511', 'GENBANK/AF348512']",,,,,,,,,,,

The minor shifts in B-ALL were observed most frequently and concerned of the loss of CD34 antigen in 17 cases and the loss of cALLA (CD10) in 7 cases of B-ALL at the first relapse. The acquisition of cell markers was not frequently observed, only in four cases could be seen. HLA-DR molecules remained relatively constant from diagnosis to relapse. In 2 from 3 T-ALL cases the loss of CD1 and CD2 markers, respectively, was noticed at relapse. CD5 and CD7 markers were relatively stable. In AML cases at relapse the acquisition of CD13 marker (in 4 from 7 cases) was often observed. It was interesting that comparing to the B-ALL cases, the loss of CD34 marker in AML cases was stray. In one case the acquisition of this antigen at relapse was actually observed. The major interlineage shift was detected in one case of B-ALL, that was newly diagnosed at relapse as AML M4 and presented different cytogenetic features. This case provides strong connection with the treatment, as more recently epipodophyllotoxins (vumon in our patient) have been linked to the development of secondary AML associated with a shorter latency period. The immunophenotypic changes frequently occur at relapse in all acute leukemia types. The shifts (loss or acquisition) in expression of individual markers at relapse are bound with the first diagnosis and may have a relationship to the treatment and are important for correct assessment of minimal residual disease.","['Tomova, A', 'Babusikova, O']","['Tomova A', 'Babusikova O']","['Cancer Research Institute, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Bratislava, Slovak Republic. exontoma@savba.sk']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Slovakia,Neoplasma,Neoplasma,0377266,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antigens, CD/blood', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*immunology', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/immunology', 'Child', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*immunology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/immunology', 'Male', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*immunology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*immunology', 'Recurrence']",2001/10/05 10:00,2001/10/19 10:01,['2001/10/05 10:00'],"['2001/10/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/19 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/05 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Neoplasma. 2001;48(3):164-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Evaluation of costs and savings, using historical control data. SETTING: Adult oncology unit of a 650-bed hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Patients with leukemia, lymphoma, and solid tumors, excluding bone marrow transplant recipients. METHODS: Costs and savings with estimated ranges were calculated. Excess length of stay (LOS) associated with VRE bloodstream infection (BSI) was determined by matching VRE BSI patients with VRE-negative patients by oncology diagnosis. Differences in LOS between the matched groups were evaluated using a mixed-effect analysis of variance linear-regression model. RESULTS: The cost of enhanced infection control strategies for 1 year was $116,515. VRE BSI was associated with an increased LOS of 13.7 days. The savings associated with fewer VRE BSI ($123,081), fewer patients with VRE colonization ($2,755), and reductions in antimicrobial use ($179,997) totaled $305,833. Estimated ranges of costs and savings for enhanced infection control strategies were $97,939 to $148,883 for costs and $271,531 to $421,461 for savings. CONCLUSION: The net savings due to enhanced infection control strategies for 1 year was $189,318. Estimates suggest that these strategies would be cost-beneficial for hospital units where the number of patients with VRE BSI is at least six to nine patients per year or if the savings from fewer VRE BSI patients in combination with decreased antimicrobial use equalled $100,000 to $150,000 per year.","['Montecalvo, M A', 'Jarvis, W R', 'Uman, J', 'Shay, D K', 'Petrullo, C', 'Horowitz, H W', 'Wormser, G P']","['Montecalvo MA', 'Jarvis WR', 'Uman J', 'Shay DK', 'Petrullo C', 'Horowitz HW', 'Wormser GP']","['Division of Infectious Diseases, New York Medical College, Valhalla 10595, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol,Infection control and hospital epidemiology,8804099,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '6Q205EH1VU (Vancomycin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Bacteremia/drug therapy/economics/*prevention & control', 'Cost Control', 'Cost Savings', 'Cross Infection/drug therapy/economics/*prevention & control', 'Enterococcus/*drug effects/isolation & purification', 'Gram-Positive Bacterial Infections/drug therapy/economics/*prevention & control', 'Hospital Bed Capacity, 500 and over', 'Hospital Costs/*statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Infection Control/*economics/methods', 'Length of Stay/economics', 'New York', 'Oncology Service, Hospital/*economics', 'Vancomycin/pharmacology/therapeutic use', '*Vancomycin Resistance']",2001/10/05 10:00,2002/01/12 10:01,['2001/10/05 10:00'],"['2001/10/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/12 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/05 10:00 [entrez]']","['ICHE6847 [pii]', '10.1086/501931 [doi]']",ppublish,Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol. 2001 Jul;22(7):437-42. doi: 10.1086/501931.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Whether the higher cytogenetic response rates are also associated with a significant improvement of survival still remains controversial. The different results obtained from large randomised and observational trials may be due to the numbers of patients enrolled, distribution of risk profiles and the treatment schedule, which is influenced greatly by the haematological and gastrointestinal toxicity of AraC. An oral formulation (YNK01), which is lipophilic and resistant to deamination, is currently under investigation. Clinically, it has similar activity, but toxicity leads to discontinuation of treatment in a considerable proportion of patients. The clinical benefits may therefore be outweighed by the dose-limiting toxicity for both application forms.

The aim of this study was to determine the role of the Epo-R mediated signalling in the rise of MDS and whether alteration of signalling pathways contribute to the leukeamogenesis from MDS to acute leukaemia. We analysed Epo and GM-CSF induced ERK1/2 activation, c-Fos expression, STAT-5 and AP-1 DNA binding activities in mononuclear cells of umbilical cord blood (UCBMNC), normal marrow (NBMMNC) or marrow with MDS, AML with prior MDS and de novo AML. In UCBMNC and NBMMNC, Epo and GM-CSF induced the activation of STAT-5 DNA binding and ERK 1/2 activation (n = 6). In contrast, in MDS RA, both signalling pathways were activated only by GM-CSF but not by Epo (n = 7). In acute leukaemia, elevated basal activity of STAT-5 DNA binding appeared in 8/8 cases, which was independent of Epo or GM-CSF treatment. In normal and MDS samples, c-Fos and Egr-1 proteins were not detectable and the expression levels were not increased by Epo or GM-CSF treatment. In contrast, we found an elevated level of c-Fos expression in 5/8 acute leukemia cases, which was not further increased in the presence of Epo or GM-CSF. The elevated c-Fos expression was accompanied by an extremely high blast number in 5/5 cases. These results suggest that impaired ERK/MAPK activation, similarly to impaired STAT-5 activation in Epo-R signalling, may be responsible for the apoptotic process and the block of maturation in MDS RA. The results also suggest that the appearance of the constitutively activated STAT-5 DNA binding and c-Fos expression may be used as a predictor of the blastic transformation.","['Kolonics, A', 'Apati, A', 'Nahajevszky, S', 'Gati, R', 'Brozik, A', 'Magocsi, M']","['Kolonics A', 'Apati A', 'Nahajevszky S', 'Gati R', 'Brozik A', 'Magocsi M']","['Department of Cell Metabolism, National Institute of Haematology and Immunology, Budapest, Hungary.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Haematologia (Budap),Haematologia,0130266,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Milk Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Marrow Cells/pathology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation/*drug effects/physiology', 'Erythropoietin/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/enzymology/*etiology/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Milk Proteins', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/enzymology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Phenotype', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos/metabolism', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/*physiology', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism']",2001/10/05 10:00,2002/09/27 06:00,['2001/10/05 10:00'],"['2001/10/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/27 06:00 [medline]', '2001/10/05 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1163/15685590152492936 [doi]'],ppublish,Haematologia (Budap). 2001;31(2):125-38. doi: 10.1163/15685590152492936.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

NF-kappaB is a transcription factor that participates in the transcriptional activation of a variety of immune and inflammatory genes. We investigated whether ts1 activates NF-kappaB in astrocytes and examined the mechanism(s) responsible for the activation of NF-kappaB by ts1 infection in vitro. Here we present evidence that ts1 infection of astrocytes in vitro activates NF-kappaB by enhanced proteolysis of the NF-kappaB inhibitors, IkappaBalpha and IkappaBbeta. In in vitro studies using protease inhibitors, IkappaBalpha proteolysis in ts1-infected astrocytes was significantly blocked by a specific calpain inhibitor calpeptin but not by MG-132, a specific proteasome inhibitor, whereas rapid IkappaBbeta proteolysis was blocked by MG-132. Furthermore, treatment with MG-132 increased levels of multiubiquitinated IkappaBbeta protein in ts1-infected astrocytes. These results indicate that the calpain proteolysis is a major mechanism of IkappaBalpha proteolysis in ts1-infected astrocytes.

The gp46 surface glycoprotein binds to a poorly characterized cell surface receptor, thereby promoting the gp21-dependent fusion of the viral and cellular membranes. Interestingly, a synthetic peptide (P-197) simulating amino acids 197 to 216 of gp46 strongly inhibits envelope-dependent membrane fusion with Molt-4 target cells. It has been suggested that this peptide acts by competitively binding to Hsc70, a putative cellular receptor for HTLV-1. We now demonstrate that P-197 inhibits membrane fusion among diverse HTLV-1-permissive target cells. Importantly, most of these cells lack detectable levels of Hsc70, indicating that P-197 inhibits membrane fusion by a mechanism that is Hsc70 independent. We now suggest that competition for primary receptor binding is unlikely to account for the inhibitory activity of P-197. Understanding the mechanism by which P-197 functions may reveal concepts of general relevance to antiretroviral chemotherapy.","['Brighty, D W', 'Jassal, S R']","['Brighty DW', 'Jassal SR']","['Biomedical Research Centre, Ninewells Hospital and Medical School, University of Dundee, Dundee DD1 9SY, Scotland, UK.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (HSC70 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (HSPA8 protein, human)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '0 (gp46 protein, Human T-cell leukemia virus type I)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Gene Products, env/*pharmacology', 'HSC70 Heat-Shock Proteins', 'HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins/*physiology', 'HeLa Cells', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Membrane Fusion/*drug effects', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Peptide Fragments/*pharmacology', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/*pharmacology']",2001/10/03 10:00,2001/10/26 10:01,['2001/10/03 10:00'],"['2001/10/03 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/26 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/03 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.75.21.10472-10478.2001 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2001 Nov;75(21):10472-8. doi: 10.1128/JVI.75.21.10472-10478.2001.,,,,,PMC114622,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In analogy to the Rev and Rex proteins, which have distinct RNA binding sites in their responsive elements, we have proposed that Rec may also have a defined binding site in the RcRE. In this report, we demonstrate that not every HTDV/HERV-K copy present in the human genome contains an active RcRE, and we characterize mutations that abrogate Rec function. In addition, we demonstrate that Rec function requires binding to a complex, folded RNA structure rather than binding to a discrete specific binding site, in contrast to Rev and Rex and their homologous responsive elements. We define four stem-loop structures in the RcRE that are essential for Rec function. Finally, we demonstrate that both Rev and Rex can mediate nuclear export through the RcRE but that their binding sites are different from each other and from that of Rec.","['Magin-Lachmann, C', 'Hahn, S', 'Strobel, H', 'Held, U', 'Lower, J', 'Lower, R']","['Magin-Lachmann C', 'Hahn S', 'Strobel H', 'Held U', 'Lower J', 'Lower R']","['Paul-Ehrlich-Institut, D-63225 Langen, Germany.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Gene Products, rev)', '0 (Gene Products, rex)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Endogenous Retroviruses/*genetics', 'Gene Products, rev/physiology', 'Gene Products, rex/physiology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'RNA/*chemistry/metabolism', '*Response Elements', 'Retroviridae Proteins/*physiology', 'Terminal Repeat Sequences']",2001/10/03 10:00,2001/10/26 10:01,['2001/10/03 10:00'],"['2001/10/03 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/26 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/03 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.75.21.10359-10371.2001 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2001 Nov;75(21):10359-71. doi: 10.1128/JVI.75.21.10359-10371.2001.,,,,,PMC114610,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PIR-B coligation with the IgE receptor (FcepsilonRI) inhibited IgE-mediated mast cell activation and release of serotonin. Surprisingly, the inhibitory activity of PIR-B was unimpaired in SHP-1-deficient mast cells. A third functional tyrosine-based inhibitory motif, one that fails to bind the SHP-1, SHP-2, and SHIP phosphatases, was identified in parallel studies of FcepsilonRI-bearing rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) cells transfected with constructs having mutations in the PIR-B cytoplasmic region.

In Japan, the efficacy of HDAC needs to be evaluated under a good clinical trial. Stem cell source for HSCT has been expanded, and the number of peripheral blood stem cell transplantations is greater than that of bone marrow transplantation, especially for auto-transplantation. Despite some randomized clinical trials, we still do not know whether HSCT provides longer survival than chemotherapy for patients with AML when performed during their first remission. Differentiation therapy for acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) using ATRA showed clear success in the treatment for AML. APL is stratified with its specific karyotype and morphology, and this stratification leads to the improvement of overall survival of patients with APL. Several clinical study groups in the world have studied prognostic factors and it has been shown that the chromosomal abnormality of AML cells is closely related to the response to the chemotherapy. The stratification of AML using these prognostic factors is incorporated in some clinical trials to determine whether this approach actually leads to better survival for patients with AML.","['Miyazaki, Y', 'Kuriyama, K']","['Miyazaki Y', 'Kuriyama K']","['Department of Hematology, Molecular Medicine Unit, Nagasaki University School of Medicine, 1-12-4 Sakamoto, Nagasaki 852-8523, Japan.']",['jpn'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Japan,Gan To Kagaku Ryoho,Gan to kagaku ryoho.

The prototypic member, PBX1, was first identified in chromosomal translocations in B-lineage leukemia and is required for normal hematopoiesis. PBX2 and PBX3 were later identified as members of this highly conserved family by their strong homology to PBX1. While the expression pattern of PBX1 is restricted, PBX2 and PBX3 are ubiquitously expressed. Little is known about the functional role of PBX3. Our studies identified two PBX3 transcripts alternative to the canonical forms, PBX3A and PBX3B, resulting from a novel splice in PBX3. These new isoforms, named PBX3C and PBX3D, have been detected in all tissues and cell lines tested. Intriguingly, expression of PBX3D is favored in normal cells, whereas PBX3C expression is favored in leukemia cells. Functional studies showed that PBX3C and PBX3D proteins were unable to interact with the PBX-interacting factor PREP1 and weakly interacted with MEIS proteins. We propose that PBX3C and PBX3D may affect PBX3-mediated transcriptional regulation by acting in opposition to the known PBX proteins through alternative PBX3 complex formation.

Screening of a cDNA library of the patient's leukemic cells showed a novel fusion transcript between MLL and the Gephyrin (GPHN) gene on 14q24. The resulting MLL-GPHN fusion gene encodes MLL AT hook motifs and a DNA methyltransferase homology domain fused to the C-terminal half of Gephyrin, including a presumed tubulin binding site and a domain homologous to the Escherichia coli molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis protein MoeA. Genomic breakpoint analysis showed potential in vitro topoisomerase-II DNA-binding sites spanning the breakpoints in both MLL and GPHN but no flanking sequences that might mediate homologous recombination. This suggests that MLL-GPHN may have been generated by VP 16/topoisomerase-II-induced DNA double-strand breaks, followed by error-prone DNA repair via non-homologous end joining. Gephyrin was originally identified as a submembraneous scaffold protein that anchors and immobilizes postsynaptic membrane neurotransmitter receptors to underlying cytoskeletal elements. It also is reported to bind to phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate binding proteins involved in actin dynamics and downstream signaling and interacts with ATM-related family member RAFT1. Gephyrin domains in the chimeric protein therefore could contribute novel signal sequences or might modify MLL activity by oligomerization or intracellular redistribution.","['Eguchi, M', 'Eguchi-Ishimae, M', 'Seto, M', 'Morishita, K', 'Suzuki, K', 'Ueda, R', 'Ueda, K', 'Kamada, N', 'Greaves, M']","['Eguchi M', 'Eguchi-Ishimae M', 'Seto M', 'Morishita K', 'Suzuki K', 'Ueda R', 'Ueda K', 'Kamada N', 'Greaves M']","['Leukaemia Research Fund Centre, Institute of Cancer Research, London, United Kingdom. maeguchi@icr.ac.uk']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (gephyrin)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Carrier Proteins/*genetics', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosome Breakage/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14/*genetics', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Female', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/*genetics', 'Membrane Proteins/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', '*Proto-Oncogenes', '*Transcription Factors', '*Translocation, Genetic']",2001/10/02 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/10/02 10:00'],"['2001/10/02 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/02 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/gcc.1185 [pii]', '10.1002/gcc.1185 [doi]']",ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2001 Nov;32(3):212-21. doi: 10.1002/gcc.1185.,"['Copyright 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Analysis of 27 patients.,161-5,"BACKGROUND: Pulmonary mycetoma is a characteristic clinical-radiological lesion due to colonization of aspergillus or candida species in pre-existing pulmonary cavities following a number of diseases. METHODS: We revisited 27 records of such admitted patients (19 M, 8 F; range age 16-27 yrs) analysing diagnostic approach and therapy. Predisposing conditions were sequelae of tuberculosis or lung abscess, bronchiectasis, bullous emphysema, leukaemia/ lymphoma, diabetes mellitus, corticosteroids and/or immunosuppressant administration and antiblastic chemotherapy. All patients had a characteristic chest X-ray and the most common symptoms were cough and haemoptysis. Diagnosis of pulmonary mycetoma was based on positive sputum culture for aspergillus or candida species and/or positive result for aspergillus precipitin test. Eleven patients received only medical treatment, eight pts only a surgical one and eight patients both medical and surgical ones. Antifungal drugs administered were itraconazole or amphotericin B or fluconazole. RESULTS: In the follow-up, six out of eleven patients who had received only medical treatment, cannot be found; five patients or their relatives were interviewed by phone: two of them enjoyed good health and three had died. Sixteen patients underwent thoracic surgery and one of them died because of postsurgical complications. In the follow-up, only nine patients out of this last group were interviewed by phone 2 to 8 years after surgery: seven of them enjoyed good health while two patients had died because of disease not related to pulmonary mycetoma. CONCLUSIONS: Aspergilloma treatment is related to the extension of disease and clinical conditions of patients but surgical resection associated with drug administration, when possible, is the treatment of choice.","['Mariotta, S', 'Giuffreda, E', 'Tramontano, F', 'Treggiari, S', 'Ricci, A', 'Schmid, G']","['Mariotta S', 'Giuffreda E', 'Tramontano F', 'Treggiari S', 'Ricci A', 'Schmid G']","['Section of Respiratory Diseases, Department of Respiratory and Cardiovascular Sciences, University La Sapienza, Rome, Italy. salvatore.mariotta@uniroma1.it']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Italy,Panminerva Med,Panminerva medica,0421110,['0 (Antifungal Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antifungal Agents/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lung Diseases, Fungal/diagnostic imaging/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mycetoma/diagnostic imaging/*therapy', 'Radiography, Thoracic']",2001/10/02 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/10/02 10:00'],"['2001/10/02 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/02 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Panminerva Med. 2001 Sep;43(3):161-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The effects of the IP(3)-receptor antagonist 2-aminoethyldiphenyl borate (2-APB) on the Ca(2+) release-activated Ca(2+) current (I(CRAC)) in Jurkat human T cells, DT40 chicken B cells and rat basophilic leukaemia (RBL) cells were examined. 2. 2-APB elicited both stimulatory and inhibitory effects on Ca(2+) influx through CRAC channels. At concentrations of 1-5 microM, 2-APB enhanced Ca(2+) entry in intact cells and increased I(CRAC) amplitude by up to fivefold. At levels > or = 10 microM, 2-APB caused a transient enhancement of I(CRAC) followed by inhibition. 3. 2-APB altered the kinetics of fast Ca(2+)-dependent inactivation of I(CRAC). At concentrations of 1-5 microM, 2-APB increased the rate of fast inactivation. In contrast, 2-APB at higher concentrations (> or = 10 microM) reduced or completely blocked inactivation. 4. 2-APB inhibited Ca(2+) efflux from mitochondria. 5. 2-APB inhibited I(CRAC) more potently when applied extracellularly than intracellularly. Furthermore, increased protonation of 2-APB at low pH did not affect potentiation or inhibition. Thus, 2-APB may have an extracellular site of action. 6. Neither I(CRAC) activation by passive store depletion nor the effects of 2-APB were altered by intracellular dialysis with 500 microg ml(-1) heparin. 7. I(CRAC) is present in wild-type as well as mutant DT40 B cells lacking all three IP(3) receptor isoforms. 2-APB also potentiates and inhibits I(CRAC) in both cell types, indicating that 2-APB exerts its effects independently of IP(3) receptors. 8. Our results show that CRAC channel activation does not require physical interaction with IP(3) receptors as proposed in the conformational coupling model. Potentiation of I(CRAC) by 2-APB may be a useful diagnostic feature for positive identification of putative CRAC channel genes, and provides a novel tool for exploring the physiological functions of store-operated channels.","['Prakriya, M', 'Lewis, R S']","['Prakriya M', 'Lewis RS']","['Department of Molecular and Cellular Physiology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 GM045374/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 GM045374/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'GM45374/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,J Physiol,The Journal of physiology,0266262,"['0 (Boron Compounds)', '0 (Calcium Channels)', '0 (ITPR1 protein, human)', '0 (Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate Receptors)', '0 (Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear)', 'E4ES684O93 (2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Boron Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Calcium Channels/*metabolism', 'Chickens', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate Receptors', 'Ion Channel Gating/*drug effects/physiology', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Kinetics', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/metabolism', 'Patch-Clamp Techniques', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear/*metabolism']",2001/10/02 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/10/02 10:00'],"['2001/10/02 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/02 10:00 [entrez]']","['PHY_12486 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1469-7793.2001.t01-1-00003.x [doi]']",ppublish,J Physiol. 2001 Oct 1;536(Pt 1):3-19. doi: 10.1111/j.1469-7793.2001.t01-1-00003.x.,,,,,PMC2278849,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Later on this diagnosis was questioned and it was suggested that the structures were artifacts that might have been aspirated. Nevertheless, after the immediately given antihelminthic treatment no peripheral blood eosinophilia occurred anymore, but at that point of time pulmonary function was already severely hampered and eventually led to a lethal complication. With the worldwide increasing migration from Third World countries with a high prevalence of parasitic infections, more patients will receive immunosuppressive therapies in countries less familiar with parasites.

Laboratory studies that focus on elucidating mechanisms of action are demonstrating the effectiveness of 'differentiation therapy,' which is now beginning to show translational promise in the clinical setting.","['Leszczyniecka, M', 'Roberts, T', 'Dent, P', 'Grant, S', 'Fisher, P B']","['Leszczyniecka M', 'Roberts T', 'Dent P', 'Grant S', 'Fisher PB']","['Department of Urology, Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University, College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY 10032, USA.']",['eng'],"['CA 83705/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA35675/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA63753/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA72955/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA74468/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK52825/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'NS31492/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",England,Pharmacol Ther,Pharmacology & therapeutics,7905840,"['9008-11-1 (Interferons)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Cell Line', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Gene Expression', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/therapy', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells', 'Humans', 'Interferons/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia/pathology', 'Melanoma/pathology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/pharmacology', 'Neoplasms/genetics/pathology/*therapy', 'Neural Crest/pathology', 'Signal Transduction']",2001/10/02 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/10/02 10:00'],"['2001/10/02 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/02 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0163-7258(01)00132-2 [pii]', '10.1016/s0163-7258(01)00132-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Pharmacol Ther. 2001 May-Jun;90(2-3):105-56. doi: 10.1016/s0163-7258(01)00132-2.,,779,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bone marrow harvested for autologous bone marrow transplantation may contain residual malignant cells even when the cancer is judged to be in remission. Attempts to purge marrow of its putative residual malignant cells may delay hemopoietic reconstitution and are of uncertain efficacy. In this report, we demonstrate the possibility of applying hypothermia to autologous stem cell purging. Using clonogenic assay, we compared the surviving fraction of human leukemia (HL60, K562) and human small cell lung cancer (H69) cell lines with that of normal human bone marrow CFU-GM and BFU-E cells after incubation at 4 +/- 0.1 degrees C for 24 and 48 h. Hypothermia decreased the surviving fraction of HL60, H69, and K562 cells. In contrast, the surviving fractions of stem cells were not affected by the temperature shift. The surviving fraction of HL60 cells at 4 degrees C cooling was significantly lower than that at 22 degrees C cooling. These findings suggest that in vitro hypothermia may selectively purge residual malignant cells in stored remission bone marrow and may be applicable before autologous bone marrow transplantation. In addition, the method is very simple and cost effective.","['Miyagi, K', 'Yamazaki, T', 'Tsujino, I', 'Takahashi, N', 'Koya, Y', 'Masutani, M', 'Sawada, U', 'Horie, T']","['Miyagi K', 'Yamazaki T', 'Tsujino I', 'Takahashi N', 'Koya Y', 'Masutani M', 'Sawada U', 'Horie T']","['The First Department of Internal Medicine, Nihon University School of Medicine, Tokyo, 173-8610, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Cryobiology,Cryobiology,0006252,,IM,"['Bone Marrow Purging/*methods', '*Cold Temperature', 'HL-60 Cells', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'K562 Cells', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",2001/10/02 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/10/02 10:00'],"['2001/10/02 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/10/02 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1006/cryo.2001.2322 [doi]', 'S0011-2240(01)92322-3 [pii]']",ppublish,Cryobiology. 2001 May;42(3):190-5. doi: 10.1006/cryo.2001.2322.,['Copyright 2001 Academic Press.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, the scintigraphy showed increased accumulation in the right lung consistent with infection. We considered possible reasons for these findings. The patient had no history of chemotherapy or blood transfusion, and his iron metabolism was almost normal. He was not receiving any medication which might reduce hepatic blood flow. Blood chemistry suggested normal hepatic and renal function. The patient died from pneumonia 6 weeks later. The autopsy revealed extensive infiltration of the right lung with Bacillus cereus (B. cereus). Metabolic acidosis and/or iron utilization of B. cereus may induce both increased Ga-67 accumulation in the infected lesion and suppressed uptake in the liver, but these mechanisms could not explain normal physiological uptake in the other organs.

Over the past decade, we have begun to appreciate the subtler aspects of the proper use of G-CSF and GM-CSF, identifying appropriate indications and contraindications. In the course of evaluating the multitude of studies, a set of formal recommendations have been propagated for the judicious use of these expensive growth factors. To prevent serious infection, the use of G- or GM-CSF is recommended in a subset of pediatric cancer patients shortly after receiving chemotherapy or a marrow transplant. Children with intensive chemotherapy (e.g., children with high risk ALL, NHL or metastatic neuroblastoma) seem to benefit from hematopoietic growth factors whereas it is not clear that this applies to children undergoing therapy for solid tumors such as rhabdomyosarcoma or Ewing's sarcoma. An exciting development is the use of G-CSF and GM-CSF to mobilize peripheral-blood progenitor cells. Future studies in pediatric cancer patients are clearly warranted to address several issues. Prospective clinical trials are still needed to define specific treatment groups who can benefit from growth factor support. In this regard, efforts must be directed at better defining the endpoints and in particular, assigning value to reduction in treatment of possible infectious complications, such as days in hospital, antibiotic usage and costs. In addition, randomized studies are required to evaluate the proper dosage and duration of therapy, which most likely will vary between groups, depending upon underlying malignancy and therapy given. In addition, combinations of different growth factors have to be tested, particularly if ex vivo expansion and the storage of hematopoietic stem cells are to be utilized in a wider spectrum of patients.","['Lehrnbecher, T']",['Lehrnbecher T'],"['Padiatrische Hamatologie und Onkologie, Universitat Frankfurt, Germany. thomas_lehrnbecher@yahoo.com']",['ger'],,"['Comparative Study', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Germany,Klin Padiatr,Klinische Padiatrie,0326144,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/therapeutic use', 'Growth Substances/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/complications/drug therapy', 'Neoplasms/*complications/drug therapy/surgery', 'Neutropenia/*complications', 'Prospective Studies', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Risk Factors', 'Time Factors']",2001/09/29 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/09/29 10:00'],"['2001/09/29 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/09/29 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1055/s-2001-17505 [doi]'],ppublish,Klin Padiatr. 2001 Sep;213 Suppl 1:A88-102. doi: 10.1055/s-2001-17505.,,110,,Hamatopoetische Wachstumsfaktoren in der Infektionspravention bei Kindern mit hamatologisch-onkologischen Erkrankungen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These results demonstrate that TCR gene transfer can be used to circumvent self-tolerance of autologous T lymphocytes to universal tumor antigens and thus provide the basis for a TCR gene transfer-based broad-spectrum immunotherapy of malignant disease.","['Stanislawski, T', 'Voss, R H', 'Lotz, C', 'Sadovnikova, E', 'Willemsen, R A', 'Kuball, J', 'Ruppert, T', 'Bolhuis, R L', 'Melief, C J', 'Huber, C', 'Stauss, H J', 'Theobald, M']","['Stanislawski T', 'Voss RH', 'Lotz C', 'Sadovnikova E', 'Willemsen RA', 'Kuball J', 'Ruppert T', 'Bolhuis RL', 'Melief CJ', 'Huber C', 'Stauss HJ', 'Theobald M']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Johannes Gutenberg University, D-55101 Mainz, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Nat Immunol,Nature immunology,100941354,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (HLA-A2 Antigen)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (MDM2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Mdm2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic', 'Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte/immunology', '*Genes, T-Cell Receptor', '*Genetic Therapy', 'HLA-A2 Antigen/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Leukemia/immunology/therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Neoplasms/*immunology/therapy', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*immunology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2', '*Self Tolerance', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/09/29 10:00,2001/11/03 10:01,['2001/09/29 10:00'],"['2001/09/29 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/11/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/09/29 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/ni1001-962 [doi]', 'ni1001-962 [pii]']",ppublish,Nat Immunol. 2001 Oct;2(10):962-70. doi: 10.1038/ni1001-962.,,,,,,['Nat Immunol. 2001 Oct;2(10):900-1.
