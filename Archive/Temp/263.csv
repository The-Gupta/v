We have examined immunosuppression induced by an avian osteopetrosis virus, myeloblastosis-associated virus of subgroup B inducing osteopetrosis [MAV-2(O)], and our results suggest that this virus induces immunosuppression by a novel mechanism. Lymphoid cells from osteopetrotic chickens did not respond to a wide dose range of concanavalin A (Con A) over a wide cell density range. Failure to undergo blastogenesis was not due to a lack of Con A-binding sites, since 125I-labeled Con A bound to lymphocytes from infected and uninfected chickens. Infected lymphocytes failed to respond to sodium metaperiodate stimulation, indicating that failure of blastogenesis was not due to a blockage of Con A receptor sites. MAV-2(O) infection of chicks 8 days of age resulted in a transient immunosuppression which appeared 1 to 2 weeks after infection. Cell-mixing experiments showed that MAV-2(O)-induced immunosuppression was not attributable to suppressor cells. In contrast, adherent cells from normal lymphoid preparations restored mitogenicity to lymphocytes from MAV-2(O)-infected animals. Adherent cells were present in the spleen and peripheral blood lymphocytes of MAV-2(O)-infected chickens in numbers comparable to those of the uninfected animal, and both sets of cells contained Fc-dependent phagocytic activity and nonspecific esterase. Peritoneal exudate cells were elicited from osteopetrotic and normal chickens in similar numbers. We conclude that MAV-2(O) induces immunosuppression by interfering with an accessory function of macrophage-like adherent cells.",,,,,

A 4-hr exposure to 100 microM FUra, FUrd, or FdUrd produced greater than 3-fold increments in the intracellular accumulation of [3H]deoxycytidine, and 2-fold increments in the intracellular accumulation of [3H]ara-C were produced over a 1-hr exposure. Intracellular 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine 5'-triphosphate levels in cells exposed to these 3 agents were also increased over 2-fold. L1210 cells exposed sequentially to 1 microM FUra, FUrd, or FdUrd followed by 5 microM ara-C for 1 hr resulted in synergistic cell killing measured by soft-agar cloning. Although intracellular 2'-deoxycytidine 5'-triphosphate levels were reduced in cells treated for 4 hr with FUra and FUrd, this was not associated directly with the maximum accumulation of ara-C. FdUrd treatment was as effective as FUra and FUrd at enhancing ara-C accumulation and 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine 5'-triphosphate formation and producing synergistic cytotoxicity; however, the 2'-deoxycytidine 5'-triphosphate pools were minimally affected. 5'-Deoxy-5-fluorouridine did not increase intracellular ara-C accumulation, reduce intracellular 2'-deoxycytidine 5'-triphosphate levels, or enhance ara-C cytotoxicity. This sequential drug interaction is similar to that which we have observed when methotrexate precedes ara-C and provides a rational basis from which further in vivo studies can be designed.",,,,,

There was a suggestion that chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) associated with the presence of nonspecific suppressor cells also predisposed to late VZ infection, while age less than 10 yr was protective against such infections. Chronic GVHD predisposed to late non-VZ infections, but this was not increased by the presence of nonspecific suppressor cells. HLA nonidentify between patient and marrow donor further increased the risk of late non-VZ infections over and above that due to the presence of chronic GVHD. Receipt of a syngeneic transplant appeared protective for late non-VZ infections.

This is accompanied by a marked reduction in natural killer cell activity against YAC-1 lymphoma [NK(YAC-1)]. To test for the presence of cellular suppressors of NK(YAC-1) in 89Sr-treated mice, in vitro and in vivo cell mixture protocols were used. In vitro, we did not observe any specific inhibitory effect of spleen cells from 89Sr-treated mice on NK(YAC-1) activity of normal spleen cells. The NK(YAC-1) activity of 89Sr-treated mice, measured in vivo by their ability to clear radiolabeled YAC-1 cells from the lungs, was impaired. However, spleen cells from 89Sr-treated mice, when adoptively transferred with normal spleen cells, failed to inhibit the NK(YAC-1) activity of the latter in the lung clearance assay. Further, when normal spleen cells were injected into 89Sr-treated mice, the ability of the transferred cells to mediate in vivo activity was not suppressed in the 89Sr-treated host. These experiments support the suggestion that the low NK(YAC-1) activity in 89Sr-treated mice is not mediated by suppressor cells, but may be due to the destruction of the marrow microenvironment which is essential for the generation of functional NK(YAC-1) cells.",,,,,

The inhibition correlated significantly with antitumour effect, as measured in a life extension assay with L1210 leukaemia. Activity in both biological systems demanded the presence of strongly charged groups and a rigid co-planar aromatic skeleton, these requirements being almost identical to those needed to displace ethidium efficiently from DNA in a simple assay system.

Three phases were identified: an early period of primary B cell dysfunction with concomitant immunoregulatory T cell abnormalities--i.e., decreased helper and increased suppressor activities; an intermediate phase in which B cell dysfunction could be attributed in large measure to immunoregulatory T cell abnormalities; and a late phase of normal B and T lymphocyte functions. Patients with graft-versus-host disease differed from those without it in that they often did not manifest increased T cell suppressor activity in the early period, and they were noted to have prolonged and profound B and T cell abnormalities in the chronic phase of their disease. In selected patients, simultaneous assessment of ratios of Leu-2 to Leu-3 antigens on T cells by monoclonal antibodies and of immunoregulatory T cell functions revealed a correlation between the two only late in the post-transplant period.

Over 88% of his blood lymphocytes were E+, OKT3+, OKT8+ and OKT11+; 54% of the T lymphocytes had receptors for IgG (T gamma cells). Functional studies showed that the T lymphocytes of this patient lacked killer and natural killer cell function but they effectively suppressed the differentiation of normal B cells in a PWM stimulated system. It is suggested that the T-CLL in this patient resulted from the proliferation of the T suppressor subset which was responsible for his hypogammaglobulinaemia.",,,PMC1536424,,

Adduct removal was evaluated in both L1210 and murine bone marrow DNA for lesions induced by three chloroethylnitrosoureas. 1-(2-Chloroethyl)-3-cyclohexyl-1-nitrosourea, a marrow-toxic agent with high carbamoylating activity, was not removed in either system for at least 6 to 12 hr. These results were compared with those obtained with two glucose-linked chloroethylnitrosoureas, chlorozotocin and 1-(2-chloroethyl)-3-(beta-D-glucopyranosyl)-1-nitrosourea. Both of these agents have low marrow toxicity at therapeutic doses. Chlorozotocin, which has very low chemical carbamoylating activity, was found to permit approximately 40% removal of drug-derived DNA adducts in both systems within the first 6 hr and approximately 50% by 18 hr. The second glucose-linked analog, 1-(2-chloroethyl)-3-(beta-D-glucopyranosyl)-1-nitrosourea, has relatively high carbamoylating activity and was found to inhibit early removal of DNA adducts as effectively as does 1-(2-chloroethyl)-3-cyclohexyl-1-nitrosourea. It would thus appear that the selective marrow-sparing property of the sugar-linked chloroethylnitrosoureas is not dependent upon carbamoylation-mediated differences in the rate and extent of DNA adduct removal. In view of the comparable therapeutic activity of the three drugs for L1210 leukemia, therapeutic efficacy does not appear to be impaired by the increased rate of adduct removal observed with chlorozotocin in this system.",,,,,

Active nucleosomes isolated by chromatography on an HMG 14 and 17 glass bead affinity column were analyzed with respect to overall structure, accessory nonhistone components and modifications to the DNA and histones. The experiments lead to the following conclusions: the DNA in the active nucleosome is undermethylated compared to bulk DNA; topoisomerase I is a non-stoichiometric component of the active nucleosome fraction; the level of histone acetylation is enriched in active nucleosomes, but the extent of enrichment cannot account for HMG binding; and the two histone H3 molecules in the active nucleosome can dimerize more readily and are, therefore, probably closer together than those in the bulk of the nucleosomes. Additionally it is shown that HMG 14 and 17 prefer to bind to single- vs. double-stranded nucleic acids.

The cell lines were positive for surface Ia antigen; one stimulated proliferation of the allogeneic mononuclear cells in mixed lymphocyte culture and culture supernatants from the other line contained interleukin 1 (IL-1) when tested for comitogen activity in a standard mouse thymocyte assay. The AMoL cells also contributed accessory factors for mitogen-induced proliferative responses by T cells. High numbers of cells of one of the lines tended to suppress mitogen induced T cell proliferation. Irradiated trinitrophenylated AMoL cells were able to stimulate TNP-specific HLA-DR matched T cell blasts to proliferate. However, when irradiated AMoL cells were cultured with a protein antigen (tetanus toxoid or varicella zoster) plus antigen-specific parental T cell blasts, antigen presentation failed to occur. Diminished phagocytosis by the AMoL cells, together with reduced catabolism of labelled antigen, is a likely explanation for this finding. Our results demonstrate that the concurrent presence of a complex protein antigen and Ia-positive monocytic leukemia cells capable of accessory function is alone insufficient to maintain antigen-specific T cell proliferation. Moreover, these findings suggest that antigen processing, involving ingestion and reexpression of antigenic determinants, is an essential aspect of antigen presentation not tightly linked to Ia antigen expression or IL-1 production in these AMoL lines.",,,,,

Lymphocytes from 16 healthy individuals served as controls. To induce interleukin-2 (IL-2) and gamma-interferon (gamma-IFN) production lymphocytes were stimulated for 24 hrs with ConA or PHA or for 72 hrs with ConA + PMA + urea. alpha-IFN production was induced with Herpes simplex virus I (HSV) and the mycoplasma infected murine leukemia line L1210. Cell-free culture supernatants were harvested and IL-2 activity was determined by means of its growth promoting activity for a murine T-cell line (M-2). IFN activities were measured in a conventional virus plaque reduction assay. Besides lymphokine production the isolated cells were also examined for lymphocyte markers, mitogen responsiveness and NK activity. As compared to the control group, CVID lymphocytes exhibited a slightly enhanced IFN production and a moderately reduced IL-2 production. Three day preincubation in FCS containing medium enhanced the IL-2 production of control and patient lymphocytes. By contrast, preincubation of lymphocytes in medium supplemented with autologous serum no longer enhanced IL-2 production of CVID lymphocytes whereas it still did so for control lymphocytes. A striking finding was the impairment of IL-2 and IFN production in cultures of lymphocytes from patients with a polyclonally activated immune system. Notably lymphocytes from the three patients with angioimmunoblastic lymphadenopathy (AILAP) failed to produce significant amounts of lymphokines. Patients with granulomatous diseases (3 Morbus Behcet, 1 tuberculosis, 2 chronic granulomatous diseases) showed little alterations of their lymphokine production capacity.

The numerous observations from other laboratories that clonotypic antibodies which inhibit antigen-specific reactions are directed against similar disulfide-linked heterodimers provide compelling evidence that this structure is in fact the T cell antigen receptor. Two important conclusions can be drawn from the results of peptide analysis of the receptor subunits. First, the molecular fingerprints of the alpha and beta chains are very different, indicating that the subunits are encoded by different genes. Second, both subunits have constant and variable regions, suggesting that both subunits play a role in producing the antigen combining site. A crucial question that remains to be answered is whether the same or different combining sites are responsible for recognition of antigen and the MHC restricting element. The recent report by Marrack et al. (1983b) that the receptors of two independent T cell hybridomas with the same antigen and MHC specificities expressed the same clonotypic determinant and yielded identical peptide maps (Kappler et al. 1983) provides strong evidence that the heterodimer is responsible for both antigen and MHC recognition. If this is the case, it remains to be determined whether a single site contributed by both subunits recognizes antigen and MHC, or whether one subunit contributes a site for MHC recognition and the other a site for antigen recognition. If, however, as Parham (1984) has recently proposed, conserved rather than polymorphic regions of the MHC product are recognized in MHC restriction, it is possible that the heterodimer functions solely in recognition of antigen, and the restriction may be provided by accessory proteins in a receptor complex. Definitive conclusions as to the role of the individual chains will probably require construction of functional T cells using molecular clones of the genes encoding the receptor and accessory proteins. Recently, the molecular cloning of cDNA encoding putative T cell receptors has been reported from murine (Hedrick et al. 1984) and human (Yanagi et al. 1984) cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",,,,,

Following drug removal, cell growth in suspension culture was measured for up to 7 days, and cell survival was estimated by a colony-formation assay. When cell clonogenicity was plotted against DAC concentration in log-log axis, curves for each exposure time were linear between 0.01 and 0.5 micrograms/ml of DAC, but survival leveled off to a constant percentage for drug concentrations greater than 0.5 micrograms/ml. Percent survival decreased as exposure time increased up to 24 hrs; however, increases in exposure time greater than 24 hrs did not consistently decrease survival any further. At the lower concentrations this leveling of cytotoxicity is due to the spontaneous decomposition of DAC and to the lack of cytotoxicity of the breakdown products. At the higher concentrations the cause of the leveling remains uncertain. Incubation of L1210 with DAC at concentrations greater than 0.5 micrograms/ml for greater than or equal to 24 hrs resulted in total inhibition of measurable cell growth for 72-96 hrs following drug removal. Sequential colony-formation assays at various intervals following drug removal demonstrated a time-dependent increase in cell clonogenicity at a rate approximating the growth rate of untreated L1210 cells.

Cytochemical features helpful in distinguishing acute megakaryoblastic leukaemia, notably the periodic acid-Schiff reaction, differential esterase reactivities and 5'-nucleotidase, are discussed and illustrated. Brief reference is made to the cytochemical differentiation of lymphoblastic leukaemias. Details of a technical method for the demonstration of 5'-nucleotidase are given.",,,,,

Similar effects are produced by a DNA methylation inhibitor, 5-azacytidine, but not by various other toxic agents tested. A defect in DNA methylation, either by depletion of S-adenosyl-L-methionine (the methyl donor) or by inactivation of the relevant enzyme, may be responsible. The T-lymphoblastoid line CCL-119 and the histiocytic lymphoma line U-937 also show these effects, but most fibroblast, epithelial, and lymphoblastoid lines do not. These changes can be largely prevented in each of the three susceptible lines by prior treatment with the tumor promoter, phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), an agent known to cause differentiation in at least two of the lines.

As topoisomerases would be expected to be most active during DNA replication, DNA synthesis inhibitors may alter the sensitivity of cellular DNA to intercalator-induced scission. We report that treatment of L1210 cells with 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine (ara-C) (0.1 microM) or hydroxyurea (HU) (0.1 mM) for 18 hr resulted in a 2- to 2.4-fold enhancement of m-AMSA-induced protein-associated DNA single-strand breaks and DNA-protein cross-links as measured by alkaline elution. This enhancement was dependent on the duration of ara-C or HU treatment as well as on the concentration of ara-C or HU. Enhancement did not correlate with any alteration in cellular uptake of intercalator or with ara-C- or HU-induced alterations in the DNA synthetic rate. The DNA within nuclei isolated from ara-C- or HU-treated cells also displayed an enhanced susceptibility to m-AMSA-induced scission. There was a correlation between enhanced single-strand break formation and recruitment of cells into S-phase as well as between single-strand break formation and the production of a hypomethylated state of cellular DNA. Concurrent with the enhancement of m-AMSA-induced cellular DNA effects was a synergistic effect on m-AMSA cytotoxicity by ara-C or HU. This enhancement of intercalator effects was also found for the intercalator Adriamycin. We propose that these sublethal concentrations of ara-C and HU alter chromatin structure possibly via DNA hypomethylation and/or altered DNA-histone interactions so that intercalator-induced DNA effects are enhanced. Alternatively, the topoisomerase-like activity involved in intercalator-induced, protein-associated DNA break production may be increased in the nuclei of ara-C- or HU-treated cells.",,,,,

Because of treatment advances that have occurred over the last 10 to 20 years, the majority of patients with adult hematologic malignancies that were once considered universally fatal can be either cured or have substantial palliation. Treatment for adult acute leukemia has advanced such that 15% to 20% of patients have prolonged disease and treatment-free survivorship; in Hodgkin's disease, over 70% of patients can be cured; and for the lymphomas, the majority or 50% to 60% of patients can be cured with available treatments. Major treatment advances in supportive treatment such as allogeneic transfusion and allogeneic and autologous bone marrow transplantation improve the perspective for control of the hematologic malignancies. In addition, the potential for biologic response modifiers or the biologic products of normal cells that are normally involved in the regulation of both proliferation and differentiation show enormous potential for the treatment of advanced disease. Studies of interferon have shown promising early results in chronic granulocytic leukemia and in hairy cell leukemia. A new class of drugs, the acridine analogs, of which AMSA (4'-[9-acridinylamino]methanesulfon-M-anisidide) is a member, has been introduced and has established activity against acute leukemia. VP-16 (etoposide) has just become commercially available and is an important drug both in leukemia and lymphoma. Finally, the discovery of new knowledge about the biochemical pharmacology of drugs such as arabinosyl cytosine has offered a major advance in salvage treatment and the potential for substantial further improvement in the frontline management of these diseases. The rapid advances in both palliative and curative treatment for the hematologic malignancies have generally found broad application to the management of advanced cancer arising from other organ systems.",,65,,,

To study the possible involvement of these genes in human leukemia, we have analyzed their expression in a variety of fresh samples.

Exogenous interleukin-2 (IL-2) is generally considered to be the most important medium supplement for the growth of human T cells or cloned T cells. We have studied the role of particular feeder cells or stimulator cells, or both, on the expansion of a panel of cytotoxic and noncytotoxic human T cell clones. By using a combination of peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-transformed B cell lines (B-LCL) as feeder cells in the presence of lectins, we were able to achieve continuous and rapid expansion of phenotypically different allospecific cytotoxic and noncytotoxic T cell clones even without (further) addition of exogenous IL-2. This culture system allows expansion of cloned cells for up to 60 generations within two months with full retention of cytolytic activity and the original target cell specificity, and without the obligatory addition of the original stimulator cell. It was found that, in principle, all combinations of EBV-transformed B cell lines (or even leukemia-derived B cell lines) and PBL feeder cells could serve the purpose, although some B cell lines gave better results than others. No evidence for HLA restriction between responder and feeder or between feeder cells was found, because cells could also be expanded with autologous feeder cells alone. The system appeared to be suitable for the expansion of various types of cytotoxic and non cytotoxic T cells, including cloned directed against major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I or MHC class II antigens as well as MHC-nonrestricted activated killer (AK) clones.",,,,,

Pre- and post-treatment serum samples were evaluated sequentially for interferon activity and for complement-dependent cytotoxic antibody. Our results indicate that serum interferon increased dramatically (less than 3 to 324 units/ml) during treatment only in cats that responded to staphylococcal protein A therapy. Increase of interferon preceded or was closely associated with increasing levels of cytotoxic antibody, loss of viremia, and correction of cytological and hematological abnormalities of three leukemic cats. The cytotoxic antibody was shown to be specific for envelope glycoprotein gp70 of the feline leukemia virus. One persistently feline leukemia virus-infected cat without leukemia that became nonviremic also developed high levels of interferon and specific cytotoxic antibody. By contrast, interferon levels of cats not responding to treatment had levels of less than 3 to 27 units/ml. Normal healthy cats injected with staphylococcal protein A showed moderate transient increases of interferon but no detectable cytotoxic antibodies to FL-74 cells.

Mutant DNA, introduced into rat cells by cotransfection with a herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase gene (HSV tk), directed production of virus particles with reverse transcriptase activity. Infection of cells with these particles led to synthesis of full-length linear and circular forms of unintegrated viral DNA; however, integrated viral DNA was decreased at least by a factor of 10 when examined by DNA hybridization, and the mutant particles were less efficient then wild-type virus at establishing an infection by a factor of at least 300. Pseudotypes formed with the proteins of MuLV-SF1 and the genome of a replication defective marker MuLV, carrying the HSV tk gene, were less effective by at least a factor of 100 in producing tk+ colonies than pseudotypes formed with proteins encoded by wild-type virus.

This fraudulent RNA inhibited tRNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferase early after drug administration. The absence of tRNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferase activity resulted in the synthesis of tRNA specifically deficient in 5-methylcytosine. Here, we show that treatment of L1210 cells, grown intraperitoneally in mice, with 5-azacytidine led to a rapid and prolonged inactivation of DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferase activity and to the synthesis of undermethylated DNA. DNA isolated from the treated tissue was found to inactivate the DNA methylase (decreased Vmax) in in vitro DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferase assays. Kinetic analysis showed noncompetitive inhibition of the substrate by the inhibitor. The persistence of DNA undermethylation after treatment with 5-azadeoxycytidine or 5-azacytidine in animals has not been measured directly; therefore, we have investigated this phenomenon in the intact animal. Prolonged treatment with 5-azacytidine was required to maintain a a fraction of undermethylated sites in DNA of L1210 cells in vivo for up to 4 months or longer after drug withdrawal. Such treatment led to instability of DNA methylation levels in L1210 cells in vivo. At least a partial restoration of DNA 5-methylcytosine levels was observed after acute and chronic 5-azacytidine treatment, respectively. 5-Azacytidine was also found to induce DNA hypomethylation in regenerating, but not in normal adult mouse liver cells.

The reinduction protocol consisted of daunomycin combined with either Ara-C (Regimen 1) or Cyclo-C (Regimen 2). One-hundred thirty eligible patients were entered on the randomized study. Hematologic toxicity was significant in both regimens and resulted in four drug-related deaths. Cardiac toxicity was observed in five patients, manifested only by abnormal echocardiogram or electrocardiogram patterns in three and congestive heart failure in two patients. Seventy-seven of 112 evaluable patients achieved M-1 or M-2A marrow remissions (69%): 46 of 60 on Regimen 1 (75%), 30 of 52 on Regimen 2 (60%). The remission rate between the two regimens was not significantly different. There was no significant difference in the duration of remission comparing maintenance cyclophosphamide combined with Ara-C or with Cyclo-C. Addition of VP-16 and CCNU to the maintenance therapy did not prolong the duration of remission. This study indicates that patients with childhood ANLL previously treated with Ara-C and daunomycin can obtain a successful second remission. A single daily subcutaneous dose of Cyclo-C was found to be as efficacious as Ara-C given intravenously every 12 hr. The single dose schedule provides a convenient way to treat patients with relapsed ANLL in the outpatient setting.",,,,,

The optimal concentration of this compound for its induction capacity was approximately 2 X 10(-5) M. The induced differentiation related markers were morphological change in M1 cells, Fc receptors for IgG (Fc gamma), and non-specific esterase activity. However, phagocytic activity was poorly induced. This suggests that most of Geranyl Farnesol treated cells may be retained functionally incomplete macrophages. The presence of cycloheximide at 1 X 10(-7)M or the incubation of M1 cells at 4 degrees C completely blocked the induction of Fc gamma, suggesting the induction of Fc gamma required protein synthesis. The treatment of M1 cells with Geranyl Farnesol resulted in suppression of DNA and RNA synthesis. Further analysis of RNA metabolism suggested that the suppression of RNA synthesis was mainly due to the decrease of rRNA.

However, cells cultured with 10(-5) M dimaprit showed more than an 80% decrease in their cAMP response to subsequent addition of H2 agonists, whereas the cAMP response to prostaglandin E2 was unaltered. Desensitization was time-dependent (halftime approximately 2.5 hr with 10(-5) M dimaprit), dose-dependent (dimaprit EC50 = 1.4 X 10(-6) M) and completely prevented by 10(-3) M cimetidine. Desensitization of HL-60 cells for 4 hr with 10(-5) M dimaprit followed by the addition of 10(-3) M cimetidine resulted in total recovery of the cAMP response in less than 24 hr. The pharmacologically inactive analog N-methyldimaprit (SK&F 92054) did not increase cAMP production or cause desensitization to H2 stimulation. Desensitization was observed in the presence or absence of a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, indicating that induction of cAMP-phosphodiesterase was not involved in this process. No difference in the number of [3H]tiotidine binding sites was observed between control and dimaprit-desensitized HL-60 cells.

An ATPase activity was tightly associated with p30-II that could not be separated by ion-exchange chromatography, isoelectrofocusing, or glycerol velocity gradient sedimentation. The ATPase hydrolyzed the gamma phosphate from only ATP or dATP. Immunoglobulin directed against R-MuLV p30 completely inhibited the p30-II associated ATPase. Glycerol velocity gradient analysis showed that p30-I sedimented as a 30-kDa species while the p30-II and its associated ATPase sedimented as a 60-kDa species. The p30-II was converted entirely to a 30-kDa form by treatment with 0.2% (w/v) lithium dodecyl sulfate, suggesting that it represented a complexed species of p30. Finally, p30-II was found to stimulate the activity of R-MuLV reverse transcriptase, but p30-I had no effect on the activity of the enzyme.

Further investigation into the cross-reactivity of these antibodies to a variety of neural crest derived cell lines indicated that, with the exception of OKT9, differential binding patterns to different lines were obtained. This suggests that haemopoietic cell subsets and neural crest derived tissues can share similar differentiation antigens. For monoclonals OKT9 and BA2 this observation was confirmed biochemically, showing that it is not just antigenic determinants but similar molecular weight cell surface antigens that are shared between subsets of the two major cell types. A similar analysis using monoclonal antibodies raised against human neuronal cells or cell lines again indicates that some antigens appear unique to neural tissue while others are shared by haemopoietic cell subsets.",,,,,

Out of these 680 belong to acute nonlymphocytic leukemias, FAB M1-M6. Data have been subjected to a multiparameter analysis in term of previous therapy and subtype characteristics of acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL). There are indications that secondary ANLL are characterized by the preponderance of early acute myeloblastic leukemias if compared to de novo ones. Furthermore it has been shown that alkylating agents induced decidedly more acute myelomonocytic leukemias whereas irradiation tended to induce more acute myeloblastic leukemia. Since secondary acute leukemias represent a serious late consequence of alkylating agent and irradiation therapy it is high time to find new therapeutical modalities for lymphomas and to consider the withdrawal of alkylating agents from the therapy of autoimmune disorders.",,,,,

Neither TLM S10b nor BLM was effective against IP P388 and L1210 leukemias, whereas both drugs were active against IP P388/J leukemia (a BLM-sensitive subline). TLM S10b and BLM were both active against murine solid tumors, including SC B16 melanoma, IV Lewis lung carcinoma, SC Madison 109 lung carcinoma, SC CD8F1 mammary carcinoma and SC Colon 38 carcinoma. In human tumor xenograft models, TLM S10b was active against a colon tumor and had slight activity against breast and lung tumors. Compared with TLM S10b, BLM had less activity against the colon tumor, comparable activity against the breast tumor, and no effect against the lung tumor. A consensus of the antitumor data indicated that compared with BLM, TLM S10b had comparable or greater activity and was about twice as potent. TLM S10b and BLM had approximately equivalent LD50 values in mice. TLM S10b had minimal effects on WBC counts, blood urea nitrogen levels, and serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase levels in mice during the time periods monitored. These effects were comparable to or less pronounced than those of BLM. Both drugs caused dose-related increases in the whole-lung hydroxyproline content in mice, but the dose-response curves were not parallel. TLM S10b caused a larger increase than BLM at the lower doses and a smaller increase than BLM at the highest doses. In rats, TLM S10b and BLM caused comparable, significant decreases in lung mechanics; however, histopathological examination of the lungs indicated that TLM S10b caused less evidence of pulmonary toxicity than did BLM at comparable dose levels. TLM S10b was, therefore, generally comparable to BLM in causing pulmonary toxicity in mice and showed possibly less pulmonary toxicity in rats, while demonstrating approximately equivalent to four-fold greater potency, depending on the test system. It also appeared that TLM S10b caused less pulmonary toxicity than BLM in both mice and rats at doses approaching maximally tolerated levels. TLM S10b is currently undergoing phase I clinical evaluation.",,,,,

It was observed that alpha-D-anomer, when kept at 23 degrees for 72 hr, inhibited the uptake of radioactive 2'-deoxycytidine by L1210 cells in vitro as well as the phosphorylation of 2'-deoxycytidine by a cell-free extract from L1210 cells.

BALB/c mice were sensitized with seven injections of live tumor cells, four with NCI-H69 cells and three with NCI-H128 cells. Somatic cell hybridization was performed by fusion of the immune murine splenocytes using syngeneic myeloma cells from the SP2/0 Ag14 cell line. Hybridoma colonies were screened against small cell lung carcinoma cells and normal lung fibroblasts with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Compared to animals immunized with only NCI-H69 or NCI-H128 cells, alternate immunization resulted in the generation of a significantly higher number of hybridomas that reacted selectively with both tumor cell lines. Monoclonal antibodies from two reactive hybrid clones generated by alternate immunization, SCLC 2051 and SCLC 5023, were uniformly negative to normal human tissues including lung, kidney, liver, spleen, breast, thyroid, brain, small intestine, and colon. While both monoclonal antibodies were nonreactive to paraffin-embedded, formalin-fixed, nonmalignant lung biopsies, the monoclonal antibody SCLC 5023 reacted with tumor cell infiltrates in biopsies from small cell lung carcinoma patients (14 of 14 cases positive), using the immunoperoxidase technique. This monoclonal reagent also reacted with other lung tumor cell types, including atypical carcinoid (5 of 5 positive), epidermoid (4 of 6 positive), undifferentiated and bronchoalveolar (3 of 4 cases each positive) carcinomas. By contrast, monoclonal antibody SCLC 2051 apparently identified an antigen expressed preferentially on small cell lung carcinoma cells (12 of 14 positive) and only rarely reacted with other lung tumor cell types (2 of 34 positive). Both monoclonal antibodies were negative to colon carcinoma, epidermoid carcinoma of the floor of the mouth, breast adenocarcinoma, and B- and T-cell leukemia and lymphoma cells, as determined by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, indirect immunofluorescence, and immunoperoxidase techniques. These observations suggest that SCLC 2051 and SCLC 5023 may be of value in identifying tumor-associated antigens expressed in small cell and other lung carcinomas. In addition, the generation of antibody-producing cells towards common tumor-associated antigens may be enhanced by immunization with multiple tumor cell lines of the same histological type.",,,,,

We describe a procedure that allows simultaneous analysis of karyotype and cell cytology in mitotic cells. The method differs from conventional cytogenetic analysis in that after mild hypotonic treatment, the cells are cytocentrifuged onto glass slides. In mitotic cells, this procedure often results in adequate spread of the chromosomes within the intact cell membrane. The cytoplasmic structure also remains intact, so that cytologic preparations are of good quality. Morphologic and immunologic identification of mitotic cells can be done using routine hematologic stains, such as Giemsa or Sudan black B, and various antisera using immunofluorescence techniques.

The tumors investigated included 11 Hodgkin lymphomas and various types of Non-Hodgkin lymphomas (altogether 25). Whereas the small lymphoid cells found in Hodgkin lymphomas show a diploid DNA content with a wide scattering, in the large mononuclear reticular cells (Hodgkin cells) as well as in Sternberg's giant cells only aneuploid DNA values are seen lying in the hyperdiploid, hypertetraploid and hyperoctoploid regions. DNA stemlines are found in the aneuploid regions, but in some cases they are missing. This indicates that we are dealing with malignant tumor cells. In Non-Hodgkin lymphomas with a low grade of malignancy (centrocytic-centroblastic lymphoma, centrocytic lymphoma, CLL) an aneuploid DNA content is found particularly in the large cells (centroblasts, lymphoblasts) with or without a DNA stemline. These cells must be considered as primary malignant tumor cells. In the immunoblastic lymphoma of high malignancy only aneuploid tumor cells are present showing a particularly intense DNA content in the large immunoblasts, whereas a DNA stemline is usually missing. The range of aneuploid values, the number of polyploid tumor cells and the presence or absence of a DNA stemline are important criterions in determining the degree of malignancy. By means of cytophotometric measurements of the DNA content in the tumor cells of malignant lymphomas it is possible to assertain the degree of malignancy and to establish an objective prognosis.",,,,,

The dose of MCMV required to cause 50% mortality or morbidity in control C57BL/6 mice dropped 4- and greater than 11-fold, respectively, in mice first treated with anti-asialo GM1. NK cell-depleted mice had higher (up to 1,000-fold) virus titers in their lungs, spleens, and livers at days 3, 5, 7, and 9 postinfection. Spleens and livers of control mice were virus-free by day 7 postinfection, and their lungs showed no signs of active infection at any time. In contrast, MCMV had disseminated to the lungs of NK cell-depleted mice by day 5, and these mice still had moderate levels of virus in their lungs, spleens, and livers at day 9. Markedly severe pathological changes were noted in the livers and spleens of NK cell-depleted, MCMV-infected mice. These included ballooning degeneration of hepatocytes and spleen necrosis. MCMV-infected, NK cell-depleted mice had severe spleen leukopenia, and their spleen leukocytes exhibited a significantly lower (up to 13-fold) response to the T cell mitogen concanavalin A when compared with those of uninfected and MCMV-infected controls. It appeared that NK cells exerted their most potent antiviral effect early in the infection, in a pattern correlating with interferon production and NK cell activation; treatment with anti-asialo GM1 later in infection had no effect on virus titers. The relative effect of NK cell depletion on MCMV pathogenesis depended on the injection route of the virus. NK cell depletion greatly augmented MCMV synthesis and pathogenesis in mice inoculated either intravenously or intraperitoneally but had no effect on the course of disease after intranasal inoculation, at any time point examined. One month after intraperitoneal inoculation of virus, NK cell depletion resulted in a six- to eightfold increase in salivary gland virus titers in persistently infected mice, suggesting that NK cells may be important in controlling virus synthesis in the salivary gland during persistent infection. This treatment did not, however, induce dissemination of virus to other organs. These data support the hypothesis that NK cells limit the severity, extent, and duration of acute MCMV infection and that they may also be involved in regulating the persistent infection.",,,PMC254497,,

Chickens infected as 10-day-old embryos with subgroup F viruses develop fibrosarcomas, nephroblastomas, osteopetrosis, B-cell lymphomas, and a high incidence of a proliferative disorder involving the lung. Fibrosarcomas, nephroblastomas, and lymphomas appear after long latent periods (3 to 12 months). They contain discrete virus-cell junction fragments and are therefore clonal outgrowths of a single infected cell. Two ring-necked pheasant virus-induced B-cell lymphomas and an adenocarcinoma of the abdomen contained proviruses integrated at the c-myc locus and elevated levels of myc mRNA. At least four of the fibrosarcomas appeared to contain proviruses integrated at a common site, suggesting that a specific cellular gene may be involved in these tumors. The host gene has not been identified, however; 16 different oncogene probes failed to hybridize to fibrosarcoma junction fragments. In contrast to these neoplasms, lung lesions appeared rapidly (4 to 5 weeks), showed no evidence of clonality, and lacked long terminal repeat-initiated transcripts other than viral 35S and 21S mRNA.

The data presented here suggest that, during human myeloid differentiation, important, possibly transcriptional, regulatory mechanisms of gene expression are active long after the first commitment event of the hemopoietic undifferentiated stem cell.",,,,,

The suppressor T cell factor (TsF) exhibits fine antigenic specificity since it suppresses the DTH response induced by HEL without affecting the DTH response induced by ring-necked pheasant egg-white lysozyme (REL), a lysozyme closely related to HEL. Conversely, LH8-105 TsF is able to suppress the DTH response induced by human lysozyme, distantly related to HEL but sharing a common epitope critical for induction of suppressive activity. The fine antigenic specificity of LH8-105 TsF for a restricted epitope on the HEL molecule is confirmed by binding to HEL but not to REL immunosorbents. This TsF also bears I-J determinants, as demonstrated by binding to monoclonal anti-I-J immunosorbents, and it suppresses the afferent but not the efferent phase of the DTH response to HEL. The afferent suppression is controlled by genes apparently mapping in the I-J subregion of the H-2 complex since I-J-incompatible mice are not suppressed by LH8-105 TsF injection. This inducer-type TsF induces second-order effector suppressor T cells only in HEL-primed mice indicating the primary role of antigen, in association with H-2 (I-J) products, in the afferent portion of this suppressive circuit.",,,,,

Three different clusters of epitopes on the Fc epsilon portion could be detected by antibody competition studies. These antigenic determinants were expressed on the Fc epsilon portion and required the two heavy chains in their native conformation. Two groups of mAb and their Fab' fragments completely inhibited the binding of 125I-labeled IgE to rat basophilic leukemia cells (RBL), and one mAb inhibited the specific IgE binding only partially (55-65%). Likewise, the Fab' fragments of the purified mAb inhibited the antigen-mediated, IgE-dependent, serotonin release of RBL cells. These in vitro findings were confirmed by in vivo experiments, which demonstrated that the anti-IgE mAb could specifically block passive cutaneous anaphylaxis reaction when injected i.d., before challenging with the antigen.

The VTM from murine thymocytes and T-cell lines had Mr of 65,000-68,000. The VTM from distinct cell lines differ by isoelectric focusing and resolution of tryptic peptides indicating clonal restriction. VTM lack conventional light- or heavy-chain-constant region determinants but cross-react with antisera directed against defined VHa allotypes and JH peptides. The detection of a cross-reaction with a synthetic JH peptide is consistent with recently published data identifying JH-related sequences in putative T-cell receptor genes. The amino acid compositions of the VTM were distinct from those of mammalian Ig, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens, and viral glycoproteins, but significant similarities occur with Ig V regions or heavy chains of primitive vertebrates.

In contrast to leukemic cells of B-cell lineage (as in B-cell acute or chronic lymphocytic leukemia and non-T-cell, non-B-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia), T-cell-leukemia cells responded within five minutes to hypotonic swelling with an increase in potassium permeability and restoration toward isotonic volume.

Fab fragments of human immunoglobulin (Ig) derived from an HSV-1 seropositive individual blocked NK activity against HSV-1-infected cells, whereas Fab fragments from a seronegative individual had no effect. Fab fragments of monoclonal antibodies specific for different epitopes of the HSV-1 glycoproteins gB and gC blocked NK activity, suggesting that NK cells interact directly with viral glycoproteins. In contrast, a control (HSV-unreactive) monoclonal antibody did not block NK activity. Further evidence that the blocking activity was associated with HSV glycoproteins was obtained by showing that: a) gC-specific antibodies did not decrease NK activity against cells infected with an HSV-1 mutant which does not insert gC into infected cell surface membranes; b) gB-specific antibodies did not reduce NK cytotoxicity against target cells infected with HSV-1 in the presence of 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2dG), which prevents cell surface expression of gB; c) HSV-1 glycoprotein-specific antibodies did not alter NK activity against uninfected cells or against K562, an NK-susceptible tumor cell line; and d) a monoclonal antibody reactive with a cell membrane glycolipid markedly reduced NK reactivity against K562 but had little effect on NK reactivity against HSV-1-infected cells, suggesting that NK cells recognize different determinants on the two types of target cells. Analysis of the fine specificity of NK cell recognition of HSV-1 glycoproteins was performed by using target cells infected with antigenic variants of HSV-1 referred to as monoclonal antibody-resistant (mar) mutants. mar mutants are altered in distinct epitopes of gB or gC, resulting in loss of recognition by the selecting virus-neutralizing monoclonal antibody. NK activity was reduced against cells infected with some, but not all, of these variants. Together, these findings demonstrated a positive correlation between expression of HSV-1 glycoproteins gB and gC and susceptibility of HSV-1-infected target cells to NK activity, implicating the viral glycoproteins as cell surface components recognized by NK cells. Moreover, mutations affecting glycoprotein epitopes defined by monoclonal antibodies also influenced the interaction between NK effector cells and HSV-1-infected target cells, suggesting that viral antigenic sites recognized by NK cells overlap with those recognized by anti-HSV-1 antibodies.",,,,,

Injection of infected mice with an interferon (IFN) inducer or in vitro treatment of infected splenocytes with IFN, a phorbol ester, or indomethacin failed to restore their NK activity to the degree shown by age-matched, uninfected mice. Fractionation of infected splenocytes by nylon wool, Sephadex G-10, or carbonyl iron and magnetism treatments was also unable to effect an increase in NK activity. Addition of infected splenocytes to uninfected ones in in vitro NK assays suppressed the NK activity of the latter, and the suppression could be partially or wholly abrogated by prior fractionation of infected splenocytes by the methods noted above. In vitro treatment of infected splenocytes with concanavalin A revealed the presence of NK activity in these cell populations. The results indicate that splenocytes in L. donovani-infected mice become insensitive to IFN stimulation; and the impairment of another, possibly IFN-independent pathway of NK-cell activation may also contribute to the observed L. donovani-induced depression in splenic NK activity in C57BL/6 mice.",,,,,

The positive (fluorescent) fraction sorted from McAb-treated bone marrow buffy coat cells showed a marked enrichment of myeloid precursors, while nonmyeloid cells were recovered in the negative fraction.

Comparisons with other anti-myelomonocytic McAbs reported so far suggest that GM 58/8 has more restricted reactivity and shows more efficient CFU-GM cytotoxicity. Patterns of reactivity with normal cells and established lines indicate that the antigenic determinant identified by GM 58/8 is different from that recognized by previously described anti-myelomonocytic McAbs. McAb GM 58/8 could be used to isolate or remove pure populations of progenitors and/or more differentiated cells of the myelomonocytic lineage for in vitro studies.

Ruthenium red increased m-AMSA accumulation by both P388 and P388/ADR cells; the extent of this effect was a function of the concentration of both agents. Uptake enhancement occurred within 5 min of exposure of cells to ruthenium red and was readily reversed when cells were suspended in fresh medium. A 24-hr exposure to ruthenium red was needed to affect vinblastine or daunorubicin accumulation, and the effect was substantially less than that observed with m-AMSA.

The hybrids were treated with S1 endonuclease and analyzed by alkaline gel electrophoresis. This analysis revealed two groups of RNA molecules encoded in two regions of the LPV genome. One group includes four colinear transcripts of 2.3, 2.1, 1.85, and 1.2 kb, whose polyadenylated termini map at a single site on the LPV DNA. The second group includes two less-abundant transcripts of 1.8 and 1.95 kb.

K562 cells express all globin genes with the exception of that for beta-globin; failure to produce beta-globin could result from an acquired mutation in each of the beta-globin genes or from an alteration in the regulatory factor environment of the beta-globin gene. To uncover a possible acquired mutation, restriction endonuclease analysis of genomic K562 DNA and expression studies of a cloned K562 beta-globin gene were carried out. Restriction endonuclease analysis revealed no structural alteration of the K562 beta-globin genes. Analysis of the polymorphic Ava II site in intervening sequence 2 of the beta-globin gene showed that K562 cells contain two different beta-globin alleles, both of which are inactive. A K562 beta-globin gene was cloned, ligated into the expression vector pLTN3B, and introduced into COS cells. Transcripts were analyzed by RNA blot, dot blot, S1 nuclease mapping, and primer extension assay. The cloned K562 beta-globin gene was transcribed in COS cells as efficiently as a normal beta-globin gene introduced into COS cells; the mRNA was 10 S and polyadenylylated; the 5' and 3' termini and the processing of transcripts were identical to that of mRNA transcribed from a normal gene. Based on these data we suggest that the absence of beta-globin gene expression results not from an alteration in the beta-globin gene, but from a quantitative or qualitative alteration in a trans-acting factor important in beta-globin gene expression.",,,PMC345615,,

There is much evidence that complement is activated directly by retroviruses in the absence of antibody. Thus, human complement is thought to function as a natural defence mechanism against horizontal infection by retroviruses. Recently, a novel retrovirus, human T-cell leukaemia virus (HTLV), has been shown to be associated with adult T-cell leukaemia/lymphoma (ATL). A large number of healthy adults in south-west Japan, the West Indies and Africa carry antibodies against HTLV and these seropositive individuals are considered to be carriers of HTLV. Thus, horizontal spread of HTLV occurs frequently among humans. We set out to determine whether HTLV reacts with human complement, and report here that, unlike other animal retroviruses, HTLV is not lysed by normal human serum--this might explain the infectivity and persistence of HTLV in humans.",,,,,

Such ideas originate primarily from the ability of v-onc genes and 'activated' c-onc genes to induce uncontrolled cellular proliferation, and their capacity to arrest or interfere with differentiation processes in some systems. Haematopoietic cell populations provide additional support for these ideas as c-myb RNA is present in cell lines corresponding to immature, but not mature, cell types, and elevated levels have been found in tissues that are active in haematopoiesis. We have now examined the effects of induced differentiation on c-onc gene expression in a murine myeloid leukaemia cell line, WEHI-3B ('D+' subline). Our results show that the expression of c-myb and c-myc, at the level of transcription, decreases only at late stages in the monocytic differentiation of WEHI-3B cells, while expression of c-fos increases markedly. We suggest that c-myb and c-myc do not themselves control myeloid differentiation, but that they function in the maintenance of the proliferative state of myeloid cells. The induction of c-fos may reflect its role in some macrophage-specific functions.",,,,,

Virol. 31:741-751, 1979), has been characterized by recombinant DNA technology. The entire mutant genome was cloned from an EcoRI digest of integrated cellular DNA into bacteriophage lambda Charon 4A and then subcloned at the EcoRI site of pBR322. NIH-3T3 cells transfected with the plasmid clone, termed pRTM (RTM, reverse transcriptase mutant), reproduced the properties of clone 23 virus-infected cells. In vivo ligation experiments involving cotransfection of subclones of pRTM and wild-type murine leukemia virus localized the defect in the clone 23 genome to an approximately 400-base-pair region in the pol gene between the SalI and XhoI sites. Sequence analysis of this region in the wild-type and mutant genomes revealed that the mutant has one additional C residue located 231 bases downstream of the last base of the SalI recognition site. This 1-base insertion brings three TGA termination codons into phase. Thus, the mutation in clone 23 leads to premature termination of translation, explaining the presence in clone 23 virions of a truncated polymerase with low levels of enzymatic activity. It was previously shown that the gag precursor is cleaved normally in clone 23-infected cells; therefore, if a virus-coded protease is involved in this cleavage, it must be encoded by sequences upstream of the reverse transcriptase region of the pol gene. This consideration, coupled with the observed molecular weight of the mutant polymerase and our precise determination of its C terminus, have led to a proposal for the genetic organization of the murine leukemia virus pol gene.",,,PMC254461,['GENBANK/K02027'],

The bulk of the pulse-labeled RNA had a sedimentation coefficient greater than 45 S. After heating in 50% (v/v) formamide, it sedimented between the 18 S and 28 S regions of the sucrose gradient. Proof of the existence of interstrand duplexes prior to deproteinization was obtained by the introduction of interstrand cross-links using 4'-aminomethyl-4,5',8-trimethylpsoralen and u.v. irradiation. Thermal denaturation did not reduce the sedimentation coefficient of pulse-labeled RNA obtained from nuclei treated with this reagent and u.v. irradiated. Interstrand duplexes were observed among the non-polyadenylated RNA species as well as between polyadenylated and non-polyadenylated RNAs. beta-Globin mRNA but not beta-globin pre-mRNA also contained interstrand duplex regions. In this study, we were able to identify two distinct classes of polyadenylated nuclear RNA, which were differentiated with respect to whether or not they were associated with other RNA molecules. The first class was composed of poly(A)+ molecules that were free of interactions with other RNAs. beta-Globin pre-mRNA belongs to this class. The second class included poly(A)+ molecules that contained interstrand duplexes. beta-Globin mRNA is involved in this kind of interaction. In addition, hybrids between small nuclear RNAs and heterogeneous nuclear RNA were isolated. These hybrids were formed with all the U-rich species, 4.5 S, 4.5 SI and a novel species designated W. Approximately equal numbers of hybrids were formed by species U1a, U1b, U2, U6 and W; however, species U4 and U5 were significantly under-represented. Most of these hybrids were found to be associated stably with non-polyadenylated RNA. These observations demonstrated for the first time that small nuclear RNA-heterogeneous nuclear RNA hybrids can be isolated without crosslinking, and that proteins are not necessary to stabilize the complexes. However, not all molecules of a given small nuclear RNA species are involved in the formation of these hybrids. The distribution of a given small nuclear RNA species between the free and bound state does not reflect the stability of the complex in vitro but rather the abundance of complementary sequences in the heterogeneous nuclear RNA.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",,,,,

This finding suggested that endocytosis, like mediator release, is triggered by cross-linking of the cell surface receptors for IgE. In the present study, we analyzed the temporal and functional relationships between the two events. We used rat basophilic leukemia cells (RBL-HR+-2H3) and rat peritoneal mast cells, which were allowed to bind monomeric 125I mouse IgE hybridoma anti-dinitrophenyl (HI-DNP-E-26-82), and the polyvalent antigen 131I-dinitrophenylated human serum albumin (DNP15-HSA). We found that at 37 degrees C, 50% of the cell surface-bound immune complexes were internalized rapidly (t1/2 3 to 5 min) by RBL-HR+-2H3 cells with only minimal reduction (1/3) in the extent of internalization when very few of the receptors (approximately 5%) were saturated with IgE. Normal mast cells internalized cell surface-bound immune complexes at a similar rate (t1/2 4 to 5 min). Unlike serotonin release, internalization was independent of extracellular calcium and continued to increase as the ratio of DNP15-HSA to IgE increased 10- to 100-fold over the ratio required for optimal histamine release. In the RBL cells, internalization preceded serotonin release, reaching a peak at about 10 min, while the release (t1/2 13 to 19 min) continued for up to 60 min. Presumably, some of the cross-linked IgE internalized less effectively and continued to trigger serotonin release. The reverse relationship between the rates of internalization and release (t1/2 less than 1 min) was found in normal rat mast cells. We conclude that although cross-linking of two or more receptors triggered both endocytosis and exocytosis, the two events are not necessarily sequential.",,,,,

A correlation between blocking of lytic activity by cold TC and the percentage of conjugate formation with the particular cold TC was observed. Because these clones also show differential susceptibility to inhibition of lysis by various MCA, it is concluded that human cytotoxic T cell clones can exert multiple lytic activities, i.e., the operationally defined lytic mechanisms differ at least at certain stages of the lytic cycle.",,,,,

In normal hemopoiesis and acute leukemia stem cell renewal is not exact; proliferative capacity is lost gradually. As a consequence, clonal populations cannot be continued indefinitely. Postdeterministic differentiation normally leads to cellular diversity; following transformation this diversity is increased, with the production of blast cells together with one or more myelopoietic lineage. The blasts are heterogeneous both in their proliferative capacity and their phenotypes, as determined using immunologically defined markers. Both self-renewal and determination are considered to be irreversible in vivo. By contrast, in continuous myelopoietic cell lines self-renewal is sufficiently precise to confer immortality on the populations. Furthermore, both determination and renewal may in some instances be reversible.

Treatment strategies for hairy cell leukemia have evolved and are being modified as more is learned about the disease. Splenectomy is the initial treatment when patients become symptomatic, and if the disease progresses after splenectomy, chlorambucil offers good control in many patients. Radiation can be used for local palliation, as when complications such as bulky adenopathy or bone lesions occur. Initial studies using interferon in the treatment of hairy cell leukemia look encouraging, but more investigation is necessary before the role of interferon in treatment of hairy cell leukemia is determined.",,,,,

The mutants could be divided into two classes depending on the phenotype and map position of the deletion within the pol gene. Mutants with deletions mapping in the 5' portion of the gene were found to be completely deficient in reverse transcriptase activity. Mutants mapping in the 3' portion of the gene, however, assembled and released virions with normal levels of reverse transcriptase and RNAase H activities. When applied to permissive cells, these virions directed the synthesis of all three forms of unintegrated viral DNA: full-length, double-stranded linear DNA and the two circular forms with one and two copies of the long terminal repeat sequences. The infection was arrested at this point and the infected cells did not become producers of virus. Thus the 3' portion of the pol gene encodes a polypeptide with a function distinct from that of reverse transcriptase, which is not required for synthesis of viral DNA but is essential for establishment of that DNA in a stable, active form in the infected cell. We suggest that this function may be the integration of the proviral DNA.",,,,,

C., Zahn, R. K., and Muller, W. E. G. Eur. J. Biochem., 129: 43-49, 1982). RNA efflux from isolated mouse lymphoma (L5178Y) cell nuclei is strongly reduced if 9-beta-D-arabinofuranosyladenine 5'-triphosphate (ara-ATP) is present in the transport medium. Half-maximal inhibition of RNA efflux occurs with 120 microM ara-ATP. Most likely, the inhibitory effect of ara-ATP is caused by inhibition of nuclear envelope nucleoside triphosphatase; this enzyme was found to be highly sensitive to inhibition by this antibiotic. The inhibition type of the nucleoside triphosphatase of rat liver nuclear ghosts is competitive with respect to ATP; the Ki:Km ratio was determined to be 0.27. Besides nucleoside triphosphatase, nuclear envelopes contain a protein phosphokinase modulating the affinity of pore complex laminae to poly(A). This enzyme was also found to be strongly inhibited by ara-ATP in a competitive way with respect to ATP (Ki:Km, 0.056) and could therefore also contribute to the overall inhibition of RNA transport. The polyadenylation of endogenous RNA by poly(A) polymerase(s) in intact rat liver nuclei as well as in nuclear matrices isolated from the same source was found to be markedly suppressed in the presence of ara-ATP. The inhibitions of both poly(A) polymerase activities (contained in whole nuclei or nuclear matrix bound) are of the competitive type with respect to ATP. In in vitro assays, nuclear envelope nucleoside triphosphatase is inhibited by microtubule protein. Of the 2 ATP-dependent enzyme activities associated with microtubule protein (cyclic adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate-dependent protein kinase and adenosine triphosphatase), only the kinase was slightly affected by ara-ATP. Cellular uptake of adenosine 5'-monophosphate and perhaps 9-beta-D-arabinofuranosyladenine 5'-monophosphate (ara-AMP) is facilitated by a cellular membrane-bound 5'-nucleotidase. Our studies revealed that neither cleavage of ara-AMP nor inhibition of the enzyme activity by ara-AMP occurs. 9-beta-D-Arabinofuranosyladenine and ara-AMP represent neither direct mutagens nor premutagens as determined by the Salmonella-mammalian microsome mutagenicity test.",,,,,

After a 2-hr exposure to MTX, the concentrations necessary to produce 50% inhibition of colony formation were 100, 25, 1.2, and 0.25 microM, respectively. This was inversely related to the ability of the tumor cells to accumulate MTX polyglutamyl derivatives and consistent with the observation that no polyglutamyl derivatives were observed in granulocytic progenitor cells after a 2-hr exposure to 5 micron MTX. Continuous exposure to glycine (200 microM)-adenosine (100 microM)-thymidine (10 microM) (GAT), along with MTX, protected cells from MTX cytotoxicity by circumventing the requirement for tetrahydrofolate cofactors. However, while the presence of GAT during a 2-hr exposure to 5 microM MTX is sufficient to protect granulocyte progenitor cells from MTX cytotoxicity, the presence of GAT, even after MTX is removed, is required to protect tumor cells. Indeed, if, after a 2-hr exposure of tumor cells to MTX and GAT, both MTX and GAT are removed before plating in agar, cytotoxicity to tumor cells was expressed. This sustained antitumor effect of MTX correlates with the rapid build-up of polyglutamyl derivatives that are retained in the cell even after extracellular and intracellular monoglutamate is eliminated. This is in contrast to granulocytic progenitor cells which appear to be susceptible to the drug only during the period of exposure to the monoglutamate under these conditions. The data strongly suggest that the marked differences in the accumulation of MTX polyglutamyl derivatives between the tumor cells studied and the murine bone marrow granulocytic progenitor cells are an important element in MTX selectivity.",,,,,

We found that the precipitation patterns of free and IgE-bound receptor were identical but differed from that of unbound IgE. Thus, 85 to 95% of the free receptor and the IgE-receptor complexes precipitated at 13% PEG in the presence of 0.5% Nonidet P-40, whereas 95% of the unbound IgE remained soluble. A similar degree of differentiation between the precipitation of receptor-bound and unbound IgE was found when we used extracts and PEG solutions prepared with several non-ionic and/or neutral detergents. The intact IgE-receptor complex with the full complement of subunits (alpha, beta, gamma) precipitated more efficiently than the IgE-alpha-chain-complex. The presence of phospholipids, which were previously shown to be important for preservation of the association between the receptor subunits, enhanced the efficiency of precipitation of the IgE-receptor complex. The presence of PEG also had an effect on the solubility of cellular phospholipids and some of the detergents, although the effect of PEG on either could not be directly related to its effect on the solubility of the IgE-receptor complex. The radioiodinated receptor for IgE, much like other radioiodinated RBL cell membrane proteins, was soluble (greater than or equal to 95%) at approximately 7% PEG but could be specifically and efficiently precipitated from crude cell extracts, in the presence of 7% PEG upon the addition of anti-receptor immunoglobulins alone. Using mouse anti-dinitrophenyl IgE antibody, we found that unlike unbound antigen (DNP-BGG) or the IgE-receptor complex, the detergent-solubilized DNP-BGG-IgE-receptor complex was insoluble at 7% PEG.

This antibody also reacts with an originally noncytotoxic, non-LGL lymphocyte population that contains precursors of the inducible NK-like and allospecific cytotoxicity in the blood. The NK-like effectors are also NK-9+. The results thus suggest a close precursor relationship of endogenous NK cells, NK-like cells, and allospecific CTL in the blood. NK-9 antibody does not crossreact with B cells, monocytes, or granulocytes or with any of a large panel of cultured cell lines tested, including T and B cell as well as null cell lymphoma-leukemia lines. It does not inhibit the functional properties of the positive cells. The antigens for NK-9 antibody on the cell surface have m.w. of 190, 200, and 220 kD, and at least the former two appear to be glycosylated. The non-LGL, noncytotoxic NK-9+ cells contain only the 190 kD antigen, but the other two appear concomitantly with the induced NK-like cytotoxic activity on the cells.

After cessation of L-asparaginase administration, the ratio increased to 1.6 times that of the pretreatment value. These data indicate that the plasminogen-binding form of alpha 2-antiplasmin is the form primarily synthesized in vivo. L-Asparaginase therapy reduced plasma levels of plasminogen and histidine-rich glycoprotein ( HRG ) and influenced the equilibrium between HRG , plasminogen and HRG -plasminogen complex, with a more pronounced decrease of plasminogen (62% +/- 8) and HRG (76% +/- 11) in comparison to the free-plasminogen levels (51% +/- 6). alpha 2-Macroglobulin was only slightly influenced by L-asparaginase and may consequently play a more pronounced role in inhibition. This is suggested by moderate declines in functional tests of plasmin, urokinase and tissue activator inhibition by patients plasma, and by the ratio of inhibition of these enzymes over alpha 2-antiplasmin. Thus the bleeding tendency described during L-asparaginase therapy can be ascribed not only to a temporary deficiency of coagulation factors but also to temporary alpha 2-antiplasmin deficiency.",,,,,

Essentially all cells showed plasmacytoid differentiation, although the degree varied. Rare cells (less than 1%) appeared to be terminally differentiated into plasma cells. The increase in secreted IgM was preceded by a small increase in mu-chain RNA, with an increase in the ratio of secreted to membrane form. A small increase in c-myc RNA was also detected with differentiation. This might reflect coordinate regulation of the transcription of immunoglobulin and the translocated c-myc gene. Thus, the maturational arrest of this lymphoma cell line can be overcome with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, indicating that translocation of the c-myc gene does not permanently block the capacity for differentiation. Further, this gene continues to be expressed to at least the same level during cell maturation.

Dexamethasone suppresses HMBA-mediated MELC differentiation, but MELC retain a memory for their exposure to HMBA since, on transfer from culture with HMBA and dexamethasone to medium without additions, a portion of the cells express characteristics of terminal differentiation. This study characterizes the steroid suppressed steps in the multi-step process of inducer-mediated MELC terminal differentiation. MELC in culture with HMBA and dexamethasone show low levels of commitment to terminal cell division; upon transfer to culture with inducer alone there is a rapid increase in the proportion of committed cells. The magnitude of this rapid or ""step-up"" expression of commitment increased with the length of prior culture with inducer and steroid. This step-up expression is not inhibited by actinomycin D or cordycepin but is blocked by cycloheximide. HMBA is required for step-up expression of commitment. In the absence of inducer, there is a rapid decay in the capacity for step-up expression. Thus, HMBA initiates a series of changes leading to the accumulation of factors--which may be mRNAs--whose expression is blocked by dexamethasone. Hemin, which induces MELC accumulation of globin mRNA but not commitment to terminal cell division, cannot, as does HMBA or dimethyl sulfoxide, cause step-up expression of commitment.",,,PMC345514,,

These two reactivities differ in disease distribution as well as antigen specificity. Although sera from both of these autoimmune syndromes contain snRNP reactive antibodies, distinction in antigen binding specificity have been difficult to define because of the particulate nature of the snRNP antigen. To overcome this problem, while retaining the antigen in a native state, cells were pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine for 8 min to generate radioactive snRNP proteins in forms reflecting incomplete de novo particle assembly. Immunoprecipitation of snRNP antigen prepared in this manner revealed clearly distinct patterns of Sm and RNP immunorecognition . While Sm sera precipitated all eight labeled snRNP proteins, RNP antibodies precipitated only two of the eight. However, a brief pulse followed by periods of cold chase demonstrated that RNP sera can eventually coprecipitate all components of the complete particle. In addition to antibodies to the other six snRNP peptides, all Sm sera tested have been found to contain the RNP-like reactivity with snRNP proteins A and C. RNP reactivity with these two components is of particular interest because these proteins are unique in the metabolism of snRNPs.

If the RNase H is responsible for creating the correct primer terminus, then it must possess a specific endonucleolytic activity capable of recognizing the sequence in the RNA where plus strands are initiated. The 16-base RNase A-resistant fragment which spans the plus-strand origin can also serve as a source of the specific plus-strand primer RNA. Evidence is presented that some of the plus-strand origin fragments synthesized in the endogenous reaction contain 5' ribonucleotides, suggesting that specific RNA primers for plus-strand initiation may be generated during reverse transcription in vivo as well.",,,PMC254394,,

Increased erythropoietic activity induced by treatment of adult mice with phenylhydrazine ( PHZ ) resulted in a seven- to eightfold increase in the frequency of spleen and bone marrow cells expressing this gp70.

On the basis of the bm13 virus-specific recognition pattern of a series of Kb-mutant virus-infected (V+) cells, these Kb mutants could be divided into two groups that either shared the relevant H-2K restriction specificities with H-2Kb ( bm3 , bm5 , bm6 , and bm11 ) or lacked them completely (bm1) and/or almost completely ( bm8 ). In the study presented in this report, we concentrated on the alloreactive CTL included in the repertoire of bm13 Moloney-specific CTL. These CTL lysed noninfected (V-) allogeneic target cells of many H-2 types, including all Kb-mutant cells tested (bm1, bm3 , bm5 , bm6 , bm8 , and bm11 ). Recognition of V- cells of two Kb mutants, bm3 and bm11 , which share a common amino acid substitution at position 77 of the H-2K molecule with an additional change at position 89 in bm3 , was compared with recognition of the other Kb-mutant V- target cells in cold target inhibition studies. These studies showed that bm3 and bm11 cells share a determinant or determinants on the H-2K molecule recognized by alloreactive CTL among the Moloney virus-specific CTL population not present on the other Kb-mutant cells; lysis of both target cells was inhibited only by bm3 and bm11 V- cells. On the other hand, lysis of bm3 V+ target cells by bm13 virus-specific CTL was inhibited by all Kb-mutant V+ cells ( bm3 , bm5 , bm6 , and bm11 ) that were killed virus specifically by bm13 CTL. Thus, common determinants on the H-2K molecule of these Kb-mutant V+ cells are recognized by Kb-restricted Moloney virus-specific CTL. From the difference in inhibition pattern of the lytic reaction against bm3 V+ vs bm3 V- cells, we conclude that determinants on the same H-2K molecule recognized by Moloney virus-specific CTL and allocross -reactive effector cells included in the Moloney virus-specific population are not identical.",,,,,

B6.C-H- 2bm13 ( bm13 ) mice, however, carrying a mutation at the Db locus, show an increased H-2Kb-restricted CTL response without a demonstrable CTL component restricted by the mutant Dbm13 molecule (D----K shift). These purely Kb-restricted bm13 virus-specific CTL were incubated with a series of Kb mutant virus-infected target cells to study the effect of the mutations at the target cell level. Of six Kb-mutant virus-infected target cells tested, bm1 cells were not recognized and bm8 cells were recognized only marginally by bm13 virus-specific CTL, whereas bm3 , bm5 , bm6 , and bm11 cells were fully recognized. Thus, the bm3 , bm5 , bm6 , and bm11 Kb mutants fully share the relevant H-2K restriction specificities with H-2Kb, whereas the bm1 mutant totally and the bm8 mutant almost completely lack these specificities. This result differs markedly from the restriction site relationships among B6 and these Kb mutants in other antigenic systems. The most striking example concerns the bm11 mutant, which is fully recognized by Moloney-specific CTL, but not at all by Sendai, minor H (H-3.1, H-4.2), and sulfhydryl hapten-specific CTL. Monoclonal anti-H-2Kb antibody B8-3-24 inhibited virus-specific lysis by bm13 CTL of all Kb virus-infected mutant target cells to which this antibody binds. Lysis of bm5 and bm11 but not of bm3 target cells was inhibited, in line with the fact that B8-3-24 antibody does not bind bm3 . On the other hand, not only bm5 and bm11 but also bm3 virus-infected target cells blocked virus-specific lysis to the same extent as syngeneic bm13 target cells. Therefore, bm13 virus-specific CTL populations do not recognize the discrete cluster alteration in the Kbm3 molecule, as identified by antibody B8-3-24. The bm1 and the bm8 mutations, which have structural alterations in completely different sites of the Kb molecule, show complete or almost complete loss, respectively, of Kb-Moloney restriction sites. This finding supports the notion that these virus-specific CTL recognize conformational determinants rather than linear amino acid sequences.",,,,,

Culture in medium supplemented with TPA concentrations of l ng/ml or more invariably caused a decrease in the susceptibility of the sensitive clone E10/P2, whereas treatment of the relatively resistant clone F9/P2 with TPA under identical conditions caused a significant increase in susceptibility to natural cytotoxicity. In both cases the change in susceptibility occurred within 1 day of culture in TPA and was rapidly reversible following removal of the inducing agent. The changes in resistance to natural cytotoxicity induced by TPA were independent of variations in osmotic fragility and were not attributable to alterations in NK cell binding capacity as determined by cold competition analysis. In contrast to the effect of TPA, exposure of E10/P2 and F9/P2 to interferon (IFN) caused a reduction in sensitivity to natural cytotoxicity of both populations which was associated with a decreased capacity to compete for lysis of labelled target cells. These data suggest that the effects of differentiating agents on target susceptibility to NK cell lysis are variable and that responses to TPA are clonally distributed within cell populations.",,,,,

Three types of MMC-D, conjugates with dextran with molecular weights of 10,000, 70,000 and 500,000, were synthesized, and the disposition of MMC was determined by bioassay. Following i.m. injection of MMC-D, MMC was retained at the injection site for a long period in a conjugated form while MMC administered as a free form disappeared rapidly. The disappearance was markedly influenced by the size of carrier dextran, because the remaining amount of MMC increased with an increase of molecular size. The lymphatic uptake of the drug was evaluated by determining the concentration in the regional lymph nodes and thoracic lymph fluid. In contrast to a slight lymphatic uptake following i.v. and i.m. injection of free MMC, MMC-D exhibited remarkable accumulation in the regional lymph nodes after i.m. injection which persisted up to 48 hr. MMC-D (Mr 10,000) appeared in the thoracic lymph as both the conjugated and the free form. Larger MMC-D gave a persistent supply of free MMC in thoracic lymph, suggesting that it was accumulated in the lymph node and supplying MMC continuously. These MMC-Ds suppressed the lymph node metastases introduced by a s.c. inoculation of L1210 leukemia cells. The usefulness of MMC-D as a lymphotropic delivery system for preventing lymphatic metastasis of cancer was suggested.",,,,,

The intracellular pH measured by phosphorus 31 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) was 7.3. The amount of 2,3-DPG was determined by an enzymatic method and by 31P NMR. The level of 2,3-DPG in uninduced K562 cells, containing 0.5 pg of hemoglobin per cell, was low (5 +/- 0.5 mumole/10(8) cells), but increased to 64 +/- 5 mumole/10(8) cells upon induction of hemoglobin accumulation (to a final level of 20 pg hemoglobin/cell). For several experiments, there was a closely coordinated relationship between 2,3-DPG and hemoglobin levels, at about 1:1 stoichiometry of the two molecules. The time course of induction of hemoglobin, and of 2,3-DPG levels, are very similar; both processes are reversible. These data suggest that induction of hemoglobin synthesis in K562 cells by hemin results in hemoglobin-containing cells with normal oxygenation properties and that 2,3-DPG and hemoglobin levels are coordinately controlled in these cells. Elucidation of the mechanism of this effect should be of importance in understanding the erythroid-like differentiation of these cells.",,,,,

In the present study, adherent P388AD.2 cells were pulsed with the tolerogen, fluoresceinated (FL) sheep gamma-globulin (SGG), washed, and incubated with normal spleen cells. After 24 hr, the spleen cells were harvested and challenged in secondary cultures with immunogenic doses of FL-thymic independent (TI) antigens. The plaque-forming cell response on day 3 of secondary culture was increased as much as 400% compared with control spleen cultures exposed to untreated P388AD.2 cells. The increased response was specific for the FL-hapten and occurred only when P388AD.2 cells were pulsed with FL-Ig or FL-F(ab')2 fragments, but not with FL-synthetic tolerogens or other FL-antigens. Furthermore, the augmentation required histocompatible T cells in the primary cultures. Additional experiments showed that if cultures were devoid of Lyt-1+ cells but not Lyt-2+ cells, no augmentation occurred. A variety of other macrophage-like tumor cells, some with known antigen presenting properties, were tested for the ability to present tolerogen in an immunogenic fashion. Only an I-A+ J774 clone was able to present tolerogen in an immunogenic fashion. However, we failed to find a correlation between the presence of surface Ia antigen and tolerogen-presenting ability. The results suggest that certain types of cells may play a role in immune regulation by abrogating the tolerogenicity of Ig tolerogens via their presentation in an immunogenic mode.",,,,,

The platelet alpha-granule proteins (von Willebrand factor, platelet factor-4 and beta-thromboglobulin) were immunologically detected in the HEL cell cytoplasm and their amounts increased after induction. Of particular interest was the presence of platelet membrane proteins. A monoclonal antibody specific for glycoprotein Ib bound to HEL cells. Platelet membrane glycoproteins IIb and IIIa were identified on intact cells using specific antibodies in a binding assay or in cell lysates using either crossed immunoelectrophoresis or an immunoblotting procedure following SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Most HEL cells also expressed the platelet alloantigen PIA1. All of the platelet membrane proteins were present in higher amounts after induction. Glycophorin A, specific for the erythroid lineage, was also detected on HEL cells. Thus, while confirming the presence of erythroid markers, our studies provide evidence that the HEL cell line also expresses platelet antigens.

Lymphocytes incubated overnight in the presence of phorbol esters 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate and phorbol-12,13-dibutyrate [P(Bu)2] had enhanced function. Incubation with 4-alpha-phorbol-12,13-didecanoate was without effect. Enhancing activity was also exerted by the indole alkaloids, teleocidin and lyngbyatoxin A, and the polyacetates, aplysiatoxin and debromoaplysiatoxin, but not by dihydroteleocidin. Only the tumor-promoting compounds activated the cytotoxic potential. The substances acted in a dose-dependent manner with optimal activity at characteristic concentrations. Overnight incubation of lymphocytes at 4 degrees did not change their spontaneous cytotoxicity but abolished the enhancing effect of P(Bu)2. Thus, P(Bu)2-induced activation occurred only on metabolically active cells. The activation did not require DNA synthesis. Similar to controls, the P(Bu)2-treated cells required divalent cations and an intact cytoskeleton in order to perform their lytic function. Experiments with the various metabolic inhibitors indicate that phorbol ester treatment does not induce an alternative cytotoxic mechanism since, as with untreated lymphocytes, P(Bu)2-activated cells require contact with the target and intact secretory functions. The enhanced cytolytic potential was not due to induction of alpha-interferon (IFN-alpha) production, as shown by the fact that the effect was not abolished by addition of anti-IFN antibodies during the P(Bu)2 treatment of lymphocytes or during the cytotoxic assay. However, the presence of antiserum against IFN reduced the cytotoxic potential of control cells, suggesting that endogenous IFN production contributes to the maintenance of lytic function in cultured cells. If this mechanism is counteracted by addition of anti-IFN serum, the phorbol esters can provide an alternative activation signal. When P(Bu)2-activated lymphocytes were subsequently treated with IFN-alpha or IFN-gamma, their lytic capacity was further increased. These results indicate that P(Bu)2 and IFN activate cytotoxic potential through different pathways.",,,,,

Furthermore, antisera to DR antigens only partially blocked leukaemic LAD. The results support the notion that LAD on acute leukaemias are not necessarily associated with or identical to HLA-DR antigens, and that the lymphocyte activating capacity of HLA-DR may be modulated.",,,PMC1976761,,

The substrate activity it displays over a wide range of concentrations (0-200 microM) is nearly equivalent to that of methotrexate. The 7-hydroxy derivative of dichloromethotrexate is also a substrate for FPGS. The pattern of polyglutamate products synthesized by rat liver FPGS was nearly identical with both 7-hydroxymethotrexate and methotrexate. In addition, conversion of MTX polyglutamates to the corresponding 7-hydroxy compounds was demonstrated using partially purified rabbit liver aldehyde oxidase. The rate of conversion was concentration dependent, and the relative rate decreased as the MTX polyglutamate chain length increased. We propose that 7-hydroxymethotrexate polyglutamates may be formed by initial hydroxylation of methotrexate and subsequent polyglutamate formation or by direct hydroxylation of methotrexate polyglutamates. It was further shown that the relative substrate activity of folate analogs for folylpolyglutamate synthetase is dependent on the source of the enzyme.",,,,,

In contrast, the nature of zoster--its unpredictability and low attack rate--makes immunoprophylaxis much more difficult to implement. Varicella may be modified by administration of varicella-zoster immune globulin within three days of a known exposure to the virus. Although interferon has not yet been used in an attempt to prevent or modify varicella in humans, it has been used successfully to abort an outbreak of simian varicella in a monkey colony. Thus it might be clinically useful, particularly for those who cannot be given varicella-zoster immune globulin within three days of exposure. Transfer factor has also been shown to induce at least partial immunity to varicella in children with leukemia. The duration of this protection is unknown, and further study of the efficacy of transfer factor against both varicella and possibly even against zoster seems warranted. Live attenuated varicella vaccine, although still experimental, seems now to be the most practical way to prevent severe varicella in high-risk persons. The vaccine is safe and immunogenic, even in children with underlying leukemia who are still receiving chemotherapy. Studies in Japan, Europe, and the United States have shown that most vaccinated leukemic children who are exposed are protected against severe disease, although mild breakthrough cases have been reported. Varicella vaccine's potential to cause zoster remains under study.",,32,,,

Our results indicate that DNase I introduces specific cuts into the beta-globin gene cluster in erythroid cells but not in leukocytes. The predominant sites are located at the 5' sides of the G gamma-, A gamma-, delta-, and beta-globin genes, within 200 base pairs of the respective cap sites. Examination of fetal liver cells has revealed the presence of hypersensitive sites at the 5' side of all four genes, whereas analysis of adult bone marrow has revealed the characteristic sites near the delta- and beta-globin genes but no hypersensitive sites at the 5' termini of the G gamma- or A gamma-globin genes. The presence of delta and beta hypersensitive sites in fetal cells suggests that the increment in expression of the delta and beta genes during development most likely involves the modulation of another pathway to gene expression. Using isolated nuclei from HEL and K562 cells, we have found that the G gamma, A gamma, delta, and beta genes are preferentially sensitive [relative to the pro-alpha2(I) collagen gene] to mild digestion with DNase I, whereas these genes are as resistant as collagen genes in cells that do not express globin.

An attractive candidate for the erythropoietin precursor is renin substrate (angiotensinogen) which has chemical similarities with erythropoietin. We show here that purified renin substrate from human plasma is immunologically related to human erythropoietin.

In competition binding studies, the antihuman Ia antibodies competed with each other, but not with a number of murine monoclonals raised directly to guinea pig Ia antigens. When the antihuman Ia monoclonals were tested for their ability to inhibit the proliferative response of primed guinea pig T cells to antigen-pulsed macrophages, they completely inhibited the response of strain 2 T cells to the complex antigen ovalbumin while having no effect on the response to the copolymer L-glutamic acid, L-lysine. In contrast, the monoclonals raised against guinea pig Ia had much less dramatic effects on the response of uncloned T cells to these antigens.

When KBALB cells are treated with UV-MCMV and subsequently with potent chemical inducers, such as 5-Iododeoxyuridine (IdUrd) or cycloheximide, the activation frequencies of type C virus are significantly lower than in controls exposed to the chemical inducers alone: 60% for IdUrd and 44% for cycloheximide. This decrease of activation appears to be mediated by endogenous interferon (IFN) induced by UV-MCMV in KBALB cells, as could be proven by neutralization of the inhibitory activity. Indeed, after exposure of UV-MCMV-infected cells to anti-IFN gamma globulin, the level of C type virus increases, reaching values obtained with IdUrd or cycloheximide in the absence of UV-MCMV. The inhibitory activity associated with UV-MCMV is dose-dependent and the xenotropic type C virus appears to be more sensitive than the ecotropic (N-tropic) retrovirus of BALB/c cells.",,,,,

These findings indicate that the O2--producing system and the system provoking membrane potential changes may develop concomitantly as human granulocytes mature and differentiate, and that the development of these systems and of phagocytic activity may be independently regulated.",,,PMC425119,,

This placental inhibitor has been partially purified and characterized. It elutes at 0.1-0.2 M phosphate on hydroxyapatite chromatography and can be further purified by phosphocellulose chromatography where it elutes at 0.4 M KCl. By these purification procedures, specific activities of 40-70,000 units of inhibitor per mg of protein were obtained. The size of the inhibitor is about 60-65,000 daltons as estimated by velocity sedimentation. The inhibitor purified by these techniques selectively inhibits the activity of purified reverse transcriptase from Rauscher murine leukemia virus and baboon endogenous virus. It is substantially less active against the reverse transcriptase of avian myeloblastosis virus. The specificity of this inhibitor for mammalian enzymes and particularly for the human placental reverse transcriptase suggests that it plays a role in the regulation of DNA synthesis in human placental development.",,,,,

The procedure employs (a) honeycomb cloning plates and (b) nonlethal vital stains. Instead of placing cloning rings around colonies, cells are initially seeded at clonal density directly into a plate containing an array of cloning rings (the honeycomb plate). Hence, the time involved in placing cloning rings around colonies is eliminated. Second, clone-containing wells of the honeycomb plate are easily identified by staining plates with the nonlethal vital stains, MTT or INT tetrazolium. Vital staining eliminates the time involved in searching for clones. Last, clones are transferred with a cotton-tipped swab thereby eliminating the time involved in trypsinization of cells. In this fashion, one can pick and transfer clones of substrate adherent mammalian cells at a rate of one clone/10 to 15 s. Thus, mammalian cells can be cloned as rapidly as cloning can be carried out in microbial systems.",,,,,

Treatment of cultured stromal cells with antibody and complement resulted in the loss of most flat angulated cells and many of the fat-containing cells. However, long-term cultures were generated with cytotoxic antibody-treated marrow buffy coat cells, and the stromal cells in these cultures were also CALLA-positive. We conclude that CALLA-bearing stromal cells arise from CALLA-negative progenitors.

In particular it could help to understand whether the haemoglobin switch is under the influence of environmental factors or inherently programmed in the haemopoietic cell population. In the present study we have monitored haemoglobin synthesis following fetal liver transplantation (FLT) in a patient with acute leukaemia after intensive chemoradiotherapy. 28 days following FLT, the haemoglobin synthesis showed a predominantly fetal haemoglobin pattern, as determined by globin chain synthesis of bone marrow cells and by the peroxidase anti-peroxidase (PAP) method applied to bone marrow sections treated with anti-fetal haemoglobin antibodies. These findings demonstrate that, in man, fetal haemopoietic cells, transplanted into an adult environment, do not immediately switch to the production of adult haemoglobin.",,,,,

A similar increment was observed for the formation of 6-thioguanine triphosphate.

In contrast, there was a 50% reduction in the amount of 6-thioguanine incorporated into RNA and DNA following acivicin pretreatment. Cytofluorometric analysis revealed that an 18-hr exposure to 5 X 10(6) M acivicin increased the population 5-phase cells, which are more sensitive to the actions of 6-thioguanine, by 50% relative to untreated controls. In both suspension culture growth and soft agar studies, the sequential administration of acivicin followed by 6-thioguanine resulted in substantial growth inhibitory activity; in contrast, the effects of the reverse sequence were subadditive. Pretreatment of L1210 cells with acivicin potentiates the action of subsequently administered 6-thioguanine, and the mechanism may involve both biochemical as well as cytokinetic factors. In vivo studies involving the sequential administration of these agents appear warranted.",,,,,

Enzyme activities were evaluated by means of a scoring system. Scores of AcP and ANAE were higher in normal T cells than non-T cells. In comparison, the activated T cells in infectious mononucleosis showed increased AcP and decreased ANAE reaction. Malignant T lymphoblasts had a distinct granular AcP positivity in contrast to the faint reactivity observed in cALL blasts, whereas ANAE showed negative or weak reaction in both subsets. High scores and distinct staining patterns for both enzymes were found in T CLL and T prolymphocytic leukaemia, clearly different from the weak activities seen in B CLL, B PLL and some B cell lymphomas. The latter, too, could be distinguished by mutual differences in enzyme reactions. High AcP and ANAE scores were also found in hairy cell leukaemia, and the staining patterns together with the tartrate resistance firmly established the diagnosis.

Previous studies have demonstrated that splenic T-cells are the major responding cell population but have not clarified whether the antigens responsible for the reactions are exclusively viral in origin or may involve nonviral tumor-associated antigens (TAA). Pretreatment of PTCM preparations with polyvalent anti-murine mammary tumor virus (MuMTV) completely obliterated the ability of PTCM to stimulate an innocent bystander cytotoxicity reaction; however, it reduced the blastogenic response by only 60%, suggesting that the two assays may measure different antigenic reactivities. The specificity of the anti-MuMTV blocking for viral antigens was demonstrated by the complete absorption of the serum-blocking reaction with purified MuMTV particles in the cytotoxicity assay; however, absorption was only partial in the blastogenesis assay. Incubation with purified Rauscher murine leukemia virus particles failed to absorb the neutralizing effect of the sera. These data suggest that putative TAA can be detected in the blastogenesis assay but not in the cytotoxicity reaction. Ammonium sulfate-precipitated immunoglobulin fractions of sera from tumor-bearing BALB/cfC3H mice (TBMS) completely blocked the stimulatory potential of PTCM in both the blastogenesis and the cytotoxicity assays. In the reciprocal experiment to that described above, preabsorption of TBMS immunoglobulins with purified MuMTV completely removed the inhibition of the cytotoxicity but again only partially restored the blastogenic response. The reaction could be completely restored by preabsorption of TBMS with PTCM. These results support the contention of nonvirion antigen involvement in the blastogenesis reaction. In conclusion, these two assay systems detect different antigenic determinants on the MuMTV-expressing tumor cell membranes. Both viral and other antigens appear to be relevant in this model system, and serum factors present in the immunoglobulin fractions of tumor-bearing mice can inhibit T-cell responses directed at either kind of antigenic moieties.",,,,,

Mutants with deletions in P30 were completely defective in virion particle production even though an altered gag precursor protein is synthesized. This domain is apparently critical for particle formation. A mutant in P10 was able to release virion particles into the medium, and low levels of reverse transcriptase activity could be detected in these virions. To explore the effects of these mutations on the utilization of the gag-pol precursor, we have introduced these mutants into cells already releasing defective particles from an endogenous provirus which directs the synthesis of gag gene products and not pol gene products. The P10 mutant was capable of providing pol function as judged by the incorporation of high levels of reverse transcriptase into the particles and complete complementation for XC plaque formation. In contrast, the mutants in P30 were negative in this complementation test. Thus, those gag mutants which were unable on their own to assemble virion particles were also unable to contribute the gag-pol precursor to these particles. These mutations are the first to be mapped to the gag region which affect pol function, suggesting that the gag-pol precursor must be assembled before pol is functionally separated from the gag domain. The concordance of the effects of different mutations on both particle formation and gag-pol utilization suggests that similar domains of gag (namely, domains in the P30 region) are needed for these two processes.",,,PMC255554,"['GENBANK/J02255', 'GENBANK/J02256', 'GENBANK/J02257']",

Approximately 50% of the labeled DNA fragments synthesized under these conditions retained the priming RNA on their 5' ends. When the isolated fragments were hybridized back to the template DNA and again treated with the reverse transcriptase, all of the RNA was removed from the labeled DNA. By using 5'-end-labeled pancreatic RNase A-resistant fragments, it was possible to show that the RNA primers were removed intact.

However, addition of IFN did alter the level of cellular viral reverse transcriptase activity. Chromatography of extracts from virus-producing cells on poly(G)-Sepharose columns revealed two peaks of reverse transcriptase activity. Peaks I and II eluted at 0.45 M and 0.65 M NaCl, respectively, while the cellular DNA polymerase beta eluted earlier at 0.3 M NaCl. IFN treatment of these chronic virus producer cells resulted in a 5-fold increase in peak I whereas peak II and polymerase beta remained essentially unchanged. When reverse transcriptase from purified virions was similarly chromatographed on poly(G)-Sepharose, all of the enzymatic activity eluted as peak I. Thus, the reverse transcriptase in peak I from cell extracts appears to be the form which is present in mature virions.

However, the therapy of viral diseases and malignant tumors by IFN alone is limited from the data obtained so far. The combination of IFN therapy with other therapies should be considered. In this article, the fundamental studies on the combined therapy of IFN and other agents will be reviewed. As for the combined therapy of IFN and chemotherapeutic agents, the synergic or additive effect is recognized unless IFN and chemotherapeutic agent exist in the body at the same time. The combined therapy of IFN and radiation is effective when the tumor has been irradiated before the administration of IFN. The efficacy of the combined therapy of IFN and immunomodulators is confirmed in mouse experiment. The development of tumor transplanted into the mice is highly inhibited when IFN-alpha or beta and gamma are combined. At present, there is few reports about the combination therapy in the clinical application of IFN, although the data on the combination therapy are increasing in the animal experiments. The issues about the combination therapy will become important in the near future.",,,,,

Gradually more and better agents have become available to the physician and to the patient suffering from cancer. The physician-scientist has, in turn, learned a great deal about normal and abnormal cellular biology by using these drugs as probes. The observations that certain tissues and certain tumors share patterns of drug toxicity have led to a broadening of biologic understanding and to the use of combinations of drugs with shared antitumor activity and unshared toxicities. This empiric art of cancer chemotherapy has resulted in great progress in the treatment of a large number of advanced cancers. As important, however, is that this experience has resulted in knowledge which is leading to the development of rationally designed therapeutic regimens; to drug analogues seeking greater therapeutic-toxic ratios; to the development of methods for chemically interfering with toxic drug effects while allowing or enhancing antitumor effect; and to work defining effects of drug timing. Drug timing research considers drug dosage in respect to the timing of a drug relative to the timing of other drugs (drug-time-drug interactions) or to other doses of that same drug (drug-drug interval); the order of drugs (drug-drug sequence); and the timing of drugs relative to an internal organismic time structure (time-drug interactions). Data in this brief review clearly show that drug timing needs to be considered when designing rational chemotherapy for a living organism suffering from a cancer. The beautiful spatiotemporal complexity of life is not to be ignored or avoided, but should be considered as a golden opportunity to use what few imprecise chemical weapons we have a little more effectively.",,66,,,

The two gp70s gave characteristic fragmentation patterns; the amino-terminal fragments of FrMCF gp70 were smaller than the corresponding fragments of FLV and contained a trypsin site which resulted in a 19,000-dalton amino-terminal fragment not observed for FLV, whereas both molecules yielded an identically sized carboxy-terminal fragment. All amino-terminal fragments of both gp70 molecules contained an endo H-sensitive oligosaccharide chain; for FrMCF, a second endo H-sensitive carbohydrate was present as well at a carboxy-terminal site for approximately 50% of the molecules. Several aspects of the disulfide interactions of the two gp70s were conserved; in both cases the carboxy-terminal fragments were disulfide bonded to p15(E), there were no disulfide bonds between amino- and carboxy-terminal fragments, and the amino-terminal fragments exhibited a significant increase in mobility upon analysis by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under nonreducing conditions. Analysis of the immunoreactivity of the different domains of the proteins by immunoprecipitation of the fragments with antisera prepared against xenotropic murine leukemia virus and feline leukemia virus gp70s indicated major differences in antigenicity for the amino-terminal domains of FLV and FrMCF gp70, whereas the carboxy-terminal domains were immunologically conserved. Similar analyses with antibodies specific for p15(E) and Pr15(E) demonstrate that these components are conserved as well. These data provide direct evidence that p15(E) and the C-terminal gp70 domain of FrMCF gp70 are related to the corresponding regions of the ecotropic FLV parent and indicate that the acquisition of MCF-specific properties is due to the replacement of the ecotropic amino-terminal gp70 domain with sequences related to those of xenotropic gp70s.",,,PMC255486,,

Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of radiolabelled viral components showed the absence of the glycosylated protein gp70 as well as of the p15E cleavage product of the polyprotein precursor gPr90env. The premature loss of the gp70 molecule from LCV to the culture medium was ruled out since no peak of D-[14C]glucosamine-labelled glycoprotein was detected by affinity chromatography or immunoprecipitation of concentrated medium. The ultrastructural and biochemical results all supported the hypothesis that the absence of infectivity was due to the lack of gp70 glycoprotein in the envelope of LCV.

Mice whose skin was painted with trinitrochlorobenzene (TNCB) exhibited a variety of anti-TNP T cell responses, including delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) and cytotoxic T cell responses, as well as helper T cell activity. Pretreatment of C3H/He mice with TNP-conjugated copolymer of D-glutamic acid and lysine (TNP-D-GL) or cyclophosphamide, which have been shown, respectively, to inactivate TNP-specific suppressor T cells or suppressor T cells in general, exhibited a slight or marginal augmentation of DTH and cytotoxic potentials when tested 5 wk after TNCB painting. In contrast, the same pretreatment regimens induced an appreciably amplified generation of anti-TNP helper T cell activity. This amplified TNP-helper T cell activity was demonstrated to enhance cytotoxic responses to antigens other than TNP in an antigen-nonspecific way. In fact, such helper T cells enhanced antitumor CTL responses when co-cultured with spleen cells from syngeneic X5563 plasmacytoma-bearing mice in the presence of TNBS-modified X5563 tumor cells. This amplified TNP-helper cell system was utilized for its immunotherapeutic potential. When TNCB was injected into X5563 tumor mass of syngeneic C3H/He mice in which the amplified TNP-helper T cell activity had been generated, an appreciable number of growing tumors was observed to regress. This contrasted with the low incidence of tumor regression observed in mice in which TNP-helper activity had been induced by TNCB painting without inactivation of suppressors. Thus, the present model provides an effective immunotherapeutic manipulation for eliciting enhanced in vivo tumor regression, and emphasizes a role of helper T cells in augmentation of syngeneic tumor immunity.",,,,,

Performance was analyzed as a function of age at diagnosis and age at evaluation in a sample of 110 children with ALL (mean age = 13.28 years). Results, although for the most part nonsignificant, do reveal significantly poorer performance on an Aphasia Screening Test rating by those diagnosed early (at or before five years of age) and assessed at or before 13 years of age when contrasted with those diagnosed early and assessed after their thirteenth year. Further analysis revealed a significant decline in spelling scores for those off therapy for more than two years. There was also a consistent trend for decline across most language-related skills measures as time off therapy increased. These results reflect either recovery from mild acute language dysfunction over time superimposed on a general trend for decline in language-related skills as time off therapy increases, or sampling error.

These procedures, although relatively safe, present occasional risks to donors and recipients. Some of the occasional adverse problems experienced by donors include citrate toxicity or acute hypocalcemia, hypotension, hypervolemia, venospasm or vein occlusion, chills, anaphylactoid reactions, hemorrhage, abdominal pain or complications related to equipment failure and related technical problems. Potential risks to donors include those related to the receiving of six percent hydroxyethyl starch (HES), dextrans, or corticosteroids, lymphocyte depletion or immunosuppression, and effects on the complement system. Prophylactic granulocyte transfusions to prevent the occurrence of infections and associated complications in neutropenic patients have not proven to be efficacious; therapeutic granulocyte transfusions appear to be more effective. Indications for therapeutic granulocyte transfusions include those patients with known infections unresponsive to appropriately aggressive antibiotic chemotherapy over a two or three day period combined with findings of a peripheral granulocyte count less than 500 mm3 and especially those with counts below 100 mm3 and/or prolonged fever greater then 38 degrees C (100.4 degrees F) for 24 to 48 hours. In addition, the patient should have a reasonable chance for bone marrow recovery. Hazards or complications associated with granulocyte transfusions include: (a) immediate transfusion reactions, (b) hypersensitivity reactions, (c) pulmonary infiltrates, (d) alloimmunization, (e) transmission of infections, and (f) the possibility of Graft vs. Host (GVH) disease. The current best use of apheresis platelets is to provide therapeutic doses of single donor matched platelets for patients refractory to pooled random donor platelets. Alloimmunization represents the major complication of therapeutic platelet transfusion and is characterized clinically by the failure to achieve expected platelet count increments after transfusion. Future developments which might greatly improve the effectiveness of therapeutic and possibly prophylactic leukapheresis and plateletpheresis include the development of effective sedimenting agents with shorter biological half-lives, more efficient and less expensive methods of procurement of granulocytes and platelets, improved methods of cryopreservation of granulocytes and platelets, better methods for detecting and quantitating antigranulocyte and/or antiplatelet antibodies, and more efficient evaluation of possible synergism of granulocyte transfusions with antibiotic therapy and residual host defense. These improvements may be of great value in the effective utilization of granulocyte and platelet products and in determining which patients are most likely to receive the maximum benefit from granulocyte and platelet support.",,138,,,

This lecture will review recent findings on this polymer obtained in our laboratory. Poly (ADP-Rib) has long been thought to be a linear homopolymer attached to nuclear protein. The ribose-ribose bond of poly(ADP-Rib) was shown to be an alpha(1"" leads to 2') ribosidic bond. There are two molecular forms of poly(ADP-Rib), namely low molecular weight (L) and high molecular weight (H) poly(ADR-Rib) molecules. The L and H fractions of poly(ADP-Rib) are separable by gel filtration, sucrose density gradient centrifugation and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Physicochemically the L and H forms differ in their molecular size, solubility in high salt, rate of hydrolysis by venom phosphodiesterase and circular dichroism (CD) spectrum. However, the two forms have a similar ultraviolet (UV) absorption spectrum, both show a similar hyperchromicity on heating to 98 degrees C or hydrolysis with snake venom phosphodiesterase and give similar results on ordinary chain length determination. The great discrepancy in size observed by physicochemical methods and by the ordinary chain length method indicates the presence of a branching structure in poly(ADP-Rib). The branching structure was proved by demonstrating the presence of a unique compound, 2'[1""-ribosyl-2""(1""'-ribosyl)]adenosine-5',5"",5""'-tris(phosphate) and by electron microscopy. The amount of poly(ADP-Rib) was determined by our new method, consisting of tritium labeling and high performance liquid chromatography. The merit of this method is that it can determine the recovery of poly(ADP-Rib) exactly and that its sensitivity is high. The amount of poly(ADP-Rib) changed dramatically when human promyelocytic leukemia cells were induced to differentiate by dimethyl sulfoxide or 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate. The use of inhibitors of poly (ADP-Rib) polymerase in combination with bleomycin, a DNA damaging antitumor drug, potentiated the antitumor activity of bleomycin against Ehrlich ascites carcinoma cells in vivo.",,,,,

The suggestion has been made that a helper T cell defect in the immune system of the homozygotes may account for this. To further examine the immune status of these mice, we compared the ability of spleen cells of mice of both types to stimulate, as well as to generate, allogeneic cell-mediated cytolytic responses and to produce a soluble mediator of such responses. In addition, both types of mice were tested for their ability to produce interferon (IFN) or to have their splenic natural killer cell (NK) levels augmented by polyriboinosinic-polyribocytidylic acid (poly rI-rC). We found that the spleen cells of young or aging mice of either type were able to stimulate the generation of alloreactive cytotoxic cells, but they did not inappropriately stimulate the generation of syngeneic cytotoxic cells. Similarly, spleen cells of both types of mice produced a T helper cell-derived growth factor (interleukin 2) involved in the proliferation of cytolytic cells and generated a classical cell-mediated lympholysis (CML) response to alloantigen-bearing cells. Finally, spontaneous NK cell levels, as well as poly rI-rC augmented IFN and NK cell levels, were similar in both types of mice. Thus, it appears that if defects in the immune system are solely responsible for the high incidence of lymphoma in hr/hr mice, the defects involve components or regulatory aspects of that system that have yet to be defined.",,,,,

Indirect immunofluorescent staining was performed with alloantisera or with ascitic fluid as a source of monoclonal antibody followed by flow microfluorometry analysis on the fluorescence activated cell sorter. About 80% of normal, non-activated peritoneal exudate T cells, lymph node T cells and thymocytes expressed Ia antigens. These data are therefore in contrast to studies with human or murine T cells where Ia antigens were shown to be expressed predominantly on activated but not on non-activated T cells. All the reactivity of the anti-Ia alloantisera for strain 2 T cells could be removed by absorption with an Ia-bearing B cell leukaemia, EN-L2C, but not by its Ia-negative variant, BZ-L2C. Thus, the Ia determinants identified on T and B cells are probably identical. One monoclonal antibody, 25E3, which had previously been shown by serologic analysis to react exclusively with an alloantigenic determinant of strain 2 Ia antigens displayed an unusual pattern of reactivity in that it clearly stained strain 13 thymocytes, but not mature strain 13 T or B lymphocytes. The significance of this possible expression of inappropriate Ia determinants by thymocytes remains unclear. This phenomenon might be associated with differentiation processes in the thymus.",,,PMC1454417,,

The association of Pr65gag with skeletal elements can be disrupted by extraction of the cytoskeleton with sodium deoxycholate, an ionic detergent, or with buffers of high ionic strength. Both the skeleton-associated Pr65gag and its NP-40-soluble counterpart can be labeled with [3H]palmitate, indicating their probable association with lipids presumably in the plasma membrane. Pr65gag molecules bound to skeletal elements in the infected cell appear to be more stable to proteolytic processing than NP-40-soluble Pr65gag. While the association of Pr65gag with cytoskeleton elements in the cell is neither increased nor decreased by blocking virus assembly and release with interferon, Pr65gag appears to accumulate in the cytoskeleton-enriched fraction of cells chronically infected with a temperature sensitive mutant of R-MuLV (ts 17) when such cells are grown at the nonpermissive temperature.

Acute leukemia is the most frequent second neoplasia, and treatments including alkylating agents and radiotherapy seem to be correlated with a higher risk of this fatal complication. Bone and soft tissue sarcomas have rarely been observed after treatment of Hodgkin's disease, and only a few cases are described in the literature. Four cases observed at the Istituto Nazionale Tumori of Milano in a large series of nearly 800 patients treated over the last two decades with different modalities are presented. One case of chondrosarcoma and 3 cases of soft tissue sarcomas were diagnosed after a median and mean interval of 50 and 70 months, respectively (range 49-96). Three patients had been treated with radiotherapy plus chemotherapy (MOPP, 2 cases; ABVD, 1 case), and one with radiotherapy alone. The site of the second tumor was always within an irradiated area, which had received a dose ranging from 10 to 43 Gy. Prognosis of secondary bone and soft tissue sarcomas is very poor. Three of our cases died 14, 15 and 19 months after diagnosis; only one patient is alive, 3 months after diagnosis of a chondrosarcoma. The problem of second tumors in patients treated for Hodgkin's disease requires a careful evaluation of aggressive treatment modalities to minimize the risks of this severe complication.",,,,,

The BrdUrdr frequency was roughly proportional to the square of the TGr frequency and the results were compatible with the hypothesis that BrdUrdr colonies isolated after 6 EMS treatments, however, were unstable. When BrdUrdr colonies that had arisen in BrdUrd medium after 2 weeks' incubation were isolated in normal medium, the descendant cells showed a nearly normal level of thymidine incorporation and low plating efficiencies of about 1% in BrdUrd medium. In contrast, after isolation of the same colonies in BrdUrd medium, a low level of thymidine incorporation and high plating efficiencies in BrdUrd medium were observed in the descendant cells. Reverse selection from BrdUrdr to HATr was accomplished with frequencies of 10(-6)-10(-3) for the descendants grown in BrdUrd medium, and AzaCyd treatment drastically increased the reversion frequency to nearly 10(-1). Further re-revertants from HATr to BrdUrdr were also found with frequencies of 10(-3)-10(-2) without treatment.

The ability of lymphokine-induced P388D1 macrophages to present antigen plus Id was measured by their ability to induce interleukin 2 production by antigen-specific, Id-restricted T cell hybridomas in the presence of the appropriate antigen. The production of IL 2 by the T cell hybridomas is known to be dependent on the expression of Ia antigens by the antigen-presenting cells. The results obtained suggest that a factor present in the supernatant of the T cell hybridoma FS7-20.6.18 is responsible for inducing the appearance of I-Ad and I-Ed on P388D1, measured by immunofluorescence, and the ability of the cell to present antigen in association with I-Ad or I-Ed. The factor mediating the induction of antigen-presenting ability is thought to be gamma-interferon, because the hybridoma FS7-20.6.18 is known to produce this lymphokine and the factor is sensitive to pH 2 incubation. gamma-Interferon produced by recombinant DNA technology was found to induce antigen-presenting ability in this assay; however, alpha- and beta-interferon were inactive. This observation suggests a unique immunoregulatory role for gamma-interferon. Using many T cell hybridomas in the assay, we were able to distinguish three groups: a) high avidity hybridomas that respond to antigen presented by uninduced P388D1 but show an enhanced response to antigen plus induced P388D1; b) medium avidity hybridomas that do not respond to antigen presented by uninduced P388D1; and c) low avidity hybridomas that show a limited response to antigen presented by induced P388D1, but the response of which increases if the P388D1 cells are induced for longer periods of time. These different patterns of response are believed to be dependent on the Ia antigen density expressed by the gamma-interferon-induced presenting cells, and suggest that the T cell receptors for Ag/Id display marked heterogeneity in their avidities for Ag/Id.",,,,,

These clones distinguish between HLA-A2 and 21 other serologically defined HLA-A and -B antigens. In addition, most clones discriminate between prototypical HLA-A2 antigens, expressed by the majority of HLA-A2-positive individuals, and variant HLA-A2 antigens, which are serologically identical with the prototype, but distinguishable by human cytotoxic T cells and by biochemical analysis. This discrimination is reflected as an inability to cause any significant lysis of variant HLA-A2-expressing target cells at effector-to-target ratios 10- to 100-fold greater than those giving 50% lysis of prototype HLA-A2-expressing cells. By screening a panel of serologically HLA-A2-positive cells, a new variant HLA-A2-expressing cell line has been defined. The recognition patterns of these xenogeneic clones are suggested to reflect recognition of alloantigenic polymorphic determinants. Based on the strong bias in the xenogeneic T-cell repertoire for such determinants, we propose a model for T-cell recognition of class I products of the major histocompatibility complex.",,,,,

In this study, the expression of virus-related products by variant cl.18-5 cells was compared to that of AKR.H-2bSL1 cells and a susceptible clone, as an approach towards defining the virus-associated antigens recognized by anti-AKR/Gross virus CTL. Despite the type specificity of the CTL, cl.18-5 displayed normal levels of the group-specific antigen (gag) encoded proteins p30, p15, p12 and p10, and the gag-associated Gross cell surface antigen. These results were confirmed by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis employing monoclonal antibodies specific for either AKR p12 or the cell surface glycosylated form of AKR ecotropic gag product. In contrast, cl.18-5 was variably less sensitive than AKR.H-2bSL1 to the action of complement and xenogeneic antisera directed against the envelope (env) product gp70. In addition, a panel of five monoclonal antibodies to gp70, which detect distinct endogenous ecotropic viral determinants, lysed AKR.H-2bSL1, but not cl.18-5 cells. However, absorption experiments indicated that cl.18-5 did express near normal levels of these specificities, suggesting an alteration in the orientation or topographical distribution of these determinants. Consistent with an inappropriate display of env products, cl.18-5 was found to be deficient in the production of infectious ecotropic leukemia virus. The particulate fraction of the cell-free supernatant of cl.18-5 contained normal levels of reverse transcriptase activity, indicating that noninfectious viral particles were being produced. Collectively, these results point to an association between recognition by anti-AKR/Gross virus CTL and the expression of ecotropic gp70 required for infectivity of virus.",,,,,

The cl.18-5 variant was also ineffective when used as an in vivo priming cell or an in vitro stimulator cell in the generation of anti-AKR/Gross virus CTL or as an unlabeled target cell in competitive inhibition assays. These results implied that the failure of cl.18-5 to be lysed was due to a lack of recognition by the CTL. In contrast, cl.18-5 was able to be lysed by and stimulate the generation of predominantly H-2Db-restricted CTL with apparent specificity for AKR minor histocompatibility antigens.

After infection with Sendai virus (SV) or Newcastle disease virus (NDV) all cell lines produced IFN-alpha and -beta. Induction of IFN-gamma was attempted with the mitogens Con A, PHA, PWM, SEA, and SEB, with poly(I:C), with antibodies Lyt-1.2, -2.2, and Thy-1.2, or with the target cells Meth A (H-2Dd+) and RL male 1. All mitogens were effective inducers. However, the antibodies and poly(I:C) were not. One uncloned RL male 1-specific cell line CTLL-RP, produced IFN-gamma after induction with RL male 1. Production of IFN-alpha, beta depended on IL-2, whereas production of IFN-gamma did not, although addition of highly purified IL-2 increased IFN-gamma production even in the absence of other inducers. Crude IL-2 inhibited the production of IFN-gamma but not IFN-alpha, beta. In response to mitogens, some T-cell clones also produced IL-2. The results demonstrate that Lyt-2+ cells can produce a broad spectrum of lymphokine activities after appropriate stimulation. Their availability now affords us the opportunity to study the regulation of lymphokine production at the clonal level.",,,,,

Their selective toxicity is considerably high, and is chiefly due to the distribution and metabolism in the body. The selective toxicity of some DNA-binding drugs may be attributed to the structural difference of DNA, nucleosome and/or chromatin between neoplastic and normal cells. Some studies of reducing side effects are summarized. In our laboratory, we are studying drug-resistance and metastasis of tumor cells. Since the mechanism of natural resistance of gastric cancer, pulmonary cancer, and other refractory cancers may be related to acquired resistance of leukemia, studies on new agents against drug-resistant tumor cells are important. In our laboratory, we have selected cell sublines of murine T-lymphoblastoma L5178Y for resistance to adriamycin (ADM), aclarubicin (ACR) or bleomycin (BLM), and have observed that the resistance is attributed to decreased influx and increased efflux of the antibiotic, resulting in lowered retention of the drug in the cells. Each resistant subline shows a characteristic cross-resistant pattern, suggesting that membrane alteration involved differs each other. We have also found that glycoprotein-synthesizing activity and alkaline phosphodiesterase activity of plasma membrane are higher in the three resistant sublines than in the parental cell line. We obtained a number of hybridomas producing antibodies to plasma membrane of an ACR-resistant subline of L5178Y cells. Among the syngeneic monoclonal antibodies, one was found by agglutination tests to react with the ACR-resistant cell line, but not significantly with the parental and ADM-, BLM-and MCR-resistant cell lines. Fluorographs of [14C] leucine-labeled ACR-resistant cells demonstrates two protein bands of 230 K and 20 K daltons, which are precipitated by the monoclonal antibody. The former seems to be specific to the ACR-resistant cells. Based on the results so far obtained, the 230 K protein may be related to the drug resistance and may be TATA (tumor-associated transplantation antigen). The results suggest that isolation of drug-resistant neoplastic cells is a novel method of finding TATA.",,14,,,

Neoplastic cells from patients infected with HTLV generally express receptors for T-cell growth factor (TCGF) (interleukin-2), and do not require prior activation with antigens or lectins to undergo TCGF-induced proliferation. Furthermore, neoplastic T-cell lines originating from such patients may constitutively produce TCGF, TCGF receptors and HTLV virions. HTLV is transmissible from cell to cell, and the infection of human T cells in vitro is associated with the expression of TCGF receptors, which can be identified by the monoclonal antibody termed anti-Tac. In our experience to date, T-cell populations that produce HTLV without exception also express epitopes found on TCGF receptors. Recognition of an association between HTLV virions and the Tac antigen would have clinical and theoretical implications. We now present evidence that during the replication or release of HTLV, the virion becomes preferentially associated with the Tac antigen.",,,,,

Using a peroxidase staining technique, NDS15.38 was shown to react with phytohemagglutin (PHA)-stimulated lymphocytes and with apparently activated B cells in the germinal centers of lymph nodes from individuals who were tissue typed as HLA-DR2.

Surface marker study of six neoplastic human T cell lines suggested that F(ab')2- and mu-cross-reactive determinants may be expressed independently of alpha-cross-reactive determinants. F(ab')2-cross-reactive materials--F(ab')2-CRMs--were then isolated from several T-cell lines and analysed by reverse passive haemagglutination and in immunoprecipitation experiments by polyacrylamide disc gel electrophoresis in buffers containing sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS-PAGE) under reducing conditions. It was shown that MOLT-4- and CCRF-CEM-derived F(ab')2-CRMs differ serologically and that alpha- are indeed expressed independently of F(ab')2- and mu-cross-reactive determinants. The F(ab')2-CRMs were shown to be T cell-derived, to express determinants similar to or identical with F(ab')2-cross-reactive determinants expressed in normal T-cell membranes and to correspond closely to T-cell antigen binding molecules. Evidence was also obtained that the two F(ab')2-CRMs differ from one another in molecular weight. SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions of MOLT-4- and CCRF-CEM-derived F(ab')2-CRMs identified major components of mol. wt. 135,000 and mol. wt. 330,000 respectively.

Titration of rRNA or thymus DNA with AO results in formation of such products suggesting that the dye, per se, denatures double-stranded (ds) sections of these biopolymers. This transition, measured as the increase of red luminescence, a concomitant decrease of green fluorescence, and followed by an increase of light scatter of the AO-nucleic acid complexes, is cooperative and at 0.15 N NaCl occurs at 4-20 and 10-50 microM range of AO concentration for rRNA and DNA, respectively. The changes in stainability of nucleic acids in situ, in permealized cells, occur at higher AO concentration. Thus, the transition of RNA in situ is biphasic and seen at 20-120 microM AO. In the presence of EDTA, however, the change is monophasic and shifted to the 10-30 microM range of AO concentration. The change in stainability of DNA also shows two phases: one at 30-60 microM and another at 70-120 microM of AO. Extraction of basic proteins with 0.08 N HCl shifts the transition of DNA to the 30-60 microM AO concentration and makes it monophasic. The observed differences in denaturability of RNA vs DNA explain the specificity of AO in differential staining of these bipolymers in histochemical reactions. In living cells the products of interaction of AO with nucleic acids are detected by electron microscopy. In the cytoplasm of interphase cells the formation of dense precipitates within ribosomes and polysomes, simultaneous with a specific retraction of ribosome-polysome complexes from the periphery of the cell to the nucleus is evident. The latter suggests higher order organization of these particles involving their association with each other or with the nucleus via polyanionic macromolecules which collapse upon binding with AO. The DNA in heterochromatin is more sensitive to AO-induced denaturation, as evidenced by the fact that the dense complexes are formed preferentially in the regions of condensed chromatin of the interphase nucleus, or in metaphase chromosomes.",,,,,

In contrast, incorporation of exogenous deoxyadenosine into DNA is unchanged under the same conditions. Interferon treatment results in a lowering of thymidine kinase activity, an effect which may be largely responsible for the inhibition of incorporation of labelled thymidine into DNA. At higher concentrations of exogenous thymidine, which minimize the contribution of intracellular sources to the dTTP pool, the inhibition of thymidine incorporation is abolished. Under conditions in which exogenous thymidine is rigorously excluded from the medium or, conversely, in which cells are entirely dependent on exogenous thymidine for growth, the magnitude of the inhibition of cell proliferation by interferons is the same as under normal culture conditions. We conclude that, even though cell growth is impaired, the rate of DNA synthesis is not grossly inhibited up to 48 h after commencement of interferon treatment. Furthermore, changes in neither the utilization of exogenous thymidine nor the synthesis of nucleotides de novo are responsible for the effect on cell proliferation.",,,PMC1152341,,

To facilitate the identification of tyrosine kinase substrates, we developed monoclonal antibodies to the hapten azobenzylphosphonate. One of these antibodies, MA-2G8, proved to be especially attractive in that it bound a derivative of aminophenylphosphate, a close phosphotyrosine analog, with higher affinity than it bound the corresponding derivative of aminobenzylphosphonate; however, its affinity for phosphoserine was negligible. In this paper we describe the optimal conditions for using this antibody to isolate phosphotyrosine proteins, emphasizing particularly that its interaction with phosphotyrosyl proteins is sensitive to ionic detergents and to antibody density on the immunosorbent matrix. The antibody also bound ATP citrate lyase; this enzyme lacks phosphotyrosine but contains phosphohistidine, which is similar structurally to phosphotyrosine. By attaching the antibody at high density to Sepharose beads and omitting ionic detergents from the buffers, it was possible by microbatch immunoadsorption (followed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) to isolate the 120,000-dalton transforming protein and several other phosphotyrosyl proteins from cells transformed by Abelson murine leukemia virus. Under the same conditions, phosphotyrosyl proteins were also isolated from human epidermal carcinoma cells (A431) that had been stimulated with epidermal growth factor; most prominent among these proteins was the 170,000-dalton receptor for epidermal growth factor.",,,PMC369980,,

From studies to the possible mechanism(s) leading to the defects in the immune system, it appeared that the accumulation of deoxyATP and deoxyGTP and the subsequent inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase played an important role. The inhibition of methylation pathways through the accumulation of s-adenosylmethionine seems to be a second valid concept. The amount to which certain subtypes of lymphoid cells were affected by the enzyme deficiencies was strongly related to the enzymatic make-up of the cells. Lymphoid cells from different maturation stages could be affected in a specific way, depending on the different enzyme activities of these cells. Studies on human lymphoblastic leukemias showed that, related to the immunological subtype, the different leukemias could be characterized by a different enzymatic make-up. In this paper we discuss the possibilities for a specific enzyme directed chemotherapy, directed against specific subtypes of human lymphoblastic leukemias. Experimental evidence indicates that for example the adenosine deaminase inhibitor 2'deoxycoformycin can be used as a specific drug against acute lymphoblastic leukemia with the T cell phenotype.",,199,,,

The most common contributing causes of death for rats in both groups were large granular lymphocyte (LGL) leukemia and pituitary tumors. PB decreased the incidence of LGL leukemia but increased the incidence and multiplicity of hepatocellular GGT-positive foci, eosinophilic foci, and eosinophilic hepatocellular adenomas. GGT-positive eosinophilic foci increased in diameter and volume, but not in number, after appearing early in the experiment. Hepatocellular basophilic foci and neoplasms in aged control rats were usually GGT-negative and did not appear to respond to dietary PB. GGT-positive foci were seen in aged control rat livers and were composed of vacuolated amphophilic hepatocytes that differed morphologically from hepatocytes in naturally occurring liver tumors. Young rats given PB had few GGT-positive foci by 150 days on test. Aged rat livers were thus more sensitive to the effects of PB than were livers of young rats.",,,,,

By this method, the determined potential of these cells, passively sensitized with IgE, is -93 +/- 5 mV (mean +/- SEM, interior negative). Almost 40% of this membrane potential is rapidly collapsed upon the addition of the proton carrier, carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenyl hydrazone (FCCP). It is suggested that the FCCP-sensitive fraction of the total membrane potential results from the accumulation of this cation by the mitochondria, which maintains a negative membrane potential. Thus, the resting plasma membrane potential of these cells equals -55 +/- 6 mV. During the process of immunological stimulation by antibodies directed against cell membrane bound IgE, the membrane potential decreases. Moreover, there is a correlation between the extent of degranulation of the cells and the depolarization. It is concluded that in common with other secretory systems, depolarization of the plasma membrane is involved in the stimulus-secretion coupling of the histamine secreting RBL cells.",,,,,

Cell suspensions depleted of Thy-1.2+, Lyt-1+, or Lyt-2+ lymphocytes had no significant GVL reactivity, whereas suspensions depleted of NK-1.2+ cells retained GVL reactivity. The GVL-reactive cells persisted in H-2-compatible donor mice for up to 56 days. Lyt-1+2+ lymphocytes that were cytotoxic for cultured AKR leukemia cells in vitro could be detected in the spleens of alloimmunized H-2-compatible mice after expansion of the cells in T cell growth factor. Using quantitative limiting dilution cytotoxicity assays, we found that the frequency of leukemia-reactive cytotoxic lymphocytes (CL) in the spleen showed a direct correlation with the GVL efficacy of the cells in vivo. Alloimmunization was essential for induction of the GVL-reactive cell population. CL in alloimmunized mice consisted of heterogeneous cytotoxic specificities; i.e., some CL were leukemia-specific, others lysed only nonleukemic AKR target cells, and a third group mediated killing of both leukemic and nonleukemic target cells. The CL appeared to be H-2 restricted and specific for non-H-2 antigens shared by the AKR leukemia and the alloimmunizing cells.",,,,,

Gelatin and poly-L-lysine interacted mainly with different components at pH 7.2, whereas common components appeared to be involved at pH 5.5. Concanavalin A interacted preferentially with components that it shared with lysozyme at both pH values. In addition to variations in interactions with changes in pH and type of compound, variations occurred with changes in concentration of the compounds and with their sequence of addition to the cells. Comparative studies with horse red blood cells showed that the interactions differed markedly with cell type.",,,,,

Deletion of gag coding sequence from the A-MuLV protein did not affect fibroblast transforming activity but abolished lymphoid transforming activity. The gag- A-MuLV genomes were very unstable in transformed fibroblasts leading to large secondary deletions in v-abl sequences. The gag- A-MuLV proteins also had lower autophosphorylation than their gag+ counterparts although cells transformed by gag- virus had a normal elevation of protein-linked phosphotyrosine. Systematic deletion of v-abl sequences showed that only 45,000 to the 130,000 molecular weight of v-abl sequence in the A-MuLV protein is needed for fibroblast transformation and, at most, slightly more is needed for lymphoid cell transformation.",,,,,

Autologous serum reactivity was detectable by PA in four cases and by IA and C3-MHA in about half the patients. Autologous serum reactivity occurred more often in ALL than in ANLL. Absorption studies revealed that in one patient only the autologous reactivity was directed against a restricted antigen, which could be detected only on the individual T-ALL blast cells. All other autologous antibodies detected unspecific antigens. Neuraminidase treatment had two effects: first, it increased antibody attachment to antigens which are also present on untreated cells; secondly, after neuraminidase treatment an antigen was detectable on the cell surface which could also be demonstrated on neuraminidase-treated non-leukemic cells (e.g., erythrocytes). Neither of these two effects of neuraminidase treatment seems to be tumor-specific.

Twenty-two T-cell neoplasms, expressing a variety of intrathymic and mature peripheral phenotypes, expressed Leu 1, but this expression was heterogeneous with respect to percent-positive cells and antigenic density, and appeared to correlate with stages of T-cell differentiation. This study demonstrated the expression of Leu 1 by 33 of 36 cases of B-CLL, by 10 of 15 cases of the closely allied small lymphocytic cell lymphoma, and by 9 of 29 follicular center-cell lymphomas. This included B-cell malignancies of each surface immunoglobulin isotype, and some cases associated with a monoclonal protein spike. Leu 1 was not expressed by myeloma plasma cells, and was absent from non-B, non-T acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells in each of 15 cases studied. Finally, Leu 1 and OKT1 were expressed in parallel, with respect to percent-positive cells and staining intensity, on benign and malignant T-cells, and on malignant B-cells, wherever studied.

In addition, the interaction with M phi of both neuraminidase-treated and untreated IFLE was found to be influenced by a heat-stable serum factor. gamma-globulin markedly enhanced the weak IFLE-M phi interaction which occurred at low serum concentration suggesting that the heat-stable factor may be an immunoglobulin.

Therefore, the low NK cell activity observed during remission is not solely attributable to inadequate secretion of interferon in the host.

Ion exchange chromatography of tissue extracts resolved six peaks of radioactivity believed to represent methotrexate and metabolites with up to 4 additional glutamyl residues. Polyglutamate formation in L1210 cells and small intestine was shown to be independent of dose at least to 400 mg/kg as long as intracellular levels of drug in excess of the dihydrofolate reductase binding capacity (exchangeable) were maintained. Both the total amount of polyglutamates and the average length of the polyglutamyl chain increased with time as long as exchangeable level of drug were present intracellularily. The results also showed differences in the extent of metabolism of methotrexate polyglutamates among the tissues examined. Although, these differences were at times very large, there was no consistent correlation between these differences and other pharmacologic parameters or cytoxicity. Tumor cells appeared to synthesize more polyglutamates than the normal tissues examined. However, differences in total drug persistence and sensitivity to drug among tumor cells and among normal tissues did not reflect the relative extent of polyglutamate synthesis in each group. We observed no selective retention of polyglutamates as compared to methotrexate by L1210 cells in vitro as indicated by the extracellular accumulation during efflux of methotrexate and the polyglutamates. This could only be demonstrated by allowing efflux of intracellular drug in the presence of extracellular dihydrofolate reductase, which averted hydrolysis of the polyglutamates.

The expression of the viral antigen was examined during establishment of 8 of the 10 cell lines. The viral antigen was not expressed in leukemic cells before cultivation. In 5 lines, the viral antigen was detected by immunofluorescent staining after a short period of cultivation. However, 3 cell lines, ATL-6A, ATL-9Y, and ATL-1K did not express the viral antigen during short-term culture: the ATL-6A and ATL-9Y cell lines became positive for the viral antigen after 5 and 2 months of cultivation, respectively; the ATL-1K cell line remained antigen-negative throughout a culture period of 13 months. Southern blot hybridization assay showed that all of the cell lines, including the viral antigen-negative ATL-1K cell line, contained the viral genome. Thus, the retrovirus was associated with all 10 cell lines established from ATL patients, but there was a heterogeneity in the expression time of the retroviral antigen in leukemic cells maintained in vitro.

Certain oncogenic murine leukemia viruses contain similar inhibitory activity and the active component of the retroviruses was shown to be the envelope protein P15E. A number of murine malignant and nonmalignant cell lines, as well as primary tumors, have now been examined to determine whether production of retroviral P15E or a related protein is characteristic of neoplastic cells. Tumor lines examined included the Hep 129 hepatocarcinoma, BP8 fibrosarcoma, RL1 lymphoma, and three variants of the B16 melanoma. Tumor lines were virus negative by electron microscopy. Nonmalignant cells examined included ST0, 3T3/BALB, and 3T3/L1 fibroblasts and unstimulated, as well as mitogen-stimulated murine splenocytes. Cells were pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine, proteins immunoprecipitated with two monoclonal antibodies to P15E and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and gel fluorography. All tumor lines synthesized a approximately 19,000-dalton protein that co-migrated with retroviral P15E on SDS-PAGE. None of the nonmalignant cells synthesized this protein. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of the proteins precipitated from two B16 melanoma lines by monoclonal anti-P15E showed them to be physicochemically similar to P15E from Rauscher leukemia virus. A competition ELISA assay for P15E was developed and confirmed the results obtained by metabolic labeling and demonstrated P15E-related antigens in the tumor cell lines and also in the ascites fluid of mice injected with Hep 129 cells. More importantly, P15E antigens were expressed in both a spontaneous mammary adenocarcinoma and in a primary methylcholanthrene-induced fibrosarcoma. Nonmalignant tissues from animals bearing these tumors contained no detectable P15E antigen. Extracts from the primary fibrosarcomas, when injected into the thighs of mice, inhibited the intraperitoneal accumulation of inflammatory macrophages. The inhibitory activity was specifically removed by absorption with monoclonal antibody to P15E. These results suggest that synthesis of the immunosuppressive retroviral protein P15E, or a very similar protein, routinely occurs during the growth of murine neoplastic cells. This P15E-related protein is present in spontaneous murine primary tumors as well as in all murine tumor cell lines tested. The expression of such proteins by transformed cells in vivo could confer a selective advantage for their sustained growth since they would be more likely to escape immune surveillance.",,,PMC2187113,,

Normal human sera contained low levels of Leu-2 antigen but sera from Leu-2-positive leukemia patients had high levels.

To assess the significance of this finding, the relationship between hypoxanthine concentration and the rate of purine nucleotide synthesis by the de novo pathway was studied in normal human bone marrow mononuclear cells and in the human promyelocytic cell line, HL-60, in vitro. Utilizing a [14C]formate incorporation technique, rates of total cellular de novo purine synthesis as well as rates of de novo adenine, de novo guanine, and thymine synthesis and incorporation into RNA and DNA were measured as a function of hypoxanthine concentration. In normal human marrow cells, the rate of total de novo purine synthesis declined by 81%, while the rate of de novo adenine and de novo guanine synthesis and incorporation into macromolecules declined by 89 and 75%, respectively, when media hypoxanthine was increased from 0 to 10 microM. Similar results were seen in the HL-60 cell line. In contrast, rates of thymine synthesis and incorporation into DNA as well as overall rates of RNA and DNA synthesis did not change with varying media hypoxanthine concentrations. In addition, hypoxanthine salvage and incorporation into RNA and DNA was shown to progressively increase with increasing media hypoxanthine concentrations. These results indicate that physiologic concentrations of hypoxanthine are sufficient to regulate the rate of de novo purine synthesis in human bone marrow in vivo.",,,PMC1129262,,

P388AD tumor cells presented TGG to long-term cultures of TGG-reactive T cells (LTTC) and to lymph node-derived T cells which were enriched on nylon wool columns and subsequently depleted of endogenous antigen-presenting cells with anti-Ia antisera and complement. MHC-restricted antigen presentation by P388AD was observed when long-term cultures of TGG-reactive T cells were used as the responding T-cell population. Furthermore, antisera directed against I-region determinants expressed on the P388AD tumor cells inhibited TGG-specific T-cell proliferation in a dose-related fashion, suggesting a functional role for the tumor cell-associated Ia molecules. The kinetics of antigen presentation to LTTC by P388AD were similar to the kinetics observed for splenic APC, although the magnitude of the proliferative response to LTTC to TGG was generally lower when antigen (Ag) was presented by the tumor cells compared to splenic antigen-presenting cells (APC). However, the magnitude of T-cell proliferation of immune lymph node (LN) T cells was comparable when Ag was presented on tumor cells or splenic APC. Several experiments suggested that Ag uptake and/or processing may be less effective in P388AD tumor cells as compared to normal splenic APC. A nonadherent Ia+, IL-1- tumor cell line (P388NA), which was isolated from the same parental tumor as P388AD, was also tested for the ability to present Ag to primed T lymphocytes and Ag-reactive LTTC. In contrast, to P388AD, the nonadherent tumor cell failed to present TGG under identical culture conditions even though Ia molecules were expressed on the tumor cells and Ag uptake had occurred. However, the defect in Ag presentation by P388NA could be corrected if an exogenous source of purified interleukin 1 was supplied to the cultures. A unique opportunity thus exists with both the P388AD and P388NA tumor cell lines to decipher some of the molecular interactions leading to T-cell proliferation during antigen presentation.",,,,,

These studies were performed using a highly specific ion-pairing high-pressure liquid chromatography method which permits the simultaneous determination of methotrexate, 7-hydroxymethotrexate, and their corresponding polyglutamyl derivatives. When MOLT 4 cells were exposed to 1 microM methotrexate, the monoglutamate attained a steady state after 30 min, and polyglutamyl derivatives having from one to 4 additional glutamyl residues were observed over 4 hr. Four additional metabolites were also detected upon incubation with 1 microM 7-hydroxymethotrexate. On the basis of the retention times for these compounds relative to methotrexate polyglutamyl standards and since these metabolites reverted to 7-hydroxymethotrexate upon treatment with a preparation of hog kidney conjugase, they were identified as polyglutamyl derivatives of 7-hydroxymethotrexate. The identification of 7-hydroxymethotrexate polyglutamyl derivatives in vitro raises the possibility of an important new dimension in the pharmacological action of methotrexate. We investigated the effect of extracellular 7-hydroxymethotrexate on net methotrexate uptake and metabolism when cells were exposed simultaneously to 1 microM [3H]-methotrexate and unlabeled 7-hydroxymethotrexate. A decrease in the levels of both intracellular methotrexate and the corresponding polyglutamyl derivatives was noted for cells treated with 1 or 10 microM 7-hydroxymethotrexate. However, no appreciable effect of 7-hydroxymethotrexate on the amount of polyglutamyl derivatives formed relative to the total intracellular antifolate was noted. These studies show that in MOLT 4 cells (a) both methotrexate and 7-hydroxymethotrexate are rapidly converted to polyglutamyl derivatives, and (b) 7-hydroxymethotrexate interferes with net methotrexate accumulation and metabolism when present simultaneously in the extracellular medium. These results, moreover, suggest a potential role for 7-hydroxymethotrexate in modulating the biochemical effects of methotrexate in vivo.",,,,,

The fraction of bone marrow cells in S- and G2-phase was higher in primary acquired sideroblastic anemia and refractory anemia (without excess of blasts) than in refractory anemia with excess of blasts and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. Regardless to the diagnosis, the patients with low fraction of cells in S- and G2-phase had short survival time and showed high rate of evolution into acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia. The labeling (LI) and mitotic (MI) indexes of both erythroblasts and granulocytic cells were decreased in nearly all patients. The lowest values of LI and MI of the granulocytic compartment were found in the patients who subsequently developed acute leukemia.

The morphologic appearance of the leukemic cells coupled with the results of cytochemical staining reactions (alpha-naphthyl AS-D chloroacetate esterase, alpha-naphthyl butyrate esterase, Sudan black B, and periodic acid-Schiff reaction) identified this leukemia as myelomonocytic in origin. APL-like Auer rods in AMML now can be included in the spectrum of morphologic forms commonly seen in myelogenous leukemia and lends support to the hypothesis of an aberrant stem cell. In addition to the APL-like Auer rods, the leukemic blasts contained giant pink-staining granules on Wright's stain, some of which had a tubular substructure similar to the Auer rods under the electron microscope.

As Ig heavy and light chain genes must both undergo a DNA rearrangement during B-cell development but rarely do so within other hematopoietic lineages, we examined these genes in this leukemia. The neoplastic cells of all eight cases demonstrated rearranged heavy and light chain genes and, in two cases examined, contained the corresponding mRNA for heavy and light chain Ig. Consistent with this B-cell genotype, all cases displayed cell surface HLA-DR and B-cell-associated antigens. Unexpectedly, all cases demonstrated cell surface Tac antigen, which previously had been restricted predominantly to select T-cell malignancies and activated T cells. Prior studies suggested that the anti-Tac monoclonal antibody recognized a peptide associated with the binding of interleukin 2 (T-cell growth factor) in such T cells. Immunoprecipitation with anti-Tac and NaDodSO4/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed an antigen on leukemic hairy cells with a Mr of 53,000-57,000, identical in size to the receptor on activated T cells. This apparent biphenotypic status might reflect a transformation-associated expression of the Tac antigen in this leukemia.

Alpha and beta-interferons cause a modest but significant increase in these receptors.

Therefore, production as well as maintenance of ara-CTP in the cells is a function of both phosphorylation and deamination of ara-C, but is more dependent on the latter, because the deamination is several times superior to the former in terms of enzymatic activities. In chemotherapy with ara-C, the rate of the inactivation should be estimated for evaluating antitumor effect of the agent. Determination of serum or plasma deaminase activity can be a useful parameter of the inactivation. Attempts have been made to enhance the antitumor activity of ara-C by preventing deamination and a number of ara-C derivatives resistant to the deamination such as cyclocytidine, ara-C-5'-ester and acyl ara-C have been introduced. Cyclo-C gradually receives non-enzymatic hydrolysis to produce ara-C in neutral medium, which is useful for maintaining plasma ara-C level. Acyl ara-C such as behenoyl-ara-C (BHAC) is well incorporated into the cells and is highly distributed to lipophilic components such as membrane, microsome and mitochondria in the cells. The extremely gradual conversion of BHAC to ara-C in the cells is considered to be useful for maintaining effective intracellular concentration. A part of BHAC could be phosphorylated before deacylation. After intravenous administration of BHAC, the plasma drug concentrations are maintained significantly longer than those after the administration of the equivalent dose of ara-C. Therefore, BHAC is more resistant to the deamination than cyclo-C and the antitumor effect of the former is suspected to be milder but prolonged than that of ara-C or cyclo-C.",,31,,,

The recent advances are summarized. Screening of microorganism for new antitumor antibiotics based upon our studies on mechanism of action are currently ongoing. We are interested in drug-resistance of tumor cells, and have obtained drug-resistant sublines of murine lymphoblastoma L5178Y cells. We have found that glycoprotein synthesis and alkaline phosphodiesterase (APD) activity of the plasma membrane are higher in adriamycin (ADM)-, aclarubicin (ACR)- and bleomycin (BLM)-resistant cell sublines than in the parental cells. An inhibitor of APD has been isolated from a soil Streptomyces, and identified with 2-crotonyloxymethyl-4,5,6-trihydroxycyclohex-2-enone (COTC). COTC inhibits growth of the drug-resistant cells more significantly than the parental cells, and exhibits synergistic activity with ACR against ACR-resistant cells. COTC is a SH inhibitor. Although COTC is a multifunctional drug, the inhibition of DNA polymerase alpha and some mitotic process may be related to its lethal action. In the course of our screening, we have found that a strain of Sterptomyces hygroscopicus produces two substances: one inhibits thymidine and uridine uptake of human leukemic K562 cells, and the other stimulates it. The inhibiting substance has been identified with tubercidin, and the stimulating one has been found to be a novel pyrrolo [2,3-d] pyrimidine antibiotic, cadeguomycin. Cadeguomycin shows low acute toxicity in mice, enhances DTH reaction, and inhibits Ehrlich ascitic carcinoma in mice. The antibiotic exhibits synergistic effects with arabinosylcytosine against growth of K562 cells. Saframycin, discovered by Prof. Arai, Chiba University, is effective against Ehrlich ascitic carcinoma, P388 and L1210 leukemia, and B16 melanoma in mice. The target is DNA. Stubomycin, discovered by Dr. Umezawa, Kitasato Institute, is effective against Sarcoma 180, Ehrlich carcinoma, P388 leukemia, IMC carcinoma and Meth-A tumor in mice, and shows low acute toxicity.

We have comparatively investigated cardiac and dermal toxicity of 12 kinds of anthracycline antibiotics and mitoxantrone, using golden hamsters. Of the drugs examined, ACM, THP, AD-32 and AD-143 cause much less cardiomyopathy and alopecia than the other agents. The results have been confirmed by electron microscopic studies. Bestatin is an immunorestorator, which recovers immunological functions decreased in aged animals.

Six ANLL patients who failed to remit on standard daunorubicin-cytosine arabinoside programs also failed to remit on the m-AMSA-AZA combination. Two patients with relapsed acute lymphatic leukemia (ALL) also failed while two patients with chronic myelocytic leukemia (CML) in evolution were cytoreduced. The seven patients who achieved remission had additional relapse-free survival for a median of six months (range 1-23+ months). One patient obtained a second remission with m-AMSA-AZA after relapse which followed a 9-month period of nonmaintained remission. Most patients demonstrated mild to moderate nausea and vomiting. Hepatic toxicity was mild to infrequent. Only four patients showed cardiac toxicity which was not life-threatening.

The first study might be a comparison of relapsed prior-remitting ANLL with single-agent m-AMSA. The second, in untreated ANLL, following induction with DAT, might use m-AMSA-AZA in consolidation and maintenance arms of future protocols.

The resulting activation and proliferation of T cells involves the production and utilization of several lymphokines or interleukins. This report describes experiments wherein these events could be separated into two phases, T cell activation and T cell proliferation. The first phase was achieved by stimulating antigen-specific T cell lines with antigen-pulsed ultraviolet light-irradiated accessory cells. T cell proliferation (second phase) could then be initiated by the addition of a soluble lymphokine with the characteristics of interleukin 1 (IL 1). These effects were only observed with homologous antigen and accessory cells syngeneic to the T cells at the I-A and E/C subregion of the MHC. This report has two applications in the study of lymphocyte-lymphokine interactions. First, T cell recognition of antigen and antigen-induced T cell proliferation can be examined as physically separate events. Secondly, this system may be used as a specific and sensitive means of measuring the effects of IL 1 on T cells.",,,,,

We developed an indirect immunofluorescent technique to stain lymphocytes conjugated to K-562 tumour cells in agarose with monoclonal antibodies. This allowed assessment of lymphocyte subpopulations binding to tumour cells without disruption of conjugates. Overall binding of non-adherent (NA) lymphocytes to tumour targets following incubation at 37 degrees C for 6 h was 13.3 +/- 0.3% compared to 12.5 +/- 0.7% with inclusion of IFN at 100 u/ml. When NA lymphocytes were incubated with K-562 tumour cells without IFN, OKM1 and OKT3 staining lymphocytes comprised 16.8 +/- 3.5% and 83.0 +/- 1.3% of the total lymphocyte population and 32.5 +/- 1.3% and 70.2 +/- 2.6% of lymphocytes conjugated to tumours. Incubation with IFN significantly increased OKM1 staining cells in the total NA population to 57.2 +/- 5.6% (P less than 0.01) and within tumour conjugates to 59.2 +/- 2.7% (P less than 0.01) while OKT3 staining cells decreased to 58.3 +/- 5.2% (P less than 0.02) and 45.3 +/- 1.2% (P less than 0.01), respectively. IFN increased cytotoxicity of NA cells for 51Cr-labelled K-562 by 66% at an effector to target ratio of 30:1 (P less than 0.001). These results demonstrate that OKM1 staining cells bind more avidly to tumour targets in the absence of IFN. IFN selectively increases the proportion of OKM1 staining lymphocytes with a concomitant increase in their binding to tumour cells. Therefore, enhancement of cytotoxicity by IFN in the NK system may result, in part, from conversion of OKT3 to OKM1 staining cells which are more efficient killers.",,,PMC1535559,,

The consequences of such a modulation were correlated with the therapeutic efficacy of this combination in mice bearing L1210 leukemia. In vitro and in vivo treatment of both L1210 sublines with DAUR produced a dose- and time-dependent reduction in the CTP and dCTP pools and an increase in the UTP pool. In addition to these changes in the pyrimidine nucleotide pools, DAUR produced a modest increase in the GTP pool and a marked expansion of the ATP pool in L1210/ara-C 12 hrs following in vivo drug treatment. These perturbations in nucleoside triphosphate pools were more pronounced in L1210/ara-C cells. Treatment of mice bearing L1210/ara-C with 100 mg/kg of DAUR reduced the CTP and dCTP pools in the leukemic cells by greater than 90% within 1-3 hrs after administration of the drug, with complete recovery of these pools occurring within 12 hrs. Fluctuation of the pyrimidine nucleoside pools after DAUR treatment was correlated with the subsequent increase in aza-CR metabolism and its incorporation into RNA and with the potentiation of the in vivo toxicity of aza-CR. In mice bearing L1210/0 or L1210/ara-C tumors, DAUR or aza-CR produced a less than or equal to 23% increase in life-span (ILS). Administration of aza-CR 3 hrs after DAUR, however, produced about an 80% ILS among mice bearing L1210/ara-C tumors, but no more than an approximately 20% ILS among mice bearing L1210/0 tumors. These data suggest that the therapeutic activity of the sequential combination of DAUR and aza-CR against mice bearing L1210/ara-C cannot be explained, per se, on the basis of the initial intracellular modulation of nucleotide pools, since DAUR affected these pools of the two tumors to approximately the same degree. What appears to be important, however, is that such a modulation by DAUR preferentially affected the metabolism of aza-CR in leukemic cells resistant to ara-C which are devoid of deoxycytidine kinase activity.",,,,,

The DNA of L1210 leukemia cells was isolated from 5-aza-dCyd-treated mice and tested for its ability to accept methyl groups from S-adenosyl-L-methionine in a reaction catalyzed by DNA methyltransferase. The methyl-accepting ability of leukemia cell DNA was found to be dependent on the dose of 5-aza-dCyd, suggesting that this therapy induced significant changes in the level of methylation of the DNA. At the start of the 5-aza-dCyd infusion, mice were given i.p. injections of [6-3H]uridine, and the DNA of the L1210 leukemia cells was isolated at the end of therapy. Analysis of the labeled pyrimidine bases showed that 5-aza-dCyd produced a dose-dependent reduction in the 5-methylcytosine content of the DNA.

Drug-induced tumour cell kill was assessed by differential staining of dead and live cells such that the latter could be morphologically identified, with subsequent calculation of tumour cell viability. Concentrations of drug for use in the assay were chosen for chlorambucil (2 micrograms ml-1), 4-hydroperoxy-cyclophosphamide (2 micrograms ml-1)--which was used in vitro in place of cyclophosphamide--prednisolone (0.5 microgram ml-1) and vincristine (0.1 microgram ml-1), to give a scatter of values which was in good agreement with clinical expectations.

Strong sudan black, nonspecific esterase, and chloroacetate esterase reaction was obtained only for myelocytic and monocytic cell lines with the reaction intensity increasing progressively in more mature cells. Focal acid phosphatase reaction like T-ALL was found in all T-ALL cell lines, whereas myeloid/monocytoid lines had semicircular distribution and B-cell lines cytoplasmic distribution of activity. Acid phosphatase activity appeared to decline with maturation along both myeloid and T-cell lineage. High activity of alpha-naphthyl acetate esterase and alpha-naphthyl butyrate esterase both at pH 5.8 and 8.0 and of beta-glucuronidase was found in myeloid/monocytoid lines although both B- and T-cell lines in contrast to peripheral blood B-cells also had significant esterase activity. alpha-Naphthyl butyrate esterase activity declined with increasing cell maturation along myeloid lineage. Except for weak activity in two B-cell lines alkaline phosphatase was not detected in any cell lines. Monocyte esterase activity was inhibited by sodium fluoride whereas acid phosphatase, only from hairy cell leukaemia line, was resistant to L-tartarate. Although periodic acid Schiff's staining could not distinguish myeloid, T-, B-, or non-T/non-B cell lines it gave characteristic reaction (large number of coarse granules against a clear background forming a ring around the nucleus) with erythroblastic leukaemia cell line and along myeloid series its intensity increased in more mature cells. Deoxyribonuclease II and chymotrypsin-like protease staining were not discriminatory. The results of this study show that cytochemical staining characteristics of various leukaemia/lymphoma cell lines are comparable to those of corresponding cells from patients and that the intensity and pattern of expression of these activities are related to cell type and degree of cell maturation. These studies give further credence to the use of these cell lines in cell differentiation, differential drug cytotoxicity, and many other studies.",,,PMC2011361,,

Both the phenylthiazole and phenylbithiazole derivatives exhibit high-field shifts for their hydrogens in the presence of the polynucleotide which are considerably larger than those observed in the analogous completely heterocyclic systems studied previously (Sakai, T.T.; Riordan, J.M.; Glickson, J.D. Biochemistry 1982, 21, 805). The intercalative nature of the binding of these analogues was further indicated by viscometric measurements using calf thymus DNA. The data show that a phenyl ring allows the aromatic systems to interact with the base pairs of the polynucleotide to a greater extent than a thiazole ring in the same position. Possible models for the interaction of these derivatives with DNA are considered. The hydrogens of the biphenyl derivative show an interaction that is substantially less than those observed in the heterocycle-containing systems, suggesting that the ring system is oriented improperly or that the ring system is nonplanar. The analogous phenyl (benzoyl) compound does not bind, showing the requirement for an extended aromatic system for intercalation. The utility of these observations for the design of possible synthetic analogues of the bleomycins is discussed.

The present paper describes the characterization of these bands and the factor that determines the degree of glycolipid exposure at the cell surface and its antigenicity. 1) The resolution of ganglio-N-triaosylceramide into three bands was found to be due to molecules having different fatty acid compositions. Band a contained nervonic (C24:1) and lignoceric (C24:0) acids, band b contained palmitic acid (C16:0), and band c contained alpha-hydroxypalmitic acid. 2) Surface labeling of L5178c127 cells with galactose oxidase/sodium borotritide, followed by fluorography of the isolated glycolipids, revealed that all three bands were exposed on the surface of the cell. However, treatment of cells with sialidase before treatment with galactose oxidase resulted in a 10-fold increase of label incorporated into ganglio-N-triaosylceramide. Since no sialylated form of ganglio-N-triaosylceramide was detected on these cells, and no change in the chemical amount of this glycolipid could be detected, the increase of label into this molecule was due to the exposure by sialidase of a normally cryptic glycolipid. The exposure of ganglio-N-triaosylceramide after sialidase treatment was also reflected by the increased sensitivity of these cells to monoclonal antibodies to the glycolipid and complement after enzyme treatment. Thus, the results provide clear evidence that crypticity, as well as antigenicity, of a membrane glycolipid is determined by the degree of sialylation in a second membrane glycoconjugate.",,,,,

Cells resistant to vincristine (L1210/VCR) showed impaired capability to take up the drug at 20 degrees. Its initial uptake in L1210 sublines in vitro was: L1210/0 greater than L1210/cyclophosphamide, L1210/1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine, L1210/6-mercaptopurine greater than L1210/5-fluorouracil, L1210/Adriamycin greater than L1210/VCR. In [3H]harringtonine-preloaded cells, L1210/0 retained significantly more radioactivity than did L1210/VCR cells after repeated washing with fresh medium at 37 degrees. The radioactivity appeared to be predominantly bound to the microsomal fractions. [3H]Leucine incorporation into protein in L1210/0 cells was inhibited 90% within 15 min by harringtonine (0.5 micrograms/ml); incorporation of [3H]thymidine into DNA and [3H]cytidine into RNA was much less inhibited and showed an apparent lag of onset for 5 and 10 min, respectively. The relative potency of harringtonine to inhibit [3H]leucine incorporation in the above sublines in vitro follows an order similar to their rates of uptake of harringtonine by these sublines of cells. The efficacy of harringtonine, 2.4 or 3.6 mg/kg i.p., in increasing the life span of C57BL/6 X DBA/2 F1 mice bearing the sublines of leukemic cells, on the average, was: L1210/0 greater than L1210/cyclophosphamide, L1210/6-mercaptopurine greater than L1210/1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine, L1210/5-fluorouracil greater than L1210/Adriamycin, L1210/VCR. These results suggest that: (a) protein synthesis is the major initial target for the effect of harringtonine; (b) harringtonine bound more tightly to the cellular components of VCR-sensitive leukemic cells than to VCR-resistant cells; and (c) cellular uptake of harringtonine and the relative potency of inhibiting protein synthesis in sublines have a rank order similar to the chemotherapeutic efficacy of harringtonine in these cells.",,,,,

For the L1210 cells, a 5-hr pretreatment of 5 mM HU was optimum. The best result obtained with the HL-60 cells was after a 24-hr exposure of 1 mM HU. There was also a maximum incorporation of ara-C into DNA in both cells following these optimal pretreatment conditions. Cytofluorometric analysis demonstrated that this HU treatment resulted in a maximum accumulation of L1210 and HL-60 cells in the pre-S phase of the cell cycle and that after removal of the HU there was a rapid progression of the cell population through S phase. Because cytotoxicity of ara-C is considered to be predominantly from the inhibition of DNA polymerase and/or the incorporation into DNA, the cytokinetic and biochemical modulatory effects of HU must both be contributing factors to consider in achieving maximal cell kill from this drug sequence.",,,,,

This modification takes place after semiconservative replication. There is very little evidence, if any, that 5MeCyt could be naturally incorporated into mammalian DNA in semiconservative replication. We have clarified the possibility of incorporating 5MedCyd pharmacologically into human leukemic cells in vitro. To this end, we developed a novel small-scale synthesis method for 14C-labeled 5MedCyd starting from commercially available [14C]dThd derivatives. Particular attention was focused upon possible incorporation of radioactive 5MedCyd derivatives into the acid-soluble cellular fraction as well as into nucleic acids and protein in human cells. The results showed that [2(-14)C]- and [methyl-14C]5MedCyd were incorporated into human leukemic cells to a similar extent. The radioactivity originating from these compounds was incorporated mainly into the acid-soluble pool and nucleic acids. The exact nature of the intracellular radioactive molecules in RNA is not known, but the radioactive label in DNA hydrolyzate co-chromatographed exclusively with thymine. Hence, 5MedCyd is deaminated to thymidine before incorporating into DNA. This deamination had taken place already (partially) in the culture medium. Human leukemic cells do effectively protect their DNA from incorporation of exogenous 5MedCyd.",,,,,

Strains which transmit Emv-11 or Emv-14 or both were found to produce virus spontaneously, whereas strains that transmit Emv-13 alone were negative for virus expression. Restriction endonuclease digestion and hybridization with an ecotropic virus-specific hybridization probe of DNAs from strains which transmit only Emv-13 yielded enzyme cleavage patterns identical to those observed with DNAs from strains transmitting Emv-11 or Emv-14 or both. These findings indicate the absence of any gross rearrangement of Emv-13 proviral sequences. Cell cultures derived from recombinant inbred strains that carry only Emv-13 failed to express detectable infectious virus, viral proteins, or cytoplasmic ecotropic virus-specific RNA even after treatment with 5-iodo-2-deoxyuridine or 5-azacytidine, an inhibitor of DNA methylation.

Intracellular virions and their accumulation in IFN-treated cells could also be shown by radioactive labeling of the cells for 48 h and isolation of labeled virus particles from the cytoplasmic fraction of the cells by banding in sucrose gradient. These virions contained typical viral RNA, proteins and glycoproteins, as determined by gel-electrophoresis. Despite their higher accumulation, the formation rate of the intracellular virions, as measured by their pulse labeling for 1 h with S35-methionine, was found to be remarkably lower in IFN-treated cells. In order to elucidate this discrepancy, we followed the kinetics of the intracellular and extracellular virus appearance. We found that the inhibitory effect of IFN on the release of virus particles to the culture medium was much stronger than its effect on the formation of the intracellular virions. This finding can explain the accumulation of intracellular virus particles in IFN-treated cells despite their reduced formation rate.",,,,,

Slight granules containing iron can also be observed in parts of erythroblasts by means of the Berlin blue reaction. These cells are called sideroblasts. In chemical respect, non-haemoglobin iron consists of ferritin soluble in water and haemosiderin insoluble in water. Erythroblasts will only take their iron from plasma transferrin. For the most part, this iron uptake is being regulated by erythropoietin adapting erythropoiesis to the oxygen requirements of the tissue. The iron contained in erythroblasts is predominantly utilized for haemoglobin synthesis in these cells. A slight part is being taken up by ferritin. The bone-marrow reticulum will phagocytise aged erythrocytes and store liberated iron as ferritin and haemosiderin. Part of the iron is being delivered again to plasma transferrin. With constant serum iron level the liberation of iron from the reticulo-endothelial tissue must correspond to the iron uptake by erythropoiesis. The absence of iron capable of being coloured in the bone-marrow reticulum is considered to be a reliable parameter of iron deficiency. It enables the diagnosis of iron deficiency anaemia to be made even in those patients with serum iron level and a total iron binding capacity lying within the normal range and no hypochromia of erythrocytes being present. It enables iron deficiency anaemia to be separated from sideropenic anaemia with reticulo-endothelial siderosis in differential-diagnostic manner. Even in patients with sideroblastic anaemia, iron colouring of bone-marrow smears is required for ensuring the diagnosis. Recently, a separation has also been made for idiopathic anaemia with abnormal sideroblasts.

No such stimulation was observed with the exogenous reaction of this enzyme, using poly (rA) oligo (dT) as an exogenous template-primer. While the stimulatory capacity of extracts from uninfected and chronically infected cells was comparable, that of the exogenously infected cells was much more powerful in this respect. The stimulatory activity could be destroyed by trypsin, indicating that it was excerted by a protein. In uninfected and chronically infected cells this protein was found to be of a short functional life time under conditions blocking continuous protein synthesis. However the mRNA coding for this factor was found in these cells to be stable. On the other hand, the increased stimulatory activity, observed in extract of exogenously infected cells, was independent on protein synthesis and therefore was attributed to a protein apparently introduced into the cells by the penetrating virions. Experiments with monospecific antibodies against MLV proteins suggested that p30 is an important accessory for reverse transcriptase activity and that the cytoplasmic stimulatory factor might be also related to p 30.",,,,,

Its recognition is important because it carries the same high risk of disseminated intravascular coagulation as typical APL. An important clue to the correct diagnosis is the recognition of small numbers of characteristic cells containing multiple Auer rods. This report presents a case in which such Auer-body-containing cells were demonstrable in the marrow only after staining for chloroacetate esterase.

Each of eight tumors tested also lacked common leukocyte antigen (T200). In each of 13 cases studied, neither polyvalent surface immunoglobulin (sIg) nor receptors for sheep erythrocytes (E), complement (EAC), or the Fc portion of IgG immunoglobulin (EA) were found. Conversely, we found HLA-DR and/or T200 antigens, usually one or more receptors for E, EAC, or EA, and not infrequently, monoclonal sIg on malignant cells in each of 42 cases of lymphocytic lymphoma and leukemia.

The corresponding degree of inhibition in JLSV-11 cells was much lower. Multiplication of encephalomyocarditis virus in all three cell lines was barely affected by interferon treatment. Replication of vesicular stomatitis virus, on the other hand, was highly sensitive to interferon in the JLSV-11 line and in one NIH/MOL line but was practically insensitive in the other NIH/MOL line. Anticellular actions of interferon were more pronounced in the JLSV-11 line than in the others. In response to interferon treatment, 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase activity was induced to a high level in JLSV-11 cells and to lower levels in the NIH/MOL lines. We failed to detect any 2',5'-oligoadenylate-dependent endonuclease activity in extracts of these cells. Double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase activity was present in extracts of interferon-treated NIH/MOL cells, but it was barely detectable in extracts of interferon-treated JLSV-11 cells.

This inhibition was accompanied by a three- to twofold accumulation of intracellular virions. However, this accumulation could be demonstrated only be exogenous reverse transcriptase reaction assay or radioactive labeling of the assembled viral proteins. It could not be shown by the endogenous reverse transcriptase reaction assay, which depended on endogenous viral RNA, or by labeling the encapsidated viral RNA. It was therefore evident that most of the intracellular virions accumulated in interferon-treated cells were RNA deficient. Hybridization analysis revealed that these virions were deficient of genomic viral RNA, whereas size analysis by gel electrophoresis suggested that the deficiency of 4S RNA normally packaged in Moloney murine leukemia virus was even stronger. Our data also suggested that this RNA deficiency was not due to degradation of the encapsidated RNA, but more likely to a defect in virus assembly.

Immunoprecipitation studies show that both proteins share common antigenic determinants with each other and with the putative human keratins IEF 36 and 44, also present in HeLa cytoskeletons. Indirect immunofluorescence studies showed that both antibodies revealed similar filamentous networks in various cultured epithelial cells of human origin. These included AMA (transformed amnion), HeLa (cervical carcinoma), normal amnion cells, Fl-amnion (transformed amnion), WISH-amnion (transformed amnion), Chang liver (liver), and Detroid-98 (sternal marrow). Human cells that did not react with both antibodies included skin fibroblasts, lung fibroblasts (WI-38), SV40-transformed lung fibroblasts, Molt 4 (leukemia), lymphocytes, and monocytes. These results were in complete agreement with the presence or absence of both proteins in two-dimensional gels of the different cell types. Exposure of AMA cells to demecolcine (24 h; 10 micrograms/ml) caused the total collapse of vimentin filaments but, as seen by indirect immunofluorescence, caused only a partial redistribution of the IEF 31 and 46 filaments.

Spleen cells from chickens infected with REV-T (REV-A) or REV-A exhibited depressed mixed lymphocyte and mitogen responses in vitro. Allograft rejection was delayed by 6 to 14 days in birds infected with REV-A. The specific antitumor cell immune response was also studied by a 51Cr-release cytotoxicity assay. Lymphocytes from chickens infected with low numbers of the REV-T-transformed cells exhibited significant levels of cytolytic reactivity against the 51Cr-labeled REV-T tumor cells in vitro. The mitogen response of lymphocytes from these injected birds was similar to that of uninjected chickens. In contrast, lymphocytes from chickens injected with higher numbers of REV-T-transformed cells exhibited suppressed mitogen reactivity and failed to develop detectable levels of cytotoxic activity directed against the REV-T tumor cells. These results suggest that the general depression of cellular immune competence which occurs during REV-T (REV-A) infection could contribute to the development of this acute leukemia by inhibiting the proliferation of cytotoxic cells directed against the tumor cell antigens. The cytotoxic effect observed after the injection of chickens with non-immunosuppressive levels of REV-T-transformed cells appears to be specific for the REV-T tumor cell antigens since cells transformed by Marek's disease virus or avian erythroblastosis virus were not lysed. In marked contrast, birds whose cellular immune responses were suppressed by infection with REV-A were capable of producing a humoral immune response to viral antigens. Detectable levels of viral antibody, however, did not appear until 12 to 15 days after REV-A infection.

Two different sources of colony-stimulating factors were used in this study: human placental conditioned medium; and phytohemagglutin-stimulated leukocyte-conditioned medium. At the end of culture, colony types were determined by dual esterase staining in permanent preparations. The majority of the colonies formed in acute myeloblastic and acute promyelocytic leukemias were neutrophilic even when stimulated by phytohemagglutinin-stimulated leukocyte-conditioned medium, which contains a potent stimulator of macrophage colony growth from normal marrow cells. On the other hand, both neutrophilic and monocytic colonies were formed in acute myelomonocytic leukemia (AMMoL). The proportions of these two types of colonies were variable, depending on the nature of added colony-stimulating factor and its concentration. These findings suggest that the leukemic progenitors in acute myeloblastic and acute promyelocytic leukemias have a tendency to differentiate mainly into a neutrophilic lineage in vitro and that the leukemic progenitors in AMMoL differentiate into both neutrophilic and monocytic lineages in vitro, in two cases of esterase-negative AMMoL, both neutrophilic and monocytic colonies were detected as in the other well-defined cases of AMMoL.

Thus, it was concluded that the leukemia cells had a characteristic profile of the surface markers: ER+, Fc gamma-R+, HNK-1+, OKT3+, Leu-4+, OKT4-, OKT8-, Leu-3a, Leu-2a, and OKM1-. Although freshly isolated leukemic cells showed no cytotoxicity on NK targets, after incubation at 37 degrees C, the cells did show a potent cytotoxicity on targets of erythroleukemic cell, T cell, and monocyte (but not B cell) origins. When the cells were incubated at 37 degrees C, interferon (IFN gamma) was spontaneously produced in the culture fluids. Treatment with anti-HNK-1 and complement completely abrogated expression of NK activity and interferon production of the patient's lymphocytes in culture. These characteristic features of surface markers and functions strongly suggest the possibility that the leukemia cells of this case are of NK cell origin. The relationship between this case and chronic lymphocytic leukemia of T-cell origin is discussed.",,,,,

No difference was found between the extent of labeling of viral proteins and glycoproteins of intracellular virions. Incorporation of 3H-uridine into intracellular virions was strongly reduced by the IFN pretreatment. Since it is rather unlikely that encapsidated RNA is significantly degraded during the relatively short time of label incorporation, this finding suggests that IFN interferes with packaging of viral RNA.

Virus isolates were studied with respect to growth properties, XC-plaque formation, antigen profiles of their envelope proteins (gp70 and P15(E)), gp70 tryptic-peptide maps, and their potential to induce lymphomas after inoculation into newborn mice. B-tropic ecotropic MuLV with the capacity to cause plaques in XC cells was isolated from almost all lymphomas of both V+ and V- sublines. The reaction patterns of these ecotropic isolates with monoclonal antibodies reactive with MuLV-env proteins and the tryptic-peptide maps of the gp70 molecule indicate that they are similar to each other and differ only slightly from the ecotropic MuLV in the spleens of young V+ animals, which is identical to the milk-transmitted virus. XC-, B-tropic dualtropic mink cell focus-inducing (MCF) viruses were isolated from the majority of different types of lymphoma (B cell, T cell, or neither B nor T cell derived), but not from the spleens or milk of young V+ or V- animals. The env proteins of the MCF isolates are highly heterogeneous, but most isolates originating from B10.AV + T-cell lymphomas share MCF-related epitopes in their gp85 envelope precursor with AKR MCF-247 virus. Most MCF viruses isolated from non-T lymphomas do not possess these epitopes. The results indicate that also in this model the generation of dualtropic MCF viruses might be important in lymphoma induction, although only some of the cloned MCF viruses show enhanced oncogenic properties in comparison with ecotropic isolates. A cloned oncogenic MCF virus induced different lymphoma types in C57BL/10 (= B10, H-2b) and B10.A (H-2a) mice, similar to what was found earlier with the milk-transmitted virus. Hence, the lymphoma-type differences are not due to differences in the B-tropic ecotropic viruses transmitted through the milk in these strains, but reflect an influence of the H-2 complex on the phenotype of the virus-induced lymphomas.",,,,,

By injecting radiolabelled FLC, we showed that there was a greater loss of radioactivity from individual interferon-treated mice than from control mice. Thus, it was likely that fewer cells were recovered from the peritoneal cavity of interferon-treated mice because of cell destruction. Treatment of mice with interferon limited to the period preceding tumor-cell inoculation conferred some degree of antitumor activity, although this regimen was far less effective than when interferon treatment was initiated and continued daily after tumor-cell inoculation. We have been unable to transfer any antitumor activity with peritoneal washings containing macrophages and lymphocytes from interferon-treated donor mice to tumor-inoculated recipient mice. Inoculation of silica particles i.p., which destroys macrophage function and may affect NK cell activity, did not abrogate interferon's antitumor activity.

Competitive binding experiments using rat IgE from the IR 162 and IR2 immunocytomas and rat IgG indicated that both A2 and B5 were epsilon-chain specific and not anti-idiotype. A2 also exhibited some cross-reactivity with mouse IgE. When IgE was treated with chymotrypsin so as to produce both F(ab')2 and Fab fragments, the enzyme-treated IgE retained reactivity with B5, but the reactivity to A2 was lost. Heat denaturation of IgE at 56 degrees C resulted in a progressive loss of reactivity of the IgE for both A2 and the Fc receptor on rat basophilic leukemia cells; the reactivity of B5 remained unchanged. A2 does not evidently interact with the same site on the Fc of IgE that is involved in binding to the rat basophilic leukemia cell Fc receptor; A2 exerted little influence on the binding of IgE to rat basophilic leukemia cells. Thus, the data indicate that the antigenic site for B5 is in the Fab region of the IgE molecule and that A2 reacts with the IgE Fc.

The tumor was subjected to homogenization and subcellular fractionation on sucrose gradients; the immunogenic subcellular fractions underwent further separation by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The immunogenicity of the subcellular fractions and the SDS-PAGE-isolated molecular species were tested by (their) subcutaneous injection into syngeneic mice and examination of their splenocytes examined against tumor cell and normal cell targets by the chromium release cell-mediated lympholysis assay. Tumor cell homogenates were also separated by SDS-PAGE and tested for immunogenicity without prior fractionation. Splenocytes from mice that had received injections of certain SDS-PAGE-isolated epitopes derived from YBA tumor homogenate or its light and heavy subcellular fractions generated effective cytotoxic responses against YBA target cells after 6 days in vitro cultivation. In contrast, intact YBA tumor cells or non-separated tumor homogenates failed to induce an efficient cytotoxic response. The effector cells induced with the immunogenic SDS-PAGE-isolated epitopes of YBA tumor were specific, since they cytolysed the homologous target cells more efficiently than unrelated target cells or syngeneic normal cells. The activity of these effector cells was affected by varying the effector: target ratio. Augmentation of the cytotoxic responses was obtained when the splenocytes of mice immunized with SDS-PAGE-isolated epitopes of YBA tumor were restimulated in vitro, with the homologous neoplastic cells. Immunogenic SDS-PAGE epitopes were isolated from YAC tumor also (YAC is a Moloney-induced tumor of A mice). The effector cells induced with these separated epitopes were characterized as thymus-derived cells and not as natural killer cells. The results suggest that (1) the molecular repertoire of YBA and YBA tumors contain immunogens that can induce a specific antitumor cell-mediated response; (2) the isolated molecular species injected are more efficient immunogens than the entire, unseparated homogenate sample or a dose of 10(8) intact inactivated tumor cells; and (3) the gel matrix may be responsible for the enhanced cell-mediated response induced against the weakly immunogenic tumor.",,,,,

The low levels of leukemic target cell lysis in the conventional 51Cr-release assay contrasted with a pronounced inhibitory effect on the colony growth of the clonogeneic leukemic target cells (L-CFC). The ability of allogeneic lymphocytes to inhibit L-CFC increased if they were pretreated with interferon (IFN), which also increased their NK activity, monitored in parallel cytotoxicity assay, against K562. Furthermore, cell separation procedures, based on differences in density among nonadherent lymphocytes, revealed that only NK cell containing fractions were inhibitory. We have also compared the susceptibility to NK-mediated L-CFC inhibition of IFN pretreated leukemic target cells with that of nontreated target cells. As in the case of NK lysis in general, this pretreatment of target cells abolished the presumably NK-mediated L-CFC inhibition. In conclusion, these data provide the first indication that NK cells can inhibit the in vitro growth of fresh clonogenic leukemia cells from patients with nonlymphocytic leukemia. The identity of NK cells as effector is strongly suggested by Percoll separation and responsiveness to interferon; the final proof awaits more sophisticated purification of these cells.",,,,,

In studies on normal peripheral blood cells, monoclonal antibodies PMN 6 and PMN 29 have previously been shown to react exclusively with neutrophils while AML-2-23 reacts with both neutrophils and monocytes. The present report demonstrates that these antigens are absent from blast cells of patients with acute myelocytic leukemia (AML) classified as M1 and M2 in the French-American-British system and chronic myelocytic leukemia in myeloid blast crisis. However, leukemia cells with myelomonocytic morphology (M4) expressed all three antigens, while cells with pure monocytic features (M5) were generally only positive for AML-2-23. Based on the absence of these antigens on both leukemic and normal myeloblasts and granulocyte-monocyte progenitors and their characteristic patterns of display on more differentiated leukemic and normal cells, we propose a modified concept of normal myelopoiesis.

There was an apparently normal synthesis and processing of gag and pol gene products. The viral envelope precursor polyprotein gPr82env, however, did not yield the major envelope glycoprotein gp70. The gag precursor polyprotein, Pr65gag, as well as the gPr82env from RESA-2 cells were identified as AKR viral proteins by gel electrophoresis of hydroxylamine cleavage fragments. The virions formed by RESA-2 cells lacked gp70 and were noninfectious. After fusion of RESA-2 cells and mouse cells an infectious N-tropic virus was produced. The results indicate that rat 3Y1 cells lack (a) factor(s) necessary for the correct processing of gPr82env.

We report here that a common denominator in the activity of naturally occurring viremic cat antisera to FOCMA is, in fact, their reactivity to FeLV C antigenic determinants. The cat antisera, monoclonal antibodies to FOCMA, and monoclonal antibodies to FeLV C, all reacted in immunofluorescence assays with FeLV C-infected cells and immunoprecipitated a molecule electrophoretically indistinguishable from envelope glycoprotein of FeLV. Viremic cat antisera to FOCMA bound to budding virus particles of FeLV C-infected cells, even though some of them could not be absorbed by mature virion proteins. Thus, the unusual feature of cat antibodies to FOCMA is their binding to nascent but not to mature virus particles. FOCMA-positive cat lymphomas expressed antigenic determinants of FeLV-C gp70, with or without productive infection. FeLV-negative tumors not expressing FeLV C gp70 were also FOCMA negative. Furthermore, most of the viremic cat sera and the monoclonal antibodies to FOCMA did not react with FeSV-transformed nonproducer cells. The absence of FOCMA from these cells and from FeLV-negative lymphoid tumors and its presence in FeLV-C infected fibroblasts indicated that this antigen is virus encoded and not a cellular tumor-specific antigen.",,,,,

The results of these studies have varied; depending on the techniques and systems used, an increase, decrease, or no change in the degree of methylation has been reported. To our knowledge, however, primary human tumour tissues have not been used in such studies. We have now examined DNA methylation in human cancer with three considerations in mind: (1) the methylation pattern of specific genes, rather than total levels of methylation, was determined; (2) human cancers and adjacent analogous normal tissues, unconditioned by culture media, were analysed; and (3) the cancers were taken from patients who had received neither radiation nor chemotherapy. In four of five patients studied, representing two histological types of cancer, substantial hypomethylation was found in genes of cancer cells compared with their normal counterparts.

Our results indicate, first, that prostaglandin and histamine H2 receptors are present and functional at an early stage during myeloid differentiation; second, that there is no substantial difference between the pharmacological properties of the histamine H2 receptors in HL-60 cells and in mature human peripheral neutrophils; third, that the remarkable capacity for cyclic AMP formation noted in HL-60 leukemic cells after cell surface interaction by histamine or prostaglandin suggests that cyclic AMP and agents which increase its formation may have a role in the regulation of proliferation and/or differentiation of human myeloid progenitor cells.",,,,,

One recombinant (designated pCG14) isolated from this library contains a DNA sequence complementary to a small polyadenylated RNA that is abundant in RNA from CGL leucocytes. The relative concentrations of pCG14 RNA in the RNAs from a variety of normal and leukaemic leucocytes and human haemopoietic cell lines have been measured with a molecular hybridisation assay. This has shown that pCG14 RNA is 10 to 50 times more abundant in RNA from CGL leucocytes than in the RNAs from these other cells. The data indicate that the occurrence of pCG14 RNA in high abundance is sufficiently characteristic of a CGL leucocyte population to distinguish it from other populations of leucocytes. They suggest that the measurement of the concentrations of specific RNA species in leucocyte RNA by means of molecular hybridisation with cloned complementary DNAs may provide additional markers for the objective classification of human leukaemias which could be particularly useful since the method exploits a criterion different from any currently in use.,,,,,

In assays in which the reactivity of native and denatured p30 proteins was compared the detectability of sodium dodecyl sulphate-denatured MuLV p30 was better than that of native MuLV p30 suggesting that some of the most broadly cross-reactive sequences are localized inside the protein molecule and are freed by the denaturation process.

The amounts of type I and type II regulatory subunits (R I and R II) were established by a combination of the equilibrium binding of cyclic [3H]AMP and specific immunoprecipitation. In control cells the total specific cAMP-binding activity was 9.8 pmol/mg of cytosolic protein and the ratio of R II to R I was 1.2. After the induction of differentiation by growth in 2% dimethyl sulfoxide, the total cAMP-binding capacity doubled, but larger and opposing changes in R II and R I levels were observed. The concentration of R II tripled (to 16.6 pmol/mg) while R I content (1.5 pmol/mg) declined to one-third of the control cell level, resulting in an R II:R I value of 11.1. Treatment of Friend cells with 0.5 mM 8-bromoadenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (8-Br-cAMP) and 0.2 mM methylisobutyl xanthine for 2 days did not stimulate cell differentiation. however, the cAMP-binding capacity nearly doubled and the cells accumulated a high level of R II while R I declined. This resulted in a distribution of R subunits closely resembling that of differentiated cells. Cyclic AMP-stimulated histone kinase activity increased in proportion to cAMP-binding activity during differentiation; no such increase was seen following 8-Br-cAMP treatment. Fractionation of cytosolic extracts by DEAE-cellulose chromatography revealed that both R I and R II were fully associated with the catalytic subunit (C) of protein kinase before and after differentiation. In extracts of 8-Br-cAMP-treated cells all of R I and 40 to 60% of R II were not associated with C. Free R II isolated from these cells was indistinguishable from RII present in holoenzyme. Thus, erythroid differentiation of Friend cells results in a coordinate accumulation of R II and C subunits as well as a decline in R I content. In contrast, chronic exposure to 8-Br-cAMP elicits similar changes in R subunit levels but disrupts the coordinate regulation of R and C content.",,,,,

Various procedures designed to stain DNA versus RNA differentially with AO were tested, and the staining of isolated nuclei was compared with that of whole cells. Control incubations with RNase and DNase were performed to estimate in whole cells and in nuclei the contribution of DNA and RNA to the fluorescence intensity at the respective wavelength bands of maximum emission for DNA (F530) and RNA (F greater than 600). Depending on the cell type, 10-20% of total cell RNase-sensitive F greater than 600 is localized in the nuclei. The RNase-resistant portion of F greater than 600 of isolated nuclei represents the stainability of DNA. Suppression of cell proliferation in subconfluent cultures results in a decrease in both whole cell and in nuclear RNA content. Nonstimulated lymphocyte nuclei have considerably lower RNA content than nuclei from lymphocytes stimulated by pokeweed mitogen. Two subpopulations of nuclei having the same (2C) DNA content but differing in RNA content, are present in mouse liver; the cells entering S phase originate from the high RNA population.",,,,,

This analysis demonstrated clear homology between NCP150 and wild-type A-MuLV protein, but a number of phosphorylation differences were seen. Among them, two specific tyrosine phosphorylations present in all transformation-competent Abelson proteins were not observed in NCP150. No other phosphotyrosine-containing peptides were detected. In addition, transformation-defective mutants isolated from either the P120 or P160 wild-type strain lack phosphotyrosine-containing peptides. Double-infection studies with such transformation-defective and transformation-competent A-MuLV strains show that Abelson viral proteins may be substrates for their own tyrosine-specific kinase activity in vivo.

These transcripts were detected by electrophoresis of cytoplasmic polyadenylylated RNA through agarose-CH3HgOH gels followed by blothybridization using an IFN-alpha 1 (a prototype alpha S) cDNA probe and also by translation of the eluted RNA into biologically active IFN in the Xenopus oocyte assay. At least some of these long translationally active RNA molecules appear to represent functional mRNA species because they can be detected in polysomes. In addition, the oocyte translation assay has revealed the presence of unusually long (2-8 kb) IFN-beta mRNA species both in Sendai virus-induced Namalwa cells and in poly(I) . poly(C)-induced diploid human fibroblasts (FS-4). The detection of very long IFN-alpha 1-related mRNA species suggests that some of the DNA sequence features observed in the flanking homology units may affect the transcription of the IFN-alpha S genes. Our hybridization analyses also indicate that the 1.8-kb human IFN-alpha L mRNA(s) shows no detectable cross-hybridization with an IFN-alpha 1 cDNA probe.

The patient's peripheral lymphoblast count fell rapidly with ALL therapy, but the WBC count began to rise unexpectedly on the sixth day of treatment, with 84% myeloblasts and monocytoid blasts. Malignant cells in the bone marrow showed FAB-M4 morphology and were no longer reactive with antibodies directed against TdT or common ALL antigen. However, the myeloblasts continued to react with some of the same monoclonal antibodies as the original leukemia cells, and in addition expressed new determinants detected by monoclonal antibody TA-1 and peanut agglutinin.

HL-60 cells exposed to the antileukemic drug, 5-azacytidine (3 to 5 microM) for 24 hr and subsequently cultured in its absence for 2 to 3 days develop an enhanced ability to respond to 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate with increased respiratory burst activity detectable as an increase both in hexose monophosphate shunt activity and in the proportion of the population producing superoxide anion. 5-Azacytidine treatment also causes marked inhibition of DNA methyltransferase, and thus DNA synthesized by HL-60 cells during the 24-hr period of analogue treatment is essentially devoid of methylated cytosine residues. This suggests, as does our previous finding that a general inhibitor of transmethylation reactions, L-ethionine, can induce differentiation of HL-60 cells, that changes in gene expression triggered by these compounds may be linked to their ability to alter patterns of DNA methylation. Since at least 50% of HL-60 cells capable of forming colonies in soft agar after a 24-hr exposure to 5-azacytidine yield progeny that mature (i.e., produce superoxide anion in response to 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate) 2 weeks after 5-azacytidine treatment, the results also indicate that the changes induced in HL-60 cells by limited exposure to 5-azacytidine are heritable and can influence gene expression many generations after treatment has been terminated.",,,,,

Trypsin, however, digested both the nonfunctional and active immunoreactive forms of the enzyme. Isoelectric focusing of the cytosol separated two nonfunctional immunoreactive isoproteins, each having the same isoelectric points as the two active isoenzymes of dihydrofolate reductase (pls of 8.0 and 8.5). Studies in rapidly replicating and stationary-phase L1210 cells showed that the concentration of the nonfunctional immunoreactive protein increased rapidly, reaching a peak on Day 2 of log growth at which time active enzyme was at a nadir, and then decreased rapidly, reaching a nadir on Day 4, at which time active enzyme was at a peak.

Time course studies revealed that the growth of colonies and clusters was delayed in CMMoL as compared with that in normal control bone marrow. In 1 of 3 cases of CMMoL, the number of GM colonies increased after removal of phagocytes. Chloroacetate esterase and nonspecific esterase activities in the colonies and clusters were examined by means of our improved cytochemical technique. When we classified colonies and clusters into granulocytic, monocyte/macrophagic, myelomonocytic and mixed type, the incidence of ""myelomonocytic' colonies and clusters was significantly higher in two cases of CMMoL than in the normal controls. On the basis of these results, the characteristics of abnormal hemopoietic regulatory mechanisms were discussed.",,,,,

Paired samples of bone marrow (133) were taken simultaneously by aspiration and Jamshidi biopsy from 48 patients with acute leukemias and 67 patients with non-leukemic disorders. Cell kinetic analysis by (1) flow cytometry (FCM) of cellular DNA and RNA content, (2) autoradiography for [3H]TdR pulse labelling indices and (3) liquid scintillation counting of [3H]TdR uptake revealed significantly higher values in biopsies (p less than 0.001) exceeding the corresponding results from aspirates on average by factors of 1.65 for FCM S-phase index, 1.90 for G0/1 cells with high RNA content, 1.82 for [3H]TdR LI and 1.90 for [3H]TdR uptake. In more than 70% of all samples results from biopsies were 1.1-11.4 times higher, indicating that aspirates were equivalent to biopsies in fewer tan 30% of cases. Cell kinetic analysis in vitro blood/biopsy mixtures and measurements of DNA synthesis rate in corresponding aspirates and biopsies revealed that these discrepancies are due to the contamination of aspirates with non-proliferating nucleated blood cells. Biopsy, however, was found to provide representative and reproducible sampling of marrow for cell kinetic studies and should replace the presently used aspirate already characterized as ""unreliable marrow juice"" by Dameshek et al. in 1937 [18].",,,,,

The hypermethylated state of the endogenous AKR murine leukemia virus proviruses in these cells correlated with the failure to express AKR murine leukemia virus and the lack of infectivity of cellular DNA. Induction of the endogenous AKR murine leukemia virus proviruses with the methylation antagonist 5-azacytidine suggested a causal connection between DNA methylation and provirus expression. Also found to be relatively hypermethylated and noninfectious were three of six Moloney murine leukemia virus proviral DNAs in an unusual clone of infected rat cells. Recombinant DNA clones which derived from a methylated, noninfectious Moloney provirus of this cell line were found to be highly active upon transfection, suggesting that a potentially active proviral genome can be rendered inactive by cellular DNA methylation. In contrast, in vitro methylation with the bacterial methylases MHpaII and MHhaI only slightly reduced the infectivity of the biologically active cloned proviral DNA. Recombinant DNA clones which derived from a second Moloney provirus of this cell line were noninfectious. An in vitro recombination method was utilized in mapping studies to show that this lack of infectivity was governed by mechanisms other than methylation.",,,PMC256248,,

Using leukocytes from a patient with chronic myelogenous leukemia, in which the mononuclear fraction contained up to 75% basophils, both rat and mouse IgE were found to inhibit the binding of 125I-human IgE to the human basophilic leukemia (HBL cells). About 15-fold more rodent IgE was required for 50% inhibition of binding than unlabeled human IgE (hIgE). Dose-response studies using increasing amounts of rodent vs human 125I-IgE indicated that the HBL cells had about 8000 receptors per cell for hIgE and 5500 receptors per cell for rodent IgE. When the HBL cells were surface labeled with 125I and subsequently solubilized with non-ionic detergent, the labeled hIgE receptor could be isolated by either affinity chromatography on IgE-Sepharose (either human or rodent) or by immunoprecipitation with hIgE and anti-IgE. By SDS-PAGE on 10% gels, the receptor had a m.w. of 58,000 daltons. The solubilized receptors exhibited some rebinding to hIgE-Sepharose, and this rebinding could be inhibited by either human or rodent IgE but not by human IgG. Both the HBL cells and normal human basophils could be passively sensitized with murine IgE anti-DNP for antigen-induced histamine release. The minimum concentration of the mouse IgE antibody for sensitizing normal basophils was 20 to 200 ng/ml. Pretreatment of basophils with human IgE, but not human IgG, abrogated the capacity of the murine IgE antibody to sensitize the cells for histamine release, which indicated that the human and rodent IgE were interacting with the same receptor.",,,,,

Optimal lysis (100%), reached in 3-4 days, occurred when the concentration of the antibody in the culture medium was about 20 micrograms/ml containing an initial inoculum of 15,000 cells. A lower concentration (10 micrograms/15,000 cells/ml) led to partial cytolysis; the surviving cells, cultured in fresh medium, were still vulnerable to antibody lysis (30 micrograms/ml), thus indicating the lack of an apparent resistant cell population. The amount of free antibody in the culture medium diminished rapidly and very little or none was detectable after 2-3 hours of incubation with K-562 cells. The immune gamma-globulin also inhibited colony formation of K-562 cells in soft agar. The immune gamma-globulin, absorbed extensively with normal blood cells, to pluripotent K-562 cells, cross-reacted with several human malignant hematopoietic cell lines tested. These cells included T-lymphoblasts (JM and MOLT-4), promyelocytes (HL-60), Burkitt's lymphoma cells (RAJI), myeloblasts (KG-1 and KG-1a), and multiple myeloma cells (K-737). The absorption of the immune gamma-globulin with an equal number of cells from each of the cell lines assayed diminished but did not completely remove the antibody responsible for cytolysis of K-562 target cells. Thus, the K-562 leukemia blasts appear to possess common and specific antigens that may be only partially expressed on other committed leukemia cell lines studied. For this reason, the cytolytic activity of the immune gamma-globulin could only be removed by absorption with K-562 cells possessing a complete array of antigens solely present on pluripotential hematopoietic cells.",,,,,

Tumor cells exposed to murine leukemia virus 4070A in vitro expressed virus antigens, released both reverse transcriptase and infectious virus into supernatant fluids, and grew and regressed after injection into syngeneic animals. In contrast, uninfected tumor cells did not express virus antigens and grew progressively. Rejection of virus-infected tumor cells appeared to be a host-mediated event, since murine leukemia virus 4070A infection had no detectable cytopathic effect on fibrosarcoma cells. Rejection of virus-infected tumor cells occurred in guinea pigs unable to suppress the growth of the line 10 hepatoma at sites of injection of mycobacterial cell walls and unable to develop immunity to the line 10 hepatoma. Guinea pigs immunized with virus-infected tumor cells were unable to reject a challenge of uninfected tumor cells. The results are interpreted to mean that infection of guinea pig tumors in vitro by a murine leukemia virus led to synthesis of viral antigens by the tumor cells which in turn led to recognition of the tumor as foreign with consequent tumor destruction; tumor eradication occurred without development of immunity to cryptic, intrinsic tumor antigens.",,,,,

The bone marrow was markedly hypocellular in three patients, including one in whom the marrow morphologic results were essential for diagnosis. Embedding the marrow biopsy specimen in plastic and staining the sections for TRAP was noted to be a useful technique in establishing the diagnosis of hairy cell leukemia. In all cases in which this was performed, the authors found abundant TRAP-positive cells in the marrow biopsy specimen; even in those cases with markedly hypocellular marrows, this technique revealed the presence of hairy cells. In one patient, TRAP staining of the marrow biopsy specimen proved essential for definitive diagnosis.

Such maps revealed light (27 kDa) and heavy (33 kDa) DR chains as well as a non-dissociated 60 kDa DR complex.

Maps from eleven patients showed decreased levels of 33 and 60 kDa antigen components, while eleven further patients expressed only DR light chains. Two patients lacked detectable DR antigens. Sequential mapping of individual patients indicated that expression of 33 and 60 kDa DR components fluctuates over months.

The marked heterogeneity observed when testing human lymphoid leukemias with these MCAs could be explained by both polymorphism and heterogeneity in lymphocyte differentiation marker expression. An awareness of the preferential murine immune response to polymorphic determinants on human lymphoid leukemia cells is essential when interpreting unexpected positive or negative results when testing with MCAs. An MCA believed to be detecting a monomorphic determinant may be detecting a high-frequency (supratypic) polymorphic determinant, and a putative leukemia-specific MCA may be detecting a low-frequency polymorphic determinant.

Despite vast effort aimed at demonstrations of such antigens, their existence in the generality of cancer remains unproved. Serological analysis of 3 tumor types, mouse leukemia and sarcoma and human malignant melanoma, has received the most attention, and a rudimentary classification of the surface antigens expressed by these tumors has begun to emerge. The prime candidates for antigens that can be considered tumor specific are the few instances of Class 1 antigens that have now been serologically defined on mouse and human tumors. These antigens show an absolute restriction to individual tumors and are not demonstrable on any other normal or malignant cell type. Biochemical and genetic characterizations of Class 1 antigens represent an essential next step in an evaluation of the significance of these antigens. The surprising features of the thymus leukemia (TL) antigens of the mouse provide insight into the genetic origin of another key class of tumor antigens, i.e., those with characteristic properties of both differentiation and tumor-specific antigens. In normal mice, TL antigens are restricted to cells in the thymus, and strains differ with regard to expression versus nonexpression of TL antigens. Genetic information for TL is universal in mice, however, as leukemias that develop in mice normally lacking TL are found to express TL. What is clear from the past two decades of research in cancer immunology is that a far more detailed knowledge of surface antigens of tumor cells will be necessary before we can begin to assess the possibility of immunological control of cancer.",,103,,,

Cell killing was determined using a sensitive, rapid and accurate assay which employed very low numbers of cells and very small quantities of interferon. The cytolytic activity of IFN gamma on 11 murine tumor cell lines was investigated. A 20-fold difference was found between the most-sensitive cell type, P-388 lymphoma, versus the most resistant cell type, C127v leukemia. A number of normal mouse cells was also found to have low to intermediate sensitivity to the cytolytic action of IFN gamma. Human IFN gamma was also shown to have cytolytic activity which, like mouse IFN gamma, was relatively species-specific. Direct cytolysis was not found to be a characteristic of IFN-alpha/beta. Different mechanisms of action for the antiviral and cytolytic activities of IFN gamma are indicated because the cytolytic titer of IFN gamma did not parallel its antiviral titer on most cell types and increasing the cell number produced a decrease in the cytolytic titer and an increase in the anti-viral titer. High concentrations of IFN gamma (i.e., 2,900 units/ml) resulted in complete lysis of cells within 24 h, while lower concentrations (i.e., 700 units/ml) resulted in a reversible inhibition of cell growth during this time period. Evidence that the cytolytic substance in the IFN gamma preparation was IFN gamma include the following: (1) both antiviral and anticellular activities copurified through a 30-fold purification; and both activities were (2) relatively species-specific; (3) sensitive to heat; (4) inactivated by low pH and (5) neutralized by antibodies to IFN gamma. Therefore, we propose the possibility that direct cytolysis is yet another of IFN gamma's distinctive antivities.",,,,,

In the majority of bone marrow cells from the normal controls and many of the patients, the number of cells with detectable AgNORs, and the staining intensities in those cells which were Ag+, were markedly reduced compared with the levels found in blood lymphocytes. The numbers of cells having satellite associations and the numbers of chromosomes participating in these associations also generally reflected the proportions of AgNORs present. When patterns of bone marrow silver staining were compared between patients with leukemia, distinct differences were found which could be correlated with cytology. It is suggested that different cell types have characteristic AgNOR staining profiles, reflecting specific regulation of ribosomal RNA synthesis in particular cell lineages.

In contrast, only one B-lymphoma line out of 18 genuine lymphoma, myeloma, and leukaemia cell lines tested spontaneously produced small amounts of interferon. Following treatment with 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd), interferon was produced without further induction in most B-lymphoid cell lines, but not in any of the non-B, non-T, T-lymphoid or myeloid lines examined. Modulation of spontaneous interferon production by chemicals (sodium butyrate, dexamethasone, dimethylsulfoxide, a phorbol ester, and BrdUrd) was studied in more detail in three B-lymphoblastoid and four B-lymphoma cell lines. The patterns of responses observed were different for the action of different chemicals on a given cell line as well as between lymphoblastoid and lymphoma lines in general; furthermore, several lines of evidence suggest that chemicals can differentially influence spontaneous and virus-induced interferon production in an given cell line. The composition of spontaneously produced interferon was analysed using antisera specific for HuIFN-alpha and HuIFN-beta. Interferons produced by untreated as well as BrdUrd-treated lymphoblastoid cells contained more than 95 per cent IFN-alpha, whereas BrdUrd-treated lymphoma cells produced IFN-alpha as well as minor amounts (cell lines Namalwa and NC-37) or even over 90 per cent of IFN-beta (Daudi).",,,,,

(2) We have taken advantage of these metabolic phenomena, demonstrating in this paper that the uptake of 18F-5-fluorouridine, a positron-emitting radiopharmaceutical, can provide a very practical means for measuring changes in proliferative states of tissues in vivo. (3) Two major changes in proliferative states have been examined: one involves changes in growth of normal mouse tissues induced by pharmacological agents; the other involves tumor growth and neoplastic infiltration in mice and rabbits. (4) We describe tracer experiments with 18F-5-fluorouridylate, prepared by enzymatic means, and with 18F-5-fluorouridine, prepared by both enzymatic means and direct radiochemical procedures. (5) Uptakes of 18F after a pulse of 18F-5-fluorouridine were increased in mouse spleen following phenylhydrazine treatment to induce increased splenic erythropoiesis. (6) Uptakes of 18F in various mouse tissues were decreased following pretreatment with actinomycin D. This finding is consistent with the known inhibitory action of actinomycin on RNA synthesis. (7) Intracerebral Zimmerman ependymoblastoma tumors showed extraordinarily high uptakes of fluorine-18 in mice injected intravenously with 18F-5-fluorouridylate or with 18F-5-fluorouridine in contrast to very low uptakes by normal brain tissue. (8) After intracerebral injection of mice with suspensions of L1210 leukemia cells, distant organs such as lung, liver, and spleen became involved. These tissues showed significant increases of radioactivity after pulse labeling with 18F-5-fluorouridylate consistent with histological evidence for infiltration of these tissues by neoplastic cells. (9) Intramuscular VX2 carcinoma tumors in rabbits showed localized uptakes of 18F significantly higher than surrounding normal muscle tissue. (10) The most important clinical implication of the present work is the promise that 18F-5-fluorouridine uptakes can be followed in humans by positron emission tomography. This would provide a direct means of measuring different rates of in vivo proliferation in neoplasms, hematologic tissues and other organs undergoing rapid growth changes.",,,,,

The internal BamHI fragments of a DNA clone of Moloney leukemia virus (MLV) were replaced with a purified BamHI DNA segment containing the tk gene. Chimeric genomes were created carrying the tk insert in both orientations relative to the MLV sequence. Each was transfected into TK- cells along with MLV helper virus, and TK+ colonies were obtained by selection in the presence of hypoxanthine, aminopterin, and thymidine (HAT). Virus collected from TK+-transformed, MLV producer cells passed the TK+ phenotype to TK- cells. Nonproducer cells were isolated, and TK+ transducing virus was subsequently rescued from them. The chimeric virus showed single-hit kinetics in infections. Virion and cellular RNA and cellular DNA from infected cells were all shown to contain sequences which hybridized to both MLV- and tk-specific probes. The sizes of these sequences were consistent with those predicted for the chimeric virus. In all respects studied, the chimeric MLV-tk virus behaved like known replication-defective retroviruses. These experiments suggest great general applicability of retroviruses as eucaryotic vectors.",,,PMC369806,,

The cellular enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used for the testing of our anti-Ia and anti-HLA MCA with 15 other CCC lines.

Numerous studies in animals and man suggest effectiveness of IFN and IFN inducer therapy in cancer. However, the competency of the various components of the endogenous IFN system in malignancy has received little attention. These studies show that in malignancy there may be (1) a high incidence of elevated blood levels of IFN; (2) a deficient response of peripheral blood mononuclear cells to endogenous and exogenous IFN; and (3) increased uninduced in vitro IFN production by these cells. These findings indicate that cancer patients are equipped with the ability to produce IFN and suggest that it may be the deficient response of their cells to IFN that plays a role in the development and progression of the disease. Furthermore, the finding of increased spontaneous ""uninduced"" production of IFN by cells from cancer patients suggest the possibility of an intracellular inducer such as found in persistently virus-infected cells.",,,,,

The characterization of intracellular and extracellular viral specific proteins and polyproteins immunologically with various antisera, and structurally by tryptic digest mapping experiments, indicated that the antiretroviral action of IFN was not due to an IFN-induced alteration in the synthesis of any viral protein. Steady state labeling experiments, however, showed that the processing of three viral specific precursor polyproteins, namely gPr90env, Pr40gag, and Pr25gag, were perceptively slowed in IFN-treated cells. This effect was apparently not related to the ability of these proteins to be modified by phosphorylation or glycosylation after translation since these processes occurred normally in the IFN-treated cells. The treatment of cells with IFN also caused the accumulation of a small amount of a fucosylated viral glycoprotein precursor, termed gP93env, in virus. With the exception of this minor protein, virus released from IFN-treated cells were normal in their content of viral proteins. These virus particles were only slightly less infectious, particle for particle, than virus released from control cultures. Based on these results, we suggest that IFN causes an as yet unelucidated alteration in cell membrane structure of function, or both, which prevents either the insertion of viral core precursor molecules into membrane or the recruitment or clustering of such viral polyproteins into virus assembly centers in the membrane.

In this study, we investigated the possibility that gamma (gamma) interferon production, induced by phytohemagglutinin (PHA) might be impaired in leukocytes from patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL). We also compared this response with alpha (alpha) interferon production, and with PHA-stimulated lymphocyte transformation. We have shown that the gamma interferon response of leukocytes from patients, both in relapse and in remission, was markedly lower than in leukocytes from normal donors. However, the alpha interferon response in leukocytes from the patients was normal. In contrast the defective gamma interferon response to PHA stimulation of cells from patients in remission, lymphocyte transformation by PHA was normal. Lymphocytes from patients in relapse has a delayed response. Our findings suggest (1) that the defective gamma interferon response which occurs in cells from patients with ALL, both in relapse and remission, contributes to increased susceptibility to viral infections, (2) that alpha interferon may not be the optimal type of interferon for treatment of certain viral infections, and (3) that different triggering mechanisms, or different receptors, exist for PHA-induced gamma interferon production and for lymphocyte transformation in cells of patients with ALL.",,,,,

Treatment of L 1210 R cells with beta-interferon does not result in the induction of any detectable enhanced pppA (2'p5'A)n synthetase and protein kinase activities whereas gamma-interferon is capable of inducing both of these enzymes.

In paraffin sections from a rapidly progressive case of PML, hyperimmune JC virus antiserum stained single oligodendroglia which were located in white matter that appeared normal histologically and stained normally with MAG and MBP antisera. In zones surrounding areas of demyelination, virus containing oligodendroglia were most numerous and MAG staining of periaxonal regions was decreased, but there was little change in MBP staining. In demyelinated regions, both MAG and MBP staining were severely altered; also there was much less JC virus staining. In tissue from three other chronic cases, viral antiserum stained fewer oligodendrocytes and the differences in MAG and MBP staining were much less striking. In epon sections from two biopsies of central nervous system tissue, we studied the electron microscopic appearance of oligodendroglia that also had been stained by JC virus antiserum.

No MuMTV particles were produced by the ML cells, although they did contain type A particles--the pronucleocapsids of MuMTV. The ML antigen appeared to be an aberrant form of the intracellular MuMTV env precursor molecular prgp70, which was not processed properly but instead acquired extra carbohydrate groups and was expressed in uncleaved form on the cell surface. Isolation of MuMTV core protein p28 from the leukemic cells and subsequent tryptic peptide mapping analysis showed that the p28 from leukemia cells differed from the p28 of MuMTV isolated from DBA/2 mouse milk. These observations indicate that the MuMTV expressed in DBA/2 leukemic spleen cells is of a different strain than the virus secreted in lactating mammary glands of DBA/2 mice and probably represents the expression of an endogenous DBA/2 provirus.",,,PMC256914,,

The degree of chemiluminescence was dependent on the concentration of NK-enriched lymphocytes or target cells, and plasma membrane vesicles from K562 also induced a chemiluminescence response. Mild glutaraldehyde treatment of effector cells abrogated their ability to generate chemiluminescence, whereas K562 target cells treated in the same way were almost fully able to induce a chemiluminescence response to NK-enriched lymphocytes. These results show a directionality of response with NK as the responders and tumor cells as the stimulators. A survey of eight different tumor cell lines and fetal fibroblast lines revealed a striking correlation (r greater than 0.93, P less than 0.001) between the ability of a given line to bind to NK-enriched lymphocytes, induce chemiluminescence, and to be lysed. Three differentiated sublines of K562 grown in butyrate and cloned induced little chemiluminescence compared with the K562 parent, and they were selectively resistant to NK-mediated binding and cytolysis. In addition, treatment of K562 cells with higher concentrations of glutaraldehyde for longer periods led to varying degrees of target antigen preservation, as measured in cold target competition assays and in conjugate formation. The degree of NK target antigen preservation correlated directly with the ability of the cells to induce chemiluminescence (r greater than 0.95). The degree of NK activation was also important because interferon-pretreated effectors generated more chemiluminescence upon stimulation with K562 or MeWo targets. Monocytes or granulocytes did not contribute to the chemiluminescence induced by NK-sensitive targets. Some NK-resistant tumor cell lines were sensitive to monocyte-mediated cytolysis and also induced chemiluminescence in monocytes but not NK cells. These results show that the target structures recognized by the NK cell may play a role in NK activation because the degree of chemiluminescence was directly proportional to the ability of a given target cell line to bind to the NK cell and to be lysed.",,,PMC2186753,,

This prompted a review of secondary leukemias in children following chemotherapy/radiotherapy for another primary malignancy. These patients responded poorly to treatment of the secondary leukemia with a median survival of about four months. The incidence of secondary leukemias might be expected to be on the rise as increasing numbers of pediatric cancer patients are surviving longer after treatment with agents that are potentially leukemogenic or carcinogenic themselves.

Elevation of PRPP pool size following administration of L-[alpha S,5S]-alpha-amino-3-chloro-4,5-dihydro-5-isopazoleacetic acid (NSC-163501) (AT-125) was maximal at 8 hr and returned to pretreatment levels by 24 hr.

Moreover, such augmentation in PRPP pool size preferentially affected P388 tumor rather than the small intestine. Following i.p. administration of LD10 doses of AT-125, DON and azaserine, the specific activities of PRPP anabolizing and catabolizing enzymes were determined. A significant inhibition of PRPP amidotransferase was demonstrated with DON and AT-125 (P less than 0.05), and no inhibition with azaserine. A similar modulation of PRPP pool size demonstrated in vivo following administration of 250 mg/kg of ART-125 in mice bearing colonic adenocarcinoma lines. It was suggested that a significant increase of PRPP pool size might cause the possible synergism of a selected L-glutamine antagonist and 5-fluorouracil as reported after the appropriately scheduled administration of methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil.",,,,,

This purified TNF has a molecular weight of 140,000, is glycoprotein in nature, and migrates on free electrophoresis as an alpha 2-globulin. TNF activity was continuously monitored during purification by bioassay in vitro (tumor cell lysis) and was confirmed by demonstration of induction of tumor necrosis in vivo. A single target tumor cell line, murine myelomonocytic leukemia (WEHI/3), was used in both assays. In the in vivo assay, controls were heat-inactivated samples of TNF. As additional controls, a line of TNF-resistant WEHI/3 cells was used in the in vitro assay. Results from in vivo radiolabeling of TNF-sensitive and TNF-resistant cells indicated a difference between their cytoplasmic peptide profiles. Optimal TNF production was not altered in C. parvum-endotoxin-treated mice by treatment with silica, a substance that is specifically toxic for macrophages. Exposure of mice to 650 rad whole-body radiation, which is not markedly damaging to macrophage elements in the reticuloendothelial system, completely abrogated the ability of the mice to produce TNF after C. parvum-endotoxin treatment.

In the first part of this study we demonstrated that UR2, the most recently isolated avian sarcoma virus, contains in its genome a unique sequence, ros, nonhomologous to src, fps, and yes sequences or to transforming genes of avian acute leukemia viruses. Using cDNAs specific to the inserts of avian sarcoma virus genomes, we examined the existence and the transcription of cellular nucleotide sequences related to the three new onc genes of avian sarcoma virus (fps, yes and ros) in various cells. The progenitor cellular sequences for these onc genes (c-onc) were present in uninfected chicken DNA in one or few copies per haploid genome. These c-onc sequences were detectable in cellular DNA of a wide variety of vertebrates, and the homology between viral and cellular onc was inversely related to the phylogenetic distance of animal species. The pattern of expression of these c-onc genes in different tissues of chickens was found to be unique to each gene. The expression of c-fps and c-ros genes was generally repressed in many tissues, but c-fps was expressed at higher levels in bone marrow (2.5 copies per cell) and lung (1.1 copies per cell), whereas c-ros was mainly transcribed in kidney (2.5 copies per cell). On the other hand, c-yes transcripts were easily detectable in all tissues analyzed and were found at high levels in kidney (26 copies per cell). These c-onc expressions were unaffected by infection with avian sarcoma viruses that contained other onc genes. In a few cultures of chicken and quail transformed cells derived from tumors induced by chemical carcinogens, we found that the levels of transcription of the four c-onc genes remained unaltered, compared with that in normal tissues.",,,PMC256055,,

Our aim was to investigate, using an absorption method, the HLA antigens of ten leukaemic cells and to compare these results with those of normal lymphocytes. The following sera was used for absorption: anti-B5 serum, anti-B7 serum, anti-B12 serum. These sera were absorbed on the ten leukaemic cells and fifteen healthy lymphocytes. An anti-A1 + B8 serum and an anti-A2 serum were absorbed on the ten leukaemic cells, but there was not enough serum to carry out the similar absorption with the healty lymphocytes. Two points emerged from these results. (1) Leukaemia cells absorbed anti-HLA antibodies as effectively as healthy lymphocytes when the cells carried the antigen corresponding to the serum specificity. The curves obtained with leukaemia cells were comparable to those of healthy cells. (2) When the cells were not carriers of the antigens corresponding to the antibody's specificity, leukaemia cells were also capable of absorbing antibodies, unlike healthy lymphocytes which had no or poor absorption.",,,,,

Significantly higher ganglioside concentrations are required to prevent completely the antiviral effect.

The effect of human leucocyte interferon (IFN-alpha) on the NK activity was also estimated. Spontaneous NK activity was stronger in the adult patients with trisomy-21 than in the healthy controls, but the difference did not reach statistical significance. The augmentation of NK activity by IFN-alpha, measured using lymphocytes not depleted of monocytes as effector cells, was statistically significant in both the trisomic patients (P less than 0.004) and the healthy controls (P less than 0.0005). Using monocyte and macrophage depleted lymphocytes in the patients with trisomy-21 the NK activity proved stronger than in the healthy controls, but not significantly and IFN-alpha did not augment it as it did in the healthy controls (P = n.s., P less than 0.05), for augmentations respectively). These results support the view that monocytes and macrophages are connected with the NK cell system. ADCC correlated with NK activity in both groups. Since NK cells are important components of many immune processes, including tumour and virus and/or bacteria-infected cell elimination, and have regulatory functions in immune reactions, the deficient augmentation of trisomic NK cells shown in vitro with extrinsic human leucocyte interferon may, paradoxically be an explanation for the greater susceptibility of trisomic individuals to lymphatic leukaemia and virus and bacterial infections. In vivo, this could be explained by the more potent secondary suppression by the 'immune' interferon produced by the virus, bacteria and malignant cells. In other words, the potential of the 'fighting couple' of the immune system, NK cell/interferon, is perhaps disturbed genetically due to the chromosome 21.",,,PMC1536446,,

The three native molecules were recognized by anti-type antibodies, but only the gp71 and the 32,000-dalton molecule seemed to retain group-specific antigenic determinants. No interspecies determinants were detected on the two products of digestion. A similar pattern of precipitation was found with SDS-denatured antigens. The results suggest that sequential structures contribute to the type-specific antigenic determinants, because they were not destroyed by SDS unfolding or by the change in the protein conformation that follows enzymatic cleavage. Interspecies determinants seem to be mainly conformational, since they disappeared from the whole molecule and the two peptides after the same treatment. Group-specific determinants appear to be intermediate: they disappeared after the conformational change on the native 43K but not on the 32K peptide and the monospecific anti-group antibody showed an intermediate ability to precipitate the SDS-unfolded antigens.",,,,,

ABVD combined with radiotherapy in 153 patients with stage IIB, IIIA, or IIIB disease was superior to MOPP plus radiotherapy in the CR induction (94% vs 79%, P less than 0.01), particularly in the presence of nodular sclerosis histology (P less than 0.03) and B symptoms (P = 0.01), as well as in the relapse-free survival of patients with pathologic stage IIIA disease (ABVD, 100%; MOPP, 68%; P = 0.02). Total survival was similar between the two treatment groups, but, compared to MOPP, ABVD chemotherapy was associated with a lower incidence of delayed toxic effects such as azoospermia, prolonged amenorrhea, and cancerigenesis. ABVD induced CR in 59% of 54 patients resistant to MOPP; 37.5% of the complete responders remain alive and disease-free at 5 years. The cyclic delivery of MOPP and ABVD was significantly superior to that of MOPP alone in terms of CR (92% vs 71%; P = 0.02), freedom from disease progression (70% vs 37%; P less than 0.0001), and relapse-free survival (77% vs 47%; P less than 0.01) at 5 years. Toxic effects were similar between the two treatment groups, but there was a higher incidence of vomiting and alopecia following ABVD chemotherapy; in the group given MOPP alone, one patient who had previously failed extensive irradiation developed acute nonlymphocytic leukemia. ABVD is confirmed to be an effective regimen that is non-cross-resistant to MOPP and devoid of late morbidity. Therefore, its administration, when alternated monthly with MOPP, offers the possibility to improve the cure rate of Hodgkin's disease.",,,,,

Within the group of patients with advanced disease, age greater than 40 years and/or stage IV disease with multiple extranodal sites of involvement adversely affected prognosis. Since 1978, these patients have been treated with MOPP-ABVD and irradiation, with a resulting 3-year survival of 87% compared with 58% for those treated with MVVPP in prior years. A comparison between MVVPP and MOPP, also begun in 1978, has thus far yielded no significant differences. Second malignancies have occurred in four patients apparently cured of their Hodgkin's disease: two patients with acute leukemia and two with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

The efficacy of chemotherapy alone as compared with combined modality therapy in patients with poor-prognostic stages I and II is evaluated in CALGB 7751. Currently, both therapies produce very high complete remission rates in asymptomatic patients; the remission rate is better with combined modality therapy in symptomatic patients. Single and combined modality therapies are compared for stage III patients in CALGB 7451. Complete remission rates have been similar, but relapse-free survival is superior for patients treated with local nodal radiotherapy followed by chemotherapy (P = 0.04). In particular, stage IIIA patients with nodular sclerosis seem to benefit from the inclusion of radiotherapy in their initial treatment. In CALGB 7551, the efficacy of chemotherapy alone versus chemotherapy plus radiotherapy to areas of bulky disease is under study in patients with stages IIIB and IV. Currently, a relapse rate of less than 10% has been seen among sites irradiated, and survival is best for patients treated with radiotherapy bracketed by chemotherapy. Finally, the role of two alternating non-cross-resistant combination chemotherapy programs is being studied in CALGB 7552. Relapse-free and overall survival is better with the doxorubicin-containing regimen than with either the alternating or alternate chemotherapy program. At present, the median followup for each of these studies is less than 5 years. Further observation is required to answer the critical questions relating to prolonged disease-free survival and cure.",,,,,

To elucidate the mechanism(s) responsible, we compared the effects of arazide and araA 5'-triphosphates on DNA polymerases alpha and beta of L1210 leukemia cells. Both nucleoside triphosphate analogs inhibited DNA polymerase alpha activity by competing with dATP; only araATP was inhibitory to DNA polymerase beta. Arazide triphosphate was at least four times more active than araATP as an inhibitor of DNA polymerase alpha.

Cell cycle analysis was performed throughout the course of induced cellular maturation. Within 24 h of exposure to CM, cells with macrophage-like morphology were identified among the developing adherent cells. Approximately 15-30% of the cells in culture suspensions also developed macrophage-like morphology and esterase reactivity with alpha-napthyl acetate after incubation for 2 d. The number of these nonproliferating cells increased and became predominant in the later culture period. Flow cytometric measurement of DNA content showed that these mature cells had the same aneuploid stemline as the undifferentiated leukemic cells, indicating that genetically abnormal leukemic cells can be induced to differentiate. Reduction in the total RNA content of the macrophage-like cells was also determined by flow cytometry. Reduction in RNA and development of adherent cells served as early markers of maturation, in addition to the later acquisition of complement receptors and phagocytic capacity. Cell cycle analysis showed that CM stimulated the proliferation of immature cells. This initial proliferation may precede intertwined events of proliferation and concurrent maturation of immature cells.

In three courses of treatment using increasing doses, the active 5'-triphosphate of ara-A, 9-beta-D-arabinofuranosyladenine 5'-triphosphate (ara-ATP) accumulated in leukemic cells and erythrocytes from a patient treated for acute lymphocytic leukemia in proportion to the dose of ara-A. The cellular ara-ATP concentration increased more than 5-fold after the injection of a single, nontoxic, but pharmacologically active dose of 2'-deoxycoformycin 24 hr after initiation of ara-A infusion. However, this response was associated with a concomitant increase in the cellular deoxyadenosine triphosphate concentrations to levels equal to or greater than those of ara-ATP throughout the three treatment courses studied. Consistent with previous results using cell-free systems, it was demonstrated that a competitive relationship exists between deoxyadenosine triphosphate and ara-ATP for the inhibition of DNA synthesis in cultured human lymphoblastoid cells and that the ratio of the cellular concentrations of these nucleotides could predict the extent of inhibition of DNA synthesis. Application of this rationale to the nucleotides in the leukemic cells of the patient suggested that administration of 2'-deoxycoformycin may create a cellular biochemical milieu that could be antagonistic to the inhibition of DNA synthesis by ara-ATP.",,,,,

Both of these drugs are commonly used for the treatment of women with breast cancer; thus, sequencing of methotrexate before 5-fluorouracil was evaluated in vitro using a human mammary carcinoma cell line, 47-DN. Intracellular 5-fluorouracil accumulation was maximally increased 4-fold in cultures pretreated with 10 microM methotrexate for 24 hr. This enhancement of 5-fluorouracil metabolism was associated with increased intracellular levels of 5-phosphoribosyl 1-pyrophosphate, resulting from the antipurine effect of methotrexate. Brief exposure to exogenous hypoxanthine at physiological concentrations reversed the biochemical synergism between methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil. Other antimetabolites associated with elevations of 5-phosphoribosyl 1-pyrophosphate enhanced intracellular accumulation of 5-fluorouracil up to 2.5-fold. In cloning assays, 18 hr of methotrexate pretreatment followed by 5-fluorouracil resulted in optimal synergistic cytotoxicity, which could be prevented if high concentrations of leucovorin were given between methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil administration. Since these results indicated that optimal breast tumor toxicity in vitro was achieved by 18- to 24-hr sequencing of methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil, clinical toxicity study was carried out to assess whether this drug schedule could be tolerated. Seven patients with advanced cancer were treated with 21 courses of sequential therapy. No toxicity occurred with 38% of treatment courses; mild to moderate leukopenia and mucositis occurred with 29 and 38% of courses respectively. Toxicity was related to treatment interval and not cumulative drug dose or elevated serum methotrexate levels. These clinical results suggest that Phase II studies evaluating 24-hr-sequenced methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil in breast cancer are warranted.",,,,,

It was found that in both PHA-stimulated and leukemic lymphocytes the complexity of total poly(A)+RNA is strongly reduced in respect to normal unstimulated lymphocytes. The differences is due to a small portion, by weight, of high complexity sequences, suggesting the involvement or nuclear, not necessarily transcriptional, events. Moreover the heterologous hybridizations show that: 1) in PHA-stimulated lymphocytes there is a set of highly abundant sequences which are represented in normal and leukemic lymphocytes at a very reduced rate; 2) the sequences abundant in normal unstimulated lymphocytes are less represented in leukemic lymphocytes; the converse also is true, but at a lower extent.

Plus DNA400 and plus DNA300 were detected by molecular hybridization with DNA probes complementary to sequences from both the 3'- and 5'-ends of the viral RNA. Both species appear to be copied from the 5'-end of minus strand DNA by their hybridization properties and their early synthesis when only the 5'-end of minus strand DNA is available as template. Restriction endonuclease mapping of plus DNA400 and plus DNA300 rules out a precursor-product relationship between the two. Rather the results suggest a unique initiation site for both species, with plus DNA400 containing internal sequences not present in plus DNA300. Plus DNA400 and plus DNA300 appear to be analogous to early plus DNA species detected in cells early after retrovirus infection.

Treatment of mice carrying advance leukemia (day 6 following inoculation with 10(6) cells i.p.) with 6-azauridine (AzUR) results in prolonged survival (2-3 days) and also in increased expression of PA activity by the ascitic cell population. Similar treatment with pyrazofurin (PF), another inhibitor of orotidylate decarboxylase and of de novo pyrimidine synthesis, fails to produce either of these effects. Neither AzUR or PF, given at the early stage of tumor growth (day 3), extend the life span nor do they cause increase of the PA activity. Thus, the elevation in PA activity following treatment with AzUR is associated with the asymptotic stage of the disease and this phenomenon correlates positively with the life-prolonging effects of this drug. An analysis of the PA activity elicited by intact cells, secretions, and cellular digests suggests that most of the activity originates on the surface of the cells. The results indicate that the described in vivo effect of AzUR, but not that of PF, on late-stage leukemia, is mediated by the changes in the fibrinolytic potential of the tumor or host cells rather than through the inhibition of the de novo pyrimidine synthesis.",,,,,

Various categories of CTL clones were identified, ranging from CTL clones tht were tightly H-2 restricted and specific for the immunizing tumor to CTL clones that displayed no discernible patterns of specificity and that attacked a large number of different target cells. In addition, the surface markers of these cloned CTL were defined, and the best conditions for their prolonged maintenance in culture were determined.

Treatment of human bone marrow cells with monoclonal-anti-Ia-like (Ia) plus complement inhibited colony and cluster formation by approximately 50% but did not affect pre-CFU-GM. Reduction of colonies and clusters was similar whether bone marrow cells were exposed to anti-Ia plus complement, high specific activity tritiated thymidine ((3)HTdr) or acidic isoferritins.

Anti-Ia, without complement, did not reduce colony or cluster formation but did block the inhibitory action of acidic isoferritins. A relationship existed between Ia antigens and the activity of acidic isoferritins in the following ways: (a) The apparent loss of Ia-antigens from CFU-GM by 5 h in culture at 37 degrees C, but not at 27 degrees or 4 degrees C, was associated with nonresponsiveness to inhibition with acidic isoferritins, (b) Ia-antigen(-), noncycling pre-CFU-GM that were insensitive to acidic isoferritins could generate a population of Ia-antigen(+) cycling CFU-GM in vitro that were responsive to inhibition by acidic isoferritins, and (c) nondetectability of Ia-antigens on CFU-GM from patients with leukemia was associated with nonresponsiveness to inhibition by acidic isoferritins. These results implicate Ia-antigen(+) progenitor cells in the regulation of myelopoiesis in vitro and demonstrate that absence of Ia-antigens on patient CFU-GM is associated with imbalances in normal regulatory interactions in vitro.

This report describes its biological and biochemical effects of L1210 leukemia cells. CC-1065 is one of the most cytotoxic agents known. The concentrations required for a 50 and 90% inhibition of cell growth are 0.02 and 0.05 ng/ml, respectively. It is about 400 times more cytotoxic than was Adriamycin. The action of CC-1065 is rapid and is dose and time dependent. CC-1065 inhibits DNA synthesis much more than it inhibits RNA and protein synthesis. The concentrations required for a 50% inhibition of DNA synthesis and RNA synthesis are 4 to 6 and 45 to 60 ng/ml, respectively. Although the drug inhibition of DNA synthesis cannot completely account for its cytotoxic effects on L1210 cells, these results, along with those generated by other investigators, suggest that the inhibition of DNA synthesis represents a major mode of action of CC-1065. CC-1065 inhibited both thymidine kinase and DNA polymerase alpha activities, but the effect on highly purified DNA polymerase alpha was more pronounced. At 1 microgram/ml, CC-1065 inhibited more than 70% of the enzyme activity. In order to elucidate the mechanism of inhibition of DNA polymerase alpha, the interaction between CC-1065 and DNA was investigated. The studies with thermal melting of DNA and difference circular dichroism measurement indicate that CC-1065 is one of the strongest DNA-binding agents. It induced an increase in thermal melting temperature of calf thymus DNA by at least 31 degrees. The circular dichroism studies also reveal that CC-1065 binds only to double-stranded DNA but not to heat-denatured DNA or yeast RNA. These observations were supported by those obtained with two other experimental approaches. CC-1065 also appeared to interact with proteins, but the interaction was weak and reversible.",,,,,

By 20 s intracellular adenine is near steady-state; beyond this the rate of accumulation of intracellular 3H reflects nucleotide synthesis, predominantly the rate of ATP accumulation within the cell as determined by liquid chromatography. Adenine incorporation into the nucleotides proceeds via adenine-phosphoribosyl transferase, which is rate-limiting to AMP formation and subsequently the formation of ADP and ATP. Acceleration of this pathway by the addition of glucose and phosphate decreases the intracellular adenine level far below equilibrium as metabolism is increased relative to transport. Assessment of methodology to evaluate intracellular adenine and its metabolites indicates that (i) a 4 degree C wash removes the major portion of intracellular adenine and (ii) at 4 degree C, transport of adenine remains rapid and while nucleotide synthesis is decreased, ATP still accumulates within the cell. Hence, measurement of cellular uptake of radioactive label at 4 degree C after cells are washed free of adenine cannot be used as a measurement of adenine surface binding since this radioactive label represents, at least in part, phosphorylated derivatives of adenine within the cell. Unlabeled adenine and structurally related compounds were found to inhibit [3H]adenine net uptake under conditions where metabolism of adenine was reduced, suggesting that base transport is mediated by a facilitated diffusion mechanism. This is consistent with other studies from this laboratory that demonstrate exchange diffusion between adenine and other bases.",,,,,

Because the intracytoplasmic granules of LGL appear to be peculiar to the subpopulation of mononuclear cells containing NK effectors, we have investigated their possible requirement in the cytolytic process. Experiments reported here show that Sr++, a cation known to cause degranulation of granulocytes, caused a dose- and time-dependent inhibition of the NK activity of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. A single-cell NK assay showed that the number of cytotoxic cells was not significantly reduced, but that Sr++ inhibited NK by preventing individual effector cells from engaging in multiple lethal hits. Moreover, the inhibition of NK appeared to be reversible; culture in vitro of Sr++-treated PBMC resulted in the eventual return of cytolytic activity in these cells. Augmentation of NK by interferon (IFN) was similarly blocked by Sr++. In addition, Sr++ also inhibited the NK activity of IFN-prestimulated effector cells and, as before, NK function returned during subsequent culture. These results indicated that the return of NK function after Sr++ treatment was the result of reactivation of cytotoxic cells rather than recruitment of new effectors. We have shown in other studies that Sr++ degranulates LGL, and the data presented here provide support for the hypothesis that the intracytoplasmic granules of LGL are required for NK-mediated cytotoxicity.",,,,,

Since this DNA is at least partially methylated in vivo and serves as an excellent substrate for methylation in vitro, hypomethylation of DNA in analog-treated cells appears to result from the loss of DNA methyltransferase, rather than from an inherent inability of 5-azacytosine- substituted DNA to serve as a methyl acceptor. Inhibition of DNA synthesis blocks the loss of DNA methyltransferase activity while inhibitors of RNA synthesis do not, suggesting that the analogs must be incorporated into DNA to mediate their effect on the enzyme, and that minor substitution of 5-azacytosine for cytosine in DNA (approximately 0.3%) suffices to inactivate more than 95% of the enzyme in the cell. Several lines of evidence link changes in the pattern of DNA modification with differentiation. In this regard, it is significant that 5-azacytidine and 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine act as weak inducers of erythroid differentiation of Friend erythroleukemia cells in the same concentration range where they affect DNA methyltransferase activity. For differentiation to proceed, the cells must be washed free of the drugs.

After IgE activation there is increased phospholipid methylation, Ca2+ influx, arachidonic acid, and histamine release. On Ca2+ ionophore A23187 stimulation, phospholipid methylation is not increased, but Ca2+ influx, arachidonic acid, and histamine release occur. Variants of the RBL-cloned sublines defective at different stages in the release process were obtained and used to sequence the different events in the release process: IgE activation is followed by methylation, Ca2+ influx, arachidonic acid, and histamine release. However, there are other variants with defects in intermediate steps in the pathway, e.g., increased phospholipid methylation that is not followed by Ca2+ influx or arachidonic acid release not followed by histamine release. Isolating variants carrying drug-resistance markers made hybridization (reconstitution) experiments possible. Two variants were recognized, each of which was deficient in one of the two phospholipid methyltransferase enzymes. Neither of these two variants released histamine; hybrids formed by fusion of these two cell lines have both phospholipid methyltransferase enzymes and release histamine. By other complementation experiments, groups of variants with defects at different steps in the histamine release sequence were recognized. Clearly, these basophilic leukemia cell lines provide a unique system for the study of the mechanism of histamine release.",,,,,

This ratio can be estimated for the G1A, G1B, S, and G2 + M cell cycle compartments. Changes in growth rate or the addition of antitumor drugs induces characteristic changes in the ratio either evenly throughout or at a particular phase of the cell cycle. Under such conditions, measurement of cellular DNA and RNA content provides a sensitive assay of any deviation from balanced cell growth.

Forty-eight hours after MTX dosage the level of 7-hydroxymethotrexate exceeded that of MTX by ten to one. Studies of the utilization of thymidine and inosine by MTX-treated L1210 cells in culture suggest that these cells may be able to utilize these substrates when their extracellular concentration is less than 1 microM. The incorporation of 14C hypoxanthine into the nucleotide pools and the nucleic acids of L1210 cells increases following exposure to MTX. This observation is compatible with the known increased availability of phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate in these cells following MTX treatment.

The formation of ternary complexes of thymidylate synthetase has been examined as a basis for the interaction of FUra and MTX in L1210 cells. L1210 cells converted 39% of the total intracellular MTX into MTX-poly-gamma-glutamates within 4 hours of a 1 microM MTX exposure. MTX-diglutamate (2,4-diamino,N 10-methylpteroyl-diglutamate) and MTX-triglutamate were the predominant metabolites. In contrast to the ternary complexes formed with MTX and MTX-diglutamate, the 5-fluorodeoxy-uridylate (FdUMP)-7,8-dihydropteroylpentaglutamate-enzyme and the FdUMP-5,10-methylenetetrahydropteroylpentaglutamate-enzyme complexes were stable to polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under nondenaturing conditions.

We propose that the sequence-dependent effect of MTX plus FUra on L1210 cell viability results from MTX and MTX polyglutamate inhibition of dihydrofolate reductase, and consequently a trapping of intracellular folates as dihydrofolate polyglutamates that could increase the extent of FdUMP binding to thymidylate synthetase.",,,,,

We show here that dexamethasone has a dual mode of action on the HMBA-induced differentiation of a Friend cell line, DS19. At concentrations above 10(-10) M, dexamethasone inhibits the HMBA-induced differentiation in DS19 cells. We further found that as the concentration of HMBA is reduced, the amount of dexamethasone required to inhibit differentiation increases. Such inhibition seems to act primarily by decreasing the probability that a cell will become committed to differentiate. Besides, dexamethasone does not inhibit hemoglobin synthesis of cells which are committed in its absence. In addition, we show that sensitivity to the inhibition by dexamethasone is inversely related to the inducibility of cell populations. The second action of dexamethasone, observed at concentrations between 10(-10) and 10(-13) M, is to increase the proportion of hemoglobin-containing cells relative to that for cells cultured in its absence. The degree of this synergistic effect for induced differentiation is inversely related to the level of induction in the absence of dexamethasone and thus is best observed in the cells cultured at low levels of HMBA. We present evidence that this synergistic effect may be due to an increased viability of the induced cells and possibly an increase in the proliferative capacity of these cells.",,,,,

Consistent reduction of normal colony formation to approximately 50% of baseline levels was observed using a monoclonal anti-human la antibody in a complement-dependent cytotoxicity assay titrated over serial dilutions. ELimination of the la-antigen-bearing CFU-GM population was associated with virtually a complete loss of responsiveness to the inhibitory effects of prostaglandin E. Maintenance of bone marrow cells in short-term suspension culture at 37 degrees C prior to agar culture resulted in the loss of detectable la-antigen on the CFU-GM and, similarly, loss of response to prostaglandin. In contrast, most patients with chronic myeloid leukemia showed greatly reduced levels of la-antigens on their CFU-GM in fresh marrow together with lack of prostaglandin sensitivity, suggesting a correlation with the abnormal growth regulation observed in these patients. In two chronic myeloid leukemia patients, levels of la-antigen higher than that observed in the majority of patients could be detected and correlated with a residual response to prostaglandin E. These results suggest a relationship in normals between the expression of la-antigens on CFU-GM and the physiologic response to regulation by prostaglandin E, and a possible mechanism for the aberrant regulatory response in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia.",,,,,

By labeling these virions with either [35S]methionine or [3H]glucosamine, we demonstrated that they contain the same viral proteins and glycoproteins found in extracellular virions. Interferon treatment was found to reduce the rate of intracellular virus assembly. This effect was not a consequence of an interferon inhibition of viral RNA synthesis or its translation or a consequence of an interference with the posttranslational cleavage processing of viral precursor proteins, since all of these steps were not affected by interferon. However, the reduced rate of virus assembly could be attributed to the inhibition of viral protein glycosylation observed in interferon-treated cells. Nevertheless, despite this reduced rate, virus particles accumulated in interferon-treated cells. This accumulation was probably due to the strong inhibition of their final release from such cells.",,,PMC256694,,

Under the conditions used, viral RNA synthesis was inhibited, but viral protein synthesis continued, and the cells produced noninfectious particles (actinomycin D virions) lacking genomic RNA (J. G. Levin and M. J. Rosenak, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 73:1154-1158, 1976). Analysis of total RNA in virions revealed that the amount of hybridizable viral RNA decreased steadily after the addition of actinomycin D and by 8 h was 10% of the control value. Studies on fractionated viral RNA showed that this low level of hybridization is due to residual 70S RNA in the virion population. The results indicated that viral RNA which is destined to be encapsidated into virions has a half-life of approximately 3 to 4 h. In contrast, other intracellular virus-specific RNA molecules appeared to be quite stable and persisted for a long period of time, with a half-life of at least 12 h. These observations support the idea that two independent functional pools of 35S viral RNA exist within the infected cell: one serving as message and the other as precursor to virion RNA. The existence of two viral RNA pools was further documented by the finding that 12 h after the addition of actinomycin D, when virion precursor RNA was depleted, 35S and 21S viral nRNA species could be identified in polyribosomal RNA as well as in total polyadenylated cell RNA. Surprisingly, 35S and mRNA declined more rapidly than did 21S mRNA, which appeared to be increased in amount.",,,PMC256680,,

Steady-state-labeled P120 was distributed equally in the two fractions (lymphoid cells) or mostly in the soluble portion (fibroblasts). Thus, there was an apparent movement of P120 from the detergent-insoluble matrix to the detergent-soluble fraction and a concomitant loss of enzymatic activity. When the detergent-insoluble matrix was incubated with [32P]ATP in situ, phosphorylation of tyrosine residues of P120 was observed. We found an 80,000-molecular-weight fragment of P120 (designated F80) after extraction of fibroblast cells with detergent. F80 was not found in extracted lymphoid cells, but mixing labeled lymphoid cells and unlabeled fibroblasts before extraction produced the fragment. F80 contained the gag determinants of P120 but did not react with Abelson-specific serum.

Profiles for CDA mediated lysis of the leukemia target lines were determined for sera from 149 FeLV exposed cats, and animals were identified whose sera would selectively lyse almost any possible combination of tumors from one to five lines tested. Cross absorption and cold target inhibition studies were performed on selected sera, and a spectrum of different antigens was identified which included both individual determinants and antigens shared by some of the tumor lines. Leukemias FL74 and F422 carried a cross-reactive determinant which was distinct from a second antigen shared by 3272 and 3281; lines F422, 3272 and 3281 each also carried a unique antigen. Leukemia 79-14940 did not cross-react with other target tumor lines.

Measurement of the inhibition of 3HTdr incorporation during 2 h incubation with cytostatic; 2. Evaluation of the cell viability in short-term (5 days) liquid culture. The 37% decrease in living cells count or in the rate of 3HTdr incorporation has been evaluated as indicating sensitivity to examined drugs. Out of many determinations performed by these use of 2 mentioned methods, those executed simultaneously were compared. Comparable results were obtained to arabinoside-cytosine testing, showing ca. 94% of sensitive cases.In relation to vincristine the 3HTdr incorporation method showed more often - in 82% of cases - sensitivity as compared to only 46% tested in culture method, whereas to daunorubicine more common effect on cultured cells viability (86%) than on tritiated thymidine incorporation (40%) could be observed. These differences remain to be elucidated as to their technical or biological sources. The sensitivity to L-asparaginase was shown only in about the half of cases by both methodes.",,,,,
