As currently most CML cases are treated with Imatinib, variant rearrangements have in general no specific prognostic significance, though the emergence of therapy resistance remains to be studied. RESULTS: Here we report an exceptional CML case with complex chromosomal aberrations not observed before, involving a 5 chromosome translocation implying chromosomal regions such as 1q42, 4p14 and 5q31 besides 9q34 and 22q11.2. CONCLUSION: The reported rearrangement developed most probably in one initial step and had no influence on a good response during Imatinib treatment.","['Al Achkar, Walid', 'Wafa, Abdulsamad', 'Mkrtchyan, Hasmik', 'Moassass, Faten', 'Liehr, Thomas']","['Al Achkar W', 'Wafa A', 'Mkrtchyan H', 'Moassass F', 'Liehr T']","['Molecular Biology and Biotechnology Department, Human Genetics Div,, Atomic Energy Commission of Syria, P,O, Box 6091, Damascus, Syria. scientific@aec.org.sy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20091109,England,Mol Cytogenet,Molecular cytogenetics,101317942,PMC2777175,2009/11/11 06:00,2009/11/11 06:01,['2009/11/11 06:00'],"['2009/09/14 00:00 [received]', '2009/11/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/11/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/11/11 06:01 [medline]']","['1755-8166-2-21 [pii]', '10.1186/1755-8166-2-21 [doi]']",epublish,Mol Cytogenet. 2009 Nov 9;2:21. doi: 10.1186/1755-8166-2-21.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU), T lymphocytes, particularly CD4(+) T lymphocytes, play a central role in its immunopathogenic mechanisms. In humans, activated CD4(+) T cells also play a central role in the immunopathogenic mechanisms. This notion is demonstrated in two human diseases: one is Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease, and the other is human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) uveitis. Activated CD4(+) T cells infiltrating the eye are harmful to vision-related cells and tissues in the eye and cause sight-threatening conditions. However, the eye has regional defence systems to protect itself from these harmful activated T cells. We focus on ocular pigment epithelium (PE) and demonstrate immunoregulatory activity of iris PE and retinal PE. Iris PE suppresses activated CD4(+) T cells by cell-to-cell contact with a crucial role played by B7-2 molecule on iris PE and CTLA4 on T cells. The actual immunosuppressive factor being membrane bound TGF-beta. In contrast, retinal PE suppresses activated CD4(+) T cells by soluble factors, such as soluble TGF-beta and thrombospondin 1. In addition to the direct T-cell suppression by ocular PE, ocular PE has the capacity to promote activated T cells to regulatory T cells and use them as a tool to amplify the immune down regulation in the eye. The molecular mechanisms of generation of T regulatory cells by iris PE and retinal PE is also discussed.","['Mochizuki, Manabu']",['Mochizuki M'],"['Department of Ophthalmology & Visual Science, Tokyo Medical and Dental University Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Yushima, Bunkyoku, Japan. m.manabu.oph@tmd.ac.jp <m.manabu.oph@tmd.ac.jp>']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20091107,England,Acta Ophthalmol,Acta ophthalmologica,101468102,,2009/11/11 06:00,2010/08/07 06:00,['2009/11/11 06:00'],"['2009/11/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/07 06:00 [medline]']","['AOS1757 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1755-3768.2009.01757.x [doi]']",ppublish,Acta Ophthalmol. 2010 May;88(3):292-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1755-3768.2009.01757.x.

Inactivation of cancer cell apoptosis by somatic mutations has been reported in several cancers. Caspase-10 activation is important in the initiation phase of apoptosis. The aim of this study was to explore whether CASP10 gene that encodes caspase-10 is somatically mutated in acute adulthood leukaemias and multiple myelomas (MMs). METHODS: We analysed the entire coding region and all splice sites of CASP10 gene for the detection of somatic mutations in 60 acute leukaemias (25 acute myelogenous leukaemias, 35 acute lymphoblastic leukaemias) and 22 multiple myelomas by a single-strand conformation polymorphism assay. RESULTS: Overall, we found two CASP10 mutations in the cancers (2/82; 2.4%). One mutation [c.854T>C (pLeu285Pro)] was detected in a T-acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL) (1/13 T-ALL; 7.7%). The other mutation [c.61C>T (p.Arg21Cys)] was found in an MM (1/22 MM; 4.5%). The mutations were identified in the coding regions of the death effector domain (p.Arg21Cys) and the p17 large protease subunit (pLeu285Pro). We observed both of the T-ALL and the MM with the CASP10 mutations well expressed the mutant CAS10 at mRNA level. CONCLUSION: Although our data indicate that somatic mutation of CASP10 is not common in T-ALL and MM, the data suggest a possibility that CASP10 mutation might contribute to the pathogenesis of factions of T-ALL and MM.","['Kim, Min Sung', 'Oh, Ji Eun', 'Min, Chang Ki', 'Lee, Seok', 'Chung, Nak Gyun', 'Yoo, Nam Jin', 'Lee, Sug Hyung']","['Kim MS', 'Oh JE', 'Min CK', 'Lee S', 'Chung NG', 'Yoo NJ', 'Lee SH']","['Department of Pathology, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Pathology,Pathology,0175411,,2009/11/11 06:00,2010/01/23 06:00,['2009/11/11 06:00'],"['2009/11/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/23 06:00 [medline]']","['S0031-3025(16)31980-8 [pii]', '10.1080/00313020903041143 [doi]']",ppublish,Pathology. 2009;41(5):484-7. doi: 10.1080/00313020903041143.,5,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'Caspase 10/*genetics', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/*genetics', 'Mutation', 'Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Young Adult']",,"['EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 10)', 'EC 3.4.22.63 (CASP10 protein, human)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, the subsequent clinical outcome was overviewed in 292 patients with leukemia/myelodysplastic syndrome who received allo-HCT. Among them, 93 (32%) showed relapse/progression. Cohort 1 was chosen to receive no interventions with curative intent (n = 25). Cohort 2 received reinduction chemotherapy and/or donor lymphocyte infusion (n = 48), and Cohort 3 underwent a second allo-HCT (n = 20). Sixty-three patients received reinduction chemotherapy, and 27 (43%) achieved subsequent complete remission (CR). The incidence of nonrelapse mortality (NRM) was similar among the three cohorts (4, 15, and 5%). The 1-year overall survival (OS) after relapse was significantly better in patients with a second HCT (58%) than in others (14%, Cohorts 1 and 2; P <.001). However, the 2-year OS did not differ between the two groups, which suggests that it is difficult to maintain CR after the second HCT. Multivariate analysis showed that reinduction chemotherapy, CR after intervention, second HCT, and longer time to post-transplant relapse were associated with improved survival. In conclusion, for patients with relapse after allo-HCT, successful reinduction chemotherapy and a second HCT may be effective for prolonging survival without excessive NRM. However, effective measures to prevent disease progression after a second HCT clearly need to be developed.","['Kurosawa, Saiko', 'Fukuda, Takahiro', 'Tajima, Kinuko', 'Saito, Bungo', 'Fuji, Shigeo', 'Yokoyama, Hiroki', 'Kim, Sung-Won', 'Mori, Shin-Ichiro', 'Tanosaki, Ryuji', 'Heike, Yuji', 'Takaue, Yoichi']","['Kurosawa S', 'Fukuda T', 'Tajima K', 'Saito B', 'Fuji S', 'Yokoyama H', 'Kim SW', 'Mori S', 'Tanosaki R', 'Heike Y', 'Takaue Y']","['Department of Stem Cell Transplantation, National Cancer Center Hospital, Chuo-ku, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,,2009/11/10 06:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/11/10 06:00'],"['2009/11/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ajh.21555 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2009 Dec;84(12):815-20. doi: 10.1002/ajh.21555.,12,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Cohort Studies', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/mortality/*surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/drug therapy/mortality/*surgery', 'Recurrence', 'Reoperation', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Salvage Therapy', 'Survival Rate', 'Transplantation, Homologous/statistics & numerical data', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",,,"['(c) 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 1986 and 2003, 92 children (median age, 11 years; range, 3-16 years) underwent TBI before allogeneic SCT. 43 of them had a minimum follow-up of 12 months (median, 51 months; range, 12-186 months) and were included into this analysis. Conditioning regimen included chemotherapy and fractionated TBI with 12 Gy (n = 26) or 11.1 Gy (n = 17). In one patient, renal dose was limited to 10 Gy by customized renal shielding due to known nephropathy prior to SCT. Renal dysfunction was defined as an increase of serum creatinine > 1.25 times the upper limit of age-dependent normal. RESULTS: Twelve children (28%) experienced an episode of renal dysfunction after a median of 2 months (range, 1-10 months) following SCT. In all but one patient renal dysfunction was transient and resolved after a median of 8 months (range, 3-16 months). One single patient developed persistent renal dysfunction with onset at 10 months after SCT. None of these patients required dialysis.

However, the mechanisms behind these effects remain elusive. We investigated toxic effects of different selenium concentrations in human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells by evaluating Ca(2+) mobilization, cell viability and caspase-3 and -9 activities at different sample times. We found the toxic concentration and toxic time of H(2)O(2) as 100 microM: and 10 h on cell viability in the cells using four different concentrations of H(2)O(2) (1 microM: -1 mM: ) and six different incubation times (30 min, 1, 2, 5, 10, 24 h). Then, we found the therapeutic concentration of selenium to be 200 nM: by cells incubated in eight different concentrations of selenium (10 nM: -1 mM: ) for 1 h. We measured Ca(2+) release, cell viability and caspase-3 and -9 activities in cells incubated with high and low selenium concentrations at 30 min and 1, 2, 5, 10 and 24 h. Selenium (200 nM: ) elicited mild endoplasmic reticulum stress and mediated cell survival by modulating Ca(2+) release, the caspases and cell apoptosis, whereas selenium concentrations as high as 1 mM: induced severe endoplasmic reticulum stress and caused cell death by activating modulating Ca(2+) release, the caspases and cell apoptosis. In conclusion, these results explained the molecular mechanisms of the chemoprotective effect of different concentrations of selenium on oxidative stress-induced apoptosis.","['Uguz, Abdulhadi Cihangir', 'Naziroglu, Mustafa', 'Espino, Javier', 'Bejarano, Ignacio', 'Gonzalez, David', 'Rodriguez, Ana Beatriz', 'Pariente, Jose Antonio']","['Uguz AC', 'Naziroglu M', 'Espino J', 'Bejarano I', 'Gonzalez D', 'Rodriguez AB', 'Pariente JA']","['Department of Physiology, University of Extremadura, Badajoz, Spain.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20091107,United States,J Membr Biol,The Journal of membrane biology,0211301,,2009/11/10 06:00,2010/03/24 06:00,['2009/11/10 06:00'],"['2009/08/18 00:00 [received]', '2009/10/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/11/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00232-009-9212-2 [doi]'],ppublish,J Membr Biol. 2009 Dec;232(1-3):15-23. doi: 10.1007/s00232-009-9212-2.

Conversion of drug resistance reversal studies to drug resistance prevention studies may assist in the development of more efficient anti-tumor strategies. The present study demonstrates the prevention of doxorubicin-induced drug resistance by tetrandrine on leukemia cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: K562 cells were either solely treated with doxorubicin (0.6 mg/ml) or pretreated with tetrandrine of different concentrations (0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 microg/ml) for 24 h followed by combined-treatment with doxorubicin (0.6 microg/ml). RESULTS: The results showed that doxorubicin treatment only resulted in elevated levels of mdr1 mRNA/P-gp expression. Doxorubicin also induced up-regulation of P-gp functional activities, as intracellular retention of rhodamine was decreased; however, 2.0 microg/ml tetrandrine significantly inhibited the overexpression of doxorubicin-induced mdr1 mRNA/P-gp. Consistently, the functional activity of P-gp was also inhibited, which led to increased intracellular drug retention and the recovery of cell sensitivity to chemotherapeutic drugs in combined treatment groups. Both mRNA and protein levels of NF-kappaB were up-regulated in the cells treated with doxorubicin only. Results from an electrophoretic mobility shift assay and a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay demonstrated the enhanced binding to the promoter region of mdr1 gene compared to the control group. However, tetrandrine could markedly inhibit the doxorubicin-induced expression of NF-kappaB mRNA and protein. In addition, it also attenuated the NF-kappaB DNA-binding activity. CONCLUSION: In summary, tetrandrine can prevent doxorubicin-induced mdr1 mRNA/P-gp expression and P-gp functions in a dose-dependent manner through a mechanism that may involve inhibition of doxorubicin-induced NF-kappaB mRNA expression and protein activity.","['Shen, Huiling', 'Xu, Wenlin', 'Chen, Qiaoyun', 'Wu, Zhaoyang', 'Tang, Huarong', 'Wang, Fachun']","['Shen H', 'Xu W', 'Chen Q', 'Wu Z', 'Tang H', 'Wang F']","[""The Affiliated People's Hospital, Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20091107,Germany,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol,Journal of cancer research and clinical oncology,7902060,,2009/11/10 06:00,2010/04/07 06:00,['2009/11/10 06:00'],"['2009/05/10 00:00 [received]', '2009/10/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/11/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00432-009-0704-3 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol. 2010 May;136(5):659-65. doi: 10.1007/s00432-009-0704-3.

However, limited research has been done on its great potential as sources of new therapeutic agents. The purpose of this study was to evaluate Physalis peruviana cytotoxic activity on cell lines HT-29, PC-3, K-562 and VERO. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The HT-29 cell lines, PC-3, K-562 and VERO, were exposed to four concentrations of P. peruviana ethanolic leave and stem extracts, also at different concentrations of cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), which were used as positive controls. We found rates of growth within 48 hours, then we determined the inhibitory concentration 50 (IC50) using linear regression analysis and the index of selectivity of each sample. RESULTS: The P. peruviana ethanolic leave and stem extracts showed cytotoxic activity. The IC50 in g/mL in leaves and stems were, 0.35 (r =-0.95 p <0.025) and 0.37 (r =- 0.90 p <0.05 ) for HT-29; 0.87 (r =-0.98 p <0.01) and 1.01 (r =-0.95 p <0.025) for PC-3; 0.02 (r =-0.98 p <0.01) and 0.03 (r =-0.98 p <0.01) for K-562; 4.9 (r =-0.95 p <0.025) and 6.2 (r =-0.98 p <0.01) for VERO. The IC50 for antineoplastic were: for cisplatin: 4.2 (r =-0.96 p <0.025), 10.3 (r =-0.97 p <0.025), 0.15 (r =-0.98 p = 0.01) and 1.1 (r =- 0.98 p = 0.01); for 5-FU: 2.3 (r =-0.97 p <0.025), 17.9 (r =-0.95 p <0.025), 0.15 (r =-0.98 p = 0.01) and 1.1 (r =-0.94 p = 0.05) for HT-29, PC-3, K562 and VERO respectively. The leaves and stems extracts selectivity index were between 5.6 and 245 for tumor cell lines evaluated, by contrast, cisplatin and 5-FU, only showed values between 0.11 and 7.3. CONCLUSIONS: The P. peruviana leaves and steams ethanolic extracts were more cytotoxic than cisplatin and 5 FU, on the lines HT-29, PC-3 and K562. Furthermore the P. peruviana cytotoxic effects were less than cisplatin and 5-FU for VERO control cells lines.","['Quispe-Mauricio, Angel', 'Callacondo, David', 'Rojas, Jose', 'Zavala, David', 'Posso, Margarita', 'Vaisberg, Abraham']","['Quispe-Mauricio A', 'Callacondo D', 'Rojas J', 'Zavala D', 'Posso M', 'Vaisberg A']","['Sociedad Cientifica de San Fernando, Universidad Nacional Major de San Marcos, Lima, Peru. angelquispe2@gmail.com']",['spa'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,Peru,Rev Gastroenterol Peru,Revista de gastroenterologia del Peru : organo oficial de la Sociedad de Gastroenterologia del Peru,9108294,,2009/11/10 06:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/11/10 06:00'],"['2009/11/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']",['06 [pii]'],ppublish,Rev Gastroenterol Peru. 2009 Jul-Sep;29(3):239-46.,3,IM,"['Colorectal Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Male', '*Physalis', '*Phytotherapy', 'Plant Extracts/*pharmacology', '*Plant Leaves', '*Plant Stems', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,['0 (Plant Extracts)'],,"Actividad citotoxica de physalis peruviana (aguaymanto) en cultivos celulares deadenocarcinoma colorectal, prostata y leucemia mieloide cronica.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

New treatment options have emerged. MATERIAL AND METHOD: This review is based on selected publications, a non-systematic search in PubMed and the authors' own research. RESULTS: Autoimmune hemolytic anemia is a heterogeneous group of diseases. The warm-antibody type is frequently associated with chronic lymphocytic leukemia or autoimmune systemic disease. Corticosteroids are still the first-line therapy and splenectomy is second-line, while rituximab has become an option in refractory disease. Blood transfusions require specific precautions such as restrictive use, extensive phenotyping of antigens and testing for alloantibodies and biological compatibility. Primary chronic cold agglutinin disease, a subgroup of cold-antibody autoimmune hemolytic anemia, is a clonal lymphoproliferative bone marrow disease. This subgroup is usually refractory to corticosteroids and patients with few clinical symptoms and slight anemia may not require drug therapy. However, in a majority, effective drugs are needed. The best documented therapy is infusions with rituximab, but new options are being tested. Immune hemolytic anemia associated with drugs occurs less frequently now than before. INTERPRETATION: Subgroups and associated or underlying disease should be identified in patients with autoimmune hemolytic anemia. The therapeutic implications of subclassification are important. Patients who have cold agglutinin disease and need therapy should be included in prospective trials.","['Berentsen, Sigbjorn', 'Sundic, Tatjana', 'Hervig, Tor', 'Tjonnfjord, Geir E']","['Berentsen S', 'Sundic T', 'Hervig T', 'Tjonnfjord GE']","['Medisinsk klinikk, Haugesund sjukehus, Helse Fonna, 5504 Haugesund, Norway. sigbjorn.berentsen@haugnett.no']",['nor'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",,Norway,Tidsskr Nor Laegeforen,"Tidsskrift for den Norske laegeforening : tidsskrift for praktisk medicin, ny raekke",0413423,,2009/11/10 06:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/11/10 06:00'],"['2009/11/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['1909110 [pii]', '10.4045/tidsskr.09.0161 [doi]']",ppublish,Tidsskr Nor Laegeforen. 2009 Nov 5;129(21):2226-31. doi: 10.4045/tidsskr.09.0161.,21,IM,"['Adult', '*Anemia, Hemolytic, Autoimmune/diagnosis/drug therapy/therapy', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived', 'Autoantibodies/blood', 'Blood Transfusion', 'Child', 'Glucocorticoids/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulins, Intravenous/therapeutic use', 'Immunologic Factors/therapeutic use', 'Prednisolone/therapeutic use', 'Rituximab']",50,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Autoantibodies)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Immunoglobulins, Intravenous)', '0 (Immunologic Factors)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', '9PHQ9Y1OLM (Prednisolone)']",,Autoimmun hemolytisk anemi.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study compares the clinical outcomes of high-risk AL patients who received PBSCs harvested from family members sharing at least one common haplotype to outcomes of high-risk AL patients who received a mixture of G-CSF-primed BM (G-BM) and peripheral blood (G-PB) harvests. The results show that PBSCT achieved inferior cumulative myeloid engraftment at 30 days after transplant (89.9 + or - 10.1% vs 100%; P=0.04), with lower cumulative incidence of grade II-IV acute GVHD (aGVHD) (37.1 + or - 16.5% vs 63.2+/-6%; P=0.058) compared with G-BM/G-PB transplant. However, both transplant protocols had similar rates of 2-year relapse (29.6 + or - 17.1% vs 34.0 + or - 5.7%; P=0.954), and PBSCT produced a higher incidence of 2-year non-leukemic mortality (62.5 + or - 14.8% vs 35.1 + or - 5.1%; P=0.014), as well as lower rates of overall (26.8 + or - 12.3% vs 43.2 + or - 5.0%; P=0.052) and disease-free survival (26.8 + or - 12.3% vs 42.4 + or - 5.0%; P=0.071) compared with G-BM/G-PB transplant. These results suggest that haploidentical HSCT is an option for patients with AL who urgently need a graft and do not have matched sibling donors. PBSCT is potentially inferior to G-BM/G-PB transplant, and improvements should be made before PBSCT becomes a routine in unmanipulated mismatched/haploidentical transplant settings.","['Xu, L-P', 'Liu, K-Y', 'Liu, D-H', 'Chen, H', 'Han, W', 'Chen, Y-H', 'Wang, Y', 'Huang, X-J']","['Xu LP', 'Liu KY', 'Liu DH', 'Chen H', 'Han W', 'Chen YH', 'Wang Y', 'Huang XJ']","[""Department of Hematology, Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing, PR China.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091109,England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,,2009/11/10 06:00,2010/09/30 06:00,['2009/11/10 06:00'],"['2009/11/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/30 06:00 [medline]']","['bmt2009311 [pii]', '10.1038/bmt.2009.311 [doi]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2010 Jun;45(6):985-92. doi: 10.1038/bmt.2009.311.

Missing KIR-L, whether considering HLA-Bw and HLA-C alleles, without or with HLA-A ligands or narrowing to only HLA-C alleles alone to classify the number of missing KIR-L, did not have any impact on OS or relapse-free survival.

We examined expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) encoded on chromosome 5q as a possible cause of haploinsufficiency. We show that deletion of chromosome 5q correlates with loss of two miRNAs that are abundant in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs), miR-145 and miR-146a, and we identify Toll-interleukin-1 receptor domain-containing adaptor protein (TIRAP) and tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor-6 (TRAF6) as respective targets of these miRNAs. TIRAP is known to lie upstream of TRAF6 in innate immune signaling. Knockdown of miR-145 and miR-146a together or enforced expression of TRAF6 in mouse HSPCs resulted in thrombocytosis, mild neutropenia and megakaryocytic dysplasia. A subset of mice transplanted with TRAF6-expressing marrow progressed either to marrow failure or acute myeloid leukemia. Thus, inappropriate activation of innate immune signals in HSPCs phenocopies several clinical features of 5q- syndrome.","['Starczynowski, Daniel T', 'Kuchenbauer, Florian', 'Argiropoulos, Bob', 'Sung, Sandy', 'Morin, Ryan', 'Muranyi, Andrew', 'Hirst, Martin', 'Hogge, Donna', 'Marra, Marco', 'Wells, Richard A', 'Buckstein, Rena', 'Lam, Wan', 'Humphries, R Keith', 'Karsan, Aly']","['Starczynowski DT', 'Kuchenbauer F', 'Argiropoulos B', 'Sung S', 'Morin R', 'Muranyi A', 'Hirst M', 'Hogge D', 'Marra M', 'Wells RA', 'Buckstein R', 'Lam W', 'Humphries RK', 'Karsan A']","['British Columbia Cancer Agency Research Centre, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091108,United States,Nat Med,Nature medicine,9502015,,2009/11/10 06:00,2010/01/26 06:00,['2009/11/10 06:00'],"['2009/05/20 00:00 [received]', '2009/09/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/11/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/26 06:00 [medline]']","['nm.2054 [pii]', '10.1038/nm.2054 [doi]']",ppublish,Nat Med. 2010 Jan;16(1):49-58. doi: 10.1038/nm.2054.

Nonetheless, non-mutated IgV(H) gene rearrangement, ATM (11q22-23) and p53 (17p13) deletion are recognized as unfavorable prognosticators in chronic lymphocytic leukemia. The mRNA expression of activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID), an enzyme indispensable for somatic hypermutation processes, was claimed to be predictive of non-mutated chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells in blood. Here, we evaluated AID protein expression compared with known molecular and immunohistochemical prognostic indicators in 71 chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma patients using a tissue microarray approach. We found AID heterogeneously expressed in tumor cells as shown by colocalization analysis for CD5 and CD23. Ki-67 positive paraimmunoblasts of the proliferation centers displayed the highest expression. This observation is reflected by a significant association of AID positivity with a high proliferation rate (P=0.012). ATM deletion was detected in 10% (6/63) of patients and p53 deletion in 19% (13/67) of patients. Moreover, both ATM (P=0.002) and p53 deletion (P=0.004) were significantly associated with AID. IgV(H) gene mutation was seen in 45% (27/60) of patients. Twenty-five percent (17/69) of patients with AID-positive chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma displayed a shorter survival than AID-negative chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma patients (61 vs 130 months, P=0.001). Although there was a trend, we could not show an association with the IgV(H) gene mutation status. Taken together, our study shows that AID expression is an indicator of an unfavorable prognosis in chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma patients, although it is not a surrogate marker for the IgV(H) status. Furthermore, the microenvironment of proliferation centers seems to influence AID regulation and might be an initiating factor in its transformation.","['Leuenberger, Mona', 'Frigerio, Simona', 'Wild, Peter J', 'Noetzli, Franziska', 'Korol, Dimitri', 'Zimmermann, Dieter R', 'Gengler, Carole', 'Probst-Hensch, Nicole M', 'Moch, Holger', 'Tinguely, Marianne']","['Leuenberger M', 'Frigerio S', 'Wild PJ', 'Noetzli F', 'Korol D', 'Zimmermann DR', 'Gengler C', 'Probst-Hensch NM', 'Moch H', 'Tinguely M']","['Department of Pathology, Institute of Surgical Pathology, University Hospital, CH-8091Zurich, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091106,United States,Mod Pathol,"Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc",8806605,,2009/11/10 06:00,2010/04/24 06:00,['2009/11/10 06:00'],"['2009/11/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/24 06:00 [medline]']","['modpathol2009156 [pii]', '10.1038/modpathol.2009.156 [doi]']",ppublish,Mod Pathol. 2010 Feb;23(2):177-86. doi: 10.1038/modpathol.2009.156.

Steroid-refractory acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) remains a significant cause of mortality after allogeneic stem-cell transplantation and therapeutic options are not codified. We retrospectively evaluated the role of rapamycin in this setting. METHODS: In this retrospective single-center study, 22 patients were identified, from October 2004 to February 2008, as having received rapamycin for acute GVHD refractory to one or more lines of treatment. We analyzed the efficacy and tolerance of rapamycin and the outcome of these 22 patients in this setting. RESULTS: Rapamycin resulted in a rapid and sustained complete remission of GVHD in 72% of heavily pretreated patients. Cytopenias were frequent but did not require treatment interruption. Thrombotic microangiopathy developed in 36% of patients when rapamycin was associated with calcineurin inhibitors and frequently resolved after interruption of one or both drugs. At a median follow-up of 13 months, overall survival was 41%. Previous treatment with high-dose steroid pulses was associated with a worse outcome (survival 12% vs. 69%). The major cause of death was infectious complications (77%). CONCLUSION: Despite a small and heterogeneous population of patients, these results are encouraging and provide a rationale for prospective studies that use rapamycin in steroid-refractory acute GVHD as a second- or third-line agent.","['Ghez, David', 'Rubio, Marie Therese', 'Maillard, Natacha', 'Suarez, Felipe', 'Chandesris, Marie-Olivia', 'Delarue, Richard', 'Deau-Fischer, Benedicte', 'Varet, Bruno', 'Hermine, Olivier', 'Buzyn, Agnes']","['Ghez D', 'Rubio MT', 'Maillard N', 'Suarez F', 'Chandesris MO', 'Delarue R', 'Deau-Fischer B', 'Varet B', 'Hermine O', 'Buzyn A']","['Adult Hematology Department, Hopital Necker-Enfants Malades, Paris, France. david.ghez@nck.aphp.fr']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Transplantation,Transplantation,0132144,,2009/11/10 06:00,2010/01/07 06:00,['2009/11/10 06:00'],"['2009/11/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/07 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/TP.0b013e3181ba0a13 [doi]', '00007890-200911150-00006 [pii]']",ppublish,Transplantation. 2009 Nov 15;88(9):1081-7. doi: 10.1097/TP.0b013e3181ba0a13.,9,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bacterial Infections/epidemiology', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*drug therapy/epidemiology/immunology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods/mortality', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia/immunology/mortality/*surgery', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/immunology/surgery', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sirolimus/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Survival Rate', 'Survivors', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",,"['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', 'W36ZG6FT64 (Sirolimus)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Published data describing the age-specific incidence of chromosomal abnormalities and their prognostic relevance are largely derived from clinical trials. Trials frequently have age restrictions and low recruitment rates. Thus we investigated these factors in a population-based cohort of 349 patients diagnosed during the course of 19 years in the northern part of England. The incidence of most chromosomal abnormalities varied significantly with age. The incidence of t(9;22)(q34;q11) increased in each successive decade, up to 24% among 40- to 49-year-old subjects. Thereafter the incidence reached a plateau. t(4;11)(q21;q23) and t(1;19)(q23;p13) were a rare occurrence among patients older than 60 years of age. In contrast, the frequency of t(8;14)(q24;q32) and t(14;18)(q32;q21) increased with age. High hyperdiploidy occurred in 13% of patients younger than 20 years of age but in only 5% of older patients. The incidence of low hypodiploidy/near-triploidy and complex karyotype increased with age from 4% (15-29 years) to 16% (>or= 60 years). Overall survival varied significantly by age and cytogenetics. Older patients and those with t(9;22), t(4;11), low hypodiploidy/near-triploidy, or complex karyotype had a significantly inferior outcome.

We demonstrate that concomitant inhibition of MDM2 by nutlin-3a and of XIAP by small molecule antagonists synergistically induced apoptosis in p53 wild-type OCI-AML3 and Molm13 cells. Knockdown of p53 by shRNA blunted the synergy, and down-regulation of XIAP by antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) enhanced nutlin-3a-induced apoptosis, suggesting that the synergy was mediated by p53 activation and XIAP inhibition. This is supported by data showing that inhibition of both MDM2 and XIAP by their respective ASOs induced significantly more cell death than either ASO alone. Importantly, p53 activation and XIAP inhibition enhanced apoptosis in blasts from patients with primary AML, even when the cells were protected by stromal cells. Mechanistic studies demonstrated that XIAP inhibition potentiates p53-induced apoptosis by decreasing p53-induced p21 and that p53 activation enhances XIAP inhibition-induced cell death by promoting mitochondrial release of second mitochondria-derived activator of caspases (SMAC) and by inducing the expression of caspase-6. Because both XIAP and p53 are presently being targeted in ongoing clinical trials in leukemia, the combination strategy holds promise for expedited translation into the clinic.","['Carter, Bing Z', 'Mak, Duncan H', 'Schober, Wendy D', 'Koller, Erich', 'Pinilla, Clemencia', 'Vassilev, Lyubomir T', 'Reed, John C', 'Andreeff, Michael']","['Carter BZ', 'Mak DH', 'Schober WD', 'Koller E', 'Pinilla C', 'Vassilev LT', 'Reed JC', 'Andreeff M']","['Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas M.

Here, we analyzed the global methylation profiles in CLL, by applying high-resolution methylation microarrays (27,578 CpG sites) to 23 CLL samples, belonging to the immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable (IGHV) mutated (favorable) and IGHV unmutated/IGHV3-21 (poor-prognostic) subsets. Overall, results demonstrated significant differences in methylation patterns between these subgroups. Specifically, in IGHV unmutated CLL, we identified methylation of 7 known or candidate tumor suppressor genes (eg, VHL, ABI3, and IGSF4) as well as 8 unmethylated genes involved in cell proliferation and tumor progression (eg, ADORA3 and PRF1 enhancing the nuclear factor-kappaB and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways, respectively). In contrast, these latter genes were silenced by methylation in IGHV mutated patients. The array data were validated for selected genes using methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction, quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, and bisulfite sequencing. Finally, the significance of DNA methylation in regulating gene promoters was shown by reinducing 4 methylated tumor suppressor genes (eg, VHL and ABI3) in IGHV unmutated samples using the methyl-inhibitor 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine. Taken together, our data for the first time reveal differences in global methylation profiles between prognostic subsets of CLL, which may unfold epigenetic silencing mechanisms involved in CLL pathogenesis.","['Kanduri, Meena', 'Cahill, Nicola', 'Goransson, Hanna', 'Enstrom, Camilla', 'Ryan, Fergus', 'Isaksson, Anders', 'Rosenquist, Richard']","['Kanduri M', 'Cahill N', 'Goransson H', 'Enstrom C', 'Ryan F', 'Isaksson A', 'Rosenquist R']","['Department of Genetics and Pathology, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091106,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,2009/11/10 06:00,2010/01/29 06:00,['2009/11/10 06:00'],"['2009/11/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/29 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)49363-2 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2009-07-232868 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 Jan 14;115(2):296-305. doi: 10.1182/blood-2009-07-232868.

While their major effect is on protein levels of target genes, it has been proven that they also specifically impact on the messenger RNA level of targets. Prominent interest in miRNAs strongly motivates the need for increasing the options available to detect their cellular activity. RESULTS: We used the effect of miRNAs over their targets for the detection of miRNA activity using mRNAs expression profiles. Here we describe the method, called T-REX (from Targets' Reverse EXpression), compare it to other similar applications, show its effectiveness and apply it to build activity maps. We used six different target predictions from each of four algorithms: TargetScan, PicTar, DIANA-microT and DIANA Union. First, we proved the sensitivity and specificity of our technique in miRNA over-expression and knock-out animal models. Then, we used whole transcriptome data from acute myeloid leukemia to show that we could identify critical miRNAs in a real life, complex, clinically relevant dataset. Finally, we studied 66 different cellular conditions to confirm and extend the current knowledge on the role of miRNAs in cellular physiology and in cancer.

Recently, THL has been shown to induce apoptosis in various types of solid tumor cells in vitro. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms have not yet been well elucidated. In this study, we explored the effects of THL on acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) NB4 cells, which could be effectively treated by some traditional Chinese remedies containing arsenic trioxide. The results showed THL could induce G2/M arrest and apoptosis in NB4 cells. Accordingly, the decrease of cyclin A and B1 were observed in THL-treated cells. The THL-induced apoptosis was accompanied with caspase-3 activation and decrease of PML-RARalpha fusion protein. Moreover, DNA methyltransferase 1 and oncogenic signaling pathways such as Akt/mTOR, Stat3 and ERK were also down-regulated by THL. By using ethyl acetate extraction and silica gel chromatography, an active fraction of THL named as EAS5 was isolated. At about 0.5-1% of the dose of THL, EAS5 appeared to have most of THL-induced multiple molecular targeting effects in NB4 cells. Based on the findings of these multi-targeting effects, THL might be regarding as a complementary and alternative therapeutic agent for refractory APL.","['Yao, Chih-Jung', 'Yang, Chia-Ming', 'Chuang, Shuang-En', 'Yan, Jiann-Long', 'Liu, Chun-Yen', 'Chen, Suz-Wen', 'Yan, Kun-Huang', 'Lai, Tung-Yuan', 'Lai, Gi-Ming']","['Yao CJ', 'Yang CM', 'Chuang SE', 'Yan JL', 'Liu CY', 'Chen SW', 'Yan KH', 'Lai TY', 'Lai GM']","['Cancer Center, Taipei Medical University-Wan Fang Hospital, Taiwan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20110220,United States,Evid Based Complement Alternat Med,Evidence-based complementary and alternative medicine : eCAM,101215021,PMC3137877,2009/11/10 06:00,2009/11/10 06:01,['2009/11/10 06:00'],"['2009/06/23 00:00 [received]', '2009/09/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/11/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/11/10 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1093/ecam/nep165 [doi]', 'nep165 [pii]']",ppublish,Evid Based Complement Alternat Med. 2011;2011:984154. doi: 10.1093/ecam/nep165.

Numerous experiments from different laboratories generate an abundance of individual components and causal interactions mediating environmental and developmental signals. However, for many signal transduction systems there is insufficient information on the overall structure and the molecular mechanisms involved in the signaling network. Moreover, lack of kinetic and temporal information makes it difficult to construct quantitative models of signal transduction pathways. Discrete dynamic modeling, combined with network analysis, provides an effective way to integrate fragmentary knowledge of regulatory interactions into a predictive mathematical model which is able to describe the time evolution of the system without the requirement for kinetic parameters. This chapter introduces the fundamental concepts of discrete dynamic modeling, particularly focusing on Boolean dynamic models. We describe this method step-by-step in the context of cellular signaling networks. Several variants of Boolean dynamic models including threshold Boolean networks and piecewise linear systems are also covered, followed by two examples of successful application of discrete dynamic modeling in cell biology.","['Albert, Reka', 'Wang, Rui-Sheng']","['Albert R', 'Wang RS']","['Department of Physics, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania, USA.', 'Department of Physics, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",,United States,Methods Enzymol,Methods in enzymology,0212271,,2009/11/10 06:00,2010/01/12 06:00,['2009/11/10 06:00'],"['2009/11/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/12 06:00 [medline]']","['S0076-6879(09)67011-7 [pii]', '10.1016/S0076-6879(09)67011-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Methods Enzymol. 2009;467:281-306. doi: 10.1016/S0076-6879(09)67011-7.,,IM,"['Abscisic Acid/metabolism', 'Animals', '*Computer Simulation', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Feedback, Physiological', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Large Granular Lymphocytic/immunology', '*Models, Biological', 'Nonlinear Dynamics', 'Plant Growth Regulators/metabolism', 'Plants/metabolism', 'Protein Interaction Mapping/*methods', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology']",,"['0 (Plant Growth Regulators)', '72S9A8J5GW (Abscisic Acid)']",,,['R01 GM083113-01/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

IRF4 is involved in the differentiation of B and T cells and is overexpressed in B-cell malignancies as a result of c-REL (NF-kappaB) hyperactivation. IRF4 polymorphisms are associated with susceptibility to chronic lymphoid leukemia (CLL) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). We examined 13 IRF4 SNPs in 114 cases of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and 388 newborn controls from Wales (U.K.) using TaqMan assays. IRF4 intron 4 SNP rs12203592 showed a male-specific risk association (OR=4.4, 95% CI=1.5 to 12.6, P=0.007). Functional consequences of the C>T substitution at this SNP were assessed by cell-based reporter assays using three different cell lines. We found a repressive effect of the rs12203592 wildtype allele C on IRF4 promoter activity (P<0.001) but no repression by the variant allele in any cell line tested. Thus, homozygosity for the rs12203592 variant allele would result in increased IRF4 expression. This increase would be compounded by high levels of NF-kappaB activity in males due to the absence of estrogen. IRF4 differs from other IRFs in its anti-interferon activity which interferes with immune surveillance. We propose that a detailed study of IRF4 can provide information on the mechanism of the sex effect and the role of immune surveillance in childhood ALL development.","['Do, Thuy N', 'Ucisik-Akkaya, Esma', 'Davis, Charronne F', 'Morrison, Brittany A', 'Dorak, M Tevfik']","['Do TN', 'Ucisik-Akkaya E', 'Davis CF', 'Morrison BA', 'Dorak MT']","['Genomic Immunoepidemiology Laboratory, HUMIGEN LLC, The Institute for Genetic Immunology, 2439 Kuser Road, Hamilton, NJ 08690-3303, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091106,Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,,2009/11/10 06:00,2010/04/02 06:00,['2009/11/10 06:00'],"['2009/08/12 00:00 [received]', '2009/10/27 00:00 [revised]', '2009/10/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/11/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/02 06:00 [medline]']","['S0925-4439(09)00251-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbadis.2009.10.015 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 2010 Feb;1802(2):292-300. doi: 10.1016/j.bbadis.2009.10.015.

Transfection efficiency and cell viability were assessed using fluorescent microscopy and flow cytometry analysis, respectively. Knock-down of target protein by siRNA was assessed by immunoblotting. Moreover, sonoporation was used to stably transfect RL cells with a plasmid coding for luciferase (pGL3). These cells were then used for the non-invasive monitoring of tumorigenesis in immunodeficient SCID mice. Sonoporation allows a highly efficient transfection of nucleic acid in suspension cells with a low rate of mortality, both in a tumor cell line and in fresh human leukemic cells.

Further study of the biological functions of miR-138 might be helpful for developing possible strategies to treat leukemia.","['Zhao, Xiaohong', 'Yang, Li', 'Hu, Jianguo', 'Ruan, Jigang']","['Zhao X', 'Yang L', 'Hu J', 'Ruan J']","[""Subsidary Hospital, The Medical University of Ningxia Province, Changle St 17, Yin'chuan 750001, Ningxia Province, China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091106,England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,,2009/11/10 06:00,2010/06/25 06:00,['2009/11/10 06:00'],"['2009/09/20 00:00 [received]', '2009/09/21 00:00 [revised]', '2009/10/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/11/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/25 06:00 [medline]']","['S0145-2126(09)00495-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2009.10.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2010 Aug;34(8):1078-82. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2009.10.002.

Previously, we showed that exposure to nicotine activates the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) transcription factor in lymphocytes and endothelial cells, leading to alterations in cellular growth and vascular endothelial growth factor production. Here, we extend these studies to document effects of nicotine on lymphocyte survival. The data show that nicotine induces paradoxical effects that might alternatively enforce survival or trigger apoptosis, suggesting that depending on timing and context, nicotine might act both as a survival factor or as an inducer of apoptosis in normal or transformed lymphocytes, and possibly other non-neuronal cells. In addition, our results show that, while having overlapping functions, low and high affinity nAChRs also transmit signals that promote distinct outcomes in lymphocytes. The sum of our data suggests that selective modulation of nAChRs might be useful to regulate lymphocyte activation and survival in health and disease.","['Oloris, Silvia C S', 'Frazer-Abel, Ashley A', 'Jubala, Cristan M', 'Fosmire, Susan P', 'Helm, Karen M', 'Robinson, Sally R', 'Korpela, Derek M', 'Duckett, Megan M', 'Baksh, Shairaz', 'Modiano, Jaime F']","['Oloris SC', 'Frazer-Abel AA', 'Jubala CM', 'Fosmire SP', 'Helm KM', 'Robinson SR', 'Korpela DM', 'Duckett MM', 'Baksh S', 'Modiano JF']","['Integrated Department of Immunology, School of Medicine, University of Colorado, Denver, Denver, CO, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20091104,United States,Toxicol Appl Pharmacol,Toxicology and applied pharmacology,0416575,PMC2813922,2009/11/10 06:00,2010/02/19 06:00,['2009/11/10 06:00'],"['2009/05/07 00:00 [received]', '2009/10/12 00:00 [revised]', '2009/10/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/11/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/19 06:00 [medline]']","['S0041-008X(09)00465-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.taap.2009.10.020 [doi]']",ppublish,Toxicol Appl Pharmacol. 2010 Feb 1;242(3):299-309. doi: 10.1016/j.taap.2009.10.020.

To date, less than 200 animals remain in the wild. Low numbers and genetic uniformity may contribute to render this species particularly susceptible to infectious diseases. Different pathogens have been identified in Iberian lynxes; including several feline bacterial and viral agents. Within a 6-month period starting in December 2006, 12 lynxes living in the northern part of the Donana area were found to be infected with feline leukemia virus (FeLV). Eleven of these animals were antigenemic, and four of them died in the wild in less than 6 months since the first infected animal had been discovered. The remaining viremic lynxes were captured and allocated to a quarantine center to stop the spread of the infection. An additional three animals died shortly in the quarantine center due to acute anemic disease. Sequencing of the envelope surface unit gene revealed a common origin for the FeLV found in all lynxes. The sequences were closely related to FeLV-A/61E, originally isolated from cats in the USA. Our data demonstrate that, similarly to FeLV, the introduction of a new or particularly pathogenic infection brought into the small population of Iberian lynxes by other wild carnivores or feral cats and dogs roaming in the same habitats have severe consequences. It could result in epidemics that have the potential to eradicate the entire lynx population.","['Meli, Marina L', 'Cattori, Valentino', 'Martinez, Fernando', 'Lopez, Guillermo', 'Vargas, Astrid', 'Palomares, Francisco', 'Lopez-Bao, Jose V', 'Hofmann-Lehmann, Regina', 'Lutz, Hans']","['Meli ML', 'Cattori V', 'Martinez F', 'Lopez G', 'Vargas A', 'Palomares F', 'Lopez-Bao JV', 'Hofmann-Lehmann R', 'Lutz H']","['Clinical Laboratory, Vetsuisse Faculty, University of Zurich, Winterthurerstrasse 260, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland. mmeli@vetclinics.uzh.ch']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20091014,Netherlands,Vet Immunol Immunopathol,Veterinary immunology and immunopathology,8002006,PMC7127500,2009/11/10 06:00,2010/05/04 06:00,['2009/11/10 06:00'],"['2009/11/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/04 06:00 [medline]']","['S0165-2427(09)00336-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.vetimm.2009.10.010 [doi]']",ppublish,Vet Immunol Immunopathol. 2010 Mar 15;134(1-2):61-7. doi: 10.1016/j.vetimm.2009.10.010.

LGLs, generally considered to be analogous to natural killer (NK) cells, can also be highly cytolytic CD8/CD57 T cells. Neutropenia has been reported during acute human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) infection, but there is a paucity of information describing the pathogenesis of this condition. During HIV-1 infection, LGLs have been shown to be both CD16(+) NK cells and CD8(+)/CD57(+) T cells, but an association with neutropenia has not been described. However, neutropenia with concurrent LGL lymphocytosis has been demonstrated in both LGL leukemia and common variable immunodeficiency syndrome in people, and in both syndromes, an increase in soluble Fas ligand (FasL) has been associated with neutrophil apoptosis leading to neutropenia. Flow cytometric analysis demonstrated increases in CD56 and CD8 peripheral blood cell surface expression during acute FIV-C-PG infection. Expression of FasL mRNA was increased at the same time points as these peripheral hematologic abnormalities, and also decreased as FIV-C-PG proviral load reached set point. We describe an interesting temporal association between innate immune responses and viral load during acute FIV-C-PG infection, which has similarities to HIV-1 infection and other immune dyscrasias of people, and which may contribute to the neutropenia and LGL lymphocytosis during FIV-C-PG infection.","['Sprague, W S', 'TerWee, J A', 'VandeWoude, S']","['Sprague WS', 'TerWee JA', 'VandeWoude S']","['Colorado State University, Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Pathology, 1600 Campus Delivery, Fort Collins, CO, USA. wsprague@lamar.colostate.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20091014,Netherlands,Vet Immunol Immunopathol,Veterinary immunology and immunopathology,8002006,PMC2821998,2009/11/10 06:00,2010/05/04 06:00,['2009/11/10 06:00'],"['2009/11/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/04 06:00 [medline]']","['S0165-2427(09)00342-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.vetimm.2009.10.016 [doi]']",ppublish,Vet Immunol Immunopathol. 2010 Mar 15;134(1-2):115-21. doi: 10.1016/j.vetimm.2009.10.016.

Marked declines in total fertility rates in Canada over the past 50 years will lead to increasing numbers of patients without sibling donors well into the future. We retrieved transplantation data from a Canadian center and the Canadian Blood and Marrow Transplant Group and total fertility data from the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs. The mean age of adults with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), who underwent transplantation at The Ottawa Hospital between 1995 and 2004, was 41 +/- 12 years (n = 87). The chance of finding 1 or more HLA-matched sibling donors for a patient with AML treated in 2002 is reflected by the total fertility rate in 1961 (average birth year for patients and sibling donors). The sibling rate for 1961 is the total fertility rate-1.0, or 2.68. The chance of having 1 or more HLA-matched sibling is 53.7% (1-chances of no matched sibling, or 1 - 0.75(2.68)). In 2009, the chance of identifying a matched sibling is only 37.1%, because of declining total fertility rates. Following this trend, this chance will be 24.6% in 2014 and 16.6% in 2024. Greater reliance on alternative donors, such as umbilical cord blood (UCB) and HLA-mismatched donors, can be anticipated. The issue of declining fertility rates appears to be regional, and the impact on transplantation will be more pronounced in Canada than in other developed nations.","['Allan, David S', 'Takach, Sarah', 'Smith, Susan', 'Goldman, Mindy']","['Allan DS', 'Takach S', 'Smith S', 'Goldman M']","['Blood and Marrow Transplant Program, The Ottawa Hospital, and University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Canada. daallan@ohri.ca']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20090901,United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,,2009/11/10 06:00,2010/03/04 06:00,['2009/11/10 06:00'],"['2009/06/10 00:00 [received]', '2009/07/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/11/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/04 06:00 [medline]']","['S1083-8791(09)00339-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbmt.2009.07.007 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2009 Dec;15(12):1634-7. doi: 10.1016/j.bbmt.2009.07.007.

Because the long-term morbidity of busulfan (Bu)-based regimens appears to be lower, determining efficacy is critical. We retrospectively evaluated 151 pediatric patients with AML beyond CR1, comparing outcomes in 90 patients who received a TBI-based conditioning regimen and 61 patients who received a Bu-based conditioning regimen. There were no differences between the 2 groups with respect to age, sex, duration of CR1, time from most recent remission to transplantation, or donor source. The probability of relapse at 2 years also did not differ between the 2 groups (26% and 27%, respectively; P=.93). No significant difference in event-free survival (EFS) (P=.29) or overall survival (OS) (P=.11) was noted between the 2 groups.

To evaluate this, we examined the feasibility of deescalating the dose of alemtuzumab (MabCampath) in combination with cyclosporine (CsA) as the sole GVHD-prophylaxis in patients after fludarabine (Flu)-based reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) in an observational cohort study. We included 127 consecutive patients (median age 63 years) with an unrelated (UD; n=69) or related donor (SIB; n=58) after their first transplantation, mostly presenting with advanced disease. The first 30 patients received 20 mg/day on day -2 and -1 (40 mg), the following 48 patients 10 mg/day on day -2 and -1 (20 mg), and the last 49 patients 10 mg on day -1 (10 mg) alemtuzumab intravenous (i.v.) prior to transplant. We observed no statistical differences comparing the 40 mg, 20 mg, or 10 mg dose groups, in terms of cumulative incidences of aGVHD grade III-IV 7% (confidence interval [CI] 95%; 1-51), 12% (1-40), 6% (1-40), extensive chronic GVHD (cGVHD) 24.4% (3.3-55.8), 17% (2.5-42), and 14.2% (1.5-41.5) and of aGVHD grade II-IV 7 % (0-51.5), 29% (11.9-49.1), 21% (15.3-43.1), respectively. The difference between the 20-mg and 40-mg groups was significant for aGVHD grade II-IV(P < .05). In conclusion, we demonstrate the feasibility of reducing the dose of alemtuzumab as GVHD-prophylaxis to 10 mg absolute in combination with CsA only for UD transplantation in particular.","['Bertz, Hartmut', 'Spyridonidis, Alexandros', 'Wasch, Ralph', 'Grullich, Carsten', 'Egger, Mathias', 'Finke, Jurgen']","['Bertz H', 'Spyridonidis A', 'Wasch R', 'Grullich C', 'Egger M', 'Finke J']","['Albert Ludwigs-University Medical Center Freiburg, Department of Hematology and Oncology, Freiburg, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20091001,United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,,2009/11/10 06:00,2010/03/04 06:00,['2009/11/10 06:00'],"['2009/05/08 00:00 [received]', '2009/08/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/11/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/04 06:00 [medline]']","['S1083-8791(09)00366-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbmt.2009.08.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2009 Dec;15(12):1563-70. doi: 10.1016/j.bbmt.2009.08.002.

Inferior outcomes among African Americans are not fully explained by transplant-related factors or SES. Potential other mechanisms such as genetic polymorphisms that have an impact on drug metabolism or unmeasured comorbidities, socioeconomic factors, and health behaviors may be important.

This finding revealed that not all tumor cells are able to divide indefinitely, and that the bulk of tumor cells are expanded because of divisions and differentiation of CSC fraction. Although the CSCs identified in acute leukemia have a phenotype of early hematopoietic progenitors, it seems that CSCs in multiple myeloma (MM) may resemble the memory B cell fraction. Previous studies in patients with MM have documented the existence of cells without plasma cell characteristics expressing MM-type immunoglobulin genes--so-called ""clonotypic"" B cells. These cells have been characterized functionally and phenotypically as chemoresistant recirculating B cells. They have been found to self-renew and to be capable of initiating MM growth in immunocompromised animals. Controversy exists as to whether these cells truly belong to an MM clone, however; they may represent only the remaining clones of premalignant B cells. The identification of MM stem cells responsible for the recurrence of MM is of primary importance in designing targeted therapies to definitely cure this disease.

Circulating CD52 (cCD52) and CD20 (cCD20) have prognostic utility in lymphoid malignancies. The efficacy of mAb therapy in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) may be adversely affected by cCD52 or cCD20. In this report, blood and bone marrow (BM) cCD52 and cCD20 were measured at response assessment in previously treated (N = 235) patients with CLL who received fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab (FCR). Univariate and multivariate statistical models evaluated correlations of pre- and response variables with progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Response variables included 1996 National Cancer Institute-Working Group (NCI-WG) response, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGHV) in BM, and cCD52 and cCD20 levels (blood and BM) at response assessment. Using multivariate analysis, response blood and BM cCD52, blood cCD20, and NCI-WG response were significant independent predictors of PFS. At the time of response assessment, BM cCD52 correlated with OS in univariate analysis. cCD52 and cCD20, therefore appear useful in predicting survival and may be important for monitoring patients following salvage FCR (fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, rituximab) therapy.

We also analyzed outcome in 217 additional patients with deletion 11q22.3 or 17p13.1, or trisomy 12, based on whether these occurred in isolation or in conjunction with 13q-. Patients with a heterozygous 13q- and those with a homozygous deletion had similar time to first treatment (TFT) and overall survival (OS). In contrast, a higher percentage of 13q- nuclei was associated with significantly shorter TFT (P < 0.001). The 5-year untreated rate was 79% for patients with isolated 13q- in < or =65.5% of nuclei compared to 38% among those with 13q- in >65.5% of nuclei (P < 0.001). The percentage of nuclei exhibiting 13q- remained an independent predictor of TFT after controlling for ZAP-70, IGHV, or CD38 (all P < 0.001). Among patients with 13q- plus one other FISH abnormality, concomitant 13q- appeared to attenuate the shorter survival associated with 17p- (P = 0.019).

Increased frequencies of CD4(+)CTLs have since been attributed to chronic viral infections, particularly, human cytomegalovirus (HCMV). The present study examined the involvement of CD4(+)CTLs in responses to HCMV in B-CLL, and characterized their differentiation. We studied 36 HCMV seropositive (SP) and seronegative B-CLL patients and 20 healthy age-matched individuals. The HCMV reactivity of CD4(+)PF(+) and CD4(+)PF(-) cells was determined by interferon-gamma expression, and expression of CD45RA and CCR7 was assessed by flow cytometry. Fluorescence in-situ hybridization was used to measure relative telomere lengths. CD4(+)PF(+)T cell expansion in B-CLL patients and controls was strongly associated with HCMV seropositivity. CD4(+)PF(+) compared to CD4(+)PF(-) cells from SP B-CLL patients elicited major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II-restricted responses to HCMV. CD4(+)PF(+)T cells from patients and controls were enriched with highly differentiated T-effector/memory (CCR7(-)) and revertant (CCR7(-)CD45RA(+)) phenotype. CD4(+)PF(+)T cells from B-CLL patients had shorter telomeres than CD4(+)PF(-)T cells, indicating an extensive replicative history. We conclude that persistent exposure to HCMV antigens in SP B-CLL patients leads to an expansion of the circulating MHC class II-restricted CD4(+)PF(+)T cell population with effector/memory phenotype.","['Walton, James A', 'Lydyard, Peter M', 'Nathwani, Amit', 'Emery, Vincent', 'Akbar, Arne', 'Glennie, Martin J', 'Porakishvili, Nino']","['Walton JA', 'Lydyard PM', 'Nathwani A', 'Emery V', 'Akbar A', 'Glennie MJ', 'Porakishvili N']","['University of Westminster, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091104,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,2009/11/10 06:00,2010/05/12 06:00,['2009/11/10 06:00'],"['2009/11/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/12 06:00 [medline]']","['BJH7964 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2009.07964.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2010 Jan;148(2):274-84. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2009.07964.x.

Distinct variable-gene usage profiles were identified between ALL subgroups, particularly for patients positive for BCR-ABL1 compared to MLL-AFF1 positive leukaemias; suggesting that the former is derived from a more mature B progenitor. Interestingly, occurrence of TRGV1-TRGV8 was prognostic for better event-free survival (31% at 4 years with vs. 0% at 4 years without, P = 0.05).

Here, we aimed to address the applicability of rearranged antigen-receptor genes as potential MRD markers using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR) in a Swedish population-based cohort. From 334 childhood ALL cases diagnosed during 2002-2006, we analysed 279 diagnostic samples (84%) by screening for rearranged immunoglobulin (IG) and T-cell receptor (TCR) genes. Allele-specific oligonucleotides were designed, and the sensitivity and quantitative level was determined for each target. Overall, clonal IG/TCR rearrangements were detected in 97% (236/244) of B-cell precursor ALL (BCP ALL) and 94% (33/35) of T-ALL. A sensitive RQ-PCR analysis (< or = 10(-4)) was obtained in 89% (216/244) of BCP ALL and in 74% (26/35) of T-ALL, whereas two sensitive targets were only available in 47% (115/244) of BCP ALL and 29% (10/35) of T-ALL cases. With the stratification threshold of > or = 10(-3), which is applied in the current Nordic treatment protocol (NOPHO-ALL 2008) for the identification of high-risk patients, 93% of BCP ALL and 86% of T-ALL reached this quantitative range by at least one target gene. Taken together, this national retrospective study demonstrates that an IG/TCR target for MRD monitoring can be identified in the majority of childhood ALL cases, whereas identification of a second sensitive target gene needs to be improved.","['Thorn, Ingrid', 'Forestier, Erik', 'Thuresson, Britt', 'Wasslavik, Carina', 'Malec, Maria', 'Li, Aihong', 'Lindstrom-Eriksson, Elenor', 'Botling, Johan', 'Barbany, Gisela', 'Jacobsson, Stefan', 'Olofsson, Tor', 'Porwit, Anna', 'Sundstrom, Christer', 'Rosenquist, Richard']","['Thorn I', 'Forestier E', 'Thuresson B', 'Wasslavik C', 'Malec M', 'Li A', 'Lindstrom-Eriksson E', 'Botling J', 'Barbany G', 'Jacobsson S', 'Olofsson T', 'Porwit A', 'Sundstrom C', 'Rosenquist R']","['Department of Genetics and Pathology, Rudbeck Laboratory, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20091106,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,,2009/11/10 06:00,2010/02/26 06:00,['2009/11/10 06:00'],"['2009/11/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/26 06:00 [medline]']","['EJH1374 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-0609.2009.01374.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2010 Feb 1;84(2):117-27. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2009.01374.x.

Treatment of the disease with imatinib (Gleevec) often results in drug resistance via kinase mutations at the advanced phases of the disease, which has necessitated the development of new mutation-resistant inhibitors, notably against the T315I gatekeeper mutation. As part of our efforts to discover such mutation resistant Abl inhibitors, we have focused on optimizing purine template kinase inhibitors, leading to the discovery of potent DFG-in and DFG-out series of Abl inhibitors that are also potent Src inhibitors. Here we present crystal structures of Abl bound by two such inhibitors, based on a common N9-arenyl purine, and that represent both DFG-in and -out binding modes. In each structure the purine template is bound deeply in the adenine pocket and the novel vinyl linker forms a non-classical hydrogen bond to the gatekeeper residue, Thr315. Specific template substitutions promote either a DFG-in or -out binding mode, with the kinase binding site adjusting to optimize molecular recognition. Bcr-Abl T315I mutant kinase is resistant to all currently marketed Abl inhibitors, and is the focus of intense drug discovery efforts. Notably, our DFG-out inhibitor, AP24163, exhibits modest activity against this mutant, illustrating that this kinase mutant can be inhibited by DFG-out class inhibitors. Furthermore our DFG-out inhibitor exhibits dual Src-Abl activity, absent from the prototypical DFG-out inhibitor, imatinib as well as its analog, nilotinib. The data presented here provides structural guidance for the further design of novel potent DFG-out class inhibitors against Src, Abl and Abl T315I mutant kinases.","['Zhou, Tianjun', 'Commodore, Lois', 'Huang, Wei-Sheng', 'Wang, Yihan', 'Sawyer, Tomi K', 'Shakespeare, William C', 'Clackson, Tim', 'Zhu, Xiaotian', 'Dalgarno, David C']","['Zhou T', 'Commodore L', 'Huang WS', 'Wang Y', 'Sawyer TK', 'Shakespeare WC', 'Clackson T', 'Zhu X', 'Dalgarno DC']","['ARIAD Pharmaceuticals Inc, 26 Landsdowne St., Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20091105,England,Chem Biol Drug Des,Chemical biology & drug design,101262549,,2009/11/10 06:00,2010/04/28 06:00,['2009/11/10 06:00'],"['2009/11/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/28 06:00 [medline]']","['JPP905 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1747-0285.2009.00905.x [doi]']",ppublish,Chem Biol Drug Des. 2010 Jan;75(1):18-28. doi: 10.1111/j.1747-0285.2009.00905.x.

An FMG-transfected cell will fuse with neighbor cells, thus forming syncytia that die within 5 days. In this report, plasmids encoding for FMGs from Human Endogenous Retrovirus-W (HERV-W) was compared with Gibbon Ape Leukemia Virus (GALV) and feline endogenous virus RD-114 (RD). These plasmids were transfected in human non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells in vitro or directly injected into tumors in mice. All FMGs induced the formation of syncytia containing around 50 cells. HERV-W or GALV FMGs decreased up to 80% of cell viability in vitro and inhibited tumor growth in vivo (60-70% reduction). In contrast, RD FMG was not efficient. Apoptosis played a role in the death of the syncytia, but addition of the caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk had no effect, suggesting that apoptosis is not the only mechanism responsible for FMG-induced cell death. Altogether, our results demonstrate that even at very low transfection efficiency, the antitumor activity of HERV-W FMG is as effective as that of GALV in vitro and in vivo for the treatment of human lung tumors.","['Lin, E-H', 'Salon, C', 'Brambilla, E', 'Lavillette, D', 'Szecsi, J', 'Cosset, F-L', 'Coll, J-L']","['Lin EH', 'Salon C', 'Brambilla E', 'Lavillette D', 'Szecsi J', 'Cosset FL', 'Coll JL']","['INSERM U823, Institut Albert Bonniot, Grenoble, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091106,England,Cancer Gene Ther,Cancer gene therapy,9432230,,2009/11/07 06:00,2010/06/09 06:00,['2009/11/07 06:00'],"['2009/11/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/09 06:00 [medline]']","['cgt200974 [pii]', '10.1038/cgt.2009.74 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Gene Ther. 2010 Apr;17(4):256-65. doi: 10.1038/cgt.2009.74.

Combination of conventional chromosome analysis (CCA) and FISH provides higher sensitivity in detecting these genetic abnormalities, and it is effective to apply several FISH probes as a profile test. The objective of this study was to investigate the utility of FISH profile analyses in the initial diagnosis of acute leukemia. METHODS: Two hundred and forty one de novo acute leukemia patients diagnosed from January, 2002 to November, 2007 were included. For acute lymphoblastic leukemia profile test, FISH probes for BCR/ABL, TEL/AML1, MLL gene rearrangement and CDKN2A deletion were used. For acute myeloid leukemia profile test, probes for AML1/ETO, MLL and CBFbeta gene rearrangement were used. The results of CCA and FISH profile tests were collected, and the positive rates were compared. RESULTS: ALL FISH profile tests revealed additional genetic aberrations not detected by chromosome analysis in 48.6% (67/138) of cases, including those with normal karyotypes or no mitotic cells (37%, 51/138). Among these 51 cases, TEL/AML1 abnormalities were detected in 44.3%, followed by the abnormal CDKN2A signal (24.6%) and hyperdiploidy (18.0%). AML FISH profile tests revealed additional genetic abnormalities in 7.8% (8/103) of cases. CONCLUSIONS: FISH analysis as a profile test detected additional genetic aberrations in a significant proportion of acute leukemia, and was effective especially in detecting cryptic translocations, submicroscopic deletions and complex karyotypes. Our study supports the need to incorporate FISH profile test at initial work up in acute leukemia.","['Kim, Suk Ran', 'Kim, Hee Jin', 'Kim, Sun Hee']","['Kim SR', 'Kim HJ', 'Kim SH']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine & Genetics, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.']",['kor'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,Korea (South),Korean J Lab Med,The Korean journal of laboratory medicine,101322822,,2009/11/07 06:00,2010/03/12 06:00,['2009/11/07 06:00'],"['2009/11/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/12 06:00 [medline]']","['200910371 [pii]', '10.3343/kjlm.2009.29.5.371 [doi]']",ppublish,Korean J Lab Med. 2009 Oct;29(5):371-8. doi: 10.3343/kjlm.2009.29.5.371.,5,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/genetics', 'Core Binding Factor beta Subunit/genetics', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16/genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence/*methods', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr/genetics']",,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Core Binding Factor beta Subunit)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous studies have shown the association between OTX2 and OTX1 with anaplastic and desmoplastic medulloblastomas, respectively. Here, we investigated OTX1 and OTX2 expression in Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL) and multiple myeloma. A combination of semiquantitative RT-PCR, Western blot, and immunohistochemical analyses was used to measure OTX1 and OTX2 levels in normal lymphoid tissues and in 184 tumor specimens representative of various forms of NHL and multiple myeloma. OTX1 expression was activated in 94% of diffuse large B-cell lymphomas, in all Burkitt lymphomas, and in 90% of high-grade follicular lymphomas. OTX1 was undetectable in precursor-B lymphoblastic lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and in most marginal zone and mantle cell lymphomas and multiple myeloma. OTX2 was undetectable in all analyzed malignancies. Analysis of OTX1 expression in normal lymphoid tissues identified a subset of resting germinal center (GC) B cells lacking PAX5 and BCL6 and expressing cytoplasmic IgG and syndecan. About 50% of OTX1(+) GC B cells co-expressed CD10 and CD20. This study identifies OTX1 as a molecular marker for high-grade GC-derived NHL and suggests an involvement of this transcription factor in B-cell lymphomagenesis. Furthermore, OTX1 expression in a subset of normal GC B cells carrying plasma cell markers suggests its possible contribution to terminal B-cell differentiation.","['Omodei, Daniela', 'Acampora, Dario', 'Russo, Filippo', 'De Filippi, Rosaria', 'Severino, Valeria', 'Di Francia, Raffaele', 'Frigeri, Ferdinando', 'Mancuso, Pietro', 'De Chiara, Anna', 'Pinto, Antonio', 'Casola, Stefano', 'Simeone, Antonio']","['Omodei D', 'Acampora D', 'Russo F', 'De Filippi R', 'Severino V', 'Di Francia R', 'Frigeri F', 'Mancuso P', 'De Chiara A', 'Pinto A', 'Casola S', 'Simeone A']","['Centro di Ingegneria Genetica (CEINGE) Biotecnologie Avanzate, Naples, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091105,United States,Am J Pathol,The American journal of pathology,0370502,PMC2789631,2009/11/07 06:00,2010/02/26 06:00,['2009/11/07 06:00'],"['2009/11/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/26 06:00 [medline]']","['S0002-9440(10)60768-7 [pii]', '10.2353/ajpath.2009.090542 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Pathol. 2009 Dec;175(6):2609-17. doi: 10.2353/ajpath.2009.090542.

It has also been described that constitutively phosphorylated STAT5 (pSTAT5) plays a pro-oncogenic role in various myeloid neoplasms. We examined the expression of pSTAT5 in neoplastic mast cells in systemic mastocytosis and asked whether the disease-related oncoprotein KIT D816V is involved in STAT5 activation. As assessed by immunohistochemistry using the anti-pSTAT5 antibody AX1, neoplastic mast cells were found to display pSTAT5 in all SM patients examined (n = 40). Expression of pSTAT5 was also demonstrable in the KIT D816V-positive mast cell leukemia cell line HMC-1. Using various staining-protocols, pSTAT5 was found to be located in both the cytoplasmic and nuclear compartment of mast cells. To define the functional role of KIT D816V in STAT5-activation, Ba/F3 cells with doxycycline-inducible expression of KIT D816V were used. In these cells, induction of KIT D816V resulted in an increased expression of pSTAT5 without substantial increase in total STAT5. Moreover, the KIT D816V-targeting kinase-inhibitor PKC412 was found to counteract expression of pSTAT5 in HMC-1 cells as well as doxycycline-induced expression of pSTAT5 in Ba/F3 cells. Finally, a dominant negative STAT5-construct was found to inhibit growth of HMC-1 cells. Together, our data show that neoplastic mast cells express cytoplasmic and nuclear pSTAT5, that KIT D816V promotes STAT5-activation, and that STAT5-activation contributes to growth of neoplastic mast cells.","['Baumgartner, Christian', 'Cerny-Reiterer, Sabine', 'Sonneck, Karoline', 'Mayerhofer, Matthias', 'Gleixner, Karoline V', 'Fritz, Richard', 'Kerenyi, Marc', 'Boudot, Cedric', 'Gouilleux, Fabrice', 'Kornfeld, Jan-Wilhelm', 'Sillaber, Christian', 'Moriggl, Richard', 'Valent, Peter']","['Baumgartner C', 'Cerny-Reiterer S', 'Sonneck K', 'Mayerhofer M', 'Gleixner KV', 'Fritz R', 'Kerenyi M', 'Boudot C', 'Gouilleux F', 'Kornfeld JW', 'Sillaber C', 'Moriggl R', 'Valent P']","['Department of Internal Medicine I, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091105,United States,Am J Pathol,The American journal of pathology,0370502,PMC2789628,2009/11/07 06:00,2010/02/26 06:00,['2009/11/07 06:00'],"['2009/11/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/26 06:00 [medline]']","['S0002-9440(10)60751-1 [pii]', '10.2353/ajpath.2009.080953 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Pathol. 2009 Dec;175(6):2416-29. doi: 10.2353/ajpath.2009.080953.

METHODS: We analyzed survey data from 623 survivors diagnosed with leukemia, colorectal, or bladder cancer in Northern California, 2-5 years prior to the study. Of these, 395 reported making a medical decision in the past 12 months and were asked about their physician's decision-making style. We evaluated the association of physician style with proximal communication outcomes (trust and participation self-efficacy), intermediate cognitive outcomes (perceived control and uncertainty), and distal health outcomes (physical and mental HRQOL). RESULTS: Overall, 54% of survivors reported a sub-optimal decision-making style for their physician. With the exception of physical health, physician style was associated with all proximal, intermediate, and distal outcomes (p< or =0.01). We identified two significant pathways by which a participatory physician style may be associated with survivors' mental health: (1) by increasing survivors' participation self-efficacy and thereby enhancing their perceptions of personal control (p<0.01); (2) by enhancing survivors' level of trust and thereby reducing their perceptions of uncertainty (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: A participatory physician style may improve survivors' mental health by a complex two-step mechanism of improving survivors' proximal communication and intermediate cognitive outcomes. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Physicians who adopt a participatory decision-making style are likely to facilitate patient empowerment and enhance patients' HRQOL.","['Arora, Neeraj K', 'Weaver, Kathryn E', 'Clayman, Marla L', 'Oakley-Girvan, Ingrid', 'Potosky, Arnold L']","['Arora NK', 'Weaver KE', 'Clayman ML', 'Oakley-Girvan I', 'Potosky AL']","['Outcomes Research Branch, Applied Research Program, Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences, National Cancer Institute, 6130 Executive Blvd, MSC 7344, EPN 4092, Bethesda, MD 20892-7344, USA. aroran@mail.nih.gov']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20091104,Ireland,Patient Educ Couns,Patient education and counseling,8406280,PMC3401045,2009/11/07 06:00,2011/01/14 06:00,['2009/11/07 06:00'],"['2009/09/26 00:00 [received]', '2009/10/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/11/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/14 06:00 [medline]']","['S0738-3991(09)00463-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.pec.2009.10.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Patient Educ Couns. 2009 Dec;77(3):404-12. doi: 10.1016/j.pec.2009.10.004.

METHODS: We treated 5 patients with chemotherapy-refractory AML with the mTOR-inhibitor rapamycin at 2mg per os daily for 14 days, with dose adjustment allowed to reach a target serum rapamycin concentration of 10-20 ng/mL. Four of five patients received additional hydroxyurea at constant dose during treatment with rapamycin. RESULTS: Two patients achieved a leukocyte response, in one of them, a prolonged response was seen. In the other patients, blast counts remained stable or increased during rapamycin therapy. We did not observe severe hematologic or non-hematologic side effects of rapamycin. CONCLUSION: Rapamycin at 2mg per day acts mildly cytoreductive in a subgroup of patients with refractory AML. Higher doses and drug combinations may be required to obtain long lasting anti-leukemic effects in these patients.","['Boehm, Alexandra', 'Mayerhofer, Matthias', 'Herndlhofer, Susanne', 'Knoebl, Paul', 'Sillaber, Christian', 'Sperr, Wolfgang R', 'Jaeger, Ulrich', 'Valent, Peter']","['Boehm A', 'Mayerhofer M', 'Herndlhofer S', 'Knoebl P', 'Sillaber C', 'Sperr WR', 'Jaeger U', 'Valent P']","['Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology & Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",20091007,Netherlands,Eur J Intern Med,European journal of internal medicine,9003220,,2009/11/07 06:00,2010/11/03 06:00,['2009/11/07 06:00'],"['2009/07/14 00:00 [received]', '2009/09/06 00:00 [revised]', '2009/09/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/11/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/11/03 06:00 [medline]']","['S0953-6205(09)00184-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ejim.2009.09.007 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Intern Med. 2009 Dec;20(8):775-8. doi: 10.1016/j.ejim.2009.09.007.

A high HTLV-1 proviral load in circulating lymphocytes of HTLV-1 carriers is a risk factor for HTLV-1-related diseases. The virus-cell interaction is linked to viral tropism and pathogenesis. Characterization of the factors that affect HTLV-1 infection is important for preventing HTLV-1 infection. HTLV-1 virions are believed to be weakly infectious under cell culture conditions; however, we found that the treatment of HTLV-1 virions with microbial neuraminidase, an enzyme catalyzing the removal of sialic acid residues from various glycoconjugates, enhanced the number of proviral DNAs in infected cells in a dose-dependent manner. Neuraminidase treatment of virions, but not target cells, enhanced viral binding and entry into cells and viral infectivity; treatment of target cells prior to infection had no effect. Moreover, the number of HTLV-1-mediated syncytia was higher in the presence of neuraminidase. Our results suggest a possible contribution of microbial agents carrying neuraminidase activity to HTLV-1 pathogenesis.","['Tanaka, Masakazu', 'Sun, Binlian', 'Tezuka, Kenta', 'Fujisawa, Jun-Ichi', 'Tanaka, Yuetsu', 'Hoshino, Hiroo', 'Miwa, Masanao']","['Tanaka M', 'Sun B', 'Tezuka K', 'Fujisawa J', 'Tanaka Y', 'Hoshino H', 'Miwa M']","['Graduate School of Bioscience, Nagahama Institute of Bio-Science and Technology, Nagahama, Shiga 526-0829, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091103,France,Microbes Infect,Microbes and infection,100883508,,2009/11/07 06:00,2010/04/28 06:00,['2009/11/07 06:00'],"['2009/09/08 00:00 [received]', '2009/10/10 00:00 [revised]', '2009/10/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/11/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/28 06:00 [medline]']","['S1286-4579(09)00236-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.micinf.2009.10.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Microbes Infect. 2010 Feb;12(2):119-25. doi: 10.1016/j.micinf.2009.10.003.

We have analyzed 138 diagnosis and follow-up samples from 13 RUNX1-RUNX1T1+ patients as well as diagnosis samples from 13 RUNX1-RUNX1T1- AML patients and 26 healthy donors. Levels of native RUNX1T1 mRNA were low in both healthy and RUNX1-RUNX1T1-negative AML samples. Likewise, the ratio between RUNX1T1 mRNA harboring exon 9a and lacking exon 9a was low and tightly regulated (0.017-0.11). In contrast, 11/13 RUNX1-RUNX1T1-positive AML patients displayed high and variable ratios of FT ranging from 0.05 to 0.46 (P < 0.001, Wilcoxon rank-sum test), indicating altered exon 9a splicing in these patients. Importantly, patients who remained in continuous complete remission displayed a faster disappearance of the RUNX1-RUNX1T1 exon 9a splice variant compared to patients bound to relapse (P = 0.02). In conclusion, alternative splicing seems to be part of the leukemogenic process in the majority of RUNX1-RUNX1T1-positive AML patients, and splice variant kinetics under cytoreduction may be a predictor for patients prone to relapse.","['Ommen, Hans B', 'Ostergaard, Mette', 'Yan, Ming', 'Braendstrup, Karin', 'Zhang, Dong-Er', 'Hokland, Peter']","['Ommen HB', 'Ostergaard M', 'Yan M', 'Braendstrup K', 'Zhang DE', 'Hokland P']","['Laboratory of Immunohematology, Department of Hematology, Aarhus University Hospital, Arhus, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091105,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,,2009/11/07 06:00,2010/02/26 06:00,['2009/11/07 06:00'],"['2009/11/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/26 06:00 [medline]']","['EJH1371 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-0609.2009.01371.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2010 Feb 1;84(2):128-32. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2009.01371.x.

The classification of AML allows identification of subgroups with favorable prognosis. However, besides these specific subgroups, most patients will have an intermediate or unfavorable prognosis often resulting in induction failure, probably due to drug resistance of the leukemic blasts, and more frequently resulting in early relapse after achieving complete remission. This unfavorable situation leads to a strong need to develop new diagnostic and therapeutic options. However, development of these therapies and their efficient use requires a better understanding of the biology and the molecular pathogenesis of AML. Pharmacogenomics focuses on the genetic variation of drug-metabolizing enzymes, targets and transporters, and how these genetic variations interact to produce specific drug-related phenotypes. Potential genetic markers may serve to functionally subclassify patients by their disease and therefore influence the nature and intensity of treatment.

ES cells maintain pluripotency through a complex interplay of different signaling pathways and transcription factors, including leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), Nanog, Sox2, and Oct3/4. Nanog, however, plays a key role in maintaining the pluripotency of mouse and human ES cells. Phosphoinositde 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling pathway which is activated in response to growth factors and cytokines also plays a critical role in promoting the survival and proliferation of ES cells. Our earlier studies revealed that retinol, the alcohol form of vitamin A, enhances the expression of Nanog and prevents differentiation of ES cells in long-term cultures. Normally vitamin A/retinol is associated with cell differentiation via its potent metabolite, retinoic acid. Thus far, no direct function has been ascribed to retinol itself. In this study, we demonstrate for the first time that retinol directly activates phosphoinositide three (PI3) kinase signaling pathway through IGF-1 receptor/insulin receptor substrate one (IRS-1) by engaging Akt/PKB-mTORC1 mammalian target of rapamycin-2 (mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2), indicating a growth factor-like function of vitamin A. Furthermore, ES cells do not express enzymes to metabolize retinol into retinoic acid and lack receptors for retinol transport into the cytoplasm, indicating that retinol signaling is independent of retinoic acid. This study presents a novel system to investigate how extracellular signals control the self renewal of ES cells which will be important for high-quality ES cells for regenerative medicine.","['Chen, Liguo', 'Khillan, Jaspal S']","['Chen L', 'Khillan JS']","['Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15261, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Stem Cells,"Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)",9304532,,2009/11/06 06:00,2010/03/02 06:00,['2009/11/06 06:00'],"['2009/11/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/stem.251 [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cells. 2010 Jan;28(1):57-63. doi: 10.1002/stem.251.,1,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/*drug effects/enzymology', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Homeodomain Proteins/metabolism', 'Insulin Receptor Substrate Proteins/metabolism', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Nanog Homeobox Protein', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*metabolism', 'Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Phosphorylation', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells/*drug effects/enzymology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Receptor, IGF Type 1/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinases, 70-kDa/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Time Factors', 'Tretinoin/metabolism', 'Vitamin A/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'ras Proteins/metabolism']",,"['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Insulin Receptor Substrate Proteins)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Irs1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Nanog Homeobox Protein)', '0 (Nanog protein, mouse)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '11103-57-4 (Vitamin A)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (mTOR protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, IGF Type 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinases, 70-kDa)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ras Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A single center experience.,374-8,10.1055/s-0029-1239533 [doi],"BACKGROUND: The risk of severe complications or death during the initial period of acute leukemia was markedly decreased due to the progress in pediatric oncology and use of simple measures like hyperhydration, forced diuresis, treatment of hyperuricemia, correction of electrolyte and coagulation disturbances and the careful use of antileukemic drugs. The incidence of leukostasis and tumor lysis syndrome depends on absolute initial white blood cell counts and the underlying type of leukemia. Leukapheresis or exchange transfusion may improve the prognosis of high risk patients. METHODS: Records of all pediatric patients who were newly diagnosed with acute leukemia between 1 / 1998 und 12 / 2008 were retrospectively reviewed for presence of hyperleukocytosis(white blood cell count > 100 GPT / l) at diagnosis and subsequent leukapheresis or exchange transfusion in regards to the clinical outcome. RESULTS: At diagnosis 11 (14 % ) of 77 children with acute leukemia (7 acute lymphoblastic leukemia / ALL; 4 acute myeloblastic leukemia /AML) had hyperleukocytosis. 4 patients (2 ALL, 2 AML) received exchange transfusion and 2 others (1 ALL, 1 AML) underwent leukapheresis. Marked cytoreduction was achieved in all patients within 24 h after therapy initiation. There were no procedure-related adverse events. Symptoms due to hyperleukocytosis markedly improved after cytoreduction. CONCLUSION: Leukapheresis or exchange transfusion together with conservative management and specific oncological therapy may contribute to rapid leukocyte reduction with acceptable risk. The exact impact of leukapheresis or exchange transfusion on short and long term outcome in pediatric patients with acute leukemia and initial hyperleukocytosis has to be evaluated in future multicentre studies or by the formation of clinical registries.","['Haase, R', 'Merkel, N', 'Diwan, O', 'Elsner, K', 'Kramm, C M']","['Haase R', 'Merkel N', 'Diwan O', 'Elsner K', 'Kramm CM']","['Klinik fur Kinder- und Jugendmedizin, Martin-Luther-Universitat Halle-Wittenberg, Halle/Saale, Germany. roland.haase@medizin.uni-halle.de']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20091104,Germany,Klin Padiatr,Klinische Padiatrie,0326144,,2009/11/06 06:00,2010/02/18 06:00,['2009/11/06 06:00'],"['2009/11/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1055/s-0029-1239533 [doi]'],ppublish,Klin Padiatr. 2009 Nov-Dec;221(6):374-8. doi: 10.1055/s-0029-1239533.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Medical history and clinical findings of 189 children and adolescents, diagnosed with ALL between 1/1995 and 7/2004, were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: Only 50% of patients presented with symptoms known in children with leukemia (fever, fatigue, paleness, hemorrhage); 5% were diagnosed accidentally in the absence of any clinical symptoms. The majority of patients had a medical history up to few weeks; in 11% of patients up to several months without impairing curability. 95% of the patients presented at diagnosis with enlargement of lymphnodes, liver and/or spleen. The characteristic laboratory constellation included mono-, respectively bi- or trilinear pathology of the blood count and with blasts in the blood smear. CONCLUSION: The clinical diagnosis of ALL relies on physical examination and the blood count including microscopic examination. Therefore, the alertness of the treating paediatrician with regard to clinical findings and a pathologic blood count is more important than elaborate laboratory investigations. In uncertain cases, a close follow-up examination may help to unmask ALL, which will most likely be stratified in the low-risk-group.","['Bernbeck, B', 'Wuller, D', 'Janssen, G', 'Wessalowski, R', 'Gobel, U', 'Schneider, D T']","['Bernbeck B', 'Wuller D', 'Janssen G', 'Wessalowski R', 'Gobel U', 'Schneider DT']","['Klinikum Dortmund, Westfalisches Kinderzentrum, Dortmund, Germany.

We present the interview study as if it had been an independent study. Parents of 471 cases with Leukaemia, Lymphoma or CNS (Central Nervous System)-tumour from the German Childhood Cancer Registry, diagnosed at age under 5 in the years 1993-2003, and 1,457 matched controls were to be interviewed. For Leukaemia, 243 cases/604 controls, and for CNS 102 cases/246 controls participated, lymphoma cases were too few. Questions related to social status, ionizing radiation, pregnancy and birth, immune system, and selected toxins. The analysis is exploratory in nature; variables were selected by backward elimination. For leukaemia we found a significant protective effect of social contacts (OR=0.50, 95% CI [0.29;0.87]) and a risk for high birth weight (OR=1.96 95% CI [1.12;3.41] comparing >4,000 g to ""normal""). We could not reproduce other associations reported in the literature such as a negative association with allergies. For CNS tumours we found a significant protective effect of social contacts (OR=0.30 95% CI [0.13;0.72]), of pesticides and herbicides (OR=0.39 95% CI [0.18;0.83]) and an increased risk for low birth weight (p=0.0232). This study on risk factors for childhood leukaemia and brain tumours is relatively small and exploratory. We could reproduce some major associations reported in the literature (leukaemia: social contacts and high birth weight) but not others. Some observations may be reporting artefacts or self selection artefacts.","['Spix, C', 'Schulze-Rath, R', 'Kaatsch, P', 'Blettner, M']","['Spix C', 'Schulze-Rath R', 'Kaatsch P', 'Blettner M']","['Universitatsmedizin Mainz, Deutsches Kinderkrebsregister, Mainz, Germany. kinderkrebsregister@imbei.uni-mainz.de']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20091104,Germany,Klin Padiatr,Klinische Padiatrie,0326144,,2009/11/06 06:00,2010/02/18 06:00,['2009/11/06 06:00'],"['2009/11/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1055/s-0029-1239531 [doi]'],ppublish,Klin Padiatr. 2009 Nov-Dec;221(6):362-8. doi: 10.1055/s-0029-1239531.

We prospectively evaluated the results of early SCT in pediatric CML after standardized pretreatment with hydroxyurea+/-interferon. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 1995 and 2004, 200 children (median age: 12.4 years) were enrolled and stratified: given the availability of an HLA-matched related donor (MRD), SCT was scheduled within 6 months and otherwise from an unrelated donor (UD) within 12 months following diagnosis. RESULTS: 176 patients underwent SCT; from MRD within median 4 months and from UD within median 11 months after diagnosis. At SCT, 158 patients were in chronic phase (CP1 or CP2), 9 patients were in accelerated phase and 9 patients were in blast crisis (BC). The conditioning regimen - total body irradiation or busulfan - exerted no different impact on overall survival (OS). Probability of OS at 5 years was 87+/-11% if grafted from a sibling (n=41), 52+/-9% from matched UD (MUD, n=71), and 45+/-16% from mismatched donors (MMD, n=55), respectively. A trend for better OS in CP1 was observed if SCT was performed within 6 months (n=49; 74+/-9%), compared to 7-12 months (n=52; 62+/-15%), and >12 months (n=43; 62+/-17%) after diagnosis, respectively (p=0.157). Probability of relapse at 5 years was 20+/-12%. Transplant-related mortality and graft-versus-host disease mainly contributed to the inferior outcome in UD and HLA-mismatched SCT. CONCLUSION: These data from the first prospective trial on CML restricted to children and adolescents might be considered for decision making when balancing the risks of SCT against the increasing use of imatinib as upfront treatment for CML.","['Suttorp, M', 'Claviez, A', 'Bader, P', 'Peters, C', 'Gadner, H', 'Ebell, W', 'Dilloo, D', 'Kremens, B', 'Kabisch, H', 'Fuhrer, M', 'Zintl, F', 'Gobel, U', 'Klingebiel, T']","['Suttorp M', 'Claviez A', 'Bader P', 'Peters C', 'Gadner H', 'Ebell W', 'Dilloo D', 'Kremens B', 'Kabisch H', 'Fuhrer M', 'Zintl F', 'Gobel U', 'Klingebiel T']","['Universitatskinderklinik Dresden, Germany. meinolf.suttorp@uniklinikum-dresden.de']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20091104,Germany,Klin Padiatr,Klinische Padiatrie,0326144,,2009/11/06 06:00,2010/02/18 06:00,['2009/11/06 06:00'],"['2009/11/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1055/s-0029-1239529 [doi]'],ppublish,Klin Padiatr. 2009 Nov-Dec;221(6):351-7. doi: 10.1055/s-0029-1239529.

In particular cell death research proved to be the key for the development of novel strategies for cancer therapy. In the past two decades, deregulated apoptosis in tumors has been delineated and possible targets for therapeutic intervention have been identified. However, it still took a long way until this work could be translated into clinical trials only in the past few years. Current strategies involve modification of apoptosis signalling based on our knowledge of sensitivity and resistance for apoptosis induction rather than the use of individual agents for cytotoxicity.

We evaluated the addition of compartmental intrathecal antibody-based radioimmunotherapy (cRIT) in patients with recurrent metastatic central nervous system (CNS) neuroblastoma following surgery, craniospinal irradiation, and chemotherapy. Twenty one patients treated for recurrent neuroblastoma metastatic to the CNS, received a cRIT-containing salvage regimen incorporating intrathecal (131)I-monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) targeting GD2 or B7H3 following surgery and radiation. Most patients also received outpatient craniospinal irradiation, 3F8/GMCSF immunotherapy, 13-cis-retinoic acid and oral temozolomide for systemic control. Seventeen of 21 cRIT-salvage patients are alive 7-74 months (median 33 months) since CNS relapse, with all 17 remaining free of CNS neuroblastoma. One patient died of infection at 22 months with no evidence of disease at autopsy, and one of lung and bone marrow metastases at 15 months, and one of progressive bone marrow disease at 30 months. The cRIT-salvage regimen was well tolerated, notable for myelosuppression minimized by stem cell support (n = 5), and biochemical hypothyroidism (n = 5). One patient with a 7-year history of metastatic neuroblastoma is in remission from MLL-associated secondary leukemia. This is significantly improved to published results with non-cRIT based where relapsed CNS NB has a median time to death of approximately 6 months.

CASE PRESENTATION AND FURTHER CLINICAL COURSE: A 30-year-old man who had been successfully treated for acute lymphatic T-cell leukemia (T-ALL) 18 years earlier developed multiple osteolytic lesions with compression fractures in the cervical spine, accompanied by an elevated serum concentration of C-reactive protein (CRP). One of the foci was biopsied, and the histological findings were interpreted as showing recurrent T-ALL. Induction chemotherapy was performed; this was followed by progressive osteolysis, abscesses, and visual disturbances due to an intracerebral infectious granuloma. High-dose chemotherapy was then planned, but the patient refused to undergo it. Further biopsies of the cranium and iliac crest revealed sterile abscesses. The newly proposed diagnosis was chronic, recurrent multilocular osteomyelitis (CRMO), for which treatment was begun with prednisolone and indomethacin. A fall in the CRP concentration and transient symptomatic improvement resulted. Two months later, however, the patient developed an intra-abdominal abscess. After this was surgically drained, mycobacteria were demonstrated for the first time, finally enabling a correct diagnosis. The patient underwent tuberculostatic treatment with 4 different drugs for 2 years. His CRP became normal, and all of the abscesses and other symptoms resolved completely. CONCLUSIONS: A T-ALL recurrence confined to bone would have been an extremely rare event, and this putative diagnosis should have been critically questioned. The high-dose chemotherapy that was proposed would have been life-threatening for a patient with florid tuberculosis. Inflammatory responses in bone can mimic the histological appearance of CRMO. The staining method can be problematic for the microbiological demonstration of tuberculosis. In this case, the causative organism was finally demonstrated with an auramine stain and fluorescence microscopy.","['Herzog, Alexander']",['Herzog A'],"['Klinik fur Integrative Onkologie, Nidda/Bad Salzhausen.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20090904,Germany,Dtsch Arztebl Int,Deutsches Arzteblatt international,101475967,PMC2770211,2009/11/06 06:00,2010/01/14 06:00,['2009/11/06 06:00'],"['2009/05/14 00:00 [received]', '2009/07/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/11/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3238/arztebl.2009.0573 [doi]'],ppublish,Dtsch Arztebl Int. 2009 Sep;106(36):573-7. doi: 10.3238/arztebl.2009.0573.

High-dose cytarabine is used as the standard consolidation chemotherapy. Oncogenic RAS mutations are frequently observed in AML, and are associated with beneficial response to cytarabine. Why AML-patients with oncogenic RAS benefit most from high-dose cytarabine post-remission therapy is not well understood. Here we used bone marrow cells expressing a conditional MLL-ENL-ER oncogene to investigate the interaction of oncogenic RAS and chemotherapeutic agents. We show that oncogenic RAS synergizes with cytotoxic agents such as cytarabine in activation of DNA damage checkpoints, resulting in a p53-dependent genetic program that reduces clonogenicity and increases myeloid differentiation. Our data can explain the beneficial effects observed for AML patients with oncogenic RAS treated with higher dosages of cytarabine and suggest that induction of p53-dependent differentiation, e.g. by interfering with Mdm2-mediated degradation, may be a rational approach to increase cure rate in response to chemotherapy. The data also support the notion that the therapeutic success of cytotoxic drugs may depend on their ability to promote the differentiation of tumor-initiating cells.","['Meyer, Mona', 'Rubsamen, Daniela', 'Slany, Robert', 'Illmer, Thomas', 'Stabla, Kathleen', 'Roth, Petra', 'Stiewe, Thorsten', 'Eilers, Martin', 'Neubauer, Andreas']","['Meyer M', 'Rubsamen D', 'Slany R', 'Illmer T', 'Stabla K', 'Roth P', 'Stiewe T', 'Eilers M', 'Neubauer A']","['Klinik fur Hamatologie, Onkologie und Immunologie, Philipps Universitat Marburg, Marburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091105,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,PMC2767509,2009/11/06 06:00,2010/04/27 06:00,['2009/11/06 06:00'],"['2009/04/26 00:00 [received]', '2009/10/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/11/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1371/journal.pone.0007768 [doi]'],epublish,PLoS One. 2009 Nov 5;4(11):e7768. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0007768.,11,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cellular Senescence', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology', 'Daunorubicin/pharmacology', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', '*Genes, ras', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Mutation', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*metabolism', 'ras Proteins/*genetics']",,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ras Proteins)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Their anti-apoptotic activities are determined by intracellular localization and post-translational modifications (such as phosphorylation). Here, we showed that WAVE1, a member of the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein family, was over-expressed in blood cancer cell lines, and functioned as a negative regulator of apoptosis. Further enhanced expression of WAVE1 by gene transfection rendered leukemia cells more resistant to anti-cancer drug-induced apoptosis; whereas suppression of WAVE1 expression by RNA interference restored leukemia cells' sensitivity to anti-drug-induced apoptosis. WAVE1 was found to be associated with mitochondrial Bcl-2, and its depletion led to mitochondrial release of Bcl-2, and phosphorylation of ASK1/JNK and Bcl-2. Furthermore, depletion of WAVE1 expression increased anti-cancer drug-induced production of reactive oxygen species in leukemia cells. Taken together, these results suggest WAVE1 as a novel regulator of apoptosis, and potential drug target for therapeutic intervention of leukemia.","['Kang, R', 'Tang, D', 'Yu, Y', 'Wang, Z', 'Hu, T', 'Wang, H', 'Cao, L']","['Kang R', 'Tang D', 'Yu Y', 'Wang Z', 'Hu T', 'Wang H', 'Cao L']","[""Department of Pediatrics, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan 410008, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091105,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,PMC2866426,2009/11/06 06:00,2010/01/28 06:00,['2009/11/06 06:00'],"['2009/11/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/28 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2009224 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2009.224 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2010 Jan;24(1):177-86. doi: 10.1038/leu.2009.224.

This resistance is often caused by point mutations in the ABL kinase domain or by overexpression of LYN. The second-generation BCR-ABL inhibitor INNO-406 is known to inhibit most BCR-ABL mutants and LYN efficiently. Knowledge of its full target spectrum would provide the molecular basis for potential side effects or suggest novel therapeutic applications and possible combination therapies. We have performed an unbiased chemical proteomics native target profile of INNO-406 in CML cells combined with functional assays using 272 recombinant kinases thereby identifying several new INNO-406 targets. These include the kinases ZAK, DDR1/2 and various ephrin receptors. The oxidoreductase NQO2, inhibited by both imatinib and nilotinib, is not a relevant target of INNO-406. Overall, INNO-406 has an improved activity over imatinib but a slightly broader target profile than both imatinib and nilotinib. In contrast to dasatinib and bosutinib, INNO-406 does not inhibit all SRC kinases and most TEC family kinases and is therefore expected to elicit fewer side effects. Altogether, these properties may make INNO-406 a valuable component in the drug arsenal against CML.","['Rix, U', 'Remsing Rix, L L', 'Terker, A S', 'Fernbach, N V', 'Hantschel, O', 'Planyavsky, M', 'Breitwieser, F P', 'Herrmann, H', 'Colinge, J', 'Bennett, K L', 'Augustin, M', 'Till, J H', 'Heinrich, M C', 'Valent, P', 'Superti-Furga, G']","['Rix U', 'Remsing Rix LL', 'Terker AS', 'Fernbach NV', 'Hantschel O', 'Planyavsky M', 'Breitwieser FP', 'Herrmann H', 'Colinge J', 'Bennett KL', 'Augustin M', 'Till JH', 'Heinrich MC', 'Valent P', 'Superti-Furga G']","['CeMM - Center for Molecular Medicine of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, Vienna 1090, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091105,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,2009/11/06 06:00,2010/01/28 06:00,['2009/11/06 06:00'],"['2009/11/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/28 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2009228 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2009.228 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2010 Jan;24(1):44-50. doi: 10.1038/leu.2009.228.

We previously found that proteasome inhibition by bortezomib failed to sensitize anti-CD30 antibody (Ab)-based lymphoma cell killing. In this study, we demonstrate in L540 Hodgkin's lymphoma cells that proteasome inhibition not only communicates apoptosis but also more rapidly causes a loss of CD30 antigen from cell membrane and a simultaneous release of soluble CD30, a targeting competitor. This shedding was catalyzed by the tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha-converting enzyme (TACE, ADAM17) and blocked by the ADAM17-selective inhibitor, Ro32-7315. In parallel with CD30 shedding, bortezomib caused the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). As apoptosis and shedding were inhibited by the radical scavenger, N-acetyl-L-cysteine, ROS might have a pivotal function in both effects. In contrast, the pan-caspase inhibitor, zVAD-fmk, blocked bortezomib-induced apoptosis but not CD30 shedding, and Ro32-7315 blocked shedding but allowed apoptosis. This suggests independent terminal signaling pathways that are conflicting in Ab-based immunotherapy. Consequently, shedding inhibition substantially improved the synergistic antitumor efficacy of the human anti-CD30 Ab, MDX-060, and bortezomib.

We hypothesized that increased expression of miRNAs encoded on chromosome 21 (chr 21) contribute to the leukemogenic function of trisomy 21. The levels of chr 21 miRNAs were quantified by qRT-PCR in four types of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) characterized by either numerical (trisomy or tetrasomy) or structural abnormalities of chr 21. Suprisingly, high expression of the hsa-mir-125b-2 cluster, consisting of three miRNAs, was identified in leukemias with the structural ETV6/RUNX1 abnormality and not in ALLs with trisomy 21. Manipulation of ETV6/RUNX1 expression and chromatin immunoprecipitation studies showed that the high expression of the miRNA cluster is an event independent of the ETV6/RUNX1 fusion protein. Overexpression of hsa-mir-125b-2 conferred a survival advantage to Ba/F3 cells after IL-3 withdrawal or a broad spectrum of apoptotic stimuli through inhibition of caspase 3 activation. Conversely, knockdown of the endogenous miR-125b in the ETV6/RUNX1 leukemia cell line REH increased apoptosis after Doxorubicin and Staurosporine treatments. P53 protein levels were not altered by miR-125b.

Loss of heterozygosity was further found in this patient at 2 polymorphic sites in the 5' promoter region and in 2 intronic sites flanking exon 4, thus suggesting loss of heterozygosity covering at least 40 kb of the PU.1 locus.

However, emerging data suggest that imatinib also targets cells of the skeleton, stimulating the retention and sequestration of calcium and phosphate to bone, leading to decreased circulating levels of these minerals. The aim of this review is to highlight our current understanding of the mechanisms surrounding the effects of imatinib on the skeleton. In particular, it examines recent studies suggesting that imatinib has direct effects on bone-resorbing osteoclasts and bone-forming osteoblasts through inhibition of c-fms, c-kit, carbonic anhydrase II, and the platelet-derived growth factor receptor.

Viral maturation involves large-scale morphological changes in viral proteins and in genomic RNA dimer structures to yield infectious virions. Structural studies have largely focused on simplified in vitro models of genomic RNA dimers even though the relationship between these models and authentic viral RNA is unknown. We evaluate the secondary structure of the minimal dimerization domain in genomes isolated from Moloney murine leukemia virions using a quantitative and single nucleotide resolution RNA structure analysis technology (selective 2'-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension, or SHAPE). Results are consistent with an architecture in which the RNA dimer is stabilized by four primary interactions involving two sets of intermolecular base pairs and two loop-loop interactions. The dimerization domain can independently direct its own folding since heating and refolding reproduce the same structure as visualized in genomic RNA isolated from virions. Authentic ex virio RNA has a SHAPE reactivity profile similar to that of a simplified transcript dimer generated in vitro, with the important exception of a region that appears to form a compact stem-loop only in the virion-isolated RNA. Finally, we analyze the conformational changes that accompany folding of monomers into dimers in vitro. These experiments support well-defined structural models for an authentic dimerization domain and also emphasize that many features of mature genomic RNA dimers can be reproduced in vitro using properly designed, simplified RNAs.","['Gherghe, Cristina', 'Leonard, Christopher W', 'Gorelick, Robert J', 'Weeks, Kevin M']","['Gherghe C', 'Leonard CW', 'Gorelick RJ', 'Weeks KM']","['Department of Chemistry, University of North Carolina, A008 Kenan Labs, CB-3290, Chapel Hill, NC 27599-3290, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20091104,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,PMC2798349,2009/11/06 06:00,2010/01/13 06:00,['2009/11/06 06:00'],"['2009/11/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/13 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.01602-09 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.01602-09 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2010 Jan;84(2):898-906. doi: 10.1128/JVI.01602-09.

HTLV-1-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) play an important role in suppressing proliferation of HTLV-1-infected or transformed T-cells in vitro. Efficient induction of antigen-specific CTLs is important for immunologic suppression of oncogenesis, but has evaded strategies utilizing poorly immunogenic free synthetic peptides. In the present study, we examined the efficient induction of HTLV-1-specific CD8+ T-cell response by an HTLV-1/hepatitis B virus core (HBc) chimeric particle incorporating the HLA-A*0201-restricted HTLV-1 Tax-epitope. The immunization of HLA-A*0201-transgenic mice with the chimeric particle induced antigen-specific gamma-interferon reaction, whereas immunization with epitope peptide only induced no reaction as assessed by enzyme-linked immunospot assay. Immunization with the chimeric particle also induced HTLV-1-specific CD8+ T-cells in spleen and inguinal lymph nodes. Furthermore, upon exposure of dendritic cells from HLA-A*0201-transgenic mice to the chimeric particle, the expression of CD86, HLA-A02, TLR4 and MHC class II was increased. Additionally, our results show that HTLV-1-specific CD8+ T-cells can be induced by peptide with HTLV-1/HBc particle from ATL patient, but not by peptide only and these HTLV-1-specific CD8+ T-cells were able to lyse cells presenting the peptide. These results suggest that HTLV-1/HBc chimeric particle is capable of inducing strong cellular immune responses without adjuvants via effective maturation of dendritic cells and is potentially useful as an effective carrier for therapeutic vaccines in tumors, or in infectious diseases by substituting the epitope peptide.","['Kozako, Tomohiro', 'Fukada, Katsuhiko', 'Hirata, Shinya', 'White, Yohann', 'Harao, Michiko', 'Nishimura, Yasuharu', 'Kino, Youichiro', 'Soeda, Shinji', 'Shimeno, Hiroshi', 'Lemonnier, Francois', 'Sonoda, Shunro', 'Arima, Naomichi']","['Kozako T', 'Fukada K', 'Hirata S', 'White Y', 'Harao M', 'Nishimura Y', 'Kino Y', 'Soeda S', 'Shimeno H', 'Lemonnier F', 'Sonoda S', 'Arima N']","['Division of Hematology and Immunology, Center for Chronic Viral Diseases, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Kagoshima University, Kagoshima, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091103,England,Mol Immunol,Molecular immunology,7905289,,2009/11/06 06:00,2009/12/17 06:00,['2009/11/06 06:00'],"['2009/06/25 00:00 [received]', '2009/09/01 00:00 [revised]', '2009/09/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/11/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/17 06:00 [medline]']","['S0161-5890(09)00708-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.molimm.2009.09.006 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Immunol. 2009 Dec;47(2-3):606-13. doi: 10.1016/j.molimm.2009.09.006.

The IGHV3-21 subgroup displayed high TCL1 mRNA expression, differing significantly from other IGHV mutated cases (P < 0.001), although 11/19 had mutated IGHV genes. Furthermore, high TCL1 expression levels were associated with significantly shorter overall survival (P < 0.001). Altogether, we show that TCL1 mRNA expression may predict clinical outcome in CLL and that the IGHV3-21 subset, regardless of mutational status, displays high TCL1 expression.","['Mansouri, Mahmoud R', 'Sevov, Marie', 'Aleskog, Anna', 'Jondal, Mikael', 'Merup, Mats', 'Sundstrom, Christer', 'Osorio, Lyda', 'Rosenquist, Richard']","['Mansouri MR', 'Sevov M', 'Aleskog A', 'Jondal M', 'Merup M', 'Sundstrom C', 'Osorio L', 'Rosenquist R']","['Dept of Genetics and Pathology, Rudbeck Laboratory, Uppsala University, SE-751 85 Uppsala, Sweden. mahmoud.mansouri@genpat.uu.se']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091103,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,,2009/11/06 06:00,2010/02/26 06:00,['2009/11/06 06:00'],"['2009/11/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/26 06:00 [medline]']","['EJH1369 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-0609.2009.01369.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2010 Feb 1;84(2):109-16. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2009.01369.x.

This study aims to investigate the various cellular and molecular mechanisms of adverse cardiac effects and the electrophysi-ological alterations caused by As2O3. We show the dose-dependent effect of ATO (0.2, 0.4, 0.8, 1.6, 3.2, 6.4 mum) on electrically driven cardiac action potential from the papillary muscle of the guinea pig. ATO causes a significant prolongation of action potential duration (APD) at various levels of repolarization, conduction delay, and increased triangulation, which is a novel marker for the proarrhythmic potential of a compound. Electrolyte imbalance (hypomagnesemia and hypokalemia) has also been found to cause amplification of ATO toxicity. Since ion channels play a very important role in the generation of cardiac action potential, we used various ion channel modulators such as choline, minoxidil, nifedipine, and verapamil to determine whether these agents could antagonize electrophysiological alterations caused by ATO. In in vivo experiments, ATO administration to animals for 10 days caused myocardial disorganization, interstitial edema and infiltration of inflammatory cells in the heart. Efforts were also made to screen the efficacy of vitamin C against ATO toxicity. ATO also caused a significant increase in the activity of certain clinically relevant enzymes for cardiac function and antioxidant mechanismssuch as serum creatine kinase isoenzyme, lactate dehydrogenase, glutathione peroxidase and reduced glutathione. In conclusion, ATO causes significant adverse cardiac effects and we suggest that cardiac function to be monitored during treatment with ATO. Our results also indicate that the status of the body's main electrolyte content (such as magnesium and potassium) is also an influencing factor on the magnitude of toxicity of arsenic trioxide.","['Raghu, K G', 'Yadav, Govind Kumar', 'Singh, Richa', 'Prathapan, A', 'Sharma, Sharad', 'Bhadauria, Smrati']","['Raghu KG', 'Yadav GK', 'Singh R', 'Prathapan A', 'Sharma S', 'Bhadauria S']","['Pharmacology Division,Central Drug Research Institute, Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, India. raghukgopal@rediffmail.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,J Environ Pathol Toxicol Oncol,"Journal of environmental pathology, toxicology and oncology : official organ of the International Society for Environmental Toxicology and Cancer",8501420,,2009/11/06 06:00,2009/11/18 06:00,['2009/11/06 06:00'],"['2009/11/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/11/18 06:00 [medline]']","['019e22cb279c7547,64e3d7f92c152a8c [pii]', '10.1615/jenvironpatholtoxicoloncol.v28.i3.60 [doi]']",ppublish,J Environ Pathol Toxicol Oncol. 2009;28(3):241-52. doi: 10.1615/jenvironpatholtoxicoloncol.v28.i3.60.,3,IM,"['Action Potentials/drug effects', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*toxicity', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals', 'Ascorbic Acid/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Antagonism', 'Edema, Cardiac/chemically induced/physiopathology', 'Guinea Pigs', 'Heart/*drug effects/physiopathology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Membrane Transport Modulators/pharmacology', 'Myocardium/metabolism/pathology', 'Oxidants/pharmacology', 'Oxides/*toxicity', 'Oxidoreductases/metabolism', 'Vasodilator Agents/pharmacology']",,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Membrane Transport Modulators)', '0 (Oxidants)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Vasodilator Agents)', 'EC 1.- (Oxidoreductases)', 'PQ6CK8PD0R (Ascorbic Acid)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One hypothesis is that the shear stress caused by massage may induce cutaneous mast cells to release histamine, thereby improving the local tissue microcirculation of blood. In the present work, a mast cell line (rat basophilic leukemia cells, RBL-2H3) was used in vitro to study cellular responses to the stimulus of shear stress generated by a rotating rotor in a cell dish. The intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]c) was studied by confocal fluorescence microscopy with Fluo-3/AM staining and the released histamine was measured with a fluorescence spectrometer using o-phthalaldehyde (OPA) staining. An elevation of [Ca2+]c occurred immediately after the shear stress, followed by histamine release. However, both [Ca2+]c increase and histamine release disappeared when a Ca2+-free saline was used, indicating that the rise in the [Ca2+]c is due to a Ca2+ influx from the extracellular buffer. Furthermore, Ruthenium red, a transient receptor potential vanilloid (TRPV) inhibitor, could effectively block the shear stressinduced histamine release, suggesting that TRPV membrane proteins are the likely targets of the shear stress. Because histamine is a well-known mediator of microvascular tissue dilation, these results may have an important impact on understanding the mechanism involved in massage therapy.","['Yang, Wenzhong', 'Chen, Jiyao', 'Zhou, Luwei']","['Yang W', 'Chen J', 'Zhou L']","['Surface Physics Laboratory (National Key Laboratory), Department of Physics, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Environ Pathol Toxicol Oncol,"Journal of environmental pathology, toxicology and oncology : official organ of the International Society for Environmental Toxicology and Cancer",8501420,,2009/11/06 06:00,2009/11/18 06:00,['2009/11/06 06:00'],"['2009/11/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/11/18 06:00 [medline]']","['019e22cb279c7547,59138b5f2c152720 [pii]', '10.1615/jenvironpatholtoxicoloncol.v28.i3.30 [doi]']",ppublish,J Environ Pathol Toxicol Oncol. 2009;28(3):223-30. doi: 10.1615/jenvironpatholtoxicoloncol.v28.i3.30.,3,IM,"['Animals', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Calcium Channels/drug effects/physiology', 'Calcium Signaling/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Membrane/drug effects/metabolism', 'Histamine/*metabolism', 'Indicators and Reagents/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute', '*Massage', 'Mast Cells/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Mechanotransduction, Cellular/drug effects/*physiology', 'Microcirculation', 'Rats', 'Ruthenium Red/pharmacology', 'Stress, Mechanical', 'TRPV Cation Channels/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism']",,"['0 (Calcium Channels)', '0 (Indicators and Reagents)', '0 (TRPV Cation Channels)', '0 (Trpv4 protein, rat)', '11103-72-3 (Ruthenium Red)', '820484N8I3 (Histamine)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, for some diagnostic groups, little or no increases were observed. The aim of this study was to analyse the regional distribution of cancer survival in teenagers and young adults in England in order to identify patterns and potential for improvements at a regional scale. METHODS: We examined geographical and temporal patterns in relative survival in cancer patients aged 13-24 years in England during the time period 1979-2001. Cancer cases were grouped according to an internationally recognised morphology-based diagnostic scheme. RESULTS: For most diagnostic groups, there was little variation in survival between regions, except for testicular germ cell tumours (P=0.006) and colorectal carcinoma (P=0.002). For certain diagnostic groups, the temporal pattern in survival differed between regions. However, in regions that showed poor survival during the early part of the study period, greatest improvements were observed in groups such as acute lymphoid leukaemia, acute myeloid leukaemia, testicular tumours and melanoma. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, there was a reduction in the differences in survival between regions during the study period.","['Geraci, M', 'Eden, T O B', 'Alston, R D', 'Moran, A', 'Arora, R S', 'Birch, J M']","['Geraci M', 'Eden TO', 'Alston RD', 'Moran A', 'Arora RS', 'Birch JM']","['Cancer Research UK Paediatric and Familial Cancer Research Group, The Medical School, University of Manchester, Stopford Building, Oxford Road, Manchester M13 9PL, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091103,England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,PMC2788264,2009/11/06 06:00,2009/12/24 06:00,['2009/11/06 06:00'],"['2009/11/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/24 06:00 [medline]']","['6605410 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.bjc.6605410 [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 2009 Dec 1;101(11):1939-45. doi: 10.1038/sj.bjc.6605410.

We retrospectively analyzed outcomes of the second allo-SCT in 25 patients who received at least 2 allografts from related/unrelated donors due to relapse of acute myeloid leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome or myelofibrosis after the first SCT. A minority of the acute myeloid leukemia/myelodysplastic syndrome patients had reached complete hematological remission before the second SCT (6/25, 24%). Reduced conditioning strategies were performed in the majority (n = 23). Complete remission was achieved in all 21 cases with available data after the second SCT, but relapse was seen in 11/25 patients (44%). After a median follow-up of 18 months (range 6-47), 8/25 patients (32%) were still alive, and of those, 6 (24%) were in stable remission. In 9 cases mortality was associated to relapse and in 8 cases to transplant-related causes (treatment-related mortality; 8/25, 32%). In conclusion, a second SCT offers the chance of stable remission for some patients relapsing with a myeloid malignancy after a first allo-SCT, although high treatment-related mortality and relapse rates remain a problem. Efforts should concentrate on an optimization of conditioning strategies, immunosuppression and post-transplant surveillance for this specific situation.","['Hartwig, Maite', 'Ocheni, Sunday', 'Asenova, Svetlana', 'Wiedemann, Bettina', 'Zabelina, Tatjana', 'Ayuk, Francis', 'Kabisch, Hartmut', 'Erttmann, Rudolf', 'Kroger, Nicolaus', 'Zander, Axel Rolf', 'Bacher, Ulrike']","['Hartwig M', 'Ocheni S', 'Asenova S', 'Wiedemann B', 'Zabelina T', 'Ayuk F', 'Kabisch H', 'Erttmann R', 'Kroger N', 'Zander AR', 'Bacher U']","['Clinic for Stem Cell Transplantation, University Cancer Center Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20091029,Switzerland,Acta Haematol,Acta haematologica,0141053,,2009/11/06 06:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/11/06 06:00'],"['2009/07/02 00:00 [received]', '2009/07/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/11/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['000253025 [pii]', '10.1159/000253025 [doi]']",ppublish,Acta Haematol. 2009;122(4):185-92. doi: 10.1159/000253025.

In the unmutated subset (U-CLL), there is increased usage of the 51p1-related alleles of the immunoglobulin heavy chain variable 1-69 gene, often combined with selected genes and with immunoglobulin heavy chain diversity IGHJ6. Stereotypic characteristics of the HCDR3 result and suggest antigen selection of the leukemic clones. We have now analyzed 51p1/IGHJ6 combinations in normal blood B cells from 3 healthy persons for parallel sequence patterns. A high proportion (33.3% of sequences) revealed stereotypic patterns, with several (15.0%) being similar to those described in U-CLL. Previously unreported CLL-associated stereotypes were detected in 4.8%. Stereotypes (13.6%) not detected in CLL also were found. The HCDR2-IGHJ6 sequences were essentially unmutated. Junctional amino acids in normal B cells were heterogeneous, as in cases of stereotyped CLL. Phenotypically, normal B cells expressing 51p1-derived immunoglobulin M were naive. This snapshot of the naive B-cell repertoire reveals subsets of B cells closely related to those characteristic of CLL. Conserved patterns in the 51p1-encoded immunoglobulin M of normal B cells suggest a restricted sequence repertoire shaped by evolution to recognize common pathogens.

CLL cells are inherently resistant to tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL). Pretreatment with histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) sensitizes CLL cells to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis primarily via TRAIL-R1 and offers a novel approach for the therapy of CLL and other malignancies. Depsipeptide (romidepsin), a HDACi, did not enhance TRAIL binding to TRAIL-R1, TRAIL-R1 aggregation, or internalization of TRAIL-R1, but it enhanced Fas-associated death domain protein (FADD) recruitment to TRAIL-R1 in the death-inducing signaling complex. Cotreatment with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), a protein kinase C (PKC) activator, dramatically inhibited the HDACi-mediated increase in FADD recruitment and sensitization to TRAIL-induced apoptosis and both of these were reversed by PKC inhibitors. Thus, enhanced FADD recruitment is a critical step in HDACi-mediated sensitization of CLL cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis and this step is differentially affected by HDACi and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. Using biotinylated TRAIL and streptactin-tagged TRAIL, we have identified several novel TRAIL receptor interacting proteins, including PKCbeta, lymphocyte-specific protease-1, Lyn, and Syk. These molecules may play an as yet unappreciated role in TRAIL signaling in CLL cells and inhibition of one or more of these kinases/phosphatases may provide a novel target to overcome TRAIL resistance.","['Inoue, Satoshi', 'Harper, Nick', 'Walewska, Renata', 'Dyer, Martin J S', 'Cohen, Gerald M']","['Inoue S', 'Harper N', 'Walewska R', 'Dyer MJ', 'Cohen GM']","['MRC Toxicology Unit, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20091103,United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,,2009/11/06 06:00,2010/05/28 06:00,['2009/11/06 06:00'],"['2009/11/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/28 06:00 [medline]']","['1535-7163.MCT-09-0451 [pii]', '10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-09-0451 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2009 Nov;8(11):3088-97. doi: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-09-0451.

Among BH3-mimetic molecules constituting promising anticancer agents able to inhibit the activity of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins, we evaluated the effect of one of them, HA14-1, on various ovarian carcinoma cell lines. In response to HA14-1, the cisplatin-resistant IGROV1-R10 cell line underwent massive cell death, whereas other cell lines presented a partial response (IGROV1, SKOV3, and A2780) or did not respond to this molecule (OAW42 and OAW42-R). However, the expression of HA14-1 targets (Bcl-2 and Bcl-x(L)) did not correlate to these different responses. In contrast, cell death was associated with the disappearance of Mcl-1 after exposure to HA14-1. We showed that, in the HA14-1 nonresponsive cell lines (SKOV3 and OAW42), small interfering RNA-mediated Mcl-1 downregulation allowed HA14-1-induced massive apoptosis in the absence of chemotherapy. Furthermore, cisplatin-induced Mcl-1 downregulation was also able to sensitize highly chemoresistant SKOV3 cells to HA14-1. Taken together, these results show that Bcl-x(L) and Mcl-1 are able to cooperate to protect ovarian carcinoma cells against oncogenic stress or chemotherapy-induced apoptosis and suggest that the development of multitargeted strategies directed against these two antiapoptotic proteins may constitute a major challenge for the therapeutic care of chemoresistant ovarian carcinomas. BH3-mimetic compounds represent promising tools for this purpose either on their own (direct or indirect pan-inhibitors) or in combination with new drugs aiming to inactivate Mcl-1.","['Simonin, Karin', 'Brotin, Emilie', 'Dufort, Sandrine', 'Dutoit, Soizic', 'Goux, Didier', ""N'diaye, Monique"", 'Denoyelle, Christophe', 'Gauduchon, Pascal', 'Poulain, Laurent']","['Simonin K', 'Brotin E', 'Dufort S', 'Dutoit S', 'Goux D', ""N'diaye M"", 'Denoyelle C', 'Gauduchon P', 'Poulain L']","[""Groupe Regional d'Etudes sur le Cancer, Centre de Lutte contre le Cancer Francois Baclesse, Caen, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091103,United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,,2009/11/06 06:00,2010/05/28 06:00,['2009/11/06 06:00'],"['2009/11/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/28 06:00 [medline]']","['1535-7163.MCT-09-0493 [pii]', '10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-09-0493 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2009 Nov;8(11):3162-70. doi: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-09-0493.

Colony-stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1) is expressed by many tumors and is a growth factor for macrophages and mediates osteoclast differentiation. Herein, we report the efficacy of a novel orally active CSF-1 receptor (CSF-1R) kinase inhibitor, JNJ-28312141, in proof of concept studies of solid tumor growth and tumor-induced bone erosion. H460 lung adenocarcinoma cells did not express CSF-1R and were not growth inhibited by JNJ-28312141 in vitro. Nevertheless, daily p.o. administration of JNJ-28312141 caused dose-dependent suppression of H460 tumor growth in nude mice that correlated with marked reductions in F4/80(+) tumor-associated macrophages and with increased plasma CSF-1, a possible biomarker of CSF-1R inhibition. Furthermore, the tumor microvasculature was reduced in JNJ-28312141-treated mice, consistent with a role for macrophages in tumor angiogenesis. In separate studies, JNJ-28312141 was compared with zoledronate in a model in which MRMT-1 mammary carcinoma cells inoculated into the tibias of rats led to severe cortical and trabecular bone lesions. Both agents reduced tumor growth and preserved bone. However, JNJ-28312141 reduced the number of tumor-associated osteoclasts superior to zoledronate. JNJ-28312141 exhibited additional activity against FMS-related receptor tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3). To more fully define the therapeutic potential of this new agent, JNJ-28312141 was evaluated in a FLT3-dependent acute myeloid leukemia tumor xenograft model and caused tumor regression. In summary, this novel CSF-1R/FLT3 inhibitor represents a new agent with potential therapeutic activity in acute myeloid leukemia and in settings where CSF-1-dependent macrophages and osteoclasts contribute to tumor growth and skeletal events.","['Manthey, Carl L', 'Johnson, Dana L', 'Illig, Carl R', 'Tuman, Robert W', 'Zhou, Zhao', 'Baker, Judith F', 'Chaikin, Margery A', 'Donatelli, Robert R', 'Franks, Carol F', 'Zeng, Lee', 'Crysler, Carl', 'Chen, Yanmin', 'Yurkow, Edward J', 'Boczon, Lisa', 'Meegalla, Sanath K', 'Wilson, Kenneth J', 'Wall, Mark J', 'Chen, Jinsheng', 'Ballentine, Shelley K', 'Ott, Heidi', 'Baumann, Christian', 'Lawrence, Danielle', 'Tomczuk, Bruce E', 'Molloy, Christopher J']","['Manthey CL', 'Johnson DL', 'Illig CR', 'Tuman RW', 'Zhou Z', 'Baker JF', 'Chaikin MA', 'Donatelli RR', 'Franks CF', 'Zeng L', 'Crysler C', 'Chen Y', 'Yurkow EJ', 'Boczon L', 'Meegalla SK', 'Wilson KJ', 'Wall MJ', 'Chen J', 'Ballentine SK', 'Ott H', 'Baumann C', 'Lawrence D', 'Tomczuk BE', 'Molloy CJ']","['Johnson & Johnson Pharmaceutical Research & Development, Welsh and McKean Roads, Spring House, PA 19477, USA. cmanthey@its.jnj.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20091103,United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,,2009/11/06 06:00,2010/05/28 06:00,['2009/11/06 06:00'],"['2009/11/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/28 06:00 [medline]']","['1535-7163.MCT-09-0255 [pii]', '10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-09-0255 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2009 Nov;8(11):3151-61. doi: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-09-0255.

Surprisingly, the NC protein from human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is an extremely poor NA chaperone. Using bulk and single molecule methods, we find that removal of the anionic C-terminal domain (CTD) of HTLV-1 NC results in a protein with chaperone properties comparable with that of other retroviral NCs. Increasing the ionic strength of the solution also improves the chaperone activity of full-length HTLV-1 NC. To determine how the CTD negatively modulates the chaperone activity of HTLV-1 NC, we quantified the thermodynamics and kinetics of wild-type and mutant HTLV-1 NC/NA interactions. The wild-type protein exhibits very slow dissociation kinetics, and removal of the CTD or mutations that eliminate acidic residues dramatically increase the protein/DNA interaction kinetics. Taken together, these results suggest that the anionic CTD interacts with the cationic N-terminal domain intramolecularly when HTLV-1 NC is not bound to nucleic acids, and similar interactions occur between neighboring molecules when NC is NA-bound. The intramolecular N-terminal domain-CTD attraction slows down the association of the HTLV-1 NC with NA, whereas the intermolecular interaction leads to multimerization of HTLV-1 NC on the NA. The latter inhibits both NA/NC aggregation and rapid protein dissociation from single-stranded DNA. These features make HTLV-1 NC a poor NA chaperone, despite its robust duplex destabilizing capability.","['Qualley, Dominic F', 'Stewart-Maynard, Kristen M', 'Wang, Fei', 'Mitra, Mithun', 'Gorelick, Robert J', 'Rouzina, Ioulia', 'Williams, Mark C', 'Musier-Forsyth, Karin']","['Qualley DF', 'Stewart-Maynard KM', 'Wang F', 'Mitra M', 'Gorelick RJ', 'Rouzina I', 'Williams MC', 'Musier-Forsyth K']","['Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Center for Retrovirus Research, Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio 43210, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20091103,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,PMC2804176,2009/11/06 06:00,2010/01/27 06:00,['2009/11/06 06:00'],"['2009/11/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/27 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)66116-6 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M109.051334 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2010 Jan 1;285(1):295-307. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M109.051334.

This study demonstrated that protection in short term apoptosis assays and long term proliferation assays was maximal when Jurkat or HL-60 human leukemia cells were treated with 2-5 nm PMA. Immunoblotting demonstrated that multiple PKC isoforms, including PKCalpha, PKCbeta, PKCepsilon, and PKC, translocated from the cytosol to a membrane-bound fraction at these PMA concentrations. When the ability of short hairpin RNA (shRNA) constructs that specifically down-regulated each of these isoforms was examined, PKCbeta shRNA uniquely reversed PMA-induced protection against cell death. The PKCbeta-selective small molecule inhibitor enzastaurin had a similar effect. Although mass spectrometry suggested that Fas is phosphorylated on a number of serines and threonines, mutation of these sites individually or collectively had no effect on Fas-mediated death signaling or PMA protection. Further experiments demonstrated that PMA diminished ligand-induced cell surface accumulation of Fas and DR5, and PKCbeta shRNA or enzastaurin reversed this effect. Moreover, enzastaurin sensitized a variety of human tumor cell lines and clinical acute myelogenous leukemia isolates, which express abundant PKCbeta, to tumor necrosis factor-alpha related apoptosis-inducing ligand-induced death in the absence of PMA. Collectively, these results identify a specific PKC isoform that modulates death receptor-mediated cytotoxicity as well as a small molecule inhibitor that mitigates the inhibitory effects of PKC activation on ligand-induced death receptor trafficking and cell death.","['Meng, Xue Wei', 'Heldebrant, Michael P', 'Flatten, Karen S', 'Loegering, David A', 'Dai, Haiming', 'Schneider, Paula A', 'Gomez, Timothy S', 'Peterson, Kevin L', 'Trushin, Sergey A', 'Hess, Allan D', 'Smith, B Douglas', 'Karp, Judith E', 'Billadeau, Daniel D', 'Kaufmann, Scott H']","['Meng XW', 'Heldebrant MP', 'Flatten KS', 'Loegering DA', 'Dai H', 'Schneider PA', 'Gomez TS', 'Peterson KL', 'Trushin SA', 'Hess AD', 'Smith BD', 'Karp JE', 'Billadeau DD', 'Kaufmann SH']","['Department of Molecular Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, Rochester, Minnesota 55905, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091103,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,PMC2801290,2009/11/06 06:00,2010/01/27 06:00,['2009/11/06 06:00'],"['2009/11/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/27 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)58843-1 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M109.057638 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2010 Jan 8;285(2):888-902. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M109.057638.

Here we show that t(17;19)+ ALL cells express Survivin at high levels and that a dominant negative mutant of E2A-HLF suppresses Survivin expression. Forced expression of E2A-HLF in t(17;19)(-) leukemia cells up-regulated Survivin expression, suggesting that Survivin is a downstream target of E2A-HLF. Analysis using a counterflow centrifugal elutriator revealed that t(17;19)+ ALL cells express Survivin throughout the cell cycle. Reporter assays revealed that E2A-HLF induces survivin expression at the transcriptional level likely through indirect down-regulation of a cell cycle-dependent cis element in the promoter region. Down-regulation of Survivin function by a dominant negative mutant of Survivin or reduction of Survivin expression induced massive apoptosis throughout the cell cycle in t(17;19)+ cells mainly through caspase-independent pathways involving translocation of apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) from mitochondria to the nucleus. AIF knockdown conferred resistance to apoptosis caused by down-regulation of Survivin function. These data indicated that reversal of AIF translocation by Survivin, which is induced by E2A-HLF throughout the cell cycle, is one of the key mechanisms in the protection of t(17;19)+ leukemia cells from apoptosis.","['Okuya, Mayuko', 'Kurosawa, Hidemitsu', 'Kikuchi, Jiro', 'Furukawa, Yusuke', 'Matsui, Hirotaka', 'Aki, Daisuke', 'Matsunaga, Takayuki', 'Inukai, Takeshi', 'Goto, Hiroaki', 'Altura, Rachel A', 'Sugita, Kenich', 'Arisaka, Osamu', 'Look, A Thomas', 'Inaba, Toshiya']","['Okuya M', 'Kurosawa H', 'Kikuchi J', 'Furukawa Y', 'Matsui H', 'Aki D', 'Matsunaga T', 'Inukai T', 'Goto H', 'Altura RA', 'Sugita K', 'Arisaka O', 'Look AT', 'Inaba T']","['Department of Pediatrics, Dokkyo Medical University School of Medicine, Tochigi 321-0293, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091102,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,PMC2804343,2009/11/06 06:00,2010/02/09 06:00,['2009/11/06 06:00'],"['2009/11/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/09 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(19)64893-3 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M109.023762 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2010 Jan 15;285(3):1850-60. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M109.023762.

Methotrexate (MTX), a key component of leukemia treatment, is suspected to contribute to treatment-induced cognitive dysfunction. We sought to establish a rodent model in order to further investigate the underlying pathophysiology. PROCEDURES: Intraperitoneal MTX was given to Long-Evans rats on two schedules: acute (250 mg/kg once during adulthood), or chronic (1mg/kg twice weekly x4 doses, beginning at postnatal day 15, then weekly x6). Control rats were given saline injections on the same schedules. All male rats subsequently underwent behavioral testing designed to assess cognitive domains frequently impaired among children treated for ALL. Cerebrospinal fluid and serum folate concentrations were measured by HPLC. FINDINGS: Both acute and chronic MTX administration produced spatial memory deficits, without significantly altering visual memory, general exploration, activity or motor coordination. MTX administration was also associated with a marked reduction in serum and CSF folate and a decrease in the ratio of CSF S-adenosylmethionine to S-adenosylhomocysteine. CONCLUSIONS: Similar to children treated for ALL, rats given systemic MTX develop focal cognitive deficits along with expected alterations in folate physiology.","['Li, Yan', 'Vijayanathan, Veena', 'Gulinello, Maria E', 'Cole, Peter D']","['Li Y', 'Vijayanathan V', 'Gulinello ME', 'Cole PD']","['Department of Pediatrics, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, 1300 Morris Park Ave, Forchheimer 702, Bronx, NY 10461, United States.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091101,United States,Pharmacol Biochem Behav,"Pharmacology, biochemistry, and behavior",0367050,,2009/11/06 06:00,2010/03/24 06:00,['2009/11/06 06:00'],"['2009/09/03 00:00 [received]', '2009/10/01 00:00 [revised]', '2009/10/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/11/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/24 06:00 [medline]']","['S0091-3057(09)00308-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.pbb.2009.10.008 [doi]']",ppublish,Pharmacol Biochem Behav. 2010 Jan;94(3):454-63. doi: 10.1016/j.pbb.2009.10.008.

There is a pressing need for the development of novel tactics for leukemia therapy as conventional treatments often have severe adverse side effects. Tryptanthrin (6,12-dihydro-6,12-dioxoindolo-(2,1-b)-quinazoline) is a naturally-occurring, weakly basic alkaloid isolated from the dried roots of medicinal indigo plants (Ban-Lan-Gen). It has been reported to have various biological and pharmacological activities, including anti-microbial, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory and anti-tumor effects. However, its modulatory effects and action mechanisms on myeloid cells remain poorly understood. In this study, tryptanthrin was shown to suppress the proliferation of the murine myeloid leukemia WEHI-3B JCS cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. It also significantly reduced the growth of WEHI-3B JCS cells in vivo in syngeneic BALB/c mice. However, it exhibited no significant direct cytotoxicity on normal murine peritoneal macrophages. Flow cytometric analysis showed an obvious cell cycle arrest of the tryptanthrin-treated WEHI-3B JCS cells at the G0/G1 phase. The expression of cyclin D2, D3, Cdk 2, 4 and 6 genes in WEHI-3B JCS cells was found to be down-regulated at 24 h as measured by RT-PCR. Morphological and functional studies revealed that tryptanthrin could induce differentiation in WEHI-3B JCS cells, as shown by the increases in vacuolation, cellular granularity and NBT-reducing activity in tryptanthrin-treated cells. Collectively, our findings suggest that tryptanthrin might exert its anti-tumor effect on the murine myelomonocytic leukemia WEHI-3B JCS cells by causing cell cycle arrest and by triggering cell differentiation.","['Chan, Hoi-Ling', 'Yip, Hon-Yan', 'Mak, Nai-Ki', 'Leung, Kwok-Nam']","['Chan HL', 'Yip HY', 'Mak NK', 'Leung KN']","['Department of Biochemistry, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, HKSAR, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,China,Cell Mol Immunol,Cellular & molecular immunology,101242872,PMC4003216,2009/11/06 06:00,2010/06/18 06:00,['2009/11/06 06:00'],"['2009/11/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1038/cmi.2009.44 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Mol Immunol. 2009 Oct;6(5):335-42. doi: 10.1038/cmi.2009.44.,5,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Cyclin D2/genetics', 'Cyclin D3/genetics', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2/genetics', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4/genetics', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Down-Regulation/genetics', 'Drugs, Chinese Herbal/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Macrophages, Peritoneal/drug effects/pathology', 'Mice', 'Myelopoiesis/drug effects', 'Quinazolines/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Time Factors']",,"['0 (Cyclin D2)', '0 (Cyclin D3)', '0 (Drugs, Chinese Herbal)', '0 (Quinazolines)', '13220-57-0 (tryptanthrine)', '8S10GFI6DX (banlangen)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, risk factors for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) during neutropenia recovery in patients with hematologic malignancies have not been studied. METHODS: We studied critically ill patients with hematologic malignancies with the dual objectives of describing patients with ARDS during neutropenia recovery and identifying risk factors for ARDS during neutropenia recovery. A cohort of consecutive neutropenic patients with hematologic malignancies who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) was studied. During a 6-year period, 71 patients recovered from neutropenia, of whom 38 (53.5%) developed ARDS during recovery. RESULTS: Compared with non-ARDS patients, patients who experienced ARDS during neutropenia recovery were more likely to have pneumonia, be admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure, and receive mechanical ventilator therapy. The in-ICU mortality was significantly different between the two groups (86.8% versus 51.5%, respectively, for patients who developed ARDS during neutropenia recovery versus those who did not during neutropenia recovery). In multivariate analysis, only occurrence of pneumonia during the neutropenic episode was associated with a marked increase in the risk of ARDS (odds ratio, 4.76). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with hematologic malignancies complicated by pneumonia during neutropenia are at increased risk for ARDS during neutropenia recovery.","['Rhee, Chin Kook', 'Kang, Ji Young', 'Kim, Yong Hyun', 'Kim, Jin Woo', 'Yoon, Hyung Kyu', 'Kim, Seok Chan', 'Kwon, Soon Suk', 'Kim, Young Kyoon', 'Kim, Kwan Hyung', 'Moon, Hwa Sik', 'Park, Sung Hak', 'Kim, Hee Je', 'Lee, Seok', 'Song, Jeong Sup']","['Rhee CK', 'Kang JY', 'Kim YH', 'Kim JW', 'Yoon HK', 'Kim SC', 'Kwon SS', 'Kim YK', 'Kim KH', 'Moon HS', 'Park SH', 'Kim HJ', 'Lee S', 'Song JS']","['Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, College of Medicine, Catholic University of Korea, Seocho-Gu, Seoul 137-701, Korea. chinkook@catholic.ac.kr']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20091103,England,Crit Care,"Critical care (London, England)",9801902,PMC2811915,2009/11/06 06:00,2010/05/01 06:00,['2009/11/06 06:00'],"['2009/07/08 00:00 [received]', '2009/09/02 00:00 [revised]', '2009/11/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/11/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/01 06:00 [medline]']","['cc8149 [pii]', '10.1186/cc8149 [doi]']",ppublish,Crit Care. 2009;13(6):R173. doi: 10.1186/cc8149.

TKIs such as imatinib, sunitinib and dasatinib are clinically used for treating chronic myeloid leukaemia, gastrointestinal stromal tumours and other malignancies. In addition to their use as anti-cancer agents, increasing evidence points towards an anti-diabetic effect of these TKIs. Imatinib and other TKIs counteract diabetes not only in non-obese diabetic mice, but also in streptozotocin diabetic mice, db/db mice, high-fat-treated rats and humans with T2D (Type 2 diabetes). Although the mechanisms of protection need to be investigated further, the effects of imatinib and other TKIs in human T2D and the rapidly growing findings from animal models of T1D (Type 1 diabetes) and T2D are encouraging and give hope to improved treatment of human diabetes. In the present article, we review the anti-diabetic effects of TKIs which appear to involve both protection against beta-cell death and improved insulin sensitivity. Considering the relatively mild side effects of TKIs, we hypothesize that TKIs could be used to treat new-onset T1D, prevent T1D in individuals at high risk of developing the disease, treat the late stages of T2D and improve the outcome of islet transplantation.","['Mokhtari, Dariush', 'Welsh, Nils']","['Mokhtari D', 'Welsh N']","['Department of Medical Cell Biology, Uppsala University, Biomedicum, P.O.

However, at present, there are practically absent the works on peculiarities of regulation of apoptosis in tnf-knockout (tnf-/-) mice. These mice develop without morphological abnormalities, but they seem to have disturbances of many biological processes, such as inflammation, programmed cell death, etc. Therefore, the goal of our work was to study possible pathways of regulation of apoptosis in the absence of TNF in neurosecretory cells (NSC) of young and old mice. For this purpose, we determined immunohistochemically expression of apoptosis markers caspase-8, -9. Bax, Bcl2, Mcl1, neuropeptide vasopressin, and the apoptosis level in hypothalamus in tnf-knockout mice of different ages as compared with mice with unchanged level of TNF synthesis. It was shown that the apoptosis activation observed during aging did not depend on the tnf gene, and apoptosis at aging was caspase-dependent. It has been revealed that at aging in mouse NSC the external cell death pathway with participation of caspase-8 is activated. The pathways mediating cell death in different neurosecretory centers at aging are different. Thus, in supraoptic nucleus (SON), in all studied animal groups, animal groups, an important cause of the NSC apoptosis is Bax. In paraventricular nucleus (PVN), of the greater importance is a decrease of the antiapoptotic protection. Hence, misbalance of synthesis of proteins of the Bcl-2 family plays an important role in development of senescent apoptosis.","['Bazhanova, E D', 'Pavlov, K I', 'Popovich, I G', 'Anisimov, V N']","['Bazhanova ED', 'Pavlov KI', 'Popovich IG', 'Anisimov VN']",,['rus'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Russia (Federation),Zh Evol Biokhim Fiziol,Zhurnal evoliutsionnoi biokhimii i fiziologii,21820250R,,2009/11/05 06:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/11/05 06:00'],"['2009/11/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Zh Evol Biokhim Fiziol. 2009 Sep-Oct;45(5):518-23.,5,IM,"['Aging/*metabolism', 'Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Biomarkers/metabolism', 'Caspase 8/metabolism', 'Caspase 9/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neurosecretory Systems/cytology/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Supraoptic Nucleus/cytology/*metabolism', '*Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha']",,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '114100-40-2 (Bcl2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Casp8 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Casp9 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We present preliminary results of the first year of our research grant. This is a prospective, analytic, observational study in patients diagnosed with CL and HBV, HCV, HDV chronic infection. We included the following forms of CL: non-Hodgkin malignant lymphoma (NHL), Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). We used the following commercial test kits: HCV RNA Real time PCR on a COBAS TaqMan (Roche Diagnostics) analyzer with 28 to 140.000.000 UI/ml detection range for HCV viremia, HBV DNA Real time PCR on a COBAS TaqMan (Roche Diagnostics) analyzer with 6 to 110.000.000 UI/ml detection range for HBV and the Roboscreen-RoboGene AJ kit with 10-10.000.000 replica/ml detection range for HDV. RESULTS: We have included 20 patients with CL and chronic hepatitis infection so far. Median age of the patients was 61 years. The identified CL forms were: B cell NHL (15 cases), T cell NHL (1 case), CLL (3 cases), Hodgkin lymphoma (1 case), equally distributed in aggressive and indolent forms of CL. HCV infection was diagnosed in 10 patients with CL, HBV infection was found in 10 patients with CL, 3 of them having co-infection HBV + HDV. In 4 patients with HBV infection viremia was over 20.000 IU/ml and the pattern of the CL was the aggressive form of the disease. The feature of the co-infection HBV + HDV was the predominance of indolent forms of CL. Among patients with HCV infection, only 3 cases were detected with viremia over 600.000 IU/ml and CL was represented by aggressive forms of the disease. We also have immunohistochemical data available in 19 cases, which seem to confirm the role of hepatitis viruses in lymphoproliferative disease etiopathogenesis. CONCLUSIONS: We ascertained an almost equally represented prevalence of HCV and HBV infection in patients with CL. The levels of HBV, HCV and HDV viremia were low in most of the cases. The most frequent form of CL was B cell NHL. We found an equal distribution between indolent and aggressive forms of NHL associated to hepatitis virus infection.","['Molagic, Violeta', 'Arama, Victoria', 'Cercel, A Streinu', 'Irimescu, Nicoleta', 'Vladareanu, Ana Maria', 'Olariu, M', 'Arama, S S', 'Rafila, A', 'Dobrea, Camelia', 'Costoiu, S', 'Marza, Maria', 'Otelea, D', 'Paraschiv, Simona', 'Maxim, Dana', 'Popa, Madalina', 'Bumbea, H', 'Ciufu, Cristina', 'Baicus, C', 'Mihailescu, Raluca']","['Molagic V', 'Arama V', 'Cercel AS', 'Irimescu N', 'Vladareanu AM', 'Olariu M', 'Arama SS', 'Rafila A', 'Dobrea C', 'Costoiu S', 'Marza M', 'Otelea D', 'Paraschiv S', 'Maxim D', 'Popa M', 'Bumbea H', 'Ciufu C', 'Baicus C', 'Mihailescu R']","['""Professor Dr. Matei Bals"" National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Bucharest.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Germany,Rom J Intern Med,Romanian journal of internal medicine = Revue roumaine de medecine interne,9304507,,2009/11/05 06:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/11/05 06:00'],"['2009/11/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Rom J Intern Med. 2009;47(1):25-34.,1,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Cohort Studies', 'Hepacivirus/isolation & purification', 'Hepatitis B virus/isolation & purification', 'Hepatitis B, Chronic/*complications', 'Hepatitis C, Chronic/*complications', 'Hepatitis D/*complications', 'Hepatitis Delta Virus/isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/blood/*virology', 'Middle Aged', 'Romania', 'Viremia/complications']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: In phase 1 and pilot studies, the authors evaluated the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) of a 5-day course of cladribine followed by topotecan in pediatric patients with recurrent/refractory AML. The cladribine dose was escalated as follows: 9.1, 13.6, 16.3, and 19.5 mg/m(2) per day (8.9 mg/m(2) per day in the pilot study). Outcome was analyzed according to the absence (Stratum 1) versus presence (Stratum 2) of previous allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Twenty-six patients (20 in Stratum 1 and 6 in Stratum 2) were treated. RESULTS: The MTD was not reached in Stratum 1, but a DLT occurred at the lowest cladribine dosage (9.1 mg/m(2) per day) in Stratum 2. Febrile neutropenia was common in both strata. Nine (34.6%) of 26 patients experienced a complete response, and 7 (30.4%) achieved a partial response; 5 (19.2%) were long-term survivors at the time of last follow-up. Clinical outcome was not associated with cladribine or topotecan systemic exposure. CONCLUSIONS: The combination was well tolerated in Sratum 1, and the response rate was encouraging. This regimen offers a postrecurrence treatment alternative for patients, especially those who have received anthracycline-containing chemotherapy.","['Inaba, Hiroto', 'Stewart, Clinton F', 'Crews, Kristine R', 'Yang, Shengping', 'Pounds, Stanley', 'Pui, Ching-Hon', 'Rubnitz, Jeffrey E', 'Razzouk, Bassem I', 'Ribeiro, Raul C']","['Inaba H', 'Stewart CF', 'Crews KR', 'Yang S', 'Pounds S', 'Pui CH', 'Rubnitz JE', 'Razzouk BI', 'Ribeiro RC']","[""Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105, USA. hiroto.inaba@stjude.org""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,PMC2920745,2009/11/04 06:00,2010/03/10 06:00,['2009/11/04 06:00'],"['2009/11/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.24712 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2010 Jan 1;116(1):98-105. doi: 10.1002/cncr.24712.,1,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cladribine/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Maximum Tolerated Dose', 'Recurrence', 'Retreatment', 'Topotecan/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics']",,"['47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)', '7M7YKX2N15 (Topotecan)']",['Copyright 2010 American Cancer Society.'],,"['P30 CA021765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA021765-31/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,['NIHMS151111'],,,,,,,,,,

Allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation is considered as the only curative option in adults with Philadelphia-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia, but relapse remains the main cause of treatment failure. Moreover, long-term survival rates are markedly decreased when transplanted patients are not in complete remission. Incorporation of tyrosine kinase inhibitors into transplantation strategy in patients with Philadelphia-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia may improve prognosis of the disease. Imatinib combined with conventional chemotherapy and used in conjunction with allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation has improved long-term survival rates. The more potent multikinase inhibitor dasatinib has shown enhanced activity in Philadelphia-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia and has been approved for the treatment of adults with resistance or intolerance to prior imatinib therapy. Here, we present a case of Philadelphia-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia primary resistant to imatinib combined with chemotherapy. Subsequently, the patient underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation as a salvage therapy. Clinical evaluation performed thereafter revealed complete hematologic remission, but with the presence of the minimal residual disease detected at molecular level. Due to imatinib resistance, the therapy with dasatinib was started and complete molecular response was obtained. The consecutive clinical evaluation performed every 3 months during the last 18 months confirmed the absence of molecular minimal residual disease. We believe that inclusion of dasatinib into transplantation strategy allows obtaining sustained molecular remission even in patients resistant to imatinib.","['Czyz, Anna', 'Lewandowski, Krzysztof', 'Kroll, Renata', 'Komarnicki, Mieczyslaw']","['Czyz A', 'Lewandowski K', 'Kroll R', 'Komarnicki M']","['Department of Hematology, Poznan University of Medical Sciences, Szamarzewskiego 84 Str., 60-569, Poznan, Poland. aczyz@onet.eu']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20091103,United States,Med Oncol,"Medical oncology (Northwood, London, England)",9435512,,2009/11/04 06:00,2011/04/09 06:00,['2009/11/04 06:00'],"['2009/10/01 00:00 [received]', '2009/10/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/11/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/04/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12032-009-9347-0 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Oncol. 2010 Dec;27(4):1123-6. doi: 10.1007/s12032-009-9347-0.

Both daunorubicin and ara-C exert their effects in the cell nucleus but by different mechanisms, i.e. daunorubicin causes double stranded DNA breaks by inhibition of the nuclear enzyme, topoisomerase (topo) IIalpha, whereas ara-C is an anti-metabolite that integrates with DNA during DNA synthesis and causes cell cycle arrest. Despite the initial efficacy of these drugs, resistance often develops in the clinical setting. The mechanisms underlying clinical resistance to these drugs are poorly understood, but may be associated with an increase in the proportion of topo IIalpha negative cells. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine whether daunorubicin treatment results in increased numbers of topo IIalpha negative subpopulations in vitro. Acute myeloid leukaemia cells isolated from 12 consenting patients were treated for 24 h with increasing concentrations of daunorubicin or ara-C and the proportion of topo IIalpha-negative cells in surviving cell populations determined by flow cytometry. Treatment with daunorubicin, but not ara-C, resulted in a significant increase in the proportion of topo IIalpha negative cells (p=0.0023). These results suggest that daunorubicin may act by cell cycle arrest and/or by selection of pre-existing topo IIalpha negative subpopulations. Both of these mechanisms can theoretically contribute to a reduced efficacy of a second dose of daunorubicin. The clinical relevance of these interactions should be further elucidated in experimental and clinical studies.","['Tina, Elisabet', 'Prenkert, Malin', 'Hoglund, Martin', 'Paul, Christer', 'Tidefelt, Ulf']","['Tina E', 'Prenkert M', 'Hoglund M', 'Paul C', 'Tidefelt U']","['Clinical Research Centre, Orebro University Hospital, Orebro, Sweden. elisabet.tina@orebroll.se']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Greece,Oncol Rep,Oncology reports,9422756,,2009/11/04 06:00,2010/02/18 06:00,['2009/11/04 06:00'],"['2009/11/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3892/or_00000597 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncol Rep. 2009 Dec;22(6):1527-31. doi: 10.3892/or_00000597.,6,IM,"['Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*biosynthesis', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Survival', 'Cytarabine/*pharmacology', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/*biosynthesis', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Daunorubicin/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*enzymology/*genetics', 'Time Factors']",,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We undertook this study to determine if HS-1793 treatment can bypass the anti-apoptotic effects of Bcl-2 in human renal cancer cells, with a specific focus on the involvement of promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies (PML-NBs). Experiments were conducted with Bcl-2-overexpressing human renal clear cell carcinoma Caki-1 cells. Various apoptosis assessment assays demonstrated that HS-1793 overcomes the resistance conferred by Bcl-2 in Caki-1 cells by inducing apoptosis. We elucidated that HS-1793-induced formation of mature promyelocytic leukemia (PML) nuclear bodies (NBs) correlates with overcoming the anti-apoptotic effects of Bcl-2 in Caki-1 cells. Our findings show that the resveratrol analogue HS-1793 might provide a novel promising strategy for overcoming the resistance conferred by Bcl-2 via PML protein and the formation of mature PML-NBs.","['Jeong, Seung Hun', 'Lee, Jee Suk', 'Jeong, Na Young', 'Kim, Tae Hyun', 'Yoo, Ki Soo', 'Song, Suhee', 'Suh, Hongsuk', 'Kwon, Taeg Kyu', 'Park, Bong Soo', 'Yoo, Young Hyun']","['Jeong SH', 'Lee JS', 'Jeong NY', 'Kim TH', 'Yoo KS', 'Song S', 'Suh H', 'Kwon TK', 'Park BS', 'Yoo YH']","['Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, Dong-A University College of Medicine and Medical Science Research Center, Busan 602-714, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,,2009/11/04 06:00,2010/01/09 06:00,['2009/11/04 06:00'],"['2009/11/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3892/ijo_00000453 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2009 Dec;35(6):1353-60. doi: 10.3892/ijo_00000453.,6,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/physiology', 'Carcinoma, Renal Cell/*metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects/physiology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Intranuclear Inclusion Bodies/*drug effects', 'Kidney Neoplasms/*metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Naphthols/*pharmacology', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Resorcinols/*pharmacology', 'Resveratrol', 'Stilbenes/pharmacology', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/metabolism']",,"['0 (4-(6-hydroxy-2-naphthyl)-1,3-benzenediol)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Naphthols)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Resorcinols)', '0 (Stilbenes)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', 'Q369O8926L (Resveratrol)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recurrent breakpoints identified in the PML and RARA loci in epirubicin-related t-APL were shown to be preferential sites of topoII-induced DNA damage, enhanced by epirubicin.

The long-term neurotoxicities of these two IT strategies have not yet been directly compared. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this multisite study, 171 children with standard-risk ALL, age 1 to 9.99 years at diagnosis, previously randomly assigned to IT methotrexate (n = 82) or to triple IT therapy (n = 89) on CCG 1952, underwent neurocognitive evaluation by a licensed psychologist at a mean of 5.9 years after random assignment. RESULTS: Patients who received IT methotrexate had a mean Processing Speed Index that was 3.6 points lower, about one fourth of a standard deviation, than those who received triple IT therapy (P = .04) after analysis was adjusted for age, sex, and time since diagnosis. Likewise, 19.5% of children in the IT methotrexate group had a Processing Speed Index score in the below-average range compared with 6.9% in the triple IT therapy group (P = .02). Otherwise, the groups performed similarly on tests of full-scale intelligence quotient, academic achievement, attention/concentration, memory, and visual motor integration. The association of treatment with measures of cognitive functioning was not modified by sex or age at diagnosis. In the post-therapy period, there were no group differences in special education services, neurologic events, or use of psychotropic medications. CONCLUSION: This study did not show any clinically meaningful differences in neurocognitive functioning between patients previously randomly assigned to IT methotrexate or triple IT therapy except for a small difference in processing speed in the IT methotrexate group.","['Kadan-Lottick, Nina S', 'Brouwers, Pim', 'Breiger, David', 'Kaleita, Thomas', 'Dziura, James', 'Northrup, Veronika', 'Chen, Lu', 'Nicoletti, Megan', 'Bostrom, Bruce', 'Stork, Linda', 'Neglia, Joseph P']","['Kadan-Lottick NS', 'Brouwers P', 'Breiger D', 'Kaleita T', 'Dziura J', 'Northrup V', 'Chen L', 'Nicoletti M', 'Bostrom B', 'Stork L', 'Neglia JP']","['Section of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA.

METHODS: These recommendations are based on a critical and comprehensive review of the relevant papers up to February 2009 and the results of four consensus conferences held by the panel of experts appointed by ELN in 2008. RESULTS: Cytogenetic monitoring was required at 3, 6, 12, and 18 months. Molecular monitoring was required every 3 months. On the basis of the degree and the timing of hematologic, cytogenetic, and molecular results, the response to first-line imatinib was defined as optimal, suboptimal, or failure, and the response to second-generation TKIs was defined as suboptimal or failure. CONCLUSION: Initial treatment was confirmed as imatinib 400 mg daily. Imatinib should be continued indefinitely in optimal responders. Suboptimal responders may continue on imatinb, at the same or higher dose, or may be eligible for investigational therapy with second-generation TKIs. In instances of imatinib failure, second-generation TKIs are recommended, followed by allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation only in instances of failure and, sometimes, suboptimal response, depending on transplantation risk.","['Baccarani, Michele', 'Cortes, Jorge', 'Pane, Fabrizio', 'Niederwieser, Dietger', 'Saglio, Giuseppe', 'Apperley, Jane', 'Cervantes, Francisco', 'Deininger, Michael', 'Gratwohl, Alois', 'Guilhot, Francois', 'Hochhaus, Andreas', 'Horowitz, Mary', 'Hughes, Timothy', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Larson, Richard', 'Radich, Jerald', 'Simonsson, Bengt', 'Silver, Richard T', 'Goldman, John', 'Hehlmann, Rudiger']","['Baccarani M', 'Cortes J', 'Pane F', 'Niederwieser D', 'Saglio G', 'Apperley J', 'Cervantes F', 'Deininger M', 'Gratwohl A', 'Guilhot F', 'Hochhaus A', 'Horowitz M', 'Hughes T', 'Kantarjian H', 'Larson R', 'Radich J', 'Simonsson B', 'Silver RT', 'Goldman J', 'Hehlmann R']","['Department of Hematology/Oncology, L. and A.

Further investigation revealed that XJW20 selectively induced G2/M arrest and apoptosis in K562 cells. At the molecular level, XJW20-induced G2/M arrest was accompanied by up-regulation of cyclin B1 and phospho (p)-Cdc25C (Ser216) and down-regulation of CDK1. There is no change in the expression of CDK2. The increased apoptotic activity by XJW20 was characterized by an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, the mitochondrial transmembrane potential (DeltaPsi(m)) dissipation, cytochrome C releasing, apoptotic nuclei (AO/EB double staining) and nuclei condensation (DAPI-staining). The down-regulation of phosphorylated ERK was also found in XJW20-treated K562 cells.

Gap junctions are complex membrane structures that transfer molecules between neighboring cells and thereby alter intracellular signaling and metabolism. The gap junction building blocks, the connexins, are also involved in gap junction-independent intercellular communication by forming hemichannels that transfer substances between the intra- and extracellular spaces. Connexins are furthermore involved in cell regulation as single molecules by modulating intracellular pathways and possibly gene transcription. The role of connexins in leukemogenesis and leukemic cell functions are not well characterized.

Yet, despite substantial progress in the structural and biochemical characterization of retroviral budding, the underlying physical mechanism remains poorly understood, particularly with respect to the mechanism by which the virus overcomes the energy barrier associated with the formation of high membrane curvature during viral budding. Using atomic force, fluorescence, and transmission electron microscopy, we find that both human immunodeficiency virus and Moloney murine leukemia virus remodel the actin cytoskeleton of their host. These actin-filamentous structures assemble simultaneously with or immediately after the beginning of budding, and disappear as soon as the nascent virus is released from the cell membrane. Analysis of sections of cryopreserved virus-infected cells by transmission electron microscopy reveals similar actin filament structures emerging from every nascent virus. Substitution of the nucleocapsid domain implicated in actin binding by a leucine-zipper domain results in the budding of virus-like particles without remodeling of the cell's cytoskeleton. Notably, viruses carrying the modified nucleocapsid domains bud more slowly by an order of magnitude compared to the wild-type. The results of this study show that retroviruses utilize the cell cytoskeleton to expedite their assembly and budding.","['Gladnikoff, Micha', 'Shimoni, Eyal', 'Gov, Nir S', 'Rousso, Itay']","['Gladnikoff M', 'Shimoni E', 'Gov NS', 'Rousso I']","['Department of Structural Biology, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Biophys J,Biophysical journal,0370626,PMC2770610,2009/11/04 06:00,2010/02/23 06:00,['2009/11/04 06:00'],"['2009/06/01 00:00 [received]', '2009/07/20 00:00 [revised]', '2009/08/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/11/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/23 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-3495(09)01373-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bpj.2009.08.016 [doi]']",ppublish,Biophys J. 2009 Nov 4;97(9):2419-28. doi: 10.1016/j.bpj.2009.08.016.,9,IM,"['Actins/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Biophysics/methods', 'Cytoskeleton/metabolism', 'Gene Products, gag/metabolism', 'HIV/metabolism', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Atomic Force/methods', 'Microscopy, Electron, Transmission/methods', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence/methods', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/metabolism', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Retroviridae/*metabolism']",,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: K562 cells were cocultured with leukemic MSCs under serum deprivation. Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8), PI staining, Annexin V/PI binding and FACS assays were used to investigate cell proliferation, cell cycle status, and apoptosis of K562 cells cultures in the presence or absence of 10% serum. Western blotting was used to determine the levels of Akt, phosphorylated Akt (p-Akt), the BCL-2 family member Bad, and phosphorylated Bad (p-Bad) proteins in K562 cells after coculturing with MSCs. The effects of LY294002 (a specific inhibitor of PI3K) on protein expression were also determined. RESULTS: K562 cell proliferation was inhibited by coculture with MSCs and the dominant cell cycle was the G0-G1 phase. The proportion of apoptotic K562 cells was decreased and the levels of p-Akt and p-Bad were upregulated after exposing K562 cells to MSCs. However, when LY294002 was used, p-Akt and p-Bad proteins inK562 cells showed a significant reduction, while no distinct variation was seen in the nonphosphorylated Akt and Bad protein levels. CONCLUSION: Leukemic MSCs can inhibit K562 cell expansion and modulate the cell cycle to a state of relative quiescence. This allows the K562 cells to endure adverse conditions such as serum starvation. The PI3K-Akt-Bad signaling pathway may be involved in this antiapoptotic process via phosphorylation of the Akt and Bad proteins. Blocking MSC-induced transduction of the PI3K-Akt-Bad pathway may be a potential strategy for a targeted therapy to combat leukemia.","['Wei, Zhaohui', 'Chen, Naiyao', 'Guo, Hongxing', 'Wang, Xueming', 'Xu, Fangyun', 'Ren, Qian', 'Lu, ShiHong', 'Liu, Bin', 'Zhang, Lei', 'Zhao, Hui']","['Wei Z', 'Chen N', 'Guo H', 'Wang X', 'Xu F', 'Ren Q', 'Lu S', 'Liu B', 'Zhang L', 'Zhao H']","['The Affiliated Hospital, North China Coal Medical college, Tanshan, Heibei, 063000, PR China. john.semple@163.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091103,England,J Exp Clin Cancer Res,Journal of experimental & clinical cancer research : CR,8308647,PMC2779804,2009/11/04 06:00,2010/03/03 06:00,['2009/11/04 06:00'],"['2009/07/27 00:00 [received]', '2009/11/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/11/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/03 06:00 [medline]']","['1756-9966-28-141 [pii]', '10.1186/1756-9966-28-141 [doi]']",epublish,J Exp Clin Cancer Res. 2009 Nov 3;28:141. doi: 10.1186/1756-9966-28-141.,,IM,"['Apoptosis/physiology', 'Cell Communication/*physiology', 'Cell Cycle/physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Culture Media, Serum-Free', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins/metabolism/pharmacology', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/metabolism/*pathology', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/*cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'bcl-Associated Death Protein/metabolism']",,"['0 (BAD protein, human)', '0 (Culture Media, Serum-Free)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (bcl-Associated Death Protein)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A 52-year-old woman presented with urticaria-like skin symptoms, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. Atypical mast cells (CD2+, CD25+, CD117+) with toluidine blue metachromasia were found in the peripheral blood and on bone marrow aspiration smears. Chemotherapy with cytosine arabinoside and idarubicin was ineffective and the patient died of multi-organ failure with rapidly progressing hepatosplenomegaly and large-volume ascites 3 months after admission. At autopsy the bone marrow, spleen, liver, and lymph nodes were extensively infiltrated by atypical tumor cells with occasional bi- or multi-lobated nuclei. They were positive for mast cell tryptase and possessed an activating mutation of the c-kitgene (D816V). Ascites (2200 mL) and non-ruptured esophageal varices with submucosal hemorrhage indicated the presence of severe portal hypertension. Although there was no evidence of liver cirrhosis, the hepatic sinusoids were clogged with tumor cells, with a tendency to be more severe in the perivenular areas, and the lumens of central veins were obliterated by tumor cell infiltration. The present case demonstrates that non-cirrhotic portal hypertension due to blocking of sinusoidal and venous flow could be a serious complication in mast cell leukemia.","['Yoshida, Masayuki', 'Nishikawa, Yuji', 'Yamamoto, Yohei', 'Doi, Yuko', 'Tokairin, Takuo', 'Yoshioka, Toshiaki', 'Omori, Yasufumi', 'Watanabe, Atsushi', 'Takahashi, Naoto', 'Yoshioka, Tomoko', 'Miura, Ikuo', 'Sawada, Ken-ichi', 'Enomoto, Katsuhiko']","['Yoshida M', 'Nishikawa Y', 'Yamamoto Y', 'Doi Y', 'Tokairin T', 'Yoshioka T', 'Omori Y', 'Watanabe A', 'Takahashi N', 'Yoshioka T', 'Miura I', 'Sawada K', 'Enomoto K']","['Department of Molecular Pathology and Tumor Pathology, Akita University Graduate School of Medicine, Akita, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,Australia,Pathol Int,Pathology international,9431380,,2009/11/04 06:00,2010/01/09 06:00,['2009/11/04 06:00'],"['2009/11/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/09 06:00 [medline]']","['PIN2451 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1440-1827.2009.02451.x [doi]']",ppublish,Pathol Int. 2009 Nov;59(11):817-22. doi: 10.1111/j.1440-1827.2009.02451.x.,11,IM,"['Appendicitis/complications', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Female', 'Glomerulonephritis, IGA/complications', 'Humans', 'Hypertension, Portal/*etiology/pathology', 'Leiomyoma/complications', 'Leukemia, Mast-Cell/*complications/physiopathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Ovarian Cysts/complications', 'Uterine Neoplasms/complications']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, few of these association studies could be confirmed in independent studies in the past. Recently, three independent studies did not confirm the prognostic impact of a new functional SNP in the BCL2 gene (-938C>A) described by Nuckel et al. For this reason we genotyped an independent group of patients with CLL (n = 271) with mature follow up and detailed analysis of molecular genetics. The genotype distribution of this BCL2 polymorphism did not differ from that described in the original work. However, genotypes were not associated with time to first treatment (TFT) and overall survival (OS) in univariate or multivariate analysis in the current cohort. Comparing the characteristics of the two study cohorts in more detail we found differences between the two cohorts demonstrating a potentially more aggressive second study cohort. However, TFT and OS in patients with CLL according to Binet A did not differ significantly depending on the genotype. Our findings underscore the need for optimally matched patient cohorts in replication studies. The study re-emphasizes the need for large cohorts and validation in independent data sets before firm conclusions can be made about genotype-phenotype associations.","['Zenz, Thorsten', 'Benner, Axel', 'Duhrsen, Ulrich', 'Durig, Jan', 'Dohner, Hartmut', 'Siffert, Winfried', 'Stilgenbauer, Stephan', 'Nuckel, Holger']","['Zenz T', 'Benner A', 'Duhrsen U', 'Durig J', 'Dohner H', 'Siffert W', 'Stilgenbauer S', 'Nuckel H']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Ulm, Ulm, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,2009/11/04 06:00,2010/02/03 06:00,['2009/11/04 06:00'],"['2009/11/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/03 06:00 [medline]']","['10.3109/10428190903207530 [pii]', '10.3109/10428190903207530 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2009 Nov;50(11):1837-42. doi: 10.3109/10428190903207530.,11,IM,"['Cohort Studies', 'Disease Progression', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genotype', 'Germany', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/pathology/*therapy', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Outcome Assessment, Health Care/statistics & numerical data', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*genetics', 'Survival Analysis', 'Time Factors']",,['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Prior to the development of imatinib mesylate (Gleevec), treatment was limited and provided only limited survival benefit. Imatinib has dramatically changed the course of the disease and has led to the significantly prolonged survival in the majority of patients. However, there is growing concern for resistance to imatinib and to subsequent second generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors (dasatinib and nilotinib) due to the T315I mutation. With no currently approved effective treatment for TKI-resistant CML with the T315I mutation, molecularly-based, targeted drug development has focused on several strategies to overcome resistance. In this review, we describe agents which overcome the T315I mutation, as well as native BCR-ABL, via several mechanisms, including increased degradation of BCR-ABL, optimization of direct inhibition of the BCR-ABL kinase, inhibition of BCR-ABL-mediated cell growth via interruption of the BCR-ABL-mediated transcription, protein synthesis or post-translational modification, all of which lead to decreased proliferation and malignant cell death.","['Cooper, Susannah', 'Giles, Francis J', 'Savona, Michael R']","['Cooper S', 'Giles FJ', 'Savona MR']","['Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Medicine, San Antonio Military Medical Center, San Antonio, TX 78236, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,2009/11/04 06:00,2010/02/03 06:00,['2009/11/04 06:00'],"['2009/11/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/03 06:00 [medline]']","['10.3109/10428190903267559 [pii]', '10.3109/10428190903267559 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2009 Nov;50(11):1785-93. doi: 10.3109/10428190903267559.,11,IM,"['Benzamides/therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Models, Biological', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrazoles/therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects']",74,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '639089-54-6 (VX680)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'M3X659D0FY (danusertib)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A cyclic peptide, cIBR, possesses high affinity for LFA-1, and conjugation to the surface of poly(DL-lactic-co-glycolic acid) nanoparticles can specifically target and deliver the encapsulated agents to T cells expressing LFA-1. The kinetics of targeted nanoparticle uptake by acute lymphoblastic leukemia T cells was investigated by flow cytometry and microscopy and compared to untargeted nanoparticles. The specificity of targeted nanoparticles binding to the LFA-1 integrin was demonstrated by competitive inhibition using free cIBR peptide or using the I domain of LFA-1 to inhibit the binding of targeted nanoparticles. The uptake of targeted nanoparticles was concentration and energy dependent. The cIBR-conjugated nanoparticles did not appear to localize with lysosomes whereas untargeted nanoparticles were detected in lysosomes in 6 h and steadily accumulated in lysosomes for 24 h. Finally, T-cell adhesion to epithelial cells was inhibited by cIBR nanoparticles. Thus, nanoparticles displaying the cIBR ligand may offer a useful targeted drug delivery system as an alternative treatment of inflammatory diseases involving transmigration of leukocytes.","['Chittasupho, Chuda', 'Manikwar, Prakash', 'Krise, Jeffrey P', 'Siahaan, Teruna J', 'Berkland, Cory']","['Chittasupho C', 'Manikwar P', 'Krise JP', 'Siahaan TJ', 'Berkland C']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, The University of Kansas, Lawrence, Kansas 66047, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",,United States,Mol Pharm,Molecular pharmaceutics,101197791,PMC2815130,2009/11/04 06:00,2010/04/20 06:00,['2009/11/04 06:00'],"['2009/11/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/mp900185u [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Pharm. 2010 Feb 1;7(1):146-55. doi: 10.1021/mp900185u.,1,IM,"['Biological Transport, Active', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Aggregation', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Humans', 'Lactic Acid', 'Ligands', 'Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1/*metabolism', 'Lysosomes/metabolism', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Nanoparticles/chemistry', 'Peptides, Cyclic/*metabolism', 'Polyglycolic Acid', 'Polylactic Acid-Polyglycolic Acid Copolymer', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*metabolism/pathology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism/pathology', 'Temperature']",,"['0 (Ligands)', '0 (Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1)', '0 (Peptides, Cyclic)', '0 (cIBR peptide)', '1SIA8062RS (Polylactic Acid-Polyglycolic Acid Copolymer)', '26009-03-0 (Polyglycolic Acid)', '33X04XA5AT (Lactic Acid)']",,,"['P20 RR015563-076485/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM08359-11/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'P20 RR016443-096682/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'P20 RR015563/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'R03 AR054035/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI063002-01A1/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R03 AR054035-03/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'P20 RR016443-086923/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'P20 RR015563-060017/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI063002/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI063002-03/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'P20 RR016443-105872/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI063002-02/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM008359/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R03 AR054035-01A1/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R03 AR054035-02/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'P20 RR016443/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'P20 RR015563-086731/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI063002-04/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,['NIHMS160013'],,,,,,,,,,

The structures of spirohexenolides A (1) and B (2) were elucidated through X-ray crystallography and confirmed by 1D and 2D NMR studies. Under all examined culture conditions, spirohexenolide A (1) was the major metabolite with traces of spirohexenolide B (2) arising in cultures containing increased loads of adsorbent resins. Spirohexenolide A (1) inhibited tumor cell growth with GI(50) values spanning from 0.1 to 17 microM across the NCI 60 cell line panel. An increased activity was observed in leukemia (GI(50) value of 254 nM in RPMI-8226 cells), lung cancer (GI(50) value of 191 nM in HOP-92 cells), and colon cancer (GI(50) value of 565 nM in SW-620 cells) tumor cells. Metabolite 1 was fluorescent and could be examined on a confocal fluorescent microscope with conventional laser excitation and filter sets. Time lapse imaging studies indicated that spirohexenolide A (1) was readily taken up by tumor cells, appearing through the cell immediately after dosing and subcellularly localizing in the lysosomes. This activity, combined with a unique selectivity in NCI 60 cancer cell line screening, indicates that 1 warrants further chemotherapeutic evaluation.","['Kang, MinJin', 'Jones, Brian D', 'Mandel, Alexander L', 'Hammons, Justin C', 'DiPasquale, Antonio G', 'Rheingold, Arnold L', 'La Clair, James J', 'Burkart, Michael D']","['Kang M', 'Jones BD', 'Mandel AL', 'Hammons JC', 'DiPasquale AG', 'Rheingold AL', 'La Clair JJ', 'Burkart MD']","['Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of California, San Diego, 9500 Gilman Drive, La Jolla, California 92093, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Org Chem,The Journal of organic chemistry,2985193R,,2009/11/04 06:00,2010/03/10 06:00,['2009/11/04 06:00'],"['2009/11/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/jo901826d [doi]'],ppublish,J Org Chem. 2009 Dec 4;74(23):9054-61. doi: 10.1021/jo901826d.,23,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/metabolism/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Crystallography, X-Ray', '*Drug Discovery', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Heterocyclic Compounds, 4 or More Rings/metabolism/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Lysosomes/metabolism', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Molecular Structure', 'Mutagenesis', 'Streptomyces/*metabolism']",,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Heterocyclic Compounds, 4 or More Rings)', '0 (spirohexenolide A)', '0 (spirohexenolide B)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Gemcitabine nanoassemblies exhibited far greater activity than free gemcitabine against both subcutaneously grafted solid tumors (L1210 and P388) and aggressive metastatic leukemia (leukemia L1210 wt, P388 and RNK-16 LGL).

A crucial element in a robust clinical production method for hNPCs is a serum-free growth medium that can support the rapid expansion of cells while retaining their multipotency. Here, we report the development of a cell growth medium (PPRF-h2) for the expansion of hNPCs, achieving an overall cell-fold expansion of 10(13) over a period of 140 days in stationary culture which is significantly greater than other literature results. More importantly, hNPC expansion could be scaled-up from stationary culture to suspension bioreactors using this medium. Serial subculturing of the cells in suspension bioreactors resulted in an overall cell-fold expansion of 7.8 x 10(13) after 140 days. These expanded cells maintained their multipotency including the capacity to generate large numbers of neurons (about 60%). In view of our previous studies regarding successful transplantation of the bioreactor-expanded hNPCs in animal models of neurological disorders, these results have demonstrated that PPRF-h2 (containing dehydroepiandrosterone, basic fibroblast growth factor and human leukemia inhibitory factor) can successfully facilitate the production of large quantities of hNPCs with potential to be used in the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders.","['Baghbaderani, Behnam A', 'Mukhida, Karim', 'Sen, Arindom', 'Kallos, Michael S', 'Hong, Murray', 'Mendez, Ivar', 'Behie, Leo A']","['Baghbaderani BA', 'Mukhida K', 'Sen A', 'Kallos MS', 'Hong M', 'Mendez I', 'Behie LA']","['Pharmaceutical Production Research Facility (PPRF), Schulich School of Engineering, University of Calgary, 2500 University Drive NW, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Biotechnol Bioeng,Biotechnology and bioengineering,7502021,,2009/11/03 06:00,2010/02/25 06:00,['2009/11/03 06:00'],"['2009/11/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/bit.22590 [doi]'],ppublish,Biotechnol Bioeng. 2010 Mar 1;105(4):823-33. doi: 10.1002/bit.22590.,4,IM,"['*Bioreactors', 'Cell Culture Techniques/*methods', 'Cell- and Tissue-Based Therapy', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Humans', 'Neurodegenerative Diseases/*therapy', '*Neurogenesis', 'Neurons/*cytology']",,,"['(c) 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Support vector machine algorithm was used to obtain diagnostic model that discriminated proteomic spectra of patients with AL from that of controls. Twenty-six features with p<0.00001 had optimal discriminatory performance, with 97% sensitivity and 100% specificity. Statistical analysis revealed that two peptides with m/z 1778 and 1865 were gradually decreased in their relative intensities with increase of remission degree. Moreover, the peptide with m/z 1865 was also found to be correlated with AL types. With FT-ICR-MS detection, both the peptides were identified as fragments of complement C3f. Linear regression analysis showed that the combined use of them could discriminate PML/RAR alpha positive M3 from molecular remission M3. Two fragments of complement C3f were significantly correlated with MRD levels and could be used for clinical practice in MRD assessment.","['Liang, Tingting', 'Wang, Na', 'Li, Wei', 'Li, Ailing', 'Wang, Jie', 'Cui, Jiuwei', 'Liu, Nian', 'Li, Yan', 'Li, Ling', 'Yang, Guozi', 'Du, ZhongHua', 'Li, Dan', 'He, Kun', 'Wang, Guanjun']","['Liang T', 'Wang N', 'Li W', 'Li A', 'Wang J', 'Cui J', 'Liu N', 'Li Y', 'Li L', 'Yang G', 'Du Z', 'Li D', 'He K', 'Wang G']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, First Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, PR China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Germany,Proteomics,Proteomics,101092707,,2009/11/03 06:00,2010/02/24 06:00,['2009/11/03 06:00'],"['2009/11/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pmic.200900513 [doi]'],ppublish,Proteomics. 2010 Jan;10(1):90-8. doi: 10.1002/pmic.200900513.,1,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Arginine/metabolism', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*blood/chemistry', 'Complement C3b/*analysis/chemistry', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*blood/diagnosis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*blood/chemistry/diagnosis', 'Proteomics', 'Young Adult']",,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (complement C3f-des-arginine)', '80295-43-8 (Complement C3b)', '94ZLA3W45F (Arginine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we show that elevation of cAMP in pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia NALM-6 cells significantly attenuated phosphorylation state of p53 at Ser6, Ser9, Ser15, Ser20, Ser37, Ser46 and Ser392 upon exposure to doxorubicin. Increased cAMP levels also shifted the ratio of the death promoter to death repressor genes via alteration of Bcl-2 and Bax proteins expression.

The endonuclease responsible for this type of DNA degradation is the DNA fragmentation factor (DFF). DFF is a complex of the endonuclease DFF40 and its chaperone/inhibitor, DFF45. In vitro work has shown that histone H1 and HMGB1/2 recruit/target DFF40 to the internucleosomal linker regions of chromatin and that histone H1 directly interacts with DFF40 conferring DNA binding ability and enhancing its nuclease activity. The histone H1 family is comprised of many subtypes, which recent work has shown may have distinct roles in chromatin function. Thus we studied the binding association of DFF40 with specific H1 subtypes and whether these binding associations are altered after the induction of apoptosis in an in vivo cellular context. The apoptotic agent used in this study is the histone deacetylase inhibitor, trichostatin A (TSA). We separated the insoluble chromatin-enriched fraction from the soluble nuclear fraction of the NB4 leukemic cell line. Using MNase digestion, we provide evidence which strongly suggests that the heterodimer, DFF40-DFF45, is localized to the chromatin fraction under apoptotic as well as non-apoptotic conditions. Moreover, we present results that show that DFF40 interacts with the all H1 subtypes used in this study, but preferentially interacts with specific H1 subtypes after the induction of apoptosis by TSA. These results illustrate for the first time the association of DFF40 with individual H1 subtypes, under a specific apoptotic stimulus in an in vivo cellular context.","['Ninios, Yiannis P', 'Sekeri-Pataryas, Kalliope E', 'Sourlingas, Thomae G']","['Ninios YP', 'Sekeri-Pataryas KE', 'Sourlingas TG']","['Institute of Biology, National Centre for Scientific Research Demokritos, 153 10 Aghia Paraskevi, Attikis, Greece.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,Apoptosis,Apoptosis : an international journal on programmed cell death,9712129,,2009/11/03 06:00,2010/05/04 06:00,['2009/11/03 06:00'],"['2009/11/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10495-009-0418-7 [doi]'],ppublish,Apoptosis. 2010 Feb;15(2):128-38. doi: 10.1007/s10495-009-0418-7.,2,IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'Blotting, Western', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Caspase 9/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Nucleus/drug effects/*enzymology', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Chemical Fractionation', 'Chromatin/metabolism', 'Deoxyribonucleases/*metabolism', 'Histones/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/*pharmacology', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Leukemia/*enzymology', 'Poly-ADP-Ribose Binding Proteins', 'Protein Transport/drug effects', 'Proteins/*metabolism', 'Substrate Specificity/drug effects']",,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (Poly-ADP-Ribose Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (caspase-activated DNase inhibitor)', '3X2S926L3Z (trichostatin A)', 'EC 3.1.- (DFFB protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.- (Deoxyribonucleases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In support of this model, we found in acute myeloid leukemia cells with hypermethylated p15INK4B and E-cadherin promoters that the DNMT inhibitor, 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine, induced p15INK4B and E-cadherin expression, and decreased levels of DNA methylation, histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9) methylation and SUV39H1 associated with p15INK4B and E-cadherin promoters. On the basis of these observations, we examined whether promoter demethylation was dominant to H3K9 demethylation in p15INK4B and E-cadherin reexpression. We observed that SUV39H1 short hairpin RNA and chaetocin, a SUV39H1 inhibitor, induced p15INK4B and E-cadherin expression and H3K9 demethylation without promoter demethylation. Reexpression of hypermethylated p15INK4B and E-cadherin required histone H3K9 demethylation that was achieved directly by inhibiting SUV39H1 expression or activity, or indirectly by decreasing the amount of SUV39H1 associated with the p15INK4B and E-cadherin promoters using 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine.

Essential downstream molecules involve mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and S6-kinase. Here, we present a comprehensive analysis of the molecular events involved in activation of these key signaling pathways. We provide evidence for a previously unrecognized phospholipase C-gamma1 (PLC-gamma1)-controlled mechanism of mTOR/p70S6-kinase activation, which operates in parallel to the classical Akt-dependent machinery. Short-term imatinib treatment of Bcr-Abl-positive cells caused dephosphorylation of p70S6-K and S6-protein without inactivation of Akt. Suppression of Akt activity alone did not affect phosphorylation of p70-S6K and S6. These results suggested the existence of an alternative mechanism for mTOR/p70S6-K activation. In Bcr-Abl-expressing cells, we detected strong PLC-gamma1 activation, which was suppressed by imatinib. Pharmacological inhibition and siRNA knockdown of PLC-gamma1 blocked p70S6-K and S6 phosphorylation. By inhibiting the Ca-signaling, CaMK and PKCs we demonstrated participation of these molecules in the pathway. Suppression of PLC-gamma1 led to inhibition of cell proliferation and enhanced apoptosis. The novel pathway proved to be essential for survival and proliferation of leukemic cells and almost complete cell death was observed upon combined PLC-gamma1 and Bcr-Abl inhibition. The pivotal role of PLC-gamma1 was further confirmed in a mouse leukemogenesis model.","['Markova, B', 'Albers, C', 'Breitenbuecher, F', 'Melo, J V', 'Brummendorf, T H', 'Heidel, F', 'Lipka, D', 'Duyster, J', 'Huber, C', 'Fischer, T']","['Markova B', 'Albers C', 'Breitenbuecher F', 'Melo JV', 'Brummendorf TH', 'Heidel F', 'Lipka D', 'Duyster J', 'Huber C', 'Fischer T']","['Department of Medicine (Cancer Research), West German Cancer Center, University Hospital, Essen, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20091102,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,,2009/11/03 06:00,2010/03/03 06:00,['2009/11/03 06:00'],"['2009/11/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/03 06:00 [medline]']","['onc2009374 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2009.374 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2010 Feb 4;29(5):739-51. doi: 10.1038/onc.2009.374.

These proteins eluted in the void volume fractions following Mono Q anion exchange chromatography and immunostained with ARMAs. These ARMAs showed specific binding to the proteins in a saturable manner that depended on antibody concentration. Certain of these proteins co-migrated with histones on one-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. It was also found that histones isolated from HL60 cells treated with RA also immunostained with ARMAs.

DESIGN AND METHODS: On hundred and seventy-two specimens were immunostained for the SOX11 N and C termini. Cyclin D1 was detected by immunohistochemistry and quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction; in situ hybridization for t(11;14) was applied when needed. RESULTS: Nuclear SOX11 was strongly expressed in most B and T-lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphomas and half of childhood Burkitt's lymphomas, but only weakly expressed in some hairy cell leukemias.

Its expression is independent of cyclin D1 (except for weak expression in hairy cell leukemias) and unlikely to be due to translocations in lymphoid neoplasia.","['Dictor, Michael', 'Ek, Sara', 'Sundberg, Maria', 'Warenholt, Janina', 'Gyorgy, Czabafy', 'Sernbo, Sandra', 'Gustavsson, Elin', 'Abu-Alsoud, Waleed', 'Wadstrom, Torkel', 'Borrebaeck, Carl']","['Dictor M', 'Ek S', 'Sundberg M', 'Warenholt J', 'Gyorgy C', 'Sernbo S', 'Gustavsson E', 'Abu-Alsoud W', 'Wadstrom T', 'Borrebaeck C']","['Department of Pathology, Lund University Hospital, Sweden. michael.dictor@med.lu.se']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,PMC2770967,2009/11/03 06:00,2010/01/09 06:00,['2009/11/03 06:00'],"['2009/11/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/09 06:00 [medline]']","['94/11/1563 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2009.008474 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2009 Nov;94(11):1563-8. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2009.008474.,11,IM,"['Burkitt Lymphoma/*chemistry', 'Cyclin D1/analysis', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/*chemistry', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'SOXC Transcription Factors/*analysis/genetics']",,"['0 (SOX11 protein, human)', '0 (SOXC Transcription Factors)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)']",,,,['Haematologica. 2009 Nov;94(11):1488-92.

However, a fraction of leukemic cells persists under targeted therapy and can lead to disease progression on cessation of treatment. DESIGN AND METHODS: We analyzed bone marrow progenitor cells with the side population phenotype, and characterized the role of the intracellular ABC transporter A3 in imatinib detoxification. RESULTS: BCR-ABL-positive leukemic cells contribute to the side population cell compartment in untreated patients. Such leukemic side population cells, as well as CD34-positive progenitors from chronic myeloid leukemia samples, strongly express the intracellular ABCA3. Functionally, ABCA3 levels are critical for the susceptibility of chronic myeloid leukemia blast cell lines to specific BCR-ABL inhibition by imatinib. The transporter is localized in the limiting membrane of lysosomes and multivesicular bodies, and intracellular [(14)C]-labeled imatinib accumulates in such organelles. The lysosomal storage capacity increases with ABCA3 expression, thus regulating imatinib sequestration. CONCLUSIONS: The intracellular ABC transporter A3 is expressed in chronic myeloid leukemia progenitor cells and may contribute to intrinsic imatinib resistance by facilitating lysosomal sequestration in chronic myeloid leukemia cells.","['Chapuy, Bjoern', 'Panse, Melanie', 'Radunski, Ulf', 'Koch, Raphael', 'Wenzel, Dirk', 'Inagaki, Nobuya', 'Haase, Detlef', 'Truemper, Lorenz', 'Wulf, Gerald G']","['Chapuy B', 'Panse M', 'Radunski U', 'Koch R', 'Wenzel D', 'Inagaki N', 'Haase D', 'Truemper L', 'Wulf GG']","['Department Hematology and Oncology, Georg-August-University, Goettingen Robert-Koch-Str.40, 37075 Goettingen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,PMC2770963,2009/11/03 06:00,2010/01/09 06:00,['2009/11/03 06:00'],"['2009/11/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/09 06:00 [medline]']","['94/11/1528 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2009.008631 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2009 Nov;94(11):1528-36. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2009.008631.,11,IM,"['ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/analysis/*physiology', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Resistance', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Lysosomes/*metabolism', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology']",,"['0 (ABCA3 protein, human)', '0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several of these p300 targets are immediate early genes, including FOS, implicating a prominent role for p300 in the control of primary genetic responses. The recruitment of p300 and pol II rapidly transitions to the assembly of several elongation factors, including the positive transcriptional elongation factor (P-TEFb), the bromodomain-containing protein (BRD4), and the elongin-like eleven nineteen lysine-rich leukemia protein (ELL). However, transcription at many of these rapidly induced genes is transient, wherein swift departure of P-TEFb, BRD4, and ELL coincides with termination of transcriptional elongation. Unexpectedly, both p300 and pol II remain accumulated or ""bookmarked"" at the proximal promoter long after transcription has terminated, demarking a clear mechanistic separation between the recruitment and elongation phases of transcription in vivo. The bookmarked pol II is depleted of both serine-2 and serine-5 phosphorylation of its C-terminal domain and remains proximally positioned at the promoter for hours. Surprisingly, these p300/pol II bookmarked genes can be readily reactivated, and elongation factors can be reassembled by subsequent addition of nonmitogenic agents that, alone, have minimal effects on transcription in the absence of prior preconditioning by mitogen stimulation. These findings suggest that p300 is likely to play an important role in biological processes in which transcriptional bookmarking or preconditioning influences cellular growth and development through the dynamic priming of genes for response to rechallenge by secondary stimuli.","['Byun, Jung S', 'Wong, Madeline M', 'Cui, Wenwu', 'Idelman, Gila', 'Li, Quentin', 'De Siervi, Adriana', 'Bilke, Sven', 'Haggerty, Cynthia M', 'Player, Audrey', 'Wang, Yong Hong', 'Thirman, Michael J', 'Kaberlein, Joseph J', 'Petrovas, Constantinos', 'Koup, Richard A', 'Longo, Dan', 'Ozato, Keiko', 'Gardner, Kevin']","['Byun JS', 'Wong MM', 'Cui W', 'Idelman G', 'Li Q', 'De Siervi A', 'Bilke S', 'Haggerty CM', 'Player A', 'Wang YH', 'Thirman MJ', 'Kaberlein JJ', 'Petrovas C', 'Koup RA', 'Longo D', 'Ozato K', 'Gardner K']","['Laboratory of Receptor Biology and Gene Expression, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",20091030,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,PMC2780808,2009/11/03 06:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/11/03 06:00'],"['2009/11/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['0905469106 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.0905469106 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2009 Nov 17;106(46):19286-91. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0905469106.

Correspondingly, the initial clinical trials demonstrated similar response rates for CML patients after imatinib failure, irrespective of the mutation status. However, on closer examination, clinical evidence now indicates that some mutations are less sensitive to nilotinib (Y253H, E255K/V, and F359V/C) or dasatinib (F317L and V299L). T315I is insensitive to both. Novel mutations (F317I/V/C and T315A) are less sensitive/insensitive to dasatinib. We refer to these collectively as second-generation inhibitor (SGI) clinically relevant mutations. By in vitro analysis, other mutations confer a degree of insensitivity; however, clinical evidence is currently insufficient to define them as SGI clinically relevant. Here we examine the mutations that are clearly SGI clinically relevant, those with minimal impact on response, and those for which more data are needed. In our series of patients with mutations at imatinib cessation and/or at nilotinib or dasatinib commencement, 43% had SGI clinically relevant mutations, including 14% with T315I. The frequency of SGI clinically relevant mutations was dependent on the disease phase at imatinib failure. The clinical data suggest that a mutation will often be detectable after imatinib failure for which there is compelling clinical evidence that one SGI should be preferred.","['Branford, Susan', 'Melo, Junia V', 'Hughes, Timothy P']","['Branford S', 'Melo JV', 'Hughes TP']","['Centre for Cancer Biology, Departments of Molecular Pathology and Haematology, SA Pathology, Adelaide, Australia. susan.branford@health.sa.gov.au']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091030,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,2009/11/03 06:00,2010/02/10 06:00,['2009/11/03 06:00'],"['2009/11/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/10 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)38762-0 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2009-08-215939 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2009 Dec 24;114(27):5426-35. doi: 10.1182/blood-2009-08-215939.

A 38-gene expression classifier predictive of relapse-free survival (RFS) could distinguish 2 groups with differing relapse risks: low (4-year RFS, 81%, n = 109) versus high (4-year RFS, 50%, n = 98; P < .001). In multivariate analysis, the gene expression classifier (P = .001) and flow cytometric measures of minimal residual disease (MRD; P = .001) each provided independent prognostic information. Together, they could be used to classify children with high-risk ALL into low- (87% RFS), intermediate- (62% RFS), or high- (29% RFS) risk groups (P < .001). A 21-gene expression classifier predictive of end-induction MRD effectively substituted for flow MRD, yielding a combined classifier that could distinguish these 3 risk groups at diagnosis (P < .001). These classifiers were further validated on an independent high-risk ALL cohort (P = .006) and retainedindependent prognostic significance (P < .001) in the presence of other recently described poor prognostic factors (IKAROS/IKZF1 deletions, JAK mutations, and kinase expression signatures).

Apoptotic resistance resulting from constitutive activation of survival signaling pathways is a fundamental pathogenic mechanism. Recent network modeling analyses identified platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) as a key master switch in controlling these survival pathways in T-cell LGL leukemia. Here we show that an autocrine PDGF regulatory loop mediates survival of leukemic LGLs of both T- and NK-cell origin. We found high levels of circulating PDGF-BB in platelet-poor plasma samples from LGL leukemia patients. Production of PDGF-BB by leukemic LGLs was demonstrated by immunocytochemical staining. Leukemic cells expressed much higher levels of PDGFR-beta transcripts than purified normal CD8(+) T cells or NK cells. We observed that phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3 kinase), Src family kinase (SFK), and downstream protein kinase B (PKB)/AKT pathways were constitutively activated in both T- and NK-LGL leukemia. Pharmacologic blockade of these pathways led to apoptosis of leukemic LGLs. Neutralizing antibody to PDGF-BB inhibited PKB/AKT phosphorylation induced by LGL leukemia sera. These results suggest that targeting of PDGF-BB, a pivotal regulator for the long-term survival of leukemic LGLs, may be an important therapeutic strategy.","['Yang, Jun', 'Liu, Xin', 'Nyland, Susan B', 'Zhang, Ranran', 'Ryland, Lindsay K', 'Broeg, Kathleen', 'Baab, Kendall Thomas', 'Jarbadan, Nancy Ruth', 'Irby, Rosalyn', 'Loughran, Thomas P Jr']","['Yang J', 'Liu X', 'Nyland SB', 'Zhang R', 'Ryland LK', 'Broeg K', 'Baab KT', 'Jarbadan NR', 'Irby R', 'Loughran TP Jr']","['Penn State Hershey Cancer Institute, Department of Medicine, College of Medicine, Pennsylvania State University, Hershey, PA, USA. jyang@psu.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20091030,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,PMC2803691,2009/11/03 06:00,2010/01/22 06:00,['2009/11/03 06:00'],"['2009/11/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/22 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)30107-5 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2009-06-223719 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 Jan 7;115(1):51-60. doi: 10.1182/blood-2009-06-223719.

Antiproliferative effects followed by significant, nonapoptotic, cell death within 72 hours occurred in 24 of 26 acute myeloid leukemia, 0 of 6 acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and 3 of 6 chronic myeloid leukemia patient samples exposed to SB, but not recombinant human thrombopoietin (rhTpo), in liquid suspension culture. Further investigation revealed increased phosphorylation of p70S6/S6 kinases in SB-, but not in rhTpo-, treated cells. Expression profiling of cells exposed to SB versus rhTpo revealed statistically significant, more than 2-fold changes in GAPDH and REDD1 gene expression, confirmed by quantitative reverse-transcribed polymerase chain reaction. These genes, induced in energy or hypoxia stressed cells, have been implicated in cell death pathways, and may provide important clues to the mechanism of SB-induced, leukemic cell death. These results suggest that nonpeptidyl, hydrazone class Mpl agonists may be clinically useful antileukemic agents by virtue of their combined thrombopoietic and antileukemic effects.","['Kalota, Anna', 'Gewirtz, Alan M']","['Kalota A', 'Gewirtz AM']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091030,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,2009/11/03 06:00,2010/01/22 06:00,['2009/11/03 06:00'],"['2009/11/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/22 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)30111-7 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2009-06-227751 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 Jan 7;115(1):89-93. doi: 10.1182/blood-2009-06-227751.

After transfer into human CD20 (hCD20) transgenic mice, cTCR(+) T cells showed antigen-specific delayed egress from the lungs, concomitant with T-cell deletion. Few cTCR(+) T cells reached the bone marrow (BM) in hCD20 transgenic mice, precluding effectiveness against leukemia. Anti-hCD20 antibody-mediated B-cell depletion before adoptive T-cell therapy permitted egress of mouse CD20-specific cTCR(+) T cells from the lungs, enhanced T-cell survival, and promoted cTCR(+) T cell-dependent elimination of established mouse CD20(+) leukemia. Furthermore, CD20-specific cTCR(+) T cells eliminated residual B cells refractory to depletion with monoclonal antibodies. These findings suggest that combination of antibody therapy that depletes antigen-expressing normal tissues with adoptive T-cell immunotherapy enhances the ability of cTCR(+) T cells to survive and control tumors.","['James, Scott E', 'Orgun, Nural N', 'Tedder, Thomas F', 'Shlomchik, Mark J', 'Jensen, Michael C', 'Lin, Yukang', 'Greenberg, Philip D', 'Press, Oliver W']","['James SE', 'Orgun NN', 'Tedder TF', 'Shlomchik MJ', 'Jensen MC', 'Lin Y', 'Greenberg PD', 'Press OW']","['Clinical Research, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091030,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,PMC2798862,2009/11/03 06:00,2010/02/10 06:00,['2009/11/03 06:00'],"['2009/11/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/10 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)38765-6 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2009-08-232967 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2009 Dec 24;114(27):5454-63. doi: 10.1182/blood-2009-08-232967.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Seventy-seven patients with low-grade or mantle cell lymphoma received autologous stem-cell transplantation (ASCT) on a phase II study. Rituximab 375 mg/m(2) was administered 3 days before mobilization-dose cyclophosphamide, then weekly for four doses after count recovery from ASCT. Immune reconstitution was assessed. RESULTS: Sixty percent of transplants occurred in first remission. Actuarial event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) were 60% and 73%, respectively, at 5 years, with 7.2-year median follow-up for OS in surviving patients. Median EFS was 8.3 years. Older age and transformed lymphomas were independently associated with inferior EFS, whereas day 60 lymphocyte counts did not predict EFS or late infections. Early and late transplant-related mortality was 1% and 8%, with secondary leukemia in two patients. B-cell counts recovered by 1-2 years; however, the median IgG level remained low at 2 years. Late-onset idiopathic neutropenia, generally inconsequential, was noted in 43%. CONCLUSION: ASCT with rituximab can produce durable remissions on follow-up out to 10 years. Major infections do not appear to be significantly increased or to be predicted by immune monitoring.","['Kasamon, Y L', 'Jones, R J', 'Brodsky, R A', 'Fuchs, E J', 'Matsui, W', 'Luznik, L', 'Powell, J D', 'Blackford, A L', 'Goodrich, A', 'Gocke, C D', 'Abrams, R A', 'Ambinder, R F', 'Flinn, I W']","['Kasamon YL', 'Jones RJ', 'Brodsky RA', 'Fuchs EJ', 'Matsui W', 'Luznik L', 'Powell JD', 'Blackford AL', 'Goodrich A', 'Gocke CD', 'Abrams RA', 'Ambinder RF', 'Flinn IW']","['Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins, Baltimore, MD, USA.

Of the cell lines studied, HL60 proved to be the most sensitive to each of the differentiation-inducing agents when compared to THP-1, NB-4 and U-937 cell lines. Three of the VDAs tested (PRI-1906, PRI-2191 and PRI-2201) were similarly effective as 1,25D in all the cell lines tested. However, blast cells from AML showed a varying sensitivity towards 1,25D. For example, blast cells isolated from patients in which the whole or part of chromosome 7 was deleted were extremely sensitive to 1,25D and its analogs. In contrast, 1,25D failed to increase the expression of differentiation markers in blast cells isolated from patients carrying activating mutations in Flt3 gene. Since, the expression of vitamin D receptor (VDR) in cells with Flt3 mutations was increased to the same extent as in other AML cells this suggests that failure of these cells to differentiate lies downstream of the receptor. That blast cells with different cytogenetic abnormalities have dissimilar responses to 1,25D and its analogs, may have implications in the use of 1,25D as a 'differentiation therapy' for myeloid leukemias. The analog PRI-2191 (tacalcitol) was found to be the most potent in inducing patient's cells differentiation.","['Gocek, Elzbieta', 'Kielbinski, Marek', 'Baurska, Hanna', 'Haus, Olga', 'Kutner, Andrzej', 'Marcinkowska, Ewa']","['Gocek E', 'Kielbinski M', 'Baurska H', 'Haus O', 'Kutner A', 'Marcinkowska E']","['Department of Biotechnology, University of Wroclaw, Tamka 2, 50-137 Wroclaw, Poland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091031,England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,,2009/11/03 06:00,2010/04/24 06:00,['2009/11/03 06:00'],"['2009/06/01 00:00 [received]', '2009/09/12 00:00 [revised]', '2009/10/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/11/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/24 06:00 [medline]']","['S0145-2126(09)00497-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2009.10.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2010 May;34(5):649-57. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2009.10.004.

We studied whether place of residence (rural versus urban) is associated with clinical outcomes of patients with leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) who received an unrelated donor hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Patients' residential ZIP code at the time of transplant was used to determine rural or urban designation based on the Rural Urban Commuting Codes. The study included 6140 patients reported to the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) from 121 U.S. HCT centers: 1179 (19%) came from rural areas, whereas 4961 (81%) came from urban areas. Rural and urban patients were similar in patient-, disease-, and transplant-related characteristics aside from household income and distance traveled to the HCT center. After adjusting for income and other significant patient, disease, and transplant-related variables, the risk of overall mortality between patients residing in rural and urban areas were not statistically significant (relative risk 1.01, 95% confidence intervals 0.93-1.10, P = .74). Similar outcomes were noted for treatment-related mortality (TRM), disease-free survival (DFS), and relapse. Patient's income, derived from the U.S. Census and based on their residential ZIP code, was independently associated with outcomes. In summary, our study showed no differences in the clinical outcomes of patients from rural or urban areas after unrelated donor HCT.","['Loberiza, Fausto R Jr', 'Lee, Stephanie J', 'Klein, John P', 'Hassebroek, Anna', 'Dehn, Jason G', 'Frangoul, Haydar A', 'Hahn, Theresa', 'Hale, Gregory', 'Lazarus, Hillard M', 'LeMaistre, Charles F', 'Maziarz, Richard T', 'Rizzo, J Douglas', 'Majhail, Navneet S']","['Loberiza FR Jr', 'Lee SJ', 'Klein JP', 'Hassebroek A', 'Dehn JG', 'Frangoul HA', 'Hahn T', 'Hale G', 'Lazarus HM', 'LeMaistre CF', 'Maziarz RT', 'Rizzo JD', 'Majhail NS']","['Section of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Nebraska Medical Center, 987680 Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE 68198-7680, USA. floberiza@unmc.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",20091030,United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,PMC2822013,2009/11/03 06:00,2010/05/29 06:00,['2009/11/03 06:00'],"['2009/10/05 00:00 [received]', '2009/10/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/11/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/29 06:00 [medline]']","['S1083-8791(09)00499-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbmt.2009.10.028 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2010 Mar;16(3):368-75. doi: 10.1016/j.bbmt.2009.10.028.

This study was conducted to determine how repeated exposure to cocaine phosphorylates B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 2 (Bcl2), which may be responsible for the regulation of behavioral alterations in the rat dorsal striatum. The results revealed that repeated systemic injections of cocaine (20 mg/kg) once a day for 7 consecutive days increased the phosphorylation of Bcl2 at serine 70 (Bcl2-S70). However, this increase was reduced by the blockade of dopamine D1 receptors, group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs), and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. In addition, elevation of behavioral locomotor activity after repeated exposure to cocaine was partially reduced by the inhibition of Bcl2. These data suggest that stimulation of dopamine D1 receptors, group I mGluRs, and NMDA receptors following repeated cocaine administration is necessary for the induction of Bcl2-S70 phosphorylation, which contributes to the expression of behavioral sensitization.","['Ahn, Sung Min', 'Jang, Dong Hye', 'Choe, Eun Sang']","['Ahn SM', 'Jang DH', 'Choe ES']","['Department of Biological Sciences, Pusan National University, 30 Jangjeon-dong, Kumjeong-gu, Pusan 609-735, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091030,Ireland,Neurosci Lett,Neuroscience letters,7600130,,2009/11/03 06:00,2010/03/05 06:00,['2009/11/03 06:00'],"['2009/09/09 00:00 [received]', '2009/10/24 00:00 [revised]', '2009/10/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/11/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/05 06:00 [medline]']","['S0304-3940(09)01439-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.neulet.2009.10.082 [doi]']",ppublish,Neurosci Lett. 2010 Jan 4;468(2):125-9. doi: 10.1016/j.neulet.2009.10.082.

The LIF gene is located on 22q12.1-q12.2, a hot spot for schizophrenia. Three polymorphisms of the LIF gene (rs929271, rs737812, and rs929273) were examined in a case-control association study of 390 patients with schizophrenia and 410 age- and sex-matched controls. Effects of a risk genotype of LIF on cognitive domains were evaluated by the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised, Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised, and Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) in 355 healthy volunteers. The LIF gene showed significant associations with schizophrenia at rs929271 and a haplotype consisting of rs929271-rs737812. After stratification by subtype of schizophrenia, the hebephrenic, but not paranoid, type was associated with the LIF gene at rs929271 (allele, P=0.014) and the haplotype (permutation P=0.013). Having the T-allele and T-carrier genotypes (TT and TG) of rs929271 were risks for hebephrenic schizophrenia, and the odds ratios were 1.38 (95% CI: 1.21-1.56) and 1.54 (95%CI: 1.19-1.98), respectively. Subjects with T-carrier genotypes made significantly more errors on the WCST compared with those without (P=0.04).

Prior to implantation, the blastocyst must hatch out of its acellular glycoprotein coat, the zona pellucida (ZP). The phenomenon of blastocyst hatching is believed to be regulated by (i) dynamic cellular components such as actin-based trophectodermal projections (TEPs), and (ii) a variety of autocrine and paracrine molecules such as growth factors, cytokines and proteases. The spatio-temporal regulation of zona lysis by blastocyst-derived cellular and molecular signaling factors is being keenly investigated. Our studies show that hamster blastocyst hatching is accelerated by growth factors such as heparin binding-epidermal growth factor and leukemia inhibitory factor and that embryo-derived, cysteine proteases including cathepsins are responsible for blastocyst hatching. Additionally, we believe that cyclooxygenase-generated prostaglandins, estradiol-17beta mediated estrogen receptor-alpha signaling and possibly NFkappaB could be involved in peri-hatching development. Moreover, we show that TEPs are intimately involved with lysing ZP and that the TEPs potentially enrich and harbor hatching-enabling factors. These observations provide new insights into our understanding of the key cellular and molecular regulators involved in the phenomenon of mammalian blastocyst hatching, which is essential for the establishment of early pregnancy.","['Seshagiri, Polani B', 'Sen Roy, Shubhendu', 'Sireesha, Garimella', 'Rao, Rajnish P']","['Seshagiri PB', 'Sen Roy S', 'Sireesha G', 'Rao RP']","['Department of Molecular Reproduction, Development and Genetics, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, India. polani@mrdg.iisc.ernet.in']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20091030,Ireland,J Reprod Immunol,Journal of reproductive immunology,8001906,,2009/11/03 06:00,2010/06/09 06:00,['2009/11/03 06:00'],"['2009/03/11 00:00 [received]', '2009/05/07 00:00 [revised]', '2009/06/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/11/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/09 06:00 [medline]']","['S0165-0378(09)00473-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jri.2009.06.264 [doi]']",ppublish,J Reprod Immunol. 2009 Dec;83(1-2):79-84. doi: 10.1016/j.jri.2009.06.264.

The infection is endemic in subtropical areas of Latin America and has a high prevalence in Brazil. The disease is acquired by airborne inhalation of conidia and is frequently observed in adult male rural workers. The juvenile type of this mycosis is less prevalent (5-10% of clinical cases) and attacks both sexes. This clinical form occurs in children and adolescents and has a subacute course with fever, toxemia, loss of weight, adenopathy, hepatoesplenomegaly, anaemia and eosinophilia. Radiologic abnormalities in the lung fields may be seen. Mucous membrane lesions occasionally occur. The clinical presentation resembles severe tuberculosis, leukaemia or lymphoma. The diagnosis is confirmed by finding yeast-like elements of P. brasiliensis in microscopic examinations of wet preparations of specimens submitted for mycologic studies. The fungus grows slowly (20-30 days) and its isolation is difficult. Histologic and serologic studies may also assist in the diagnosis of this mycosis. Sulfonamides, ketoconazole, itraconazole, fluconazole and amphotericin B have been successfully used in the treatment of paracoccidioidomycosis. Itraconazole is the treatment of choice, being effective in more than 95% of cases.

Although, T. gondii antibodies have been reported in several species of wild felids, little is known of the epidemiology and risk factors associated with T. gondii infection in wild cats. The Iberian lynx (Lynx pardinus) is the most endangered felid species in the world. In the present study, seroprevalence and associated risk factors for T. gondii infection in a large population of Iberian lynx in Spain were determined. Serum samples from 129 Iberian lynx collected from 2005 to 2009 and 85 wild rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus), sharing the habitat with the Iberian lynx, were tested for antibodies to T. gondii by the modified agglutination test (MAT) using a cut-off value of 1:25. Antibodies to T. gondii were found in 81 of 129 (62.8%) Iberian lynx. Seroprevalence to T. gondii in Iberian lynx significantly increased with age (P<0.001). T. gondii seroprevalences were similar in free-ranging (66.7% of 93) and wild-caught captive lynx (69% of 84) but significantly lower in captive-born lynx (22.5% of 40). Seroprevalence was higher in lynx with concurrent Cytauxzoonfelis (88% of 25) but not with concurrent Feline Leukemia Virus (FeLV) infection (53.8% of 13). There were no significant differences in seroprevalence between sexes, geographic region and year of sample collection (2005-2009). Oocysts of T. gondii were not detected microscopically in fecal samples from 58 lynx. Wild rabbits are considered the most important food for the lynx. Antibodies to T. gondii were found in 14 (11.9%) of 85 rabbits tested. The present results indicate that T. gondii infection is widespread in the two areas where Iberian lynx survive in Spain. The fact that four captive-born lynx seroconverted was indication of contact with T. gondii also in the Captive Breeding Centers, hence, control measures to prevent T. gondii infection would be necessary in these centers.","['Garcia-Bocanegra, I', 'Dubey, J P', 'Martinez, F', 'Vargas, A', 'Cabezon, O', 'Zorrilla, I', 'Arenas, A', 'Almeria, S']","['Garcia-Bocanegra I', 'Dubey JP', 'Martinez F', 'Vargas A', 'Cabezon O', 'Zorrilla I', 'Arenas A', 'Almeria S']","['Departamento de Sanidad Animal, Facultad de Veterinaria, UCO, Campus Universitarios de Rabanales, 14071 Cordoba, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090930,Netherlands,Vet Parasitol,Veterinary parasitology,7602745,,2009/11/03 06:00,2010/04/30 06:00,['2009/11/03 06:00'],"['2009/07/15 00:00 [received]', '2009/08/26 00:00 [revised]', '2009/09/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/11/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/30 06:00 [medline]']","['S0304-4017(09)00577-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.vetpar.2009.09.044 [doi]']",ppublish,Vet Parasitol. 2010 Jan 20;167(1):36-42. doi: 10.1016/j.vetpar.2009.09.044.

On univariate analysis, patients with mutated FLT3 were less likely to achieve a CR to first salvage compared to FLT3-WT patients (24% vs. 41%; P=0.09). Furthermore, survival was longer for the FLT3-WT patients achieving a second CR after salvage compared to FLT3-mutated patients (P=0.017).

However, such mutations impair myeloid programming of HSCs and block myeloid lineage commitment when homozygous. In contrast, N-terminal C/EBPalpha mutations are silent with regards to HSC expansion, but allow the formation of committed myeloid progenitors, the templates for leukemia-initiating cells. The combination of N- and C-terminal C/EBPalpha mutations incorporates both features, accelerating disease development and explaining the clinical prevalence of this configuration of CEBPA mutations.","['Bereshchenko, Oxana', 'Mancini, Elena', 'Moore, Susan', 'Bilbao, Daniel', 'Mansson, Robert', 'Luc, Sidinh', 'Grover, Amit', 'Jacobsen, Sten Eirik W', 'Bryder, David', 'Nerlov, Claus']","['Bereshchenko O', 'Mancini E', 'Moore S', 'Bilbao D', 'Mansson R', 'Luc S', 'Grover A', 'Jacobsen SE', 'Bryder D', 'Nerlov C']","['EMBL Mouse Biology Unit, Via Ramarini 32, 00015 Monterotondo, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cancer Cell,Cancer cell,101130617,,2009/11/03 06:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/11/03 06:00'],"['2009/04/16 00:00 [received]', '2009/09/29 00:00 [revised]', '2009/09/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/11/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S1535-6108(09)00344-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ccr.2009.09.036 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Cell. 2009 Nov 6;16(5):390-400. doi: 10.1016/j.ccr.2009.09.036.,5,IM,"['Animals', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha/*genetics', 'Cell Cycle/physiology', 'Cell Growth Processes/physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics/*pathology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout']",,['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha)'],,,['G0900892/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, assays with read-out for changes in CD86 expression and CXCL8 secretion were compared with a novel functional assay based on the in vitro migratory behaviour of LC. In all three assays LC derived from the human myeloid-leukaemia-cell-line MUTZ-3 (MUTZ-LC) were used. Exposure of MUTZ-LC to a panel of five sensitizers and three non-sensitizers resulted in increased CD86 expression in only 3/5 sensitizers, but also in 1/3 non-sensitizers. In contrast, CXCL8 secretion was uniformly increased after exposure to all sensitizers, but not after exposure to non-sensitizers. In a transwell migration assay, preferential migration of sensitizer-exposed MUTZ-LC towards CXCL12 was observed (5/5 sensitizers), whereas non-sensitizer-exposed MUTZ-LC only migrated towards CCL5 (3/3 non-sensitizers). In conclusion, the novel MUTZ-LC migration assay and analysis of CXCL8 secretion proved to be more successful than analysis of CD86 in predicting sensitizers from non-sensitizers and therefore warrant further investigation in the field of in vitro assay development.","['Ouwehand, Krista', 'Spiekstra, Sander W', 'Reinders, Judith', 'Scheper, Rik J', 'de Gruijl, Tanja D', 'Gibbs, Susan']","['Ouwehand K', 'Spiekstra SW', 'Reinders J', 'Scheper RJ', 'de Gruijl TD', 'Gibbs S']","['Department of Dermatology, VU University Medical Centre, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091028,England,Toxicol In Vitro,Toxicology in vitro : an international journal published in association with BIBRA,8712158,,2009/11/03 06:00,2010/06/03 06:00,['2009/11/03 06:00'],"['2009/03/18 00:00 [received]', '2009/10/20 00:00 [revised]', '2009/10/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/11/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/03 06:00 [medline]']","['S0887-2333(09)00323-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.tiv.2009.10.014 [doi]']",ppublish,Toxicol In Vitro. 2010 Mar;24(2):578-85. doi: 10.1016/j.tiv.2009.10.014.

Many ingredients of cosmetic formulations are potentially causes of skin inflammation and sensibilization. Since cytotoxicity is known, among other factors, to trigger irritation, in an alternative model for evaluation of skin irritation, it can be considered also the precocious release of inflammatory mediators, i.e. cytokines, originating mainly from keratinocytes. In this in vitro study we have analysed some parameters directly or indirectly related to irritation/inflammation, in NCTC 2544 human keratinocytes during short-time exposure to some potential irritants cosmetic fragrances, included in the European Laws 2003/15/EEC. IIC50 was extrapolated by MTT and NRU viability indexes after exposure of cell ultures to Geraniol Limonene and Benzylic Alcohol for 1, 3 and 6h. NCTC cells were then exposed to sub-toxic doses of selected compounds and interleukin-1alpha (IL-1alpha) and leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) expressions were analysed as early proinflammatory cytokines. To our knowledge our findings demonstrated for the first time that NCTC cells synthesize and modulate LIF after exposure to selected irritating stimuli. Moreover, our results give evidence on LIF role as in vitro precocious endpoint for the assessment of the risk in cosmetic field, because its response under irritation stimuli is very quick and comparable to IL-1alpha.","['Parodi, Alessandro', 'Sanguineti, Roberta', 'Catalano, Mariafrancesca', 'Penco, Susanna', 'Pronzato, Maria Adelaide', 'Scanarotti, Chiara', 'Bassi, Anna Maria']","['Parodi A', 'Sanguineti R', 'Catalano M', 'Penco S', 'Pronzato MA', 'Scanarotti C', 'Bassi AM']","['Department of Experimental Medicine, University of Genova, Genova, Italy. aleparodi1978@libero.it']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091028,Netherlands,Toxicol Lett,Toxicology letters,7709027,,2009/11/03 06:00,2010/02/27 06:00,['2009/11/03 06:00'],"['2009/08/25 00:00 [received]', '2009/10/10 00:00 [revised]', '2009/10/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/11/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/27 06:00 [medline]']","['S0378-4274(09)01454-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.toxlet.2009.10.013 [doi]']",ppublish,Toxicol Lett. 2010 Feb 1;192(2):101-7. doi: 10.1016/j.toxlet.2009.10.013.

Patients with CML can now expect excellent long-term survival, often without major side effects. In most patients, however, residual leukemic burden remains detectable using a sensitive reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction method. In addition, many patients undergoing imatinib therapy will either not respond or lose their response over time because of resistance or intolerance. The introduction of second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) re-establishes response in approximately half of these patients. Several agents are being developed for treating patients who experience suboptimal response to second-generation TKIs and for those who develop resistance caused by the emergence of highly resistant BCR-ABL1 mutations.

Exposure estimates were updated and an exposure estimate validation study as well as dose-response modeling were conducted by these researchers. This information was not available to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency when it prepared its health assessment of 1,3-butadiene in 2002. An extensive analysis conducted by TCEQ discusses dose-response modeling, estimating risk for the general population from occupational workers, estimating risk for potentially sensitive subpopulations, effect of occupational exposure estimation error, and use of mortality rates to predict incidence. The URF is 5.0 x 10(-7) per microg/m(3) or 1.1 x 10(-6) per ppb and is based on a Cox regression dose-response model using restricted continuous data with age as a covariate, and a linear low-dose extrapolation default approach using the 95% lower confidence limit as the point of departure. Age-dependent adjustment factors were applied to account for possible increased susceptibility for early life exposure. The air concentration at 1 in 100,000 excess leukemia mortality, the no-significant-risk level, is 20 microg/m(3) (9.1 ppb), which is slightly lower than the TCEQ chronic reference value of 33 microg/m(3) (15 ppb) protective of ovarian atrophy. These values will be used to evaluate ambient air monitoring data so the general public is protected against adverse health effects from chronic exposure to 1,3-butadiene.","['Grant, Roberta L', 'Haney, Joseph', 'Curry, Angela L', 'Honeycutt, Michael']","['Grant RL', 'Haney J', 'Curry AL', 'Honeycutt M']","['Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, Toxicology Division, P.O.

Dexamethasone exhibited different effects based on the concentration used. Indeed, while at 10(-7) M dexamethasone reduced the number of mature osteoclasts, at 10(-8) M showed no significant effects and at 10(-9) M significantly increased the number of mature osteoclasts, with respect to cells cultured with only M-CSF + RANKL. On the other hand, the addition in culture of recombinant TRAIL inhibited the output of mature osteoclasts induced by M-CSF + RANKL. However, the presence of dexamethasone (10(-8) or 10(-9) M) into the culture medium significantly counteracted the anti-osteoclastic activity of TRAIL. In order to ascertain whether dexamethasone, might also interfere with the anti-leukemic activity of TRAIL, the degree of apoptosis induced by TRAIL was evaluated in several myeloid (OCI, MOLM, HL-60) and lymphoid (SKW6.4, MAVER, BJAB) leukemic cell lines. The levels of TRAIL-triggered apoptosis were not significantly different between leukemic cells cultured in the absence or presence of dexamethasone. Concerning the molecular mechanism mediating the dexamethasone-suppression of the TRAIL activity in pre-osteoclasts, but not in leukemic cells, we found that dexamethasone induced a significant down-regulation of the surface levels of TRAIL-R2 in cells of the osteoclastic lineage but not in leukemic cells. The ability of dexamethasone to counteract the TRAIL pathway envisions a novel mechanism mediating the pro-osteoclastic activity of dexamethasone in vivo.","['Zauli, Giorgio', 'Rimondi, Erika', 'Celeghini, Claudio', 'Milani, Daniela', 'Secchiero, Paola']","['Zauli G', 'Rimondi E', 'Celeghini C', 'Milani D', 'Secchiero P']","['Department of Morphology and Embryology, University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,,2009/10/31 06:00,2009/12/18 06:00,['2009/10/31 06:00'],"['2009/10/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jcp.21960 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 2010 Feb;222(2):357-64. doi: 10.1002/jcp.21960.,2,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Lineage/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Dexamethasone/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Down-Regulation', 'Glucocorticoids/*pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/metabolism/*pathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/metabolism', 'Osteoblasts/*drug effects/metabolism', 'RANK Ligand/pharmacology', 'Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/drug effects/metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/*pharmacology', 'Time Factors']",,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (RANK Ligand)', '0 (Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '81627-83-0 (Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']","['(c) 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although there has been significant improvement in the survival of patients with multiple myeloma (MM) over the past few decades, it is not known whether there has been a similar trend for PCL. METHODS: The authors analyzed the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database to evaluate the characteristics and survival of patients who had PCL compared with those of patients who had MM. RESULTS: Among 291 patients with PCL, the median age was 67 years (range, 19-98 years), the distribution of men and women was nearly equal, and the majority of patients were white (79.4%). The median overall survival (OS) was 4 months and the median disease-specific survival (DSS) was 6 months for patients with PCL; the 1-year, 2-year, and 5-year OS rates were 27.8%, 14.1%, and 6.4%, respectively. There were no survival differences noted according to sex or race. Patients aged<60 years were found to have a better median OS compared with patients aged>or=60 years (median OS, 7 months vs 3 months; P=.007), although the 5-year OS was equally poor in both groups (6.3% vs 6.4%, respectively). During the same period, 49,106 patients with MM were identified. Unlike MM, in which there has been a modest but statistically significant improvement in OS and DSS noted over time, no significant improvement was evident for PCL. CONCLUSIONS: The poor long-term outcome and the lack of survival improvement in PCL suggest the need for better therapeutic options for these patients.","['Ramsingh, Giridharan', 'Mehan, Paul', 'Luo, Jingqin', 'Vij, Ravi', 'Morgensztern, Daniel']","['Ramsingh G', 'Mehan P', 'Luo J', 'Vij R', 'Morgensztern D']","['Division of Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri 63110, USA. gramsing@dom.wustl.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,2009/10/31 06:00,2010/02/03 06:00,['2009/10/31 06:00'],"['2009/10/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.24700 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2009 Dec 15;115(24):5734-9. doi: 10.1002/cncr.24700.,24,IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Plasma Cell/epidemiology/*mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Analysis']",,,['Copyright (c) 2009 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Over a 6-month period, 65 patients (34 affected by a solid tumor, 31 by a hematological disorder) were enrolled. Serum PCT concentrations were measured by an automated immunoassay on the leucocytes nadir and on the third day, when patients were checked for any sign of infection. RESULTS: Procalcitonin values were not affected by gender, age, therapeutic approach, use of G-CSF or performance status and did not differ between patients who subsequently developed a localized infection and those who did not. PCT concentrations resulted higher in patients affected by hematological disorders than in those affected by solid tumors (mean value 0.09 vs. 0.05 microg/L; p < 0.0015) and in those who were hospitalized than in the outpatient group (0.10 vs. 0.05 microg/L; p < 0.0013). PCT levels correlated with the type of neoplastic disease (p = 0.016), the highest concentrations being detected in patients affected by acute leukemia. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that PCT is not a useful predictive marker of infection in oncohematologic neutropenic patients, even though higher serum PCT concentrations are associated with hematological tumors as well as in-hospital admission.","['Carnino, Luisa', 'Betteto, Silvia', 'Loiacono, Maria', 'Chiappella, Annalisa', 'Giacobino, Alice', 'Ciuffreda, Libero', 'Lista, Patrizia', 'Mengozzi, Giulio']","['Carnino L', 'Betteto S', 'Loiacono M', 'Chiappella A', 'Giacobino A', 'Ciuffreda L', 'Lista P', 'Mengozzi G']","['Oncohematological Center, San Giovanni Battista University Hospital, Turin, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20091030,Germany,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol,Journal of cancer research and clinical oncology,7902060,,2009/10/31 06:00,2010/05/15 06:00,['2009/10/31 06:00'],"['2009/05/02 00:00 [received]', '2009/10/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/10/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00432-009-0699-9 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol. 2010 Apr;136(4):611-5. doi: 10.1007/s00432-009-0699-9.

The ""minor"" breakpoint in Ph+ ALL encodes p185(BCR/ABL) from der22 and p96(ABL/BCR) from der9. The ""major"" breakpoint in CML encodes p210(BCR/ABL) and p40(ABL/BCR). Herein, we investigated the leukemogenic potential of the der9-associated p96(ABL/BCR) and p40(ABL/BCR) fusion proteins and their roles in the lineage commitment of hematopoietic stem cells in comparison to BCR/ABL. METHODOLOGY: All t(9;22) derived proteins were retrovirally expressed in murine hematopoietic stem cells (SL cells) and human umbilical cord blood cells (UCBC). Stem cell potential was determined by replating efficiency, colony forming--spleen and competitive repopulating assays. The leukemic potential of the ABL/BCR fusion proteins was assessed by in a transduction/transplantation model. Effects on the lineage commitment and differentiation were investigated by culturing the cells under conditions driving either myeloid or lymphoid commitment. Expression of key factors of the B-cell differentiation and components of the preB-cell receptor were determined by qRT-PCR. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Both p96(ABL/BCR) and p40(ABL/BCR) increased proliferation of early progenitors and the short term stem cell capacity of SL-cells and exhibited own leukemogenic potential. Interestingly, BCR/ABL gave origin exclusively to a myeloid phenotype independently from the culture conditions whereas p96(ABL/BCR) and to a minor extent p40(ABL/BCR) forced the B-cell commitment of SL-cells and UCBC. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our here presented data establish the reciprocal ABL/BCR fusion proteins as second oncogenes encoded by the t(9;22) in addition to BCR/ABL and suggest that ABL/BCR contribute to the determination of the leukemic phenotype through their influence on the lineage commitment.","['Zheng, Xiaomin', 'Oancea, Claudia', 'Henschler, Reinhard', 'Moore, Malcolm A S', 'Ruthardt, Martin']","['Zheng X', 'Oancea C', 'Henschler R', 'Moore MA', 'Ruthardt M']","['Department of Hematology, Laboratory for Tumor Stem Cell Biology, Goethe University, Frankfurt, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091030,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,PMC2764858,2009/10/31 06:00,2010/03/13 06:00,['2009/10/31 06:00'],"['2009/07/07 00:00 [received]', '2009/10/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/10/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1371/journal.pone.0007661 [doi]'],epublish,PLoS One. 2009 Oct 30;4(10):e7661. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0007661.,10,IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/*cytology', 'Cell Differentiation', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 22', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9', 'Fetal Blood/cytology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'Stem Cells/cytology', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'U937 Cells']",,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study we report that 53BP1 aggregates in nuclear foci within syncytia elicited by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 envelope. 53BP1 aggregation occurs as a consequence of nuclear fusion (karyogamy (KG)). It colocalizes partially with the promyelomonocytic leukemia protein (PML), and the ataxia telangiectasia mutated kinase (ATM), the two components of the DDR that mediate apoptosis induced by the HIV-1 envelope. ATM-dependent phosphorylation of 53BP1 on serines 25 and 1778 (53BP1S25P and 53BP1S1778P) occurs at these DNA damage foci. 53BP1S25P was also detected in syncytia present in the lymph nodes or frontal brain sections from HIV-1-infected carriers, as well as in peripheral blood mononucleated cells from HIV-1-infected individuals, correlating with viral load. Knockdown of 53BP1 caused HIV-1 envelope-induced syncytia to enter abnormal mitoses, leading to their selective destruction through mitochondrion-dependent and caspase-dependent pathways. In conclusion, depletion of 53BP1 triggers the demise of HIV-1-elicited syncytia through mitotic catastrophe.","['Perfettini, J-L', 'Nardacci, R', 'Seror, C', 'Raza, S Q', 'Sepe, S', 'Saidi, H', 'Brottes, F', 'Amendola, A', 'Subra, F', 'Del Nonno, F', 'Chessa, L', ""D'Incecco, A"", 'Gougeon, M-L', 'Piacentini, M', 'Kroemer, G']","['Perfettini JL', 'Nardacci R', 'Seror C', 'Raza SQ', 'Sepe S', 'Saidi H', 'Brottes F', 'Amendola A', 'Subra F', 'Del Nonno F', 'Chessa L', ""D'Incecco A"", 'Gougeon ML', 'Piacentini M', 'Kroemer G']","['INSERM U, Villejuif, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091030,England,Cell Death Differ,Cell death and differentiation,9437445,,2009/10/31 06:00,2010/06/29 06:00,['2009/10/31 06:00'],"['2009/10/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/29 06:00 [medline]']","['cdd2009159 [pii]', '10.1038/cdd.2009.159 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Death Differ. 2010 May;17(5):811-20. doi: 10.1038/cdd.2009.159.

Accurate and rapid detection of these abnormalities is mandatory, which is achieved by karyotyping, fluorescence in situ hybridization, and real time quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR). For cost-effective diagnostic approaches knowledge of diagnostic accuracy of these tests is required. Therefore, we aimed to determine the diagnostic accuracy of karyotyping, fluorescence in situ hybridization, and RQ-PCR analysis. PROCEDURE: Retrospective study conducted between January 1, 1992 and January 1, 2007 in the Emma Children Hospital in Amsterdam. All consecutive patients under 18 years with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia were included. Diagnostic tests were performed according to international standards. RESULTS: Diagnostic techniques show a high-reciprocal agreement and have a high-individual diagnostic accuracy in detecting the above-mentioned chromosomal translocations. However, the sensitivity of karyotyping for detecting the TEL-AML1 fusion gene and the sensitivity of RQ-PCR for detecting MLL-rearrangements was rather low. CONCLUSIONS: Diagnostic accuracy of tests for detecting t(9;22), t(12;21), and t(11q23) is generally high, although sensitivity is not optimal for all anomalies. Despite the high-diagnostic accuracy, all diagnostic techniques should be used complementary, because any detection of a (significant) chromosomal aberration irrespective of diagnostic mode has to be considered in therapy.","['Olde Nordkamp, Louise', 'Mellink, Clemens', 'van der Schoot, Ellen', 'van den Berg, Henk']","['Olde Nordkamp L', 'Mellink C', 'van der Schoot E', 'van den Berg H']","['Department of Paediatric Oncology, Emma Children Hospital AMC, University of Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",,United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,,2009/10/31 06:00,2010/01/08 06:00,['2009/10/31 06:00'],"['2009/10/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/MPH.0b013e3181bc9c85 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2009 Dec;31(12):930-5. doi: 10.1097/MPH.0b013e3181bc9c85.,12,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence/*methods', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Karyotyping', 'Male', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/*genetics', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Translocation, Genetic/genetics']",,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (MLL-AF4 fusion protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (TEL-AML1 fusion protein)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Combotox is a 1:1 mixture of RFB4-dgA and HD37-dgA which are immunotoxins that target the CD22 and CD19 antigens, respectively. Combotox has different toxicities and targets than chemotherapy and is, thus, a new candidate for the treatment of patients with relapsed ALL. Preclinical data have demonstrated which Combotox is effective in killing pre-B-ALL cell lines and cells from patients with pre-B ALL. METHODS: We designed and conducted a Phase 1 dose-escalation study using Combotox in children with refractory or relapsed B-lineage-ALL. Seventeen patients aged 1 to 16 years were enrolled in this multi-institution study. They were treated at 4-dose levels: 2 mg/m2, 4 mg/m2, 5 mg/m2, and 6 mg/m2. RESULTS: The maximum tolerated dose was 5 mg/m2 and graft versus host disease defined the maximum tolerated dose. Three patients experienced complete remission. Six additional patients experienced a decrease of >95% in their peripheral blood blast counts, and 1 patient experienced a decrease of 75%. CONCLUSIONS: Combotox can be safely administered to children with refractory leukemia. It has clinically important anticancer activity as a single agent. The recommended dose for future studies is 5 mg/m2/dose.","['Herrera, Larry', 'Bostrom, Bruce', 'Gore, Lisa', 'Sandler, Eric', 'Lew, Glen', 'Schlegel, Paul G', 'Aquino, Victor', 'Ghetie, Victor', 'Vitetta, Ellen S', 'Schindler, John']","['Herrera L', 'Bostrom B', 'Gore L', 'Sandler E', 'Lew G', 'Schlegel PG', 'Aquino V', 'Ghetie V', 'Vitetta ES', 'Schindler J']","['Temple University, Philadelphia, PA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,,2009/10/31 06:00,2010/01/08 06:00,['2009/10/31 06:00'],"['2009/10/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/MPH.0b013e3181bdf211 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2009 Dec;31(12):936-41. doi: 10.1097/MPH.0b013e3181bdf211.,12,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/therapeutic use', 'Antigens, CD19/immunology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunotoxins/*therapeutic use', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*drug therapy/immunology/pathology', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/immunology/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Ricin/*therapeutic use', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 2/immunology', 'Treatment Outcome']",,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (CD22 protein, human)', '0 (Immunotoxins)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 2)', '9009-86-3 (Ricin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods, materials and patients: The current study investigated the impact of four vascular endothelial growth factor type A (VEGFA) and three vascular endothelial growth factor receptor type 2 (VEGFR2) gene polymorphisms on the outcomes of 228 CML patients following imatinib therapy. VEGFA genotypes such as -2578C>A (rs699947), -460T>C (rs833061), +405G>C (rs2010963) and +936C>T (rs3025039) loci and VEGFR2 genotypes (rs1531289, rs1870377 and rs2305948) were analyzed using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight-based method. RESULTS: In single marker analyses, strong correlations were noted between complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) and VEGFR2 genotypes (rs1531289/rs1870377), between treatment failure and VEGFR2 genotype (rs1870377) and between progression to advanced disease and VEGFA genotypes (rs699947/rs833061). Three haplotypes of VEGFR2 gene were generated as follows: GT (46.1%), AT (27.9%) and GA (25.7%). Haplotype analyses showed good correlations between VEGFR2 haplotype and CCyR and treatment failure to imatinib. Multivariate analyses confirmed strong correlations of VEGFR2 polymorphisms (especially rs1531289, rs1870377 or VEGFR2 haplotype) with CCyR, treatment failure and of VEGFA genotype (rs699947) with progression to advanced disease. CONCLUSION: The VEGFR2 gene polymorphism correlates with cytogenetic response, treatment failure following imatinib therapy for CML, while VEGFA genotype correlates with progression to advanced disease.","['Kim, D H', 'Xu, W', 'Kamel-Reid, S', 'Liu, X', 'Jung, C W', 'Kim, S', 'Lipton, J H']","['Kim DH', 'Xu W', 'Kamel-Reid S', 'Liu X', 'Jung CW', 'Kim S', 'Lipton JH']","['Department of Hematology/Medical Oncology, Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia Group, Princess Margaret Hospital, University Health Network, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada; Department of Hematology/Oncology, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.

METHODS: The (64)Cu-RGD radiotracer was evaluated in the transgenic mouse expressing Tax (Tax(+)), which spontaneously develops osteolytic tumors throughout the vertebrae and hind limbs, using biodistribution studies and small-animal PET/CT. Histologic analysis was also performed on Tax(+) mouse tails, using hematoxylin and eosin and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase to confirm the presence of osteolytic bone lesions and the presence of osteoclasts, respectively. Additionally, a proof-of-principle study was conducted with a small group of Tax(+) animals presenting with osteolytic lesions. These animals were treated with the bisphosphonate zoledronic acid and imaged with (64)Cu-RGD to determine whether this radiopharmaceutical was sensitive enough to detect a response to the bisphosphonate therapy. RESULTS: Biodistribution studies using (64)Cu-RGD demonstrated that Tax(+) mice between the ages of 6 and 12 mo had a greater accumulation of activity in their tail vertebrae than did the wild-type (WT) cohort (P = 0.013). Additionally, Tax(+) mice between the ages of 6 and 12 mo had significantly more tracer activity associated with their tail vertebrae than did Tax(+) mice older than 12 mo (P = 0.003), suggesting that earlier bone metastases cause an increased recruitment of alpha(v)beta(3)-expressing cells. Small-animal PET/CT with (64)Cu-RGD was conducted on Tax(+) and WT mice. On the basis of standardized uptake value analysis, Tax(+) mice had approximately 2-fold more tail-associated activity than did WT animals (P = 0.0157). Additionally, decreases in uptake were observed in the tails of Tax(+) mice after treatment with the osteoclast inhibitor zoledronic acid, and histologic analysis of Tax(+) mouse-tail vertebrae revealed the presence of Tax(+) tumor cells, osteoclasts, and proinflammatory cells within the bone microenvironment. CONCLUSION: Together, these data suggest that (64)Cu-RGD has the potential to effectively image osteolytic bone metastases and monitor the physiologic changes in the bone metastatic microenvironment after osteoclast-inhibiting bisphosphonate therapy.","['Wadas, Thaddeus J', 'Deng, Hongju', 'Sprague, Jennifer E', 'Zheleznyak, Alexander', 'Weilbaecher, Katherine N', 'Anderson, Carolyn J']","['Wadas TJ', 'Deng H', 'Sprague JE', 'Zheleznyak A', 'Weilbaecher KN', 'Anderson CJ']","['Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri 63110, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",,United States,J Nucl Med,"Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",0217410,PMC2836828,2009/10/31 06:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/10/31 06:00'],"['2009/10/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['50/11/1873 [pii]', '10.2967/jnumed.109.067140 [doi]']",ppublish,J Nucl Med. 2009 Nov;50(11):1873-80. doi: 10.2967/jnumed.109.067140.,11,IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Neoplasms/complications/*diagnosis/metabolism/*secondary', 'Copper Radioisotopes/chemistry', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Diphosphonates/therapeutic use', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Products, tax/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/diagnosis', 'Mice', 'Multiple Myeloma/diagnosis', 'Oligopeptides/chemistry/metabolism', 'Osteoclasts/pathology', 'Osteolysis/*complications/*diagnosis/metabolism/pathology', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Receptors, Vitronectin/*metabolism', 'Spine/diagnostic imaging/metabolism', 'Tail', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed', 'Treatment Outcome']",,"['0 (Copper Radioisotopes)', '0 (Diphosphonates)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Receptors, Vitronectin)', '0 (integrin alphavbeta1)', '78VO7F77PN (arginyl-glycyl-aspartic acid)']",,,"['R21 CA098698/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA91842/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA097250-06/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 100730/PHS HHS/United States', 'P01 CA100730-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'F32 CA115148/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA091842/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R24 CA086307/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA097250/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R24 CA86307/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,['NIHMS166780'],,,,,,,,,,

Because hematopoetic stem cells express high levels of the cytosolic enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase-1A1 (ALDH1), we sought to develop an agent that is specific to ALDH1 and thus to cells expressing the enzyme. Such an agent might be also helpful in identifying tumors that are resistant to cyclophosphomide chemotherapy because ALDH1 is known to be responsible for this resistance. METHODS: We developed schemes for the synthesis of two radioiodinated aldehdyes - N-formylmethyl-5-[*I]iodopyridine-3-carboxamide ([*I]FMIC) and 4-diethylamino-3-[*I]iodobenzaldehyde ([*I]DEIBA)-at no-carrier-added levels from their respective tin precursors. These agents were evaluated using pure ALDH1 and tumor cells that expressed the enzyme. RESULTS: The average radiochemical yields for the synthesis of [(125)I]FMIC and [(125)I]DEIBA were 70+/-5% and 47+/-14%, respectively. ALDH1 converted both compounds to respective acids suggesting their suitability as ALDH1 imaging agents. Although ability of ALDH1 within the cells to oxidize one of these substrates was shown, specific uptake in ALDH-expressing tumor cells could not be demonstrated. CONCLUSION: To pursue this approach for ALDH1 imaging, radiolabeled aldehydes need to be designed such that, in addition to being good substrates for ALDH1, the cognate products should be sufficiently polar so as to be retained within the cells.","['Vaidyanathan, Ganesan', 'Song, Haijing', 'Affleck, Donna', 'McDougald, Darryl L', 'Storms, Robert W', 'Zalutsky, Michael R', 'Chin, Bennett B']","['Vaidyanathan G', 'Song H', 'Affleck D', 'McDougald DL', 'Storms RW', 'Zalutsky MR', 'Chin BB']","['Department of Radiology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC 27710, USA. ganesan.v@duke.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20091003,United States,Nucl Med Biol,Nuclear medicine and biology,9304420,PMC2771120,2009/10/31 06:00,2010/02/04 06:00,['2009/10/31 06:00'],"['2008/08/27 00:00 [received]', '2009/07/10 00:00 [revised]', '2009/08/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/10/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/04 06:00 [medline]']","['S0969-8051(09)00211-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.nucmedbio.2009.08.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Nucl Med Biol. 2009 Nov;36(8):919-29. doi: 10.1016/j.nucmedbio.2009.08.001.

Human monoblastic leukemia cells (U937) were exposed to As-grown MWCNTs and MWCNTs that were thermally treated at 1800 degrees C (HTT1800) and 2800 degrees C (HTT2800). Cell proliferation was highly inhibited by As-grown but not HTT2800. However, both As-grown and HTT1800, which include some impurities, were cytotoxic. Proteomics analysis of MWCNT-exposed cells revealed 37 protein spots on 2-dimensional electrophoresis gels that significantly changed (p<0.05) after exposure to HTT1800 with a little iron and 20 spots that changed after exposure to HTT2800. Peptide mass fingerprinting identified 45 proteins that included heat shock protein beta-1, neutral alpha-glucosidase AB, and DNA mismatch repair protein Msh2. These altered proteins play roles in metabolism, biosynthesis, response to stress, and cell differentiation. Although HTT2800 did not inhibit cell proliferation or cause cytotoxicity in vitro, some proteins related to the response to stress were changed. Moreover, DJ-1 protein, which is a biomarker of Parkinson's disease and is related to cancer, was identified after exposure to both MWCNTs. These results show that the cytotoxicity of MWCNTs depends on their impurities, such as iron, while MWCNTs themselves cause some biological responses directly and/or indirectly in vitro. Our proteomics-based approach for detecting biological responses to nanomaterials is a promising new method for detailed safety evaluations.","['Haniu, Hisao', 'Matsuda, Yoshikazu', 'Takeuchi, Kenji', 'Kim, Yoong Ahm', 'Hayashi, Takuya', 'Endo, Morinobu']","['Haniu H', 'Matsuda Y', 'Takeuchi K', 'Kim YA', 'Hayashi T', 'Endo M']","['Institute of Carbon Science and Technology, School of Medicine, Shinshu University, 3-1-1 Asahi, Matsumoto, Nagano 390-8621, Japan. hhaniu@shinshu-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091027,United States,Toxicol Appl Pharmacol,Toxicology and applied pharmacology,0416575,,2009/10/31 06:00,2010/02/19 06:00,['2009/10/31 06:00'],"['2009/07/31 00:00 [received]', '2009/10/18 00:00 [revised]', '2009/10/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/10/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/19 06:00 [medline]']","['S0041-008X(09)00453-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.taap.2009.10.015 [doi]']",ppublish,Toxicol Appl Pharmacol. 2010 Feb 1;242(3):256-62. doi: 10.1016/j.taap.2009.10.015.

Beside several well-described genetic lesions, a growing amount of data suggests that abnormalities in DNA methylation profile contribute to multistep secondary leukemogenesis. Two distinct alterations of normal DNA methylation patterns may occur in cancer: a global hypomethylation resulting in chromosomal instability and loss of genetic integrity, and promoter specific DNA hypermethylation which leads to silencing of tumor suppressor genes. Cytotoxic drugs and radiation have been shown to affect tissue DNA methylation profile. Radiation is able to induce a stable DNA hypomethylation in both target and bystander tissues. Gene promoter methylation is a common finding in t-MDS/AML and has been associated to a shorter latency period from the treatment of the primary tumor. Among the studied genes, p15 methylation correlated to monosomy/deletion of chromosome 7q, suggesting that it could be a relevant event in alkylating agent-induced leukemogenesis. We found frequent methylation of DAPK in the t-MDS/AML group, especially in patients with a previous lymphoproliferative disease. In patients studied for concurrent methylation of several promoters, t-MDS/AML were significantly more frequently hypermethylated in 2 or more promoter regions than de novo MDS or AML suggesting that promoter hypermethylation of genes involved in cell cycle control, apoptosis and DNA repair pathways is a frequent finding in t-MDS/AML and may contribute to secondary leukemogenesis. However, how the epigenetic machinery is disrupted after chemo/radiotherapy and during secondary carcinogenesis is still unknown, warranting further studies.","['Voso, Maria Teresa', ""D'Alo, Francesco"", 'Greco, Mariangela', 'Fabiani, Emiliano', 'Criscuolo, Marianna', 'Migliara, Giuseppe', 'Pagano, Livio', 'Fianchi, Luana', 'Guidi, Francesco', 'Hohaus, Stefan', 'Leone, Giuseppe']","['Voso MT', ""D'Alo F"", 'Greco M', 'Fabiani E', 'Criscuolo M', 'Migliara G', 'Pagano L', 'Fianchi L', 'Guidi F', 'Hohaus S', 'Leone G']","['Istituto di Ematologia, Universita Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Largo A Gemelli 8, 00168Rome, Italy. mtvoso@rm.unicatt.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091027,Ireland,Chem Biol Interact,Chemico-biological interactions,0227276,,2009/10/31 06:00,2010/04/24 06:00,['2009/10/31 06:00'],"['2009/09/03 00:00 [received]', '2009/10/15 00:00 [revised]', '2009/10/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/10/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/24 06:00 [medline]']","['S0009-2797(09)00463-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cbi.2009.10.013 [doi]']",ppublish,Chem Biol Interact. 2010 Mar 19;184(1-2):46-9. doi: 10.1016/j.cbi.2009.10.013.

To define mediators of MK-0457 responsiveness, kinase inhibitory profiles were examined in multiple cell models of imatinib sensitive and resistant disease. Aurora and BCR-ABL kinase inhibition were consistently measured at 20-100 nM and 2-10 microM MK-0457, respectively, but expression of T315I-BCR-ABL and overexpression of Lyn kinase reduced MK-0457 sensitivity. Aurora kinase inhibition was associated with cell cycle restriction and p53 induction and p53-null cells were far less responsive to MK-0457, requiring BCR-ABL inhibitory concentrations for apoptotic activity. In wild-type p53 expressing CML cells MK-0457 sensitivity was modulation by alterations in p53 levels through HDM-2 inhibition and gene silencing. MK-0457 suppressed aurora kinase activity and induced apoptosis in imatinib resistant clinical specimens expressing T315I and other BCR-ABL mutations without effecting BCR-ABL kinase activity. Together, these results suggest that MK-0457 apoptotic activity in CML cells is primarily associated with aurora kinase inhibition but can be altered by multiple molecular changes associated with disease progression or acquisition of imatinib resistance.","['Donato, Nicholas J', 'Fang, Dexing', 'Sun, Hanshi', 'Giannola, Diane', 'Peterson, Luke F', 'Talpaz, Moshe']","['Donato NJ', 'Fang D', 'Sun H', 'Giannola D', 'Peterson LF', 'Talpaz M']","['University of Michigan, Department of Internal Medicine, 1500 E.

Feature selection is often used to address this problem by selecting informative genes from among thousands or tens of thousands of genes. However, most of the existing methods of microarray-based cancer classification utilize too many genes to achieve accurate classification, which often hampers the interpretability of the models. For a better understanding of the classification results, it is desirable to develop simpler rule-based models with as few marker genes as possible. METHODS: We screened a small number of informative single genes and gene pairs on the basis of their depended degrees proposed in rough sets. Applying the decision rules induced by the selected genes or gene pairs, we constructed cancer classifiers. We tested the efficacy of the classifiers by leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) of training sets and classification of independent test sets. RESULTS: We applied our methods to five cancerous gene expression datasets: leukemia (acute lymphoblastic leukemia [ALL] vs. acute myeloid leukemia [AML]), lung cancer, prostate cancer, breast cancer, and leukemia (ALL vs. mixed-lineage leukemia [MLL] vs. AML). Accurate classification outcomes were obtained by utilizing just one or two genes. Some genes that correlated closely with the pathogenesis of relevant cancers were identified. In terms of both classification performance and algorithm simplicity, our approach outperformed or at least matched existing methods. CONCLUSION: In cancerous gene expression datasets, a small number of genes, even one or two if selected correctly, is capable of achieving an ideal cancer classification effect. This finding also means that very simple rules may perform well for cancerous class prediction.","['Wang, Xiaosheng', 'Gotoh, Osamu']","['Wang X', 'Gotoh O']","['Department of Intelligence Science and Technology, Graduate School of Informatics, Kyoto University, Kyoto 606-8501, Japan. david@genome.ist.i.kyoto-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091030,England,BMC Med Genomics,BMC medical genomics,101319628,PMC2777919,2009/10/31 06:00,2010/01/16 06:00,['2009/10/31 06:00'],"['2009/02/05 00:00 [received]', '2009/10/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/10/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/16 06:00 [medline]']","['1755-8794-2-64 [pii]', '10.1186/1755-8794-2-64 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Med Genomics. 2009 Oct 30;2:64. doi: 10.1186/1755-8794-2-64.,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Breast Neoplasms/genetics', 'Databases, Genetic', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics', 'Lung Neoplasms/genetics', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/classification/*genetics', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/*methods/statistics & numerical data', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/genetics', 'Reproducibility of Results']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: This study describes three patients with underlying diagnoses of acute myeloid leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and myelodysplasia, respectively, who underwent allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) with unrelated donors matched at the HLA-A, B, C, Dr, and DQ loci but who failed to achieve an adequate PLT count. Investigation using PLT immunofluorescence test, monoclonal antibody immobilization of PLT antigens assay, and genotyping revealed the presence of recipient-derived HPA-1a antibodies. RESULTS: In two patients, anti-HPA-1a was detected post-BMT and in the third patient, anti-HPA-1a was detected during pre-BMT chemotherapy. Despite apparent 100% engraftment of donor cells, the patients' PLT counts failed to recover 9-10 months posttransplant. The patients remained PLT-transfusion dependent and failed to achieve satisfactory increments following random donor or HLA-matched PLT transfusions. After the identification of HPA-1a antibodies, the patients were supported by HPA-1a(-) PLTs and satisfactory posttransfusion PLT increments were obtained. These cases illustrate that HPA-1a antibodies may remain detectable for 10 months following apparently successful donor engraftment and the disappearance of recipient-derived HLA antibodies. The prolonged persistence of recipient-derived PLT-specific antibodies following BMT has to our knowledge not been described previously. CONCLUSION: HPA-1a antibodies were associated with protracted PLT-transfusion dependence and significant hemorrhagic complications. Appropriate and timely laboratory investigation for HPA-specific antibodies followed by transfusion support with HPA-selected PLTs provided the cornerstone of the hemostatic management in these cases.","['Lucas, Geoff', 'Culliford, Steven', 'Green, Frances', 'Sidra, Gamal', 'Calvert, Anthony', 'Green, Ann', 'Harrison, Penny', 'Harvey, John', 'Allen, Dave', 'Smillie, David', 'Masurekar, Ashish', 'Marks, David', 'Russell, Nigel', 'Massey, Edwin']","['Lucas G', 'Culliford S', 'Green F', 'Sidra G', 'Calvert A', 'Green A', 'Harrison P', 'Harvey J', 'Allen D', 'Smillie D', 'Masurekar A', 'Marks D', 'Russell N', 'Massey E']","['Histocompatibility& Immunogenetics, NHS Blood and Transplant, Northway, Bristol, UK. geoff.lucas@nbs.nhs.uk']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20091023,United States,Transfusion,Transfusion,0417360,,2009/10/31 06:00,2010/03/31 06:00,['2009/10/31 06:00'],"['2009/10/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/31 06:00 [medline]']","['TRF2448 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1537-2995.2009.02448.x [doi]']",ppublish,Transfusion. 2010 Feb;50(2):334-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1537-2995.2009.02448.x.

Deregulation of this pathway has been found in animal models suggesting that it acts as tumour suppressor in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Although DNA methylation is the main mechanism of regulation of the canonical Wnt pathway in AML, the role of WNT5A abnormalities has never been evaluated in this clinical setting. The methylation status of WNT5A promoter-exon 1 was analyzed by methylation-specific PCR and sequencing in eleven AML-derived cell lines and 252 AML patients. We observed WNT5A hypermethylation in seven cell lines and in 43% (107/252) of AML patients. WNT5A methylation was associated with decreased WNT5A expression (P < 0.001) that was restored after exposure to 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine. Moreover, WNT5A hypermethylation correlated with upregulation of CYCLIN D1 expression (P < 0.001). Relapse (15%vs 37%, P < 0.001) and mortality (61%vs 79%, P = 0.004) rates were lower for patients in the non-methylated group. Disease-free survival and overall survival at 6 and 7 years, respectively, were 60% and 27% for unmethylated patients and 20% and 0% for hypermethylated patients (P = 0.0001 and P = 0.04, respectively). Interestingly, significant differences were also observed when the analysis was carried out according to cytogenetic risk groups. We demonstrate that WNT5A, a putative tumor suppressor gene in AML, is silenced by methylation in this disease and that this epigenetic event is associated with upregulation of CYCLIN D1 expression and confers poor prognosis in patients with AML.","['Martin, Vanesa', 'Valencia, Ana', 'Agirre, Xabier', 'Cervera, Jose', 'San Jose-Eneriz, Edurne', 'Vilas-Zornoza, Amaia', 'Rodriguez-Otero, Paula', 'Sanz, Miguel A', 'Herrera, Concepcion', 'Torres, Antonio', 'Prosper, Felipe', 'Roman-Gomez, Jose']","['Martin V', 'Valencia A', 'Agirre X', 'Cervera J', 'San Jose-Eneriz E', 'Vilas-Zornoza A', 'Rodriguez-Otero P', 'Sanz MA', 'Herrera C', 'Torres A', 'Prosper F', 'Roman-Gomez J']","['Hematology Department, Cellular Therapy Area, Reina Sofia Hospital, Maimonides Institute for Biomedical Research, Cordoba, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091029,England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,,2009/10/31 06:00,2010/03/17 06:00,['2009/10/31 06:00'],"['2009/10/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/17 06:00 [medline]']","['CAS1413 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1349-7006.2009.01413.x [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2010 Feb;101(2):425-32. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.2009.01413.x.

The post-transplant MRD detected by LNA-AS-qPCR analysis was well correlated with chimerism assessed by short tandem repeat PCR analysis. Non-intensive chemotherapy exerted no substantial reduction of the tumour burden in three patients.

Suspensions rapidly frozen to -196 degrees C. were in all cases innocuous, whereas those frozen slowly were capable of transmitting leukemia. The infectivity of slowly frozen material varied from an estimated 0.0001 per cent to 1 per cent of that of fresh material, and this figure probably represents the percentage of surviving leukemic cells. Particles of spleen and lymph node reacted to slow and rapid freezing in the same manner as suspensions prepared from them. For one of the strains rapid thawing was less injurious than slow thawing; for the other two the rate of thawing seemed to be immaterial. Infectivity was equally well preserved after freezing to -21 degrees C. whether freezing occurred spontaneously after supercooling or was initiated near the freezing point by inoculation with ice, or whether thawing was slow or rapid. Suspensions already slowly frozen at temperatures of -2 degrees or lower, whether spontaneously or by inoculation with ice, could no longer be completely inactivated by subsequent rapid cooling to -196 degrees C. Unfrozen suspensions initially above the freezing point or supercooled to -2 degrees C. or -8 degrees C. and then rapidly cooled to -196 degrees C. were inactivated. This protective action of previous slow freezing was most marked when the initial temperature of the frozen suspension was -15 degrees C. or lower; when it was -2 degrees C. protection was barely detected. These observations indicate that the changes which are peculiar to rapid freezing alone and lead to complete inactivation take place during rapid transition from the liquid to the solid state, in a range of temperature lying between -15 degrees C. and the freezing point. Temperature measurements carried out in this range showed that suspensions were about equally infections whether the temperature at their centers dropped from 0 degrees C. to -15 degrees C. in 30 minutes or in 1 minute; when the drop occurred in 12 seconds or less, the suspensions became innocuous.","['Breedis, C']",['Breedis C'],"['Department of Pathology, Cornell University Medical College, New York.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,PMC2135309,1942/09/01 00:00,1942/09/01 00:01,['2009/10/30 06:00'],"['2009/10/30 06:00 [entrez]', '1942/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1942/09/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.1084/jem.76.3.221 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 1942 Sep 1;76(3):221-40. doi: 10.1084/jem.76.3.221.,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This method is vastly superior to others previously used. Normal human pregnancy without significant anemia may show active radio iron absorption-16 to 27 per cent of iron intake. The pregnant woman as a rule shows 2 to 10 times the normal absorption of radio iron. Diseased states in which iron stores are known to be very abundant-pernicious anemia, hemochromatosis, familial icterus, and Mediterranean anemia -show very little absorption, probably less than normal. This is in spite of a severe anemia in all conditions except hemochromatosis. Chronic infections in spite of anemia show no utilization of radio iron, whether it may be absorbed or not. Leukemia shows little utilization of radio iron in red cells in spite of absorption (autopsy), probably because of white cells choking the red marrow. Polycythemia shows very low values for iron absorption as do normal persons. Two pregnant women showed only normal iron absorption. We believe that reserve stores of iron in the body, rather than anemia, control iron absorption. This control is exerted upon the gastro-intestinal mucosa which can refuse or accept iron under various conditions.","['Balfour, W M', 'Hahn, P F', 'Bale, W F', 'Pommerenke, W T', 'Whipple, G H']","['Balfour WM', 'Hahn PF', 'Bale WF', 'Pommerenke WT', 'Whipple GH']","['Departments of Pathology, Radiology, Obstetrics and Gynecology of the University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry, Rochester, New York.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,PMC2135296,1942/07/01 00:00,1942/07/01 00:01,['2009/10/30 06:00'],"['2009/10/30 06:00 [entrez]', '1942/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1942/07/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.1084/jem.76.1.15 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 1942 Jul 1;76(1):15-30. doi: 10.1084/jem.76.1.15.,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two highly inbred strains of mice of different genetic constitution (Storrs-Little and C58) were used in a study of the influence of hosts on metabolism of cells of transmissible lymphatic leukemia. The experiments were carried out with leukemic cells of transmission Line I as well as with Line M-liver. About 50 per cent of the Storrs-Little mice were killed by each line of cells at this time, while 100 per cent of the C58 mice were killed. 2. The normal lymphoid tissues of the two strains of mice were significantly the same in regard to rates of oxygen consumption and both aerobic and anaerobic glycolysis. 3. Leukemic cells of Line I, growing in hosts of Strain Storrs-Little, gave significantly lower rates of aerobic and anaerobic glycolysis than when growing in hosts of Strain C58. Oxygen consumption was significantly higher. Leukemic cells of Line M-liver, growing in hosts of Strain Storrs-Little, gave significantly lower rates of aerobic and anaerobic glycolysis than when growing in Strain C58. Oxygen consumption was not significantly different. 4. After one to three passages through hosts of Strain Storrs-Little, the cell lines were returned to hosts of Strain C58, with immediate return to significantly the same metabolic rates originally given by each line in hosts of Strain C58. 5. These results lead to the more general conclusions that: (a) The genetic constitution of the host modifies the metabolism of the cell line. (b) The same host constitution may modify the metabolism of different cell lines in different ways. (c) Host constitution does not appear to modify the inherent constitution of the leukemic cells, but acts as a determining environmental factor on their metabolism.","['Victor, J', 'Potter, J S']","['Victor J', 'Potter JS']","['Department of Pathology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, and the Department of Genetics, Carnegie Institution of Washington, Cold Spring Harbor.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,PMC2132436,1934/10/31 00:00,1934/10/31 00:01,['2009/10/30 06:00'],"['2009/10/30 06:00 [entrez]', '1934/10/31 00:00 [pubmed]', '1934/10/31 00:01 [medline]']",['10.1084/jem.60.5.547 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 1934 Oct 31;60(5):547-58. doi: 10.1084/jem.60.5.547.,5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Pernicious anemia shows very high values and the liver in untreated cases may show maximal storage of the hemoglobin producing factors. Liver therapy reduces this store as the missing factor is supplied and new hemoglobin and red cells can be turned out by the marrow. Aplastic anemia likewise shows high concentration of hemoglobin producing factors as there is no outlet for this material through the red marrow. Secondary anemia due to loss of blood will show low normal values but even long standing severe anemia will not seriously deplete this store of hemoglobin producing factors in the liver. Secondary anemia due to blood destruction within the body shows higher values and some excess store of hemoglobin producing factors and iron. Leukemia gives a biological assay like secondary anemia due to blood loss and always presents definite anemia. Iron analyses show conspicuous differences and iron concentration within the liver parenchyma does not in any way parallel the concentration of hemoglobin producing factors. The highest values for iron concentration are found in aplastic anemia (70 mg. per cent)- high values in pernicious anemia (51 mg. per cent)-normal values in leukemia (13 mg. per cent)-and low values in anemia due to loss of blood (5.3 mg. per cent).

A COMPARISON OF FOUR LINES OF LEUKEMIA TRANSMITTED BY INOCULATION.,823-33,,"Several lines of lymphatic leukemia in mice, experimentally transmitted by inoculation into hosts of a closely inbred strain, have been established and carried on simultaneously. Among the inoculated mice there were found different types of response, according to the line of leukemia inoculated. The differences consisted mainly in the extent or distribution of lesions. Although the same line did not always show the same distribution of lesions, there was a distinct tendency for the cases in a line to present the same characteristics on successive transfers over a considerable period. A comparison of the frequency of the occurrence of certain lesions in four lines of transmission shows that: 1. Increases in the total leucocyte counts were less common and less marked in Lines A and E than in Lines H and I. In the lines first mentioned, normal counts were relatively frequent. In Line H normal counts were uncommon, and in Line I were not observed. The highest counts were found in Line I. 2. Peritoneal effusion was characteristic of Line A for 43 transfers. It was found in Line E, but for a considerably shorter period and in a smaller proportion of cases; it was rare in Lines H and I. 3. Pleural effusion was frequently found in Lines A and E but rarely in Lines H and I. 4. Infiltration in the liver occurred to a marked degree in all the mice of Lines H and I, but in fewer mice and to a variable degree in Lines A and E. 5. Infiltration in the kidney in Line I was present in 90 per cent of the mice, and was of marked grade. In line H it was present in 67 per cent of the mice (24 per cent of marked grade) but in Lines A and E it was rare. 6. A considerable amount of variability in results occurred in Lines A and E, whereas Lines H and I remained remarkably constant. The lesions characteristic of a line were not necessarily those present in the spontaneous case from which the first transfer of the line was made. As the mice used for inoculation were genetically uniform, the differences between the lines are not due to genetic differences in the hosts, but to differences in the materials inoculated.","['Richter, M N', 'Macdowell, E C']","['Richter MN', 'Macdowell EC']","['Department of Pathology of the College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, and the Department of Genetics, Carnegie Institution of Washington, Cold Spring Harbor.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,PMC2131920,1930/11/30 00:00,1930/11/30 00:01,['2009/10/30 06:00'],"['2009/10/30 06:00 [entrez]', '1930/11/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1930/11/30 00:01 [medline]']",['10.1084/jem.52.6.823 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 1930 Nov 30;52(6):823-33. doi: 10.1084/jem.52.6.823.,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

THE EXPERIMENTAL TRANSMISSION OF LEUKEMIA.,659-73,,"Lymphatic leukemia has occurred with great frequency in a particular strain of mice which have been inbred by brother-sister matings since 1921. In addition to typical cases of leukemia are others which, because of the absence of leukemic changes in the blood, correspond to ""pseudoleukemia"" and others which, by the presence of unusually great enlargement of certain lymph node groups resemble the ""leukosarcomatoses"" as observed in man. Examinations of the blood of leukemic mice have shown that leukemic blood pictures are not necessarily early in their appearance, nor are they constant. The blood picture may not, therefore, be used as a criterion for the separation of the two diseases (leukemia and pseudoleukemia) but merely indicates different phases of the same condition. Likewise, cases with lesions intermediate between the local growths of ""leukosarcomatosis"" and the more general lymphatic enlargements of leukemia suggest that these conditions differ only in the distribution of lesions but not in their nature. Lymphatic leukemia occurring spontaneously in this strain may be transmitted to other mice of the same strain, and carried, apparently, for an unlimited number of transfers in animals at an earlier age than that at which leukemia occurs spontaneously. In each of 10 such experiments transmissions were obtained. The lesions produced by inoculation correspond to those of spontaneous cases, in that they consist of growths of abnormal lymphoid cells which infiltrate tissues and organs and often appear in the circulating blood. Only minor differences have occurred, some of which are characteristic of certain experimental lines. After repeated transfers, the disease tends to run a more acute course. Among the cases in which transmissions occurred, are some without leukemic changes in the blood, and many with local growths at the site of inoculation or in certain node groups. The differences in the blood pictures and distribution of lesions (which latter may be influenced to some extent by the method of inoculation) correspond to similar differences which are sometimes observed in the spontaneous cases.","['Richter, M N', 'Macdowell, E C']","['Richter MN', 'Macdowell EC']","['Department of Pathology of the College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, and the Department of Genetics, Carnegie Institution of Washington, Cold Spring Harbor.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,PMC2131846,1930/03/31 00:00,1930/03/31 00:01,['2009/10/30 06:00'],"['2009/10/30 06:00 [entrez]', '1930/03/31 00:00 [pubmed]', '1930/03/31 00:01 [medline]']",['10.1084/jem.51.4.659 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 1930 Mar 31;51(4):659-73. doi: 10.1084/jem.51.4.659.,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Studies of autoimmune-like activity in completely syngeneic and semisyngeneic systems.,230-7,,"A possible consequence of an antilymphocytic autoimmune process would be serious impairment of an animal's ability to destroy tumor cells. One measure of autoimmune reactivity of this type would be the demonstration of cellular immune responsiveness by cells from tumor-bearing mice against syngeneic normal cells. These experiments demonstrate that spleen cells from mice bearing a lymphocytic leukemia of identical histocompatability type as the host mounted a vigorous immune response against normal syngeneic cells in a mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR). Moreover, ascitic cells from leukemic mice responded significantly to normal syngeneic spleen cells in MLR's. The former reactions are usually much more vigorous than the responses of normal to malignant cells. These results are discussed in terms of the relationship between autoimmunity and neoplasia.

Studies of vigorous immune responsiveness induced in f(1) mice by parental strain tumor cells.,224-9,,"The establishment of an intimate connection between autoimmunity and neoplasia would require the demonstration of an experimentally induced, tumor-dependent autoimmune process. For this reason, we have studied cellular immune reactions of mice bearing a transplantable leukemia (L1210). Spleen cells from hybrid BDF(1) mice bearing the L1210 tumor (BDFt) reacted vigorously in mixed lymphocyte culture with mitomycin-treated, normal spleen cells from mice of the parental strain from which the L1210 tumor was derived (DBA/2). Spleen cells from nontumor-bearing BDF(1) mice reacted only weakly with these parental cells. The BDFt cells likewise did not respond when cultured with mitomycin-treated spleen cells from the other parental strain (C57B1/6). The vigorous mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) by BDFt cells against normal parental cells of the same strain as the tumor was not due to a double exposure of the reacting cells to histocompatibility antigens shared by tumor cells and normal parental cells. The response of cells from tumor-bearing F(1) mice against normal parental cells seen in these experiments suggests the possibility of the induction of an autoimmune-like process against host lymphocytes by spleen cells from leukemic mice. Theoretically such a phenomenon would considerably reduce an animal's ability to mount an immune attack against malignant cells.","['Devlin, R G', 'McCurdy, J D', 'Baronowsky, P E']","['Devlin RG', 'McCurdy JD', 'Baronowsky PE']","['Biochemistry Department, Mead Johnson Research Center, Evansville, Indiana 47721.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,PMC2139503,1974/01/01 00:00,1974/01/01 00:01,['2009/10/30 06:00'],"['2009/10/30 06:00 [entrez]', '1974/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1974/01/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.1084/jem.139.1.224 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 1974 Jan 1;139(1):224-9. doi: 10.1084/jem.139.1.224.,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Antibodies binding rI.rC-(14)C in human lupus sera, in NZB/NZW F(1) (B/W) mice developing lupus, and in NZB, ALN, and ALN/NZB mice have greatest specificity for reovirus double-stranded RNA.

Induction of tolerance in this way prevents the accelerated formation of anti-RNA antibodies normally induced by MLV.

One may picture the process either as a partial or as a complete breaking down of certain proteid. material more or less rich in hexon bases, leaving behind. proteid matter poorer in bases. The meaning of these changes is, however, obscure, and with the limited number of known facts bearing upon the subject, it would seem idle even to attempt to formulate an hypothesis to explain them. Certain work of other investigators is, however, suggestive in this connection. Kossel and Dakin, for instance, as illustrated by their work upon the simple proteid body clupein, found that a partial destruction of the proteid molecule, involving the arginin group, is brought about by a ferment furnished by the animal organism. When subjected to the hydrolytic action of a mineral acid, clupein yields arginin in considerable abundance. But if the clupein is first acted upon by the ferment arginase found in the liver, and then subjected to acid hydrolysis, the yield of arginin is appreciably diminished. Among the cleavage products in the latter instance are the components of arginin, namely, omithin and urea. It would seem, therefore, as if the ferment had loosened the union between the omithin and urea in the arginin group, so that upon subsequent hydrolysis a diminution of arginin resulted. In the cases studied by me, it may be that the conditions were favorable for some such ferment action as that above described, and hence the relatively low yield of arginin. No attempt, however, was made to ascertain if omithin were present in the urine. Its presence there would seem not wholly unlikely when one considers the diminished power of oxidation of the phosphorus-poisoned cell, although Thompson has shown that arginin or omithin when administered to a healthy dog as food or by hypodermic injection is eliminated for the most part as urea, no ornithin being found. There might seem to be a conflict between this view and the results recently published by Wohlgemuth, but it must be borne in mind that the influences at work causing the breaking down of the proteid molecule are probably quite diverse in character. Wohlgemuth has recently shown for the first time that a diamino acid may actually find its way into the urine in phosphorus poisoning. He found arginin in the urine not only in rabbits poisoned with phosphorus but also in a patient suffering from phosphorus poisoning. On the other hand, he was unable to find lysin in the urine. This fact is of especial interest in view of the evidence set forth in this paper that the arginin base is lost to the proteid molecule more rapidly than the lysin base. The correspondence between the findings in the liver and in the urine is thus a close one. How much of the arginin liberated from the proteid molecule may find its way into the urine is of course uncertain. It seems reasonable to suppose that a portion of the base is acted upon by the arginase ferment in the manner already described. Of the seventeen to eighteen cleavage products of the proteid molecule thus far isolated, the hexon bases are among the most stable. One or more of these bases have been found in practically all proteid matter thus far investigated; in fact arginin is so uniformly present that Kossel has made the suggestion that it is the kernel of the proteid molecule. At all events, the question may be asked, whether, if the influences at work in the altered liver tissue were of a general character causing a diminution of the hexon bases, the monoamino acid groups would not suffer even a greater diminution; and since the pathological condition is undoubtedly associated with impaired oxidation, their presence should not be expected in the urine. As a matter of fact, Ignatowski found considerable quantities of monoamino acids in the urine of patients suffering from gout, pneumonia, and leukaemia, though under normal conditions no monoamino acids were found in the urine, indeed, not even after the subcutaneous injection of glycokoll. Furthermore, the loosening of the amino acids from the proteid molecule is suggested by the fact that Taylor found such acids in the liver of a patient who died from a hepatic disease of obscure etiology, but which he was inclined to attribute to chloroform poisoning. Taylor found not only leucin and tyrosin in the liver, but also arginin, a fact not without interest in view of the diminished arginin content found in the livers of the chloroformed dogs after acid hydrolysis. Moreover, the falling off of the hexon bases under the conditions studied seems quite in accordance with some results recently reported by Levene. He has shown that certain cleavage products obtained by the action of mineral acids upon self-digested pancreas, spleen, and liver, are much diminished when compared with the products obtained from the fresh glands. The lysin and arginin of the digested liver, for example, showed a diminution of over 50 per cent. It is now well established that in course of the process of aseptic autolysis, the proteids of the liver cell undergo decomposition into simpler substances, and Jacoby showed that during life autolysis may go on in portions of the liver in which the circulation has been hindered. But of greater significance still in this connection, is the observation made by Jacoby on the autolytic changes in the liver during phosphorus poisoning. He found that when the normal liver substance is permitted to autolyse the solution of the liver substance is a slow one. On the other hand, under similar conditions the liver of a phosphorus-poisoned animal undergoes rapid and almost complete solution. The difference in the behavior of the normal and damaged liver points to an increase of normal ferment action in the case of the poisoned organ. It thus seems reasonable to suppose that in phosphorus poisoning we have during life an exaggerated breaking down of the proteid molecule associated with an over-action of certain ferments, and among them probably arginase. The pathological process in the liver during life may, therefore, be thought of as proceeding in the same general direction as the process of post-morten autolytic decomposition. By means of further studies along lines indicated in this paper, it should be possible to gain a deeper insight into numerous pathological processes. The changes in amyloid degeneration are among those which promise to be better understood through the application of the new methods of chemical analysis. Moreover, it cannot be doubted that pharmacology as well as toxicology has much to gain from a study of what happens to the proteid molecule under the influence of poisons.","['Wakeman, A J']",['Wakeman AJ'],"['Laboratory of the Physiologisches Institut, Heidelberg, and the Laboratory of Professor C.

Although vitamin D derivatives (deltanoids) can induce differentiation of AML cells in vitro, so far deltanoids have not been successfully brought to the clinic, due to the likelihood of life-threatening hypercalcemia. Here, we incubated freshly obtained blood cells from patients with AML with a plant antioxidant (PAOx), silibinin (SIL), alone or together with a deltanoid. Twenty patients with AML (all subtypes except M3) were available for this study, and in 14 (70%), SIL (60 microM) either induced differentiation ex vivo, or enhanced differentiation induced by deltanoids, or both. Interestingly, SIL acting alone induced differentiation only in cases in which chromosome aberrations could not be detected. In eleven samples sufficient material was available for a limited analysis of the underlying events. Quantitative RT-PCR showed that differentiation markers were upregulated at the mRNA level by both SIL and deltanoids, suggesting that intracellular signaling pathways upstream of transcription factors (TFs) were activated by these agents. Western analysis for proteins which function as TFs in deltanoid-induced monocytic differentiation, such as members of Jun and C/EBP families, surprisingly demonstrated that SIL upregulated all these TFs in the cases tested. This suggests that although the presence of SIL may not always be sufficient to induce differentiation, it can serve as a differentiation enabling factor for blasts obtained from a large proportion of patients with AML. Thus, SIL/deltanoid combinations warrant further consideration as preventive/therapeutic regimens in human leukaemia.","['Zhang, Jing', 'Harrison, Jonathan S', 'Uskokovic, Milan', 'Danilenko, Michael', 'Studzinski, George P']","['Zhang J', 'Harrison JS', 'Uskokovic M', 'Danilenko M', 'Studzinski GP']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, UMDNJ-New Jersey Medical School, Newark, New Jersey 07103, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,England,Hematol Oncol,Hematological oncology,8307268,PMC2889217,2009/10/30 06:00,2010/10/23 06:00,['2009/10/30 06:00'],"['2009/10/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/hon.929 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematol Oncol. 2010 Sep;28(3):124-32. doi: 10.1002/hon.929.,3,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cholecalciferol/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Monocytes/drug effects/pathology', 'Receptors, Calcitriol/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Retinoid X Receptor alpha/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Silybin', 'Silymarin/*pharmacology', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",,"['0 (Receptors, Calcitriol)', '0 (Retinoid X Receptor alpha)', '0 (Silymarin)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '1C6V77QF41 (Cholecalciferol)', '4RKY41TBTF (Silybin)']","['(c) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']",,"['R01-CA 044722/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA117942-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA117942/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA044722-19/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA044722/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA 117942/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,['NIHMS170018'],,,,,,,,,,

RKS262 was identified by structural optimization of Nifurtimox which is currently undergoing phase II clinical trials to treat high-risk neuroblastoma. In a NCI(60) cell-line assay RKS262 exhibited significant cytotoxicity in ovarian cancer cells and a variety of other cell lines exceeding effects of commercial drugs such as cisplatin, 5-FU, cyclophosphamide or sapacitabine. Various leukemia cell-lines were most sensitive (GI(50): ~ 10 nM) while several non-small cell lung cancer cell lines and few cell lines from other tissues were relatively resistant (GI(50) > 1 microM) to RKS262 treatment. The mechanism of cytotoxicity was examined using ovarian cancer cell-line OVCAR-3 as a model. RKS262 treatment resulted in a reduced mitochondria-transmembrane-depolarization potential. RKS262 effects included up-regulation of apoptotic markers and were not correlated with activation of pro-apoptotic MAP-Kinases (p38, SAP/JNK). RKS262 exerted strong inhibitory effects on oncogene ras, down-regulated DNA-pk KU-80 subunit expression and caused activation of Akt. A signature effect of RKS262 is the regulation of the mitochondrial Bcl2-family pathway. Pro-apoptotic factors Bid, Bad and Bok were up-regulated while expression of pro-survival factors Bcl-xl and Mcl-1 was inhibited. Moreover, at sub-cytotoxic doses RKS262 delayed OVCAR-3 cell-cycle progression through G2 phase and up-regulated p27 while cyclin-D1 and Cdk-6 were down-regulated, indicating that RKS262 is a specific cyclin/CDK inhibitor. In summary, RKS262 has been identified as a molecule belonging to a new class of potential chemotherapeutic agents affecting the viability of multiple cancer cell-lines and causing selective adverse effects on the viability of ovarian cancer cells.","['Singh, Rakesh K', 'Lange, Thilo S', 'Kim, Kyu Kwang', 'Brard, Laurent']","['Singh RK', 'Lange TS', 'Kim KK', 'Brard L']","[""Molecular Therapeutics Laboratory, Program in Women's Oncology, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Women and Infants' Hospital of RI, The Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University, 101 Dudley Street, Providence, RI 02905, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20091029,United States,Invest New Drugs,Investigational new drugs,8309330,PMC4801487,2009/10/30 06:00,2011/04/13 06:00,['2009/10/30 06:00'],"['2009/08/18 00:00 [received]', '2009/09/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/10/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/04/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10637-009-9335-4 [doi]'],ppublish,Invest New Drugs. 2011 Feb;29(1):63-72. doi: 10.1007/s10637-009-9335-4.

MicroRNAs are a type of small noncoding RNA molecules that have been shown to control gene expression in eukaryotes. Aberrant expression and alteration of miRNAs may be responsible for human diseases including cancer. An miR16-1 (C > T) + 7 gene mutation has been previously found in familial chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients, one of which reported a family history of breast cancer. miR16-1 regulates the expression of bcl-2, which is important in retinoblastoma, and is located in a genomic region that is frequently lost in nasopharyngeal and hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs). Therefore, miR16-1 may be potentially important in the etiology of several solid tumors. To understand the power of the miR16-1 (C > T) + 7 mutation as a prognostic and diagnostic risk factor, we investigated the mutation in patients with seven different types of cancer including 188 with breast, 102 with ovarian, and 22 nasopharyngeal carcinomas, 96 HCC, 872 chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), 39 chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and 46 retinoblastoma cases from three different ethnic groups and of hereditary and sporadic etiology. Methods. 5'Nuclease TaqMan SNP genotyping assay was used to detect the miR16-1 gene C > T substitution. Results. The miR16-1 (C > T) + 7 substitution was not detected in any of the groups studied. Conclusions. Considering the large scale of our study, the representation of different ethnicities and levels of hereditary risk, we conclude that the miR-16-1 (C > T) + 7 mutation is not a good diagnostic or prognostic indicator of risk for the cancers tested.","['Yazici, Hulya', 'Zipprich, Jennifer', 'Peng, Tao', 'Akisik, Elif Z', 'Tigli, Hulya', 'Isin, Mustafa', 'Akisik, Ebru E', 'Terry, Mary Beth', 'Senie, Ruby T', 'Li, Lequn', 'Peng, Minhao', 'Liu, Zhiming', 'Dalay, Nejat', 'Santella, Regina M']","['Yazici H', 'Zipprich J', 'Peng T', 'Akisik EZ', 'Tigli H', 'Isin M', 'Akisik EE', 'Terry MB', 'Senie RT', 'Li L', 'Peng M', 'Liu Z', 'Dalay N', 'Santella RM']","['Department of Environmental Health Sciences, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, NewYork, NY 10032, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20091026,Egypt,J Oncol,Journal of oncology,101496537,PMC2766826,2009/10/30 06:00,2009/10/30 06:01,['2009/10/30 06:00'],"['2009/03/17 00:00 [received]', '2009/07/08 00:00 [revised]', '2009/09/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/10/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/30 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1155/2009/827532 [doi]'],ppublish,J Oncol. 2009;2009:827532. doi: 10.1155/2009/827532.

Thus, there is great interest in protecting human hematopoietic stem cells by the transfer of drug resistance genes. The main focus of this study was the simultaneous overexpression of multidrug resistance 1 (MDR1) and the O(6)-benzylguanine (O(6)-BG)-resistant mutant MGMT(P140K) (O(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase) with a bicistronic lentiviral vector (HR'SIN-MDR1-IRES-MGMT(P140K)), with regard to the capability to convey chemoprotection in the leukemia cell line, HL60, and human hematopoietic stem cells (CD34(+)). Combination therapy with O(6)-BG/1-(2-chloroethyl)-3-(4-amino-2-methylpyrimidine-5-yl)methyl-1-nitrosourea ) (ACNU) plus paclitaxel showed a significant survival advantage of HL60 cells transduced with this combination vector. In CD34(+) cells, monotherapy with O(6)-BG/temozolomide (TMZ) resulted in an increased percentage of MGMT-positive cells (vs untreated cells) after transduction with HR'SIN-MDR1-IRES-MGMT(P140K) (28.3%). For combination therapy with O(6)-BG/temozolomide plus paclitaxel the increase was higher with the combination vector (52.8%) than with a vector expressing MGMT(P140K) solely (29.1%). With regard to MDR1-positive cells the protective effect of the combination vector (88.5%) was comparable to the single vector HR'SIN-MDR1 (90.0%) for monotherapy with paclitaxel and superior for combination therapy with O(6)-BG/temozolomide plus paclitaxel (84.6 vs 69.7%). In conclusion, the combination vector presents simultaneous protective effects of two drug-resistance genes, offering an opportunity to increase the cancer therapeutic index.","['Maier, P', 'Spier, I', 'Laufs, S', 'Veldwijk, M R', 'Fruehauf, S', 'Wenz, F', 'Zeller, W J']","['Maier P', 'Spier I', 'Laufs S', 'Veldwijk MR', 'Fruehauf S', 'Wenz F', 'Zeller WJ']","['Pharmacology of Cancer Treatment, DKFZ, German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany. patrick.maier@radonk.ma.uni-heidelberg.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091029,England,Gene Ther,Gene therapy,9421525,,2009/10/30 06:00,2010/06/15 06:00,['2009/10/30 06:00'],"['2009/10/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/15 06:00 [medline]']","['gt2009133 [pii]', '10.1038/gt.2009.133 [doi]']",ppublish,Gene Ther. 2010 Mar;17(3):389-99. doi: 10.1038/gt.2009.133.

This review describes the pathogenetic role of multiple cellular signaling pathways in T-cell malignancies and the potential therapeutic strategies based on the modulation of these key signaling networks.","['Zhao, W-L']",['Zhao WL'],"['State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Shanghai Rui Jin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, 197 Rui Jin Er Road, Shanghai 200025, China. weili_zhao_sih@yahoo.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20091029,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,2009/10/30 06:00,2010/01/28 06:00,['2009/10/30 06:00'],"['2009/10/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/28 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2009223 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2009.223 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2010 Jan;24(1):13-21. doi: 10.1038/leu.2009.223.

One of the main diagnostic criteria is the accumulation of heterogeneous monocytes in the peripheral blood. We further explored this cellular heterogeneity and observed that part of the leukemic clone in the peripheral blood was made of immature dysplastic granulocytes with a CD14(-)/CD24(+) phenotype. The proteome profile of these cells is dramatically distinct from that of CD14(+)/CD24(-) monocytes from CMML patients or healthy donors. More specifically, CD14(-)/CD24(+) CMML cells synthesize and secrete large amounts of alpha-defensin 1-3 (HNP1-3). Recombinant HNPs inhibit macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF)-driven differentiation of human peripheral blood monocytes into macrophages. Using transwell, antibody-mediated depletion, suramin inhibition of purinergic receptors, and competitive experiments with uridine diphosphate (UDP)/uridine triphosphate (UTP), we demonstrate that HNP1-3 secreted by CD14(-)/CD24(+) cells inhibit M-CSF-induced differentiation of CD14(+)/CD24(-) cells at least in part through P2Y6, a receptor involved in macrophage differentiation. Altogether, these observations suggest that a population of immature dysplastic granulocytes contributes to the CMML phenotype through production of alpha-defensins HNP1-3 that suppress the differentiation capabilities of monocytes.","['Droin, Nathalie', 'Jacquel, Arnaud', 'Hendra, Jean-Baptiste', 'Racoeur, Cindy', 'Truntzer, Caroline', 'Pecqueur, Delphine', 'Benikhlef, Naima', 'Ciudad, Marion', 'Guery, Leslie', 'Jooste, Valerie', 'Dufour, Erick', 'Fenaux, Pierre', 'Quesnel, Bruno', 'Kosmider, Olivier', 'Fontenay, Michaela', 'Ducoroy, Patrick', 'Solary, Eric']","['Droin N', 'Jacquel A', 'Hendra JB', 'Racoeur C', 'Truntzer C', 'Pecqueur D', 'Benikhlef N', 'Ciudad M', 'Guery L', 'Jooste V', 'Dufour E', 'Fenaux P', 'Quesnel B', 'Kosmider O', 'Fontenay M', 'Ducoroy P', 'Solary E']","['Inserm UMR866, Dijon, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091028,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,2009/10/30 06:00,2010/01/22 06:00,['2009/10/30 06:00'],"['2009/10/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/22 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)30110-5 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2009-05-224352 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 Jan 7;115(1):78-88. doi: 10.1182/blood-2009-05-224352.

Using fluorescence resonance energy transfer, we addressed whether conformational changes in integrin Mac-1 are sufficient to transmit outside-in signals in human neutrophils. Mac-1 conformational activation induced by ligand occupancy or activating Ab binding, but not integrin clustering, triggered similar patterns of intracellular protein tyrosine phosphorylation, including Akt phosphorylation, and inhibited spontaneous neutrophil apoptosis, indicating that global conformational changes are critical for Mac-1-dependent outside-in signal transduction. In neutrophils and myeloid K562 cells, ligand ICAM-1 or activating Ab binding promoted switchblade-like extension of the Mac-1 extracellular domain and separation of the alpha(M) and beta(2) subunit cytoplasmic tails, two structural hallmarks of integrin activation. These data suggest the primacy of global conformational changes in the generation of Mac-1 outside-in signals.","['Lefort, Craig T', 'Hyun, Young-Min', 'Schultz, Joanne B', 'Law, Foon-Yee', 'Waugh, Richard E', 'Knauf, Philip A', 'Kim, Minsoo']","['Lefort CT', 'Hyun YM', 'Schultz JB', 'Law FY', 'Waugh RE', 'Knauf PA', 'Kim M']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, David H.

Using single cell stimulation by IgE-specific Ag and high-speed imaging of conventional or genetically encoded Ca(2+) sensors in rat basophilic leukemia and bone marrow-derived rat mast cells, we observe Ca(2+) waves that originate most frequently from the tips of extended cell protrusions, as well as Ca(2+) oscillations throughout the cell that usually follow the initiating Ca(2+) wave. In contrast, Ag conjugated to the tip of a micropipette stimulates local, repetitive Ca(2+) puffs at the region of cell contact. Initiating Ca(2+) waves are observed in most rat basophilic leukemia cells stimulated with soluble Ag and are sensitive to inhibitors of Ca(2+) release from endoplasmic reticulum stores and to extracellular Ca(2+), but they do not depend on store-operated Ca(2+) entry. Knockdown of transient receptor potential channel (TRPC)1 and TRPC3 channel proteins by short hairpin RNA reduces the sensitivity of these cells to Ag and shifts the wave initiation site from protrusions to the cell body. Our results reveal spatially encoded Ca(2+) signaling in response to immunoreceptor activation that utilizes TRPC channels to specify the initiation site of the Ca(2+) response.","['Cohen, Roy', 'Torres, Alexis', 'Ma, Hong-Tao', 'Holowka, David', 'Baird, Barbara']","['Cohen R', 'Torres A', 'Ma HT', 'Holowka D', 'Baird B']","['Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14850, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20091028,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,PMC3037335,2009/10/30 06:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/10/30 06:00'],"['2009/10/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['jimmunol.0901615 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.0901615 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2009 Nov 15;183(10):6478-88. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.0901615.

These interactions recruit components of the cell's budding machinery that are critical for virus release. MoMLV Gag contains two additional L domains, PSAP and LYPAL, that are believed to drive residual MoMLV release via interactions with cellular proteins Tsg101 and Alix, respectively. We found that overexpression of Tsg101 or Alix failed to rescue the release of PPPY-deficient MoMLV via these other L domains. However, low-level expression of the ubiquitin ligase Itch potently rescued the release and infectivity of MoMLV lacking PPPY function. In contrast, other ubiquitin ligases such as WWP1, Nedd4.1, Nedd4.2, and Nedd4.2s did not rescue this release-deficient virus. Efficient rescue required the ubiquitin ligase activity of Itch and an intact C2 domain but not presence of the endophilin-binding site. Additionally, we found Itch to immunoprecipitate with MoMLV Gag lacking the PPPY motif and to be incorporated into rescued MoMLV particles. The PSAP and LYPAL motifs were dispensable for Itch-mediated virus rescue, and their absence did not affect the incorporation of Itch into the rescued particles. Itch-mediated rescue of release-defective MoMLV was sensitive to inhibition by dominant-negative versions of ESCRT-III components and the VPS4 AAA ATPase, indicating that Itch-mediated correction of MoMLV release defects requires the integrity of the host vacuolar sorting protein pathway. RNA interference knockdown of Itch suppressed the residual release of the MoMLV lacking the PPPY motif. Interestingly, Itch stimulation of the PPPY-deficient MoMLV release was accompanied by the enhancement of Gag ubiquitination and the appearance of new ubiquitinated Gag proteins in virions. Together, these results suggest that Itch can facilitate MoMLV release in an L domain-independent manner via a mechanism that requires the host budding machinery and involves Gag ubiquitination.","['Jadwin, Joshua A', 'Rudd, Victoria', 'Sette, Paola', 'Challa, Swathi', 'Bouamr, Fadila']","['Jadwin JA', 'Rudd V', 'Sette P', 'Challa S', 'Bouamr F']","['Laboratory of Molecular Microbiology, NIAID, NIH, 4 Center Dr., Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",20091028,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,PMC2798346,2009/10/30 06:00,2010/01/13 06:00,['2009/10/30 06:00'],"['2009/10/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/13 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.01319-09 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.01319-09 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2010 Jan;84(2):704-15. doi: 10.1128/JVI.01319-09.

Human T-cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV-1) is linked to the development of adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL), which frequently expresses CD25. CD25 is significantly expressed in childhood ALCL. In Brazil, HTLV-1 infection is endemic, and vertical transmission is responsible for spread to children. Of HTLV-1 carriers, 90% or more remain asymptomatic. Some cases of adult HTLV-1-related lymphomas have characteristics of ALCL but are considered CD30+ ATLL subtypes. No similar cases have been described in children. We analyzed 33 cases of pediatric ALCL, CD25+ and CD25-, for proviral HTLV-1 DNA. All cases corresponded to the common histologic ALCL type and were CD30+ in virtually all neoplastic cells.

ALCL in children has no relationship with HTLV-1; the frequent CD25 expression must be explained by a mechanism different from that in ATLL.","['Gualco, Gabriela', 'Chioato, Lucimara', 'Weiss, Lawrence M', 'Harrington, William J Jr', 'Bacchi, Carlos E']","['Gualco G', 'Chioato L', 'Weiss LM', 'Harrington WJ Jr', 'Bacchi CE']","['Consultoria em Patologia, Rua Major Leonidas Cardoso 739, Botucatu, SP, Brazil.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,England,Am J Clin Pathol,American journal of clinical pathology,0370470,PMC2771325,2009/10/30 06:00,2009/11/13 06:00,['2009/10/30 06:00'],"['2009/10/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/11/13 06:00 [medline]']","['132/1/28 [pii]', '10.1309/AJCP6Q7QMUVGMVMF [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Clin Pathol. 2009 Jul;132(1):28-33. doi: 10.1309/AJCP6Q7QMUVGMVMF.,1,IM,"['Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase', 'Cell Nucleus/enzymology/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 2', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 5', 'Cytoplasm/enzymology/pathology', 'DNA, Viral/analysis', 'Female', 'HTLV-I Infections/*complications/genetics/pathology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/*isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2 Receptor alpha Subunit/*analysis', 'Lymph Nodes/pathology/virology', 'Lymphoma, Large-Cell, Anaplastic/genetics/pathology/*virology', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', 'Translocation, Genetic']",,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (IL2RA protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-2 Receptor alpha Subunit)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ALK protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",,,"['R01 CA121935-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA082274-08/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA082274/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA112217-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA121935/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,['NIHMS125676'],,,,,,,,,,

Mechanisms of CGN-induced nuclear factor kappaB and interleukin-8 (IL-8) stimulation include an immune-mediated pathway involving toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and B-cell lymphoma/leukemia 10 (BCL10) and a reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated pathway. To determine how the structure of CGN contributes to its initiation of inflammation through these two distinct mechanisms, we treated CGNs with galactosidases and carrageenases (CGNases) and determined the impact on IL-8 secretion and BCL10 production. Hydrolysis of CGN by the enzyme alpha-1-->(3,6)-galactosidase significantly reduced increases in IL-8 and BCL10, but other galactosidases tested, including alpha-1-->6-galactosidase, beta-1-->4-galactosidase and beta-1-->3,6-galactosidase, had no effect. In contrast, specific kappa-CGNases or iota-CGNases, which hydrolyze beta-1,4-galactosidic bonds, produced increases in IL-8 and BCL10 attributable to increased exposure of the immunogenic alpha-1-->3-galactosidic epitope of CGN to TLR4. These results were consistent with induction of innate immune response by an interaction of TLR4 with the unusual alpha-d-Gal-(1-->3)-d-Gal epitope present in CGN. Activation of the ROS-mediated pathway was unaffected by treatment of kappa-CGN with either kappa-CGNase (3 mg/L), alpha-1-->(3,6)-galactosidase (20 mU/ml) or these enzymes in combination, indicating that changes in IL-8 production were attributable to the effects of induction of inflammation on the TLR4-BCL10-mediated innate immune pathway. These findings provide new information about the specificity of carbohydrate-protein interaction between CGN and TLR4 and may help to devise treatments that modify the immune reactivity induced by carbohydrate antigens.","['Bhattacharyya, Sumit', 'Liu, Haiying', 'Zhang, Zhenqing', 'Jam, Murielle', 'Dudeja, Pradeep K', 'Michel, Gurvan', 'Linhardt, Robert J', 'Tobacman, Joanne K']","['Bhattacharyya S', 'Liu H', 'Zhang Z', 'Jam M', 'Dudeja PK', 'Michel G', 'Linhardt RJ', 'Tobacman JK']","['Department of Medicine, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL 60612, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20091028,United States,J Nutr Biochem,The Journal of nutritional biochemistry,9010081,PMC2888704,2009/10/30 06:00,2011/02/01 06:00,['2009/10/30 06:00'],"['2009/04/13 00:00 [received]', '2009/06/26 00:00 [revised]', '2009/07/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/10/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/01 06:00 [medline]']","['S0955-2863(09)00152-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jnutbio.2009.07.002 [doi]']",ppublish,J Nutr Biochem. 2010 Oct;21(10):906-13. doi: 10.1016/j.jnutbio.2009.07.002.

The Wnt signaling pathway has been found to be extensively involved in cancer onset and progression but its role in BCP-ALL remains controversial. We evaluate the role of the Wnt pathway in maintenance of BCP-ALL cells and resistance to chemotherapy. Gene expression profile revealed that BCP-ALL cells are potentially sensitive to modulation of Wnt pathway. Nalm-16 and Nalm-6 cell lines displayed low levels of canonical activation, as reflected by the virtually complete absence of total beta-catenin in Nalm-6 and the beta-catenin cell membrane distribution in Nalm-16 cell line. Canonical activation with Wnt3a induced nuclear beta-catenin translocation and led to BCP-ALL cell death. Lithium chloride (LiCl) also induced a cytotoxic effect on leukemic cells. In contrast, both Wnt5a and Dkk-1 increased Nalm-16 cell survival. Also, Wnt3a enhanced the in vitro sensitivity of Nalm-16 to etoposide (VP-16) while treatment with canonical antagonists protected leukemic cells from chemotherapy-induced cell death. Overall, our results suggest that canonical activation of the Wnt pathway may exerts a tumor suppressive effect, thus its inhibition may support BCP-ALL cell survival.","['Thiago, L S', 'Costa, E S', 'Lopes, D V', 'Otazu, I B', 'Nowill, A E', 'Mendes, F A', 'Portilho, D M', 'Abreu, J G', 'Mermelstein, C S', 'Orfao, A', 'Rossi, M I D', 'Borojevic, R']","['Thiago LS', 'Costa ES', 'Lopes DV', 'Otazu IB', 'Nowill AE', 'Mendes FA', 'Portilho DM', 'Abreu JG', 'Mermelstein CS', 'Orfao A', 'Rossi MI', 'Borojevic R']","['Hospital Universitario Clementino Fraga Filho and Departamento de Histologia e Embriologia, Instituto de Ciencias Biomedicas, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. leandrothiago@terra.com.br']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091027,France,Biomed Pharmacother,Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,8213295,,2009/10/30 06:00,2010/02/25 06:00,['2009/10/30 06:00'],"['2009/01/20 00:00 [received]', '2009/09/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/10/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/25 06:00 [medline]']","['S0753-3322(09)00194-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.biopha.2009.09.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Biomed Pharmacother. 2010 Jan;64(1):63-72. doi: 10.1016/j.biopha.2009.09.005.

Antifungal prophylaxis posaconazole (P) is used during severe and prolonged neutropenia resulting from chemotherapy for acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), myelodysplastic syndrome and after autologous transplant. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We realized a retrospective study in order to assess the efficiency of P. Oral prophylaxy dosage is 200mg every eight hours to beginning before presumed neutropenia. Treatment failure was defined as the occurrence of proven/probable invasive fungal infections (IFI), receipt of any other systemic antifungal agent for suspected IFI or for impossible swallowing and the occurrence of adverse event. The objective is to note down the incidence of proven/probable IFI prevented by P. RESULTS: We included 22 patients of whom 86% suffered from AML. P was prescribed in IFI prophylaxies during prolonged and severe neutropenia postchemotherapy (72%) or postautologous transplant (28%) and initiated 7 days before neutropenia (50% of cases). The mean treatment period was 18 days. Colonization occurred in one third of patients (43% of Candida albicans). Esomeprazole (E) 40 mg was associated in 64% of cases. P prophylaxis failed in 50% of cases. Proven/probable IFI occurred in one case. Different failure causes were: suspected or possible IFI (n=5) and impossible swallowing (n=5). CONCLUSION: P prophylaxis seems to be efficient among these high-risk patients. However, a P tardive initiation, an E association, P administration and resorption difficulties seem to have a importance in successful treatment. It would be interesting to optimize P treatment with plasmatic dosages to ensure efficiency and safety for patients.","['Selvy, N', 'Villiet, M', 'Hansel-Esteller, S']","['Selvy N', 'Villiet M', 'Hansel-Esteller S']","['Service de pharmacie, CHRU de Montpellier, hopital Lapeyronie, 371, avenue du Doyen-Gaston-Giraud, 34295 Montpellier cedex 5, France.']",['fre'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",20091027,France,Pathol Biol (Paris),Pathologie-biologie,0265365,,2009/10/30 06:00,2010/08/13 06:00,['2009/10/30 06:00'],"['2009/07/02 00:00 [received]', '2009/07/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/10/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/13 06:00 [medline]']","['S0369-8114(09)00146-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.patbio.2009.07.016 [doi]']",ppublish,Pathol Biol (Paris). 2010 Apr;58(2):123-6. doi: 10.1016/j.patbio.2009.07.016.

However, the expression levels of these specific isoforms and their clinical relevance have not been studied to date. The real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction was established to detect each specific isoform of PML/RARalpha transcripts (bcr1/2, P46R3, P4R3, bcr3, and P2R3) in 46 APL patients. Whereas P46R3 and P4R3 isoforms were concurrently expressed in both bcr1- and bcr2-positive patients, P2R3 isoform was expressed only in bcr3-positive patients. A total of 13 patients had lower expression of bcr1/2 (median 11.60%, 0.86-108.51%) than that of P46R3 (median 14.26%, 6.03-222.91%; P = 0.001). The expression level of P4R3 (median 19.10%, 0.71-266.19%) was lower than the sum of bcr1/2 and P46R3 (median 37.94%, 9.62-403.51%) in all cases (P < 0.001). All 16 cases with bcr3 had concurrent low expression of P2R3 (P < 0.001). Structural analysis revealed that both P4R3 and P2R3 splicing resulting in the generation of a premature termination codon, which was recognized by nonsense-mediated decay (NMD). We suggest that alternative splicing of PML/RARalpha transcripts might be involved in NMD and each isoform should be quantified to further understand the pathogenesis of APL, stratify the risk of relapse, and monitor minimal residual disease.","['Lin, J', 'Han, L-X', 'Qian, J', 'Wang, Y-L', 'Yao, D-M', 'Qian, Z', 'Yang, X-F', 'Sheng, X-J']","['Lin J', 'Han LX', 'Qian J', 'Wang YL', 'Yao DM', 'Qian Z', 'Yang XF', 'Sheng XJ']","[""Department of Hematology, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091026,England,Int J Lab Hematol,International journal of laboratory hematology,101300213,,2009/10/30 06:00,2010/09/24 06:00,['2009/10/30 06:00'],"['2009/10/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/24 06:00 [medline]']","['CLH1190 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1751-553X.2009.01190.x [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Lab Hematol. 2010 Jun;32(3):344-50. doi: 10.1111/j.1751-553X.2009.01190.x.

Despite extensive investigation of the WNT genes expression profile in various tumors, little is known about their expression in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). In this study, the expression profile of 14 WNT genes was investigated in a large number of Iranian patients with CLL. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR was performed on peripheral blood leukemic cells obtained from 62 patients with CLL. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated from 11 age matched normal subjects served as control to determine baseline expression level of these genes. Our results have demonstrated significant up-regulation of WNT-3, WNT-4, WNT-5B, WNT-7B, WNT-9A, WNT-10A, and WNT-16B in patients with CLL compared to normal subjects (p < 0.05 to p < 0.0001). WNT gene expression analysis in different CLL subtypes showed a similar pattern of expression in progressive and indolent clinical subtypes. Over-expression of WNT-5A and WNT-9A genes was observed in patients with no mutation in their immunoglobulin (Ig) variable region heavy chain (Ig VH) genes compared to those with mutated Ig VH genes. Comparison between patients expressing VH1 (n = 9), VH3 (n = 40) and VH4 (n = 12) gene families, revealed down-regulation of WNT-3 and WNT-9A in VH3 positive patients. Our results indicate up-regulation of many members of the WNT gene family in CLL suggesting involvement of the Wnt canonical and/or noncanonical signaling pathways in CLL tumorigenesis.","['Memarian, Ali', 'Hojjat-Farsangi, Mohammad', 'Asgarian-Omran, Hossein', 'Younesi, Vahid', 'Jeddi-Tehrani, Mahmood', 'Sharifian, Ramazan Ali', 'Khoshnoodi, Jalal', 'Razavi, Seyed Mohsen', 'Rabbani, Hodjatallah', 'Shokri, Fazel']","['Memarian A', 'Hojjat-Farsangi M', 'Asgarian-Omran H', 'Younesi V', 'Jeddi-Tehrani M', 'Sharifian RA', 'Khoshnoodi J', 'Razavi SM', 'Rabbani H', 'Shokri F']","['Department of Immunology, School of Public Health, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,2009/10/30 06:00,2010/03/24 06:00,['2009/10/30 06:00'],"['2009/10/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/24 06:00 [medline]']","['10.3109/10428190903331082 [pii]', '10.3109/10428190903331082 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2009 Dec;50(12):2061-70. doi: 10.3109/10428190903331082.,12,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Protein Isoforms/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Wnt Proteins/*genetics', 'Wnt3 Protein', 'Wnt4 Protein']",,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (WNT10A protein, human)', '0 (WNT16 protein, human)', '0 (WNT3 protein, human)', '0 (WNT4 protein, human)', '0 (WNT5B protein, human)', '0 (WNT7B protein, human)', '0 (WNT9A protein, human)', '0 (Wnt Proteins)', '0 (Wnt3 Protein)', '0 (Wnt4 Protein)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The multidrug-resistant leukemia K562/ADM cell and its parental K562 cell were used as the model cells. The drug sensitivity was tested with a MTT assay. Flow cytometry was employed to detect the immunophenotype of stem cells and the expression of P-gp and BCRP. The self-renewal and proliferating potential were examined with methylcellulose colony-forming unit assay. RESULTS: K562/ADM cells were highly resistant to adriamycin, daunorubicin and etoposide. The amount of CD34+, CD123+ and CD34+ CD38- cells in K562/ADM cells was much higher than that in K562 cells, and the proportion of CD34+ CD38- CD123+ cells (LSC) in K562/ADM cells was (5.23 +/- 0.21)% versus (1.27 + 0.17)% in K562 cells, which was 4.12-fold higher than that in K562 cells. Both P-gp and BCRP were overexpressed in K562/ADM cells relative to K562 cells, and the K562/ADM cells coexpressing P-gp and BCRP were 11.25-fold higher over K562 cells. The proportion of CD34+ CD38- CD123+ BCRP+ and CD34+ CD38- P-gp+ BCRP+ cells in K562/ADM cells were (4.13 +/- 0.40)% and (5.80 +/- 1.19)% respectively, which were 3.66- and 11.37-fold higher than the same cells in K562 cells [(1.13 +/- 0.15)% and (0.51 +/- 0.01)%]. Furthermore, drug-resistant K562/ADM cells displayed 4.17-time greater colony-forming ability over the parent K562 cells, corresponding to the proportion of LSCs in K562/ADM cells. CONCLUSIONS: The ABC transporters-overexpressing LSC population exists in drug-resistant leukemic K562/ADM cells relative to drug-sensitive K562 cells, and the drug-resistant LSCs may be the source of chemotherapeutic resistance of leukemia.","['Yi, Juan', 'Chen, Jing', 'Sun, Jing', 'Wei, Hu-Lai']","['Yi J', 'Chen J', 'Sun J', 'Wei HL']","['Laboratory Center for Medical Science, School of Medicine, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, China.']",['chi'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,China,Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua yi xue za zhi,7511141,,2009/10/30 06:00,2010/03/10 06:00,['2009/10/30 06:00'],"['2009/10/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/10 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi. 2009 Jul 7;89(25):1741-4.,25,IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/metabolism', 'ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2', 'ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/metabolism', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Stem Cells/*metabolism']",,"['0 (ABCG2 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2)', '0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Transduction of primary murine hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells with retroviral vectors expressing TLX1 readily yields immortalized hematopoietic progenitor cell lines. Understanding the processes involved in TLX1-mediated cellular immortalization should yield insights into the growth and differentiation pathways altered by TLX1 during the development of T-ALL. In recent clinical gene therapy trials, hematopoietic clonal dominance or T-ALL-like diseases have occurred as a direct consequence of insertional activation of the EVI1, PRDM16 or LMO2 proto-oncogenes by the retroviral vectors used to deliver the therapeutic genes. Additionally, the generation of murine hematopoietic progenitor cell lines due to retroviral integrations into Evi1 or Prdm16 has also been recently reported. Here, we determined by linker-mediated nested polymerase chain reaction the integration sites in eight TLX1-immortalized hematopoietic cell lines. Notably, no common integration site was observed among the cell lines. Moreover, no insertions into the Evi1 or Prdm16 genes were identified although insertion near Lmo2 was observed in one instance. However, neither Lmo2 nor any of the other genes examined surrounding the integration sites showed differential vector-influenced expression compared to the cell lines lacking such insertions. While we cannot exclude the possibility that insertional side effects transiently provided a selective growth/survival advantage to the hematopoietic progenitor populations, our results unequivocally rule out insertions into Evi1 and Prdm16 as being integral to the TLX1-initiated immortalization process.","['Zweier-Renn, Lynnsey A', 'Hawley, Teresa S', 'Burkett, Sandra', 'Ramezani, Ali', 'Riz, Irene', 'Adler, Rima L', 'Hickstein, Dennis D', 'Hawley, Robert G']","['Zweier-Renn LA', 'Hawley TS', 'Burkett S', 'Ramezani A', 'Riz I', 'Adler RL', 'Hickstein DD', 'Hawley RG']","['Department of Anatomy and Regenerative Biology, The George Washington University, Washington, DC 20037, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,PMC2795049,2009/10/29 06:00,2010/02/25 06:00,['2009/10/29 06:00'],"['2009/10/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/gcc.20725 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2010 Feb;49(2):119-31. doi: 10.1002/gcc.20725.,2,IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology/physiology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Primers', 'Female', 'Genes, Homeobox', 'Genome-Wide Association Study', 'Hematopoiesis/*genetics', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/methods']",,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '143275-75-6 (TLX1 protein, human)']",,,"['R01HL65519/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL065519/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL066305/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States', 'R01HL66305/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL065519-08/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL066305-05/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,['NIHMS155591'],,,,,,,,,,

To the authors' knowledge, the course and prognosis of such patients is not well known. METHODS: A total of 1541 patients referred for remission induction chemotherapy of AML or high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS: A total of 120 (8%) patients developed acute pulmonary failure within 2 weeks of the initiation of chemotherapy; 87 of these patients (73%) died during remission induction, whereas 17 (14%) achieved a complete response. The median survival among the 120 patients with early acute pulmonary failure was 3 weeks. Predictive factors for the development of early acute pulmonary failure by multivariate analysis were: male sex (P = .00038), acute promyelocytic leukemia (P = .00003), poor performance status (P = .001), lung infiltrates at diagnosis (P = .000001), and increased creatinine (P = .000005). Patients who had 0 to 1, 2, 3, or 4 to 5 adverse factors were found to have estimated predictive incidences of acute pulmonary failure of 3%, 13%, 23%, and 34%, respectively.

Plasma concentrations of drug and metabolites and digital 12-lead ECGs were monitored for 23 h after dosing.

Mean (+/-SD) elimination half-life did not differ significantly between IV and oral dosage groups (11.3+/-4.0 vs 9.7+/-2.0 h, p=0.053).

Although benzene has for a long time been recognised as a carcinogen for humans, its mechanistic pathway remains unclear. Since mutations in the tumour suppressor gene TP53 are the most common genetic alterations involved in human cancer, our objective was to establish the first mutational pattern induced by benzene on the TP53 gene in human type II-like alveolar epithelial A549 cells by using the Functional Analysis of Separated Alleles in Yeast (FASAY). Seventeen mutations linked to benzene exposure were found: 3 one- or two-base deletions, and 14 single nucleotide substitutions (1 nonsense and 13 missense mutations). A>G and G>A transitions were the most prevalent (23.5% for both). Other mutations included A>C transversions and deletions (3/17, 17.6% for both), G>T transversions (2/17, 11.8%) and A>T transversions (1/17, 5.9%). Data arising from this benzene-induced mutational pattern affecting TP53, a critical target gene in human carcinogenesis, have been compared with those reported in human acute myeloid leukaemia, the aetiology of which is clearly linked to benzene exposure, and in experimental benzene-induced carcinoma. This comparison suggests that A>G transition could be a fingerprint of benzene exposure in tumours.

These ANAs include the ""multiple nuclear dots"" (MND) staining pattern, targeting promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) nuclear body (NB) components, such as ""speckled 100-kD"" protein (Sp100) and PML. A new PML NB protein, designated as Sp140, was identified using serum from a PBC patient. The aim of this study was to analyze the immune response against Sp140 protein in PBC patients. METHODS: We studied 135 PBC patients and 157 pathological controls with type 1 autoimmune hepatitis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, and systemic lupus erythematosus. We used indirect immunofluorescence and a neuroblastoma cell line expressing Sp140 for detecting anti-Sp140 antibodies, and a commercially available immunoblot for detecting anti-Sp100 and anti-PML antibodies. RESULTS: Anti-Sp140 antibodies were present in 20 (15%) PBC patients but not in control samples, with a higher frequency in antimitochondrial antibody (AMA)-negative cases (53 vs. 9%, P<0.0001). Anti-Sp140 antibodies were found together with anti-Sp100 antibodies in all but one case (19 of 20, 90%) and with anti-PML antibodies in 12 (60%) cases. Anti-Sp140 positivity was not associated with a specific clinical feature of PBC. CONCLUSIONS: Our study identifies Sp140 as a new, highly specific autoantigen in PBC for the first time. The very frequent coexistence of anti-Sp140, anti-Sp100 and anti-PML antibodies suggests that the NB is a multiantigenic complex in PBC and enhances the diagnostic significance of these reactivities, which are particularly useful in AMA-negative cases.","['Granito, Alessandro', 'Yang, Wei-Hong', 'Muratori, Luigi', 'Lim, Mark J', 'Nakajima, Ayako', 'Ferri, Silvia', 'Pappas, Georgios', 'Quarneti, Chiara', 'Bianchi, Francesco B', 'Bloch, Donald B', 'Muratori, Paolo']","['Granito A', 'Yang WH', 'Muratori L', 'Lim MJ', 'Nakajima A', 'Ferri S', 'Pappas G', 'Quarneti C', 'Bianchi FB', 'Bloch DB', 'Muratori P']","['Dipartimento di Medicina Clinica, Alma Mater Studiorum University of Bologna, Italy. alessandro.granito@unibo.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20091027,United States,Am J Gastroenterol,The American journal of gastroenterology,0421030,,2009/10/29 06:00,2010/02/26 06:00,['2009/10/29 06:00'],"['2009/10/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/26 06:00 [medline]']","['ajg2009596 [pii]', '10.1038/ajg.2009.596 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Gastroenterol. 2010 Jan;105(1):125-31. doi: 10.1038/ajg.2009.596.

This study aimed to determine the most appropriate reference genes for normalizing gene expressions in lymphatic tissue, represented by non-neoplastic lymph nodes and diffuse large B-cell lymphomas, by using 2 statistical software applications, geNorm and NormFinder. In addition, we wanted to validate the usefulness of paraffin-embedded samples for Q-RT-PCR studies by investigating gene expressions of relevant target genes in paired frozen and paraffin-embedded samples. Moreover, we studied the impact of amplicon sizes on the efficiency of Q-RT-PCR in paraffin-embedded tissues. Six putative reference genes were tested for stability of expression in 21 pairs of snap-frozen and formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded lymph nodes and lymphomas. The genes were ranked according to their suitability as reference genes. According to both statistical approaches, beta-glucoronidase was the single most appropriate reference gene in both snap-frozen and paraffin-embedded samples. TATA box-binding protein gene and Abelson murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog 1 gene were also highly ranked by both programs. In addition, we measured the relative expressions of 7 target genes by Q-RT-PCR, using PCR primer-probes with amplicon sizes up to 105 bases. The correlation coefficient for expression measured in matched frozen and paraffin-embedded samples was 0.93 (P<0.01) after normalization with the appropriate reference genes. Thus, we show that formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded lymphoid samples are suitable for Q-RT-PCR when using thoroughly validated reference genes.","['Green, Tina Marie', 'de Stricker, Karin', 'Moller, Michael Boe']","['Green TM', 'de Stricker K', 'Moller MB']","['Department of Pathology, Odense University Hospital, Odense, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Validation Study']",,United States,Diagn Mol Pathol,"Diagnostic molecular pathology : the American journal of surgical pathology, part B",9204924,,2009/10/29 06:00,2010/01/27 06:00,['2009/10/29 06:00'],"['2009/10/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/PDM.0b013e3181a06f42 [doi]'],ppublish,Diagn Mol Pathol. 2009 Dec;18(4):243-9. doi: 10.1097/PDM.0b013e3181a06f42.,4,IM,"['DNA, Complementary/metabolism', '*Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling/*methods/standards', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genes, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Humans', '*Lymph Nodes', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/*genetics/pathology', 'Molecular Diagnostic Techniques/standards', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods/standards']",,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In 2001 the International Agency for Research on Cancer defined 50-60 Hz magnetic fields as ""possibly carcinogenic to humans"" because of the ""limited evidence"" of carcinogenicity of residential exposure relatively to childhood leukemia. With respect to health effects other than cancer, namely neurodegenerative disorders, miscarriage, subtle differences in the timing of melatonin release, altered autonomic control of the heart, and changes in the number of natural killer cells, some open questions still remain. Several authors recommended further investigation of the possible long-term effects of magnetic fields, focussing on populations experiencing high exposure levels. In this frame a research team of ISS searched for a suitable location to implement an epidemiological study aimed at a wide range of outcomes for which a priori hypotheses could be formulated. The recently published findings of this project showed an increase of primary and secondary malignant neoplasms, ischaemic disease and haematological diseases. Future studies should thus address the most exposed sectors of the population, take into account different outcomes (all neoplasms, neurodegenerative diseases, immunological disorders, specific cardiovascular effects) and follow research protocols that enable subsequent pooled analyses. A precautionary approach may provide the frame for decision making where the available resources for environmental remediation be prioritatively allocated to worst-off situations.","['Comba, Pietro', 'Fazzo, Lucia']","['Comba P', 'Fazzo L']",,['eng'],"['Letter', 'Review']",,Italy,Ann Ist Super Sanita,Annali dell'Istituto superiore di sanita,7502520,,2009/10/29 06:00,2010/01/06 06:00,['2009/10/29 06:00'],"['2009/10/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/06 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Ann Ist Super Sanita. 2009;45(3):233-7.,3,IM,"['*Electric Power Supplies', '*Electromagnetic Fields', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Humans', '*Public Health']",31,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we show that retroviral expression of Hes1 immortalizes common myeloid progenitors (CMPs) and granulocyte-macrophage progenitors (GMPs) in the presence of interleukin-3, conferring permanent replating capability on these cells. Whereas these cells did not develop myeloproliferative neoplasms when intravenously administered to irradiated mice, the combination of Hes1 and BCR-ABL in CMPs and GMPs caused acute leukemia resembling blast crisis of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), resulting in rapid death of the recipient mice. On the other hand, BCR-ABL alone caused CML-like disease when expressed in c-Kit-positive, Sca-1-positive, and lineage-negative hematopoietic stem cells (KSLs), but not committed progenitors CMPs or GMPs, as previously reported. Leukemic cells derived from Hes1 and BCR-ABL-expressing CMPs and GMPs were more immature than those derived from BCR-ABL-expressing KSLs. Intriguingly, Hes1 was highly expressed in 8 of 20 patients with CML in blast crisis, but not in the chronic phase, and dominant negative Hes1 retarded the growth of some CML cell lines expressing Hes1.

Asx is unusual because it is required to maintain both activation and silencing of Hox genes in flies and mice. Asxl proteins are characterized by an amino terminal homology domain, by interaction domains for nuclear receptors, and by a C-terminal plant homeodomain protein-protein interaction domain. A recent study of patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) revealed a high incidence of truncation mutations that would delete the PHD domain of ASXL1. Here, we show that Asxl1 is expressed in all hematopoietic cell fractions analyzed. Asxl1 knockout mice exhibit defects in frequency of differentiation of lymphoid and myeloid progenitors, but not in multipotent progenitors. We do not detect effects on hematopoietic stem cells, or in peripheral blood. Notably, we do not detect severe myelodysplastic phenotypes or leukemia in this loss-of-function model. We conclude that Asxl1 is needed for normal hematopoiesis. The mild phenotypes observed may be because other Asxl genes have redundant function with Asxl1, or alternatively, MDS or oncogenic phenotypes may result from gain-of-function Asxl mutations caused by genomic amplification, gene fusion, or truncation of Asxl1.","['Fisher, Cynthia L', 'Pineault, Nicolas', 'Brookes, Christy', 'Helgason, Cheryl D', 'Ohta, Hideaki', 'Bodner, Caroline', 'Hess, Jay L', 'Humphries, R Keith', 'Brock, Hugh W']","['Fisher CL', 'Pineault N', 'Brookes C', 'Helgason CD', 'Ohta H', 'Bodner C', 'Hess JL', 'Humphries RK', 'Brock HW']","['Department of Zoology, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091027,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,PMC2803690,2009/10/29 06:00,2010/01/22 06:00,['2009/10/29 06:00'],"['2009/10/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/22 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)30105-1 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2009-07-230698 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 Jan 7;115(1):38-46. doi: 10.1182/blood-2009-07-230698.

Normal and malignant tissues often show asynchronies in cell proliferation and metabolic rhythms. Cancer chronotherapy takes biological time into account to improve the therapy. However, alterations of the circadian clock machinery genes have rarely been reported in human cancer. Herein, we show that the BMAL1 gene, a core component of the circadian clock, is transcriptionally silenced by promoter CpG island hypermethylation in hematologic malignancies, such as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and acute lymphocytic and myeloid leukemias. We also describe how BMAL1 reintroduction in hypermethylated leukemia/lymphoma cells causes growth inhibition in colony assays and nude mice, whereas BMAL1 depletion by RNA interference in unmethylated cells enhances tumor growth. We also show that BMAL1 epigenetic inactivation impairs the characteristic circadian clock expression pattern of genes such as C-MYC, catalase, and p300 in association with a loss of BMAL1 occupancy in their respective promoters. Furthermore, the DNA hypermethylation-associated loss of BMAL1 also prevents the recruitment of its natural partner, the CLOCK protein, to their common targets, further enhancing the perturbed circadian rhythm of the malignant cells. These findings suggest that BMAL1 epigenetic inactivation contributes to the development of hematologic malignancies by disrupting the cellular circadian clock.","['Taniguchi, Hiroaki', 'Fernandez, Agustin F', 'Setien, Fernando', 'Ropero, Santiago', 'Ballestar, Esteban', 'Villanueva, Alberto', 'Yamamoto, Hiroyuki', 'Imai, Kohzoh', 'Shinomura, Yasuhisa', 'Esteller, Manel']","['Taniguchi H', 'Fernandez AF', 'Setien F', 'Ropero S', 'Ballestar E', 'Villanueva A', 'Yamamoto H', 'Imai K', 'Shinomura Y', 'Esteller M']","[""Bellvitge Biomedical Research Institute, l'Hospitalet, and Institucio Catalana de Recerca i Estudis Avancats, Catalonia, Spain.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091027,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,,2009/10/29 06:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/10/29 06:00'],"['2009/10/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['0008-5472.CAN-09-0551 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-09-0551 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2009 Nov 1;69(21):8447-54. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-09-0551.

Several parameters have prognostic capabilities but are associated with altered response to therapy in only a small subset of patients. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We used gene expression profiling methods to generate predictors of therapy response and prognosis. Genomic signatures that reflect progressive disease and responses to chemotherapy or chemoimmunotherapy were created using cancer cell lines and patient leukemia cell samples. We validated and applied these three signatures to independent clinical data from four cohorts, representing a total of 301 CLL patients. RESULTS: A genomic signature of prognosis created from patient leukemic cell gene expression data coupled with clinical parameters significantly differentiated patients with stable disease from those with progressive disease in the training data set. The progression signature was validated in two independent data sets, showing a capacity to accurately identify patients at risk for progressive disease. In addition, genomic signatures that predict response to chlorambucil or pentostatin, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab were generated and could accurately distinguish responding and nonresponding CLL patients. CONCLUSIONS: Thus, microarray analysis of CLL lymphocytes can be used to refine prognosis and predict response to different therapies. These results have implications for standard and investigational therapeutics in CLL patients.","['Friedman, Daphne R', 'Weinberg, J Brice', 'Barry, William T', 'Goodman, Barbara K', 'Volkheimer, Alicia D', 'Bond, Karen M', 'Chen, Youwei', 'Jiang, Ning', 'Moore, Joseph O', 'Gockerman, Jon P', 'Diehl, Louis F', 'Decastro, Carlos M', 'Potti, Anil', 'Nevins, Joseph R']","['Friedman DR', 'Weinberg JB', 'Barry WT', 'Goodman BK', 'Volkheimer AD', 'Bond KM', 'Chen Y', 'Jiang N', 'Moore JO', 'Gockerman JP', 'Diehl LF', 'Decastro CM', 'Potti A', 'Nevins JR']","['Divisions of Hematology, Oncology, and Cellular Therapy, Duke Institute for Genome Sciences and Policy, Durham VA Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20091027,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,PMC2783430,2009/10/29 06:00,2010/03/23 06:00,['2009/10/29 06:00'],"['2009/10/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/23 06:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-09-1132 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-09-1132 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2009 Nov 15;15(22):6947-55. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-09-1132.

We recently reported an association of DHFR promoter polymorphisms with ALL outcome. Lower event-free survival correlated with haplotype *1, defined by A(-317) and C(-1610) alleles. Haplotype *1 was also associated higher DHFR expression. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Here, we analyzed adjacent 400-bp region participating in DHFR regulation as both a major promoter and a noncoding minor transcript. RESULTS: Six polymorphisms were identified, of which five were single nucleotide polymorphisms and one was length polymorphism composed of variable number of 9-bp elements and 9-bp insertion/deletion. Haplotype analysis including all promoter polymorphisms revealed diversification of haplotype *1 into five subtypes (*1a-*1e). DNA variations of major promoter/noncoding transcript region and haplotype *1 subtypes were subsequently analyzed for the association with ALL outcome. Lower event-free survival was associated with an A allele of G(308)A polymorphism (P = 0.02) and with *1b haplotype (P = 0.01). This association was particularly striking in high-risk patients (P = 0.001) and was subsequently confirmed in independent patient cohort (P = 0.02). Haplotype *1b was the only haplotype *1 subtype associated with higher mRNA levels. CONCLUSIONS: The study provides a new insight into DHFR regulatory variations predisposing to an event in ALL patients.","['Al-Shakfa, Fidaa', 'Dulucq, Stephanie', 'Brukner, Ivan', 'Milacic, Iva', 'Ansari, Marc', 'Beaulieu, Patrick', 'Moghrabi, Albert', 'Laverdiere, Caroline', 'Sallan, Stephen E', 'Silverman, Lewis B', 'Neuberg, Donna', 'Kutok, Jeffery L', 'Sinnett, Daniel', 'Krajinovic, Maja']","['Al-Shakfa F', 'Dulucq S', 'Brukner I', 'Milacic I', 'Ansari M', 'Beaulieu P', 'Moghrabi A', 'Laverdiere C', 'Sallan SE', 'Silverman LB', 'Neuberg D', 'Kutok JL', 'Sinnett D', 'Krajinovic M']","['Research Center, CHU Sainte-Justine, University of Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20091027,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,,2009/10/29 06:00,2010/03/23 06:00,['2009/10/29 06:00'],"['2009/10/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/23 06:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-09-0641 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-09-0641 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2009 Nov 15;15(22):6931-8. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-09-0641.

In this study we show that nesprin-2 is a novel extracellular signal-regulated MAPK1 and 2 (ERK1/2) scaffold protein that serves to regulate nuclear signaling by tethering these kinases at promyelocytic leukemia protein nuclear bodies (PML NBs). Using immunofluorescence microscopy, GST pull-down and immunoprecipitation, we show that nesprin-2, ERK1/2, and PML colocalize and bind to form a nuclear complex. Interference of nesprin-2 function, by either siRNA-mediated knockdown or overexpression of a dominant negative nesprin-2 fragment, augmented ERK1/2 nuclear signaling shown by increased SP1 activity and ELK1 phosphorylation. The functional outcome of nesprin-2 disruption and the resultant sustained ERK1/2 signal was increased proliferation. Importantly, these activities were not induced by previously identified nuclear envelope (NE)-targeted nesprin-2 isoforms but rather were mediated by novel nuclear isoforms that lacked the KASH domain. Taken together, this study suggests that nesprin-2 is a novel intranuclear scaffold, essential for nuclear ERK1/2 signaling fidelity and cell cycle progression.","['Warren, Derek T', 'Tajsic, Tamara', 'Mellad, Jason A', 'Searles, Richelle', 'Zhang, Qiuping', 'Shanahan, Catherine M']","['Warren DT', 'Tajsic T', 'Mellad JA', 'Searles R', 'Zhang Q', 'Shanahan CM']","[""British Heart Foundation Centre, Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, King's College London, London SE5 9NU, United Kingdom. derek.warren@kcl.ac.uk""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091027,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,PMC2801258,2009/10/29 06:00,2010/01/27 06:00,['2009/10/29 06:00'],"['2009/10/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/27 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)58886-8 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M109.032557 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2010 Jan 8;285(2):1311-20. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M109.032557.

Recently, a novel outcome was postulated for low FeLV infectious doses. Naive cats exposed to faeces of persistently infected cats seroconverted, indicating infection, but remained negative for provirus and p27 antigen in blood. FeLV provirus was found in some tissues but not in the bone marrow, infection of which is usually considered a necessary stage for disease progression. To investigate the impact of low FeLV doses on young cats and to test the hypothesis that low dose exposure may lead to an unknown pathogenesis of infection without involvement of the bone marrow, 21 cats were infected oronasally with variable viral doses. Blood p27, proviral and viral loads were followed until week 20 post-infection. Tissue proviral loads were determined as well. The immune response was monitored by measuring FeLV whole virus and p45 antibodies; and feline oncornavirus-associated cell membrane antigen (FOCMA) assay. One cat showed regressive infection (transient antigenemia, persistent provirus-positivity, and seroconversion) with provirus only found in some organs at sacrifice. In 7 of the 20 remaining cats FOCMA assay positivity was the only sign of infection, while all other tests were negative. Overall, the results show that FeLV low dose exposure can result in seroconversion during a presumed abortive infection. Therefore, commonly used detection methods do not detect all FeLV-infected animals, possibly leading to an underestimation of the prevalence of infection.","['Major, Andrea', 'Cattori, Valentino', 'Boenzli, Eva', 'Riond, Barbara', 'Ossent, Peter', 'Meli, Marina Luisa', 'Hofmann-Lehmann, Regina', 'Lutz, Hans']","['Major A', 'Cattori V', 'Boenzli E', 'Riond B', 'Ossent P', 'Meli ML', 'Hofmann-Lehmann R', 'Lutz H']","['Clinical Laboratory, Vetsuisse Faculty, University of Zurich, Winterthurerstrasse 260, 8057, Zurich, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091028,England,Vet Res,Veterinary research,9309551,PMC2789331,2009/10/29 06:00,2010/05/01 06:00,['2009/10/29 06:00'],"['2009/07/15 00:00 [received]', '2009/10/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/10/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/01 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1051/vetres/2009065 [doi]', 'v09456 [pii]']",ppublish,Vet Res. 2010 Mar-Apr;41(2):17. doi: 10.1051/vetres/2009065.

The aim of the study was analysis of TPN of young patients in the HSCT period. Twenty-two patients 1.8-20.8 year-old, median 5.4, treated with high-dose therapy and autologous HSCT because of malignancy were included into the study. Grafts contained 1.35-7.9 x 106, median 3.75 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg. Engraftment occurred as follows: granulocytes >0.5 x 109/l on +11 d (8-25); platelets >20 x 109/l on +23 d (12-67). Patients were given isoenergetic, isonitrogenous TPN until they consumed less than 50 % of their required diet orally. Proteins intake was 0.8-2.0 g/kg per d, fats intake 1.0-3.0 g/kg per d. Total non-proteins energies-nitrogen grams index was 140:1-200:1. Supplementation of electrolytes, microelements, trace elements and vitamins was dependent on individual patient requirement. TPN duration did not correlate with CD34+ cells number but correlated with platelets reconstitution. The assessment of nutritional condition demonstrated no differences in anthropometric parameters, but increase of serum albumin levels after TPN. Requirement for P3 - was above the normal ranges and correlated positively with platelets reconstitution. Requirement for P3 - and K+ was higher in patients with mucositis than in other patients. Any complications due to TPN were observed. Adequately composed isoenergetic and isonitrogenous TPN with replacement of electrolytes according to their requirement in the early post-transplantation period allows not only improvement in nutritional status of patients but also could contribute to reconstitution of haematopoiesis.","['Wedrychowicz, Anna', 'Spodaryk, Mikolaj', 'Krasowska-Kwiecien, Aleksandra', 'Gozdzik, Jolanta']","['Wedrychowicz A', 'Spodaryk M', 'Krasowska-Kwiecien A', 'Gozdzik J']","[""Transplantation Centre, University Children's Hospital, Cracow, Poland. miniedzw@cyf-kr.edu.pl""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20091028,England,Br J Nutr,The British journal of nutrition,0372547,,2009/10/29 06:00,2010/04/02 06:00,['2009/10/29 06:00'],"['2009/10/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/02 06:00 [medline]']","['S000711450999242X [pii]', '10.1017/S000711450999242X [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Nutr. 2010 Mar;103(6):899-906. doi: 10.1017/S000711450999242X.

The established involvement of mTOR activity in the cellular processes that contribute to the development and progression of cancer has identified mTOR as a major link in tumorigenesis. Consequently, inhibitors of mTOR, including temsirolimus, everolimus, and ridaforolimus (formerly deforolimus) have been developed and assessed for their safety and efficacy in patients with cancer. Temsirolimus is an intravenously administered agent approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) for the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Everolimus is an oral agent that has recently obtained US FDA and EMEA approval for the treatment of advanced RCC after failure of treatment with sunitinib or sorafenib. Ridaforolimus is not yet approved for any indication. The use of mTOR inhibitors, either alone or in combination with other anticancer agents, has the potential to provide anticancer activity in numerous tumor types. Cancer types in which these agents are under evaluation include neuroendocrine tumors, breast cancer, leukemia, lymphoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, gastric cancer, pancreatic cancer, sarcoma, endometrial cancer, and non-small-cell lung cancer. The results of ongoing clinical trials with mTOR inhibitors, as single agents and in combination regimens, will better define their activity in cancer.","['Yuan, Ruirong', 'Kay, Andrea', 'Berg, William J', 'Lebwohl, David']","['Yuan R', 'Kay A', 'Berg WJ', 'Lebwohl D']","['Novartis Oncology, Florham Park, NJ, USA. yuanru@umdnj.edu']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20091027,England,J Hematol Oncol,Journal of hematology & oncology,101468937,PMC2775749,2009/10/29 06:00,2010/06/16 06:00,['2009/10/29 06:00'],"['2009/08/14 00:00 [received]', '2009/10/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/10/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/16 06:00 [medline]']","['1756-8722-2-45 [pii]', '10.1186/1756-8722-2-45 [doi]']",epublish,J Hematol Oncol. 2009 Oct 27;2:45. doi: 10.1186/1756-8722-2-45.,,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage/chemical synthesis', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*drug effects/pathology', 'Drug Delivery Systems/*methods', '*Drug Discovery/methods', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/physiology', 'Models, Biological', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/etiology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/administration & dosage/chemical synthesis', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/physiology', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases']",103,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, these patients suffer not only from MC infiltration and consecutive organ damage but also from MC mediator-related symptoms. METHODS: We examined the effects of three KIT TKI, imatinib, nilotinib, and midostaurin, on IgE-dependent mediator release in normal human blood basophils and cultured cord blood cell-derived MC, and on spontaneous histamine secretion in the MC leukaemia cell line HMC-1 and the basophil cell line KU812. RESULTS: The multi-kinase inhibitor midostaurin that interacts with KIT and protein kinase C was found to counteract anti-IgE-induced mediator release in blood basophils and cultured cord blood cell-derived MC in all samples examined. By contrast, no effects of imatinib or nilotinib on histamine secretion in basophils or MC were found. The effects of midostaurin on histamine release were dose-dependent and occurred at pharmacologic concentrations (IC(50) 10-100 nm). Midostaurin was also found to inhibit the IgE-dependent up-regulation of CD63 on cultured cord blood cell-derived human MC, but did not inhibit IgE-dependent up-regulation of CD63 or CD203c in human blood basophils. CONCLUSION: Midostaurin may be a beneficial drug in aggressive systemic mastocytosis not only because of its growth-inhibitory effects but also because of its additional effects on activation and mediator release in MC and basophils.","['Krauth, M-T', 'Mirkina, I', 'Herrmann, H', 'Baumgartner, C', 'Kneidinger, M', 'Valent, P']","['Krauth MT', 'Mirkina I', 'Herrmann H', 'Baumgartner C', 'Kneidinger M', 'Valent P']","['Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Clin Exp Allergy,Clinical and experimental allergy : journal of the British Society for Allergy and Clinical Immunology,8906443,,2009/10/29 06:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/10/29 06:00'],"['2009/10/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['CEA3353 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2222.2009.03353.x [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Exp Allergy. 2009 Nov;39(11):1711-20. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2222.2009.03353.x.,11,IM,"['Antigens, CD/biosynthesis', 'Basophils/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin E/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Inflammation Mediators/*metabolism', 'Mast Cells/*metabolism', 'Mastocytosis, Systemic/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Phosphoric Diester Hydrolases/biosynthesis', 'Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins/biosynthesis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Pyrophosphatases/biosynthesis', 'Staurosporine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Tetraspanin 30', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD63 protein, human)', '0 (ENPP3 protein, human)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Inflammation Mediators)', '0 (Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Tetraspanin 30)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 3.1.4.- (Phosphoric Diester Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (Pyrophosphatases)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)', 'ID912S5VON (midostaurin)']",,,['P 21173/FWF_/Austrian Science Fund FWF/Austria'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

About 50% of patients with HL relapsed after or refractory to first-line therapy achieve a durable response after peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT). Patients relapsing after a PBSCT (performed as second line therapy) have a very poor prognosis. We evaluated the efficacy of BEACOPP in two settings: patients refractory or in relapse after first-line therapy (Group A) and patients relapsing after a PBSCT (Group B). Twenty-three patients with HL, admitted between February 2003 and April 2007, were retrospectively studied: 10 patients in Group A and 13 in Group B. Group A: Nine complete remissions (CR) and one partial remission (PR) were achieved following BEACOPP treatment. After a median follow-up of 32 months, one patient has died due to secondary leukemia, while the other eight are alive, five (50%) in second CR, three in third CR after PBSCT and one with disease. Group B: Eight of the 13 patients (62%) obtained a CR, one patient a PR, two were refractory and two have died of toxicity. To date, eight patients (62%) are alive, four (31%) still in CR. All patients experienced hematologic toxicity (WHO 3-4) with two deaths due to septic shock. These results show that BEACOPP is an effective regimen for both refractory/relapsed patients with HL after first-line treatment (Group A) and for patients relapsing after a PBSCT (Group B) with a 3-year probability of overall survival, progression-free survival, and cumulative incidence of relapse of 90, 50, and 33.3% in Group A, and 61, 31, and 37.5% in Group B, respectively.","['Cavalieri, Elena', 'Matturro, Angela', 'Annechini, Giorgia', 'De Angelis, Federico', 'Frattarelli, Natalia', 'Gentilini, Fabiana', 'Grapulin, Lavinia', 'Sacco, Mikael', 'Torelli, Fabio', 'Vignetti, Marco', 'Mandelli, Franco', 'Foa, Robin', 'Pulsoni, Alessandro']","['Cavalieri E', 'Matturro A', 'Annechini G', 'De Angelis F', 'Frattarelli N', 'Gentilini F', 'Grapulin L', 'Sacco M', 'Torelli F', 'Vignetti M', 'Mandelli F', 'Foa R', 'Pulsoni A']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology, Sapienza University, Rome, Italy. cavalieri@bce.uniroma1.it']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,2009/10/29 06:00,2010/02/03 06:00,['2009/10/29 06:00'],"['2009/10/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/03 06:00 [medline]']","['10.3109/10428190903254383 [pii]', '10.3109/10428190903254383 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2009 Nov;50(11):1803-8. doi: 10.3109/10428190903254383.,11,IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Aspergillosis/chemically induced', 'Bleomycin/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Hodgkin Disease/*drug therapy/surgery', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pericarditis/chemically induced', 'Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Pneumonia/chemically induced', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Procarbazine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Shock, Septic/chemically induced', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Young Adult']",,"['11056-06-7 (Bleomycin)', '35S93Y190K (Procarbazine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)']",,,,['Leuk Lymphoma. 2009 Nov;50(11):1733-4.

However, the genetic association studies that examined the relation between the null genotypes of GSTM1 and GSTT1 genes and risk of developing CML gave conflicting or inconclusive results. In an attempt to interpret these results, a meta-analysis of all available studies (nine studies, with 757 cases and 1959 controls) was performed. In the meta-analysis the pooled odds ratios (OR) were estimated using random effects models. The heterogeneity between studies, the sources of potential bias, and the consistency of genetic effects across ethnicities were explored. Cumulative meta-analysis was also performed. Overall, the meta-analysis showed nonsignificant association between GSTM1 null genotype and CML (OR = 1.00 [0.83-1.20]) and lack of heterogeneity between the studies (p(Q) = 0.87). The association was also nonsignificant in Whites, East Asians, and Indians: OR = 1.38 (0.43-4.46), 0.94 (0.65-1.35), and 1.16 (0.74-1.82), respectively. However, GSTT1 null genotype was associated with increased risk of CML (OR = 1.57 [1.13-2.17]) and the heterogeneity between studies was significant (p(Q) = 0.04). In Indians, the association was significant (OR = 2.89 [1.56-5.35]) whereas in East Asians it was not significant (OR = 1.07 [0.74-1.54]). The combined GSTM1 normal/GSTT1 null genotypes produced significant association (OR = 1.95 [1.17-3.24]). Cumulative meta-analysis for GSTT1 gene showed an upward trend in risk effect, whereas the trend was downward in GSTM1. There was a differential magnitude of effect in large versus small studies. In conclusion, the accumulated evidence indicated an association between GSTT1 null genotype and CML.","['Zintzaras, Elias']",['Zintzaras E'],"['Department of Biomathematics, University of Thessaly School of Medicine, Larissa, Greece. zintza@med.uth.gr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis']",,United States,Genet Test Mol Biomarkers,Genetic testing and molecular biomarkers,101494210,,2009/10/29 06:00,2010/02/05 06:00,['2009/10/29 06:00'],"['2009/10/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/gtmb.2009.0079 [doi]'],ppublish,Genet Test Mol Biomarkers. 2009 Dec;13(6):791-7. doi: 10.1089/gtmb.2009.0079.,6,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', '*Genetic Association Studies', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Glutathione Transferase/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Young Adult']",,"['EC 2.5.1.- (glutathione S-transferase T1)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (glutathione S-transferase M1)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its incidence is increasing rapidly and reaching epidemic proportions. When detected early, it is considered curable, but when detected at later stages it is arguably one of the most lethal malignancies and is the cause of more years of lost life than any other cancer except leukemia. Because most cutaneous melanomas are visible, however, melanoma in general is a cancer highly amenable to early detection. Surgery is standard treatment for localized melanoma. There is no standard therapy for advanced-stage melanoma. Metastatic melanoma disseminates widely and it frequently involves sites that are not commonly affected in other cancers, such as the gastrointestinal tract and skin. The median survival time for patients with metastatic melanoma is less than 1 year. Despite these grim statistics, long-term survival occurs occasionally. This article will review diagnosis, staging, and treatment for malignant melanoma and will discuss the nursing role in the care of patients with melanoma.","['Rubin, Krista M', 'Lawrence, Donald P']","['Rubin KM', 'Lawrence DP']","['Melanoma Disease Program, Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Oncology (Williston Park),"Oncology (Williston Park, N.Y.)",8712059,,2009/10/29 06:00,2009/11/13 06:00,['2009/10/29 06:00'],"['2009/10/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/11/13 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Oncology (Williston Park). 2009 Jul;23(8 Suppl):13-21.,8 Suppl,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Early Detection of Cancer', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy', 'Lymph Node Excision', 'Melanoma/*diagnosis/epidemiology/etiology/*therapy', 'Neoplasm Staging/methods', ""Nurse's Role"", 'Nursing Assessment', 'Oncology Nursing/*organization & administration', 'Patient Education as Topic', 'Physical Examination', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Factors', 'Skin Neoplasms/*diagnosis/epidemiology/etiology/*therapy', 'United States/epidemiology']",29,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],,,,['Oncology (Williston Park). 2009 Jul;23(8 Suppl):22.

Pediatric patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) have frequent episodes of fever necessitating the use of antibiotics such as cefepime. We evaluated the association of cefepime and other beta-lactam antibiotic exposures with all cause in-hospital mortality in pediatric AML patients. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study using the Pediatric Health Information System, an inpatient database. Exposure to cefepime, ceftazidime, antipseudomonal penicillin, and carbapenems was evaluated for each 30-day period within the first year from AML diagnosis. Cox regression analysis was used to compute hazard ratios (HR) for death adjusting for demographics, clinical variables, and clustering by hospital. The final analysis used 2 distinct time periods (0-3 months and >3-12 months) to account for variation in proportional hazards over time. RESULTS: No differences between the HRs for mortality were observed for the time period of 0 to 3 months (cefepime vs. ceftazadime: HR=1.33, 95% CI: 0.70-2.52; cefepime vs. antipseudmonal penicillin: HR=0.86, 95% CI: 0.34-2.13; and cefepime vs. carbapenems: HR=1.08, 95% CI: 0.50-2.35) or the time period of >3 to 12 months after diagnosis (cefepime vs. ceftazadime: HR=1.29, 95% CI: 0.53-3.15; cefepime vs. antipseudomonal penicillin: HR=1.08, 95% CI: 0.44-2.66; and cefepime vs. carbapenems: HR=1.03, 95% CI: 0.45-2.33). CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort of pediatric AML patients, cefepime exposure in the 30 days preceding death did not result in an increased mortality risk when compared with ceftazidime, antipseudomonal penicillins, or carbapenems.","['Fisher, Brian T', 'Aplenc, Richard', 'Localio, Russell', 'Leckerman, Kateri H', 'Zaoutis, Theoklis E']","['Fisher BT', 'Aplenc R', 'Localio R', 'Leckerman KH', 'Zaoutis TE']","[""Division of Infectious Diseases, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, and Department of Pediatrics, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA. fisherbria@email.chop.edu""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Pediatr Infect Dis J,The Pediatric infectious disease journal,8701858,,2009/10/28 06:00,2010/02/27 06:00,['2009/10/28 06:00'],"['2009/10/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/27 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/INF.0b013e3181a75939 [doi]', '00006454-200911000-00009 [pii]']",ppublish,Pediatr Infect Dis J. 2009 Nov;28(11):971-5. doi: 10.1097/INF.0b013e3181a75939.,11,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Animals', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Cefepime', 'Cephalosporins/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*complications', 'Male', 'Opportunistic Infections/*drug therapy/epidemiology/*mortality', 'Retrospective Studies']",,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Cephalosporins)', '807PW4VQE3 (Cefepime)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We reviewed studies of workers exposed to styrene in manufacturing and polymerization, in the reinforced plastics industry, and in styrene-butadiene rubber production. We also reviewed studies of workers monitored for styrene exposure, studies of environmental exposure, community-based case-control studies of lymphoma and leukemia, and studies of DNA adducts. Studies of workers in the reinforced plastics industry were considered more informative because of higher worker exposure and less confounding by other carcinogens. RESULTS: We found no consistent increased risk of any cancer among workers exposed to styrene. A study of reinforced plastic workers reported an association between average estimated styrene exposure and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL, P = 0.05) but no trend with increasing duration of exposure. Other studies of styrene exposure and NHL found no increased risk. In two US studies of reinforced plastic workers, esophageal cancer mortality was increased, but these findings were generated in a background of multiple comparisons. Results for other cancers were unremarkable.

METHODS: Cause-specific standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated. RESULTS: The observed number of deaths was approximately equal to that expected for leukemia (10 observed/13 expected), Hodgkin lymphoma (1/1.6), multiple myeloma (7/7.9), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (15/14), and cancers of the breast (72/74) and ovary (21/22).

METHODS: We defined a cohort of 127,266 men with at least 1 day of employment during the period of 1979 through 2000. Computerized human resources databases were the basis of the cohort definition as well as the source of demographic and most work history information. Standardized mortality ratios (SMR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for 94 causes of death, including analyses by operating segment and job type. RESULTS: Most SMR results are below unity. The main exception is mesothelioma (SMR = 1.49; 95% CI = 1.15 to 1.90), which has elevations three times greater than expectation among some groups of men working in manufacturing sites who were hired before 1960. SMRs for cancers of the blood and blood-forming organs are generally close to unity, whereas men in the chemicals segment have 17 deaths due to acute non-lymphocytic leukemia (SMR = 1.81; 95% CI = 1.06 to 2.90), with no temporal or job type patterns. Men in the downstream segment have an elevation of aplastic anemia (SMR = 2.19; 95% CI = 0.95 to 4.32), based on eight deaths. There are eight deaths from malignant melanoma among downstream drivers (SMR = 2.46; 95% CI = 1.06 to 4.84), and motor vehicle accident rates are slightly elevated among some groups of younger and shorter-term operators.

Arterioles control the flow of blood into bone marrow compartments, and sinusoids serve as a conduit to the bloodstream and as niches for megakaryocyte development. Most studies of bone marrow vasculature, including studies quantifying changes in the marrow vascular by microvascular density, do not differentiate between different types of marrow vessels. Recognizing changes in different types of blood vessels after chemotherapy exposure or during leukemia development has important physiological implications. We hypothesized that the functional heterogeneity of marrow vasculature could be recognized through the use of functional markers such as tyrosine kinase with immunoglobulin and epidermal growth factor homology domains-2 (Tie2) expression or 1,1-dioctadecyl -3,3,3,3-tetramethyl-indocarbocyanine perchlorate with acetylated low-density lipoprotein (DiI-Ac-LDL) uptake. METHODS AND RESULTS: When transgenic mice with green fluorescent protein (GFP) expressed downstream of the Tie2 promoter were injected with Ac-LDL, Ac-LDL was specifically endocytosed by sinusoids, and Tie2 expression was more pronounced in the arteries, arterioles, and transitional capillaries. Combining these 2 functional endothelial markers and using confocal microscopy to obtain 3-dimensional images, we identified transitional zones where arterioles emptied into the sinusoids. Alternatively, coinjection of lectin with DiI-Ac-LDL has a similar result in normal mice, as seen in Tie2/GFP mice, and can be used to differentiate vessel types in nontransgenic mice. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that bone marrow vasculature is functionally heterogeneous. Methods to study changes in the marrow vasculature using microvascular density or quantifying changes in the vascular niche need to take this heterogeneity into account.","['Li, Xiao-Miao', 'Hu, Zhongbo', 'Jorgenson, Marda L', 'Slayton, William B']","['Li XM', 'Hu Z', 'Jorgenson ML', 'Slayton WB']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091026,United States,Circulation,Circulation,0147763,PMC2795403,2009/10/28 06:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/10/28 06:00'],"['2009/10/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['CIRCULATIONAHA.109.871574 [pii]', '10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.109.871574 [doi]']",ppublish,Circulation. 2009 Nov 10;120(19):1910-8. doi: 10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.109.871574.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Clinically annotated microarray data from 425 patients with newly diagnosed de novo AML from two publicly available data sets were analyzed after age-specific cohorts (young <or= 45 years, n = 175; elderly >or= 55 years; n = 144) were prospectively identified. Gene expression analysis was conducted utilizing gene set enrichment analysis, and by applying previously defined and tested signature profiles reflecting dysregulation of oncogenic signaling pathways, altered tumor environment, and signatures of chemotherapy sensitivity. RESULTS: Elderly AML patients as expected had worse overall survival and event-free survival compared with younger patients. Analysis of oncogenic pathways revealed that older patients had higher probability of RAS, Src, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) pathway activation (all P < .0001). Older patients were also less sensitive to anthracycline compared with younger patients with AML (P < .0001). Hierarchical clustering revealed that younger AML patients in cluster 2 had clinically worse survival, with high RAS, Src, and TNF pathway activation and in turn were less sensitive to anthracycline compared with patients in cluster 1. However, among elderly patients with AML, those in cluster 1 also demonstrated high RAS, Src, and TNF pathway activation but this did not translate into differences in survival or anthracycline sensitivity. CONCLUSION: AML in the elderly represents a distinct biologic entity characterized by unique patterns of deregulated signaling pathway variations that contributes to poor survival and anthracycline resistance. These insights should enable development and adjustments of clinically meaningful treatment strategies in the older patient population.","['Rao, Arati V', 'Valk, Peter J M', 'Metzeler, Klaus H', 'Acharya, Chaitanya R', 'Tuchman, Sascha A', 'Stevenson, Marvaretta M', 'Rizzieri, David A', 'Delwel, Ruud', 'Buske, Christian', 'Bohlander, Stefan K', 'Potti, Anil', 'Lowenberg, Bob']","['Rao AV', 'Valk PJ', 'Metzeler KH', 'Acharya CR', 'Tuchman SA', 'Stevenson MM', 'Rizzieri DA', 'Delwel R', 'Buske C', 'Bohlander SK', 'Potti A', 'Lowenberg B']","['Division of Medical Oncology, Department of Medicine, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC 27708, USA. rao00012@mc.duke.edu']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091026,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,2009/10/28 06:00,2010/01/06 06:00,['2009/10/28 06:00'],"['2009/10/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/06 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2009.22.2547 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2009.22.2547 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2009 Nov 20;27(33):5580-6. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2009.22.2547.

The pathogenesis of infection in these patients is multifactorial, including inherent immune defects related to the primary disease process, such as hypogammaglobulinemia, as well as therapy-related immunosuppression. A characteristic spectrum of infectious complications has been described for specific treatment agents. With chlorambucil, most infections are bacterial in origin, caused by common Gram-positive and -negative organisms. Recurrent infections are a hallmark, with the respiratory tract being the most common site of infection. The pathogenesis of infection with the purine analogues is related to the quantitative and qualitative T-cell abnormalities induced by these agents. Risk factors for infection identified in patients treated with fludarabine include advanced-stage disease, prior CLL therapy, response to therapy, elevated serum creatinine, hemoglobin < 12 g/dL, and decreased serum IgG. As compared with patients receiving chlorambucil, patients receiving fludarabine have more major infections and herpes virus infections. However, Pneumocystis, Aspergillus, and cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections are uncommon. The use of alemtuzumab is complicated by frequent opportunistic infections. CMV reactivation is especially problematic, occurring in 10%-25% of patients. For prevention of infection, the use of vaccinations and immunoglobulin replacement has been studied. Recommendations for prophylactic antimicrobial therapy have arisen from CLL treatment trials and anecdotal reports. As new treatment approaches are developed for CLL, one must consider not only the efficacy of these agents for disease response but also the effect on subsequent infectious complications. Infectious complications remain a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with CLL. We will review the pathogenesis as well as the spectrum of infections in these patients. We will also discuss approaches to the prophylactic and therapeutic management of infections in these patients.","['Morrison, Vicki A']",['Morrison VA'],"['Section of Hematology/Oncology, Veterans Affairs Medical Center, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55417, USA. morri002@umn.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Clin Lymphoma Myeloma,Clinical lymphoma & myeloma,101256500,,2009/10/28 06:00,2010/02/13 06:00,['2009/10/28 06:00'],"['2009/10/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/13 06:00 [medline]']","['S1557-9190(11)70019-1 [pii]', '10.3816/CLM.2009.n.071 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Lymphoma Myeloma. 2009 Oct;9(5):365-70. doi: 10.3816/CLM.2009.n.071.,5,IM,"['Humans', 'Infection Control', 'Infections/*complications', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/*microbiology/pathology']",43,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVE: To know the prevalence of NEC and the mortality associated with it in adults with hematologic conditions and neutropenia <1000/mm3. MATERIAL AND METHODS: All adult patients who were hospitalized for malignant hematologic conditions with neutropenia <1000/mm3 were enrolled in the study; those with neutropenia >1000/mm3 were excluded. The diagnosis of NEC was based on the clinical data and imaging tests (abdominal plain X-rays and CT scan). Demographics of all patients were collected, as well as the data related with the course and treatment of the underlying hematologic condition and the NEC. RESULTS: 117 patients were enrolled in the study; 75.2% of them with some type of acute leukemia. The diagnosis of NEC was made in 8 patients (6.8%). NEC occurred in 10.5% of the patients with acute myeloid leukemia and in 8.0% of those with acute lymphocytic leukemia. Three patients died, which resulted in a 37.5% mortality rate.

However, this binding has not yet been experimentally proven. To confirm such binding, we synthesized biotin-labeled fostriecin (bio-Fos), which has an inhibitory activity against the proliferation of mouse leukemia cells. We showed that fostriecin directly binds to PP2Ac in HeLa S3 cells by pull-down assays using bio-Fos. Moreover, we directly demonstrated that fostriecin covalently binds to the Cys269 residue of PP2Ac by matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry analysis.

METHODS: Among the 46 evaluated patients 20 with lymphoma received BEAM as the conditioning regimen; 16 has relapsed germ cell tumors treated with CARBOPEC; and 10 with acute myeloid leukemia received BuCY. Increasing severity of nausea was evaluated according to the following 4-grade scale: none (no nausea); mild (slight nausea but no disruption to daily activities); moderate (nausea and some disruption to daily activities); and severe (extreme nausea and severe disruption to daily activities). The emetic response rate was evaluated using the criteria: complete (no emetic episode); major (1-2 episodes); minor (3-5 episodes); and failure (>5 episodes). The response rate of the study drugs was evaluated by the following 4-grade scale based on the condition of nausea and vomiting: highly effective, moderately effective, slightly effective, and not effective. RESULTS: Patients treated with palonosetron showed significantly greater response rates than those receiving ondansetron during the both the acute and the delayed phases: highly and moderately effective: acute phase 15% versus 5% CARBOPEC; 70% versus 35% BEAM and 32% versus 20% BuCY; delayed phase: 60% versus 30% BuCY; 100% versus 50% BEAM and 25% versus 10% CARBOPEC.

The mainstay of relapse treatment is donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI), but the efficacy of DLI is quite variable depending on disease histology and state. As such, there is a significant need for novel therapies and strategies for relapse following allogeneic HCT, particularly in patients for whom DLI is not an option.

However, the molecular mechanisms of emodin-mediated tumor regression have not been fully defined. Our preliminary study showed that emodin had highly cytotoxic effect on human chronic myeloid leukemia K562 cell lines. This study was performed to investigate the anti-tumor effect of emodin in human K562 cell line in vitro and in vivo. The MTT data showed the inhibition on growth of K562 cells following emodin treatment. Flow cytometry showed that the cell cycle of K562 cells was arrested in G(0)/G(1) phase. Through Western blot analysis, we found that the apoptosis-related protein Bcl-2 was decreased in a dose-dependent manner and the Bax was increased after emodin treatment. Moreover, activations of caspase-3, -8 and -9 were demonstrated in vitro and in vivo. The increased Bax concurrent with the decreased of Bcl-2 indicated that emodin treatment might result in apoptosis of K562 cells. The cell apoptosis was also directly demonstrated by Annexin V-FITC, and DNA fragmentation assay. Additionally, the tumoricidal effect of emodin was measured using a xenograft nude mice model. We found that, after inoculated with the K562 cells, the nude mice treated with emodin showed a significant decrease of tumor volume and tumor weight in comparison to the control. Emodin could cause the regression of tumor. Both in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that emodin can be developed as a promising anti-chronic myeloid leukemia drug.","['Chun-Guang, Wang', 'Jun-Qing, Yang', 'Bei-Zhong, Liu', 'Dan-Ting, Jin', 'Chong, Wang', 'Liang, Zhong', 'Dan, Zhu', 'Yan, Wu']","['Chun-Guang W', 'Jun-Qing Y', 'Bei-Zhong L', 'Dan-Ting J', 'Chong W', 'Liang Z', 'Dan Z', 'Yan W']","['Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medical Diagnostics, Ministry of Education, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400016, PR China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091024,Netherlands,Eur J Pharmacol,European journal of pharmacology,1254354,,2009/10/28 06:00,2010/04/07 06:00,['2009/10/28 06:00'],"['2009/04/29 00:00 [received]', '2009/09/23 00:00 [revised]', '2009/10/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/10/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/07 06:00 [medline]']","['S0014-2999(09)00942-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.ejphar.2009.10.035 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Pharmacol. 2010 Feb 10;627(1-3):33-41. doi: 10.1016/j.ejphar.2009.10.035.

It is a consensus classification in which a number of experts have agreed on the classification and diagnostic criteria. In general, the classification stratifies neoplasms according to their lineage (myeloid, lymphoid, histiocytic/dendritic) and distinguishes neoplasms of precursor cells from those comprised of functionally mature cells. Lymphoid neoplasms are derived from cells that frequently have features that recapitulate stages of normal B-, T-, and NK-cell differentiation and function, so to some extent they can be classified according to the corresponding normal counterpart, although additional features, such as genotype, clinical features and even location of the tumor figure into the final classification listing as well. Five major subgroups of myeloid neoplasms are recognized based mainly on their degree of maturation and biologic properties: myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) which are comprised primarily of mature cells with effective proliferation; myeloid (and lymphoid) neoplasms with eosinophilia and abnormalities of PDGFRA, PDGFRB and FGFR1, defined largely by the finding of significant eosinophilia and specific genetic abnormalities; myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms (MDS/MPN), comprised mainly of mature cells with both effective and ineffective proliferation of various lineages; myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), in which immature and mature cells are found with abnormal, dysplastic and ineffective maturation, and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), comprised of precursor cells with impaired maturation. Genetic abnormalities play an important role as diagnostic criteria for further sub-classification of some myeloid neoplasms, particularly of AML. Although therapy-related MDS and AML (t-MDS/AML) often have genetic defects identical to those found in de novo AML and de novo MDS, they are classified separately from de novo AML and MDS in order to emphasize their unique clinical and biologic properties.","['Vardiman, James W']",['Vardiman JW'],"['University of Chicago Medical Center, 5841 South Maryland Avenue, MC0008, Chicago, IL 60637, United States.

Bendamustine is a new agent that was recently added to the available regimens for the treatment of CLL. It was also recently approved for the treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Its mechanism of action is unknown, but it contains an alkylating group similar to that of other bifunctional alkylating agents such as chlorambucil, and it also contains a benzimidazole central ring thought to exhibit antipurine-like properties. The United States Food and Drug Administration approved bendamustine based on results from an international phase III study of CLL in which bendamustine was compared with chlorambucil in treatment-naive patients. Ongoing clinical trials are assessing the utility of bendamustine in combination with other agents for the treatment of CLL, as well as for other malignancies.","['Glode, Ashley E', 'Jarkowski, Anthony']","['Glode AE', 'Jarkowski A']","['Department of Pharmacy, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC 29412, USA. glode@musc.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Pharmacotherapy,Pharmacotherapy,8111305,,2009/10/28 06:00,2010/04/17 06:00,['2009/10/28 06:00'],"['2009/10/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/17 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1592/phco.29.11.1375 [doi]', '10.1592/phco.29.11.1375 [pii]']",ppublish,Pharmacotherapy. 2009 Nov;29(11):1375-84. doi: 10.1592/phco.29.11.1375.,11,IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/chemistry/*therapeutic use', 'Bendamustine Hydrochloride', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Molecular Structure', 'Nitrogen Mustard Compounds/adverse effects/chemistry/*therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome']",64,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Nitrogen Mustard Compounds)', '981Y8SX18M (Bendamustine Hydrochloride)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Indeed, this phenomenon led to the tentative assignment of RH to the short arm of chromosome 1. PCR-based analyses were performed on DNA from an 82-year-old D+ Caucasian patient with chronic myeloid leukemia after her RBCs became D-. For nearly 7 years, the patient's RBCs typed as strongly D+, but in March 2006, they typed weakly D+ and in August 2006 typed D- by both direct hemagglutination and the IAT. The D- typing persisted until the patient's death in September 2006. To study the underlying cause of the change in D type, PCR-based assays were performed on DNA extracted from peripheral WBCs from the patient's sample collected in August 2006. No amplification was obtained using primers designed to amplify RHD exons 5, 8, or 10, and intron 4. Very weak amplification was obtained using primers designed to amplify RHD exons 3, 4, or 7. Two assays that detect the hybrid Rhesus box showed deletion of RHD. Amplification of RHCE in the patient's DNA was as efficient as that of control samples, and multiplex and PCR-RFLP assays predicted her RBCs would be C-E-c+e+. Based on finding a hybrid Rhesus box and absence of D-specific exons, we conclude that DNA from the patient's WBCs carries a deleted RHD.

Several studies have reported an association between malignant melanoma and breast cancer, bladder cancer, colorectal cancer, neuroectodermal tumours, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, leukaemia and renal cell carcinoma. We report a case series of patients with a diagnosis of malignant melanoma who also developed a renal mass. In two of these cases, the renal mass became apparent on diagnostic imaging as part of the staging investigations at the time of initial diagnosis of the malignant melanoma. In both of these cases, biopsy of the renal mass confirmed the presence of a separate primary renal cell carcinoma which had presented concurrently with the malignant melanoma. A third case presented with bone metastases ten years after excision of a thin melanoma. Further imaging revealed pulmonary metastases and a renal mass, biopsy of which confirmed renal cell carcinoma. In contrast, a fourth patient underwent a right nephrectomy for a renal mass having presented with abdominal discomfort. The histology of this lesion was in keeping with metastatic melanoma, and the patient's past history included a diagnosis of ocular melanoma eight years prior to the development of metastatic disease in the right kidney. Survival rates for patients with many types of malignant disease are improving, and there have been significant advances in clinical imaging techniques. Consequently the development and detection of a second primary cancer, either presenting concurrently or on subsequent follow-up, is likely to be increasingly observed.

PROCEDURE: We performed a retrospective analysis in patients with PTCL over an 18-year period (1991-2008). RESULTS: We could analyze clinical data in 21 patients with non-anaplastic PTCL; 10 were female and 10 male. Median age of onset was 11 years (range: 1-21 years). There were nine patients with PTCL, not otherwise specified (PTCL-NOS); ten with extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type; one with angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma; and one with subcutaneous panniculitis-like T-cell lymphoma. Initial lesions involved cervical lymph nodes in five patients, and the skin in five patients. In five patients, hemophagocytic syndrome (HPS) was the initial clinical feature. There were 12 patients with advanced stage disease (stages III and IV). Chemotherapy and radiation was administered in 18 and 2 patients, respectively. Among the two patients who did not receive chemotherapy and radiation, one patient died while being treated for HPS but another improved spontaneously. Although 5 patients relapsed, 18 of 21 patients remained alive without disease at last follow-up. Five-year overall survival rate was 85.2%. CONCLUSIONS: Generally, the outcome results of conventional chemotherapy for high-risk PTCL are poor in adult patients. However, the excellent results in our study suggest that PTCL of childhood is quite different from that of adulthood. Although this study is first report about PTCL of Asian children, the number of patients was small in this study. Larger studies are needed to confirm these findings.","['Kobayashi, Ryoji', 'Yamato, Kazumi', 'Tanaka, Fumiko', 'Takashima, Yoshifumi', 'Inada, Hiroko', 'Kikuchi, Akira', 'Kumagai, Masa-Aki', 'Sunami, Shosuke', 'Nakagawa, Atsuko', 'Fukano, Reiji', 'Fujita, Naoto', 'Mitsui, Tetsuo', 'Tsurusawa, Masahito', 'Mori, Tetsuya']","['Kobayashi R', 'Yamato K', 'Tanaka F', 'Takashima Y', 'Inada H', 'Kikuchi A', 'Kumagai MA', 'Sunami S', 'Nakagawa A', 'Fukano R', 'Fujita N', 'Mitsui T', 'Tsurusawa M', 'Mori T']","['Department of Pediatrics, Sapporo Hokuyu Hospital, Shiroishiku, Sapporo, Japan. r-koba@jacls.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,2009/10/27 06:00,2010/01/27 06:00,['2009/10/27 06:00'],"['2009/10/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.22329 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2010 Feb;54(2):212-5. doi: 10.1002/pbc.22329.,2,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Japan/epidemiology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell, Peripheral/*epidemiology/mortality/pathology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Survival Rate', 'Young Adult']",,,"['(c) 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,"['Lymphoma Committee, Japanese Pediatric Leukemia/Lymphoma Study Group']",,,,

High toxicity and low selectivity reduces the application of this drug. Though, there is a necessity to find new compounds characterized by similar therapeutic effects but a higher selectivity and safety. As a result, the proline analogue of nitrosourea, N-[N'-(2-bromophenyl)-N'-nitrosocarbamoyl]proline (AC), has been synthesized. The aim of this study was to compare the influence of carmustine and the proline analogue of nitrosourea on the antioxidant abilities of fibroblasts and leukemia cells, MOLT4. It was shown that carmustine as well as AC cause an increase in hydrogen peroxide concentration in normal and neoplastic cells. Incubation with both compounds led to a diminution of the activity of antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and reductase. Changes in activity / level of antioxidant parameters were accompanied by augmentation of lipid and oxidative protein modifications. In conclusion, carmustine and AC cause changes in the antioxidative system of normal and MOLT4 cells and are a reason of oxidative stress formation.","['Stankiewicz-Kranc, Anna', 'Bielawska, Anna', 'Bielawski, Krzysztof', 'Skrzydlewska, Elzbieta']","['Stankiewicz-Kranc A', 'Bielawska A', 'Bielawski K', 'Skrzydlewska E']","['Department of Analytical Chemistry, Medical University of Bialystok, Kilinskiego 1, 15-089 Bialystok, Poland. astankie@umwb.edu.pl']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Germany,Arch Pharm (Weinheim),Archiv der Pharmazie,0330167,,2009/10/27 06:00,2010/01/08 06:00,['2009/10/27 06:00'],"['2009/10/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ardp.200900120 [doi]'],ppublish,Arch Pharm (Weinheim). 2009 Nov;342(11):632-9. doi: 10.1002/ardp.200900120.,11,IM,"['Antioxidants', 'Carmustine/administration & dosage', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytotoxins/*chemistry', 'Fibroblasts/cytology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/pathology', 'Nitrosourea Compounds/*chemistry', 'Oxidative Stress/drug effects', 'Prodrugs/chemistry', '*Proline']",,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Cytotoxins)', '0 (Nitrosourea Compounds)', '0 (Prodrugs)', '9DLQ4CIU6V (Proline)', 'U68WG3173Y (Carmustine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Additionally, as most key transcription factors regulating early hematopoietic development have also been implicated in various types of leukemia, understanding their function during normal development could result in a better comprehension of their roles during abnormal hematopoiesis in leukemia.

Only limited information on long-term outcome is currently available. We performed a long-term follow-up analysis of 42 patients with low or intermediate risk myelodysplastic syndromes and 5q deletion treated with lenalidomide. At a median follow-up of 40 months, 58% of the patients achieved an erythroid response and 48% a cytogenetic response. Thirty-six percent of patients progressed into acute myeloid leukaemia. Most of them (87%) acquired chromosome aberrations in addition to the 5q deletion, i.e. underwent clonal evolution during leukaemogenesis. There were no clinical, cytological or cytogenetic markers at study entry that allowed prediction of increased risk of leukaemic transformation. However, erythroid and cytogenetic responders had a significantly decreased risk of progression to acute myeloid leukaemia (p = 0.001 and p = 0.009, respectively) compared to non-responders. Three and 5 years after study entry, the cumulative incidence of acute myeloid leukaemia for patients with a cytogenetic response was 10% and 21%, respectively, and for patients without cytogenetic response, it was 46% and 60%. Patients with del(5q) myelodysplastic syndromes without erythroid or cytogenetic remission after treatment with lenalidomide have a high risk for clonal evolution and acute myeloid leukaemia progression. In refractory, or relapsing, patients, genetic instability and clonal evolution seem to be the driving forces of leukaemic transformation. Regular follow-up investigations of del(5q) myelodysplastic syndrome patients treated with lenalidomide may help to identify patients requiring alternative treatment strategies.","['Gohring, Gudrun', 'Giagounidis, Aristoteles', 'Busche, Guntram', 'Kreipe, Hans Heinrich', 'Zimmermann, Martin', 'Hellstrom-Lindberg, Eva', 'Aul, Carlo', 'Schlegelberger, Brigitte']","['Gohring G', 'Giagounidis A', 'Busche G', 'Kreipe HH', 'Zimmermann M', 'Hellstrom-Lindberg E', 'Aul C', 'Schlegelberger B']","['Institute of Cell and Molecular Pathology, Hannover Medical School, Carl-Neuberg-Str. 1, 30625, Hannover, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091024,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,,2009/10/27 06:00,2010/03/10 06:00,['2009/10/27 06:00'],"['2009/09/24 00:00 [received]', '2009/09/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/10/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00277-009-0846-z [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2010 Apr;89(4):365-74. doi: 10.1007/s00277-009-0846-z.

In addition, understanding the varied biological processes that are operative in disease relapse has encouraged the development of novel therapies, and could be beneficial to patients who are currently managed conservatively with supportive care for relapsed disease. Incorporating novel combinations of drugs with immunomodulation, although theoretically attractive, should be tested in the setting of clinical trials.

In this study, we retrospectively analyzed the results of autoHSCT according to the status of minimal residual disease (MRD) at transplantation, as a joint analysis of the European Study Group for Adult ALL (EWALL). Data on 123 recipients of autoHSCT, aged 31 (16-59) years, with B-lineage (n=77) or T-lineage (n=46) ALL were included. In a cohort of Ph-negative ALL, the probability of leukemia-free survival at 5 years was higher for patients with MRD <0.1% compared with those with MRD > or = 0.1% (57 vs 17%, P=0.0002). The difference was significant for T-lineage ALL (62 vs 8%, P=0.001), and a tendency was observed for B-lineage ALL (54 vs 26%, P=0.17). In a multivariate analysis, adjusted for other potential prognostic factors, high MRD level remained the only independent factor associated with increased risk of failure (risk ratio, 2.8; P=0.0005). We conclude that MRD determines the outcome of autoHSCT in HR adult ALL.

Outcomes are improved when invasive aspergillus is diagnosed early, prompting the initiation of appropriate antifungal therapy. We evaluated the utility of prospective monitoring for invasive aspergillosis (IA) using biomarkers such as serum galactomannan (GM) and/or blood polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in high-risk pediatric patients. METHODS: Patients with high-risk leukemia (HRL) or allogenic hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients were prospectively monitored twice weekly for IA using GM and PCR for Aspergillus species. RESULTS: Sixty-eight patients had collected >or=2 specimens. The 1086 specimens were collected; 627 from HRL (58%) and 459 (42%) from HCT recipients. Median specimens/patient was 11.0 (2 to 58), and median follow-up/patient was 98.5 days (14 to 437). Fifty-six percent of samples were obtained from patients receiving mold-active agents; 32% HRL and 89% HCT. There were no proven, 3 probable, and 20 possible episodes of IA. Thirteen specimens (1.2%) from 4 patients (5%) were GM+. None were positive by PCR. CONCLUSIONS: The prospective use of GM and PCR in this high-risk pediatric population did not identify cases of proven IA. A high false positive rate was not detected. It is speculated that changes in clinical practice, such as early use of empiric and/or prophylactic mold-active agent and frequent imaging studies have impacted the epidemiology of IA. In a population with low incidence of IA, the use of these assays as a screening device on blood may not further enhance current outcomes.","['Armenian, Saro H', 'Nash, Kevin A', 'Kapoor, Neena', 'Franklin, Janet L', 'Gaynon, Paul S', 'Ross, Lawrence A', 'Hoffman, Jill A']","['Armenian SH', 'Nash KA', 'Kapoor N', 'Franklin JL', 'Gaynon PS', 'Ross LA', 'Hoffman JA']","['Department of Population Sciences, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, CA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,,2009/10/27 06:00,2010/01/08 06:00,['2009/10/27 06:00'],"['2009/10/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/MPH.0b013e3181b83e77 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2009 Dec;31(12):920-6. doi: 10.1097/MPH.0b013e3181b83e77.,12,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aspergillosis/*diagnosis/microbiology/therapy', 'Aspergillus/genetics/*isolation & purification', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA, Fungal/genetics', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Female', 'Galactose/analogs & derivatives', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*diagnosis/microbiology/therapy', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Mannans/*blood', '*Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Prospective Studies', 'RNA, Ribosomal, 28S/analysis', 'Risk Factors', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Young Adult']",,"['0 (DNA, Fungal)', '0 (Mannans)', '0 (RNA, Ribosomal, 28S)', '11078-30-1 (galactomannan)', 'X2RN3Q8DNE (Galactose)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Molecular karyotyping and quantitative analysis of BCR-ABL transcript demonstrated that approximately one-third of CD34(-) cells are leukemic. CML Lin(-)CD34(-) cells showed kinetic quiescence and limited clonogenic capacity. However, stroma-dependent cultures induced CD34 expression on some cells and cell cycling, and increased clonogenic activity and expression of BCR-ABL transcript. Lin(-)CD34(-) cells showed hematopoietic cell engraftment rate in 2 immunodeficient mouse strains similar to Lin-CD34(+) cells, whereas endothelial cell engraftment was significantly higher. Gene expression profiling revealed the down-regulation of cell-cycle arrest genes and genes involved in antigen presentation and processing, while the expression of genes related to tumor progression, such as angiogenic factors, was strongly up-regulated compared with normal counterparts. Phenotypic analysis confirmed the significant down-regulation of HLA class I and II molecules in CML Lin(-)CD34(-) cells. Imatinib mesylate did not reduce fusion transcript levels, BCR-ABL kinase activity, and clonogenic efficiency of CML Lin(-)CD34(-) cells in vitro. Moreover, leukemic CD34(-) cells survived exposure to BCR-ABL inhibitors in vivo.

Using a combination of chromatin immunoprecipitation promotor arrays (ChIP-chip) and gene expression profiling, we identify novel, direct target genes of PLZF-RARalpha that tend to be repressed in APL compared with other myeloid leukemias, supporting the role of PLZF-RARalpha as an aberrant repressor in APL. In primary murine hematopoietic progenitors, PLZF-RARalpha promotes cell growth, and represses Dusp6 and Cdkn2d, while inducing c-Myc expression, consistent with its role in leukemogenesis. PLZF-RARalpha binds to a region of the c-MYC promoter overlapping a functional PLZF site and antagonizes PLZF-mediated repression, suggesting that PLZF-RARalpha may act as a dominant-negative version of PLZF by affecting the regulation of shared targets. RA induced the differentiation of PLZF-RARalpha-transformed murine hematopoietic cells and reduced the frequency of clonogenic progenitors, concomitant with c-Myc down-regulation.

Here we hypothesized that this characteristic gene expression signature may have been established by potentially reversible epigenetic modifications. To test this hypothesis, we used differential methylation hybridization to explore the DNA methylation patterns underlying MLL-rearranged ALL in infants. The obtained results were correlated with gene expression data to confirm gene silencing as a result of promoter hypermethylation. Distinct promoter CpG island methylation patterns separated different genetic subtypes of MLL-rearranged ALL in infants. MLL translocations t(4;11) and t(11;19) characterized extensively hypermethylated leukemias, whereas t(9;11)-positive infant ALL and infant ALL carrying wild-type MLL genes epigenetically resembled normal bone marrow. Furthermore, the degree of promoter hypermethylation among infant ALL patients carrying t(4;11) or t(11;19) appeared to influence relapse-free survival, with patients displaying accentuated methylation being at high relapse risk. Finally, we show that the demethylating agent zebularine reverses aberrant DNA methylation and effectively induces apoptosis in MLL-rearranged ALL cells. Collectively these data suggest that aberrant DNA methylation occurs in the majority of MLL-rearranged infant ALL cases and guides clinical outcome. Therefore, inhibition of aberrant DNA methylation may be an important novel therapeutic strategy for MLL-rearranged ALL in infants.","['Stumpel, Dominique J P M', 'Schneider, Pauline', 'van Roon, Eddy H J', 'Boer, Judith M', 'de Lorenzo, Paola', 'Valsecchi, Maria G', 'de Menezes, Renee X', 'Pieters, Rob', 'Stam, Ronald W']","['Stumpel DJ', 'Schneider P', 'van Roon EH', 'Boer JM', 'de Lorenzo P', 'Valsecchi MG', 'de Menezes RX', 'Pieters R', 'Stam RW']","[""Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Erasmus Medical Center-Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091023,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,2009/10/27 06:00,2010/02/10 06:00,['2009/10/27 06:00'],"['2009/10/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/10 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)38769-3 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2009-06-227660 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2009 Dec 24;114(27):5490-8. doi: 10.1182/blood-2009-06-227660.

In murine leukemia virus, accessibility of the 5' splice site (ss) is regulated by an upstream region, which can fold into a complex RNA stem-loop structure. The underlying sequence of the structure itself is negligible, since most of it could be functionally replaced by a simple heterologous RNA stem-loop preserving the wild-type splicing pattern. Increasing the RNA duplex formation between U1 snRNA and the 5'ss by a compensatory mutation in position +6 led to enhanced splicing. Interestingly, this mutation affects splicing only in the context of the secondary structure, arguing for a dynamic interplay between structure and primary 5'ss sequence. The reduced 5'ss accessibility could also be counteracted by recruiting a splicing enhancer domain via a modified MS2 phage coat protein to a single binding site at the tip of the simple RNA stem-loop. The mechanism of 5'ss attenuation was revealed using hyperstable U1 snRNA mutants, showing that restricted U1 snRNP access is the cause of retroviral alternative splicing.","['Zychlinski, Daniela', 'Erkelenz, Steffen', 'Melhorn, Vanessa', 'Baum, Christopher', 'Schaal, Heiner', 'Bohne, Jens']","['Zychlinski D', 'Erkelenz S', 'Melhorn V', 'Baum C', 'Schaal H', 'Bohne J']","['Institute for Virology, Hannover Medical School, 30625 Hannover, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Nucleic Acids Res,Nucleic acids research,0411011,PMC2794156,2009/10/27 06:00,2010/02/13 06:00,['2009/10/27 06:00'],"['2009/10/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/13 06:00 [medline]']","['gkp694 [pii]', '10.1093/nar/gkp694 [doi]']",ppublish,Nucleic Acids Res. 2009 Dec;37(22):7429-40. doi: 10.1093/nar/gkp694.,22,IM,"['*Alternative Splicing', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics/physiology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nuclear Proteins/chemistry', 'Nucleic Acid Conformation', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Proviruses/genetics/physiology', '*RNA Splice Sites', 'RNA, Small Nuclear/*chemistry/metabolism', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/chemistry', 'Serine-Arginine Splicing Factors', 'Suppression, Genetic', 'Virus Replication']",,"['0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (RNA Splice Sites)', '0 (RNA, Small Nuclear)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (U1 small nuclear RNA)', '170974-22-8 (Serine-Arginine Splicing Factors)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Laboratory studies showed a white blood cell (WBC) count of 31.6x10(9)/L, which increased progressively to 50.0x10(9)/L over the next several days. Peripheral blood smear revealed 92% lymphoblast with uneven bulk. A biopsy through the right labiogingival groove disclosed a submucosal homogeneous mass. Histologic examination under the microscope revealed atypical mononuclear cells with obvious atypia and nuclear divisions. Bone marrow puncture showed atypical lymphocytes with active proliferation. Immune phenotypic analysis by flow cytometry showed that malignant cells were positive for CD19, CD34, HLA-DR, CD38, CD22, CD58, CD45 and CD56. Real time RT-PCR revealed positive BCR/ABL arrangement. High-risk ALL was diagnosed and four stages of chemotherapies were given for nearly three years. After the induction of the chemotherapy, the facial mass disappeared. A bone marrow biopsy revealed that CR had been achieved since a month after chemotherapy's onset. The initial presentation of ALL as a maxillofacial mass is exceedingly rare.

Immunological approaches to neutralizing these hormones have additional utility in cancer treatment. Vaccines have been developed against both GnRH and hCG and these have undergone Phase I/II clinical trials documenting their safety, reversibility and efficacy. The heterospecies dimer hCG vaccine prevented pregnancy in women of proven fertility without impairment of ovulation or derangement of menstrual regularity and bleeding profiles. The protective threshold of antibody titers to achieve efficacy was determined in these first-ever trials. Recently, a recombinant vaccine against the beta subunit of hCG linked to the B subunit of heat labile enterotoxin has been made and expressed as a glycosylated conjugate in Pichia pastoris. Experiments indicate its ability to generate antibodies above the protective threshold in all immunized Balb/c mice. Ectopic expression of hCG/hCGbeta is observed in many advanced stage cancers of various origins. A chimeric high affinity and specific recombinant antibody against hCGbeta linked to curcumin kills hCGbeta expressing T lymphoblastic leukemia cells without any deleterious effect. Several synthetic and recombinant vaccines have been developed against GnRH. These reduce serum testosterone to castration levels causing atrophy of the prostate. Three Phase I/II clinical trials conducted in India and Austria have shown that these vaccines elicit non-surgical reduction of testosterone, a fall in prostate specific antigen and clinical improvement of prostate carcinoma patients.

Here, we report a simplified method for measuring proliferation of malignant B cells in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). DESIGN AND METHODS: Patients were labelled with (2)H(2)O for 6 weeks; blood samples were obtained at 0, 3, and 6 weeks during (2)H(2)O labelling and 9, 12, and 16 weeks thereafter. Bone marrow was sampled at week 6. Phlebotomy was performed at multiple, non-research clinical sites. CLL cells were isolated in a central laboratory, using a novel RosetteSep-based method; DNA labelling was analyzed by GC/P/IRMS. RESULTS: In 26 of 29 patients, CLL cell isolation resulted in > or =95% purity for malignant CD5+ B cells; in one patient, malignant cells expressed marginal levels of CD5, and in two others, further sorting of CD5hi malignant cells was required. Cell yields correlated with white blood cell counts and exceeded GC/P/IRMS requirements ( approximately 10(7) cells) >98% of the time; high-quality DNA labelling data were obtained. RosetteSep isolation achieved adequate CLL cell purity from bone marrow in only 64% of samples, but greatly reduced subsequent sort time for impure samples. CONCLUSION: This method enables clinical studies of CLL cell proliferation outside of research settings, using a shorter (2)H(2)O intake protocol, a minimal sampling protocol, and centralised sample processing. The CLL cell isolation protocol may also prove useful in other applications.

Little is known about aberrant methylation in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), a heterogeneous clonal stem cell disorder with a approximately 30% risk of transformation into secondary AML. Recent evidence demonstrated that ID4, a negative regulator of transcription, may act as a tumor-suppressor gene. To clarify the role of ID4 in MDS, we employed methylation-specific PCR (MSP) to examine the methylation status of ID4 in 144 adult de novo MDS patients. We found that ID4 methylation was present in 35.4% (n=51) of these MDS patients and methylaiton was correlated significantly with World Health Organization (WHO) subtypes and International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) risk groups. Patients with advanced stages of WHO subtypes (45.8% vs. 21.3%, P=0.002) and higher risk IPSS subgroups (45.7% vs. 26.0%, P=0.014) exhibited a significantly higher frequency of ID4 methylation. The median survival of patients with ID4 methylation was shorter than patients without ID4 methylation (12.2 months vs. 26.9 months, P=0.005). Multivariate analysis indicated that ID4 methylation status was the independent factor that impacted leukemia-free survival (LFS). Disease in patients with ID4 methylation progressed more rapidly than those without ID4 methylation (P=0.047, HR=2.11).

In this study, the anti-proliferative activity of plant extracts from Origanum majorana (marjoram) was tested on human lymphoblastic leukemia cell line Jurkat. Cytotoxicity was examined using non-radioactive cytotoxicity assay and the IC(50) was calculated. At non-cytotoxic concentrations, the viability of cells decreased with increase of concentration of plant extract. The anti-proliferative effect was also found to be dose-dependent. Analysis via flow cytometry shows that marjoram extracts stimulated apoptosis. Induction of apoptosis was caused by an up-regulation of p53 protein levels and down-regulation of Bcl-2alpha.

Therapeutic drug monitoring targeting trough plasma levels of about 1000ng/mL may help to optimize the therapeutic effect. METHODS: We developed a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method with UV/Diode Array Detection (DAD) for trough imatinib concentration determination in human plasma. Imatinib trough levels were measured in plasma from 65 CML patients using our method and LC-MS/MS as the reference method. Results with these two methods were compared using Deming regression, chi-square test, and sign test. RESULTS: The calibration curve was prepared in blank human plasma. HPLC-UV/DAD calibration curves were linear from 80 to 4000ng/mL, and the limit of quantification was set at 80ng/mL. The between-day variation was 6.1% with greater than 96% recovery after direct plasma deproteinization and greater than 98% recovery from the column. No significant differences in imatinib plasma levels were found between HPLC-UV/DAD and LC-MS/MS. CONCLUSIONS: This HPLC-UV/DAD method was sufficiently specific and sensitive for imatinib TDM, with no evidence of interference. Our rapid inexpensive HPLC-UV/DAD method that requires only widely available equipment performs well for plasma imatinib assays.","['Roth, Olivia', 'Spreux-Varoquaux, Odile', 'Bouchet, Stephane', 'Rousselot, Philippe', 'Castaigne, Sylvie', 'Rigaudeau, Sophie', 'Raggueneau, Victoria', 'Therond, Patrice', 'Devillier, Philippe', 'Molimard, Mathieu', 'Maneglier, Benjamin']","['Roth O', 'Spreux-Varoquaux O', 'Bouchet S', 'Rousselot P', 'Castaigne S', 'Rigaudeau S', 'Raggueneau V', 'Therond P', 'Devillier P', 'Molimard M', 'Maneglier B']","['Centre Hospitalier de Versailles, Service de Pharmacie, Le Chesnay, France.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20091022,Netherlands,Clin Chim Acta,Clinica chimica acta; international journal of clinical chemistry,1302422,,2009/10/27 06:00,2010/03/26 06:00,['2009/10/27 06:00'],"['2009/05/18 00:00 [received]', '2009/10/06 00:00 [revised]', '2009/10/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/10/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/26 06:00 [medline]']","['S0009-8981(09)00534-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cca.2009.10.007 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Chim Acta. 2010 Feb;411(3-4):140-6. doi: 10.1016/j.cca.2009.10.007.

FLT3-ITD-expressing murine and human myeloid cell lines, HF6/FLT3-ITD and K562/FLT3-ITD cells, respectively, were developed in order to clarify whether FLT3-ITD is involved in the resistance to cytotoxic agents in AML. Both of these cell lines were specifically resistant to the pyrimidine analogue cytosine arabinoside (ara-C), an essential agent for AML, accompanied by the downregulation of equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 (ENT1), a transporter responsible for the cellular uptake of ara-C. The ENT1 promoter activity and the cellular uptake of ara-C were reduced in K562/FLT3-ITD cells, and rescued by pretreating the cells with PKC412, a FLT3 inhibitor. In addition, the expression of hypoxia inducible factor 1 alpha subunit (HIF1A) transcripts was upregulated in K562/FLT3-ITD cells, and the induction of HIF-1alpha reduced the promoter activity of ENT1 gene in K562 cells. Taken together, these findings suggest that FLT3-ITD specifically induces ara-C resistance in leukemic cells by the repression of ENT1 expression, possibly through the upregulation of HIF-1alpha, while also partially accounting for the poor prognosis of AML with FLT3-ITD due to resistance to the standard chemotherapy protocols which include ara-C.","['Jin, Guilan', 'Matsushita, Hiromichi', 'Asai, Satomi', 'Tsukamoto, Hideo', 'Ono, Ryoichi', 'Nosaka, Tetsuya', 'Yahata, Takashi', 'Takahashi, Shinichiro', 'Miyachi, Hayato']","['Jin G', 'Matsushita H', 'Asai S', 'Tsukamoto H', 'Ono R', 'Nosaka T', 'Yahata T', 'Takahashi S', 'Miyachi H']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Tokai University School of Medicine, 143 Shimokasuya, Isehara, Kanagawa 259-1193, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091022,United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,,2009/10/27 06:00,2009/12/30 06:00,['2009/10/27 06:00'],"['2009/10/16 00:00 [received]', '2009/10/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/10/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/30 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-291X(09)02085-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2009.10.094 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2009 Dec 18;390(3):1001-6. doi: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2009.10.094.

The current study evaluated the temporal and spatial localization of PRDM16 during early mouse development (embryonic days 8.5-14.5). PRDM16 was first detected on E9.5 in a limited number of tissues and by E14.5, was expressed in a broad range of developing tissues including those of the brain, lung, kidney, and gastrointestinal tract.

Within these studies, the criteria used to define iron overload have varied considerably. Given the lack of consensus regarding the definition of iron overload in the transplant setting, we sought to methodically examine iron status among transplant patients. We studied 78 consecutive patients at risk for transfusion-related iron overload (diagnoses included AML, ALL, MDS, and aplastic anemia) who received either autologous or allogeneic stem cell transplant. Multiple measures of iron status were collected prior to transplantation and examined for their association with survival. Using this data, three potentially prognostic iron measures were identified and incorporated into a rational and unified scoring system. The resulting Transplant Iron Score assigns a point for each of the following variables: (1) greater than 25 red cell units transfused prior to transplantation; (2) serum ferritin > 1000 ng/ml; and (3) a semi-quantitative bone marrow iron stain of 6+. In our cohort, the score (range 0 to 3) was more closely associated with survival than any available single iron parameter. In multivariate analysis, we observed an independent effect of iron overload on transplant survival (p = 0.01) primarily attributable to an increase in early treatment-related deaths (p = 0.02) and lethal infections. In subgroup analysis, the predictive power of the iron score was most pronounced among allogeneic transplant patients, where a high score (> or = 2) was associated with a 50% absolute decrease in survival at one year. In summary, our results lend further credence to the notion that iron overload prior to transplant is detrimental and suggest iron overload may predispose to a higher rate of lethal infections.","['Storey, Jonathan A', 'Connor, Rebecca F', 'Lewis, Zachary T', 'Hurd, David', 'Pomper, Gregory', 'Keung, Yi K', 'Grover, Manisha', 'Lovato, James', 'Torti, Suzy V', 'Torti, Frank M', 'Molnar, Istvan']","['Storey JA', 'Connor RF', 'Lewis ZT', 'Hurd D', 'Pomper G', 'Keung YK', 'Grover M', 'Lovato J', 'Torti SV', 'Torti FM', 'Molnar I']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Section on Hematology and Oncology, Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, NC, USA. jonstorey@live.com']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091024,England,J Hematol Oncol,Journal of hematology & oncology,101468937,PMC2770452,2009/10/27 06:00,2010/06/16 06:00,['2009/10/27 06:00'],"['2009/07/17 00:00 [received]', '2009/10/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/10/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/16 06:00 [medline]']","['1756-8722-2-44 [pii]', '10.1186/1756-8722-2-44 [doi]']",epublish,J Hematol Oncol. 2009 Oct 24;2:44. doi: 10.1186/1756-8722-2-44.,,IM,"['Adult', 'Anemia, Aplastic/blood/diagnosis/mortality/therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Iron/analysis/*blood', 'Iron Overload/etiology/*mortality', 'Leukemia/blood/*diagnosis/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/blood/diagnosis/mortality/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Research Design', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/*mortality', 'Survival Analysis']",,['E1UOL152H7 (Iron)'],,,"['R37 DK042412/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 DK42412/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we report a development of formulations capable of promoting targeted delivery and enhanced pharmacologic activity of ODNs in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines and patient primary cells. In this study, transferrin (Tf) conjugated pH-sensitive lipopolyplex nanoparticles (LPs) were prepared to deliver GTI-2040, an antisense ODN against the R2 subunit of ribonucleotide reductase that has been shown to contribute to chemoresistance in AML. LPs had an average particle size around 110 nm and a moderately positive zeta potential at approximately 10 mV. The ODN encapsulation efficiency of LPs was >90%. These nanoparticles could release ODNs at acidic endosomal pH and facilitate the cytoplasmic delivery of ODNs after endocytosis. In addition, Tf-mediated targeted delivery of GTI-2040 was achieved. R2 downregulation at both mRNA and protein levels was improved by 8-fold in Kasumi-1 cells and 2- to 20-fold in AML patient primary cells treated with GTI-2040-Tf-LPs, compared to free GTI-2040 treatment. Moreover, Tf-LPs were more effective than nontargeted LPs, with 10 to 100% improvement at various concentrations in Kasumi-1 cells and an average of 45% improvement at 3 microM concentration in AML patient primary cells. Treatment with 1 microM GTI-2040-Tf-LPs sensitized AML cells to the chemotherapy agent cytarabine, by decreasing its IC(50) value from 47.69 nM to 9.05 nM. This study suggests that the combination of pH sensitive LP formulation and Tf mediated targeting is a promising strategy for antisense ODN delivery in leukemia therapy.","['Jin, Yan', 'Liu, Shujun', 'Yu, Bo', 'Golan, Sharon', 'Koh, Chee-Guan', 'Yang, Jintao', 'Huynh, Lenguyen', 'Yang, Xiaojuan', 'Pang, Jiuxia', 'Muthusamy, Natarajan', 'Chan, Kenneth K', 'Byrd, John C', 'Talmon, Yeshayahu', 'Lee, L James', 'Lee, Robert J', 'Marcucci, Guido']","['Jin Y', 'Liu S', 'Yu B', 'Golan S', 'Koh CG', 'Yang J', 'Huynh L', 'Yang X', 'Pang J', 'Muthusamy N', 'Chan KK', 'Byrd JC', 'Talmon Y', 'Lee LJ', 'Lee RJ', 'Marcucci G']","['NSF Nanoscale Science and Engineering Center, Division of Pharmaceutics, College of Pharmacy, Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, The Comprehensive Cancer Center, and Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",,United States,Mol Pharm,Molecular pharmaceutics,101197791,PMC4342499,2009/10/27 06:00,2010/04/20 06:00,['2009/10/27 06:00'],"['2009/10/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/mp900205r [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Pharm. 2010 Feb 1;7(1):196-206. doi: 10.1021/mp900205r.,1,IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cryoelectron Microscopy', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Down-Regulation', '*Drug Delivery Systems', 'Genetic Therapy/methods', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/metabolism/*therapy', 'Nanoparticles/administration & dosage/chemistry/ultrastructure', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides/administration & dosage/genetics/therapeutic use', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides, Antisense/*administration & dosage/*genetics/therapeutic use', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Transferrin/metabolism', 'Ribonucleotide Reductases/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Transferrin/administration & dosage', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)', '0 (Transferrin)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '236391-66-5 (GTI2040)', 'EC 1.17.4.- (Ribonucleotide Reductases)', 'EC 1.17.4.- (ribonucleotide reductase R2 subunit)']",,,"['R01 CA135243/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA135332/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 RR025755/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA135243/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,['NIHMS157962'],,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: At the baseline of the Women's Health Initiative Observational Study (1994-1998), participants reported information about intentional weight loss episodes in the past 20 years. We estimated hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) among 81,219 women for associations between past intentional weight loss and risk of developing non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), leukemia, and multiple myeloma during an average 9.9 years of follow-up. RESULTS: The risk of NHL was associated with having lost a large maximum amount of weight (> or =50 pounds, HR = 1.68, 95% CI 1.13-2.50). NHL risk also varied by the frequency of intentional weight loss; women had increased risk if they lost 50 pounds or more > or =3 times (HR = 1.97, 95% CI 0.93-4.16; p trend by frequency = 0.09) or 20-49 pounds > or =3 times (HR = 1.55, 95% CI 1.00-2.40; p trend = 0.05), but there was no risk associated with smaller amounts of weight loss (10-19 pounds > or =3 times, HR = 0.78, 95% CI 0.46-1.33). These associations persisted with adjustment for body mass index at different ages. We observed non-significant associations of similar magnitude for multiple myeloma, but past intentional weight loss episodes were not associated with leukemia. CONCLUSION: Further assessment of intentional weight loss as a possible risk factor for lymphomas may provide insight into the etiology of these cancers.","['De Roos, Anneclaire J', 'Ulrich, Cornelia M', 'Ray, Roberta M', 'Mossavar-Rahmani, Yasmin', 'Rosenberg, Carol A', 'Caan, Bette J', 'Thomson, Cynthia A', 'McTiernan, Anne', 'LaCroix, Andrea Z']","['De Roos AJ', 'Ulrich CM', 'Ray RM', 'Mossavar-Rahmani Y', 'Rosenberg CA', 'Caan BJ', 'Thomson CA', 'McTiernan A', 'LaCroix AZ']","['Epidemiology Program, Division of Public Health Sciences, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA 98109-1024, USA. aderoos@fhcrc.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20091023,Netherlands,Cancer Causes Control,Cancer causes & control : CCC,9100846,,2009/10/24 06:00,2010/04/24 06:00,['2009/10/24 06:00'],"['2009/05/07 00:00 [received]', '2009/10/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/10/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10552-009-9453-5 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Causes Control. 2010 Feb;21(2):223-36. doi: 10.1007/s10552-009-9453-5.

To determine whether dose-intensive adjuvant regimens for breast cancer induce genetic damage to hematopoietic stem cells, defined by the emergence of clonal hematopoiesis, and whether detection of clonal hematopoiesis could be used as an early marker for the subsequent development of t-MN, the Southwest Oncology Group designed a pilot clonality investigation to estimate the incidence of clonal hematopoiesis during and shortly after completion of the dose intensive neoadjuvant regimens for high-risk breast cancer patients. Peripheral blood samples from 274 patients obtained prior to treatment, at time of surgery, and at 6 and 12 months post-surgery were examined by two different clonality assays: the HUMARA (HUMan Androgen Receptor) assay to estimate the incidence of early genetic damage by clonal proliferation, and microsatellite instability (MSI) testing to screen for LOH or defective DNA mismatch repair mechanisms. Clonal hematopoiesis was negative in 93.5% of the samples analyzed. Five patients showed a HUMARA-positive/MSI-negative pattern, and no patients showed a HUMARA-negative/MSI-positive pattern. With a median follow-up of 3.1 years, one patient in our study developed t-AML at 3 years 5 months after randomization. Our results indicate that clonal hematopoiesis assays performed within the 2 years following dose-intensive neoadjuvant therapy failed to identify an emerging clonal hematopoietic stem cell population. Longer clinical follow-up will be necessary to define better the positive predictive value of detecting clonal hematopoiesis in the HUMARA+/MSI- cases.","['Slovak, Marilyn L', 'Bedell, Victoria', 'Lew, Danika', 'Albain, Kathy S', 'Ellis, Georgiana K', 'Livingston, Robert B', 'Martino, Silvana', 'Perez, Edith A', 'Hortobagyi, Gabriel N', 'Sher, Dorie', 'Stock, Wendy']","['Slovak ML', 'Bedell V', 'Lew D', 'Albain KS', 'Ellis GK', 'Livingston RB', 'Martino S', 'Perez EA', 'Hortobagyi GN', 'Sher D', 'Stock W']","['Department of Cytogenetics, City of Hope, 1500 E.

Although PDCs account for less than 0.1% of peripheral blood mononuclear cells, they serve as a principal source of interferon-alpha and are also known as interferon-I producing cells (IPCs). Upon activation in vitro, they can differentiate into dendritic cells, and recent studies have substantiated a potential role in antigen presentation. Thus, PDCs may act as a link between innate and adaptive immunity. Normally found in small quantities in primary and secondary lymphoid organs, PDCs accumulate in a variety of inflammatory conditions, including Kikuchi-Fujimoto lymphadenopathy, hyaline-vascular Castleman disease, and autoimmune diseases, and in certain malignancies such as classical Hodgkin lymphoma and carcinomas. Demonstrating potential for neoplastic transformation reflective of varying stages of maturation, clonal proliferations range from PDC nodules most commonly associated with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia to the rare but highly aggressive malignancy now known as blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN). Formerly called blastic natural killer cell lymphoma or CD4/CD56 hematodermic neoplasm, BPDCN, unlike natural killer cell lymphomas, is not associated with Epstein-Barr virus infection and is generally not curable with treatment regimens for non-Hodgkin lymphomas. In fact, this entity is no longer considered to be a lymphoma and instead represents a unique precursor hematopoietic neoplasm. Acute leukemia therapy regimens may lead to sustained clinical remission of BPDCN, with bone marrow transplantation in first complete remission potentially curative in adult patients.","['Jegalian, Armin G', 'Facchetti, Fabio', 'Jaffe, Elaine S']","['Jegalian AG', 'Facchetti F', 'Jaffe ES']","['Laboratory of Pathology, Hematopathology Section, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Adv Anat Pathol,Advances in anatomic pathology,9435676,PMC6329307,2009/10/24 06:00,2010/01/06 06:00,['2009/10/24 06:00'],"['2009/10/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/06 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/PAP.0b013e3181bb6bc2 [doi]', '00125480-200911000-00003 [pii]']",ppublish,Adv Anat Pathol. 2009 Nov;16(6):392-404. doi: 10.1097/PAP.0b013e3181bb6bc2.,6,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cell Lineage', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dendritic Cells/immunology/*pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Toll-Like Receptors/immunology']",151,['0 (Toll-Like Receptors)'],,,['Z01 BC011070-01/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],,,['NIHMS1004217'],,,,,,,,,,

Here, we used natural product Radicicol (Rad), a macrocyclic antifungal, as an Hsp90 inhibitor to investigate the effect of Bcr-Abl inactivation on erythroid gene expression and subsequently on the transcription factors involved in their regulation. We showed that all erythroid genes studied were over-expressed after Rad treatment while Bcr-Abl expression was inhibited. Specific transcription factor NF-E2 was induced in Rad-treated cells as well as GATA-1 cofactors Friend of GATA (FOG)1 and SP1, whereas PU.1 was downregulated. Moreover, p38 mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibition prevented Rad-mediated differentiation of K562 in correlation with decreased gamma-globin expression and suppression of Rad-mediated inhibition of PU.1.

Microarray analysis on 128 tumorigenesis related genes showed that ZnPP suppressed genes involved in cell proliferation and angiogenesis. Among these genes, CYCLIN D1 (CCND1) was specifically inhibited as were its mRNA and protein levels. Additionally, ZnPP inhibited CCND1 promoter activity through an Sp1 and Egr1 overlapping binding site (S/E). We confirmed that ZnPP modulated the S/E site, at least partially by associating with Sp1 and Egr1 proteins rather than direct binding to DNA targets. Furthermore, administration of ZnPP significantly inhibited cyclin D1 expression and progression of a B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 1 tumor in mice by preferentially targeting tumor cells. These observations show HO independent effects of ZnPP on cyclin D1 expression and tumorigenesis.","['La, Ping', 'Fernando, Amal P', 'Wang, Zhi', 'Salahudeen, Ameen', 'Yang, Guang', 'Lin, Qing', 'Wright, Clyde J', 'Dennery, Phyllis A']","['La P', 'Fernando AP', 'Wang Z', 'Salahudeen A', 'Yang G', 'Lin Q', 'Wright CJ', 'Dennery PA']","[""Division of Neonatology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104."", ""Division of Neonatology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104."", ""Division of Neonatology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104."", ""Division of Neonatology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104."", ""Division of Neonatology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104."", ""Division of Neonatology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104; Department of Pediatrics, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104."", ""Division of Neonatology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104."", ""Division of Neonatology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104; Department of Pediatrics, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104.

DESIGN AND METHODS: The registry, which was activated in 2004 and closed in 2007, collected data on patients with acute myeloid leukemia, admitted to 21 hematologic divisions in tertiary care centers or university hospitals in Italy, who developed proven or probable invasive aspergillosis. RESULTS: One hundred and forty cases of invasive aspergillosis were collected, with most cases occurring during the period of post-induction aplasia, the highest risk phase in acute myeloid leukemia. The mortality rate attributable to invasive aspergillosis was 27%, confirming previous reports of a downward trend in this rate. Univariate and multivariate analyses revealed that the stage of acute myeloid leukemia and the duration of, and recovery from, neutropenia were independent prognostic factors. We analyzed outcomes after treatment with the three most frequently used drugs (liposomal amphotericin B, caspofungin, voriconazole). No differences emerged in survival at day 120 or in the overall response rate which was 71%, ranging from 61% with caspofungin to 84% with voriconazole. CONCLUSIONS: Our series confirms the downward trend in mortality rates reported in previous series, with all new drugs providing similar survival and response rates. Recovery from neutropenia and disease stage are crucial prognostic factors. Efficacious antifungal drugs bridge the period of maximum risk due to poor hematologic and immunological reconstitution.","['Pagano, Livio', 'Caira, Morena', 'Candoni, Anna', 'Offidani, Massimo', 'Martino, Bruno', 'Specchia, Giorgina', 'Pastore, Domenico', 'Stanzani, Marta', 'Cattaneo, Chiara', 'Fanci, Rosa', 'Caramatti, Cecilia', 'Rossini, Fausto', 'Luppi, Mario', 'Potenza, Leonardo', 'Ferrara, Felicetto', 'Mitra, Maria Enza', 'Fadda, Rafaela Maria', 'Invernizzi, Rosangela', 'Aloisi, Teresa', 'Picardi, Marco', 'Bonini, Alessandro', 'Vacca, Adriana', 'Chierichini, Anna', 'Melillo, Lorella', 'de Waure, Chiara', 'Fianchi, Luana', 'Riva, Marta', 'Leone, Giuseppe', 'Aversa, Franco', 'Nosari, Annamaria']","['Pagano L', 'Caira M', 'Candoni A', 'Offidani M', 'Martino B', 'Specchia G', 'Pastore D', 'Stanzani M', 'Cattaneo C', 'Fanci R', 'Caramatti C', 'Rossini F', 'Luppi M', 'Potenza L', 'Ferrara F', 'Mitra ME', 'Fadda RM', 'Invernizzi R', 'Aloisi T', 'Picardi M', 'Bonini A', 'Vacca A', 'Chierichini A', 'Melillo L', 'de Waure C', 'Fianchi L', 'Riva M', 'Leone G', 'Aversa F', 'Nosari A']","['M.D. Istituto di Ematologia, Universita Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, Largo Francesco Vito, 1 I-00168 Roma, Italia. lpagano@rm.unicatt.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091022,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,PMC2857195,2009/10/24 06:00,2010/08/25 06:00,['2009/10/24 06:00'],"['2009/10/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/25 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2009.012054 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2009.012054 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2010 Apr;95(4):644-50. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2009.012054.

SUMMARY: APL is most often characterized by the hallmark reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 15 and 17, leading to the fusion of the promyelocytic gene and retinoic acid receptor alpha. Arsenic's therapeutic utility as an antileukemic agent was first described in the late 18th century. Arsenic trioxide demonstrates a dual, dose-dependent mechanism of action and can induce both partial myeloid differentiation and apoptosis. Arsenic trioxide is generally well tolerated, with reversible toxicities rarely requiring discontinuation of therapy. Toxicities associated with arsenic trioxide include leukocytosis, Q-T interval prolongation, APL differentiation syndrome, and hepatotoxicity. Since 2000, arsenic trioxide has been used as the standard of care for relapsed APL, with remission rates greater than 80% as a single agent. In an attempt to maximize disease-free survival and minimize relapse rates in patients with APL, arsenic trioxide is now being investigated as first-line therapy in the management of APL, with several studies showing promising outcomes. When used alone or in combination with tretinoin, the rates of complete remission have exceeded 85%, with high rates of molecular remission. CONCLUSION: Arsenic trioxide, alone or in combination with tretinoin, as first-line therapy in newly diagnosed APL has resulted in high rates of complete remission and molecular remission. Arsenic trioxide combined with tretinoin has shortened the time to achieve complete remission and lengthened disease-free survival, findings that suggest the usefulness of the regimen as first-line treatment for APL.","['Leu, Lily', 'Mohassel, Leila']","['Leu L', 'Mohassel L']","['Department of Pharmacy, Inova Fairfax Hospital, Falls Church, VA, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Am J Health Syst Pharm,American journal of health-system pharmacy : AJHP : official journal of the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists,9503023,,2009/10/24 06:00,2010/01/19 06:00,['2009/10/24 06:00'],"['2009/10/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/19 06:00 [medline]']","['66/21/1913 [pii]', '10.2146/ajhp080342 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Health Syst Pharm. 2009 Nov 1;66(21):1913-8. doi: 10.2146/ajhp080342.,21,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/administration & dosage/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Oxides/administration & dosage/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Tretinoin/administration & dosage']",,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We show here that the SCL/TAL1 transcription factor is highly expressed in LT-HSCs compared with short-term reconstituting HSCs and progenitors and that SCL negatively regulates the G(0)-G(1) transit of LT-HSCs. Furthermore, when SCL protein levels are decreased by gene targeting or by RNA interference, the reconstitution potential of HSCs is impaired in several transplantation assays. First, the mean stem cell activity of HSCs transplanted at approximately 1 competitive repopulating unit was 2-fold decreased when Scl gene dosage was decreased. Second, Scl(+/-) HSCs were at a marked competitive disadvantage with Scl(+/+) cells when transplanted at 4 competitive repopulating units equivalent. Third, reconstitution of the stem cell pool by adult HSCs expressing Scl-directed shRNAs was decreased compared with controls. At the molecular level, we found that SCL occupies the Cdkn1a and Id1 loci in primary hematopoietic cells and that the expression levels of these 2 regulators of HSC cell cycle and long-term functions are sensitive to Scl gene dosage. Together, our observations suggest that SCL impedes G(0)-G(1) transition in HSCs and regulates their long-term competence.","['Lacombe, Julie', 'Herblot, Sabine', 'Rojas-Sutterlin, Shanti', 'Haman, Andre', 'Barakat, Stephane', 'Iscove, Norman N', 'Sauvageau, Guy', 'Hoang, Trang']","['Lacombe J', 'Herblot S', 'Rojas-Sutterlin S', 'Haman A', 'Barakat S', 'Iscove NN', 'Sauvageau G', 'Hoang T']","['Institute of Research in Immunology and Cancer (IRIC), Montreal, QC, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091022,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,2009/10/24 06:00,2010/03/13 06:00,['2009/10/24 06:00'],"['2009/10/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/13 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)49278-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2009-01-201384 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 Jan 28;115(4):792-803. doi: 10.1182/blood-2009-01-201384.

Transcriptome analysis after ectopic transfection of synthetic miR-29b into leukemia cells indicates that miR-29b target apoptosis, cell cycle, and proliferation pathways.

In most cases, neoplastic cells display the D816V-mutated variant of KIT. KIT D816V exhibits constitutive tyrosine kinase (TK) activity and has been implicated in increased survival and growth of neoplastic MCs. Recent data suggest that the proapoptotic BH3-only death regulator Bim plays a role as a tumor suppressor in various myeloid neoplasms. We found that KIT D816V suppresses expression of Bim in Ba/F3 cells. The KIT D816-induced down-regulation of Bim was rescued by the KIT-targeting drug PKC412/midostaurin. Both PKC412 and the proteasome-inhibitor bortezomib were found to decrease growth and promote expression of Bim in MC leukemia cell lines HMC-1.1 (D816V negative) and HMC-1.2 (D816V positive). Both drugs were also found to counteract growth of primary neoplastic MCs. Furthermore, midostaurin was found to cooperate with bortezomib and with the BH3-mimetic obatoclax in producing growth inhibition in both HMC-1 subclones.

This has led to greatly increased response rates and durations of response but not yet improved survival. Advances in the use of prognostic factors that identify patients at high risk for progression have led us to the question whether there is still a role for a ""watch and wait"" approach in asymptomatic high-risk patients or whether they should be treated earlier in their disease course. Questions remain, including, what is the optimal first-line treatment and its timing and is there any role of maintenance therapy or stem cell transplantation in this disease? CLL is a disease of the elderly and not all patients are eligible for aggressive up-front chemoimmunotherapy regimens, so what is the optimal treatment approach for more frail elderly patients? It is highly likely that our treatment approaches will continue to evolve as the results of ongoing clinical trials are released and that further improvements in the outcome of this disease will result from identification of therapies that target the underlying pathophysiology of CLL.","['Gribben, John G']",['Gribben JG'],"['Institute of Cancer, Queen Mary University of London, Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, London, United Kingdom. j.gribben@qmul.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",20091022,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,PMC2941409,2009/10/24 06:00,2010/01/29 06:00,['2009/10/24 06:00'],"['2009/10/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/29 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)49349-8 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2009-08-207126 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 Jan 14;115(2):187-97. doi: 10.1182/blood-2009-08-207126.

Some patients exhibit leukemic transformation (LT) by unknown mechanisms, and chemotherapy may increase the risk of LT. To clarify the molecular mechanisms of LT, gene alterations involved in LT from patients in the chronic phase (CP) of MPNs were identified. Among 18 patients who progressed to leukemia, AML1/RUNX1 mutations were detected in 5 patients at the LT but in none at the CP. To investigate the leukemogenic effect of AML1/RUNX1 mutants, the AML1D171N mutant was transduced into CD34(+) cells from patients in the CP of MPNs. The D171N transduction resulted in proliferation of immature myeloid cells, enhanced self-renewal capacity, and proliferation of primitive progenitors. Taken together, these results indicate that AML1/RUNX1 point mutations may have a leukemogenic potential in MPN stem cells, and they may promote leukemic transformation in MPN.","['Ding, Ye', 'Harada, Yuka', 'Imagawa, Jun', 'Kimura, Akiro', 'Harada, Hironori']","['Ding Y', 'Harada Y', 'Imagawa J', 'Kimura A', 'Harada H']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Research Institute for Radiation Biology and Medicine, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,2009/10/24 06:00,2010/01/09 06:00,['2009/10/24 06:00'],"['2009/10/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/09 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)38847-9 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2009-06-223982 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2009 Dec 10;114(25):5201-5. doi: 10.1182/blood-2009-06-223982.,25,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*genetics/metabolism', 'Female', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Leukemia/genetics/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/genetics/*pathology', '*Point Mutation', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'Transfection']",,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We examined the effects of DAS on WEHI-3 in vivo and the results indicated that DAS decreased the percentage of Mac-3 and CD11b, indicating that the differentiation of the precursor of macrophage cells was inhibited. DAS stimulated the percentage of CD3 and CD19, indicating that the differentiation of the precursor of T and B cells promoted. The weights of liver and spleen indicated that DAS decreased the weight of these organs after being compared to the control groups.

A cluster of abnormalities that contribute to the metabolic syndrome may be expressed at a higher level and therefore result in an increased risk for diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular diseases. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We investigated a single-centre cohort of 500 adult survivors (228 females) of childhood cancer, median age 28 years (range 18-59 years) and median follow-up time 19 years (range 6-49 years). We measured total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, body mass index and the prevalence of diabetes mellitus. Data from the epidemiological Monitoring van Risicofactoren en Gezondheid in Nederland (MORGEN) study were used to calculate standard deviation scores as normative values. RESULTS: The criteria of the metabolic syndrome were met in 13% of the total cohort. Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) survivors treated with cranial irradiation had an increased risk of developing the metabolic syndrome compared with ALL survivors not treated with cranial irradiation (23% versus 7%, P = 0.011), probably determined by higher prevalence of overweight and hypertension. CONCLUSION: Adult survivors of childhood cancer, especially those treated with cranial irradiation, are at increased risk of developing the metabolic syndrome.","['van Waas, M', 'Neggers, S J C M M', 'Pieters, R', 'van den Heuvel-Eibrink, M M']","['van Waas M', 'Neggers SJ', 'Pieters R', 'van den Heuvel-Eibrink MM']","[""Department of Paediatric Oncology-Haematology, Erasmus Medical Centre, Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20091022,England,Ann Oncol,Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology,9007735,,2009/10/24 06:00,2010/08/18 06:00,['2009/10/24 06:00'],"['2009/10/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/18 06:00 [medline]']","['S0923-7534(19)39204-X [pii]', '10.1093/annonc/mdp414 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Oncol. 2010 May;21(5):1121-6. doi: 10.1093/annonc/mdp414.

Both diseases show a spectrum and the boundary of them remains unclear. The purpose of this study is to draw a prognostic model of total NK cell neoplasms. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 172 patients (22 with ANKL and 150 with ENKL). The ENKLs consisted of 123 nasal and 27 extranasal (16 cutaneous, 9 hepatosplenic, 1 intestinal and 1 nodal) lymphomas. RESULTS: Complete remission rate for ENKL was 73% in stage I, but 15% in stage IV, which was consistent with that for ANKL (18%). The prognosis of ENKL was better than that of ANKL (median survival 10 versus 1.9 months, P < 0.0001) but was comparable when restricted to stage IV cases (4.0 months, P = 0.16). Multivariate analysis showed that four factors (non-nasal type, stage, performance status and numbers of extranodal involvement) were significant prognostic factors. Using these four variables, an NK prognostic index was successfully constructed. Four-year overall survival of patients with zero, one, two and three or four adverse factors were 55%, 33%, 15% and 6%, respectively.

Matrix-assisted autologous chondrocyte implantation (MACI) was performed with harvested chondrocytes after imaging had indicated vital bone remodelling. Rehabilitation was according to MACI guidelines and after 5.5 years, the patient shows continuous clinical improvement and is satisfied with the result.

The HSP90 molecular chaperone is expressed at high levels in a wide variety of human cancers including melanoma, leukemia, and cancers in colon, prostate, lung, and breast. In cancer cells dependent upon mutated and/or over-expressed oncogene proteins, HSP90 is thought to have a critical role in regulating the stability, folding, and activity of HSP90-associated proteins, so-called ""client proteins"". These client proteins include the growth-stimulating proteins and kinases that support malignant transformation. Recently, oncogenic activating BRAF mutants have been identified in variety of cancers where constitutive activation of the MEK/ERK MAPK signaling pathway is the key for tumorigenesis, and they have been shown to be client proteins for HSP90. Accordingly, HSP90 inhibition can suppress certain cancer-causing client proteins and therefore represents an important therapeutic target. The molecular mechanism underlying the anti-cancer effect of HSP90 inhibition is complicated. Geldanamycin and its derivatives have been shown to induce the depletion of mutationally-activated BRAF through several mechanisms. In this review, we will describe the HSP90-inhibitory mechanism, focusing on recent progress in understanding HSP90 chaperone structure-function relationships, the identification of new HSP90 client proteins and the development of HSP90 inhibitors for clinical applications.","['Fukuyo, Yayoi', 'Hunt, Clayton R', 'Horikoshi, Nobuo']","['Fukuyo Y', 'Hunt CR', 'Horikoshi N']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO 63108, United States.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20091021,Ireland,Cancer Lett,Cancer letters,7600053,,2009/10/24 06:00,2010/04/08 06:00,['2009/10/24 06:00'],"['2009/05/26 00:00 [received]', '2009/07/13 00:00 [revised]', '2009/07/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/10/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/08 06:00 [medline]']","['S0304-3835(09)00499-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.canlet.2009.07.010 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Lett. 2010 Apr 1;290(1):24-35. doi: 10.1016/j.canlet.2009.07.010.

METHODS: The medical records of 688 children with acute leukemia (age< or =15 years) who were initially diagnosed at Blood Disease Hospital of Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences from October 2003 to June 2006 were retrospectively studied. RESULTS: Four hundred children were diagnosed as acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), with a peak incidence at ages of 1-4 years. Two hundred and eighteen children were classified into B-cell ALL, and 34 into T-cell ALL. In the 154 patients with cytogenetic data, high hyperdiploidy was presented in 13.0% of patients, low hyperdiploidy in 3.9%, pseudodiploidy in 5.2%, and hypodiploidy in 5.8%. E2A-PBX1 fusion gene was expressed in 3.9% of children with B-cell ALL. Two hundred and twenty-two children were diagnosed as acute myeloid leukemia (AML), with a peak incidence at ages of 10-15 years. AML-M2 was the most common subtype. Acute hybrid leukemia (AHL) was confirmed in 24 children (4.2%), with a median age of 9 years. Seventy-four percent of the children with (AHL) had mainly CD13 and CD33 expression in myeloid antigen integral. CONCLUSIONS: There are differences in the biologic features of childhood acute leukemia between the northern region of China and other regions and races, which suggests that there might be differences in the pathogenesis of childhood acute leukemia in different environmental exposures.","['Guo, Ye', 'Chen, Yu-Mei', 'Zou, Yao', 'Chen, Xiao-Juan', 'Zhang, Li', 'Wang, Shu-Chun', 'Zhu, Xiao-Fan']","['Guo Y', 'Chen YM', 'Zou Y', 'Chen XJ', 'Zhang L', 'Wang SC', 'Zhu XF']","['Institute of Hematology and Blood Disease Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Tianjin 300020, China. zhuxiaof@yahoo.com.cn']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,China,Zhongguo Dang Dai Er Ke Za Zhi,Zhongguo dang dai er ke za zhi = Chinese journal of contemporary pediatrics,100909956,,2009/10/24 06:00,2010/03/12 06:00,['2009/10/24 06:00'],"['2009/10/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/12 06:00 [medline]']",['1008-8830(2009)10-0793-04 [pii]'],ppublish,Zhongguo Dang Dai Er Ke Za Zhi. 2009 Oct;11(10):793-6.,10,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'China/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/epidemiology/*genetics/immunology', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/epidemiology/*genetics/immunology', 'Retrospective Studies']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We also found a direct interaction between polycomb group genes and the WNT signaling pathway in chronic myeloid leukemia transformation. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay (ChIP), and mass spectrometry assays identified noncanonical WNT pathway members, such as WNT5A and WNT11, bound to the SUZ12 promoter. Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence with WNT5A and WNT11 antibodies confirmed nuclear localization. Knockdown of WNTs 1, 5A, and 11 with RNAi approaches showed that WNT members are capable of activating SUZ12 transcription with varying promoter affinities.

Compounds bearing o-hydroxy or 3,5-dimethoxy groups on phenolic rings (CaA, SA, and ChA) were remarkably more effective at causing DNA damage than the compounds bearing no such groups; furthermore, CaA was the most active among the HCAs examined. The involvement of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and Cu(I) ions in the DNA damage was affirmed by the inhibition of the DNA breakage by using specific scavengers of ROS and a Cu(I) chelator. The interaction between CaA and Cu(II) ions and the influence of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), the solvent, and pH value on the interaction were also studied to help elucidate the detailed prooxidant mechanism by using UV/Vis spectroscopic analysis. On the basis of these observations, it is proposed that it is the CaA phenolate anion, instead of the parent molecule, that chelates with the Cu(II) ion as a bidentate ligand, hence facilitating the intramolecular electron transfer to form the corresponding CaA semiquinone radical intermediate. The latter undergoes a second electron transfer with oxygen to form the corresponding o-quinone and a superoxide, which play a pivotal role in the DNA damage. The intermediacy of the semiquinone radical was supported by isolation of its dimer from the Cu(II)-mediated oxidation products. Intriguingly, CaA was also the most cytotoxic compound among the HCAs toward human promyelocytic leukemia (HL-60) cell proliferation. Addition of exogenous Cu(II) ions resulted in an effect dichotomy on cell viability depending on the concentration of CaA; that is, low concentrations of CaA enhanced the cell viability and, conversely, high concentrations of CaA almost completely inhibited the cell proliferation. On the other hand, when superoxide dismutase was added before, the two stimulation effects of exogenous Cu(II) ions were significantly ameliorated, thus clearly indicating that the oxidative-stress level regulates cell proliferation and death. These findings provide direct evidence for the antioxidant/prooxidant mechanism of cancer chemoprevention.","['Fan, Gui-Juan', 'Jin, Xiao-Ling', 'Qian, Yi-Ping', 'Wang, Qi', 'Yang, Ru-Ting', 'Dai, Fang', 'Tang, Jiang-Jiang', 'Shang, Ya-Jing', 'Cheng, Li-Xia', 'Yang, Jie', 'Zhou, Bo']","['Fan GJ', 'Jin XL', 'Qian YP', 'Wang Q', 'Yang RT', 'Dai F', 'Tang JJ', 'Shang YJ', 'Cheng LX', 'Yang J', 'Zhou B']","['State Key Laboratory of Applied Organic Chemistry, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, Gansu 730000, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Germany,Chemistry,"Chemistry (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany)",9513783,,2009/10/23 06:00,2010/03/03 06:00,['2009/10/23 06:00'],"['2009/10/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/chem.200901627 [doi]'],ppublish,Chemistry. 2009 Nov 23;15(46):12889-99. doi: 10.1002/chem.200901627.,46,IM,"['Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Copper/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Coumaric Acids/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'DNA/*chemistry/metabolism', 'DNA Breaks/drug effects', 'Edetic Acid/chemistry', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Plasmids/chemistry/metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Solvents/chemistry', 'Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",,"['0 (Coumaric Acids)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Solvents)', '789U1901C5 (Copper)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', '9G34HU7RV0 (Edetic Acid)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The combination of these 2 drugs were used in 9 multiple relapsed or refractory ALL children on the basis of: DNX weekly 100 mg/m2 D1, 8, 15. PEG-ASPA single, 2500IU/m2 dose D15. Vinca alkaloids and corticosteroids were associated. RESULTS: Median hospital stay was 4 days (0-55). COMPLICATIONS: Neutropenia grade IV n=4, grade III infection n=6, grade II cardiac toxicity n=1, grade III allergy, grade III hemostasis disorders, thrombosis, n=1 respectively. All patients achieved complete remission (CR) except one who died from disease progression. 8 patients were subjected to hematopoietic stem cell transplantatation (HSCT). Two patients of them are alive and well, 4 died from transplant related causes and 2 from disease progression. CONCLUSION: Salvage treatment containing DNX and PEG-ASPA, of small sample childhood ALL with very advanced disease, is feasible as regard toxicity and response rate allowing to HSCT and possible cure.","['Sedki, Mohamed', 'Vannier, Jean-Pierre', 'Leverger, Guy', 'Yakouben, Karima', 'Adjaoud, Dalila', 'Vilmer, Etienne', 'Baruchel, Andre']","['Sedki M', 'Vannier JP', 'Leverger G', 'Yakouben K', 'Adjaoud D', 'Vilmer E', 'Baruchel A']","[""The Department of Service d'Hematologie-Immunologie Pediatrique, Hopital Robert Debre, Paris, France. msedky64@yahoo.com""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,J Egypt Natl Canc Inst,Journal of the Egyptian National Cancer Institute,9424566,,2008/03/01 00:00,2010/01/06 06:00,['2009/10/23 06:00'],"['2009/10/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2008/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/06 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,J Egypt Natl Canc Inst. 2008 Mar;20(1):55-62.,1,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Child', '*Compassionate Use Trials', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Polyethylene Glycols/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Salvage Therapy']",,"['3WJQ0SDW1A (Polyethylene Glycols)', '7D96IR0PPM (pegaspargase)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The medical records of patients referred for PSI during the time period from 1990 to 2005 were retrospectively reviewed. We compared the three most common planning techniques (two parallel opposing, single direct field, anterior and lateral fields). RESULTS: Eighteen patients who received PSI were identified. Thirteen patients were diagnosed as CML and 5 as CLL. The mean age of the patients was 44 (+/-16) years and the majority were men (60%). Spleen enlargement was documented in all cases. The single direct anterior field was the most commonly used technique. The dose per fraction ranged from 25 cGy to 100 cGy. The total dose ranged from 125 cGy to 1200 cGy and the median was 200 cGy (mean 327 cGy). There was no significant difference between CML and CLL patients regarding the dose level. Three out of 5 CLL patients and only one out of 13 CML patients received re-irradiation. All patients showed subjective improvement regarding pain and swelling. There was a significant increase in the hemoglobin level and a significant decrease in the WBC count. The single direct field shows variations in the dose from 56 to 102%; however, it is the simplest and the best regarding the dose to the surrounding normal tissues especially the kidney and the liver. CONCLUSION: PSI has a significant palliative benefit. Although the most widely accepted technique is the 2 parallel opposing anterior-posterior fields, single anterior field is also considered as a suitable option. Higher doses are needed for CLL patients compared to CML patients.","['Nazmy, Mohamed Soliman', 'Radwan, Aida', 'Mokhtar, Maha']","['Nazmy MS', 'Radwan A', 'Mokhtar M']","['The Department of Radiotherapy, National Cancer Institute, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt. mnazmy@hotmail.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,J Egypt Natl Canc Inst,Journal of the Egyptian National Cancer Institute,9424566,,2008/03/01 00:00,2010/01/06 06:00,['2009/10/23 06:00'],"['2009/10/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2008/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/06 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,J Egypt Natl Canc Inst. 2008 Mar;20(1):31-5.,1,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*radiotherapy', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*radiotherapy', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Palliative Care', 'Radiotherapy Dosage', 'Spleen/*radiation effects']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The rs12343867 SNP (C/T) tags this haplotype. A total of 130 patients (77 VF-positive) with primary myelofibrosis (PMF) were analyzed for this informative SNP, using bone marrow-derived DNA. The observed 46/1 C allele frequencies in VF-positive (50%) and VF-negative (36%) patients were both significantly higher than expected in population controls (P<0.01). Genotype distributions in VF-positive/VF-negative patients were CC 31%/9%, CT 38%/53% and TT 31%/38% (P=0.01). CC genotype/C-allele frequencies in patients with <20% VF mutation burden (12%/37%) were similar (P=0.95) to those seen in VF-negative patients (9%/36%), but were significantly lower (P<0.01) than those seen in the presence of >50% mutation burden ( approximately 67%/71%). The rs12343867 genotype did not correlate with the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) score or karyotype. Unexpectedly, the TT genotype was associated with shortened survival (P<0.01), which was not accounted for by IPSS score or VF allele burden. We conclude that JAK2 germline genetic variation affects disease susceptibility, and possibly survival, in PMF, regardless of VF mutational status. Allelic distortion from acquired uniparental disomy contributes to the appearance of a more pronounced effect on disease susceptibility in VF-positive patients, when studying clonally affected tissue.","['Tefferi, A', 'Lasho, T L', 'Patnaik, M M', 'Finke, C M', 'Hussein, K', 'Hogan, W J', 'Elliott, M A', 'Litzow, M R', 'Hanson, C A', 'Pardanani, A']","['Tefferi A', 'Lasho TL', 'Patnaik MM', 'Finke CM', 'Hussein K', 'Hogan WJ', 'Elliott MA', 'Litzow MR', 'Hanson CA', 'Pardanani A']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, 200 First Street SW, Rochester, MN 55905, USA. tefferi.ayalew@mayo.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20091022,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,2009/10/23 06:00,2010/01/28 06:00,['2009/10/23 06:00'],"['2009/10/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/28 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2009225 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2009.225 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2010 Jan;24(1):105-9. doi: 10.1038/leu.2009.225.

Here we investigated the function of RhoH in the B-cell lineage. B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling was intact in Rhoh(-/-) mice. Because RhoH interacts with ZAP70, which is a prognostic factor in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), we analyzed the mRNA levels of RhoH in primary human CLL cells and showed a 2.3-fold higher RhoH expression compared with normal B cells. RhoH expression in CLL positively correlated with the protein levels of ZAP70. Deletion of Rhoh in a murine model of CLL (Emu-TCL1(Tg) mice) significantly delayed the accumulation of CD5(+)IgM(+) leukemic cells in peripheral blood and the leukemic burden in the peritoneal cavity, bone marrow and spleen of Rhoh(-/-) mice compared with their Rhoh(+/+) counterparts. Phosphorylation of AKT and ERK in response to BCR stimulation was notably decreased in Emu-TCL1(Tg);Rhoh(-/-) splenocytes.

There was some correlation between the CC(50) and the dipole moment for HSC-4 cells (r(2)=0.273), between the CC and log P for HL-60 and HSC-3 cells (r(2) 50 =0.191-0.212), and between the CC(50) and distance of C-R(2) (at three dimensional configuration) (r(2)=0.394) and molecular weight (r(2)=0.292) for HL-60 cells. On the other hand, there was little or no correlation between the CC(50) and other descriptors. The present study demonstrated the dependency of the cytotoxicity of 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline derivatives on hydrophobicity and distance between C-R(2) in the 3-dimensional configuration. These descriptors obtained from the CONFLEX/PM5 method may be utilized as a tool to analyze the biological effect of 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolines.","['Ishihara, Mariko', 'Hatano, Hajime', 'Takekawa, Fumihiro', 'Kawase, Masami', 'Sakagami, Hiroshi']","['Ishihara M', 'Hatano H', 'Takekawa F', 'Kawase M', 'Sakagami H']","['Division of Basic Chemistry, Department of Oral Biology and Tissue Engineering, Meikai University School of Dentistry, Sakado, Saitama 350-0283, Japan. mariko@dent.meikai.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,,2009/10/23 06:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/10/23 06:00'],"['2009/10/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']",['29/10/4077 [pii]'],ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2009 Oct;29(10):4077-82.,10,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/drug therapy', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Mouth Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tetrahydroisoquinolines/*chemistry/*pharmacology']",,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Tetrahydroisoquinolines)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At several time-points the expression levels of P-gp, BCRP and GSTpi were determined. RESULTS: After exposure to Ara-C, P-gp mRNA rapidly increased in all the cell lines. P-gp protein was detected in the sensitive cells after 8 h exposure to Ara-C. GSTpi mRNA increased in the resistant cells, but no change in BCRP mRNA was observed. Exposure to DNR revealed rapidly increased P-gp and GSTpi mRNA in the resistant cells.

The effects of the ligands on cell growth, cleavage of Notch1, and the expression of various genes were examined by cell culture, immunoblotting, and quantitative RT-PCR, respectively. RESULTS: Ligand stimulation suppressed the growth of the THP-1 cells but promoted that of the TMD7 cells. Immunoblots showed two cleaved Notch1 bands, which became intense with different peak time from the start of stimulation. Ligand stimulation changed the expression levels of various genes related to cell proliferation. Some genes changed in opposite directions in the two cell lines.

A novel approach to overcome chemotherapy resistance may be targeting the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). PATIENTS AND METHODS: The involvement of the unfolded protein response (UPR) in the cell killing effect of xanthohumol (X) was examined in 18 patient samples. RESULTS: X-induced apoptosis of CLL cells was accompanied by the induction of glucose-regulated protein of 78 kDa (GRP78) and heat-shock protein of 70 kDa (Hsp70) protein levels and by sustained phosphorylation of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2alpha), suggesting the involvement of the ER stress transducer, the double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase (PKR)-like ER kinase (PERK). The X-box-binding protein 1 (XBP1) mRNA was spliced but no clear activation of activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) was observed. The proapoptotic outcome was further demonstrated by the up-regulation of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) homologous protein (CHOP), down-regulation of myeloid cell leukemia 1 (Mcl-1) and B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), cleavage of poly-(ADP)-ribose polymerase (PARP) and processing of caspase-3, -4 and -9. Furthermore, X showed proteasome inhibitory activity. CONCLUSION: X stimulates the proapoptotic arm of the UPR in ex vivo CLL cells, suggesting that ER stress may play an important role during X-induced apoptosis.","['Lust, Sofie', 'Vanhoecke, Barbara', 'VAN Gele, Mireille', 'Boelens, Jerina', 'VAN Melckebeke, Heleen', 'Kaileh, Mary', 'Vanden Berghe, Wim', 'Haegeman, Guy', 'Philippe, Jan', 'Bracke, Marc', 'Offner, Fritz']","['Lust S', 'Vanhoecke B', 'VAN Gele M', 'Boelens J', 'VAN Melckebeke H', 'Kaileh M', 'Vanden Berghe W', 'Haegeman G', 'Philippe J', 'Bracke M', 'Offner F']","['Ghent University Hospital, Department of Hematology, De Pintelaan 185, 1P7, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.

Moreover, HIV-1 integrase interacted with recombinant transportin 3 protein under conditions whereby Moloney murine leukemia virus (MLV) integrase failed to do so, suggesting that integrase-transportin 3 interactions might underscore active retroviral PIC nuclear import. Here we correlate infectivity defects in transportin 3 knockdown cells with in vitro protein binding affinities for an expanded set of retroviruses that include simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), bovine immunodeficiency virus (BIV), equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV), feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), and Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) to critically address the role of integrase-transportin 3 interactions in viral infection. Lentiviruses, with the exception of FIV, display a requirement for transportin 3 in comparison to MLV and RSV, yielding an infection-based dependency ranking of SIV > HIV-1 > BIV and EIAV > MLV, RSV, and FIV. In vitro pulldown and surface plasmon resonance assays, in contrast, define a notably different integrase-transportin 3 binding hierarchy: FIV, HIV-1, and BIV > SIV and MLV > EIAV. Our results therefore fail to support a critical role for integrase binding in dictating transportin 3 dependency during retrovirus infection. In addition to integrase, capsid has been highlighted as a retroviral nuclear import determinant. Accordingly, MLV/HIV-1 chimera viruses pinpoint the genetic determinant of sensitization to transportin 3 knockdown to the HIV-1 capsid protein. We therefore conclude that capsid, not integrase, is the dominant viral factor that dictates transportin 3 dependency during HIV-1 infection.","['Krishnan, Lavanya', 'Matreyek, Kenneth A', 'Oztop, Ilker', 'Lee, Kyeongeun', 'Tipper, Christopher H', 'Li, Xiang', 'Dar, Mohd J', 'Kewalramani, Vineet N', 'Engelman, Alan']","['Krishnan L', 'Matreyek KA', 'Oztop I', 'Lee K', 'Tipper CH', 'Li X', 'Dar MJ', 'Kewalramani VN', 'Engelman A']","['Department of Cancer Immunology and AIDS, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02115, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091021,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,PMC2798409,2009/10/23 06:00,2010/01/22 06:00,['2009/10/23 06:00'],"['2009/10/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/22 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.01899-09 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.01899-09 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2010 Jan;84(1):397-406. doi: 10.1128/JVI.01899-09.

The tumor cell immunophenotype was CD56(+)CD3(-)CD4(-), with no B-cell- or myeloid-associated markers. The genotype was of the germ-line configuration of T-cell receptor genes, and no association with Epstein-Barr virus was evident, leading to a diagnosis of NK-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma.

However, little is known about mechanisms underlying the conversion from oxidative signaling to downstream activities leading cells to death. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We here report a systematic detection of transcriptome changes in response to oxidative signals generated in leukemia cells upon fenretinide treatment, implicating the occurrence of numerous stress-responsive events during the fenretinide induced apoptosis, such as redox response, endoplasmic reticulum stress/unfolded protein response, translational repression and proteasome activation. Moreover, the configuration of these relevant events is primarily orchestrated by stress responsive transcription factors, as typically highlighted by NF-E2-related factor-2 (NRF2) and heat shock factor 1 (HSF1). Several lines of evidence suggest that the coordinated regulation of these transcription factors and thus their downstream genes are involved in converting oxidative signaling into downstream stress-responsive events regulating pro-apoptotic and apoptotic activities at the temporal and spatial levels, typifying oxidative stress-mediated programmed death rather than survival in cancer cells. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This study provides a roadmap for understanding oxidative stress-mediated apoptosis in cancer cells, which may be further developed into more sophisticated therapeutic protocols, as implicated by synergistic induction of cell apoptosis using proteasome inhibitors with fenretinide.","['Wang, Kankan', 'Fang, Hai', 'Xiao, Dakai', 'Zhu, Xuehua', 'He, Miaomiao', 'Pan, Xiaoling', 'Shi, Jiantao', 'Zhang, Hui', 'Jia, Xiaohong', 'Du, Yanzhi', 'Zhang, Ji']","['Wang K', 'Fang H', 'Xiao D', 'Zhu X', 'He M', 'Pan X', 'Shi J', 'Zhang H', 'Jia X', 'Du Y', 'Zhang J']","['State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics and Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Ruijin Hospital affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091021,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,PMC2760443,2009/10/22 06:00,2010/03/13 06:00,['2009/10/22 06:00'],"['2009/05/31 00:00 [received]', '2009/09/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/10/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1371/journal.pone.0007538 [doi]'],epublish,PLoS One. 2009 Oct 21;4(10):e7538. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0007538.,10,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum/metabolism', 'Fenretinide/*chemistry/pharmacology', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Heat Shock Transcription Factors', 'Humans', 'NF-E2-Related Factor 2/*metabolism', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/*pathology', '*Oxidation-Reduction', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Oxygen/metabolism', 'Protease Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Proteasome Inhibitors', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'U937 Cells']",,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (HSF1 protein, human)', '0 (Heat Shock Transcription Factors)', '0 (NF-E2-Related Factor 2)', '0 (NFE2L2 protein, human)', '0 (Protease Inhibitors)', '0 (Proteasome Inhibitors)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '187EJ7QEXL (Fenretinide)', 'S88TT14065 (Oxygen)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With the aim to assess the toxicity of retroviral expression of Mpl as a basis for further development of a gene therapy for this disorder, we expressed Mpl in a murine bone marrow transplantation (BMT) model. Treated mice developed a profound yet transient elevation of multilineage hematopoiesis, which showed morphologic features of a chronic myeloproliferative disorder (CMPD) with progressive pancytopenia. Ten percent of mice (3/27) developed erythroleukemia, associated with insertional activation of Sfpi1 and Fli1. The majority of transplanted mice developed a progressive pancytopenia with histopathological features of a myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)-like disorder. To avoid these adverse reactions, improved retroviral vectors were designed that mediate reduced and more physiological Mpl expression. Self-inactivating gamma-retroviral vectors were constructed that expressed Mpl from the phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) or the murine Mpl promoter.

Clinical data from a phase 1 trial with lumiliximab demonstrated an acceptable toxicity profile in patients with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). We therefore pursued a phase 1/2 dose-escalation study of lumiliximab added to fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab (FCR) in previously treated CLL patients. Thirty-one patients received either 375 mg/m(2) (n = 3) or 500 mg/m(2) (n = 28) of lumiliximab in combination with FCR for 6 cycles. The toxicity profile was similar to that previously reported for FCR in treatment of relapsed CLL. The overall response rate was 65%, with 52% of patients achieving a complete response (CR), which compares favorably with the CR rate previously reported for the FCR regimen alone in relapsed CLL. The estimated median progression-free survival for all responders was 28.7 months. The addition of lumiliximab to FCR therapy is feasible, achieves a high CR rate, and does not appear to enhance toxicity in previously treated patients with CLL. A randomized trial comparing lumiliximab plus FCR with FCR alone is underway to define the benefit of this combination in relapsed CLL.

To determine the role of IL-21 in graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), anti-IL-21 antibody (Ab) was given to recipients of CD25(-)CD4(+) or CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-effectors. IL-21 neutralization attenuated GVHD-related weight loss and prolonged survival. Likewise, a majority of mice receiving IL-21(-/-) CD25(-) T-effectors survived long term, whereas those receiving wild-type T cells died. The latter recipients had higher grades of GVHD in the ileum and colon. Surprisingly, disruption of IL-21 signaling did not affect IL-17 production, although colon-infiltrating T-effector cells had decreased interferon gamma (IFNgamma) and increased IL-4 production. FoxP3(+) Tregs were increased in colons of anti-IL-21 Ab-treated recipients of FoxP3(-) IL-21(-/-) T cells, indicating Treg conversion. Recipients of FoxP3-deficient T-effectors isolated from chimeras were resistant to the GVHD protective effects of IL-21 blockade. Whereas graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) can occur in the absence of IL-21, loss of both IL-21 and perforin expression abrogated GVL. Together, these data indicate that IL-21 suppresses inducible Treg conversion and further suggest that IL-21 blockade is an attractive strategy to reduce GVHD-induced injury.","['Bucher, Christoph', 'Koch, Lisa', 'Vogtenhuber, Christine', 'Goren, Emily', 'Munger, Meghan', 'Panoskaltsis-Mortari, Angela', 'Sivakumar, Pallavur', 'Blazar, Bruce R']","['Bucher C', 'Koch L', 'Vogtenhuber C', 'Goren E', 'Munger M', 'Panoskaltsis-Mortari A', 'Sivakumar P', 'Blazar BR']","['University of Minnesota Cancer Center and Department of Pediatrics, Division of BMT, Minneapolis, MN, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091020,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,PMC2796140,2009/10/22 06:00,2010/01/08 06:00,['2009/10/22 06:00'],"['2009/10/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/08 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)38800-5 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2009-05-221135 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2009 Dec 17;114(26):5375-84. doi: 10.1182/blood-2009-05-221135.

The clinical outcome for patients was hampered by ineffective chemotherapy, and splenectomy was the major therapeutic approach to improve peripheral blood counts. The median survival after diagnosis was 4 years. With the introduction of alpha-interferon in 1984, marked improvements in patient responses were observed. Shortly thereafter, the introduction of the purine nucleoside analogs transformed this disease into a highly treatable form of leukemia, and patients with the classic form of this rare leukemia now have a near-normal life expectancy. However, other clinical entities mimicking this disease do not respond; thus, accurate diagnosis is important. Immunophenotypic features in classic hairy cell leukemia show that the leukemic cells express CD11c, CD25, CD103, and CD123 and display bright CD20. Despite the high percentage of durable complete remissions with modern therapy, the long-term disease-free survival curves have not reached a plateau. Many patients who achieve a complete remission by morphologic criteria have minimal residual disease demonstrable by either flow cytometry or immunohistochemical staining, and this population may be at higher risk for earlier relapse. Continued clinical research is essential to optimize therapy for this disease.","['Grever, Michael R']",['Grever MR'],"['Department of Internal Medicine, Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA. michael.grever@osumc.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20091020,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,PMC2803689,2009/10/22 06:00,2010/01/22 06:00,['2009/10/22 06:00'],"['2009/10/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/22 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)30102-6 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2009-06-195370 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 Jan 7;115(1):21-8. doi: 10.1182/blood-2009-06-195370.

Moreover, we observe a beneficial effect of CHK1 inhibition in high-DNA damage level AML samples treated with 1-beta-d-arabinofuranosylcytosine. In contrast, CHK1 inhibition has no effect on the clonogenic properties of normal hematopoietic progenitors.

In previous studies, efficient leukemia/lymphoma formation on an otherwise wild-type genetic background occurred in mice undergoing whole-body mobilization of transposons, but was accompanied by high levels of embryonic lethality. To explore the utility of SB for large-scale cancer gene discovery projects, we have generated mice that carry combinations of different transposon and transposase transgenes. We have identified a transposon/transposase combination that promotes highly penetrant leukemia/lymphoma formation on an otherwise wild-type genetic background, yet does not cause embryonic lethality. Infiltrating gliomas also occurred at lower penetrance in these mice. SB-induced or accelerated tumors do not harbor large numbers of chromosomal amplifications or deletions, indicating that transposon mobilization likely promotes tumor formation by insertional mutagenesis of cancer genes, and not by promoting wide-scale genomic instability. Cloning of transposon insertions from lymphomas/leukemias identified common insertion sites at known and candidate novel cancer genes. These data indicate that a high mutagenesis rate can be achieved using SB without high levels of embryonic lethality or genomic instability.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed the radiologic and pathologic records of bone biopsies scheduled at our institution between 2002 and 2007. The following parameters were recorded: indication, type of primary cancer, date of diagnosis, complications of biopsy, whether the sample was of diagnostic quality, pathologic finding, and thus whether the primary malignant tumor was concordant with the lesion sampled. RESULTS: Fifty-four of 55 patients (17 men, 37 women; mean age, 67 years) with known primary cancer and suspicious bone lesions underwent biopsy. One of the 55 patients did not undergo biopsy because a sacral insufficiency fracture was confidently diagnosed at CT. The primary malignant disease had been diagnosed up to 16 years before the new bone lesion was suspected and bone biopsy performed. Cancer types included those of genitourinary tract, breast, thyroid, gastrointestinal tract, and lung and lymphoma and myeloma. Diagnostic material was obtained in 43 of 54 cases (80%), and nondiagnostic material was obtained in 11 of 54 cases (20%). Forty-two of 43 positive biopsy findings (98%) were consistent with the primary malignant tumor. The other positive finding was a new malignant tumor. This new tumor was myelofibrosis in a man with chronic myelocytic leukemia. The primary diagnosis correlated highly with that of the new bone lesion (Spearman's test, R = 0.842; p < 0.001). No complications, including hemorrhage, infection, sinus track formation, fracture, and pneumothorax, were encountered. CONCLUSION: In a patient with known primary malignant disease, the probability is low (2%) that biopsy of a new suspicious bone lesion will show the lesion is other than metastasis from the primary tumor.","['Cronin, Carmel G', 'Cashell, Thomas', 'Mhuircheartaigh, Jennifer Ni', 'Swords, Ronan', 'Murray, Margaret', ""O'Sullivan, Gerard J"", ""O'Keeffe, David""]","['Cronin CG', 'Cashell T', 'Mhuircheartaigh JN', 'Swords R', 'Murray M', ""O'Sullivan GJ"", ""O'Keeffe D""]","['Department of Radiology, University College Hospital, Galway, Ireland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,AJR Am J Roentgenol,AJR.

We sought to determine the safety and describe the toxicity of this approach by adding the mTOR inhibitor, sirolimus (rapamycin), to intensive AML induction chemotherapy. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We performed a phase I dose escalation study of sirolimus with the chemotherapy regimen MEC (mitoxantrone, etoposide, and cytarabine) in patients with relapsed, refractory, or untreated secondary AML. RESULTS: Twenty-nine subjects received sirolimus and MEC across five dose levels. Dose-limiting toxicities were irreversible marrow aplasia and multiorgan failure. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of sirolimus was determined to be a 12 mg loading dose on day 1 followed by 4 mg/d on days 2 to 7, concurrent with MEC chemotherapy. Complete or partial remissions occurred in 6 (22%) of the 27 subjects who completed chemotherapy, including 3 (25%) of the 12 subjects treated at the MTD. At the MTD, measured rapamycin trough levels were within the therapeutic range for solid organ transplantation. However, direct measurement of the mTOR target p70 S6 kinase phosphorylation in marrow blasts from these subjects only showed definite target inhibition in one of five evaluable samples. CONCLUSIONS: Sirolimus and MEC is an active and feasible regimen. However, as administered in this study, the synergy between MEC and sirolimus was not confirmed. Future studies are planned with different schedules to clarify the clinical and biochemical effects of sirolimus in AML and to determine whether target inhibition predicts chemotherapy response.","['Perl, Alexander E', 'Kasner, Margaret T', 'Tsai, Donald E', 'Vogl, Dan T', 'Loren, Alison W', 'Schuster, Stephen J', 'Porter, David L', 'Stadtmauer, Edward A', 'Goldstein, Steven C', 'Frey, Noelle V', 'Nasta, Sunita D', 'Hexner, Elizabeth O', 'Dierov, Jamil K', 'Swider, Cezary R', 'Bagg, Adam', 'Gewirtz, Alan M', 'Carroll, Martin', 'Luger, Selina M']","['Perl AE', 'Kasner MT', 'Tsai DE', 'Vogl DT', 'Loren AW', 'Schuster SJ', 'Porter DL', 'Stadtmauer EA', 'Goldstein SC', 'Frey NV', 'Nasta SD', 'Hexner EO', 'Dierov JK', 'Swider CR', 'Bagg A', 'Gewirtz AM', 'Carroll M', 'Luger SM']","['Hematologic Malignancies Program, Abramson Cancer Center, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA. alexander.perl@uphs.upenn.edu']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091020,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,,2009/10/22 06:00,2009/12/30 06:00,['2009/10/22 06:00'],"['2009/10/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/30 06:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-09-0842 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-09-0842 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2009 Nov 1;15(21):6732-9. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-09-0842.

METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 90 cycles of AML consolidation given to 30 patients between July 2003 and July 2007. RESULTS: Median age was 8 years (range 1.5-15) and 22/30 (73.3%) were males. Sixty-nine of 90 (76.7%) cycles were given on an ambulatory basis; readmission occurred in 25/69 (36.2%) and there was one death. The outpatient cycles in comparison to the inpatient cycles required significantly fewer invasive blood investigations (p<0.001) but had comparable number of blood products administered as supportive therapy. There was no significant difference in the frequency of granulocyte colony stimulating factor usage and recovery time of absolute neutrophil count and platelet count. The incidence of febrile neutropenia though was comparable in the groups (72.5% outpatient versus 76.2% inpatient), but the duration (p=0.003) and subsequent therapeutic antifungal usage (p=0.001) was significantly more in inpatient administered cycles. Second line antibiotics were needed in 16/50 (32%) outpatient episodes of febrile neutropenia in contrast to 10/16 (72.5%) episodes of febrile neutropenia in inpatient courses (p=0.030). CONCLUSIONS: Outpatient AML consolidation therapy is safe and feasible in children. It appears to result in less frequent invasive blood studies; shorter duration of febrile neutropenia and consequently less antimicrobial and antifungal usage as compared to inpatient consolidation cycles.

Purine analogs and monoclonal antibodies have enabled the shift from purely palliative treatment to intensive regimens aiming at complete remissions and possible prolongation of survival. Many patients have now been shown to achieve molecular responses in addition to their hematological remission. Despite this success, virtually all patients with CLL will eventually relapse and will become refractory to treatment. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation offers a chance of definite cure but is feasible in a minority of patients only. Therefore, considerable effort has been devoted to the further development of more conventional CLL management that is applicable to patient population generally affected by the disease. Emerging treatment concepts include novel combination of well-know agents such as rituximab and chlorambucil, fludarabine, cyclophosphamide and alemtuzumab, FCR with mitoxantrone amongst many. Consolidation regimens using mainly alemtuzumab are also increasingly used but are associated with a major increase in severe infections. High-dose steroids in combination with rituximab or alemtuzumab represent a promising option for refractory patients. Modern chemoimmunotherapy with the FCR regimen has also been tested in early stage patients with unfavourable prognostic factors. Finally, a there are a wide variety of novel drugs including bendamustine, a unique cytostatic with combined properties of an alkylating agent and purine analog, the monoclonal antibodies anti-CD20 ofatumumab and the anti-CD23 lumiliximab, thalidomide and its analog lenalidomide, the semi-synthetic flavonoid flavopiridol and other agents which are currently undergoing clinical trials with promising results.

STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We have analyzed the mH alloreactivity (enzyme-linked immunospot [ELISpot] for interferon-gamma[IFN-gamma] assay) from 24 donor/recipient pairs over a period of 2 years of follow-up and correlated such alloreactivity with the development of GVHD or absence of relapse. Circulating specific T cells anti-mH with multimer HLA-peptides were also studied. RESULTS: We show by ELISpot IFN-gamma assay that alloreactivity during the first 3 months from donor versus recipient or donor versus mismatched identified mH antigens is associated with acute GVHD and GVL effect. In addition, we demonstrate that the donor-versus-recipient reactivity observed after the third month is highly associated with chronic GVHD and GVL (p = 0.0007). Finally, we show by multimer HLA-peptide assay that mH epitope-specific T cells present after 3 months are statistically related to the GVL effect.

Nevertheless, the only physiological agent that to date has been shown to regulate transcription of this gene in mammalian cells is all-trans retinoic acid. Here we describe the identification of a retinoic acid response element that was located in the most distal of several alternative first exons of the human EVI1 gene and was constitutively bound by canonical retinoid receptors in NTERA-2 teratocarcinoma cells. Furthermore, it was the target of negative feedback by EVI1 on the induction of its own promoter by retinoic acid. This process required a previously described transcription repression domain of EVI1. Extending its role as a modulator of the retinoic acid response, EVI1 had the opposite effect on the RARbeta retinoic acid response element, whose induction by all-trans retinoic acid it enhanced through a mechanism that involved almost all of its known functional domains. Augmentation of the retinoic acid response by EVI1 was also observed for the endogenous RARbeta gene. Thus, we have established EVI1 as a novel type of modulator of the retinoic acid response, which can both enhance and repress induction by this agent in a promoter-specific manner.","['Bingemann, Sonja C', 'Konrad, Torsten A', 'Wieser, Rotraud']","['Bingemann SC', 'Konrad TA', 'Wieser R']","['Department of Medical Genetics, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091016,England,FEBS J,The FEBS journal,101229646,PMC2779989,2009/10/22 06:00,2010/02/19 06:00,['2009/10/22 06:00'],"['2009/10/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/19 06:00 [medline]']","['EJB7398 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1742-4658.2009.07398.x [doi]']",ppublish,FEBS J. 2009 Nov;276(22):6810-22. doi: 10.1111/j.1742-4658.2009.07398.x.

BCR-ABL is inhibited by imatinib; however, several mechanisms of imatinib resistance have been proposed that account for loss of imatinib efficacy in patients with CML. Previously, we showed that overexpression of the efflux drug transporter P-glycoprotein partially contributed to imatinib resistance in imatinib-resistant K562 CML cells having no BCR-ABL mutations. To explain an additional mechanism of drug resistance, we established a subclone (K562/R) of the cells and examined the BCR-ABL signaling pathway in these and wild-type K562 (K562/W) cells. We found the K562/R cells were 15 times more resistant to imatinib than their wild-type counterparts. In both cell lines, BCR-ABL and its downstream signaling molecules, such as ERK1/2, ERK5, STAT5, and AKT, were phosphorylated in the absence of imatinib. In both cell lines, imatinib effectively reduced the phosphorylation of all the above, except ERK1/2, whose phosphorylation was, interestingly, only inhibited in the wild-type cells. We then observed that phospho-ERK1/2 levels decreased in the presence of siRNA targeting BCR-ABL, again, only in the K562/W cells. However, using an ERK1/2 inhibitor, U0126, we found that we could reduce phospho-ERK1/2 levels in K562/R cells and restore their sensitivity to imatinib. Taken together, we conclude that the BCR-ABL-independent activation of ERK1/2 contributes to imatinib resistance in K562/R cells, and that ERK1/2 could be a target for the treatment of CML patients whose imatinib resistance is due to this mechanism.","['Nambu, Takeru', 'Araki, Norie', 'Nakagawa, Aiko', 'Kuniyasu, Akihiko', 'Kawaguchi, Tatsuya', 'Hamada, Akinobu', 'Saito, Hideyuki']","['Nambu T', 'Araki N', 'Nakagawa A', 'Kuniyasu A', 'Kawaguchi T', 'Hamada A', 'Saito H']","['Department of Pharmacy, Kumamoto University Hospital, Kumamoto, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090914,England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,,2009/10/22 06:00,2010/03/31 06:00,['2009/10/22 06:00'],"['2009/10/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/31 06:00 [medline]']","['CAS1365 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1349-7006.2009.01365.x [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2010 Jan;101(1):137-42. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.2009.01365.x.

Numerous studies suggest that the intracellular concentrations of the ara-C active metabolite, ara-CTP, vary widely among patients and, in turn, are associated with variability in clinical response to acute myeloid leukemia treatment. Thus, genetic variation in key genes in the ara-C metabolic pathway--specifically, deoxycytidine kinase (a rate-limiting activating enzyme), 5 nucleotidase, cytidine deaminase and deoxycytidylate deaminase (all three are inactivating enzymes), human equilibrative nucleoside transporter (ara-C uptake transporter) and ribonucleotide reductase (RRM1 and RRM2--enzymes regulating intracellular deoxycytidine triphosphate pools)--form the molecular basis of the interpatient variability observed in intracellular ara-CTP concentrations and response to ara-C. Understanding genetic variants in the key candidate genes involved in the metabolic activation of ara-C, as well as the pharmacodynamic targets of ara-C, will provide an opportunity to identify patients at an increased risk of adverse reactions or decreased likelihood of response, based upon their genetic profile, which in future could help in dose optimization to reduce drug toxicity without compromising efficacy. The pharmacogenetic studies on ara-C would also be equally applicable to other nucleoside analogs, such as gemcitabine, decitabine, clofarabine and so on, which are metabolized by the same pathway.","['Lamba, Jatinder K']",['Lamba JK'],"['Department of Experimental and Clinical Pharmacology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA. lamba004@umn.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",,England,Pharmacogenomics,Pharmacogenomics,100897350,PMC2828057,2009/10/22 06:00,2010/04/17 06:00,['2009/10/22 06:00'],"['2009/10/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.2217/pgs.09.118 [doi]'],ppublish,Pharmacogenomics. 2009 Oct;10(10):1657-74. doi: 10.2217/pgs.09.118.,10,IM,"[""5'-Nucleotidase/genetics"", 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*therapeutic use', 'Arabinofuranosylcytosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Cytarabine/*therapeutic use', 'Cytidine Deaminase/genetics', 'Deoxycytidine Kinase/genetics', 'Equilibrative Nucleoside Transporter 1/genetics', 'Forecasting', 'Genetic Variation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Nucleoside Deaminases/genetics', 'Pharmacogenetics/methods', 'Ribonucleotide Reductases/genetics']",109,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Equilibrative Nucleoside Transporter 1)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '13191-15-6 (Arabinofuranosylcytosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 1.17.4.- (Ribonucleotide Reductases)', 'EC 2.7.1.74 (Deoxycytidine Kinase)', ""EC 3.1.3.5 (5'-Nucleotidase)"", 'EC 3.5.4.- (Nucleoside Deaminases)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (Cytidine Deaminase)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (deoxycytidine deaminase)']",,,"['R01 CA132946/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA132946-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA132946-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA132946/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,['NIHMS171785'],,,,,,,,,,

Protein crystal structures of the bound Pim-1 complexes of benzothienopyrimidinones 3b (PDB code 3JYA), 6e (PDB code 3JYO), and 12b (PDB code 3JXW) were determined and used to guide SAR studies. Multiple compounds exhibited potent antiproliferative activity in K562 and MV4-11 cells with submicromolar EC(50) values. For example, compound 14j inhibited the growth of K562 cells with an EC(50) value of 1.7 muM and showed K(i) values of 2, 3, and 0.5 nM against Pim-1, Pim-2, and Pim-3, respectively. These novel Pim kinase inhibitors efficiently interrupted the phosphorylation of Bad in both K562 and LnCaP-Bad cell lines, indicating that their potent biological activities are mechanism-based. The pharmacokinetics of 14j was studied in CD-1 mice and shown to exhibit bioavailability of 76% after oral dosing.

The main objective of our study was to provide data on 89 patients who used a 5% imiquimod cream for the treatment of cutaneous tumors at the Cutaneous Oncology Group of the Dermatology Department of Hospital das Clinicas from 2003 to 2008. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Here, we present our experience in the treatment of 123 cutaneous tumors of various types, including basal cell carcinoma (BCC), squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), Bowen's disease, erythroplasia of Queyrat, Paget's disease, and trichoepithelioma, with 5% imiquimod cream from 2003 to 2008 in the Cutaneous Oncology Group of the Dermatology Department of Hospital das Clinicas. Patients were divided into two separate groups according to their diagnosis and comorbidities; these comorbidities included epidermodysplasia verruciformis, xeroderma pigmentosum, albinism, basal cell nevus syndrome, Brooke-Spiegler syndrome, HIV, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, B-cell lymphoma, and kidney transplantation. Treatment duration, response to imiquimod, follow-up, recurrence, and local and systemic reactions associated with use of the drug were analyzed. Epidemiological data were obtained and cure rates were calculated. RESULTS: The ratio of women to men was 1.28:1, and the mean age was 63.1 years. Tumors were located mainly on the face, back, trunk, and legs. For patients with comorbidities, the overall cure rate was 38%. These specific patients demonstrated cure rates of 83.5% for superficial BCC and 50% for Bowen's disease. Aggressive BCC and superficial and nodular BCC did not present a good response to treatment. Trichoepitheliomas and nodular BCC showed a partial response, and erythroplasia of Queyrat showed a complete response. For patients without comorbidities, the overall cure rate was 73%. For these patients, the cure rates were 85.7% for superficial and nodular BCC, 88% for superficial BCC, 57% for Bowen's disease, 50% for nodular BCC, and 50% for aggressive BCC. One SCC lesion demonstrated a complete response, and tumors caused by Paget's disease and erythroplasia of Queyrat presented a partial response. None of the tumors considered as clinically cured recurred. Thirty-seven lesions demonstrated no response to imiquimod. Having a cutaneous comorbidity, high-risk tumors such as mixed aggressive BCC (sclerodermiform or micronodular), nodular BCC, or Bowen's disease, and presenting no local reaction to imiquimod were considered as risk factors for a worse prognosis. We demonstrate that patients with no response to imiquimod, even when they demonstrated no local reaction, can undergo another cycle of six weeks of imiquimod treatment and show a complete response. The healing pattern led to good cosmetic outcomes, and the side effects were tolerable. CONCLUSIONS: Our experience confirms imiquimod as an effective treatment option for several types of cutaneous tumors, especially in patients without the cutaneous comorbidities cited above and with low-risk tumors. Imiquimod has a relatively low cost compared to other therapeutic options and can be delivered via ambulatory care to patients with surgery contraindications, and its side effects are tolerable.","['Alessi, Sabrina Sisto', 'Sanches, Jose Antonio', 'Oliveira, Walmar Roncalli de', 'Messina, Maria Cristina', 'Pimentel, Eugenio Raul de Almeida', 'Festa Neto, Cyro']","['Alessi SS', 'Sanches JA', 'Oliveira WR', 'Messina MC', 'Pimentel ER', 'Festa Neto C']","['Dermatology Department, Hospital das Clinicas da Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Brazil,Clinics (Sao Paulo),"Clinics (Sao Paulo, Brazil)",101244734,PMC2763070,2009/10/21 06:00,2010/06/24 06:00,['2009/10/21 06:00'],"['2009/05/21 00:00 [received]', '2009/07/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/10/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/24 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1590/S1807-59322009001000005 [doi]', 'S1807-59322009001000005 [pii]']",ppublish,Clinics (Sao Paulo). 2009;64(10):961-6. doi: 10.1590/S1807-59322009001000005.,10,IM,"['Adjuvants, Immunologic/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Administration, Topical', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Aminoquinolines/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Brazil/epidemiology', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Imiquimod', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Skin Neoplasms/classification/*drug therapy/epidemiology', 'Young Adult']",,"['0 (Adjuvants, Immunologic)', '0 (Aminoquinolines)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'P1QW714R7M (Imiquimod)']",,,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Basal cell carcinoma', 'Imiquimod', 'Immunomodulator', 'Immunotherapy', 'Non-melanoma skin cancer']",,,,,,,

Its diverse ATP site makes PIM2 a promising target for the development of anticancer agents. To date our knowledge of catalytic domain structures of the PIM kinase family is limited to PIM1 which has been extensively studied and which shares about 50% sequence identity with PIM2. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here we determined the crystal structure of PIM2 in complex with an organoruthenium complex (inhibition in sub-nanomolar level). Due to its extraordinary shape complementarity this stable organometallic compound is a highly potent inhibitor of PIM kinases. SIGNIFICANCE: The structure of PIM2 revealed several differences to PIM1 which may be explored further to generate isoform selective inhibitors. It has also demonstrated how an organometallic inhibitor can be adapted to the binding site of protein kinases to generate highly potent inhibitors.

We therefore performed a feasibility study to evaluate the safety of letrozole plus bevacizumab in patients with hormone receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC). METHODS: Patients with locally advanced breast cancer or MBC were treated with the aromatase inhibitor (AI) letrozole (2.5 mg orally daily) and the anti-VEGF antibody bevacizumab (15 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks). The primary end point was safety, defined by grade 4 toxicity using the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria, version 3.0. Secondary end points included response rate, clinical benefit rate, and progression-free survival (PFS). Prior nonsteroidal AIs (NSAIs) were permitted in the absence of progressive disease. RESULTS: Forty-three patients were treated. After a median of 13 cycles (range, 1 to 71 cycles), select treatment-related toxicities included hypertension (58%; grades 2 and 3 in 19% and 26%), proteinuria (67%; grades 2 and 3 in 14% and 19%), headache (51%; grades 2 and 3 in 16% and 7%), fatigue (74%; grades 2 and 3 in 19% and 2%), and joint pain (63%; grades 2 and 3 in 19% and 0%). Eighty-four percent of patients had at least stable disease on an NSAI, confounding efficacy results. Partial responses were seen in 9% of patients and stable disease >or= 24 weeks was noted in 67%. Median PFS was 17.1 months. CONCLUSION: Combination letrozole and bevacizumab was feasible with expected bevacizumab-related events of hypertension, headache, and proteinuria.

The Therapeutic Advances in Childhood Leukemia (TACL) Consortium was assembled to assess novel drugs for children with resistant leukemia. We hypothesize that novel agents and combinations that fail to improve baseline complete remission rates in comparable populations are unlikely to contribute to better outcomes and should be abandoned. We sought to define response rates and disease-free survival (DFS) rates in patients treated at TACL institutions, which could serve as a comparator for future studies. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort review of patients with relapsed and refractory ALL previously treated at TACL institutions between the years of 1995 and 2004. Data regarding initial and relapsed disease characteristics, disease response, and survival were collected and compared with those of published reports. RESULTS: Complete remission (CR) rates (mean +/- SE) were 83% +/- 4% for early first marrow relapse, 93% +/- 3% for late first marrow relapse, 44% +/- 5% for second marrow relapse, and 27% +/- 6% for third marrow relapse. Five-year DFS rates in CR2 and CR3 were 27% +/- 4% and 15% +/- 7% respectively. CONCLUSION: We generally confirm a 40% CR rate for second and subsequent relapse, but our remission rate for early first relapse seems better than that reported in the literature (83% v approximately 70%). Our data may allow useful modeling of an expected remission rate for any population of patients who experience relapse.","['Ko, Richard H', 'Ji, Lingyun', 'Barnette, Phillip', 'Bostrom, Bruce', 'Hutchinson, Raymond', 'Raetz, Elizabeth', 'Seibel, Nita L', 'Twist, Clare J', 'Eckroth, Elena', 'Sposto, Richard', 'Gaynon, Paul S', 'Loh, Mignon L']","['Ko RH', 'Ji L', 'Barnette P', 'Bostrom B', 'Hutchinson R', 'Raetz E', 'Seibel NL', 'Twist CJ', 'Eckroth E', 'Sposto R', 'Gaynon PS', 'Loh ML']","['Therapeutic Advances in Childhood Leukemia Consortium, Institute for Pediatric Clinical Research and Childrens Center for Cancer and Blood Diseases, University of Southern California-Childrens Hospital Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091019,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,PMC2815999,2009/10/21 06:00,2010/02/19 06:00,['2009/10/21 06:00'],"['2009/10/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/19 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2009.22.2950 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2009.22.2950 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2010 Feb 1;28(4):648-54. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2009.22.2950.

Here we describe a new mechanism of activation of MYB in human cancer involving gene fusion. We show that the t(6;9)(q22-23;p23-24) translocation in adenoid cystic carcinomas (ACC) of the breast and head and neck consistently results in fusions encoding chimeric transcripts predominantly consisting of MYB exon 14 linked to the last coding exon(s) of NFIB. The minimal common part of MYB deleted as the result of fusion was exon 15 including the 3'-UTR, which contains several highly conserved target sites for miR-15a/16 and miR-150 microRNAs. These microRNAs recently were shown to regulate MYB expression negatively. We suggest that deletion of these target sites may disrupt repression of MYB leading to overexpression of MYB-NFIB transcripts and protein and to activation of critical MYB targets, including genes associated with apoptosis, cell cycle control, cell growth/angiogenesis, and cell adhesion. Forced overexpression of miR-15a/16 and miR-150 in primary fusion-positive ACC cells did not significantly alter the expression of MYB as compared with leukemic cells with MYB activation/duplication. Our data indicate that the MYB-NFIB fusion is a hallmark of ACC and that deregulation of the expression of MYB and its target genes is a key oncogenic event in the pathogenesis of ACC. Our findings also suggest that the gain-of-function activity resulting from the MYB-NFIB fusion is a candidate therapeutic target.","['Persson, Marta', 'Andren, Ywonne', 'Mark, Joachim', 'Horlings, Hugo M', 'Persson, Fredrik', 'Stenman, Goran']","['Persson M', 'Andren Y', 'Mark J', 'Horlings HM', 'Persson F', 'Stenman G']","['Department of Pathology, Lundberg Laboratory for Cancer Research, the Sahlgrenska Academy at University of Gothenburg, SE-413 45 Gothenburg, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091019,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,PMC2773970,2009/10/21 06:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/10/21 06:00'],"['2009/10/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['0909114106 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.0909114106 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2009 Nov 3;106(44):18740-4. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0909114106.

In addition to ineffective hematopoiesis, we observed that NHD13 mice were lymphopenic; the lymphopenia was due to a decrease in both T and B lymphocytes. Although the pro-B cell (B220(+)/CD43(+)) populations from the NHD13 and wild-type mice were similar, the NHD13 mice showed decreased pre-B cells (B220(+)/CD43(-)), indicating impaired differentiation at the pro-B to pre-B stage. Thymi from NHD13 mice were smaller and overexpressed Hoxa cluster genes, including Hoxa7, Hoxa9, and Hoxa10. In addition, the NHD13 thymi contained fewer thymocytes, with an increased percentage of CD4(-)/CD8(-) (double-negative (DN)) cells and a decreased percentage of CD4(+)/CD8(+) (double-positive) cells; the DN1/DN2 population was increased and the DN3/DN4 population was decreased, suggesting a partial block at the DN2 to DN3 transition. To determine clonality of the thymocytes, we used degenerate RT-PCR to identify clonal Tcrb gene rearrangements. Five of six NHD13 thymi showed an unusual Tcrb gene rearrangement pattern with common, clonal DJ rearrangements, but distinct V-D junctions, suggesting a marked clonal expansion of thymocytes that had undergone a DJ rearrangement, but not completed a VDJ rearrangement. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that expression of the NHD13 transgene inhibits lymphoid as well as myeloid and erythroid differentiation, results in overexpression of Hoxa cluster genes, and leads to a precursor T cell lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma.","['Choi, Chul Won', 'Chung, Yang Jo', 'Slape, Christopher', 'Aplan, Peter D']","['Choi CW', 'Chung YJ', 'Slape C', 'Aplan PD']","['Genetics Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20889-5105, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",20091019,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,PMC3422874,2009/10/21 06:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/10/21 06:00'],"['2009/10/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['jimmunol.0901121 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.0901121 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2009 Nov 15;183(10):6227-35. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.0901121.

However, detailed underlying mechanisms leading to neutrophil apoptosis resistance are largely unknown, and possible therapeutic options to overcome this resistance do not exist. Here we report that activated neutrophils from severely injured patients exhibit cell death resistance due to impaired activation of the intrinsic apoptosis pathway, as evidenced by limited staurosporine-induced mitochondrial membrane depolarization and decreased caspase-9 activity. Moreover, we found that these neutrophils express high levels of antiapoptotic Mcl-1 and low levels of proapoptotic Bax protein. Mcl-1 up-regulation was dependent on elevated concentrations of GM-CSF in patient serum. Accordingly, increased Mcl-1 protein stability and GM-CSF serum concentrations were shown to correlate with staurosporine-induced apoptosis resistance. However, cross-linking of neutrophil Fas by immobilized agonistic anti-Fas IgM resulted in caspase-dependent mitochondrial membrane depolarization and apoptosis induction. In conclusion, the observed impairment of the intrinsic pathway and the resulting apoptosis resistance may be overcome by immobilized agonistic anti-Fas IgM. Targeting of neutrophil Fas by immobilized agonistic effector molecules may represent a new therapeutic tool to limit neutrophil hyperactivation and its sequelae in patients with severe immune disorders.","['Paunel-Gorgulu, Adnana', 'Zornig, Martin', 'Logters, Tim', 'Altrichter, Jens', 'Rabenhorst, Uta', 'Cinatl, Jindrich', 'Windolf, Joachim', 'Scholz, Martin']","['Paunel-Gorgulu A', 'Zornig M', 'Logters T', 'Altrichter J', 'Rabenhorst U', 'Cinatl J', 'Windolf J', 'Scholz M']","['Department of Traumatology and Hand Surgery, Heinrich-Heine University, Duesseldorf, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091019,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,,2009/10/21 06:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/10/21 06:00'],"['2009/10/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['jimmunol.0901264 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.0901264 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2009 Nov 15;183(10):6198-206. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.0901264.

In the United States, APL in children constitutes only 5% to 10% of AML. Molecularly, the disease is characterized by a fusion protein, promyelocytic leukemia (PML)-retinoic acid receptor (RAR)-alpha that results from a balanced reciprocal translocation between the PML gene on chromosome 15 and the RAR-alpha (RARA) gene on chromosome 17. A major advance in the field of APL treatment has been the use of all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA). Advances in the treatment of APL have taken this form of AML from a disease with significant morbidity and mortality to one with an excellent outcome. This has resulted largely from the incorporation of ATRA into frontline regimens with chemotherapy. Anthracyclines remain a cornerstone of treatment at this point.

The incidence and risk factors have been shown to vary in different series. In this study we want to establish the incidence of RAS in our hospital and try to elucidate factors that increase its risk. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 102 patients diagnosed with APL between August 1993 and December 2007 at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taiwan. All patients received ATRA as an induction regimen with or without conventional chemotherapy. RESULTS: Eight of the 102 patients (7.8%) experienced RAS which developed after a median of 9 days (range: 2 to 23 days) of ATRA treatment. Respiratory distress and fever were the most common presentations, occurring in 7 of 8 patients (87.5%). Age, gender, morphological or molecular subtypes, an initial white blood cell (WBC) count of more than 10 x 10(9)/L and concurrent chemotherapy did not statistically attribute to the occurrence of RAS. One patient developed RAS manifesting with pulmonary hemorrhage but experienced a complete recovery after administration of high-dose dexamethasone. The RAS-related mortality was 12.5% (1 out of 8 patients). CONCLUSION: The incidence of RAS in this study was similar to those of other series with ATRA and concurrent chemotherapy. Age, gender, morphological or molecular subtypes, an initial leukocyte count of more than 10 x 10(9)/L or the presence of concurrent chemotherapy is not significantly associated with the occurrence of the RAS.","['Su, Yung-Cheng', 'Dunn, Po', 'Shih, Lee-Yung', 'Kuo, Ming-Chung', 'Chang, Hung', 'Wu, Jin-Hou', 'Lin, Tung-Liang', 'Wang, Po-Nan', 'Tang, Tzung-Chih', 'Hung, Yu-Shin']","['Su YC', 'Dunn P', 'Shih LY', 'Kuo MC', 'Chang H', 'Wu JH', 'Lin TL', 'Wang PN', 'Tang TC', 'Hung YS']","['Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taipei, Chang Gung University College of Medicine, Taoyuan, Taiwan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,China (Republic : 1949- ),Chang Gung Med J,Chang Gung medical journal,101088034,,2009/10/21 06:00,2010/01/08 06:00,['2009/10/21 06:00'],"['2009/10/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/08 06:00 [medline]']",['3205/320508 [pii]'],ppublish,Chang Gung Med J. 2009 Sep-Oct;32(5):535-42.,5,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Syndrome', 'Tretinoin/*adverse effects']",,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study was purposed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of combination chemotherapy composing of cyclophosphamide (Cy), cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C) and topotecan (CAT regimen) for 37 refractory or relapsed AML patients. The dosing regimen was as follows: Cy 300 mg/m2 by intravenous infusion, every 12 hours on days 1-3, topotecan 1.25 mg/m2 by intravenous continuous infusion over 6 hours daily on days 2 to 6, Ara-C 500 mg/m2 by intravenous infusion over 2 hours daily for 5 days on days 2-6. The results showed that all patients completed one cycle of chemotherapy. 12 patients (32.4%) achieved complete remission (CR), 2 (5.4%) achieved partial remission (PR), and the 23 remaining patients achieved no remission (NR). The overall response rate (RR) was 37.8%. Among 18 relapsed cases, 6 cases had CR (33.3%), 2 cases achieved PR (11.1%), and 10 cases were with NR (55.6%). Among 19 refractory cases, 6 had CR (31.6%), and 13 (68.4%) were with NR. There was no statistically significant difference in RR between refractory and relapsed groups (31.6% and 44.4%, respectively) (p=0.42). Myelosuppression was universal. Mild non-hematologic toxicities were mainly gastrointestinal, as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea. The incidence of severe (grade III-IV) non-hematologic toxicity, such as oral mucositis and infection was 37.8% and 86.5% respectively. Only one patient died of severe infection during the observation (within 28 days from start of chemotherapy). The time of median follow-up was 4 (0-33) months, the median overall survival (OS) was 4 (1.8-6.2) months.

The patients were divided into groups A and B. 29 patients in group A underwent hiBM+PBSCT at 7th and 8th days of mobilization in donors with G-CSF respectively; 96 patients in group B underwent hiBMT. All patients received the same GVHD prophylaxis regimen, the clinical outcomes were investigated. The results showed that all patients except one CML-myelofibrosis patient achieved trilineage engraftment. Engraftment median times were 15 and 19 days for neutrophil and platelet in group A respectively, while engraftment median times were 18 and 23 days for neutrophil and platelet in group B respectively. The incidences of grade II-IV aGVHD were 31.03% in group A and 12.5% in group B respectively (p<0.05). The incidences of grade III-IV aGVHD was 13.79% and 10.41% in group A and group B (p>0.05). The aGVHD-related death incidence was 3.45% and 5.21% in group A and group B (p>0.05). The incidence of grade II-IV cGVHD was 48.2% and 35.4% in group A and group B respectively (p>0.05).

The expression of CD137 on normal T lymphocytes treated with phytohemagglutinin (PHA) was detected by FACS and indirect immunofluorescence. In HL-60 and T lymphocyte system in vitro, the effect of hCD137mAb and PHA on T lymphocyte proliferation was tested by MTT colorimetric assay.

The ADM accumulation and the protein levels of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) were detected by flow cytometry. The mRNA levels of P-gp were determined by RT-PCR. The in vivo effect of BrTet and Tet was investigated by using nude mice grafted with sensitive human leukemia cell line K562 and MDR cell line K562/A02. The results showed that BrTet at 0.25, 0.5 and 1 micromol/L reversed the resistance to ADM in MDR K562/A02 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Flow cytometry suggested that BrTet significantly increased the intracellular accumulation of ADM in K562/A02 cells in a dose-dependent manner. BrTet also inhibited the overexpression of P-gp in K562/A02 cells, and down-regulated mdr1 expression. In nude mice bearing K562 xenografts on the left flank and K562/A02 xenografts on the right flank, intraperitoneal injection of 10 mg/kg BrTet significantly enhanced the antitumor activity of ADM against K562/A02 xenografts with inhibitory rates of 26.1%, while ADM alone inhibited the growth of K562/A02 xenografts only by 5.8%. No enhancement effect by BrTet was seen in K562 xenografts. It is concluded that BrTet shows significant MDR reversal activity in vitro and in vivo. Its activity may be related to the inhibition of P-gp overexpression and the increase intracellular accumulation of anticancer drugs. BrTet may be a promising-MDR modulator for eventual assessment in the clinic.","['Cheng, Jian', 'Wang, Jue-Qiong', 'Chen, Bao-An', 'Gao, Feng', 'Xu, Wen-Lin', 'Shen, Hui-Lin', 'Ding, Jia-Hua', 'Gao, Chong', 'Sun, Yun-Yu', 'Wang, Jun', 'Zhao, Gang', 'Song, Hui-Hui', 'Bao, Wen', 'Sun, Qian', 'Dai, Yong-Yuan', 'Sun, Xin-Chen', 'Cheng, Hong-Yan', 'Deng, Yu-Xia', 'Li, Guo-Hong', 'Chen, Ning-Na', 'Liu, Li-Jie', 'Wang, Xue-Mei']","['Cheng J', 'Wang JQ', 'Chen BA', 'Gao F', 'Xu WL', 'Shen HL', 'Ding JH', 'Gao C', 'Sun YY', 'Wang J', 'Zhao G', 'Song HH', 'Bao W', 'Sun Q', 'Dai YY', 'Sun XC', 'Cheng HY', 'Deng YX', 'Li GH', 'Chen NN', 'Liu LJ', 'Wang XM']","['Department of Hematology, Zhongda Hospital, Clinical Medical School, Southeast University, Nanjing 210009, Jiangsu Province, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,,2009/10/21 06:00,2011/09/09 06:00,['2009/10/21 06:00'],"['2009/10/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/09 06:00 [medline]']",['1009-2137(2009)05-1183-09 [pii]'],ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2009 Oct;17(5):1183-91.,5,IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B', 'ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Benzylisoquinolines/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/*drug effects/genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects/genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,"['0 (ABCB1 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Benzylisoquinolines)', '0 (bromotetrandrine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Immunophenotyping of 192 patients was performed by flow cytometry using a panel of monoclonal antibodies. The karyotypes in 125 out of 192 cases were analyzed by G-banding technology. The results showed that CD33, CD13, myeloperoxidase (MPO) and CD117 were the most commonly expressed antigens in AML. CD117 expressed in 84.6% of AML-M3 cases. A combination of intensive autofluorescence, both CD34- and HLA-DR-, and high expression of CD13, CD33 and MPO had significant value for AML-M3 diagnosis. CD14 expressed only in AML-M4 and AML-M5, and both intensive positivity of CD64 and CD15 with high expression of HLA-DR may suggest great possibility for diagnosis of AML-M5. Lymphoid marker expression was documented in 47.9% of the 192 AML cases. CD56 (26.0%) and CD7 (20.8%) were the most commonly expressed lymphoid markers in AML patients, followed by CD19 (9.9%) and CD2 (7.3%). Abnormal karyotypes were detected in 76 out of 125 cases (60.8%). Correlation test showed that t(8;21) was found only in 17 cases of AML-M2 and strongly associated with the individual or combinational expressions of CD15/CD19/CD56. And 28 cases of t(15;17) were found in AML-M3; 2 cases of inv(16) were found in AML-M4EO. Higher CD34 positivity was found in LymAg+ group (77.2%) than that in LymAg- group (48.0%). It is concluded that immunophenotype analysis is useful for AML diagnosis and classification, and the immunophenotype has close relevance to the abnormal cytogenetic changes and clinical features in AML. The results suggested that a new prognostic scoring system that integrated the morphology, cytogenetic abnormalities and immunophenotype parameters would benefit the diagnosis, classification, and estimation of prognosis in AML patients.","['Tong, Hai-Xia', 'Wang, Hui-Han', 'Zhang, Ji-Hong', 'Liu, Zhuo-Gang', 'Zheng, Ying-Chun', 'Wang, Yun-Xiu']","['Tong HX', 'Wang HH', 'Zhang JH', 'Liu ZG', 'Zheng YC', 'Wang YX']","['Laboratory of Hematology, Department of Hematology, Shengjing Hospital, China Medical University, Shenyang 110022, Liaoning Province, China. tonghaixia18@yahoo.com.cn']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,,2009/10/21 06:00,2011/09/09 06:00,['2009/10/21 06:00'],"['2009/10/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/09 06:00 [medline]']",['1009-2137(2009)05-1174-05 [pii]'],ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2009 Oct;17(5):1174-8.,5,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytogenetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/*genetics/*immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Young Adult']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The expression levels of psma6-encoding protein P27K was assayed by using immunohistochemistry method. The results showed that the expression levels of psma6 mRNA in AML-M5 leukemia cells was lower than that in non AML-M5 leukemia cells, non-leukemia cells and normal blood cells.

The effect of zo-1 siRNA was monitored by RT-PCR. The cellular proliferation activity was assayed by CCK-8, the apoptosis was detected by Annexin-V-fluorescence in isothiocyanate (FITC) assay, and cell cycle was observed by propidium iodide (PI). The results indicated that the gene zo-1 in patients with acute leukemia was hypermethylated, while the gene zo-1 in healthy persons was unmethylated. The THP-1 cells with unmethylation of zo-1 gene promoter overexpressed the gene zo-1, while the Molt4 and HL-60 cells with hypermethylation of gene zo-1 promoter did not express the gene zo-1. The silenced zo-1 gene in Molt4 and HL-60 leukemia cell lines could be reactivated by demethylation treatment with 5-AZA-dC. The oligofectamine-transfected siRNA for zo-1 gene successfully inhibited the expression of gene zo-1 in THP-1 cells, but did not interfere with cell proliferation, cell cycle and apoptosis. It is concluded that gene zo-1 is a leukemia-related gene. Gene zo-1 in acute leukemia was hypermethylated, the methylation status of gene zo-1 regulates the expression of gene zo-1.

The WBC and bone marrow blast counts in FLT3-ITD positive patients seemed both higher than those in patients with wild-type FLT3 (FLT3-wt), but there was significant difference only in WBC count (p<0.05). The complete remission (CR) rate in FLT3-ITD positive patients was 47.6%, which was significantly lower than that in FLT3-wt patients (88.1%, p<0.05). There was no statistical difference in CR rate between FLT3-ITD positive and negative patients in 20 cases of M3; the CR rate in FLT3-ITD positive patients with non M(3) was 37.5 (6/16) which was obviously lower than that in FLT3-wt patients with non M3 (90.6%, 48/53) (p<0.05). 3 FLT3-ITD positive patients with CR relapsed after CR for 14 (2-20) months with relapse rate 50% (3/6) which was higher than that in FLT3-wt patients (29.2%, 14/48). It is concluded that FLT3 mutation is common in AML patients, while FLT3-ITD mutation is more frequent than FLT3-TKD mutation. The AML patients with FLT3-ITD mutation have a poor prognosis, while FLT3-TKD point mutation does not significantly influences prognosis of the patients. Therefore early detection of FLT3 mutation may be important for targeting therapy and evaluating clinical prognosis of AML patients.","['Han, Yang-Li', 'Zhang, Su-Jiang', 'Qiao, Chun', 'Dai, Dan', 'Sun, Xue-Mei', 'Xu, Yan-Li', 'Qian, Si-Xuan', 'Xu, Wei', 'Wang, Ji-Shi', 'Li, Jian-Yong']","['Han YL', 'Zhang SJ', 'Qiao C', 'Dai D', 'Sun XM', 'Xu YL', 'Qian SX', 'Xu W', 'Wang JS', 'Li JY']","['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing 210029, Jiangsu Province, China.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,,2009/10/21 06:00,2011/09/09 06:00,['2009/10/21 06:00'],"['2009/10/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/09 06:00 [medline]']",['1009-2137(2009)05-1135-05 [pii]'],ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2009 Oct;17(5):1135-9.,5,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Young Adult', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*genetics']",,"['EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Due to their extremely poor cellular uptake, C3 transferases were supposed to be exoenzymes rather than exotoxins, challenging their role in pathogenesis. Here, we report for the first time that low concentrations of both C3lim and C3bot are selectively internalized into macrophages/monocytes in less than 3 h, inducing the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton by ADP-ribosylation of Rho. We demonstrate that C3 transferases are internalized into the cytosol of macrophages/monocytes via acidified early endosomes. Bafilomycin A1, an inhibitor of endosomal acidification, protected J774A.1 macrophages and human promyelotic leukaemia cells (HL-60) from intoxication by C3. Moreover, confocal laser scanning microscopy revealed colocalization of C3 with early endosomes. An extracellular acidic pulse enabled direct translocation of cell surface-bound C3 across the cytoplasmic membrane to the cytosol. In line with this finding, both C3 proteins exhibited membrane activity in lipid bilayer membranes only under acidic conditions (pH < 5.5). In conclusion, we identified macrophages/monocytes as target cells for clostridial C3 transferases and shed light on their selective uptake mechanism, which might contribute to understand the role of C3 transferases in pathogenesis.","['Fahrer, Jorg', 'Kuban, Jasmin', 'Heine, Karin', 'Rupps, Gabriel', 'Kaiser, Eva', 'Felder, Edward', 'Benz, Roland', 'Barth, Holger']","['Fahrer J', 'Kuban J', 'Heine K', 'Rupps G', 'Kaiser E', 'Felder E', 'Benz R', 'Barth H']","['Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Ulm Medical Center, Albert-Einstein-Allee 11, Ulm, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091013,England,Cell Microbiol,Cellular microbiology,100883691,,2009/10/21 06:00,2010/03/05 06:00,['2009/10/21 06:00'],"['2009/10/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/05 06:00 [medline]']","['CMI1393 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1462-5822.2009.01393.x [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Microbiol. 2010 Feb;12(2):233-47. doi: 10.1111/j.1462-5822.2009.01393.x.

Treatment of neoplasms in this area is mainly surgical and leads to a smaller or larger disability with a disorder of basic physiological functions such as breathing, swallowing and speech. It leads as well to the creation of psychological symptoms such as anxiety, depression. Lack of available data in Polish literature as well as in foreign literature on the subject of psychological state and quality of life of those patients, convinced me to start research in this area. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The research was conducted on a group of 131 patients aged 44-82 years. The patients were divided into three groups: group I consisted of patients after surgical procedures in the face area, group II of patients with serious prognosis (leukaemia) and group III of healthy patients. All patients were subject to survey, which consisted of 2 parts. First part contained 7 questions and related to patient's knowledge as to prognosis for further life (this part pertained patients from group I and II). Second part of the questionnaire was a shortened version of a depression scale based on 15 traits and short version based on 4 traits. It was adopted, that this is a good research tool in case of depression, since it is directed exclusively on diagnosis of depression symptoms. Short research technique facilitates the patient to answer questions asked. The results were interpreted according to depression rating scale. RESULTS: The research indicated that amongst patients after surgical procedures; over 50% of women and almost 40% of man showed intensified growth of depression. This percentage was significantly lower in the group of patients with serious prognosis. In the healthy group, all of the women and over 80% of men had no depression. Education statistically had no significant influence on the depression level. CONCLUSION: It can be ascertained that surgical procedures in the facial area and oral cavity have influence and generate patient's depression. Therefore, the care over those patients should be multispecialistic.","['Fraczak, Piotr']",['Fraczak P'],['Niepubliczny Zaklad Opieki Zdrowotnej Med i Dent s.c.

Tretinoin reversed the coagulopathy and normalised her blood counts without causing cytotoxic damage associated with cancer chemotherapy. Fetal distress occurred at 37 weeks of gestation and an emergency caesarean section was performed without complications and no blood transfusion support was needed as her coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia had resolved. A remission was achieved with only tretinoin induction. She subsequently had consolidation and maintenance chemotherapy. The mother and baby remain well at 4 years from completion of chemotherapy.

A meta-analysis with the results of previous studies of folic acid supplementation was also conducted. We found weak evidence of a protective effect of maternal folate supplementation before pregnancy against risk of childhood ALL, but no evidence for a protective effect of its use during pregnancy. A meta-analysis including this and 2 other studies, but not the study that raised the hypothesis, also found little evidence that folate supplementation during pregnancy protects against ALL: the summary odds ratios (ORs) for folate supplementation were 1.06 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.77-1.48] with reference to no folate supplementation and 1.02 (95% CI: 0.86-1.20) with reference to no vitamin supplementation. For vitamin supplementation in general, the summary OR from a meta-analysis of 5 studies-including Aus-ALL-was 0.83 (95% CI: 0.73-0.94). Vitamin supplementation in pregnancy may protect against childhood ALL, but this effect is unlikely to be large or, if real, specifically due to folate.","['Milne, Elizabeth', 'Royle, Jill A', 'Miller, Margaret', 'Bower, Carol', 'de Klerk, Nicholas H', 'Bailey, Helen D', 'van Bockxmeer, Frank', 'Attia, John', 'Scott, Rodney J', 'Norris, Murray D', 'Haber, Michelle', 'Thompson, Judith R', 'Fritschi, Lin', 'Marshall, Glenn M', 'Armstrong, Bruce K']","['Milne E', 'Royle JA', 'Miller M', 'Bower C', 'de Klerk NH', 'Bailey HD', 'van Bockxmeer F', 'Attia J', 'Scott RJ', 'Norris MD', 'Haber M', 'Thompson JR', 'Fritschi L', 'Marshall GM', 'Armstrong BK']","['Telethon Institute for Child Health Research, Centre for Child Health Research, West Perth, Western Australia 6872, Australia. lizm@ichr.uwa.edu.au']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,,2009/10/20 06:00,2010/04/24 06:00,['2009/10/20 06:00'],"['2009/10/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ijc.24969 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2010 Jun 1;126(11):2690-9. doi: 10.1002/ijc.24969.,11,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Birth Order', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dietary Supplements/*adverse effects', 'Educational Status', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', '*Maternal-Fetal Exchange', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*epidemiology', 'Pregnancy', 'Risk Factors', 'Vitamins/*adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Western Australia/epidemiology']",,['0 (Vitamins)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We identified the P2RY8-CRLF2 fusion in 7% of individuals with B-progenitor ALL and 53% of individuals with ALL associated with Down syndrome. CRLF2 alteration was associated with activating JAK mutations, and expression of human P2RY8-CRLF2 together with mutated mouse Jak2 resulted in constitutive Jak-Stat activation and cytokine-independent growth of Ba/F3 cells overexpressing interleukin-7 receptor alpha.

It is unknown whether the expression of LDH-5 in tissue sections also has prognostic significance and whether it is related to the expression of the anti-apoptotic proteins, Bcl-2, Bcl-XL and Mcl-1, and endoplasmic reticulum stress protein glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78). Identification of an association between LDH-5 expression and anti-apoptotic proteins may have important therapeutic implications for melanoma patients. Sections from 159 pigmented lesions, including nevi and melanoma at different stages of progression were studied by immunohistochemistry. Correlation of LDH-5 expression with clinicopathological factors and with the expression of Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, Mcl-1 and GRP78 was examined. LDH-5 was detected at low levels in 6 of 10 compound nevi (60%) and 6 of 10 dysplastic nevi (60%). The percentage of positive cases was greater in thin (<or=1.0 mm) (74%) and thick primary melanoma (>1.0 mm) (95%) and in metastatic melanoma in the skin (100%) and lymph node (81%). The immunoreactive score was highly related to progression of melanoma (P<0.0001). LDH-5 expression was positively associated with increasing tumor thickness (P=0.02) and dermal tumor mitotic rate (P=0.02). LDH-5 above the median immunoreactive score was associated with reduced disease-free survival and overall survival (P<0.02). LDH-5 expression was negatively associated with Bcl-2 expression. In contrast, LDH-5 expression was strongly associated with Bcl-XL and Mcl-1 expression and also positively associated with GRP78 expression (P<0.0001). The low Bcl-2 expression in melanomas with high LDH-5 expression provides an explanation for the poor response of patients with high serum LDH levels to treatment with the Bcl-2 antisense drug 'Genasense'. The strong correlation of LDH-5 expression with Mcl-1 expression suggests that treatment strategies inhibiting the activity of Mcl-1 in melanoma patients should be investigated.","['Zhuang, Liqing', 'Scolyer, Richard A', 'Murali, Rajmohan', 'McCarthy, Stanley W', 'Zhang, Xu Dong', 'Thompson, John F', 'Hersey, Peter']","['Zhuang L', 'Scolyer RA', 'Murali R', 'McCarthy SW', 'Zhang XD', 'Thompson JF', 'Hersey P']","['Tissue Pathology and Diagnostic Oncology, Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Sydney, NSW, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091016,United States,Mod Pathol,"Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc",8806605,,2009/10/20 06:00,2010/03/04 06:00,['2009/10/20 06:00'],"['2009/10/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/04 06:00 [medline]']","['modpathol2009129 [pii]', '10.1038/modpathol.2009.129 [doi]']",ppublish,Mod Pathol. 2010 Jan;23(1):45-53. doi: 10.1038/modpathol.2009.129.

MDA-MB-231 cells are estrogen receptor-negative human breast cancer cells shown to be responsive to tetrac in terms of decreased cell proliferation. Here we describe actions initiated at the cell surface receptor by unmodified tetrac and nanoparticulate tetrac on a panel of survival pathway genes in estrogen receptor-negative human breast cancer (MDA-MB-231) cells. Nanoparticulate tetrac is excluded from the cell interior. Expression of apoptosis inhibitors XIAP (X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis) and MCL1 (myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1) was downregulated by nanoparticulate tetrac in these breast cancer cells whereas apoptosis-promoting CASP2 and BCL2L14 were upregulated by the nanoparticulate formulation. Unmodified tetrac affected only XIAP expression. Expression of the angiogenesis inhibitor thrombospondin 1 (THBS1) gene was increased by both formulations of tetrac, as was the expression of CBY1, a nuclear inhibitor of catenin activity. The majority of differentially regulated Ras-oncogene family members were downregulated by nanoparticulate tetrac. The latter downregulated expression of epidermal growth factor receptor gene and unmodified tetrac did not. Nanoparticulate tetrac has coherent anti-cancer actions on expression of differentially-regulated genes important to survival of MDA-MB-231 cells.","['Glinskii, Anna B', 'Glinsky, Gennadi V', 'Lin, Hung-Yun', 'Tang, Heng-Yuan', 'Sun, Mingzeng', 'Davis, Faith B', 'Luidens, Mary K', 'Mousa, Shaker A', 'Hercbergs, Aleck H', 'Davis, Paul J']","['Glinskii AB', 'Glinsky GV', 'Lin HY', 'Tang HY', 'Sun M', 'Davis FB', 'Luidens MK', 'Mousa SA', 'Hercbergs AH', 'Davis PJ']","['Ordway Research Institute, Albany College of Pharmacy, Albany, NY, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091101,United States,Cell Cycle,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,,2009/10/20 06:00,2010/02/02 06:00,['2009/10/20 06:00'],"['2009/10/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/02 06:00 [medline]']","['9963 [pii]', '10.4161/cc.8.21.9963 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Cycle. 2009 Nov 1;8(21):3562-70. doi: 10.4161/cc.8.21.9963.

To identify biomarkers predictive of imatinib failure, we performed gene expression array profiling of CD34(+) cells from 2 independent cohorts of imatinib-naive chronic-phase CML patients. The learning set consisted of retrospectively selected patients with a complete cytogenetic response or more than 65% Ph(+) metaphases within 12 months of imatinib therapy. Based on analysis of variance P less than .1 and fold difference 1.5 or more, we identified 885 probe sets with differential expression between responders and nonresponders, from which we extracted a 75-probe set minimal signature (classifier) that separated the 2 groups. On application to a prospectively accrued validation set, the classifier correctly predicted 88% of responders and 83% of nonresponders. Bioinformatics analysis and comparison with published studies revealed overlap of classifier genes with CML progression signatures and implicated beta-catenin in their regulation, suggesting that chronic-phase CML patients destined to fail imatinib have more advanced disease than evident by morphologic criteria.

Cytogenetic aberrations are considered major prognostic indicators for predicting the survival of CLL patients. Given the difficulties in obtaining abnormal metaphases in CLL, fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) with specific probes is generally used to detect the most frequent abnormalities. To determine the best strategy for identifying cytogenetic abnormalities, we compared results obtained by FISH analysis on peripheral blood mononuclear cells with those obtained by FISH after culture with mitogens. We studied 46 CLL patients selected from two different institutions. The most frequent structural aberrations leading to loss of genetic material were loss of the 13q14 region, in 32 cases (70%), and loss of TP53 in 11 cases (24%). Of the 46 cases patients, 10 patients (21.7%) had deletion of the ATM locus at 11q22 and 8 patients (17%) had trisomy 12. Results could be interpreted as discordant in four cases in which the abnormal clone was small and both values were around the threshold. FISH performed on stimulated cells detected the same frequency of abnormalities as FISH performed without culture. This equivalence between the two techniques allows performing both conventional cytogenetic and FISH analyses on the same sample.","['El-Taweel, Maha', 'Barin, Carole', 'Cymbalista, Florence', 'Eclache, Virginie']","['El-Taweel M', 'Barin C', 'Cymbalista F', 'Eclache V']","['Laboratory of Hematology and Cytogenetics, Hospital Avicenne, Bobigny Cedex, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,,2009/10/20 06:00,2009/11/13 06:00,['2009/10/20 06:00'],"['2009/01/26 00:00 [received]', '2009/04/24 00:00 [revised]', '2009/06/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/10/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/11/13 06:00 [medline]']","['S0165-4608(09)00295-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cancergencyto.2009.06.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 2009 Nov;195(1):37-42. doi: 10.1016/j.cancergencyto.2009.06.004.,1,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cells, Cultured', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosome Mapping/methods', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence/*methods', 'Karyotyping/methods', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/*genetics', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/ultrastructure', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The tumor suppressor protein p53, encoded by TP53, is a major regulator of genome surveillance. Among the natural sequence variants of TP53, rs1042522 (R72P) modifies the risk for solid tumors. To investigate its relevance in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) susceptibility, we genotyped 114 cases and 414 newborn controls from Wales (UK) for polymorphisms in TP53 (R72P), its negative regulator MDM2 (single-nucleotide polymorphism SNP309, rs2279744), and selected HLA complex genes whose products interact with TP53. TP53 R72P showed a risk association with gene dosage effect (P=0.002) resulting in a strong association of homozygous genotype (OR=2.9, 95% CI=1.5-5.6) and no sex effect. SNP309 did not show any association with primary susceptibility to childhood ALL, even after stratification by sex. However, females with SNP309 minor allele had earlier onset of childhood ALL (median age at diagnosis was 36 months in females, but 60 months in males; P=0.002). The HLA complex genes did not show any statistically significant interaction with R72P. We have therefore identified TP53 R72P as a possible risk modifier for childhood ALL and the association of MDM2 with age at onset with sex effect suggests prenatal hormonal programming of childhood ALL susceptibility.","['Do, Thuy N', 'Ucisik-Akkaya, Esma', 'Davis, Charronne F', 'Morrison, Brittany A', 'Dorak, M Tevfik']","['Do TN', 'Ucisik-Akkaya E', 'Davis CF', 'Morrison BA', 'Dorak MT']","['Genomic Immunoepidemiology Laboratory, HUMIGEN LLC, Institute for Genetic Immunology, Hamilton, NJ 08690-3303, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,,2009/10/20 06:00,2009/11/13 06:00,['2009/10/20 06:00'],"['2009/05/05 00:00 [received]', '2009/05/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/10/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/11/13 06:00 [medline]']","['S0165-4608(09)00288-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.cancergencyto.2009.05.009 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 2009 Nov;195(1):31-6. doi: 10.1016/j.cancergencyto.2009.05.009.,1,IM,"['Case-Control Studies', 'Disease Susceptibility', 'Female', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2/*genetics', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*genetics']",,"['0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (MDM2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most transplantation models have required conditioning in which the recipients were either irradiated or treated with chemotherapy prior to injection of human leukemia cells. In this study, we reported an undescribed model in which adult ALL cells were injected into unconditioned newborn nonobese diabetic severe combined immunodeficient mice via an intrahepatic route. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood were collected from patients with ALL at diagnosis or relapse. CD34(+) selected lymphoblasts or mononuclear cells were transplanted as mentioned previously. Cells were also transplanted into sublethally irradiated adult mice via intravenous route for comparison. Leukemia engraftment was enumerated from mouse BM 6 to 18 weeks after transplantation. Clonality of the engrafting cells was examined based on IGH rearrangement and fluorescent in situ hybridization. RESULTS: Five of 13 ALL samples engrafted into the recipient BM 6 to 18 weeks after transplantation. Engrafted cells recapitulated the immunophenotype and cytogenetic characteristics of the original samples. Engraftment in BM and peripheral blood was significantly correlated. Importantly, there was significant correlation of engraftment between this and the conventional adult nonobese diabetic severe combined immunodeficient mouse model involving irradiation. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrated that this unconditioned newborn mouse model could be used for enumeration of leukemia initiating cells in ALL and should be further evaluated.","['Cheung, Alice M S', 'Fung, Tsz-Kan', 'Fan, August K P', 'Wan, Thomas S K', 'Chow, Howard C H', 'Leung, Joseph C K', 'Chan, Loretta Y Y', 'Kwong, Yok-Lam', 'Liang, Raymond', 'Leung, Anskar Y H']","['Cheung AM', 'Fung TK', 'Fan AK', 'Wan TS', 'Chow HC', 'Leung JC', 'Chan LY', 'Kwong YL', 'Liang R', 'Leung AY']","['Department of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,,2009/10/20 06:00,2010/01/12 06:00,['2009/10/20 06:00'],"['2009/08/04 00:00 [received]', '2009/10/10 00:00 [revised]', '2009/10/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/10/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/12 06:00 [medline]']","['S0301-472X(09)00398-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2009.10.007 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2010 Jan;38(1):3-10. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2009.10.007.,1,IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Lineage', 'DNA Primers', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Middle Aged', '*Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*pathology', 'Spectral Karyotyping', 'Transplantation, Heterologous']",,['0 (DNA Primers)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has recently been demonstrated that IM also targets other cellular components. Considering the significant role of telomerase in malignant transformation, we studied the effect of IM on telomerase activity (TA) and regulation in BCR-ABL-positive and -negative cells, sensitive and resistant to IM. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Through combining telomeric repeat amplification protocol for detecting TA, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and Western blots for detecting RNA and protein levels of telomerase regulating proteins and fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis, we showed that IM targets telomerase and the signal transduction cascade upstream of it. RESULTS: IM significantly inhibited TA in BCR-ABL-positive and -negative cells and in chronic myeloid leukemia patients. TA inhibition was also observed in BCR-ABL positive cells resistant to IM at drug concentrations that did not lead to a reduction in BCR-ABL expression. In addition, a reduction in phosphorylated AKT and phosphorylated PDK-1 was also detected following IM incubation. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate an inhibitory effect of IM on TA and on the AKT/PDK pathway. Because this effect was observed in cell expressing the BCR-ABL protein as well as cells not expressing it, and in cells sensitive as well as resistant to IM, it is reasonable to assume that the inhibitory effect of IM on TA is not mediated through known IM targets. The results of this study show that cells resistant to IM with regard to its effect on BCR-ABL could still be sensitive to IM treatment regarding other cellular components.","['Mor-Tzuntz, Rahav', 'Uziel, Orit', 'Shpilberg, Ofer', 'Lahav, Judith', 'Raanani, Pia', 'Bakhanashvili, Mary', 'Rabizadeh, Esther', 'Zimra, Yael', 'Lahav, Meir', 'Granot, Galit']","['Mor-Tzuntz R', 'Uziel O', 'Shpilberg O', 'Lahav J', 'Raanani P', 'Bakhanashvili M', 'Rabizadeh E', 'Zimra Y', 'Lahav M', 'Granot G']","['Felsenstein Medical Research Center, Beilinson Hospital, Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Petah-Tikva, Israel.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,,2009/10/20 06:00,2010/01/12 06:00,['2009/10/20 06:00'],"['2009/02/02 00:00 [received]', '2009/09/10 00:00 [revised]', '2009/10/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/10/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/12 06:00 [medline]']","['S0301-472X(09)00396-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2009.10.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2010 Jan;38(1):27-37. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2009.10.005.,1,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Base Sequence', 'Benzamides', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'DNA Primers', '*Genes, abl', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/enzymology/*pathology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Telomerase/*antagonists & inhibitors']",,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Median follow-up of unchanged BCR-ABL transcript level was 12 months (range, 6 - 64). We tested this group of patient for BCR-ABL mutations to reveal resistance development and to evaluate the risk of disease progression. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Altogether, 134 samples of peripheral blood of these 32 patients were tested for mutation in BCR-ABL kinase domain. RESULTS: Mutation was detected by direct sequencing in 9 of 32 patients (28%). Loss of complete cytogenetic remission or 1 log rise of BCR-ABL was observed in five of nine patients at a median of 5 months (range, 4-17) since first detection of mutation. One patient with no mutation relapsed 12 months after the start of the BCR-ABL plateau. In 5 of 32 patients without mutation (16%), BCR-ABL level significantly decreased after the first plateau to levels that stayed unchanged for a median of 11 months (range, 7-28). CONCLUSION: We show here that the BCR-ABL constant levels >or=0.1% (BCR-ABL plateau) in imatinib-responding patients may indicate mutation analysis. This approach highly reduces the number of examinations for mutation in chronic myeloid leukemia responders and may present cost-effective alternative applicable in clinical practice.","['Polakova, Katerina Machova', 'Polivkova, Vaclava', 'Rulcova, Jana', 'Klamova, Hana', 'Jurcek, Tomas', 'Dvorakova, Dana', 'Zackova, Daniela', 'Pospisil, Zdenek', 'Mayer, Jiri', 'Moravcova, Jana']","['Polakova KM', 'Polivkova V', 'Rulcova J', 'Klamova H', 'Jurcek T', 'Dvorakova D', 'Zackova D', 'Pospisil Z', 'Mayer J', 'Moravcova J']","['Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, Department of Molecular Genetics, Prague, Czech Republic. katerina.machova@uhkt.cz']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,,2009/10/20 06:00,2010/01/12 06:00,['2009/10/20 06:00'],"['2009/08/13 00:00 [received]', '2009/10/08 00:00 [revised]', '2009/10/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/10/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/12 06:00 [medline]']","['S0301-472X(09)00394-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2009.10.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2010 Jan;38(1):20-6. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2009.10.003.,1,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', '*Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'RNA, Messenger/*genetics', 'Remission Induction', 'Reproducibility of Results']",,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The rationale for such therapy is the realization that, in general, oncogenes and tumour suppressor genes encode proteins that are mutated or dysregulated forms of key components in major regulatory pathways. However, while we have witnessed striking clinical effects in certain malignancies, as in the treatment of chronic myelogeneous leukemia, the results in many other cancers have been rather disappointing, and this has raised the question of whether major advances can realistically be expected by the use of signal-targeted therapies on a broad scale. Here we briefly review the cellular and molecular basis for treatment with pharmacological signal inhibitors and the clinical experience with their use in different malignancies. We also discuss general strategies to improve the treatment, including approaches to the problem of resistance development. Clinical results vary greatly, from little or no treatment success in some cancers to an increasing number of examples of very promising responses. Progress has primarily been achieved in those malignancies and subsets of patients where the underlying molecular mechanisms have been explored in detail and the targets have been well defined. In conclusion, it is likely that novel signal-directed approaches will lead to further important advances in cancer therapy, but this will require continued efforts to identify targets that are oncogenic determinants, and systematic work to select patients for more individualized therapies.","['Christoffersen, Thoralf', 'Guren, Tormod K', 'Spindler, Karen-Lise Garm', 'Dahl, Olav', 'Lonning, Per Eystein', 'Gjertsen, Bjorn Tore']","['Christoffersen T', 'Guren TK', 'Spindler KL', 'Dahl O', 'Lonning PE', 'Gjertsen BT']","['Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway. thoralf.christoffersen@medisin.uio.no']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20091018,Netherlands,Eur J Pharmacol,European journal of pharmacology,1254354,,2009/10/20 06:00,2010/01/26 06:00,['2009/10/20 06:00'],"['2009/08/27 00:00 [received]', '2009/09/30 00:00 [revised]', '2009/10/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/10/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/26 06:00 [medline]']","['S0014-2999(09)00897-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ejphar.2009.10.009 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Pharmacol. 2009 Dec 25;625(1-3):6-22. doi: 10.1016/j.ejphar.2009.10.009.

In this method, 2-amino-6-benzylthioinosine (2A6BT) was used as internal standard and ethyl acetate was used as organic solvent for the extraction of 6BT and internal standard from plasma samples. The extracted samples were separated on YMC ODS-AQ((R)) column (2.0mmx50mm), and the eluates from the column were monitored by the positive-electrospray-ionization tandem mass spectrometer (ESI(+)-MS/MS). Quantification of 6BT by internal calibration with 2A6BT was carried out using multiple-reaction-monitoring (MRM) mode. This method had a linear calibration range of 3.00-1.00x10(3)ng/mL with correlation coefficients of 1.00 and 0.999 in mouse and human plasma. The lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) was 3.00ng/mL in either mouse or human plasma. The method had recovery of 6BT of 82-87% from mouse plasma and 90-98% from human plasma. Both accuracy (as percent error) and precision (as coefficient of variation) of the method were <or=+/-15% within the calibration range.

Infection with HTLV-1 represents a prototypical model of virus-mediated oncogenesis by virtue of the viral transactivator Tax, a potent oncogenic protein that exerts pleiotropic effects through its ability to deregulate the transcription of various cellular genes and signal transduction pathways and inhibit DNA repair enzymes, which are critical for T-cell homeostasis and genetic stability (Matsuoka and Jeang(3)) (et Boxus Retrovirology 2009). However, the oncogenic potential of Tax remains a conundrum. Tax protein expression is undetectable using conventional methods in freshly harvested ATLL cells and in non-malignant infected CD4+ T cells (Furukawa et al.(4)) but is up regulated after only a few hours of culture in vitro (Hanon et al.(5)). These observations strongly suggest that a host-derived mechanism is able to either actively repress the transcription of viral proteins in vivo or refrain the emergence of Tax-expressing cells, which would have a growth advantage.

However, under certain circumstances, retinol treatment can cause free radical generation and induce oxidative stress. In this study, we investigated photocytotoxicity and photomutagenicity of retinol using L5178Y/Tk(+/-) mouse lymphoma cells concomitantly exposed to retinol and ultraviolet A (UVA) light. While the cells treated with retinol alone at the doses of 5 or 10microg/ml in the absence of light did not increase the mutant frequency (MF) in the Tk gene, the treatment of the cells with 1-4microg/ml retinol under UVA light (1.38mW/cm(2) for 30min) increased the MF in the Tk gene in a dose-responsive manner. To elucidate the underlying mechanism of action, we also examined the mutational types of the Tk mutants by determining their loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at four microsatellite loci spanning the entire chromosome 11 on which the Tk gene is located. The mutational spectrum for the retinol+UVA treatment was significantly different from those of the control and UVA alone. More than 93% of the mutants from retinol+UVA treatment lost heterozygosity at the Tk1 locus and the major type (58%) of mutations was LOHs extending to D11Mit42, an alternation involving approximately 6cM of the chromosome, whereas the main type of mutations in the control was non-LOH mutations. These results suggest that retinol is mutagenic when exposed to UVA in mouse lymphoma cells through a clastogenic mode-of-action.","['Mei, Nan', 'Hu, Jiaxiang', 'Xia, Qingsu', 'Fu, Peter P', 'Moore, Martha M', 'Chen, Tao']","['Mei N', 'Hu J', 'Xia Q', 'Fu PP', 'Moore MM', 'Chen T']","['Division of Genetic and Reproductive Toxicology, National Center for Toxicological Research, Jefferson, AR 72079, USA. nan.mei@fda.hhs.gov']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20091014,England,Toxicol In Vitro,Toxicology in vitro : an international journal published in association with BIBRA,8712158,PMC6359890,2009/10/20 06:00,2010/06/03 06:00,['2009/10/20 06:00'],"['2009/08/11 00:00 [received]', '2009/10/07 00:00 [revised]', '2009/10/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/10/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/03 06:00 [medline]']","['S0887-2333(09)00298-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.tiv.2009.10.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Toxicol In Vitro. 2010 Mar;24(2):439-44. doi: 10.1016/j.tiv.2009.10.004.

As benzene exposure has been associated with childhood leukaemia and other cancers, this study aimed to provide a quantitative risk assessment. To accomplish this, we used measured food consumption data from the Dortmund Nutritional and Anthropometric Longitudinally Designed (DONALD) study, along with survey data on benzene in different juice categories. The calculated exposures for infants between 3 and 12 months were low, with averages between 1 and 10 ng/kg bw/day, resulting in a margin of exposure above 100,000. The exposures were judged as unlikely to pose a health risk for infants. Nevertheless, carcinogenic contaminants should be reduced to levels as low as reasonably achievable. The focus should be set on improving the sterilization conditions.","['Lachenmeier, Dirk W', 'Kuballa, Thomas', 'Reusch, Helmut', 'Sproll, Constanze', 'Kersting, Mathilde', 'Alexy, Ute']","['Lachenmeier DW', 'Kuballa T', 'Reusch H', 'Sproll C', 'Kersting M', 'Alexy U']","['Chemisches und Veterinaruntersuchungsamt (CVUA) Karlsruhe, Weissenburger Str 3, D-76187 Karlsruhe, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20091014,England,Food Chem Toxicol,Food and chemical toxicology : an international journal published for the British Industrial Biological Research Association,8207483,,2009/10/20 06:00,2010/04/16 06:00,['2009/10/20 06:00'],"['2009/07/15 00:00 [received]', '2009/09/25 00:00 [revised]', '2009/10/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/10/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S0278-6915(09)00473-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.fct.2009.10.012 [doi]']",ppublish,Food Chem Toxicol. 2010 Jan;48(1):291-7. doi: 10.1016/j.fct.2009.10.012.

For patients surviving a period of time after diagnosis, conditional survival (CS) accounts for changing risk over time. This report provides information on how CS in cancer patients changes as a function of age at diagnosis. Using data from the US Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results database, we examined survival for patients diagnosed between 1973 and 2002. The average annual percent change (AAPC) in CS during the first 5 years after diagnosis was evaluated for the 14 most common cancers occurring in young adults, defined as 15- to 39-year-olds, and how they compared with cancers that are more common in older and younger patients. For all cancers, young adult patients had less CS improvement over time than younger or older patients, and this difference was most pronounced in those aged 20 to 29 years (45% below the mean). Eleven of the 14 most common cancers in 15- to 39-year-olds either had a lower CS improvement after diagnosis than either younger or older patients, or than just the older patients. Young adults with leukemia had the greatest improvement in CS over time. In conclusion, young adults with cancer have not enjoyed the same improvement in CS over time compared with other age groups. Explanations for this deficit include the biologic nature of the type of cancers in young adults and less effective therapies for patients in the age group. Regardless of the reasons, the deficit is yet another challenge faced by young adult patients that merits further study.","['Bleyer, Archie', 'Choi, Mehee', 'Fuller, C David', 'Thomas, Charles R Jr', 'Wang, Samuel J']","['Bleyer A', 'Choi M', 'Fuller CD', 'Thomas CR Jr', 'Wang SJ']","['St. Charles Medical Center, Bend, OR 97701, USA. ableyer@gmail.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Semin Oncol,Seminars in oncology,0420432,,2009/10/20 06:00,2009/12/23 06:00,['2009/10/20 06:00'],"['2009/10/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/23 06:00 [medline]']","['S0093-7754(09)00139-0 [pii]', '10.1053/j.seminoncol.2009.07.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Semin Oncol. 2009 Oct;36(5):460-7. doi: 10.1053/j.seminoncol.2009.07.004.,5,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*mortality', 'SEER Program', 'Survival Analysis', 'United States/epidemiology', 'Young Adult']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Three members of the NK-like subfamily of homeobox genes (NKLs), TLX1, TLX3 and NKX2-5, are implicated in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). They are activated by particular chromosomal aberrations. However, their precise function in leukemogenesis is still unclear. Here we screened further NKLs in 24 T-ALL cell lines and identified the common expression of MSX2. The subsequent aim of this study was to analyze the role of MSX2 in T-cell differentiation which may be disturbed by oncogenic NKLs. METHODS: Specific gene activity was examined by quantitative real-time PCR, and globally by expression profiling. Proteins were analyzed by western blot, immuno-cytology and immuno-precipitation. For overexpression studies cell lines were transduced by lentiviruses. RESULTS: Quantification of MSX2 mRNA in primary hematopoietic cells demonstrated higher levels in CD34+ stem cells as compared to peripheral blood cells and mature CD3+ T-cells. Furthermore, analysis of MSX2 expression levels in T-cell lines after treatment with core thymic factors confirmed their involvement in regulation. These results indicated that MSX2 represents an hematopoietic NKL family member which is downregulated during T-cell development and may functionally substituted by oncogenic NKLs. For functional analysis JURKAT cells were lentivirally transduced, overexpressing either MSX2 or oncogenic TLX1 and NKX2-5, respectively. These cells displayed transcriptional activation of NOTCH3-signaling, including NOTCH3 and HEY1 as analyzed by gene expression profiling and quantitative RT-PCR, and consistently attenuated sensitivity to gamma-secretase inhibitor as analyzed by MTT-assays. Furthermore, in addition to MSX2, both TLX1 and NKX2-5 proteins interacted with NOTCH-pathway repressors, SPEN/MINT/SHARP and TLE1/GRG1, representing a potential mechanism for (de)regulation. Finally, elevated expression of NOTCH3 and HEY1 was detected in primary TLX1/3 positive T-ALL cells corresponding to the cell line data. CONCLUSION: Identification and analysis of MSX2 in hematopoietic cells implicates a modulatory role via NOTCH3-signaling in early T-cell differentiation. Our data suggest that reduction of NOTCH3-signaling by physiological downregulation of MSX2 expression during T-cell development is abrogated by ectopic expression of oncogenic NKLs, substituting MSX2 function.","['Nagel, Stefan', 'Venturini, Letizia', 'Przybylski, Grzegorz K', 'Grabarczyk, Piotr', 'Meyer, Corinna', 'Kaufmann, Maren', 'Battmer, Karin', 'Schmidt, Christian A', 'Drexler, Hans G', 'Scherr, Michaela', 'Macleod, Roderick Af']","['Nagel S', 'Venturini L', 'Przybylski GK', 'Grabarczyk P', 'Meyer C', 'Kaufmann M', 'Battmer K', 'Schmidt CA', 'Drexler HG', 'Scherr M', 'Macleod RA']","['Dept. of Human and Animal Cell Lines, DSMZ - German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Inhoffenstr, 7B, 38124 Braunschweig, Germany. sna@dsmz.de']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20091019,England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,PMC2770077,2009/10/20 06:00,2010/01/14 06:00,['2009/10/20 06:00'],"['2009/05/12 00:00 [received]', '2009/10/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/10/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/14 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2407-9-371 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2407-9-371 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2009 Oct 19;9:371. doi: 10.1186/1471-2407-9-371.,,IM,"['Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/genetics/*metabolism/physiopathology', 'Receptor, Notch3', 'Receptors, Notch/genetics/*metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/metabolism']",,"['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (MSX2 protein)', '0 (NOTCH3 protein, human)', '0 (Receptor, Notch3)', '0 (Receptors, Notch)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Animal model systems show that MLL gain of function mutations may contribute to leukemogenesis. Wild-type (wt) MLL possesses histone methyltransferase activity and functions at the level of chromatin organization by affecting the expression of specific target genes. While numerous MLL fusion proteins exert a diverse array of functions, they ultimately serve to induce transcription of specific genes. Hence, acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALL) with MLL mutations (MLLmu) exhibit characteristic gene expression profiles including high-level expression of HOXA cluster genes. Here, we aimed to relate MLL mutational status and tumor suppressor gene (TSG) methylation/expression in acute leukemia cell lines. RESULTS: Using MS-MLPA (methylation-specific multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification assay), methylation of 24 different TSG was analyzed in 28 MLLmu and MLLwt acute leukemia cell lines. On average, 1.8/24 TSG were methylated in MLLmu AML cells, while 6.2/24 TSG were methylated in MLLwt AML cells. Hypomethylation and expression of the TSG BEX2, IGSF4 and TIMP3 turned out to be characteristic of MLLmu AML cell lines. MLLwt AML cell lines displayed hypermethylated TSG promoters resulting in transcriptional silencing. Demethylating agents and inhibitors of histone deacetylases restored expression of BEX2, IGSF4 and TIMP3, confirming epigenetic silencing of these genes in MLLwt cells. The positive correlation between MLL translocation, TSG hypomethylation and expression suggested that MLL fusion proteins were responsible for dysregulation of TSG expression in MLLmu cells. This concept was supported by our observation that Bex2 mRNA levels in MLL-ENL transgenic mouse cell lines required expression of the MLL fusion gene. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the conspicuous expression of the TSG BEX2, IGSF4 and TIMP3 in MLLmu AML cell lines is the consequence of altered epigenetic properties of MLL fusion proteins.","['Rohrs, Sonja', 'Dirks, Wilhelm G', 'Meyer, Claus', 'Marschalek, Rolf', 'Scherr, Michaela', 'Slany, Robert', 'Wallace, Andrew', 'Drexler, Hans G', 'Quentmeier, Hilmar']","['Rohrs S', 'Dirks WG', 'Meyer C', 'Marschalek R', 'Scherr M', 'Slany R', 'Wallace A', 'Drexler HG', 'Quentmeier H']","['DSMZ-German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Braunschweig, Germany. sro07@dsmz.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091016,England,Mol Cancer,Molecular cancer,101147698,PMC2770485,2009/10/20 06:00,2010/02/06 06:00,['2009/10/20 06:00'],"['2009/06/03 00:00 [received]', '2009/10/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/10/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/06 06:00 [medline]']","['1476-4598-8-86 [pii]', '10.1186/1476-4598-8-86 [doi]']",epublish,Mol Cancer. 2009 Oct 16;8:86. doi: 10.1186/1476-4598-8-86.,,IM,"['Azacitidine/pharmacology', 'Cell Adhesion Molecule-1', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Methylation/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/pharmacology', 'Immunoglobulins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/classification/*genetics', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/metabolism', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinase-3/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', '*Translocation, Genetic/drug effects', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics/*metabolism']",,"['0 (BEX2 protein, human)', '0 (CADM1 protein, human)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecule-1)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (Immunoglobulins)', '0 (MLL-ENL oncoprotein, human)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (TIMP3 protein, human)', '0 (Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinase-3)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (retinoic acid receptor beta)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', '3X2S926L3Z (trichostatin A)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This mutation impairs the function of the innate antiviral type I interferon pathway and is a known susceptibility factor for prostate cancer. Here, we attempt to measure the prevalence of XMRV in prostate cancer cases in Germany and determine whether an analogous association with the R462Q polymorphism exists. RESULTS: 589 prostate tumor samples were genotyped by real-time PCR with regard to the RNaseL mutation. DNA and RNA samples from these patients were screened for the presence of XMRV-specific gag sequences using a highly sensitive nested PCR and RT-PCR approach. Furthermore, 146 sera samples from prostate tumor patients were tested for XMRV Gag and Env antibodies using a newly developed ELISA assay. In agreement with earlier data, 12.9% (76 samples) were shown to be of the QQ genotype. However, XMRV specific sequences were detected at neither the DNA nor the RNA level. Consistent with this result, none of the sera analyzed from prostate cancer patients contained XMRV-specific antibodies. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate a much lower prevalence (or even complete absence) of XMRV in prostate tumor patients in Germany. One possible reason for this could be a geographically restricted incidence of XMRV infections.","['Hohn, Oliver', 'Krause, Hans', 'Barbarotto, Pia', 'Niederstadt, Lars', 'Beimforde, Nadine', 'Denner, Joachim', 'Miller, Kurt', 'Kurth, Reinhard', 'Bannert, Norbert']","['Hohn O', 'Krause H', 'Barbarotto P', 'Niederstadt L', 'Beimforde N', 'Denner J', 'Miller K', 'Kurth R', 'Bannert N']","['Robert Koch-Institute, Centre for Biological Safety 4, Nordufer 20, 13353 Berlin, Germany.

METHODS: The authors compared plasma methotrexate pharmacokinetics in pediatric patients with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia who received concomitant allopurinol (n = 20) versus those treated with nonrecombinant or recombinant urate oxidase (n = 96) during high-dose methotrexate administration before conventional remission induction therapy. RESULTS: The minimum plasma concentration of uric acid was significantly (P < .0001) lower after urate oxidase treatment than the concentration after allopurinol treatment. Methotrexate clearance was significantly higher (median, 117.1 mL/minute/m(2) vs 91.1 mL/minute/m(2); P = .019) in patients who received urate oxidase. A higher proportion of patients in the allopurinol group had elevated methotrexate plasma concentrations (36% vs 7%; P = .003) and experienced mucositis (45% vs 16%; P = .003) after methotrexate treatment compared with the urate oxidase group. CONCLUSIONS: The lower rate of methotrexate clearance in patients who received allopurinol likely reflected a less potent hypouricemic effect of allopurinol, leading to precipitation of uric acid in renal tubules. Hence, during remission induction therapy for lymphoid malignancies, the authors concluded that renally excreted drugs should be monitored closely, especially in patients who are receiving allopurinol.","['Crews, Kristine R', 'Zhou, Yinmei', 'Pauley, Jennifer L', 'Howard, Scott C', 'Jeha, Sima', 'Relling, Mary V', 'Pui, Ching-Hon']","['Crews KR', 'Zhou Y', 'Pauley JL', 'Howard SC', 'Jeha S', 'Relling MV', 'Pui CH']","[""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105-3678, USA. kristine.crews@stjude.org""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,PMC2846832,2009/10/17 06:00,2010/03/10 06:00,['2009/10/17 06:00'],"['2009/10/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.24681 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2010 Jan 1;116(1):227-32. doi: 10.1002/cncr.24681.,1,IM,"['Allopurinol/*pharmacology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hyperuricemia/prevention & control', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/blood/*pharmacokinetics/toxicity', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'Urate Oxidase/*pharmacology', 'Uric Acid/blood']",,"['268B43MJ25 (Uric Acid)', '63CZ7GJN5I (Allopurinol)', 'EC 1.7.3.3 (Urate Oxidase)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",['Copyright 2010 American Cancer Society.'],,"['R01 CA051001-15/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA023099-299002/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA23099/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA021765-31/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA051001/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA51001/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA32053/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA023099/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA031566-21/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA021765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA31566/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,['NIHMS149924'],,,,,,,,,,

From spots to in vitro assays using TOP15 charts.,5006-15,10.1002/pmic.200900335 [doi],"The resistance of malignant cells to chemotherapy calls for the development of novel anti-cancer drugs. TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) is a pro-apoptotic cytokine, which selectively induces apoptosis in malignant cells. We derived two TRAIL-resistant HL-60 subclones, HL-60/P1 and HL-60/P2, from a TRAIL-sensitive HL-60 acute promyelocytic leukemia cell line. To identify therapeutically exploitable ""weaknesses"" of the TRAIL-resistant leukemia cells that could be used as molecular targets for their elimination, we performed proteomic (2-DE) analysis and compared both TRAIL-resistant subclones with the original TRAIL-sensitive HL-60 cells. We identified over 40 differentially expressed proteins. To significantly narrow the lists of candidate proteins, we excluded proteins that are known to be often differentially expressed, regardless of experiment type and tissue (the so-called ""TOP15"" proteins). Decreased expression of DNA replication and maintenance proteins MCM7 and RPA32 in HL-60/P1 cells, and the marked down-regulation of enzyme adenosine deaminase in HL-60/P2 cells, suggests increased sensitivity of these cells to DNA-interfering drugs, and adenosine and its homologues, respectively. In a series of in vitro assays, we confirmed the increased toxicity of etoposide and cisplatin to TRAIL resistant HL-60/P1 cells, and adenosine and vidarabine to HL-60/P2, compared with TRAIL-sensitive HL-60 cells.","['Petrak, Jiri', 'Toman, Ondrej', 'Simonova, Tereza', 'Halada, Petr', 'Cmejla, Radek', 'Klener, Pavel', 'Zivny, Jan']","['Petrak J', 'Toman O', 'Simonova T', 'Halada P', 'Cmejla R', 'Klener P', 'Zivny J']","['Charles University in Prague, First Faculty of Medicine, Institute of Pathological Physiology, Prague, Czech Republic. jpetr@lf1.cuni.cz']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Germany,Proteomics,Proteomics,101092707,,2009/10/17 06:00,2010/02/23 06:00,['2009/10/17 06:00'],"['2009/10/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pmic.200900335 [doi]'],ppublish,Proteomics. 2009 Nov;9(22):5006-15. doi: 10.1002/pmic.200900335.,22,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Minichromosome Maintenance Complex Component 7', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Replication Protein A/metabolism', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/*pharmacology']",,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Replication Protein A)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', 'EC 2.7.7.7 (RPA2 protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.4.12 (MCM7 protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.4.12 (Minichromosome Maintenance Complex Component 7)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While arsenic is a known carcinogen, recent studies suggest that it is useful as a therapeutic agent for leukemia. This study examined the relationship between arsenic exposure and bladder cancer mortality. METHODS: We studied 832 cases of bladder cancer diagnosed in New Hampshire from a population-based case-control study. Individual exposure to arsenic was determined in home drinking water using ICP-MS and in toenail samples by instrumental neutron activation analysis. RESULTS: Among the high arsenic exposure group, found using toenail arsenic level or arsenic consumption, cases experienced a de-escalated survival hazard ratio (HR) [high (> or =75 percent) versus low (<25th percentile) toenail arsenic overall survival HR 0.5 (95% CI 0.4-0.8)], controlled for tumor stage, grade, gender, age and treatment regimen. This association was found largely among invasive tumors, in smokers and was not modified by TP53 status. Bladder cancer cause-specific survival showed a similar trend, but did not reach statistical significance [HR 0.5 (95% CI 0.3-1.1)]. CONCLUSIONS: Arsenic exposure may be related to the survival of patients with bladder cancer.","['Kwong, Ryan C', 'Karagas, Margaret R', 'Kelsey, Karl T', 'Mason, Rebecca A', 'Tanyos, Sam A', 'Schned, Alan R', 'Marsit, Carmen J', 'Andrew, Angeline S']","['Kwong RC', 'Karagas MR', 'Kelsey KT', 'Mason RA', 'Tanyos SA', 'Schned AR', 'Marsit CJ', 'Andrew AS']","['Section of Biostatistics and Epidemiology, Department of Community and Family Medicine, Norris Cotton Cancer Center, Dartmouth Medical School, 7927 Rubin 860 One Medical Center Drive, Lebanon, NH 03756, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20091016,Germany,World J Urol,World journal of urology,8307716,PMC3296964,2009/10/17 06:00,2010/11/05 06:00,['2009/10/17 06:00'],"['2009/02/12 00:00 [received]', '2009/09/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/10/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/11/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00345-009-0477-y [doi]'],ppublish,World J Urol. 2010 Aug;28(4):487-92. doi: 10.1007/s00345-009-0477-y.

However, it has not yet been established which of the patients in whom imatinib treatment fails are likely to benefit from therapy with second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors. DESIGN AND METHODS: We analyzed a cohort of 80 patients with chronic myeloid leukemia who were resistant to imatinib and who were treated with dasatinib or nilotinib while still in first chronic phase. We devised a scoring system to predict the probability of these patients achieving complete cytogenetic response when treated with second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors. RESULTS: The system was based on three factors: cytogenetic response to imatinib, Sokal score and recurrent neutropenia during imatinib treatment. We validated the score in an independent group of 28 Scottish patients. We also studied the relationship between cytogenetic responses at 3, 6 and 12 months and subsequent outcome. We classified the 80 patients into three categories, those with good risk (n=24), intermediate risk (n=27) and poor risk (n=29) with 2.5-year cumulative incidences of complete cytogenetic response of 100%, 52.2% and 13.8%, respectively (P<0.0001). Moreover, patients who had less than 95% Philadelphia chromosome-positive metaphases at 3 months, those with 35% or less Philadelphia chromosome-positive metaphases at 6 months and patients in complete cytogenetic response at 12 months all had significantly better outcomes than patients with lesser degrees of cytogenetic response. CONCLUSIONS: Factors measurable before starting treatment can accurately predict response to second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Cytogenetic responses at 3, 6 and 12 months may influence the decision to continue treatment with second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors.","['Milojkovic, Dragana', 'Nicholson, Emma', 'Apperley, Jane F', 'Holyoake, Tessa L', 'Shepherd, Pat', 'Drummond, Mark W', 'Szydlo, Richard', 'Bua, Marco', 'Foroni, Letizia', 'Reid, Alistair', 'Khorashad, Jamshid S', 'de Lavallade, Hugues', 'Rezvani, Katy', 'Paliompeis, Christos', 'Goldman, John M', 'Marin, David']","['Milojkovic D', 'Nicholson E', 'Apperley JF', 'Holyoake TL', 'Shepherd P', 'Drummond MW', 'Szydlo R', 'Bua M', 'Foroni L', 'Reid A', 'Khorashad JS', 'de Lavallade H', 'Rezvani K', 'Paliompeis C', 'Goldman JM', 'Marin D']","['Department of Haematology, Imperial College London, Du Cane Road, London W12 0NN, United Kingdom. d.marin@imperial.ac.uk.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091014,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,PMC2817024,2009/10/17 06:00,2010/05/14 06:00,['2009/10/17 06:00'],"['2009/10/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/14 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2009.012781 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2009.012781 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2010 Feb;95(2):224-31. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2009.012781.

Childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is said to have lower incidence in developing countries, which has implications for its pathogenesis, but there are few studies concerning the completeness of cancer registries in developing countries. This study analyzes the number of cases and incidence of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia in three different cities in Brazil and estimates underreporting cases and possible PBCR failures. METHODS: We evaluated the completeness of PBCR and the incidence rates of childhood ALL from three different Brazilian cities using the two-source capture-recapture method. The sources used were a population-based registry and databases from a diagnosis reference laboratory in 2001 and the Chapman's formula was used to calculate the estimates. RESULTS: The estimated incidence was 5.76, 6.32 and 5.48 per 100,000 inhabitants for Salvador, Recife and Belo Horizonte, respectively. The estimated completeness of childhood ALL in PBCRs was 15.5%, 35.4% and 29.2%, respectively, for Salvador, Recife and Belo Horizonte. CONCLUSIONS: There was a high estimated underreporting of childhood leukemia cases in some Brazilian cities. The relationship between information systems and the capture-recapture method application improved epidemiological estimates. Childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia incidence rates are similar to those of developed countries.","['Azevedo-Silva, Fernanda', 'Reis, Rejane de Souza', 'Santos, Marceli de Oliveira', 'Luiz, Ronir Raggio', 'Pombo-de-Oliveira, Maria S']","['Azevedo-Silva F', 'Reis Rde S', 'Santos Mde O', 'Luiz RR', 'Pombo-de-Oliveira MS']","['Instituto Nacional de Cancer, CEP, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. azevedosilva.fernanda@gmail.com']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091014,Netherlands,Cancer Epidemiol,Cancer epidemiology,101508793,,2009/10/17 06:00,2010/02/17 06:00,['2009/10/17 06:00'],"['2009/07/09 00:00 [received]', '2009/09/08 00:00 [revised]', '2009/09/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/10/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/17 06:00 [medline]']","['S1877-7821(09)00123-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.canep.2009.09.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Epidemiol. 2009 Dec;33(6):403-5. doi: 10.1016/j.canep.2009.09.004.

Because of their efficient inference and ability to represent causal relationships, they are an excellent choice for medical decision support systems in diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis. Although good procedures for learning Bayesian networks from data have been defined, their performance in learning from censored survival data has not been widely studied. In this paper, we explore how to use these procedures to learn about possible interactions between prognostic factors and their influence on the variate of interest. We study how censoring affects the probability of learning correct Bayesian network structures. Additionally, we analyse the potential usefulness of the learnt models for predicting the time-independent probability of an event of interest. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We analysed the influence of censoring with a simulation on synthetic data sampled from randomly generated Bayesian networks. We used two well-known methods for learning Bayesian networks from data: a constraint-based method and a score-based method. We compared the performance of each method under different levels of censoring to those of the naive Bayes classifier and the proportional hazards model. We did additional experiments on several datasets from real-world medical domains. The machine-learning methods treated censored cases in the data as event-free. RESULTS: We report and compare results for several commonly used model evaluation metrics. On average, the proportional hazards method outperformed other methods in most censoring setups. As part of the simulation study, we also analysed structural similarities of the learnt networks. Heavy censoring, as opposed to no censoring, produces up to a 5% surplus and up to 10% missing total arcs. It also produces up to 50% missing arcs that should originally be connected to the variate of interest. CONCLUSION: Presented methods for learning Bayesian networks from data can be used to learn from censored survival data in the presence of light censoring (up to 20%) by treating censored cases as event-free. Given intermediate or heavy censoring, the learnt models become tuned to the majority class and would thus require a different approach.","['Stajduhar, Ivan', 'Dalbelo-Basic, Bojana', 'Bogunovic, Nikola']","['Stajduhar I', 'Dalbelo-Basic B', 'Bogunovic N']","['Department of Automation, Electronics and Computing, Faculty of Engineering, University of Rijeka, Vukovarska 58, 51000 Rijeka, Croatia. ivan.stajduhar@riteh.hr']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091014,Netherlands,Artif Intell Med,Artificial intelligence in medicine,8915031,,2009/10/17 06:00,2010/01/15 06:00,['2009/10/17 06:00'],"['2008/06/19 00:00 [received]', '2009/01/12 00:00 [revised]', '2009/08/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/10/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/15 06:00 [medline]']","['S0933-3657(09)00132-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.artmed.2009.08.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Artif Intell Med. 2009 Nov;47(3):199-217. doi: 10.1016/j.artmed.2009.08.001.

Di, tri and tetrameric 9th-10th type III fibronectin domains (FIII9'10) were used to generate clustered integrin alpha5beta1 ligand surfaces for mES cell culture. Compared to gelatin, FIII9'10 (monomer), FIII9'10-trimer and -tetramer, the FIII9'10-dimer supported the highest number of mES cell colonies. No evidence of domain unfolding upon surface adsorption was found. Colonies appeared disperse with a spread cell morphology unless subdued back to a tight morphology with increasing concentrations of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). In the presence of LIF, mES cells adherent to the FIII9'10-dimer showed transient upregulation of Oct-4, the mesodermal transcription factor, Brachyury, and the ectodermal marker, Nestin. However, dual upregulation of Nanog maintained the mES cells in a pluripotent state, confirmed by alkaline phosphatase staining. Therefore, the behavior of mES cells adherent to dimeric integrin alpha5beta1 ligands is a largely morphological phenomenon conferring pro-differentiation signals towards mesodermal and ectodermal lineages. This work will be of interest to cell and tissue engineering groups aiming to control ES cell behavior through integrin ligand presentation and synthetic substrates.","['Singh, Mark D', 'Kreiner, Michaela', 'McKimmie, Clive S', 'Holt, Stephen', 'van der Walle, Christopher F', 'Graham, Gerard J']","['Singh MD', 'Kreiner M', 'McKimmie CS', 'Holt S', 'van der Walle CF', 'Graham GJ']","['Division of Immunology Infection and Inflammation, Glasgow Biomedical Research Centre, University of Glasgow, 120 University Place, Glasgow G12 8TA, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091013,United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,,2009/10/17 06:00,2009/12/30 06:00,['2009/10/17 06:00'],"['2009/10/02 00:00 [received]', '2009/10/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/10/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/30 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-291X(09)01999-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2009.10.035 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2009 Dec 18;390(3):716-21. doi: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2009.10.035.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to examine the effect of age on survival in CLL using an original method. METHODS: Clinical, laboratory and survival data of 87 CLL patients treated in our institute were analysed. The survival of patients in different age groups was determined and compared, as related to the expected survival of age- and gender-matched general population obtained from national statistical data. RESULTS: The mean age in the younger (< or = 65 years, n = 37) and older (> 65 years) age groups was 56 and 74 years (p < 0.001). The younger group had more unfavourable presentation, with advanced stage (Rai 2-4) in 46% vs. 16% (p = 0.002), and diffuse involvement of bone marrow in 60% vs. 18% (p = 0.03), compared with the older group, and were more likely to require treatment (p = 0.02). The Kaplan-Meyer curve showed a more favourable survival for the younger group. However, the loss of expected survival exposed a reversed pattern: while the older patients lost only 13%, the survival loss in the younger patients was 44% (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia had a more unfavourable presentation and a more severe clinical course in the younger patients. Our method of evaluating the negative impact of disease on expected survival reveals that their survival also is significantly more affected than that of older patients. We suggest calculating the loss of expected survival as a new criterion for assessing disease impact.","['Klepfish, A', 'Rachmilewitz, E A', 'Sarid, M', 'Schattner, A']","['Klepfish A', 'Rachmilewitz EA', 'Sarid M', 'Schattner A']","['Blood Bank and Hematology Institute, Wolfson Medical Center, Holon, Israel. amiMD@clalit.org.il']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article']",,England,Int J Clin Pract,International journal of clinical practice,9712381,,2009/10/17 06:00,2010/11/10 06:00,['2009/10/17 06:00'],"['2009/10/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/11/10 06:00 [medline]']","['IJCP2008 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1742-1241.2009.02008.x [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Clin Pract. 2009 Nov;63(11):1601-3. doi: 10.1111/j.1742-1241.2009.02008.x.,11,IM,"['*Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*mortality', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The evolution of Runx genes begins with one most like Runx3 in invertebrates, progresses to four genes in Drosophila, and to three in vertebrates. Runx genes have two promoters and various numbers of exons and isoforms. All three genes with expressions in the same biological tissues act either synergistically or at different time periods. Runx genes have downstream target genes. Furthermore, Runx genes are mediated by TGFbeta or BMP pathways. They also have cohesin-dependent regulation. Runx1 binds the CD4 silencer and represses transcription in immature double negative thymocytes. Runx1 also activates CD8 as the double negative population progresses to double positive thymocytes. Runx3 establishes epigenetic silencing in CD4 - CD8+ cytotoxic T-cells by binding the CD4 silencer core sequence. Runx1 may also be involved in CD4 silencing in CD8+ T-cells. RUNX1 mutations cause familial thrombocytopenia with a propensity for developing acute myelogenous leukemia; two functional consequences of these mutations include haploinsufficiency and a dominant negative effect. The latter tends to be associated with a higher frequency of leukemia. RUNX2 mutations cause cleidocranial dysplasia; most are of the missense type and commonly occur in the Runt domain. RUNX3 is a tumor suppressor gene with hemizygous deletion of one allele and hypermethylation of the other, resulting in gastric adenocarcinoma.","['Cohen, M Michael Jr']",['Cohen MM Jr'],"['Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Dalhousie University, 5981 University Avenue, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada B3H 1W2. mmichael.cohenjr@gmail.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Am J Med Genet A,American journal of medical genetics.

However, the question of whether sub-clinical signs of cardiomyopathy may develop and progress over time in children receiving doses of <350 mg/m(2) is controversial. The aim of the present study was to examine cardiac function with serial echocardiography from diagnosis to last follow-up, relapse, or death, and to investigate whether suspected risk factors (e.g., age at diagnosis, gender, cumulative dose, and length of follow-up) had a significant influence on cardiac function. PROCEDURE: An unselected cohort of 80 patients treated with multi-drug chemotherapy including anthracycline doses of 300 mg/m(2) or less for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia was followed with serial echocardiograms. The deviations of each echocardiogram from normal values for the same age and body-surface areas were calculated. The influences of risk factors were analyzed using univariate and multivariate regression. Lowess curves of time dependence were calculated. RESULTS: All echocardiographic parameters including ejection fraction (EF) deteriorated significantly over time. Male gender was significantly associated with systolic dilatation of the left ventricle and positively associated with left ventricular mass. Reduction of EF was significantly associated with age at diagnosis and male gender. CONCLUSIONS: Anthracycline doses of <300 mg/m(2) may contribute to a decline in cardiac function over time. Although the deterioration in cardiac parameters was not associated with clinical symptoms, life-long cardiac surveillance for these patients is important to establish the impact of low-dose anthracycline therapy on long-term cardiac health.","['Rathe, Mathias', 'Carlsen, Niels Lauritz Torp', 'Oxhoj, Henrik', 'Nielsen, Gunner']","['Rathe M', 'Carlsen NL', 'Oxhoj H', 'Nielsen G']","[""H.C.

Here we found that Gr-1 treatment of BM cells in vitro and in vivo showed no depleting effects. The epitope recognized by the Gr-1 Ab overlapped with Ly-6G (1A8 Ab) but not Ly-6C (ER-MP20 Ab). In vitro the Gr-1 Ab transmitted signals via STAT-1, STAT-3 and STAT-5 into BM cells, similar to GM-CSF. In healthy mice injected with the Gr-1 Ab, the Ab remained attached to the surface of myeloid cells for at least four days. Gr-1 Ab induced myeloid cell expansion, upregulation of macrophage markers, but not the DC marker CD11c. Suppressor activity of two distinct Gr-1(high) and Gr-1(low) expressing BM-myeloid-derived suppressor cell subsets was transiently ablated by Gr-1 Ab injection. Depleting effects of Gr-1 Ab could only be observed on inflammatory Ly-6C(int)Ly-6G(high) neutrophils from the peritoneal cavity, which occurred via apoptosis and was associated with the absence of Mcl-1 expression. Together, Gr-1 Ab induces signals leading to myelopoiesis and affects myeloid-derived suppressor cell activity, suggesting functional roles for Ly-6C/G molecules in macrophage differentiation and neutrophil apoptosis.","['Ribechini, Eliana', 'Leenen, Pieter J M', 'Lutz, Manfred B']","['Ribechini E', 'Leenen PJ', 'Lutz MB']","['Institute of Virology and Immunobiology, University of Wuerzburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Germany,Eur J Immunol,European journal of immunology,1273201,,2009/10/16 06:00,2010/01/07 06:00,['2009/10/16 06:00'],"['2009/10/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/eji.200939530 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Immunol. 2009 Dec;39(12):3538-51. doi: 10.1002/eji.200939530.,12,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Antigens, Ly/immunology/metabolism', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Macrophage-1 Antigen', 'Macrophages/cytology/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Models, Biological', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Myeloid Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Myelopoiesis/drug effects', 'Neutrophils/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Receptor, Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/metabolism', 'STAT Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects']",,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Ly)', '0 (Ly-6C antigen, mouse)', '0 (Ly6G antigen, mouse)', '0 (Macrophage-1 Antigen)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (STAT Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We retrospectively analyzed 382 febrile episodes encountered during induction and consolidation chemotherapy to determine the potential etiology, microbiologic spectrum, response/resistance to antibiotics and outcome. Between May, 2001 and December, 2006, 95 patients with de novo non-M3 AML received remission induction chemotherapy followed by consolidation in those who achieved complete remission. Patients median age was 28 years, ranging from 2 to 61 years, 26 patients were </=15 years of age. There were 57 males and 38 females. Febrile neutropenia was defined as per international guidelines. A total of 382 febrile episodes were recorded; neutropenic 347 (induction phase 172, consolidation phase 175) and non-neutropenic 35 (induction 16, consolidation 19). Clinical, microbiological and radiological evidence of infection could be identified in 64% of the febrile episodes (74% during induction, 52% during consolidation). Pulmonary infections were most common, both during induction and consolidation phase. Microbiologically gram-negative infections predominated. There were 60 possible/probable/definite episodes of fungal infection. Six cases of tuberculosis (pulmonary 5 and spine 1) and 3 cases of malaria (including one case of cerebral malaria) were also identified. Nineteen patients died (17 during induction, 2 during consolidation); 17 deaths were infection related, 12/17 possibly due to fungal infections. We suggest that evaluation of antibacterial resistance patterns in an institution must be done routinely in order to choose empiric antibiotics therapy. Careful selection of antibiotics and early institution of antifungal therapy besides considering alternative diagnosis peculiar to the region (e.g. tuberculosis, malaria) may help in reducing morbidity and mortality during AML therapy.","['Gupta, Ajay', 'Singh, Mansher', 'Singh, Harkirat', 'Kumar, Lalit', 'Sharma, Atul', 'Bakhshi, Sameer', 'Raina, Vinod', 'Thulkar, Sanjay']","['Gupta A', 'Singh M', 'Singh H', 'Kumar L', 'Sharma A', 'Bakhshi S', 'Raina V', 'Thulkar S']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Institute Rotary Cancer Hospital, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, 110029, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20091015,United States,Med Oncol,"Medical oncology (Northwood, London, England)",9435512,,2009/10/16 06:00,2011/04/09 06:00,['2009/10/16 06:00'],"['2009/05/24 00:00 [received]', '2009/09/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/10/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/04/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12032-009-9330-9 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Oncol. 2010 Dec;27(4):1037-45. doi: 10.1007/s12032-009-9330-9.

The inability to tolerate 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) at conventional doses was considered as a surrogate marker of hematologic toxicity. The allele frequency of TPMT*2, *3A, *3B and *3C in the study population was 0.5, 0, 0 and 2.6%, respectively, similar to the frequency observed in other Asian populations. Five patients were heterozygous for TPMT*3C variant allele, and one of these patient's was compound heterozygous with TPMT*2 variant as the other allele. The impact of TPMT polymorphisms on the toxicity and treatment outcome was assessed in 66 pediatric patients only, as there was no variant TPMT detected in the adult patients. Three of the 5 patients (60%) heterozygous for TPMT*2 or TPMT*3C polymorphisms and 12/61 patients (20%) with wild type TPMT genotype had more than 10% of reduction of 6-MP dose (P=0.07).

Many exogenous risk factors, such as cigarette smoke, dietary additives, chemical exposures, radiation, and biologic agents including viral infection, are involved in the methylation pathways of cancers. We propose a multidimensional selective item response regression model to describe and test how a risk factor may alter molecular pathways involving aberrant methylation of multiple genes in oncogenesis. Our modeling framework is built on an item response model for multivariate dichotomous responses of high dimension, such as aberrant methylation of multiple tumor-suppressor genes, but we allow risk factors such as SV40 viral infection to alter the distribution of the latent factors that subsequently affect the outcome of cancer. We postulate empirical identification conditions under our model formulation. Moreover, we do not prespecify the links between the multiple dichotomous methylation responses and the latent factors, but rather conduct specification searches with a genetic algorithm to discover the links. Parameter estimation through maximum likelihood and specification searches in models with multidimensional latent factors for multivariate binary responses have become practical only recently, due to modern statistical computing development. We illustrate our proposal with the biological finding that simultaneous methylation of multiple tumor-suppressor genes is associated with the presence of SV40 viral sequences and with the cancer status of lymphoma/leukemia.We are able to test whether the data are consistent with the causal hypothesis that SV40 induces aberrant methylation of multiple genes in its oncogenic pathways. At the same time, we are able to evaluate the role of SV40 in the methylation pathway and to determine whether the methylation pathway is responsible for the development of leukemia/lymphoma.","['Lin, Haiqun', 'Feng, Ziding', 'Yu, Yan', 'Zheng, Yingye', 'Shivapurkar, Narayan', 'Gazdar, Adi F']","['Lin H', 'Feng Z', 'Yu Y', 'Zheng Y', 'Shivapurkar N', 'Gazdar AF']","['Division of Biostatistics, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT 06520 ( haiqun.lin@yale.edu ).']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,J Am Stat Assoc,Journal of the American Statistical Association,01510020R,PMC2760744,2008/03/01 00:00,2008/03/01 00:01,['2009/10/16 06:00'],"['2009/10/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2008/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.1198/016214507000000428 [doi]'],ppublish,J Am Stat Assoc. 2008 Mar 1;103(481):201-211. doi: 10.1198/016214507000000428.,481,,,,,,,"['R01 MH066187/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 CA084971/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 CA084971-08/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 CA086368/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,['NIHMS137283'],,,,,,,,,,

Recently, a non-authorized product which claims comparability to imatinib has become available. CASE PRESENTATION: This report describes the loss of response in a 36-year-old male patient with chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukemia who had previously been in full hematologic and cytogenetic remission and partial molecular remission for three years, under treatment with brand-name imatinib of 400 mg per day. Before the initiation of treatment with a copy product, imatib (CIPLA-India), the patient had negative BCR-ABL status. Within three months of initiation of treatment with the copy product, the patient's BCR-ABL status became positive, with substantial decreases noted in white blood cell counts, red blood cell counts and platelet counts. Conversion of the BCR-ABL status to negative and improvements in hematologic parameters were achieved when the brand medication, imatinib, was resumed at a dose of 600 mg per day. CONCLUSION: In our patient, the substitution of a copy product for imatinib resulted in the rapid loss of a previously stable response, with the risk of progression to life-threatening accelerated phase or blast crisis phase of the disease. Without supportive clinical evidence of efficacy and safety of imatib (or any other copy product) caution should be used when substituting imatinib in the treatment of any patient with chronic myeloid leukemia.","['Goubran, Hadi Alphonse']",['Goubran HA'],"['Professor of Medicine and Clinical Haematology, Faculty of Medicine, Cairo University Maadi, 1431, Cairo Egypt.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20090429,England,J Med Case Rep,Journal of medical case reports,101293382,PMC2726486,2009/10/16 06:00,2009/10/16 06:01,['2009/10/16 06:00'],"['2008/11/24 00:00 [received]', '2009/01/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/10/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/16 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1186/1752-1947-3-7112 [doi]'],epublish,J Med Case Rep. 2009 Apr 29;3:7112. doi: 10.1186/1752-1947-3-7112.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This condition was successfully treated with periodic phlebotomy thus precluding discontinuation of imatinib. To our knowledge, this is the first report of hepatic hemosiderosis most likely consequent to imatinib therapy.","['Maiti, Baidehi', 'Setrakian, Sebouh', 'Daw, Hamed A']","['Maiti B', 'Setrakian S', 'Daw HA']","['Department of Internal Medicine, 18101 Lorain Avenue, Fairview Hospital, Cleveland, Ohio 44111, USA. bm_9999@yahoo.com']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],20090526,England,Cases J,Cases journal,101474272,PMC2740313,2009/10/16 06:00,2009/10/16 06:01,['2009/10/16 06:00'],"['2009/01/11 00:00 [received]', '2009/04/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/10/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/16 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1186/1757-1626-2-7526 [doi]'],epublish,Cases J. 2009 May 26;2:7526. doi: 10.1186/1757-1626-2-7526.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We studied 750 patients underwent allo-HSCT from Jan, 2005 to Aug, 2008. A total of 22 patients who developed into CMV pneumonia were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: Twenty-four episodes of CMV pneumonia occurred in the 22 patients (2.9%) and the majority of them developed into CMV pneumonia average 51 days ( 30 to 180 days) after allo-HSCT. Of the 22 patients 16 (72.7%) underwent CMV-DNA emia and 6 remained CMV-PCR negative throughout the course of the disease. The pulmonary CT manifestation of 23 episodes showed specific features of interstitial changes, including diffused or patchy ground-glass opacities. Better curative effects were obtained using antivirus drugs combined with glucocorticoid and the total curative ratio of CMV pneumonia was 83.3%. Male and the occurrence of severe acute graft-versus-host disease seemed to be correlated with an unfavorable outcome through univariate analysis(P=0.034, P=0.023). CONCLUSION: Making a diagnosis as soon as possible and appropriate therapy will improve the outcome of patients with CMV pneumonia markedly.","['Zhao, Xiao Su', 'Liu, Dai Hong', 'Xu, Lan Ping', 'Chen, Huan', 'Chen, Yu Hong', 'Zhang, Xiao Hui', 'Han, Wei', 'Wang, Yu', 'Liu, Kai Yan', 'Huang, Xiao Jun']","['Zhao XS', 'Liu DH', 'Xu LP', 'Chen H', 'Chen YH', 'Zhang XH', 'Han W', 'Wang Y', 'Liu KY', 'Huang XJ']","[""Institute of Hematology, Peking University People's Hospital, Beijing 100044, China.""]",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,China,Beijing Da Xue Xue Bao Yi Xue Ban,Beijing da xue xue bao.

The Friend retrovirus (FV) murine infection model is a good model to study immune responses in retroviral infections and hence was used to characterize the role of Th cells during acute infection. In vivo depletion of Th cells in acutely infected mice demonstrated that Th cells were vital in controlling viral spread and onset of erythroleukaemia and for the maintenance of FV-specific CD8(+) T-cell and neutralizing antibody responses. Kinetic analysis of FV-specific Th-cell responses using class-II tetramers showed that the magnitude of the Th-cell response correlated with the level of resistance to FV-induced leukaemia in different mouse strains. FV-specific CD4(+) T-cell receptor beta-transgenic (TCRbeta-tg) T cells were adoptively transferred into mice infected for different time periods [1, 2 and 3 weeks post-infection (p.i.)] to investigate the direct antiviral effect of CD4(+) T cells in FV infection. Results indicated that FV-specific CD4(+) TCRbeta-tg T cells were functionally active until 2 weeks p.i., retaining their ability to produce gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) and reduce viral loads. However, the donor cells lost their antiviral activity starting from 3 weeks p.i. Interestingly, in vivo depletion of regulatory T cells (Tregs) at this time point restored IFN-gamma production by transferred CD4(+) T cells. The current study reveals that Th cells were critical for recovery from acute FV infection but were functionally impaired during the late phase of acute infection due to induced Tregs.","['Nair, Savita R', 'Zelinskyy, Gennadiy', 'Schimmer, Simone', 'Gerlach, Nicole', 'Kassiotis, George', 'Dittmer, Ulf']","['Nair SR', 'Zelinskyy G', 'Schimmer S', 'Gerlach N', 'Kassiotis G', 'Dittmer U']","['Institute for Virology of the University Clinics in Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, 45147 Essen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091014,England,J Gen Virol,The Journal of general virology,0077340,,2009/10/16 06:00,2010/02/10 06:00,['2009/10/16 06:00'],"['2009/10/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/10 06:00 [medline]']","['vir.0.015834-0 [pii]', '10.1099/vir.0.015834-0 [doi]']",ppublish,J Gen Virol. 2010 Feb;91(Pt 2):440-51. doi: 10.1099/vir.0.015834-0.

Because chemokines are implicated in migration and extravasation of leukemic cells, chemokines might play a role in DS. ATRA stimulation of the APL cell line NB4 induced expression of multiple CC-chemokines (CCLs) and their receptors (> 19-fold), resulting in increased chemokine levels and chemotaxis. Induction of CCL2 and CCL24 was directly mediated by ligand-activated retinoic acid receptors. In primary leukemia cells derived from APL patients at diagnosis, ATRA induced chemokine production as well. Furthermore, in plasma of an APL patient with DS, we observed chemokine induction, suggesting that chemokines might be important in DS. Dexamethasone, which efficiently reduces pulmonary chemokine production, did not inhibit chemokine induction in APL cells. Finally, chemokine production was also induced by arsenic trioxide as single agent or in combination with ATRA.

Here, we investigated the role of ephrin-A4 (EFNA4) in the transendothelial migration (TEM) capacity of CLL and normal B cells through interacting with endothelial EphA2 (erythropoietin-producing hepatocellular carcinoma). CLL cells showed a remarkable impairment in the adhesion to and transmigration through human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) monolayers, correlating with their higher EFNA4 expression. In vitro, TEM was mediated by EFNA4 binding to endothelial EphA2 receptor, which is highly expressed in tumor necrosis factor-alpha-activated HUVECs as well as in the CD31(+) endothelial cells of human lymph nodes. The pretreatment of CLL cells with EphA2 homodimers further impaired their adhesion to and transmigration through HUVEC monolayers, whereas pretreatment of HUVECs with EFNA4 homodimers improved those phenomena in both CLL and normal B cells, suggesting that EFNA4 signaling negatively contributed to TEM. In fact, EFNA4 signaling into CLL cells significantly reduced their adhesion to intercellular adhesion molecule 1, vascular cell adhesion molecule 1, and several extracellular matrix molecules and impaired CCL-19-mediated TEM and chemotaxis. Our results suggest that EFNA4-EphA2 interactions are involved in CLL cell trafficking between blood and the tissues and therefore may become a therapeutic target in the future.","['Trinidad, Eva M', 'Ballesteros, Monica', 'Zuloaga, Jaime', 'Zapata, Agustin', 'Alonso-Colmenar, Luis M']","['Trinidad EM', 'Ballesteros M', 'Zuloaga J', 'Zapata A', 'Alonso-Colmenar LM']","['Microscopy and Cytometry Research Centre, Complutense University of Madrid, 28040 Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091014,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,2009/10/16 06:00,2010/01/06 06:00,['2009/10/16 06:00'],"['2009/10/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/06 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)38881-9 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2009-03-210617 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2009 Dec 3;114(24):5081-90. doi: 10.1182/blood-2009-03-210617.

In order to determine if evolutionarily distant retroviral Gag proteins are targeted by a similar mechanism, we generated mutants of the matrix (MA) domain of murine leukemia virus (MuLV) Gag, examined their binding to membrane models in vitro, and analyzed their phenotypes in cell culture. In vitro, we showed that MA bound all the phosphatidylinositol phosphates with significant affinity but displayed a strong specificity for PI(4,5)P(2) only if enhanced by phosphatidylserine. Mutations in the polybasic region in MA dramatically reduced this affinity. In cells, virus production was strongly impaired by PI(4,5)P(2) depletion under conditions of 5ptaseIV overexpression, and mutations in the MA polybasic region altered Gag localization, membrane binding, and virion production. Our results suggest that the N-terminal polybasic cluster of MA is essential for Gag targeting to the plasma membrane. The binding of the MA domain to PI(4,5)P(2) appears to be a conserved feature among retroviruses despite the fact that the MuLV-MA domain is structurally different from that of human immunodeficiency virus types 1 and 2 and lacks a readily identifiable PI(4,5)P(2) binding cleft.","['Hamard-Peron, E', 'Juillard, F', 'Saad, J S', 'Roy, C', 'Roingeard, P', 'Summers, M F', 'Darlix, J-L', 'Picart, C', 'Muriaux, D']","['Hamard-Peron E', 'Juillard F', 'Saad JS', 'Roy C', 'Roingeard P', 'Summers MF', 'Darlix JL', 'Picart C', 'Muriaux D']","['LaboRetro, Inserm U758, ENS de Lyon, IFR128, 69364 Lyon, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,PMC2798412,2009/10/16 06:00,2010/01/22 06:00,['2009/10/16 06:00'],"['2009/10/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/22 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.01134-09 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.01134-09 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2010 Jan;84(1):503-15. doi: 10.1128/JVI.01134-09.,1,IM,"['Binding Sites', 'Cell Membrane/*chemistry', 'Gene Products, gag/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*physiology', 'Mutagenesis', 'Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-Diphosphate/*metabolism', 'Phosphatidylserines', 'Retroviridae', 'Virus Replication']",,"['0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-Diphosphate)', '0 (Phosphatidylserines)']",,,"['R37 AI030917/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI30917/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is particularly due to the success of microarray technology. Thus, to understand mechanisms of disease pathogenesis on a molecular basis, e.g. in cancer research, the challenge of analyzing such different data types in an integrated way has become increasingly important. In order to tackle this problem, we propose a new procedure for an integrated analysis of two different data types that searches for genes and genetic regions which for both inputs display strong equally directed deviations from the reference median. We employ this approach, based on a modified correlation coefficient and an explorative Wilcoxon test, to find DNA regions of such abnormalities in GE and CN (e.g. underexpressed genes accompanied by a loss of DNA material). RESULTS: In an application to acute myeloid leukemia, our procedure is able to identify various regions on different chromosomes with characteristic abnormalities in GE and CN data and shows a higher sensitivity to differences in abnormalities than standard approaches. While the results support various findings of previous studies, some new interesting DNA regions can be identified. In a simulation study, our procedure also shows more reliable results than standard approaches.

The assay was based on 100microL serum samples, following acetonitrile precipitation of proteins and filtration that enabled direct injection into the LC/MS system. All analytes and the internal standard, alfuzosin, were separated by using a Zorbax Eclipse XDB-C(8) analytical column (2.1mmx150.0mm i.d., particle size 3.5microm) with isocratic elution. The mobile phase was composed of a mixture of water/acetonitrile containing 0.1%, v/v formic acid (75:25, v/v), pumped at a flow rate of 0.15mLmin(-1). Quantitation of the analytes was performed with selected ion monitoring (SIM) in positive ionization mode using electrospray ionization interface. The assay was found to be linear in the concentration range of 0.01-25.00microgmL(-1) for methotrexate and 0.01-5.00microgmL(-1) for folic acid, folinic acid and ondansetron. Intermediate precision was found to be less than 4.2% over the tested concentration ranges. A run time of less than 7.0min for each sample made it possible to analyze a large number of human serum samples per day. The method can be used to quantify methotrexate, folinic acid, folic acid and ondansetron in human serum covering a variety of clinical studies and it was applied to the analysis of human serum samples obtained from children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.","['Koufopantelis, Panagiotis', 'Georgakakou, Sophia', 'Kazanis, Michael', 'Giaginis, Costas', 'Margeli, Alexandra', 'Papargiri, Sophia', 'Panderi, Irene']","['Koufopantelis P', 'Georgakakou S', 'Kazanis M', 'Giaginis C', 'Margeli A', 'Papargiri S', 'Panderi I']","['University of Athens, School of Pharmacy, Division of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Panepistimiopolis, Zografou 157 71, Athens, Greece.']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091002,Netherlands,J Chromatogr B Analyt Technol Biomed Life Sci,"Journal of chromatography.

Verbascum has been used in popular medicine for treating wounds, chilblains, respiratory ailments, acne and arthritic disturbances. Inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) represents one of the three isoforms that produce nitric oxide using L-arginine as a substrate in response to an increase in superoxide anion activated by NF-kappaB. It is implicated in different pathophysiological events and its expression increases greatly during an inflammatory process due to oxidative stress. In our study we reproduced an inflammatory state by treating THP-1 cells (human myelomonocytic leukaemia) with pro-inflammatory stimuli, such as LPS and IFN-gamma, obtaining an up-regulation both in the expression and in the activity of iNOS. The aim of our work is to investigate the possible antiinflammatory action of verbascoside extract from Verbascum mallophorum using a concentration of 100 muM. Our results show a significant decrease in the expression and activity of iNOS and extracellular O2- when cells were treated with verbascoside.

EVIDENCE REPORT DATA SOURCES: Medline, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, bibliographies of selected reviews, and suggestions from domain experts were surveyed. Searches were limited to English-language publications. EVIDENCE REPORT REVIEW METHODS: Eligible comparisons examined the association between differential exposure to breastfeeding and health outcomes. We assessed 15 infant and six maternal outcomes. For four outcomes, we also updated previously published systematic reviews. For the rest of the outcomes, we either summarized previous systematic reviews or conducted new systematic reviews; randomized and non-randomized comparative trials, prospective cohorts, and case-control studies were included. Adjusted estimates were extracted from non-experimental designs. The studies were graded for methodological quality. We did not draw conclusions from poor quality studies. EVIDENCE REPORT RESULTS: We screened over 9,000 abstracts. Thirty-two primary studies on term infant health outcomes, 43 primary studies on maternal health outcomes, and 28 systematic reviews or meta-analyses that covered approximately 400 individual studies were included in this review. A history of breastfeeding was associated with a reduction in the risk of acute otitis media, nonspecific gastroenteritis, severe lower respiratory tract infections, atopic dermatitis, asthma (young children), obesity, type 1 and 2 diabetes, childhood leukemia, and sudden infant death syndrome. There was no relationship between breastfeeding in term infants and cognitive performance. There were insufficient good quality data to address the relationship between breastfeeding and cardiovascular diseases and infant mortality. For maternal outcomes, a history of lactation was associated with a reduced risk of type 2 diabetes, breast, and ovarian cancer. Early cessation of breastfeeding or no breastfeeding was associated with an increased risk of maternal postpartum depression. There was no relationship between a history of lactation and the risk of osteoporosis. The effect of breastfeeding in mothers on return-to-prepregnancy weight was negligible, and the effect of breastfeeding on postpartum weight loss was unclear. EVIDENCE REPORT CONCLUSIONS: A history of breastfeeding is associated with a reduced risk of many diseases in infants and mothers. Future research would benefit from clearer selection criteria, definitions of breastfeeding exposure, and adjustment for potential confounders. Matched designs such as sibling analysis may provide a method to control for hereditary and household factors that are important in certain outcomes.","['Ip, Stanley', 'Chung, Mei', 'Raman, Gowri', 'Trikalinos, Thomas A', 'Lau, Joseph']","['Ip S', 'Chung M', 'Raman G', 'Trikalinos TA', 'Lau J']","['Institute for Clinical Research and Health Policy Studies, Tufts Medical Center Evidence-Based Practice Center, 800 Washington Street, Boston, MA 02111, USA.

Subjects were cancer patients less than 15 years of age in Hiroshima City registered in the Hiroshima City Cancer Registry and/or the Hiroshima Prefecture Tumor Registry (tissue registry) between 1998 and 2000. Cancer incidence in Hiroshima City was calculated for 12 diagnostic groups according to the International Classification of Childhood Cancer, and compared with general incidence in Japan. Five-year survival was calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method. There were 63 children who had a cancer newly diagnosed during 1998-2000, with only one death-certificate-only case (1.6%). Age-standardized incidence rates (per million) were 144.3 for boys and 93.9 for girls. Leukemia was the most frequent (29%) among the 12 diagnostic groups. There were 13 cancer deaths during this period and five-year survival was 79% (95% Confidence Interval: 67%-87%). Childhood cancer incidence was slightly higher than that for all of Japan, but the relative distribution of patients by diagnostic group was compatible with the general pattern. Both of these observations might be due to the high quality of the tumor and tissue registries.","['Sugiyama, Hiromi', 'Nishi, Nobuo', 'Kuwabara, Masao', 'Ninomiya, Motoki', 'Arita, Ken-ichi', 'Yasui, Wataru', 'Kasagi, Fumiyoshi', 'Kodama, Kazunori']","['Sugiyama H', 'Nishi N', 'Kuwabara M', 'Ninomiya M', 'Arita K', 'Yasui W', 'Kasagi F', 'Kodama K']","['Department of Epidemiology, Radiation Effects Research Foundation, Hiroshima, Japan. sugi@rerf.or.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",,Thailand,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,101130625,,2009/10/16 06:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/10/16 06:00'],"['2009/10/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev. 2009 Oct-Dec;10(4):675-80.,4,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Japan/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mortality/*trends', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Neoplasms/diagnosis/*mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Registries/*statistics & numerical data', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate', 'Young Adult']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: This is a single centre study extending from January 1997 to June 2003. Data were retrieved from the patients' records on predetermined performance and analyzed. Patients were primarily diagnosed on the basis of clinical findings, complete blood counts and leukocyte alkaline phosphate (LAP) scores. Bone marrow/trephine and genetic studies were conducted where appropriate. Patients were primarily treated with capsule hydroxyurea 30-50/ kg/day. RESULTS: One hundred and seventy six patients, 104 (59%) male and 72 (41%) females were included in the study. The median age at diagnosis was 39 years (range 11 to 66 years). The median delay in diagnosis was 156 days (range 30 to 360 days). Eighty four patients (47.7%) presented with pain/discomfort in the left hypochondrium. The mean hemoglobin, white blood cell count and platelet counts were 10.3 g/dl, 141,000/UL and 341,000/UL respectively associated with a low LAP score. Hyper-leucocytosis was observed in 19 (10.7%) cases. LDH values above 1,000 ug/l were observed in 38 (21.5%) cases and creatinine above 1.5 ug/l in 21 (12%) cases. All patients tested, were positive for Philadelphia chromosome and bcr-abl transcripts. At the close of the study, disease advancement was observed in 76 (43.2%) cases, of which 35 (20%) transformed to acute leukemia. One hundred and forty three patients (81%) were alive at the close of the study. One hundred and two (58.4%) patients were in chronic phase, 22 (12.5%) in accelerated phase and 19 (10.7%) in blast crisis. Disease progression remained the major cause of death and was seen in 29 (16.4%) patients. CONCLUSION: In the study population, CML was observed in a younger age group with significant delay in definitive diagnosis.

Repeated chromosomal analyses were accomplished in 23 patients that presented with cell clones showing various karyotype abnormalities prior to the onset of therapy. All the patients were treated following identical protocols. Complete hematological remission was achieved in 20 cases. The majority of patients did not have cells with chromosomal abnormalities changes after a 2-4 month follow up. Anomalous metaphases persisted in 6 patients although their occurrence decreased. Five of them poorly responded to therapy whereas simultaneous achievement of morphological and cytogenetic remission ensured more beneficial outcome of the treatment. Results of the study agree with recent reports of delayed reversion to normal karyotype under effect of AML therapy that as a rule predicts an unfavourable prognosis Repeated analysis during stable hematological remission did not reveal cells with karyotype abnormalities in bone marrow with the exception of a single patient who had marrow cells with chromosomal translocation (16:16) up to the 8th month of complete hematological remission. This patient remains under observation (duration of remission is now 15 months). It was shown that the relative amount of cells with abnormal karyotype in bone marrow frequently exceeds that of blast cells (usually before the onset of therapy and sometimes in the beginning of morphological remission). During stable remission, such an excess is an antecedent of relapse. It is concluded that cytogenetic analysis for monitoring AML extends the possibility of detecting leukemia cells.","['Fleishman, E V', 'Sokova, O I', 'Popa, A V', 'Konstantinova, L N', ""Metel'kova, N F"", 'Serebriakova, I N', 'Peregudov, D A']","['Fleishman EV', 'Sokova OI', 'Popa AV', 'Konstantinova LN', ""Metel'kova NF"", 'Serebriakova IN', 'Peregudov DA']",,['rus'],"['Comparative Study', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",,Russia (Federation),Vestn Ross Akad Med Nauk,Vestnik Rossiiskoi akademii meditsinskikh nauk,9215641,,2009/10/16 06:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/10/16 06:00'],"['2009/10/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Vestn Ross Akad Med Nauk. 2009;(9):28-32.,9,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Male', 'Prognosis']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HPCs may be collected from bone marrow, peripheral blood, or umbilical cord blood. In order to minimize the risk for healthy HPC donors, thorough investigation is required before donation. The donor work-up should include medical history, physical examination, ECG, chest x-ray, blood count, coagulation screening, and testing for infectious disease markers. Donors should be fully informed on the donation procedure and sign an informed consent for donation. HPCs are traditionally collected from bone marrow with the donor in general anesthesia. The procedure includes multiple bone marrow aspirates from pelvic bones and at least overnight hospital stay. Although marrow donation is generally safe and well tolerated, minor complications like pain at the collection site, fatigue and pain on walking or sitting may occur in a relatively small proportion of donors (6%-20%). Major and life-threatening complications such as anesthesia-related events, mechanical injury to the bone, sacroiliac joint and sciatic nerve following marrow donation are relatively rare, being estimated to 0.1%-0.3% of cases. In the last decade, peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPC) have become an increasingly used altemative to bone marrow. PBPC transplantation offers faster hematopoietic recovery and lower early transplant-related morbidity and mortality. The incidence of acute graft vs. host disease (GvHD) is no greater than in bone marrow transplants. However, there is evidence for increased chronic GvHD, which is in part related to the higher number of T and NK cells that are collected with PBPC and re-infused to the patient. Recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) is used to mobilize PBPCs for collection by leukapheresis. Leukapheresis is usually perfomed after 4 to 5 days of G-CSF subcutaneous administration at a dose of 10 mg/kg b.w. Vascular access for apheresis may be accomplished by use of apheresis needle in antecubital vein. Placement of a double-lumen central apheresis catheter is rarely required in healthy donors. Citrate is the most commonly used anticoagulant for apheresis. One to three leukapheresis procedures are required to collect adequate graft. There is an interindividual variation in progenitor cell mobilization among healthy donors, with a subset of donors that do not exhibit effective CD34+ cell mobilization. Donor age and G-CSF schedule are the factors that significantly affect PBPC mobilization and collection in healthy donors. Procedures for mobilization and collection of PBPC from healthy donors are generally well tolerated. Common adverse reactions of G-CSF application include bone pain, myalgia, headache and fatigue. Beside these mild side effects, moderate to life-threatening complications are sporadically observed. Spontaneous splenic rupture, acute lung injury, acute iritis, severe pyogenic infections, and anaphylactoid reactions were reported in healthy donors after G-CSF administration. Adverse effects of apheresis for PBPC collection are the same as for other apheresis procedure and include complications related to venous access and citrate toxicity. Leukapheresis typically results in a lower platelet count, an effect that is exacerbated by the use of G-CSF, which has been documented to cause mild, reversible thrombocytopenia. Fewer side effects were noted in pediatric donors compared to adult donors. PBPC collection in pediatric donors is safe and desired PBPC yields are easily achieved. Theoretical concerns exist about the potentially increasing long-term risk of leukemia after G-CSF administration in healthy donors. Recently, a report of AML developing in a 62-year-old female donor 14 months after G-CSF-primed PBPC donation has been published. Whether G-CSF therapy contributed to the development of this cancer is unknown, but future studies should carefully follow the donors and report any similar event. According to currently available evidence, the risk of major late toxicities secondary to administration of G-CSF is minimal.","['Bojanic, Ines', 'Cepulic, Branka Golubic', 'Mazic, Sanja']","['Bojanic I', 'Cepulic BG', 'Mazic S']","['Zavod za klinicku transfuziologiju, Klinicki zavod za laboratorijsku dijagnostiku, Klinicki bolnicki centar Zagreb, Zagreb, Hrvatska. ibojanic@kbc-zagreb.hr']",['hrv'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",,Croatia,Acta Med Croatica,Acta medica Croatica : casopis Hravatske akademije medicinskih znanosti,9208249,,2009/10/16 06:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/10/16 06:00'],"['2009/10/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Acta Med Croatica. 2009 Jun;63(3):237-44.,3,IM,"['Female', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization/*methods', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukapheresis/*methods', 'Male', 'Tissue Donors', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",45,['143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)'],,Prikupljanje krvotvornih maticnih stanica zdravih davatelja.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Autologous stem cells can be obtained in most instances from the patient's bone marrow or peripheral blood. The blood is the preferred source of stem cells because of easier collection and faster hematologic recovery post-transplantation. Prospective clinical trials confirmed the role of autologous SCT in the treatment of chemosensitive non-Hodgkin's lymphomas and Hodgkin's disease after first relapse, and probably in selected high-risk patients in earlier stage of the disease. In multiple myeloma, autologous SCT is a standard treatment approach for all patients younger than 65, either as a single transplant or as a tandem transplant in patients that failed to achieve complete or very good response after first transplant. In acute leukemia, the role of autologous SCT is less well defined although in acute myeloid leukemia several studies resulted in statistically superior patient outcome in comparison to chemotherapy. Advances in supportive therapy and use of peripheral blood stem cells have made autologous SCT a relatively safe treatment modality with attributable mortality mainly less than 5%. Yet, the relatively high incidence of relapse after transplantation remains a major problem. A variety of methods have been under investigation before and after transplantation to reduce the risk of relapse and improve the results of treatment.","['Nemet, Damir']",['Nemet D'],"['Zavod za hematologiju, Klinika za unutarnje bolesti, Medicinskifakultet Sveucilista u Zagrebu i Klinicki bolnicki centar Zagreb, Zagreb, Hrvatska.']",['hrv'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",,Croatia,Acta Med Croatica,Acta medica Croatica : casopis Hravatske akademije medicinskih znanosti,9208249,,2009/10/16 06:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/10/16 06:00'],"['2009/10/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Acta Med Croatica. 2009 Jun;63(3):219-25.,3,IM,"['Hematologic Neoplasms/therapy', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",35,,,Transplantacija autolognih maticnih krvotvornih stanica.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Problems with historical exposure estimation, however, may have distorted the association. To evaluate the impact of potential inaccuracies in exposure estimation, we conducted uncertainty analyses of the relation between cumulative exposure to butadiene and leukemia. We created the 1,000 sets of butadiene estimates using job-exposure matrices consisting of exposure values that corresponded to randomly selected percentiles of the approximate probability distribution of plant-, work area/job group-, and year specific butadiene ppm. We then analyzed the relation between cumulative exposure to butadiene and leukemia for each of the 1,000 sets of butadiene estimates. In the uncertainty analysis, the point estimate of the RR for the first non zero exposure category (>0-<37.5 ppm-years) was most likely to be about 1.5. The rate ratio for the second exposure category (37.5-<184.7 ppm-years) was most likely to range from 1.5 to 1.8. The RR for category 3 of exposure (184.7-<425.0 ppm-years) was most likely between 2.1 and 3.0. The RR for the highest exposure category (425.0+ ppm-years) was likely to be between 2.9 and 3.7. This range off RR point estimates can best be interpreted as a probability distribution that describes our uncertainty in RR point estimates due to uncertainty in exposure estimation. After considering the complete probability distributions of butadiene exposure estimates, the exposure-response association of butadiene and leukemia was maintained. This exercise was a unique example of how uncertainty analyses can be used to investigate and support an observed measure of effect when occupational exposure estimates are employed in the absence of direct exposure measurements.","['Graff, John J', 'Sathiakumar, Nalini', 'Macaluso, Maurizio', 'Maldonado, George', 'Matthews, Robert', 'Delzell, Elizabeth']","['Graff JJ', 'Sathiakumar N', 'Macaluso M', 'Maldonado G', 'Matthews R', 'Delzell E']","['Wayne State University School of Medicine, Karmanos Cancer Institute, Detroit, MI 48201, USA. graffj@karmanos.org']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20090911,Switzerland,Int J Environ Res Public Health,International journal of environmental research and public health,101238455,PMC2760421,2009/10/15 06:00,2010/01/22 06:00,['2009/10/15 06:00'],"['2009/07/16 00:00 [received]', '2009/09/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/10/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/22 06:00 [medline]']","['10.3390/ijerph6092436 [doi]', 'ijerph6092436 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Environ Res Public Health. 2009 Sep;6(9):2436-55. doi: 10.3390/ijerph6092436.

However, association studies on MTR A2756G polymorphism in cancers have reported conflicting results. Therefore we performed a meta-analysis to better assess the associations. A total of 24 896 cancer patients and 33 862 controls from 52 articles for MTR A2756G were investigated. Overall, individuals carrying MTR 2756GG genotype had a subtly reduced cancer risk under a recessive genetic model (odds ratio (OR), 0.92; P=0.053; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 0.84-1.00; I(2)=0.0%; P(heterogeneity)=0.61).

Genetic abnormalities detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and immunoglobulin heavy chain variable gene region (IGHV) mutational status are well-known independent prognostic indicators in CLL/SLL. Given the requirement for specialized testing to detect such aberrations, we investigated whether morphologic features may predict the presence of a more or less favorable genetic profile. Forty-one SLL cases were morphologically evaluated for expanded proliferation centers, increased large cells outside of proliferation centers, and nuclear contour irregularities (NCI) in small and large tumor cells. ZAP-70 immunohistochemistry and FISH (deletions of 13q14, p53 and ATM and trisomy 12) were successful in all cases. IGHV mutational status was determined in 26/41 cases. Significant NCI in both small and large cells correlated with the presence of an unfavorable FISH abnormality (ie, ATM or p53 deletions). However, despite good specificity (94%), the sensitivity (57%) of this finding is inadequate for routine use. No other significant associations with morphologic features were identified. Strong ZAP-70 positivity correlated with unmutated IGHV (P=0.001), rendering ZAP-70 IHC a useful surrogate for IGHV mutational status. ZAP-70 positivity predicted against finding a favorable FISH deletion 13q14 (P=0.023). Although we only studied 41 cases, we corroborated their validity using Kaplan-Meier overall survival analysis. In conclusion, morphologic features in SLL are not a reliable predictor of underlying genetic status. Thus, we propose a practical, cost-effective approach to the work-up of these cases, which should be driven by clinical necessity.","['Garcia, Christine F', 'Hunt, Kristin E', 'Kang, Huining', 'Babb, Amy', 'Gale, James M', 'Vasef, Mohammad A', 'Reichard, Kaaren K']","['Garcia CF', 'Hunt KE', 'Kang H', 'Babb A', 'Gale JM', 'Vasef MA', 'Reichard KK']","['Department of Pathology, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Appl Immunohistochem Mol Morphol,Applied immunohistochemistry & molecular morphology : AIMM,100888796,,2009/10/15 06:00,2010/06/15 06:00,['2009/10/15 06:00'],"['2009/10/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/PAI.0b013e3181bbd5d5 [doi]'],ppublish,Appl Immunohistochem Mol Morphol. 2010 Mar;18(2):119-27. doi: 10.1097/PAI.0b013e3181bbd5d5.,2,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Size', 'Chromosome Aberrations', '*Cytological Techniques', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*diagnosis/genetics/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/metabolism', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/metabolism', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase/genetics/metabolism']",,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (IGH-CCND1 fusion protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We randomly assigned 2,157 patients (age range, 15 to 60 years) to receive intensive induction-consolidation chemotherapy containing either daunorubicin, idarubicin, or mitoxantrone. After achieving complete remission (CR), patients were assigned to undergo either allogeneic or autologous stem-cell transplantation (SCT), depending on the availability of a sibling donor. RESULTS: The overall CR rate (69%) was similar in the three groups. Autologous SCT was performed in 37% of cases in the daunorubicin arm versus only 29% and 31% in mitoxantrone and idarubicin, respectively (P < .001). However, the disease-free survival (DFS) and survival from CR were significantly shorter in the daunorubicin arm: the 5-year DFS was 29% versus 37% and 37% in mitoxantrone and idarubicin, respectively. The proportion of patients who underwent allogeneic SCT (22%) was equivalent in the three treatment groups, and the outcome was similar as well. The [corrected] 5-year overall survival rates were 31%, 34%, and 34%, [corrected] respectively.

On the basis of observed responses in a phase I trial, a phase II trial of romidepsin in patients with T-cell lymphoma was initiated. PATIENTS AND METHODS The initial cohort was limited to patients with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL), or subtypes mycosis fungoides or Sezary syndrome, who had received no more than two prior cytotoxic regimens. There were no limits on other types of therapy. Subsequently, the protocol was expanded to enroll patients who had received more than two prior cytotoxic regimens. Results Twenty-seven patients were enrolled onto the first cohort, and a total of 71 patients are included in this analysis. These patients had undergone a median of four prior treatments, and 62 patients (87%) had advanced-stage disease (stage IIB, n = 15; stage III, n= 6; or stage IV, n = 41). Toxicities included nausea, vomiting, fatigue, and transient thrombocytopenia and granulocytopenia. Pharmacokinetics were evaluated with the first administration of romidepsin. Complete responses were observed in four patients, and partial responses were observed in 20 patients for an overall response rate of 34% (95% CI, 23% to 46%).

The acetylation status of histones regulates access of transcription factors to DNA and influences levels of gene expression. Histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity diminishes acetylation of histones, causing compaction of the DNA/histone complex. This compaction blocks gene transcription and inhibits differentiation, providing a rationale for developing HDAC inhibitors. METHODS: In this review, we explore the biology of the HDAC enzymes, summarize the pharmacologic properties of HDAC inhibitors, and examine results of selected clinical trials. We consider the potential of these inhibitors in combination therapy with targeted drugs and with cytotoxic chemotherapy. RESULTS: HDAC inhibitors promote growth arrest, differentiation, and apoptosis of tumor cells, with minimal effects on normal tissue. In addition to decompaction of the histone/DNA complex, HDAC inhibition also affects acetylation status and function of nonhistone proteins. HDAC inhibitors have demonstrated antitumor activity in clinical trials, and one drug of this class, vorinostat, is US Food and Drug Administration approved for the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Other inhibitors in advanced stages of clinical development, including depsipeptide and MGCD0103, differ from vorinostat in structure and isoenzyme specificity, and have shown activity against lymphoma, leukemia, and solid tumors. Promising preclinical activity in combination with cytotoxics, inhibitors of heat shock protein 90, and inhibitors of proteasome function have led to combination therapy trials. CONCLUSION: HDAC inhibitors are an important emerging therapy with single-agent activity against multiple cancers, and have significant potential in combination use.","['Lane, Andrew A', 'Chabner, Bruce A']","['Lane AA', 'Chabner BA']","['Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center, Boston, MA 02214, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20091013,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,2009/10/15 06:00,2010/01/07 06:00,['2009/10/15 06:00'],"['2009/10/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/07 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2009.22.1291 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2009.22.1291 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2009 Nov 10;27(32):5459-68. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2009.22.1291.

A phase I study of a pharmacokinetically derived schedule of flavopiridol suggested promising activity in CLL, irrespective of high-risk features. Given the relevance of these findings to treating genetically high-risk CLL, a prospective confirmatory study was initiated. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with relapsed CLL were treated with single-agent flavopiridol, with subsequent addition of dexamethasone to suppress cytokine release syndrome (CRS). High-risk genomic features were prospectively assessed for response to therapy. RESULTS: Sixty-four patients were enrolled. Median age was 60 years, median number of prior therapies was four, and all patients had received prior purine analog therapy. If patients tolerated treatment during week 1, dose escalation occurred during week 2. Dose escalation did not occur in four patients, as a result of severe tumor lysis syndrome; three of these patients required hemodialysis. Thirty-four patients (53%) achieved response, including 30 partial responses (PRs; 47%), three nodular PRs (5%), and one complete response (1.6%). A majority of high-risk patients responded; 12 (57%) of 21 patients with del(17p13.1) and 14 (50%) of 28 patients with del(11q22.3) responded irrespective of lymph node size. Median progression-free survival among responders was 10 to 12 months across all cytogenetic risk groups. Reducing the number of weekly treatments per cycle from four to three and adding prophylactic dexamethasone, which abrogated interleukin-6 release and CRS (P < or = .01), resulted in improved tolerability and treatment delivery. CONCLUSION: Flavopiridol achieves significant clinical activity in patients with relapsed CLL, including those with high-risk genomic features and bulky lymphadenopathy. Subsequent clinical trials should use the amended treatment schedule developed herein and prophylactic corticosteroids.","['Lin, Thomas S', 'Ruppert, Amy S', 'Johnson, Amy J', 'Fischer, Beth', 'Heerema, Nyla A', 'Andritsos, Leslie A', 'Blum, Kristie A', 'Flynn, Joseph M', 'Jones, Jeffrey A', 'Hu, Weihong', 'Moran, Mollie E', 'Mitchell, Sarah M', 'Smith, Lisa L', 'Wagner, Amy J', 'Raymond, Chelsey A', 'Schaaf, Larry J', 'Phelps, Mitch A', 'Villalona-Calero, Miguel A', 'Grever, Michael R', 'Byrd, John C']","['Lin TS', 'Ruppert AS', 'Johnson AJ', 'Fischer B', 'Heerema NA', 'Andritsos LA', 'Blum KA', 'Flynn JM', 'Jones JA', 'Hu W', 'Moran ME', 'Mitchell SM', 'Smith LL', 'Wagner AJ', 'Raymond CA', 'Schaaf LJ', 'Phelps MA', 'Villalona-Calero MA', 'Grever MR', 'Byrd JC']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091013,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,PMC2793044,2009/10/15 06:00,2009/12/25 06:00,['2009/10/15 06:00'],"['2009/10/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/25 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2009.22.6944 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2009.22.6944 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2009 Dec 10;27(35):6012-8. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2009.22.6944.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Seventy-nine patients (40 with PV and 39 with ET) have been treated. Median time from diagnosis to PEG-IFN-alpha-2a was 54 months in patients with PV and 33 months in patients with ET. Eighty-one percent of patients had received prior therapy. The first three patients received PEG-IFN-alpha-2a at 450 microg weekly. As a result of poor tolerance, this dose was decreased in a stepwise manner to a current starting dose of 90 microg weekly. Seventy-seven patients are evaluable and have been observed for a median of 21 months. RESULTS: The overall hematologic response rate was 80% in PV and 81% in ET (complete in 70% and 76% of patients, respectively). The JAK2(V617F) mutation was detected in 18 patients with ET and 38 patients with PV; sequential measurements by a pyrosequencing assay were available in 16 patients with ET and 35 patients with PV. The molecular response rate was 38% in ET and 54% in PV, being complete (undetectable JAK2(V617F)) in 6% and 14%, respectively. The JAK2(V617F) mutant allele burden continued to decrease with no clear evidence for a plateau. The tolerability of PEG-IFN-alpha-2a at 90 microg weekly was excellent. CONCLUSION: PEG-IFN-alpha-2a resulted in remarkable clinical activity, high rates of molecular response, and acceptable toxicity in patients with advanced ET or PV. The ability of PEG-IFN-alpha-2a to induce complete molecular responses suggests selective targeting of the malignant clone.","['Quintas-Cardama, Alfonso', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Manshouri, Taghi', 'Luthra, Rajyalakshmi', 'Estrov, Zeev', 'Pierce, Sherry', 'Richie, Mary Ann', 'Borthakur, Gautam', 'Konopleva, Marina', 'Cortes, Jorge', 'Verstovsek, Srdan']","['Quintas-Cardama A', 'Kantarjian H', 'Manshouri T', 'Luthra R', 'Estrov Z', 'Pierce S', 'Richie MA', 'Borthakur G', 'Konopleva M', 'Cortes J', 'Verstovsek S']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article']",20091013,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,PMC4881362,2009/10/15 06:00,2010/01/07 06:00,['2009/10/15 06:00'],"['2009/10/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/07 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2009.23.6075 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2009.23.6075 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2009 Nov 10;27(32):5418-24. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2009.23.6075.

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is characterized by clonal expansion of predominately nonproliferating mature B cells. Here, we present data suggesting PBOX-15 is a potential therapeutic agent for CLL. We show activity of PBOX-15 in samples taken from a cohort of CLL patients (n = 55) representing both high-risk and low-risk disease. PBOX-15 exhibited cytotoxicity in CLL cells (n = 19) in a dose-dependent manner, with mean IC(50) of 0.55 micromol/L. PBOX-15 significantly induced apoptosis in CLL cells (n = 46) including cells with poor prognostic markers: unmutated IgV(H) genes, CD38 and zeta-associated protein 70 (ZAP-70) expression, and fludarabine-resistant cells with chromosomal deletions in 17p. In addition, PBOX-15 was more potent than fludarabine in inducing apoptosis in fludarabine-sensitive cells. Pharmacologic inhibition and small interfering RNA knockdown of caspase-8 significantly inhibited PBOX-15-induced apoptosis. Pharmacologic inhibition of c-jun NH(2)-terminal kinase inhibited PBOX-15-induced apoptosis in mutated IgV(H) and ZAP-70(-) CLL cells but not in unmutated IgV(H) and ZAP-70(+) cells. PBOX-15 exhibited selective cytotoxicity in CLL cells compared with normal hematopoietic cells. Our data suggest that PBOX-15 represents a novel class of agents that are toxic toward both high-risk and low-risk CLL cells. The need for novel treatments is acute in CLL, especially for the subgroup of patients with poor clinical outcome and drug-resistant disease. This study identifies a novel agent with significant clinical potential.","['McElligott, Anthony M', 'Maginn, Elaina N', 'Greene, Lisa M', 'McGuckin, Siobhan', 'Hayat, Amjad', 'Browne, Paul V', 'Butini, Stefania', 'Campiani, Giuseppe', 'Catherwood, Mark A', 'Vandenberghe, Elisabeth', 'Williams, D Clive', 'Zisterer, Daniela M', 'Lawler, Mark']","['McElligott AM', 'Maginn EN', 'Greene LM', 'McGuckin S', 'Hayat A', 'Browne PV', 'Butini S', 'Campiani G', 'Catherwood MA', 'Vandenberghe E', 'Williams DC', 'Zisterer DM', 'Lawler M']","['John Durkan Research Laboratories, Institute of Molecular Medicine, Trinity College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland. tony.mcelligott@tcd.ie']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091013,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,,2009/10/15 06:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/10/15 06:00'],"['2009/10/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['0008-5472.CAN-09-0131 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-09-0131 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2009 Nov 1;69(21):8366-75. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-09-0131.

The putative gene(s) deleted and responsible for the pathogenesis of these poor prognosis hematologic disorders remain controversial. This study is a comprehensive analysis of previously implicated and novel genes for epigenetic inactivation in AML and MDS. In 146 AML cases, methylation of CTNNA1 was frequent, and more common in AML patients with 5q deletion (31%) than those without 5q deletion (14%), whereas no methylation of other 5q genes was observed. In 31 MDS cases, CTNNA1 methylation was only found in high-risk MDS (>or=RAEB2), but not in low-risk MDS (<RAEB2), indicating that CTNNA1 methylation might be important in the transformation of MDS to AML. CTNNA1 expression was lowest in AML/MDS patients with CTNNA1 methylation, although reduced expression was found in some patients without promoter methylation. Repressive chromatin marks (H3K27me3) at the promoter were identified in CTNNA1-repressed AML cell lines and primary leukemias, with the most repressive state correlating with DNA methylation. These results suggest progressive, acquired epigenetic inactivation at CTNNA1, including histone modifications and promoter CpG methylation, as a component of leukemia progression in patients with both 5q- and non-5q- myeloid malignancies.","['Ye, Ying', 'McDevitt, Michael A', 'Guo, Mingzhou', 'Zhang, Wei', 'Galm, Oliver', 'Gore, Steven D', 'Karp, Judith E', 'Maciejewski, Jaroslaw P', 'Kowalski, Jeanne', 'Tsai, Hua-Ling', 'Gondek, Lukasz P', 'Tsai, Hsing-Chen', 'Wang, Xiaofei', 'Hooker, Craig', 'Smith, B Douglas', 'Carraway, Hetty E', 'Herman, James G']","['Ye Y', 'McDevitt MA', 'Guo M', 'Zhang W', 'Galm O', 'Gore SD', 'Karp JE', 'Maciejewski JP', 'Kowalski J', 'Tsai HL', 'Gondek LP', 'Tsai HC', 'Wang X', 'Hooker C', 'Smith BD', 'Carraway HE', 'Herman JG']","['Department of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland 21205, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091013,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,PMC3081599,2009/10/15 06:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/10/15 06:00'],"['2009/10/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['0008-5472.CAN-09-1153 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-09-1153 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2009 Nov 1;69(21):8482-90. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-09-1153.

Both Runx1 and the t(8;21)-encoded AML1-ETO occupy the miR-24-23-27 locus and reciprocally control miR-24 transcription. miR-24 directly downregulates mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphatase-7 and enhances phosphorylation of both c-jun-NH(2)-kinase and p38 kinases.

The transcriptional activity of ERalpha is mediated through two transactivation functions, called activation function 1 and 2, whose respective involvement varies in a cell-specific manner. Here, we identify the Rho/megakaryoblastic leukemia 1 (MKL1) signaling pathway as a main actor in controlling the cell-specific activity of both transactivation functions of ERalpha. Notably, we show that, when the coregulator MKL1 is sequestered in an inactive form by unpolymerized actin, the transcriptional activity of ERalpha mainly relies on the activation function 1. The activation of MKL1, which results from its dissociation from unpolymerized actin, promoted by the ability of Rho to support polymeric actin accumulation, silences the activation function 1 of ERalpha and allows the receptor to mainly act through its activation function 2. Importantly, this switch in the respective contribution exerted by both transactivation functions is correlated with an impaired ability of ERalpha to efficiently transactivate estrogen-regulated reporter genes. MKL1 is further shown to be present on estrogen-responsive genes in vivo. Interestingly, the Rho/MKL1 signaling pathway is activated during the epithelial-mesenchymal transition. A reduced transactivation efficiency of ERalpha, resulting from the activation of this pathway, may therefore suppress the protective role exerted by ERalpha toward tumor progression and invasiveness.","['Huet, Guillaume', 'Merot, Yohann', 'Percevault, Frederic', 'Tiffoche, Christophe', 'Arnal, Jean-Francois', 'Boujrad, Noureddine', 'Pakdel, Farzad', 'Metivier, Raphael', 'Flouriot, Gilles']","['Huet G', 'Merot Y', 'Percevault F', 'Tiffoche C', 'Arnal JF', 'Boujrad N', 'Pakdel F', 'Metivier R', 'Flouriot G']","['Equipe Recepteurs des Estrogenes et Destinee Cellulaire, UMR CNRS 6026, Universite de Rennes I, Campus de Beaulieu, 35042 Rennes Cedex, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091013,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,PMC2797142,2009/10/15 06:00,2009/12/23 06:00,['2009/10/15 06:00'],"['2009/10/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/23 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)37652-3 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M109.045534 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2009 Dec 4;284(49):33729-39. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M109.045534.

Murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells that coexpress GATA-1 and PU.1 are blocked at the blast stage but respond to molecular removal (downregulation) of PU.1 or addition (upregulation) of GATA-1 by inducing terminal erythroid differentiation. To test whether GATA-1 blocks PU.1 in MEL cells, we have conditionally activated a transgenic PU.1 protein fused with the estrogen receptor ligand-binding domain (PUER), resulting in activation of a myeloid transcriptional program. Gene expression arrays identified components of the PU.1-dependent transcriptome negatively regulated by GATA-1 in MEL cells, including CCAAT/enhancer binding protein alpha (Cebpa) and core-binding factor, beta subunit (Cbfb), which encode two key hematopoietic transcription factors. Inhibition of GATA-1 by small interfering RNA resulted in derepression of PU.1 target genes. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and reporter assays identified PU.1 motif sequences near Cebpa and Cbfb that are co-occupied by PU.1 and GATA-1 in the leukemic blasts. Significant derepression of Cebpa and Cbfb is achieved in MEL cells by either activation of PU.1 or knockdown of GATA-1. Furthermore, transcriptional regulation of these loci by manipulating the levels of PU.1 and GATA-1 involves quantitative increases in a transcriptionally active chromatin mark: acetylation of histone H3K9. Collectively, we show that either activation of PU.1 or inhibition of GATA-1 efficiently reverses the transcriptional block imposed by GATA-1 and leads to the activation of a myeloid transcriptional program directed by PU.1.","['Burda, Pavel', 'Curik, Nikola', 'Kokavec, Juraj', 'Basova, Petra', 'Mikulenkova, Dana', 'Skoultchi, Arthur I', 'Zavadil, Jiri', 'Stopka, Tomas']","['Burda P', 'Curik N', 'Kokavec J', 'Basova P', 'Mikulenkova D', 'Skoultchi AI', 'Zavadil J', 'Stopka T']","['Institute of Pathological Physiology and Center of Experimental Hematology, First Faculty of Medicine, Charles University in Prague, Prague, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091013,United States,Mol Cancer Res,Molecular cancer research : MCR,101150042,PMC3193075,2009/10/15 06:00,2010/02/13 06:00,['2009/10/15 06:00'],"['2009/10/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/13 06:00 [medline]']","['1541-7786.MCR-09-0031 [pii]', '10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-09-0031 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Res. 2009 Oct;7(10):1693-703. doi: 10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-09-0031.

Many tumor cells express VEGF-R3 but the function of this receptor in tumor cells is largely unknown. It has been reported that the VEGF-C/VEGF-R3 axis is activated in subsets of leukemia patients. Herein, we have shown that VEGF-C induces angiogenic activity in the tube formation assay invitro and Matrigel plug assay in vivo by upregulating an angiogenic factor, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), through VEGF-R3 in the human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell line, THP-1. COX-2 induction by VEGF-C was also observed in other VEGF-R3(+) human AML cell lines (U937 and HL60). Moreover, immunohistochemical analysis of bone marrow specimens of 37 patients diagnosed with AML revealed that VEGF-C expression in specimens was associated with the expression of COX-2 (P < 0.001). The manner by which signaling pathways transduced by VEGF-C is responsible for COX-2 upregulation was further investigated. Blocking the p42/44 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway with the MAPK kinase inhibitor, PD 98059, failed to inhibit VEGF-C-mediated COX-2 expression. However, VEGF-C-induced COX-2 upregulation was effectively abolished by overexpression of dominant-negative c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) or treatment with the JNK inhibitor, SP 600125. VEGF-C induced JNK-dependent nuclear translocation of c-Jun. Furthermore, chromatin immunoprecipitation and reporter assays revealed that VEGF-C enhanced c-Jun binding to the cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate-response element of the COX-2 promoter and induced COX-2 expression. In sum, the data herein highlight the pathogenic role of VEGF-C in leukemia via regulation of angiogenesis through upregulation of COX-2.","['Chien, Ming-Hsien', 'Ku, Chia-Chi', 'Johansson, Gunnar', 'Chen, Min-Wei', 'Hsiao, Michael', 'Su, Jen-Liang', 'Inoue, Hiroyasu', 'Hua, Kuo-Tai', 'Wei, Lin-Hung', 'Kuo, Min-Liang']","['Chien MH', 'Ku CC', 'Johansson G', 'Chen MW', 'Hsiao M', 'Su JL', 'Inoue H', 'Hua KT', 'Wei LH', 'Kuo ML']","['Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Toxicology, Institute of Toxicology, College of Medicine and Angiogenesis Research Center, National Taiwan University, No. 1, Sec. 1, Ren-Ai Road, Taipei 10016, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Carcinogenesis,Carcinogenesis,8008055,,2009/10/15 06:00,2010/01/06 06:00,['2009/10/15 06:00'],"['2009/10/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/06 06:00 [medline]']","['bgp244 [pii]', '10.1093/carcin/bgp244 [doi]']",ppublish,Carcinogenesis. 2009 Dec;30(12):2005-13. doi: 10.1093/carcin/bgp244.,12,IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclooxygenase 2/*metabolism', 'Endothelial Cells/cytology', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry/methods', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 4/*metabolism', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System', '*Neovascularization, Pathologic', 'Transcription Factor AP-1/*metabolism', 'U937 Cells', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor C/*metabolism', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-3/*metabolism']",,"['0 (Transcription Factor AP-1)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor C)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (Cyclooxygenase 2)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-3)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 4)']",,,,['Carcinogenesis. 2010 May;31(5):953; author reply 954.

Six new cases of acute myeloid leukaemia were observed by prospectively following two Spanish series of 142 and 88 patients with worsening relapsing multiple sclerosis and secondary-progressive disease treated with mitoxantrone. A literature review shows 32 further cases of acute myeloid leukaemia reported, 65.6% of which are therapy-related acute promyelocytic leukaemia. Five cases in the cohorts fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for acute promyelocytic leukaemia, and one patient was diagnosed with pre-B-acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Acute myeloid leukaemia latency after mitoxantrone discontinuation was 1 to 45 months. The accumulated incidence and incidence density was 2.82% and 0.62%, respectively, in the Valencian cohort, and 2.27% and 0.44% in the Catalonian cohort. In the only seven previously reported series, the accumulated incidence varied from 0.15% to 0.80%. The real incidence of acute myeloid leukaemia after mitoxantrone therapy in the multiple sclerosis population could be higher as evidenced by the growing number of cases reported. Haematological monitoring should continue for at least 5 years after the last dose of mitoxantrone.

Laboratory data suggest that As(2)O(3) induces apoptosis of several solid tumor cells including lung cancer cells. Regions of tissue hypoxia often arise in aggressive solid tumors, and hypoxic tumors exhibit augmented invasiveness and metastatic ability in several malignancies. Furthermore, hypoxia may impair the treatment efficiency; therefore, we studied the cytotoxic effect of As(2)O(3) on human lung adenocarcinoma cell lines A549 and A549/R (resistant to vincristine, adriamycin and mitomycin etc.) grown under normoxic and hypoxic (1% oxygen) conditions. At both normoxia and hypoxia, 5, 10 and 15 microM As(2)O(3) induced evident growth inhibition and apoptosis in A549 cells as well as A549/R cells after 48 hours of exposure. In contrast, the conventional chemotherapeutic drug vincristine showed lowered efficiency in hypoxic A549 cells. As(2)O(3) induced G(2)/M cell cycle arrest in both normoxic and hypoxic A549 cells. As(2)O(3) significantly decreased the messenger RNA (mRNA) levels of Cyclin B(1) and survivin and the protein levels of Cyclin B(1), phospho-CDC(2) (Thr 161) and survivin in both normoxic and hypoxic A549 cells. Together, our findings indicated that As(2)O(3) significantly inhibited the proliferation of lung cancer cells via G(2)/M cell cycle arrest and induction of apoptosis at both normoxia and hypoxia, and the induction of apoptosis was associated with down regulation of survivin.","['Qu, Ge-ping', 'Xiu, Qing-Yu', 'Li, Bing', 'Liu, Yong-an', 'Zhang, Ling-Zhen']","['Qu GP', 'Xiu QY', 'Li B', 'Liu YA', 'Zhang LZ']","['Department of Respiratory Diseases, Changzheng Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Toxicol Ind Health,Toxicology and industrial health,8602702,,2009/10/15 06:00,2009/12/24 06:00,['2009/10/15 06:00'],"['2009/10/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/24 06:00 [medline]']","['25/8/505 [pii]', '10.1177/0748233709345936 [doi]']",ppublish,Toxicol Ind Health. 2009 Sep;25(8):505-15. doi: 10.1177/0748233709345936.,8,IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/*drug therapy', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'CDC2 Protein Kinase', 'Cell Cycle/*drug effects', 'Cell Hypoxia/*drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cyclin B/metabolism', 'Cyclin B1/metabolism', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases', 'Down-Regulation', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Cyclin B)', '0 (Cyclin B1)', '0 (Oxides)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDC2 Protein Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The data accumulated in the literature has largely been derived from studies conducted on Caucasian Western populations. Little is known about Asian CLL patients. In this study the IGHV genes usage and somatic hypermutation status have been investigated in 87 Iranian CLL patients. Based on a cut-off of 98% nucleotide sequence homology, 64.4% and 35.6% of the patients expressed mutated and unmutated IGHV genes, respectively, with most non-progressive patients being in the mutated group (35/44 vs 19/40; P = 0.009). Progression-free survival (PFS) and time to first treatment (TTFT) were significantly higher in our mutated and non-progressive patients compared to unmutated and progressive subtypes, respectively. The most frequently used IGHV gene was IGHV3-7 (12.6%) followed by IGHV3-30 (11.4%), IGHV3-48 (9.2%), IGHV4-39 (6.9%), and IGHV1-8 (6.9%) genes, which taken together comprised nearly half of the IGHV genes expressed in the Iranian CLL patients. Of the IGHV genes, IGHV3-7 was significantly over-represented in non-progressive compared to progressive CLL patients (P = 0.036), whereas IGHV1-69 and IGHV1-2 were expressed at a higher frequency in unmutated compared to mutated CLL patients (P < 0.03). Comparison of IGHV gene usage in our patients with that of Western CLL patients revealed significant differences in expression of IGHV1-69, IGHV3-7, IGHV3-21, and IGHV4-34 genes. Analysis of the IGHV third complementary determining region (HCDR3) sequences revealed a high frequency use of certain HCDR3 motifs, such as YYYGMDV, in our samples. These findings imply contribution of antigen selection and regional (ethnic/geographic) parameters in the leukomogenesis of CLL.","['Hojjat-Farsangi, Mohammad', 'Jeddi-Tehrani, Mahmood', 'Razavi, Seyed Mohsen', 'Sharifian, Ramazan Ali', 'Mellstedt, Hakan', 'Shokri, Fazel', 'Rabbani, Hodjatallah']","['Hojjat-Farsangi M', 'Jeddi-Tehrani M', 'Razavi SM', 'Sharifian RA', 'Mellstedt H', 'Shokri F', 'Rabbani H']","['Department of Immunology, School of Public Health, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090902,England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,,2009/10/15 06:00,2010/03/20 06:00,['2009/10/15 06:00'],"['2009/10/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/20 06:00 [medline]']","['CAS1341 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1349-7006.2009.01341.x [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2009 Dec;100(12):2346-53. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.2009.01341.x.

METHODS: Immunohistochemistry was used to detect LRP16 expression in 336 cases of paraffin-embedded gastric carcinoma tissues and 60 cases of distal normal mucosa. The relationships between LRP16 expression and patients' age, tumor size, histological grade, clinical stage, metastatic status and prognosis were analysed. RESULTS: The expression of LRP16 was 58.6% (197/336) in gastric carcinoma and 31.7% (19/60) in distal normal gastric mucosa. The expression of LRP16 in carcinoma was significantly higher than that in normal mucosa tissues (chi(2) = 14.929, P = 0.001). LRP16 protein expression was found in 44.1% (63/143) carcinomas at stage I and II, and 69.4% (134/193) carcinomas at stage III and IV (chi(2) = 21.804, P = 0.001), and in 56.9% (182/320) of cancers without metastasis but 93.8% (15/16) of those with metastasis (chi(2) = 8.543, P = 0.003). The expression of LRP16 was correlated with tumor size, infiltrative depth, clinical stage, lymphatic invasion and distant metastasis (all P < 0.05). Follow-up data showed that there was a significant difference in median survival time between cancer patients with expression of LRP16 (27.0 mo) and those without (48.0 mo, Log rank =31.644, P = 0.001). CONCLUSION: The expression of LRP16 may be associated with invasion, metastasis and prognosis of gastric cancer.","['Li, Ya-Zhuo', 'Zhao, Po', 'Han, Wei-Dong']","['Li YZ', 'Zhao P', 'Han WD']","[""Department of Pathology, Chinese People's Liberation Army General Hospital, Beijing, China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,World J Gastroenterol,World journal of gastroenterology,100883448,PMC2761564,2009/10/14 06:00,2010/01/28 06:00,['2009/10/14 06:00'],"['2009/10/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3748/wjg.15.4833 [doi]'],ppublish,World J Gastroenterol. 2009 Oct 14;15(38):4833-7. doi: 10.3748/wjg.15.4833.,38,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Carboxylic Ester Hydrolases', 'Carcinoma/*metabolism/mortality', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry/methods', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Prognosis', 'Stomach Neoplasms/*metabolism/mortality', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', 'EC 3.1.1.- (Carboxylic Ester Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.1.1.- (MACROD1 protein, human)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the efficacy of NK cell-mediated tumor cell lysis is limited due to target cell resistance, and target cell-induced apoptosis (TiA) was proposed to contribute to differences in susceptibility to NK cells. Here we analyzed the effects of target cells on the apoptosis of cytokine-activated NK cells in vitro. We found no association of target cell susceptibility and TiA of NK cells in an array of human and murine target-effector cell combinations. Incubation of NK cells with caspase inhibitors blocked TiA incompletely, indicating that TiA is partly based on caspase-independent mechanisms. Modulating NK cell susceptibility against TiA by caspase inhibition did not influence cytotoxic efficacy. Furthermore, we found cytotoxic potential of NK cells to be markedly decreased following first target cell contact. Exhaustion of NK cell activity by first target cell contact was, however, not mediated by TiA. In addition, we found no relevant TiA by lymphoma cell lines against activated murine NK cells.

Current thinking holds that BCR-ABL forms a multi-protein complex that incorporates several substrates and adaptor proteins and is stabilized by multiple direct and indirect interactions. Signaling output from this highly redundant network leads to cellular transformation. Proteins known to be associated with BCR-ABL in this complex include: GRB2, c-CBL, p62(DOK), and CRKL. These proteins in turn, link BCR-ABL to various signaling pathways indicated in cellular transformation. In this study we show that a triple mutant of BCR-ABL with mutations of the direct binding sites for GRB2, CBL, p62(DOK) and CRKL, is defective for transformation of primary hematopoietic cells in vitro and in a murine CML model, while it retains the capacity to induce IL-3 independence in 32D cells. Compared to BCR-ABL, the triple mutant's ability to activate the MAP kinase and PI3-kinase pathways is severely compromised, while STAT5 phosphorylation is maintained, suggesting that the former are crucial for the transformation of primary cells, but dispensable for transformation of factor dependent cell lines. Our data suggest that inhibition of BCR-ABL-induced leukemia by disrupting protein interactions could be possible, but would require blocking of multiple sites.","['Johnson, Kara J', 'Griswold, Ian J', ""O'Hare, Thomas"", 'Corbin, Amie S', 'Loriaux, Marc', 'Deininger, Michael W', 'Druker, Brian J']","['Johnson KJ', 'Griswold IJ', ""O'Hare T"", 'Corbin AS', 'Loriaux M', 'Deininger MW', 'Druker BJ']","['Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Oregon Health & Science University Knight Cancer Institute, Portland, Oregon, United States of America. johnskar@ohsu.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091013,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,PMC2757918,2009/10/14 06:00,2010/03/13 06:00,['2009/10/14 06:00'],"['2009/03/26 00:00 [received]', '2009/09/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/10/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1371/journal.pone.0007439 [doi]'],epublish,PLoS One. 2009 Oct 13;4(10):e7439. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0007439.,10,IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'GRB2 Adaptor Protein/metabolism', 'Interleukin-3/metabolism', 'Leukemia/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-cbl/metabolism', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction']",,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (CRKL protein)', '0 (GRB2 Adaptor Protein)', '0 (Grb2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-cbl)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 6.3.2.- (Cbl protein, mouse)']",,,"['R01 CA065823/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HHMI/Howard Hughes Medical Institute/United States', 'R01 CA65823/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Moreover, AZD1152 synergistically enhanced the effects of vincristine (VCR) to induce growth arrest of these cells.

Apogossypolone (ApoG2) is an analogue of (-)-gossypol, exhibiting binding activity with Ki values of 35 nmol/L for Bcl-2 and 25 nmol/L for Mcl-1. The present study was designed to test our hypothesis whether inactivation of Bcl-2 family of proteins using ApoG2 could sensitize pancreatic cancer cells to the cytotoxic effect of gemcitabine. METHODS: Two pancreatic cancer cell lines were treated with ApoG2, gemcitabine, and their combination; cytotoxicity and apoptosis was confirmed by MTT and histone/DNA enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments were performed to elucidate the mechanism of action of ApoG2. In vivo efficacy of ApoG2 was evaluated in a xenograft model to confirm its therapeutic benefit with gemcitabine. RESULTS: When ApoG2 was combined with gemcitabine, increased cytotoxicity and apoptosis was evident. Coimmunoprecipitation experiment revealed that ApoG2 blocks the heterodimerization of Mcl-1/Bax and Bcl-2/Bim in cells. Furthermore, administration of ApoG2 with gemcitabine resulted in a statistically higher antitumor activity compared with either ApoG2 or gemcitabine alone in a severe combined immunodeficiency mouse xenograft model. CONCLUSIONS: Apogossypolone, which functions as a potent pan-Bcl-2 family inhibitor, seems therapeutically promising for future translational studies including the treatment of pancreatic cancer.","['Banerjee, Sanjeev', 'Choi, Minsig', 'Aboukameel, Amro', 'Wang, Zhiwei', 'Mohammad, Mussop', 'Chen, Jianyong', 'Yang, Dajun', 'Sarkar, Fazlul H', 'Mohammad, Ramzi M']","['Banerjee S', 'Choi M', 'Aboukameel A', 'Wang Z', 'Mohammad M', 'Chen J', 'Yang D', 'Sarkar FH', 'Mohammad RM']","['Division of Pathology, Karmanos Cancer Institute, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, MI 48201, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,Pancreas,Pancreas,8608542,PMC3807128,2009/10/14 06:00,2010/07/09 06:00,['2009/10/14 06:00'],"['2009/10/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/MPA.0b013e3181bb95e7 [doi]'],ppublish,Pancreas. 2010 Apr;39(3):323-31. doi: 10.1097/MPA.0b013e3181bb95e7.,3,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', '*Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Deoxycytidine/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Synergism', 'Female', 'Gossypol/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Membrane Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Pancreatic Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/antagonists & inhibitors']",,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BCL2L11 protein, human)', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (Bcl2l11 protein, mouse)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (apogossypolone)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0W860991D6 (Deoxycytidine)', 'B76N6SBZ8R (gemcitabine)', 'KAV15B369O (Gossypol)']",,,['R01 CA109389/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,['NIHMS512774'],,,,,,,,,,

We examined whether inhibition of BCL-2 family function could restore Lapatinib toxicity in Lapatinib adapted tumor cells and enhance Lapatinib toxicity in naive cells. The BCL-2 family antagonist Obatoclax (GX15-070), that inhibits BCL-2/BCL-X(L)/MCL-1 function, enhanced Lapatinib toxicity in parental HCT116 and Lapatinib adapted HCT116 cells. In breast cancer lines, regardless of elevated ERBB1/2 expression, GX15-070 enhanced Lapatinib toxicity within 3-12 h. The promotion of Lapatinib toxicity neither correlated with cleavage of caspase 3 nor was blocked by inhibition caspases; and was not associated with changes in the activities of ERK1/2, JNK1/2 or p38 MAPK but with reduced AKT, mTOR and S6K1 phosphorylation. The promotion of Lapatinib toxicity by GX15-070 correlated with increased cytosolic levels of apoptosis inducing factor (AIF) and expression of ATG8 (LC3), and the formation of large vesicles that intensely stained for a transfected LC3-GFP construct. Knock down of the autophagy regulatory proteins ATG5 or Beclin1 suppressed the induction of LC3-GFP vesicularization and significantly reduced cell killing, whereas knock down of MCL-1 and BCL-X(L) enhanced the induction of LC3-GFP vesicularization and significantly enhanced cell killing. Knockdown of Beclin1 and AIF abolished cell killing. Collectively, our data demonstrate that Obatoclax mediated inhibition of MCL-1 rapidly enhances Lapatinib toxicity in tumor cells via a toxic form of autophagy and via AIF release from the mitochondrion.","['Martin, Aditi Pandya', 'Mitchell, Clint', 'Rahmani, Mohamed', 'Nephew, Kenneth P', 'Grant, Steven', 'Dent, Paul']","['Martin AP', 'Mitchell C', 'Rahmani M', 'Nephew KP', 'Grant S', 'Dent P']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091121,United States,Cancer Biol Ther,Cancer biology & therapy,101137842,PMC3887451,2009/10/14 06:00,2010/06/26 06:00,['2009/10/14 06:00'],"['2009/10/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/26 06:00 [medline]']","['9895 [pii]', '10.4161/cbt.8.21.9895 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Biol Ther. 2009 Nov;8(21):2084-96. doi: 10.4161/cbt.8.21.9895.

Specific targeting of CSCs but not normal stem cell counterparts is a correct strategy for developing new anti-cancer therapies, and the success of this approach relies on identification of specific target genes in CSCs. Using BCR-ABL-induced chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) as a cancer model, we recently identified arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) gene (Alox5) as a critical regulator for leukemia stem cells (LSCs) in CML. Without Alox5, BCR-ABL fails to induce CML in mice due to the impairments of the functions of LSCs. The lack of Alox5 does not significantly affect the functions of normal hematopoietic stem cells. In addition, Zileuton, a specific 5-LO inhibitor, also causes the impairments of the functions of LSCs in a similar manner. Our results prove the principle that CSC-specific genes that play key roles in cancer development can be identified and inhibition of these genes can lead to eradication of these cells for cure. Here, we further discuss the mechanisms of Alox5 in CML, and the use of Zileuton as a potential and promising drug in eradicating LSCs in CML and other myeloproliferative diseases. We believe that our discovery of the role of Alox5 in regulating the function of LSCs in CML reminds us of viewing CSCs at a different angel. We predict that CSCs in other types of cancer also utilize specific regulatory pathways to control their survival and self-renewal, and inhibition of these pathways profoundly suppresses CSCs but not their normal stem cell counterparts. Specific targeting of CSCs without causing significant harm to normal stem cells should be a correct direction to go in developing novel therapeutic strategies in the future.","['Chen, Yaoyu', 'Li, Dongguang', 'Li, Shaoguang']","['Chen Y', 'Li D', 'Li S']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20091119,United States,Cell Cycle,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,,2009/10/14 06:00,2010/02/02 06:00,['2009/10/14 06:00'],"['2009/10/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/02 06:00 [medline]']","['9852 [pii]', '10.4161/cc.8.21.9852 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Cycle. 2009 Nov 1;8(21):3488-92. doi: 10.4161/cc.8.21.9852.

Historical practice at the Izaak Walton Killam Health Centre (IWK) involves measuring AT and FG levels after ASP administration and transfusing fresh-frozen plasma (FFP) or cryoprecipitate (CRY) to prevent thrombotic and hemorrhagic complications. To determine whether this reduced these complications in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), incidence, outcome, and clinical characteristics of ASP-related CNST in ALL patients at IWK were compared with a similar cohort from BC Children's Hospital (BCCH), where prophylaxis was not performed. Costs associated with preventative versus expectant management were estimated. From 1990 to 2005, 240 patients were treated at IWK and 479 at BCCH. Seven BCCH patients developed venous CNST (1.5%), compared with none at IWK. CNST occurred exclusively during induction. Six patients received anticoagulation and continued ASP. All 7 patients remain in remission. National Cancer Institute high-risk ALL predicted CNST risk (P = .02), whereas sex, age, race, and body mass index did not. Neither FFP nor CRY protected against CNST, suggesting prophylaxis is unwarranted for unselected ALL patients.

In 10 patients, dominant engraftment of a single donor unit emerged by day 28 after CBT. In 9 of these 10 patients, a significant subset of CD8(+) CD45RO(+/-)CCR7(-) T cells, present in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and derived from the engrafting cord blood unit, produced interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) in response to the nonengrafting unit.

Three patients maintained persistent mixed chimerism after CBT, and no significant IFN-gamma-secreting cells were detected after similar stimulations in these patients (P < .005).

In a phase 2 study, 73 early chronic-phase, untreated, Ph(+) CML patients, received nilotinib at a dose of 400 mg twice daily. The primary endpoint was the complete cytogenetic response (CCgR) rate at 1 year. With a median follow-up of 15 months, the CCgR rate at 1 year was 96%, and the major molecular response rate 85%. Responses were rapid, with 78% CCgR and 52% major molecular response at 3 months. During the first year, the treatment was interrupted at least once in 38 patients (52%). The mean daily dose ranged between 600 and 800 mg in 74% of patients, 400 and 599 mg in 18% of patients, and was less than 400 mg in 8% of patients. Dose interruptions were mainly due to nonhematologic and biochemical side effects. Myelosuppression was irrelevant. One patient progressed to blastic crisis after 6 months; one went off-treatment for lipase increase grade 4 (no pancreatitis). Nilotinib is safe and very active in early chronic-phase CML.

The authors examined body size measurements and recreational physical activity in relation to risk of B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) in the prospective California Teachers Study.

Multivariable-adjusted relative risks and 95% confidence intervals were estimated by fitting Cox proportional hazards models for all B-cell NHL combined and for the 3 most common subtypes: diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, and B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma. Height was positively associated with risk of all B-cell NHLs (for >1.70 vs. 1.61-1.65 m, relative risk = 1.50, 95% confidence interval: 1.16, 1.96) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (relative risk = 1.93, 95% confidence interval: 1.09, 3.41). Weight and body mass index at age 18 years were positive predictors of B-cell NHL risk overall. These findings indicate that greater height, which may reflect genetics, early life immune function, infectious exposures, nutrition, or growth hormone levels, may play a role in NHL etiology.

Low-dose ATO can effectively alleviate acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). However, it is quite challenging in treating solid tumors. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of ATO at low concentrations on the metastatic potential of mouse hepatoma H(22) cells and the anti-metastatic mechanism of ATO. METHODS: The metastatic potential of H(22) cells was evaluated by adhesion, migration and invasion assays after exposure to a low dose of ATO in vitro. The mouse lung metastatic model induced by injection of H(22) cells via the tail vein was adopted for the evaluation of metastatic potential. Different proteins in the lysate of H(22) cells exposed to ATO at different concentrations were investigated by surface-enhanced laser desorption and ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (SELDI-TOF-MS). Finally, Western blotting analyses were made to detect the expression pattern of MMP-2 and nm23-M1 proteins. RESULTS: Significant cell death started at ATO concentrations above 2 micromol/L. The growth and adhesion potential of H(22) cells was inhibited in a time- and dose-dependent manner, and the migration and invasion potential of H(22) cells was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner while ATO concentration was below 2 micromol/L. Mice injected with ATO at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg had fewer lung metastases. However, mice injected with ATO at a dose of 2 mg/kg or 4 mg/kg had a high mortality rate and more liver injuries. A total of 15 different protein peaks were identified between the lysate of H(22) cells treated with ATO and controls. Two proteins that peaked at m/z 5302 and 17207 coincided with MMP-2 (fragment) and nm23-M1, respectively. Western blotting analyses demonstrated that MMP-2 and MMP-2 fragments were down-regulated and nm23-M1 was up-regulated in H(22) cells treated with 2 micromol/L ATO for 48 hours. CONCLUSIONS: ATO at a low dose inhibits the metastatic potential of mouse hepatoma H(22) cells in vitro and in vivo, and involves down-regulation of MMP-2 and up-regulation of nm23-M1.","['Zhao, Xian-Shu', 'Song, Peng-Long', 'Sun, Bei', 'Jiang, Hong-Chi', 'Liu, Tie-Fu']","['Zhao XS', 'Song PL', 'Sun B', 'Jiang HC', 'Liu TF']","['Department of Gastroenterology, Fourth Affiliated Hospital, Harbin Medical University, Harbin 150010, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Singapore,Hepatobiliary Pancreat Dis Int,Hepatobiliary & pancreatic diseases international : HBPD INT,101151457,,2009/10/14 06:00,2010/03/02 06:00,['2009/10/14 06:00'],"['2009/10/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/02 06:00 [medline]']",['1279 [pii]'],ppublish,Hepatobiliary Pancreat Dis Int. 2009 Oct;8(5):510-7.,5,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/*pharmacology', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/adverse effects/*pharmacology', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/metabolism/*pathology', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement/*drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Liver Neoplasms/metabolism/*pathology', 'Lung Neoplasms/prevention & control/secondary', 'Male', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 2/metabolism', 'Mice', 'NM23 Nucleoside Diphosphate Kinases/metabolism', 'Oxides/adverse effects/*pharmacology', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization']",,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (NM23 Nucleoside Diphosphate Kinases)', '0 (Oxides)', 'EC 2.7.4.6 (Nme1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.4.24.24 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 2)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We previously reported similar, but not equivalent, outcomes of URD versus sibling donor HCT for CML using an older, less precise classification of HLA matching. Here, we used our recently refined HLA-matching classification, which is suitable for interpretation when complete allele-level typing is unavailable, to reanalyze outcomes of previous HCT for CML. We found that using our new matching criteria identifies substantially more frequent mismatching than older, less precise ""6 of 6 antigen-matched"" URD-HCT. Under the new criteria, only 37% of those previously deemed ""HLA- matched"" were HLA well matched, and 44% were partially matched. Using our refined matching criteria confirms the greater risk of graft failure in partially matched or mismatched URD-recipient pairs compared with either sibling or well-matched URD-recipient pairs. Acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD, cGVHD) are significantly more frequent with all levels of recategorized URD HLA matching. Importantly, overall survival (OS) and leukemia-free survival (LFS) remain significantly worse after URD-HCT at any matching level. No augmented GVL effect accompanied URD HLA mismatch. Compared with sibling donor transplants, we observed only marginally increased (not statistically significant) risks of relapse in well-matched, partially matched, and mismatched URD-HCT. These data confirm the applicability of revised HLA-matching scheme in analyzing retrospective data sets when fully informative, allele-level typing is unavailable. In this analysis, greater histoincompatibility can augment GVHD, but does not improve protection against relapse; thus the best donor remains the most closely matched donor.","['Weisdorf, Daniel J', 'Nelson, Gene', 'Lee, Stephanie J', 'Haagenson, Michael', 'Spellman, Stephen', 'Antin, Joseph H', 'Bolwell, Brian', 'Cahn, Jean-Yves', 'Cervantes, Francisco', 'Copelan, Edward', 'Gale, Robert', 'Gratwohl, Alois', 'Khoury, H Jean', 'McCarthy, Philip', 'Marks, David I', 'Szer, Jeff', 'Woolfrey, Ann', 'Cortes-Franco, Jorge', 'Horowitz, Mary M', 'Arora, Mukta']","['Weisdorf DJ', 'Nelson G', 'Lee SJ', 'Haagenson M', 'Spellman S', 'Antin JH', 'Bolwell B', 'Cahn JY', 'Cervantes F', 'Copelan E', 'Gale R', 'Gratwohl A', 'Khoury HJ', 'McCarthy P', 'Marks DI', 'Szer J', 'Woolfrey A', 'Cortes-Franco J', 'Horowitz MM', 'Arora M']","['University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55455, USA. weisd001@umn.edu']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",20090819,United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,PMC2929002,2009/10/14 06:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/10/14 06:00'],"['2009/04/06 00:00 [received]', '2009/06/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/10/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S1083-8791(09)00304-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbmt.2009.06.016 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2009 Nov;15(11):1475-8. doi: 10.1016/j.bbmt.2009.06.016.

To improve the outcome of allo-HSCT for refractory leukemia, we investigated the strategy of sequential intensified conditioning and early rapid tapering of prophylactic immunosuppressants therapy for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) during the early stage after transplantation. A total of 51 patients with refractory leukemia (median age, 30.0 years; unfavorable karyotypes, 49%) received fludarabine (Flu) 30 mg/m(2)/day and cytarabine 2 g/m(2)/day (on days -10 to -6), 4.5 Gy total body irradiation (TBI)/day (on days -5 and -4), and cyclophosphamide (Cy) 60 mg/kg/day and etoposide 600 mg/day (on days -3 and -2) for conditioning. Cyclosporine A (CsA) was withdrawn rapidly in a stepwise fashion to avoid overwhelming GVHD reactions if acute GVHD (aGVHD) did not develop at day +30. All 51 patients developed regimen-related toxicities (13 with grade III-IV); 93.9% of them achieved complete remission by day +30. Median follow-up was 41 months (range, 6.6 to 92.2 months); 5-year overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were 44.6% +/- 8.1% and 38.2% +/- 7.7%, respectively. Thirteen patients relapsed; the 3-year cumulative incidence of leukemia relapse was 33.3%. On multivariate analysis, cytogenetic status was the only significant pretransplantation factor. Survival was better in patients with grade I or II aGVHD than in those without aGVHD. Our data indicate that the sequential strategy of cytoreductive chemotherapy followed immediately by intensified myeloablative (MA) conditioning for allo-HSCT and rapid tapering of prophylactic immunosuppressants for GVHD in the early stage after transplantation has an acceptable toxicity profile and may be a better approach to treating refractory leukemia.","['Liu, Qi-Fa', 'Fan, Zhi-Ping', 'Zhang, Yu', 'Jiang, Zu-Jun', 'Wang, Chun-Yan', 'Xu, Dan', 'Sun, Jing', 'Xiao, Yang', 'Tan, Huo']","['Liu QF', 'Fan ZP', 'Zhang Y', 'Jiang ZJ', 'Wang CY', 'Xu D', 'Sun J', 'Xiao Y', 'Tan H']","['Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510515, China. liuqifa@fimmu.com']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20090819,United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,,2009/10/14 06:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/10/14 06:00'],"['2009/05/12 00:00 [received]', '2009/06/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/10/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S1083-8791(09)00303-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbmt.2009.06.017 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2009 Nov;15(11):1376-85. doi: 10.1016/j.bbmt.2009.06.017.

As a potent pro-inflammatory and antitumor cytokine, IFN-gamma is conventionally thought to be responsible for driving cellular immune response. On the other hand, accumulating evidence suggests that IFN-gamma also has immunosuppressive activity. An important role for IFN-gamma in inhibiting graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) has been demonstrated in murine models, despite IFN-gamma being one of the key factors amplifying T cell activation during the process of acute GVHD (aGVHD), the major complication and cause of post-transplant mortality in allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT). At the same time, IFN-gamma facilitates graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) activity. Dissociation of GVL effects from GVHD has been the ultimate goal of allogeneic BMT in the treatment of hematologic malignancies. This paradoxic role of IFN-gamma makes modulating its activity a promising strategy to maximize GVL while minimizing GVHD and improve clinical outcomes in BMT.

Together with epigenetic alterations, these result in dysplasia, clonal expansion, and ultimately myeloid leukemia. Combinations of lesions are required to induce overt leukemia. Altering a small subset of signaling pathways leads to disruption of normal self-renewal, proliferation, differentiation, and apoptotic mechanisms that control the development of hematopoietic stem cells and their differentiation into mature effector cells. Recent studies have shown that cytogenetically normal (CN-) AML is quite heterogeneous at the molecular level. Patients with CN-AML harboring mutations in NPM1, FLT3, CEBPA, WT1 or expressing high levels of BAALC, ERG, or MN1 have distinctly different clinical outcomes. NPM1 mutations are independently associated with higher remission rates and longer disease-free and overall survival in AML. Copy number alterations (CNAs) are deletions or amplifications of single genes. CNAs have been found at the breakpoints of known chromosomal translocations. Fewer CNAs have been detected in AML than in pediatric ALL. Micro-RNAs (miRs) are non-coding small RNA molecules containing about 22 nucleotides that are typically encoded within introns. They hybridize to complementary mRNA targets and modulate protein expression by inhibiting translation and/or inducing degradation of target messenger RNAs. This new class of genes has recently been shown to play a pivotal role in malignant transformation. miRs are down-regulated in many tumors and thus appear to function as tumor suppressor genes. Distinctive genome-wide miR expression profiles have been associated with different subsets of AML. A miR signature that is associated with clinical outcome in patients with high-risk molecular features of AML (those who have FLT3-ITD or wild-type NPM1) has been reported. This subgroup constitutes approximately 65% of patients with CN-AML and one-third of all patients with AML <60 years old. Down-regulation of the miR-181 family contributes to an aggressive leukemia phenotype through mechanisms associated with the activation of pathways of innate immunity mediated by toll-like receptors and interleukin-1beta.","['Larson, Richard A']",['Larson RA'],"['Section of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637, USA. rlarson@medicine.bsd.uchicago.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20091012,Ireland,Chem Biol Interact,Chemico-biological interactions,0227276,PMC2846194,2009/10/14 06:00,2010/04/24 06:00,['2009/10/14 06:00'],"['2009/09/10 00:00 [received]', '2009/10/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/10/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/24 06:00 [medline]']","['S0009-2797(09)00431-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cbi.2009.10.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Chem Biol Interact. 2010 Mar 19;184(1-2):21-5. doi: 10.1016/j.cbi.2009.10.002.

The aim of the study was in vitro characterization of the anticancer activity of betulin in a range of human tumour cell lines (neuroblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma-medulloblastoma, glioma, thyroid, breast, lung and colon carcinoma, leukaemia and multiple myeloma), and in primary tumour cultures isolated from patients (ovarian carcinoma, cervical carcinoma and glioblastoma multiforme). In this study, we demonstrated a remarkable anti-proliferative effect of betulin in all tested tumour cell cultures. Neuroblastoma (SK-N-AS) and colon carcinoma (HT-29) were the most sensitive to the anti-proliferative effect of betulin. Furthermore, betulin altered tumour cells morphology, decreased their motility and induced apoptotic cell death. These findings demonstrate the anti-cancer potential of betulin and suggest that they may be applied as an adjunctive measure in cancer treatment.","['Rzeski, Wojciech', 'Stepulak, Andrzej', 'Szymanski, Marek', 'Juszczak, Malgorzata', 'Grabarska, Aneta', 'Sifringer, Marco', 'Kaczor, Jozef', 'Kandefer-Szerszen, Martyna']","['Rzeski W', 'Stepulak A', 'Szymanski M', 'Juszczak M', 'Grabarska A', 'Sifringer M', 'Kaczor J', 'Kandefer-Szerszen M']","['Department of Virology and Immunology, Maria Curie-Sklodowska University, Lublin, Poland. rzeskiw@hektor.umcs.lublin.pl']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20091012,England,Basic Clin Pharmacol Toxicol,Basic & clinical pharmacology & toxicology,101208422,,2009/10/14 06:00,2010/03/03 06:00,['2009/10/14 06:00'],"['2009/10/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/03 06:00 [medline]']","['PTO471 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1742-7843.2009.00471.x [doi]']",ppublish,Basic Clin Pharmacol Toxicol. 2009 Dec;105(6):425-32. doi: 10.1111/j.1742-7843.2009.00471.x.

Compared to standard indications for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), cytopenia further increases the risks of infection and bleeding. We describe the use of ECMO in four children with ARDS and leukaemia. Two patients (50%) survived, pulmonary function recovered and they are in prolonged first remission. The two other patients died from ARDS and pulmonary leukaemic infiltration. Although ECMO support is a high-risk setup for nosocomial infection we observed no additional septic episodes. All patients had a highly increased demand for packed platelet and red blood cell transfusions. This increased demand and unmanageable chronic bleeding into both lungs in one patient were probably caused by a combination of coagulopathy from the primary illness, the use of anticoagulants, chemotherapy-induced cytopenia, and a reduced survival rate of platelets and red cells due to permanent contact to foreign surface. We concluded that ECMO is a supportive tool to reduce the incidence of early death, treatment-related mortality and, ultimately, to improve overall survival in childhood leukaemia.","['Meister, Bernhard', 'Zelger, Bettina', 'Kropshofer, Gabriele', 'Klein-Franke, Andreas', 'Crazzolara, Roman', 'Fruhwirth, Martin', 'Neu, Nikolaus']","['Meister B', 'Zelger B', 'Kropshofer G', 'Klein-Franke A', 'Crazzolara R', 'Fruhwirth M', 'Neu N']","['Division of Paediatrics II, Department of Paediatrics, Paediatric Intensive Care Unit, Medical University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria. bernhard.meister@i-med.ac.at']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20091011,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,2009/10/14 06:00,2010/04/07 06:00,['2009/10/14 06:00'],"['2009/10/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/07 06:00 [medline]']","['BJH7924 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2009.07924.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2010 Jan;148(1):126-31. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2009.07924.x.

Because such elements are essential components of the ALL-BFM (Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster) protocols, we evaluated whether TLX3+ T-ALL patients benefit from this type of therapy. Thirty-one/131 childhood T-ALL cases (24%) enrolled into four population-based Austrian ALL-BFM therapy studies were TLX3+. The male to female ratio was 3.5:1 and median age and leucocyte count at diagnosis were 8.7 years and 58.9 x 10(9)/l, respectively. Twenty-four patients (77%) were good responders to prednisone. All were in complete remission after induction therapy. After a median observation time of 4.9 years (range 0.4-16.1 years) 28/31 TLX3+ cases remained in first complete remission after chemotherapy with one after additional stem cell transplantation. Although molecular disease was frequently present after a 4-drug induction therapy, final treatment outcome was excellent indicating that TLX3+ T-ALL cases may benefit from a BFM-type of ALL therapy with early and late re-intensification elements. Moreover, the fact that 2/3 relapses were also NUP214-ABL1+ suggests that these cases might represent the particular risk-prone TLX3+ subgroup that could benefit from a targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy.","['Attarbaschi, Andishe', 'Pisecker, Markus', 'Inthal, Andrea', 'Mann, Georg', 'Janousek, Dasa', 'Dworzak, Michael', 'Potschger, Ulrike', 'Ullmann, Reinhard', 'Schrappe, Martin', 'Gadner, Helmut', 'Haas, Oskar A', 'Panzer-Grumayer, Renate', 'Strehl, Sabine']","['Attarbaschi A', 'Pisecker M', 'Inthal A', 'Mann G', 'Janousek D', 'Dworzak M', 'Potschger U', 'Ullmann R', 'Schrappe M', 'Gadner H', 'Haas OA', 'Panzer-Grumayer R', 'Strehl S']","[""Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, St. Anna Children's Hospital, Vienna, Austria.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091011,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,2009/10/14 06:00,2010/05/12 06:00,['2009/10/14 06:00'],"['2009/10/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/12 06:00 [medline]']","['BJH7944 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2009.07944.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2010 Jan;148(2):293-300. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2009.07944.x.

Patients received 500, 750, 1000 or 2500 U/m(2) PEG-asparaginase on up to nine occasions. Serum samples were analysed for asparaginase activity and data analysis was done using nonlinear mixed effects modelling (NONMEM Vers. VI, Globomax, Hanouet, MD, USA). Different linear and nonlinear models were tested. The best model applicable to all dosing groups was a one-compartmental model with clearance (Cl) increasing with time according to the formula: Cl=Cl(i) *e((0.0793 *t)) where Cl(i) = initial clearance and t = time after dose. The parameters found were: volume of distribution (V) 1.02 +/- 26% l/m(2), Cl(i) 59.9 +/- 59% ml/d per m(2) (mean +/- interindividual variability). Interoccasion variability was substantial with 0.183 l/m(2) for V and 44.7 ml/d per m(2) for Cl, respectively. A subgroup of the patients showed a high clearance, probably due to the development of inactivating antibodies. This is the first model able to predict the activity-time course of PEG-asparaginase at different dosing levels and can therefore be used for developing new dosing regimens.","['Hempel, Georg', 'Muller, Hans-Joachim', 'Lanvers-Kaminsky, Claudia', 'Wurthwein, Gudrun', 'Hoppe, Antje', 'Boos, Joachim']","['Hempel G', 'Muller HJ', 'Lanvers-Kaminsky C', 'Wurthwein G', 'Hoppe A', 'Boos J']","['Institut fur Pharmazeutische und Medizinische Chemie - Klinische Pharmazie-, Westfalische Wilhelms-Universitat Munster, Germany. georg.hempel@uni-muenster.de']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20091011,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,2009/10/14 06:00,2010/04/07 06:00,['2009/10/14 06:00'],"['2009/10/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/07 06:00 [medline]']","['BJH7923 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2009.07923.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2010 Jan;148(1):119-25. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2009.07923.x.

Fifty-two received fludarabine/melphalan, 44 received fludarabine/busulfan, and 24 received clofarabine/melphalan in addition to alemtuzumab. Post-transplant GVHD prophylaxis consisted of tacrolimus. No prophylactic donor lymphocyte infusion or other interventions were used for mixed donor chimerism (MDC). Bone marrow (BM) and/or peripheral blood (PB) samples were obtained at 30 days, 100 days, 180 days, and 1 year following HCT. On Day 30, 15% of assessable patients had MDC in the CD3 compartment. This had increased to 50% by Day 100, and to 63% by Day 180. MDC predicted for a lower risk of acute (p = 0.08) and particularly of chronic GVHD (p = 0.01). MDC was not associated with subsequent relapse or TRM (p = 0.67 and 0.72, respectively). A decline of more than 15% in CD3 chimerism between Day 30 and Day 180 predicted for a 40% risk of subsequent disease recurrence. The observation of MDC after alemtuzumab conditioning does not by itself constitute a risk factor for relapse and should not be used to guide therapeutic intervention. By contrast, declining donor chimerism between Day 30 and Day 180 is associated with a somewhat increased risk of disease recurrence. The high incidence of MDC after alemtuzumab containing conditioning contributes to the low risk of acute and chronic GVHD.","['van Besien, Koen', 'Dew, Alexander', 'Lin, Shang', 'Joseph, Loren', 'Godley, Lucy A', 'Larson, Richard A', 'Odenike, Toyosi', 'Rich, Elizabeth', 'Stock, Wendy', 'Wickrema, Amittha', 'Artz, Andrew S']","['van Besien K', 'Dew A', 'Lin S', 'Joseph L', 'Godley LA', 'Larson RA', 'Odenike T', 'Rich E', 'Stock W', 'Wickrema A', 'Artz AS']","['Section of Hematology/Oncology, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637, USA. kvbesien@uchicago.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,2009/10/14 06:00,2010/02/03 06:00,['2009/10/14 06:00'],"['2009/10/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/03 06:00 [medline]']","['10.3109/10428190903200790 [pii]', '10.3109/10428190903200790 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2009 Nov;50(11):1809-17. doi: 10.3109/10428190903200790.,11,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Alemtuzumab', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*administration & dosage', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/*administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'CD3 Complex/blood', 'Graft vs Host Disease/diagnosis/prevention & control', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/blood/therapy', 'Lymphoma/blood/therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Tacrolimus/administration & dosage', 'Time Factors', '*Transplantation Chimera', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '3A189DH42V (Alemtuzumab)', 'WM0HAQ4WNM (Tacrolimus)']",,,['K24 CA116471/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

The marked improvement of its clinical efficacy requires a 'better' target antigen, which is well recognized by cancer-cell-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes. We have recently demonstrated the potential of Aurora-A kinase (Aurora-A) as such a 'better' target for cellular immunotherapy against human leukemia. Aurora-A is a member of the serine/threonine kinase family that properly regulates the cell division process, and has recently been implicated in tumorigenesis. On the other hand, small-molecule inhibitors targeting Aurora-A have recently been developed and preliminary but promising observations from Phase I clinical trials have been reported. These facts highlight the attractiveness of Aurora-A as an important target of comprehensive cancer therapies. OBJECTIVE/METHODS: In this review, we cover Aurora-A in the areas of immunotherapy and small-molecule inhibitor therapy against cancers. RESULTS/CONCLUSIONS: Aurora-A kinase is an attractive molecule not only as a target for small-molecule inhibitors, but also as a potential target for immunotherapy against cancer.","['Ochi, Toshiki', 'Fujiwara, Hiroshi', 'Yasukawa, Masaki']","['Ochi T', 'Fujiwara H', 'Yasukawa M']","['Ehime University Graduate School of Medicine, Department of Bioregulatory Medicine, Shitsukawa, Toon, Ehime 791-0295, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,England,Expert Opin Ther Targets,Expert opinion on therapeutic targets,101127833,,2009/10/14 06:00,2010/01/27 06:00,['2009/10/14 06:00'],"['2009/10/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1517/14728220903307483 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Ther Targets. 2009 Dec;13(12):1399-410. doi: 10.1517/14728220903307483.,12,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Aurora Kinases', 'Cancer Vaccines/therapeutic use', 'Humans', '*Immunotherapy', 'Leukemia/*enzymology/immunology/*therapy', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/*immunology/*physiology', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccines, Subunit/therapeutic use']",95,"['0 (Cancer Vaccines)', '0 (Vaccines, Subunit)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Aurora Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The apoptosis rate was determined by morphological analysis and flow cytomytry. The expression of Daxx, Bcl-2, and Bcl-xl proteins was detected by Western blot. NaB and TSA could induce the apoptosis of HL-60 and K562 cells, and Z-VAD-FMK caused a marked decrease in apoptosis induced by HDAC inhibitors. HDAC inhibitors could down-regulate the expression of Daxx protein, but had no significant influence on the expression of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl proteins.

The block of hERG protein might be a potential therapeutic strategy for leukemia. Gambogic acid (GA) has recently exhibited marked anti-tumor potency on solid tumors of various derivations. Here, we investigated the anti-leukemia effects of GA and its relation to the regulation of hERG in K562 leukemia cells in vitro. K562 cells were treated with various concentrations of GA (0.125-8.0 micromol/L) for 0-72 h. MTT assay was used to evaluate the inhibition effect of GA on the growth of K562 cells. Cell apoptosis was measured through both Annexin-V FITC/PI double-labeled cytometry and transmission electron microscopy. Cell cycle regulation was studied by a propidium iodide method. RT-PCR and Western blot were applied to detect the expression level of hERG in K562 cells. GA presented striking growth inhibition and apoptosis induction potency on K562 cells in vitro in a time- and dose-dependent manner. The IC(50) value of GA for 24 h was 2.637+/-0.208 micromol/L. Moreover, GA induced K562 cells arrested in G(0)/G(1) phase, accordingly, cells in S phase decreased gradually, and no obvious changes were found in G(2)/M phase cells. Under the transmission electron microscopy, apoptotic bodies containing nuclear fragments were found in GA-treated K562 cells. After treatment with GA of 2.0 micromol/L for 24 h, the percentage of apoptotic cells was increased from 4.09% to 18.47% (P<0.01). Overexpression of hERG channel was found in K562 cells, while GA could down-regulate it at both protein and mRNA levels (P<0.01). It was concluded that GA exhibited its anti-leukemia effects partially through down-regulating the expression level of hERG channel in K562 cells, suggesting that GA may be a potential agent against leukemia with a mechanism of blocking hERG channel.","['Cui, Guohui', 'Shu, Wenxiu', 'Wu, Qing', 'Chen, Yan']","['Cui G', 'Shu W', 'Wu Q', 'Chen Y']","['Department of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430022, China. ghcui@medmail.com.cn']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091011,China,J Huazhong Univ Sci Technolog Med Sci,Journal of Huazhong University of Science and Technology.

METHODS: Mononuclear blood cells from AML patients were isolated before (n = 20) and after anthracycline infusion (n = 24). The pre-treated cells were incubated in vitro with daunorubicin (DNR) and/or idarubicin (IDA). Anthracycline concentrations were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography, and apoptosis was detected by propidium iodine staining using a flow cytometer. RESULTS: There was a clear concentration-response relationship between intracellular anthracycline levels and apoptosis albeit with a large interindividual variation. Intracellular levels >1200 muM always led to high apoptosis development (>60%) in vitro. The intracellular concentrations of DNR in vivo (n = 24) were more than tenfold lower than the concentrations needed to induce effective apoptosis in vitro, although a significant relation between in vivo concentrations and clinical remission was found.

METHODS: We reviewed 10 chest CT scans of six neutropenic or immunocompromised patients hospitalized in the hematology and bone marrow transplant ward of the Hospital Sao Paulo, in the city of Sao Paulo, Brazil, who were diagnosed with IPA between April of 2007 and October of 2007. The diagnosis of IPA was confirmed by anatomopathological findings (in 2 cases), culture (in 3 cases) or appropriate treatment response (in 1 case). RESULTS: We evaluated the CT scans of three male and three female patients, ranging from 22 to 58 years of age. The most common tomographic findings were nodules (5/6 cases) and areas of consolidation (2/6 cases). The nodules were more often multiple (3/5 cases), with irregular contours (4/5 cases) and accompanied by the halo sign (3/5 cases). One case presented multiple, centrally distributed areas of consolidation, and another presented an isolated, peripheral area of consolidation. Areas of ground-glass attenuation and septal thickening were found in three and two patients, respectively. Bilateral pleural effusion occurred in three cases. CONCLUSIONS: Consolidation, nodules, septal thickening, pleural effusion and ground-glass opacities were the principal tomographic findings in the six patients hospitalized in the above mentioned ward during the IPA outbreak. The nodules were often (in 67% of the cases) accompanied by the halo sign, a classically described finding in patients with IPA.","['Freitas, Daniela Batista de Almeida', 'Piovesan, Ana Claudia', 'Szarf, Gilberto', 'Jasinowodolinski, Dany', 'Meirelles, Gustavo de Souza Portes']","['Freitas DB', 'Piovesan AC', 'Szarf G', 'Jasinowodolinski D', 'Meirelles GS']","['Escola Paulista de Medicina, Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, SP, Brasil. daniela.ba@gmail.com']","['eng', 'por']",['Journal Article'],,Brazil,J Bras Pneumol,Jornal brasileiro de pneumologia : publicacao oficial da Sociedade Brasileira de Pneumologia e Tisilogia,101222274,,2009/10/13 06:00,2010/05/08 06:00,['2009/10/13 06:00'],"['2009/01/26 00:00 [received]', '2009/03/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/10/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/08 06:00 [medline]']","['S1806-37132009000900015 [pii]', '10.1590/s1806-37132009000900015 [doi]']",ppublish,J Bras Pneumol. 2009 Sep;35(9):931-6. doi: 10.1590/s1806-37132009000900015.,9,IM,"['Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Invasive Pulmonary Aspergillosis/*diagnostic imaging', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/classification/diagnostic imaging', 'Lung Neoplasms/diagnostic imaging', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Pulmonary Nodules/diagnostic imaging', 'Pleural Effusion, Malignant/diagnostic imaging', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnostic imaging', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed', 'Young Adult']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the search for novel treatment strategies for these patients, we conducted a multicenter retrospective analysis and identified 22 patients treated with the DNA-methylation inhibitor 5-azacytidine (5-Aza). Patients received a median number of two cycles 5-Aza (range 1-8) at a dose of 100 mg/m(2) over 5 days following relapse. Eighteen patients (82%) also received a median number of two donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI, range 1-5). Sixteen patients (72%) responded to 5-Aza treatment and five patients (23%) achieved a CR. 5-Aza-induced CR lasted for 433 days (median, range 114-769). Median survival and the estimated 2-year survival rate were 144 days and 23%, respectively. Acute GVHD after DLI was seen in six patients (33%) and four of these patients developed chronic GVHD of the skin. There were no treatment-related deaths.

METHODS: The combined effect of SG235-TRAIL and HHT was assessed using a crystal violet assay and 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, followed by combination index analysis. Cell apoptosis was measured using flow cytometry combined with fluorescein-isothiocyanate-Annexin V staining. The activation of caspase pathway and the expression of Bcl-2 family proteins, TRAIL, and E1A were examined using Western blotting. RESULTS: HHT synergized the cytotoxicity of SG235-TRAIL against leukemia cell lines Kasumi-1, KG-1, HL-60, and U937, concomitantly with increased apoptosis and enhanced activity of caspase-3 and -9. The combination therapy resulted in significantly lower levels of Bcl-2, Mcl-1, and Bid compared to treatment of cells with either HHT or SG235-TRAIL alone, suggesting that HHT sensitizes leukemia cells to SG235-TRAIL virus through alteration of anti-apoptotic signaling elements. Importantly, HHT combined with SG235-TRAIL did not show significant cytotoxicity to normal human mononuclear cells and mesenchymal stem cells. CONCLUSION: Combining oncolytic adenovirus SG235-TRAIL and HHT synergistically enhances cytotoxicity in leukemia cells in vitro, suggesting that the combination therapy could represent a rational approach for the treatment of leukemia.","['Meng, Hai-tao', 'Li, Lu', 'Liu, Hui', 'Wang, Ying', 'Li, Gong-chu', 'Qian, Wen-bin']","['Meng HT', 'Li L', 'Liu H', 'Wang Y', 'Li GC', 'Qian WB']","['Institute of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091012,United States,Acta Pharmacol Sin,Acta pharmacologica Sinica,100956087,PMC4003008,2009/10/13 06:00,2010/01/26 06:00,['2009/10/13 06:00'],"['2009/10/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/26 06:00 [medline]']","['aps2009147 [pii]', '10.1038/aps.2009.147 [doi]']",ppublish,Acta Pharmacol Sin. 2009 Nov;30(11):1529-36. doi: 10.1038/aps.2009.147.

Here we demonstrate that chromatin conformation capture on chip (4C) technology can be used to screen large genomic regions for balanced and complex inversions and translocations at high resolution. The 4C technique can be used to detect breakpoints also in repetitive DNA sequences as it uniquely relies on capturing genomic fragments across the breakpoint. Using 4C, we uncovered LMO3 as a potentially leukemogenic translocation partner of TRB@. We developed multiplex 4C to simultaneously screen for translocation partners of multiple selected loci. We identified unsuspected translocations and complex rearrangements. Furthermore, using 4C we detected translocations even in small subpopulations of cells. This strategy opens avenues for the rapid fine-mapping of cytogenetically identified translocations and inversions, and the efficient screening for balanced rearrangements near candidate loci, even when rearrangements exist only in subpopulations of cells.","['Simonis, Marieke', 'Klous, Petra', 'Homminga, Irene', 'Galjaard, Robert-Jan', 'Rijkers, Erik-Jan', 'Grosveld, Frank', 'Meijerink, Jules P P', 'de Laat, Wouter']","['Simonis M', 'Klous P', 'Homminga I', 'Galjaard RJ', 'Rijkers EJ', 'Grosveld F', 'Meijerink JP', 'de Laat W']","['Hubrecht Institute, Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences (KNAW) and University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091011,United States,Nat Methods,Nature methods,101215604,,2009/10/13 06:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/10/13 06:00'],"['2009/07/21 00:00 [received]', '2009/09/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/10/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['nmeth.1391 [pii]', '10.1038/nmeth.1391 [doi]']",ppublish,Nat Methods. 2009 Nov;6(11):837-42. doi: 10.1038/nmeth.1391.

Here, this straightforward approach is applied for comparing curves using the example of (111)In- and (90)Y-labelled anti-CD66 antibody serum time activity data. As a result it is shown that for the investigated (111)In- and (90)Y-labelled anti-CD66 antibodies, the biokinetics between dosimetry and therapy are different with respect to the contribution of the second, longer half-life component.

Cardiac dysfunction during AML treatment of these patients previously treated with anthracyclines for breast cancer has not been reported to date. We evaluated the evolution of cardiac function in seven patients treated with anthracyclines and/or autologous or allogeneic bone marrow transplantation for secondary AML occurring after breast cancer. All of the patients who received a cumulative anthracycline dose above the cardiac toxicity threshold developed cardiac symptoms during AML chemotherapy courses. Moreover, four of the five transplanted patients developed severe heart failure among which two were fatal. Thus, the risk of severe cardiac dysfunction after treatment of secondary AML following breast cancer must be taken in account as part of the therapeutic strategy of those patients. As discussed here, an accurate evaluation of risk factors, the use of sensitive detection tests and of cardioprotective drugs as well as that of non-cardiotoxic chemotherapy might decrease the occurrence and severity of this life-threatening complication.","['Willems, L', 'Suarez, F', 'Messas, E', 'Baubion, N', 'Decaudin, D', 'Fourquet, A', 'Ghez, D', 'Delarue, R', 'Hermine, O', 'Buzyn, A', 'Varet, B', 'Rubio, M-T']","['Willems L', 'Suarez F', 'Messas E', 'Baubion N', 'Decaudin D', 'Fourquet A', 'Ghez D', 'Delarue R', 'Hermine O', 'Buzyn A', 'Varet B', 'Rubio MT']","[""Service d'hematologie, hopital Necker, 149, rue de Sevres, 75015 Paris, France. lisewillems2@gmail.com""]",['fre'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,France,Bull Cancer,Bulletin du cancer,0072416,,2009/10/13 06:00,2010/03/02 06:00,['2009/10/13 06:00'],"['2009/10/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/02 06:00 [medline]']","['S0007-4551(15)30887-0 [pii]', '10.1684/bdc.2009.0958 [doi]']",ppublish,Bull Cancer. 2010 Feb;97(2):245-54. doi: 10.1684/bdc.2009.0958.,2,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', '*Breast Neoplasms/drug therapy/radiotherapy', 'Chemotherapy, Adjuvant/adverse effects', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Epirubicin/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Fluorouracil/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Heart Diseases/chemically induced/drug therapy/physiopathology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects/methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*therapy', 'Remission Induction', 'Stroke Volume/drug effects/physiology']",,"['3Z8479ZZ5X (Epirubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)', 'FEC protocol']",,Risque eleve de dysfonction cardiaque des leucemies aigues myeloides secondaires a un cancer du sein.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, prospective isolation of human LSC from patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), as well as the assessment of their clinical significance, has remained a major challenge. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We have studied the functional characteristics of a subset of leukemia cells that expressed CD34 and high aldehyde dehydrogenase activity (ALDH(br)), which was freshly isolated from the mononuclear cells at the time of diagnosis from the marrow of 68 consecutive patients suffering from AML. RESULTS: The percentage of ALDH(br) cells ranged from 0.01% to 16.0% with a median of 0.5%. Compared to their counterparts with low aldehyde dehydrogenase activity from the same individual patients, the ALDH(br) population showed a significantly higher affinity to human mesenchymal stromal cells (n=12; p<0.01), a more than twofold higher proportion of slow-dividing and quiescent cells (n=4; p<0.05), higher numbers of long-term culture-initiating cell colonies in vitro (n=25; p<0.01), and an enhanced engraftment in the nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient mouse model (n=3; p<0.05). Above all, we found that the frequency of ALDH(br) cells correlated significantly with diminished survival probability (p=0.025) and with adverse cytogenetic factors (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: A small proportion of leukemia cells derived from the marrow of patients with AML were ALDH(br) and CD34(+). They demonstrated functional characteristics of LSC and high percentages of these cells among the leukemia cells correlated significantly with poor clinical outcome.","['Ran, Dan', 'Schubert, Mario', 'Pietsch, Larissa', 'Taubert, Isabel', 'Wuchter, Patrick', 'Eckstein, Volker', 'Bruckner, Thomas', 'Zoeller, Margot', 'Ho, Anthony D']","['Ran D', 'Schubert M', 'Pietsch L', 'Taubert I', 'Wuchter P', 'Eckstein V', 'Bruckner T', 'Zoeller M', 'Ho AD']","['Department of Internal Medicine V, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg 69120, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091009,Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,,2009/10/13 06:00,2010/01/07 06:00,['2009/10/13 06:00'],"['2009/08/10 00:00 [received]', '2009/10/05 00:00 [revised]', '2009/10/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/10/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/07 06:00 [medline]']","['S0301-472X(09)00390-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2009.10.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2009 Dec;37(12):1423-34. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2009.10.001.

To elucidate the instructive mechanisms involved in the differentiation steps we investigated the effects of Wnt-signaling members, Wnt3a and beta-catenin, on the differentiation of F9 cells and beta-catenin-deficient F9 cells (betaT cells). RA up-regulated the expression of differentiation markers for primitive, visceral and parietal endoderm in F9 cells but not for visceral endoderm in betaT cells. Wnt3a or leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) inhibited the RA-induced differentiation in F9 cells. LIF but not Wnt3a could inhibit differentiation in betaT cells. RA evoked ZO-1alpha+ signals at cell-to-cell contacts in F9 cells in a Wnt3a sensitive manner.

We show here that SKIP also associates with c-Myc and Menin, a subunit of the MLL1 histone methyltransferase (H3K4me3) complex and that HIV-1 Tat transactivation requires c-Myc and Menin, but not MLL1 or H3K4me3. RNAi-ChIP experiments reveal that SKIP acts downstream of Tat:P-TEFb to recruit c-Myc and its partner TRRAP, a scaffold for histone acetyltransferases, to the HIV-1 promoter. By contrast, SKIP is recruited by the RNF20 H2B ubiquitin ligase to the basal HIV-1 promoter in a step that is bypassed by Tat and downregulated by c-Myc. Of interest, we find that SKIP and P-TEFb are dispensable for UV stress-induced HIV-1 transcription, which is strongly upregulated by treating cells with the CDK9 inhibitor flavopiridol. Thus, SKIP acts with c-Myc and Menin to promote HIV-1 Tat:P-TEFb transcription at an elongation step that is bypassed under stress.","['Bres, Vanessa', 'Yoshida, Tomonori', 'Pickle, Loni', 'Jones, Katherine A']","['Bres V', 'Yoshida T', 'Pickle L', 'Jones KA']","['Regulatory Biology Laboratory, The Salk Institute for Biological Studies, La Jolla, CA 92037-1099, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Mol Cell,Molecular cell,9802571,PMC2766281,2009/10/13 06:00,2009/12/22 06:00,['2009/10/13 06:00'],"['2009/01/05 00:00 [received]', '2009/05/11 00:00 [revised]', '2009/08/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/10/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/22 06:00 [medline]']","['S1097-2765(09)00595-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.molcel.2009.08.015 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell. 2009 Oct 9;36(1):75-87. doi: 10.1016/j.molcel.2009.08.015.,1,IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/genetics/metabolism', 'Cyclin T/genetics/metabolism', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 9/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'DNA Damage/physiology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Flavonoids/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral/drug effects/*physiology/radiation effects', 'HIV Long Terminal Repeat/physiology', 'HeLa Cells', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Methylation', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Nuclear Receptor Coactivators/genetics/*metabolism', 'Piperidines/pharmacology', 'Positive Transcriptional Elongation Factor B/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/physiology', 'Protein Binding/physiology', 'Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs/physiology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation/drug effects/*physiology/radiation effects', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/genetics', 'Ultraviolet Rays', 'tat Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus/*metabolism']",,"['0 (ASH2L protein, human)', '0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (CCNT1 protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin T)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (MEN1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Receptor Coactivators)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (SNW1 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (tat Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus)', '0 (transformation-transcription domain-associated protein)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', '45AD6X575G (alvocidib)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (RNF20 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 2.7.11.- (Positive Transcriptional Elongation Factor B)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDK9 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 9)']",,,"['R01 AI044615/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI044615-10/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R56 AI044615/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI044615/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,['NIHMS142780'],,,,,,,,,,

We aimed to assess the role of a primary chemotherapy strategy in avoiding or delaying radiotherapy in children younger than 3 years with malignant brain tumours other than ependymoma, the results of which have already been published. METHODS: Ninety-seven children were enrolled between March 1993 and July 2003 and, following diagnostic review, comprised: medulloblastoma (n=31), astrocytoma (26), choroid plexus carcinoma [CPC] (15), CNS PNET (11), atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumours [AT/RT] (6) and ineligible (6). Following maximal surgical resection, chemotherapy was delivered every 14 d for 1 year or until disease progression. Radiotherapy was withheld in the absence of progression. FINDINGS: Over all diagnostic groups the cumulative progression rate was 80.9% at 5 years while the corresponding need-for-radiotherapy rate for progression was 54.6%, but both rates varied by tumour type. There was no clear relationship between chemotherapy dose intensity and outcome. Patients with medulloblastoma presented as a high-risk group, 83.9% having residual disease and/or metastases at diagnosis. For these patients, outcome was related to histology. The 5-year OS for desmoplastic/nodular medulloblastoma was 52.9% (95% confidence interval (CI): 27.6-73.0) and for classic medulloblastoma 33.3% (CI: 4.6-67.6); the 5-year EFS were 35.3% (CI: 14.5-57.0) and 33.3% (CI: 4.6-67.6), respectively. All children with large cell or anaplastic variants of medulloblastoma died within 2 years of diagnosis. The 5-year EFS for non-brainstem high-grade gliomas [HGGs] was 13.0% (CI: 2.2-33.4) and the OS was 30.9% (CI: 11.5-52.8). For CPC the 5-year OS was 26.67% (CI: 8.3-49.6) without RT. This treatment strategy was less effective for AT/RT with 3-year OS of 16.7% (CI: 0.8-51.7) and CNS PNET with 1-year OS of 9.1% (CI: 0.5-33.3). INTERPRETATION: The outcome for very young children with brain tumours is dictated by degree of surgical resection and histological tumour type and underlying biology as an indicator of treatment sensitivity. Overall, the median age at radiotherapy was 3 years and radiotherapy was avoided in 45% of patients. Desmoplastic/nodular sub-type of medulloblastoma has a better prognosis than classic histology, despite traditional adverse clinical features of metastatic disease and incomplete surgical resection. A subgroup with HGG and CPC are long-term survivors without RT. This study highlights the differing therapeutic challenges presented by the malignant brain tumours of early childhood, the importance of surgical approaches and the need to explore individualised brain sparing approaches to the range of malignant brain tumours that present in early childhood.","['Grundy, R G', 'Wilne, S H', 'Robinson, K J', 'Ironside, J W', 'Cox, T', 'Chong, W K', 'Michalski, A', 'Campbell, R H A', 'Bailey, C C', 'Thorp, N', 'Pizer, B', 'Punt, J', 'Walker, D A', 'Ellison, D W', 'Machin, D']","['Grundy RG', 'Wilne SH', 'Robinson KJ', 'Ironside JW', 'Cox T', 'Chong WK', 'Michalski A', 'Campbell RH', 'Bailey CC', 'Thorp N', 'Pizer B', 'Punt J', 'Walker DA', 'Ellison DW', 'Machin D']","[""Children's Brain Tumour Research Centre, University of Nottingham, Queen's Medical Centre, Nottingham, UK. richard.grundy@nottingham.ac.uk""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Eur J Cancer,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",9005373,,2009/10/13 06:00,2010/03/26 06:00,['2009/10/13 06:00'],"['2009/06/12 00:00 [received]', '2009/09/07 00:00 [revised]', '2009/09/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/10/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/26 06:00 [medline]']","['S0959-8049(09)00699-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ejca.2009.09.013 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Cancer. 2010 Jan;46(1):120-33. doi: 10.1016/j.ejca.2009.09.013.,1,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Astrocytoma/drug therapy/radiotherapy/surgery', 'Brain Neoplasms/*drug therapy/radiotherapy/surgery', 'Child, Preschool', 'Choroid Plexus Neoplasms/drug therapy/radiotherapy/surgery', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Medulloblastoma/drug therapy/radiotherapy/surgery', 'Neuroectodermal Tumors, Primitive/drug therapy/radiotherapy/surgery', 'Radiotherapy, Adjuvant/methods', 'Survival Analysis', 'Teratoma/drug therapy/radiotherapy/surgery', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,,,['Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,,,"[""Children's Cancer and Leukaemia Group (formerly UKCCSG) Brain Tumour Committee""]",,,,

Previous studies have shown that DC-based tumor vaccines in animal tumor models can inhibit tumor growth and induce autoantibodies transiently without clinical or histological features of autoimmunity. The present study aimed to investigate the role of immune response induced by dendritic cells-based therapy, especially anti-ds DNA antibodies in tumor inhibition. In this study, high titers of anti-ds DNA antibodies were induced after injecting syngeneic dendritic cells into BALB/c mice. In addition, mice immunized with DCs showed the inhibition of RL male symbol 1, BALB/c leukemia cell line, tumor growth, and prolonged survival times of tumor mice but no significant difference was found in specific CTL response and NK cell activity when compared to those of the control group. Anti-ds DNA monoclonal antibodies can recognize RL male symbol 1 cells but not normal cells by FACS analysis. Monoclonal anti-ds DNA antibody was demonstrated to be able to lyse tumor cells via complement mediated reaction in vitro and also exhibits the anti-tumor effects when the antibody was injected into tumor-implanted mice. The data suggested that immunization with dendritic cells can induce autoimmune response, which might exert anti-tumor activity in vivo.","['Tsai, Bor-Yu', 'Lin, Yu-Li', 'Chiang, Bor-Luen']","['Tsai BY', 'Lin YL', 'Chiang BL']","['Graduate Institute of Immunology, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091008,England,J Autoimmun,Journal of autoimmunity,8812164,,2009/10/13 06:00,2010/08/14 06:00,['2009/10/13 06:00'],"['2009/04/16 00:00 [received]', '2009/08/29 00:00 [revised]', '2009/08/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/10/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/14 06:00 [medline]']","['S0896-8411(09)00112-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jaut.2009.08.013 [doi]']",ppublish,J Autoimmun. 2010 Jun;34(4):364-70. doi: 10.1016/j.jaut.2009.08.013.

Disruption of Abl kinase signaling through the Philadelphia chromosome (causing the Bcr-Abl mutation) in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) has provided a paradigm for development of kinase inhibitor drugs such as the specific inhibitor imatinib (also known as STI571 or Gleevec). However, because patients are treated indefinitely with this drug to maintain remission, resistance is increasingly becoming an issue. Although there are many ways to detect kinase activity, most lack the ability to ""multiplex"" the analysis (i.e., to detect more than one substrate simultaneously). Here we report a novel biosensor for detecting Abl kinase activity and sensitivity to inhibitor in live intact cells overexpressing a CML model Abl kinase construct. This straightforward methodology could eventually provide a new tool for detecting kinase activity and inhibitor drug response in cancer cells that overexpress oncogenic kinases.","['Placzek, Ekaterina A', 'Plebanek, Michael P', 'Lipchik, Andrew M', 'Kidd, Stephanie R', 'Parker, Laurie L']","['Placzek EA', 'Plebanek MP', 'Lipchik AM', 'Kidd SR', 'Parker LL']","['Department of Medicinal Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Center for Cancer Research, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN 47904, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20091007,United States,Anal Biochem,Analytical biochemistry,0370535,PMC2808441,2009/10/13 06:00,2010/03/31 06:00,['2009/10/13 06:00'],"['2009/09/16 00:00 [received]', '2009/09/26 00:00 [revised]', '2009/09/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/10/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/31 06:00 [medline]']","['S0003-2697(09)00698-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ab.2009.09.048 [doi]']",ppublish,Anal Biochem. 2010 Feb 1;397(1):73-8. doi: 10.1016/j.ab.2009.09.048.

When exposed to CdCl(2), L24 cells showed lower viability than the control S13 cells and caspase-dependent apoptosis was enhanced more in L24 cells. Localization of EGFP-Ca(v)2.1CT was almost confined to the nucleus, where it existed as speckle-like structures. Interestingly, CdCl(2) treatment resulted in disruption of more promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies (PML-NBs) in L24 cells than in S13 cells and in cells where PML-NBs were disrupted, aggregates of EGFP-Ca(v)2.1CT became larger. Furthermore, a large number of aggregates were formed in L24 cells than in S13 cells. Results of RNAi experiments indicated that HSPA1A determined the difference against CdCl(2) toxicity. Furthermore, protein expression of heat shock transcription factor 1 (HSF1), which activates HSPA1A expression, was down-regulated in L24 cells.

METHODS: Information was obtained via the internet and a journal literature review. RESULTS: In 1999, the FDA approved the use of denileukin diftitox for patients with persistent or relapsed CD25-positive cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL), but Ontak has been reported to be an effective therapy for other neoplastic and non-neoplastic conditions. Oncological uses include therapy for CD25-negative T-cell lymphoma, recurrent and refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), non-Hodgkin's B-cell lymphoma (NHL), and human T-cell lymphotropic virus- 1 (HTLV-1)-associated adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL). Potential additional uses of Ontak include: therapy of graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) and autoimmune conditions, including psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic lupus, scleroderma and vasculitis. Denileukin diftitox's effect has also been studied for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and HIV, but conclusive data are still pending.

Also, targeted therapeutic strategies are continuously expanding as illustrated by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) imatinib for BCR-ABL positive ALL. Thus, molecular analysis based on various techniques, such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has become an essential part of the diagnostic panel for acute leukemia. In addition, cytomorphology, cytogenetics, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and immunophenotyping with multiparameter flow cytometry (MFC) need to be applied for diagnosis. During the course of disease, the residual leukemic cell load can be monitored by highly sensitive quantitative PCR techniques (""real-time PCR""). At present, new techniques, such as high throughput sequencing (next generation sequencing, NGS) or gene expression profiling with microarrays are being explored for use in hematological malignancies, and are being evaluated in preclinical studies. This demonstrates that molecular diagnostics for acute leukemias are in continuous development. This review summarizes the most important recurrent molecular markers seen in acute leukemias, their role in prognosis and therapy and provides an overview on the relevant PCR techniques.","['Bacher, Ulrike', 'Schnittger, Susanne', 'Haferlach, Claudia', 'Haferlach, Torsten']","['Bacher U', 'Schnittger S', 'Haferlach C', 'Haferlach T']","['Interdisciplinary Clinic for Stem Cell Transplantation, University Cancer Center Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Germany,Clin Chem Lab Med,Clinical chemistry and laboratory medicine,9806306,,2009/10/13 06:00,2010/02/05 06:00,['2009/10/13 06:00'],"['2009/10/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1515/CCLM.2009.324 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Chem Lab Med. 2009;47(11):1333-41. doi: 10.1515/CCLM.2009.324.,11,IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis', '*Molecular Diagnostic Techniques', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis']",78,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Four different bone marrow cell cultures from each of four leukemia cases were prepared. The 60 ng/ml, 30 ng/ml and 15 ng/ml working concentrations of propolis were administered to three cultures of each patient, while one culture contained only culture medium. hTERT mRNA expression levels of cells were detected at 24 h, 48 h and 72 h using the LightCycler 2.0 instrument. A significant decrease in hTERT expression levels was observed in the 60 ng/ml concentration of propolis.

Charts of patients who met the diagnostic criteria for sHLH associated with malignancy between January 2000-2006 at six different hospitals in Turkey were reviewed retrospectively. The diagnosis of HLH had been established by bone marrow aspiration in 27 patients, cerebrospinal fluid and bone marrow aspiration in one patient and lung-liver biopsy in another. Twenty-nine children were diagnosed as having sHLH related to malignancy. Twenty cases (18 ALL and 2 AML) with acute leukemia (10 girls/10 boys, median age: 8 years [3-14 years]) were found to have sHLH. Five patients with acute leukemia had HLH at the time of diagnosis (Group 1a), and 15 patients with acute leukemia were diagnosed as having sHLH during therapy (Group 1b), namely reactive sHLH associated with the chemotherapy. Nine patients, including two cases each of rhabdomyosarcoma, neuroblastoma, Hodgkin disease, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and one case with Langerhans cell histiocytosis, were diagnosed as having concomitant hemophagocytosis at the initial evaluation of the tumor (Group 2). Fever, anemia, and hypertriglyceridemia were present in all sHLH cases of all three groups. Hepatomegaly was detected in 60.0%, 73.3%, and 88.8% of the three groups, respectively. Splenomegaly was more frequent in patients of Groups 1a (60.0%) and 2 (88.8%) than in those of Group 1b, the reactive ones (13.3%). Hypofibrinogenemia was detected in all patients of Group 1a and Group 2. Low level of fibrinogen was present in 91.6% of patients in Group 1b. All patients in Group 1b (100%) had neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. Neutropenia was found at rates of 60.0% and 55.5% in Group 1a and Group 2, respectively. Thrombocytopenia was detected in 80.0% of patients in Group 1a and 77.7% in Group 2. The overall mortality rate was 34.4% (10 cases) in our series of 29 children with sHLH; 50% of deaths were directly attributable to HLH. Pediatric malignancy-associated HLH patients have been commonly described as case presentations or in a review of the literature. We believe that our cohort, compiling 29 children regarding the association between malignancy and HLH, will be useful for pediatricians who are interested in this still mysterious topic.","['Celkan, Tiraje', 'Berrak, Su', 'Kazanci, Elif', 'Ozyurek, Emel', 'Unal, Sule', 'Ucar, Canan', 'Yilmaz, Sebnem', 'Gurgey, Aytemiz']","['Celkan T', 'Berrak S', 'Kazanci E', 'Ozyurek E', 'Unal S', 'Ucar C', 'Yilmaz S', 'Gurgey A']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Istanbul University Cerrahpasa Faculty of Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",,Turkey,Turk J Pediatr,The Turkish journal of pediatrics,0417505,,2009/10/13 06:00,2009/10/30 06:00,['2009/10/13 06:00'],"['2009/10/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/30 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Turk J Pediatr. 2009 May-Jun;51(3):207-13.,3,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*complications/drug therapy', 'Lymphohistiocytosis, Hemophagocytic/*diagnosis/*etiology/mortality', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications/drug therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Turkey']",,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Induction of EBV lytic cycle leads to expression of a much larger number of viral proteins, which may serve as potential therapeutic targets. We found that 4 histone deacetylase inhibitors, trichostatin A (TSA), sodium butyrate (SB), valproic acid (VPA) and suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA), all significantly induced EBV lytic cycle in EBV-positive gastric carcinoma cells (AGS/BX1, latency II) but only weakly induced in Burkitt lymphoma cells (AK2003, latency I) and did not induce in lymphoblastoid cells (LCLs, latency III). Interestingly, SAHA potently induced viral lytic cycle in AGS/BX1 cells at micromolar concentrations (evidenced by 8-fold increase in viral DNA replication, strong expression of viral lytic proteins and production of infectious virus particles) and mediated enhanced cell death of EBV-positive AGS/BX1 cells when compared with that of EBV-negative AGS cells, possibly related to cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase. Furthermore, SAHA effected strong induction of EBV lytic cycle in nasopharyngeal carcinoma but not in NK lymphoma cells (both expressing EBV latency II pattern), indicating preferential viral lytic induction in epithelial rather than lymphoid malignancies. In conclusion, SAHA is found to be a potent EBV lytic cycle inducing agent, which warrants further investigation into its potential application as a novel virus-targeted drug for treatment of EBV-associated epithelial malignancies.","['Hui, K F', 'Chiang, Alan K S']","['Hui KF', 'Chiang AK']","['Department of Paediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Queen Mary Hospital, Pokfulam, Hong Kong SAR, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,,2009/10/10 06:00,2010/04/23 06:00,['2009/10/10 06:00'],"['2009/10/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ijc.24945 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2010 May 15;126(10):2479-89. doi: 10.1002/ijc.24945.,10,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/drug therapy/virology', 'Butyrates/pharmacology', 'Carcinoma/*drug therapy/*virology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/*drug effects', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/virology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Stomach Neoplasms/drug therapy/virology', 'Valproic Acid/pharmacology', 'Vorinostat']",,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Butyrates)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '3X2S926L3Z (trichostatin A)', '58IFB293JI (Vorinostat)', '614OI1Z5WI (Valproic Acid)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For example, development of post-implantation epiblast cells from primitive ectoderm involves significant transcriptional and epigenetic changes, including DNA methylation and X chromosome inactivation, which create a robust epigenetic barrier and prevent their reversion to a primitive-ectoderm-like state. Epiblast cells are refractory to leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF)-STAT3 signalling, but they respond to activin/basic fibroblast growth factor to form self-renewing epiblast stem cells (EpiSCs), which exhibit essential properties of epiblast cells and that differ from embryonic stem (ES) cells derived from primitive ectoderm. Here we show reprogramming of advanced epiblast cells from embryonic day 5.5-7.5 mouse embryos with uniform expression of N-cadherin and inactive X chromosome to ES-cell-like cells (rESCs) in response to LIF-STAT3 signalling. Cultured epiblast cells overcome the epigenetic barrier progressively as they proceed with the erasure of key properties of epiblast cells, resulting in DNA demethylation, X reactivation and expression of E-cadherin. The accompanying changes in the transcriptome result in a loss of phenotypic and epigenetic memory of epiblast cells. Using this approach, we report reversion of established EpiSCs to rESCs.

To investigate the pathologic characteristics of a near-tetraploidy in a child with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML-M4), bone marrow smears were prepared for morphologic analysis. Bone marrow samples were collected at presentation for flow cytometry, prepared by short-term (24 h) unstimulated culture and R-banding for conventional cytogenetic assay. We have performed a multifactorial analysis of the laboratory test results. In this case, the chromosomal analysis (R-banding) demonstrated a near-tetraploidy. Combined with morphologic and immunophenotypic results, the diagnosis was established as acute myelogenous leukemia (AML-M4). Near-tetraploidy is an uncommon cytogenetic finding, and the experience of this case further emphasizes the importance of the laboratory diagnostic methods.","['Zhang, Ji-Hong', 'Zheng, Ying-Chun', 'Wang, Yun-Xiu', 'Zhang, Jun-Yan', 'Liu, Zhuo-Gang']","['Zhang JH', 'Zheng YC', 'Wang YX', 'Zhang JY', 'Liu ZG']","['Department of Hematology/ Oncology Laboratory, Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, China. zhangjihong_cmu@sina.com']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,,2009/10/10 06:00,2010/01/26 06:00,['2009/10/10 06:00'],"['2009/10/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/MPH.0b013e3181b794b2 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2010 Jan;32(1):19-21. doi: 10.1097/MPH.0b013e3181b794b2.,1,IM,"['Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cell Nucleus/*pathology', 'Child', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/*diagnosis/*genetics/pathology', '*Polyploidy']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, primary manifestation of SLL/CLL in the prostate is rarely diagnosed. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We report two cases of primary prostatic SLL/CLL, in one case in combination with prostate carcinoma, and discuss diagnostic pitfalls, pathophysiological mechanisms and therapeutic management, together with an overview of the literature. CONCLUSIONS: Lymphocytic infiltration of the prostate associated with obstructive symptoms is rare but can already occur in very early disease. Microscopically, SLL/CLL infiltration can be distinguished from chronic prostatitis by its pattern of infiltration and by immunohistochemistry. As the incidence of both SLL/CLL and prostatic carcinoma increases with age, composite tumours might occur more often in the future.","['Fehr, Martin', 'Templeton, Arnoud', 'Cogliatti, Sergio', 'Aebersold, Franziska', 'Egli, Fritz', 'Gillessen, Silke', 'Cathomas, Richard']","['Fehr M', 'Templeton A', 'Cogliatti S', 'Aebersold F', 'Egli F', 'Gillessen S', 'Cathomas R']","['Departement Innere Medizin, Medizinische Onkologie und Hamatologie, Kantonsspital Graubunden, Chur,Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",20090911,Switzerland,Onkologie,Onkologie,7808556,,2009/10/10 06:00,2010/01/05 06:00,['2009/10/10 06:00'],"['2009/10/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/05 06:00 [medline]']","['000232584 [pii]', '10.1159/000232584 [doi]']",ppublish,Onkologie. 2009 Oct;32(10):586-8. doi: 10.1159/000232584.

Nevertheless, the coincidence of chronic myeloproliferative and lymphoproliferative diseases in the same patient is a rare phenomenon. METHODS: We report a case of a patient having essential thrombocythemia (ET) and B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL). In this patient and in 2 relatives with lymphoproliferative disorders, we searched for JAK2(V617F) mutation in lymphocytes. RESULTS: In the patient with ET and B-CLL, we identified homozygous JAK2(V617F) mutation in the granulocytic compartment. Both relatives were heterozygous for JAK2(V617F) mutation, whereas no mutation signal could be detected in the lymphoid compartment of all 3 patients. CONCLUSION: Our results seem to confirm that CLL cases are negative for JAK2(V617F) mutation in B- and T-lymphocyte populations.Presence of JAK2(V617F) mutation in subjects without myeloproliferative diseases could indicate an increased risk of a future myeloproliferative neoplasm development.","['Musolino, Caterina', 'Allegra, Alessandro', 'Penna, Giuseppa', 'Centorrino, Raffaella', 'Cuzzola, Maria', ""D'Angelo, Arianna"", 'Iacopino, Pasquale', 'Alonci, Andrea']","['Musolino C', 'Allegra A', 'Penna G', 'Centorrino R', 'Cuzzola M', ""D'Angelo A"", 'Iacopino P', 'Alonci A']","['Division of Hematology, University of Messina, Policlinico G.

In this study we analyzed the effect of two selective chemical inhibitors of Akt (Akti-1/2 and A-443654) on the survival of chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells. DESIGN AND METHODS: Using cytometry we studied the cytotoxic effects of Akt inhibitors on peripheral B and T lymphocytes from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and from healthy donors. We studied the changes induced by Akti-1/2 and A-443654 at the mRNA level by performing reverse transcriptase multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification. We also studied the changes induced by both Akt inhibitors in some BCL-2 protein family members on chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells by western blotting. Moreover, we analyzed the cytotoxic effect of Akt inhibitors in patients' cells with deleted/mutated TP53. RESULTS: Both inhibitors induced apoptosis in chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, B cells from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia were more sensitive to Akt inhibitors than T cells from leukemic patients, and B or T cells from healthy donors. Survival factors for chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells, such as interleukin-4 and stromal cell-derived factor-1alpha, were not able to block the apoptosis induced by either Akt inhibitor. Akti-1/2 did not induce any change in the mRNA expression profile of genes involved in apoptosis, while A-443654 induced some changes, including an increase in NOXA and PUMA mRNA levels, suggesting the existence of additional targets for A-443654. Both inhibitors induced an increase in PUMA and NOXA protein levels, and a decrease in MCL-1 protein level. Moreover, Akti-1/2 and A-443654 induced apoptosis irrespective of TP53 status. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that Akt inhibitors induce apoptosis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells and might be a new therapeutic option for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia.","['de Frias, Merce', 'Iglesias-Serret, Daniel', 'Cosialls, Ana M', 'Coll-Mulet, Llorenc', 'Santidrian, Antonio F', 'Gonzalez-Girones, Diana M', 'de la Banda, Esmeralda', 'Pons, Gabriel', 'Gil, Joan']","['de Frias M', 'Iglesias-Serret D', 'Cosialls AM', 'Coll-Mulet L', 'Santidrian AF', 'Gonzalez-Girones DM', 'de la Banda E', 'Pons G', 'Gil J']","[""Departament de Ciencies Fisiologiques II, Institut d'Investigacio Biomedica de Bellvitge (IDIBELL), Universitat de Barcelona, L'Hospitalet de Llobregat, Barcelona, Spain.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091008,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,PMC2791940,2009/10/10 06:00,2010/02/19 06:00,['2009/10/10 06:00'],"['2009/10/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/19 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2008.004028 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2008.004028 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2009 Dec;94(12):1698-707. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2008.004028.

Since gelatinases (matrix metalloproteinases-2 and -9) play a crucial role in tumor progression, we explored the effect of thalidomide on gelatinase production by malignant B lymphoid cell lines. DESIGN AND METHODS: We investigated the effect of therapeutic doses of thalidomide on integrin-mediated production of gelatinases by malignant B lymphoid cell lines by gelatin zymography, western-blot, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and invasive capacity through Matrigel-coated Boyden chambers. We also explored the effect of thalidomide on the activation status of the main signaling pathways involved in this process. RESULTS: Thalidomide strongly inhibited gelatinase production by B-cell lines and primary myeloma cells in response to fibronectin, the most efficient gelatinase inducer identified in lymphoid cells. Thalidomide disrupted integrin-mediated signaling pathways involved in gelatinase induction and release, such as Src and MAP-kinase ERK activation, resulting in decreased cell motility and invasiveness. Unexpectedly, treatment with thalidomide elicited an increase in fibronectin-induced Akt phosphorylation through phosphoinositide 3-kinase-independent pathways since thalidomide decreased fibronectin-induced phosphoinositide 3-kinase phosphorylation and reversed the inhibition of Akt phosphorylation achieved by the phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitors wortmannin and LY294002. CONCLUSIONS: Disruption of integrin-mediated signaling may be an important mechanism through which thalidomide and its analogs impair tumor cell interactions with the microenvironment. The unexpected effects of thalidomide on Akt activation indicate the need for further studies to elucidate whether the interference with Akt downstream effects would synergize with the anti-tumor activity of thalidomide.","['Segarra, Marta', 'Lozano, Ester', 'Corbera-Bellalta, Marc', 'Vilardell, Carme', 'Cibeira, Maria-Teresa', 'Esparza, Jordi', 'Izco, Nora', 'Blade, Joan', 'Cid, Maria C']","['Segarra M', 'Lozano E', 'Corbera-Bellalta M', 'Vilardell C', 'Cibeira MT', 'Esparza J', 'Izco N', 'Blade J', 'Cid MC']","[""Department of Systemic Autoimmune Diseases, Hospital Clinic, University of Barcelona, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Barcelona, Spain.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091008,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,PMC2833076,2009/10/10 06:00,2010/07/09 06:00,['2009/10/10 06:00'],"['2009/10/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/09 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2009.006395 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2009.006395 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2010 Mar;95(3):456-63. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2009.006395.

The authors also performed a series of hematological, biochemical, histopathological, and gene expression analyses to evaluate the effect of P.amarus administration on erythroleukemia initiation and progression. The data obtained indicate that P.amarus administration could significantly decrease the progression of erythroleukemia. Treatment with P.amarus induced the expression of p53 and p45NFE2 and decreased the expression of Bcl-2 in the spleen of infected mice. Histopathological evaluations of the spleen demonstrated that administration of P.amarus decreased the infiltration of leukemic cells into the sinusoidal space when compared with the vehicle treated group.

To gain further insight into the molecular mechanisms triggered by this compound, we initially performed DNA microarray profiling and determined which genes respond to heteronemin stimulation in TNFalpha-treated cells and which genes display an interaction effect between heteronemin and TNFalpha. Within the differentially regulated genes, we found that heteronemin was affecting cellular processes including cell cycle, apoptosis, mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) pathway and the nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) signaling cascade. We confirmed in silico experiments regarding NF-kappaB inhibition by reporter gene analysis, electrophoretic mobility shift analysis and I-kappaB degradation. In order to assess the underlying molecular mechanisms, we determined that heteronemin inhibits both trypsin and chymotrypsin-like proteasome activity at an IC(50) of 0.4 microM. Concomitant to the inhibition of the NF-kappaB pathway, we also observed a reduction in cellular viability. Heteronemin induces apoptosis as shown by annexin V-FITC/propidium iodide-staining, nuclear morphology analysis, pro-caspase-3, -8 and -9 and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage as well as truncation of Bid.

METHODS: The ATRA derivatives synthesised - all-trans retinoyl glutamate (RAE) and all-trans retinoyl sodium glutamate (RAENa(2)) - were characterised in terms of melting point, optical rotation, mass spectrometry, NMR and partition coefficient. A liposomal preparation formed from RAE was characterised by particle size and zeta potential. The anti-tumour activity of RAE and RAENa(2) was compared with that of ATRA in mice bearing S(180) tumours and their effects on the cell cycle were determined in human pro-myelocytic leukaemia HL-60 cells. KEY FINDINGS: RAE and RAENa(2) were more active than ATRA against tumour growth. Flow cytometry indicated that RAE and RAENa(2) induced HL-60 cell cycle arrest, similar to ATRA. DNA fragmentation studies suggested that apoptosis may be one of the mechanisms responsible for the anti-tumour activities. CONCLUSIONS: The two derivatives of ATRA, RAE and RAENa(2), exhibited improved aqueous solubility and were more effective in mice bearing S(180) tumours.","['Cui, Chunying', 'Zhang, Yunwei', 'Wang, Lili', 'Liu, Hu', 'Cui, Guohui']","['Cui C', 'Zhang Y', 'Wang L', 'Liu H', 'Cui G']","['School of Chemical Biology and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,J Pharm Pharmacol,The Journal of pharmacy and pharmacology,0376363,,2009/10/10 06:00,2010/01/22 06:00,['2009/10/10 06:00'],"['2009/10/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1211/jpp/61.10.0012 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pharm Pharmacol. 2009 Oct;61(10):1353-8. doi: 10.1211/jpp/61.10.0012.,10,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Glutamates/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Liposomes/administration & dosage', 'Mice', 'Prodrugs/administration & dosage/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Tretinoin/*analogs & derivatives/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Burden/*drug effects']",,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Glutamates)', '0 (Liposomes)', '0 (Prodrugs)', '0 (retinoyl glutamate)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this work was to study its anti-leukaemic activity and to develop nanosuspensions of the drug, thereby limiting brain concentrations and the risk of encephalopathy. METHODS: Arsthinol nanosuspensions were produced by high-pressure homogenization. The anti-leukaemic activity was assessed on NB4 acute promyelocytic leukaemia cells (vs solutions of arsthinol, As(2)O(3) and melarsoprol). In addition, a pharmacokinetics study was performed to compare the nanosuspensions and the solution of arsthinol. KEY FINDINGS: Arsthinol induced growth inhibition of NB4 cells at lower concentration (IC50 (concentration inhibiting growth by 50%) = 0.78 +/- 0.08 micromol/l after 24 h) than As(2)O(3) (IC50 = 1.60 +/- 0.23 micromol/l after 24 h) or melarsoprol (IC50 = 1.44 +/- 0.08 micromol/l after 24 h). When formulated as nanosuspension, arsthinol remained cytotoxic (IC50 = 1.33 +/- 0.30 micromol/l after 24 h). This formulation also reduced the drug's access to the brain (C(max) = 0.03 micromol/g) whereas bone marrow concentrations remained very high (C(max) = 2 micromol/g). CONCLUSIONS: Nanosuspensions of arsthinol could be proposed for further studies in the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukaemia.","['Ajana, Imane', 'Astier, Alain', 'Gibaud, Stephane']","['Ajana I', 'Astier A', 'Gibaud S']","['EA 3452 Cibles therapeutiques formulation et expertise preclinique du medicament, Nancy Universite, Nancy, France.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",,England,J Pharm Pharmacol,The Journal of pharmacy and pharmacology,0376363,,2009/10/10 06:00,2010/01/22 06:00,['2009/10/10 06:00'],"['2009/10/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1211/jpp/61.10.0004 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pharm Pharmacol. 2009 Oct;61(10):1295-301. doi: 10.1211/jpp/61.10.0004.,10,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/chemistry/*pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism', 'Brain/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Melarsoprol/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Nanotechnology/*methods', 'Oxides/pharmacology', 'Suspensions/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology']",,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Suspensions)', 'QNT09A162Y (arsthinol)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)', 'ZF3786Q2E8 (Melarsoprol)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The function of the RNase H domain with respect to these parameters is not yet understood. To evaluate this function, two chimeric enzymes were constructed by swapping the RNase H domains between HIV-1 RT and MuLV RT. Chimeric HIV-1 RT, having the RNase H domain of MuLV RT, inherited the divalent cation preference characteristic of MuLV RT on the DNA template with no significant change on the RNA template. Chimeric MuLV RT, likewise partially inherited the metal ion preference of HIV-1 RT. Unlike the wild-type MuLV RT, chimeric MuLV RT is able to use both Mn.dNTP and Mg.dNTP on the RNA template with similar efficiency, while a 30-fold higher preference for Mn.dNTP was seen on the DNA template. The metal preferences for the RNase H activity of chimeric HIV-1 RT and chimeric MuLV RT were, respectively, Mn2+ and Mg2+, a property acquired through their swapped RNase H domains. Chimeric HIV-1 RT displayed higher fidelity and discrimination against rNTPs than against dNTPs substrates, a property inherited from MuLV RT. The overall fidelity of the chimeric MuLV RT was decreased in comparison to the parental MuLV RT, suggesting that the RNase H domain profoundly influences the function of the polymerase domain.","['Talele, Tanaji T', 'Upadhyay, Alok', 'Pandey, Virendra N']","['Talele TT', 'Upadhyay A', 'Pandey VN']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, UMDNJ-New Jersey Medical School, 185 South Orange Avenue, Newark, NJ 07103, USA. talelet@stjohns.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20091008,England,Virol J,Virology journal,101231645,PMC2765437,2009/10/10 06:00,2010/02/05 06:00,['2009/10/10 06:00'],"['2009/08/28 00:00 [received]', '2009/10/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/10/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/05 06:00 [medline]']","['1743-422X-6-159 [pii]', '10.1186/1743-422X-6-159 [doi]']",epublish,Virol J. 2009 Oct 8;6:159. doi: 10.1186/1743-422X-6-159.,,IM,"['Cations/*pharmacology', 'Coenzymes/*pharmacology', 'Genetic Engineering', 'HIV-1/*enzymology/genetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*enzymology/genetics', 'Metals/*pharmacology', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/genetics/*metabolism', 'Recombination, Genetic', 'Ribonuclease H/genetics/*metabolism', 'Substrate Specificity']",,"['0 (Cations)', '0 (Coenzymes)', '0 (Metals)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)', 'EC 3.1.26.4 (Ribonuclease H)']",,,"['R01 AI042520/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 AI042520/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI074477/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 AI074477/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI042520/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cladribine given as a single continuous intravenous seven-day infusion is the dosing schedule with the most durable complete remissions and evaluated in the greatest number of patients with HCL. Patients who relapse after purine analogue therapy, whether it be cladribine or pentostatin, can be successfully retreated with cladribine. Patients with HCL may develop complications of recurrent infection and second malignancies.

However, the tissue interactions of HCs are particularly striking and involve extensive remodelling of bone marrow, spleen and liver, with relative sparing of lymph nodes. The mechanistic basis of this remodelling is now largely understood and is described herein. Regarding HCs themselves, they are late clonal B cells which have often undergone heavy-chain-isotype class switching and whose VH genes are usually mutated. HCs are highly activated cells in which a number of signalling pathways are constitutively active. This activation determines many of the specific features of HCs, but its cause remains unknown.","['Cawley, John']",['Cawley J'],"['Division of Haematology, School of Cancer Studies, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, UK. haem@liv.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,2009/10/21 06:00,2009/12/18 06:00,['2009/10/10 06:00'],"['2009/10/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/18 06:00 [medline]']","['10.3109/10428190903142208 [pii]', '10.3109/10428190903142208 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2009 Oct;50 Suppl 1:8-11. doi: 10.3109/10428190903142208.,,IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/pathology/physiology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/pathology', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Movement/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*etiology/immunology/*pathology/physiopathology', 'Lymph Nodes/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/physiology', 'Spleen/pathology']",7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We studied the sera from 40 healthy volunteers, patients with CLL (n = 34) and MM (n = 28). In subjects with homozygote GG genotype, MPO levels were higher in the patients with both CLL and MM than in the control group. This difference was statistically significant in patients with CLL. In conclusion, homozygote GG genotype is found to be associated with an increasing amount of serum MPO. In accordance with the results of the study, we assess that the increase in the MPO enzyme level in the patient groups with CLL and MM generated bactericidal effects as well as the increased formation of ROP, thus setting off a pro-cell death pathway and playing a role on the pathogenesis of lymphoproliferative malignancies through this mechanism.","['Saygili, Eyup Ilker', 'Aksoy, Nur', 'Pehlivan, Mustafa', 'Sever, Tugce', 'Yilmaz, Mehmet', 'Cimenci, Iclal Geyikli', 'Pehlivan, Sacide']","['Saygili EI', 'Aksoy N', 'Pehlivan M', 'Sever T', 'Yilmaz M', 'Cimenci IG', 'Pehlivan S']","['Vocational School of Higher Education for Health Services, Faculty of Medicine, Gaziantep University, Gaziantep, Turkey. ilksaygili@mynet.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,2009/10/10 06:00,2010/03/24 06:00,['2009/10/10 06:00'],"['2009/10/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/24 06:00 [medline]']","['10.3109/10428190903244582 [pii]', '10.3109/10428190903244582 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2009 Dec;50(12):2030-7. doi: 10.3109/10428190903244582.,12,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Alleles', 'Female', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/enzymology/*genetics/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/enzymology/*genetics/therapy', 'Peroxidase/blood/*genetics', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide']",,['EC 1.11.1.7 (Peroxidase)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A total of 117 patients in the chronic phase of chronic myelocytic leukemia were included. The patients were treated with 400 mg/day imatinib mesylate. Bone marrow samples were obtained for the cytogenetic and molecular analyses. Patients without the Ph chromosome were defined as complete cytogenetic responders. Partial cytogenetic response was determined when the Ph chromosome was detected in 1-35% of the cells. Molecular response was determined by quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (QR-PCR) and defined as no detection of BCR-ABL mRNA. The frequencies of complete and partial cytogenetic response were 29% (n = 34) and 15% (n = 18), respectively. No cytogenetic response was achieved in 56% (n = 65) of the patients. Molecular response was achieved in 62% (n = 21) and 33% (n = 6) of the complete and partial cytogenetic responders, respectively. All of the 65 patients with no cytogenetic response were also molecular nonresponders. We conclude that there is reasonable agreement between the cytogenetic and molecular analyses.

The core binding factor (CBF), consisting of a Runx protein and the CBFbeta protein, is a transcription factor complex that is essential for emergence of the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) from an endothelial cell stage. The hematopoietic defects observed in either Runx1 or CBFbeta knockout mice underscore the necessity of this complex for definitive hematopoiesis. Despite the requirement for CBF in establishing definitive hematopoiesis, Runx1 loss has minimal impact on maintaining the HSC state postnatally, while CBFbeta may continue to be essential. Lineage commitment, on the other hand, is significantly affected upon CBF loss in the adult, indicating a primary role for this complex in modulating differentiation. Given the impact of normal CBF function in the hematopoietic system, the severe consequences of disrupting CBF activity, either through point mutations or generation of fusion genes, are obvious. The physiologic role of CBF in differentiation is subverted to an active process of self-renewal maintenance by the genetic aberrations, through several possible mechanisms, contributing to the development of hematopoietic malignancies including myelodysplastic syndrome and leukemia. The major impact of CBF on the hematopoietic system in both development and disease highlights the need for understanding the intricate functions of this complex and reiterate the necessity of continued efforts to identify potential points of therapeutic intervention for CBF-related diseases.","['Link, Kevin A', 'Chou, Fu-Sheng', 'Mulloy, James C']","['Link KA', 'Chou FS', 'Mulloy JC']","[""Division of Experimental Hematology and Cancer Biology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, Ohio 45229, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",,United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,PMC2812028,2009/10/09 06:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/10/09 06:00'],"['2009/10/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jcp.21950 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 2010 Jan;222(1):50-6. doi: 10.1002/jcp.21950.,1,IM,"['Animals', '*Cell Lineage', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Core Binding Factors/*metabolism', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Repressor Proteins/metabolism']",90,"['0 (Core Binding Factors)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)']",,,"['R01 CA118319/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA118319-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA117846/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA118319/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,['NIHMS169824'],,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of this study was to evaluate if birth weight (BW) corrected-for-gestational age is a better predictor than BW alone for occurrence of ALL and other malignancies in children. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Birth certificate data of 2,254 children with cancer who were younger than 5 years old at diagnosis and registered at Texas Cancer Registry during 1995-2003 were compared to 11,734 age-matched controls. Multivariable logistic regression was used to compare models with BW corrected-for-gestational age and BW alone. RESULTS: Compared to children who were appropriate for gestational age (AGA), children who were large for gestational age (LGA) at birth had a 1.66 times (95% CI 1.32-2.10) higher odds of ALL. Similarly, children with a BW > or =4,000 g had a 1.5 times (95% CI 1.18-1.89) higher odds for ALL, compared to children who weighed >2,500 and <4,000 g at birth. Using model diagnostics, the model containing BW corrected-for-gestational age was a better predictor than the model with BW alone [Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC) 4,646 vs. 4,658, respectively]. Odds ratios (OR) were similar for LGA children who were <4,000 g and LGA children who were > or =4,000 g (OR = 1.5, 95% CI 0.97-2.5 and OR = 1.67, 95% CI 1.29-2.16, respectively). BW was not an independent risk factor for acute myeloid leukemia or brain tumors. CONCLUSION: BW corrected-for-gestational age is a better predictor than BW alone of risk for ALL. Future studies using BW variable should incorporate gestational age in their analyses.","['Sprehe, Michael R', 'Barahmani, Nadia', 'Cao, Yumei', 'Wang, Tao', 'Forman, Michele R', 'Bondy, Melissa', 'Okcu, M Fatih']","['Sprehe MR', 'Barahmani N', 'Cao Y', 'Wang T', 'Forman MR', 'Bondy M', 'Okcu MF']","[""Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine, Texas Children's Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,PMC2795053,2009/10/09 06:00,2010/01/27 06:00,['2009/10/09 06:00'],"['2009/10/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.22308 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2010 Feb;54(2):242-9. doi: 10.1002/pbc.22308.,2,IM,"['*Birth Weight', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Fetal Macrosomia', 'Gestational Age', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/epidemiology', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*epidemiology', 'Risk Factors', 'Texas/epidemiology']",,,"['(c) 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,"['R25 CA057730/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R25 CA057730-13/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R25 CA57730/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,['NIHMS144377'],,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between April 1997 and March 2005, 27 of 1,237 leukemic patients (2.2%) failed to achieve CR after four- or five-drug induction therapy. Twenty-three of these patients entered the F-protocol study, which mainly consisted of acute-myeloid-leukemia-oriented chemotherapy followed by scheduled hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). RESULTS: Seventeen (73.9%) of the 23 patients responded to re-induction chemotherapy with CR. Of note, 15 (93.8%) of 16 patients with Philadelphia-chromosome-negative (non-Ph(+)) ALL achieved CR; in contrast, only 2 (28.6%) of 7 Ph(+) patients achieved CR. Fourteen (82.4%) of 17 patients remained in CR (CCR) until their scheduled HCT, 12 of the 14 with CCR underwent HCT as scheduled, and 6 patients remain in first CR after a median of 78 months (range, 49-107 months). The 5-year overall survival (OS) rates of 16 patients with non-Ph(+) and 7 patients with Ph(+) were 43.8 +/- 12.4% and 14.3 +/- 13.2%, respectively (P = 0.012). The 5-year OS rate of the 17 patients who obtained CR by re-induction therapy and the 6 who did not were 47.1 +/- 12.1% and 0%, respectively (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Acute-myeloid-leukemia-oriented chemotherapy followed by scheduled HCT is a promising treatment strategy for non-Ph(+) ALL patients with IF.","['Suzuki, Nobuhiro', 'Yumura-Yagi, Keiko', 'Yoshida, Makoto', 'Hara, Junichi', 'Nishimura, Shinichiro', 'Kudoh, Tooru', 'Tawa, Akio', 'Usami, Ikuya', 'Tanizawa, Akihiko', 'Hori, Hiroki', 'Ito, Yasuhiko', 'Miyaji, Ryosuke', 'Oda, Megumi', 'Kato, Koji', 'Hamamoto, Kazuko', 'Osugi, Yuko', 'Hashii, Yoshiko', 'Nakahata, Tatsutoshi', 'Horibe, Keizo']","['Suzuki N', 'Yumura-Yagi K', 'Yoshida M', 'Hara J', 'Nishimura S', 'Kudoh T', 'Tawa A', 'Usami I', 'Tanizawa A', 'Hori H', 'Ito Y', 'Miyaji R', 'Oda M', 'Kato K', 'Hamamoto K', 'Osugi Y', 'Hashii Y', 'Nakahata T', 'Horibe K']","['Department of Pediatrics, Sapporo Medical University Hospital, Sapporo, Japan. nsuzuki@sapmed.ac.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,2009/10/09 06:00,2009/12/18 06:00,['2009/10/09 06:00'],"['2009/10/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.22217 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2010 Jan;54(1):71-8. doi: 10.1002/pbc.22217.,1,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/pathology/*therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,"['Copyright 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,['Japan Association of Childhood Leukemia Study (JACLS)'],,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was performed on two groups of patients. The first group consisted of 30 children who received CRT and ITMTX, and the second group was comprised of 15 children treated only with ITMTX. All patients were ALL survivors treated between 1994 and 2002. Radiotherapy was performed using two opposite fields for a total dose of 18 Gy. The children were examined from 6 to 12 years after treatment. All children underwent a physical and neurological examination and MRI/MRS studies. (1)H-MR spectra were acquired from frontal and occipital regions of the brain. Mean values and standard deviations were calculated for following metabolite ratios: NAA/Cr, Cho/Cr, Cho/NAA, and mI/Cr. RESULTS: Three of the 45 children (11%) presented with white matter changes upon MRI examination. All children with MRI abnormalities received CRT. In 13 (31%) children, changes in (1)H-MRS metabolite ratios were seen. We observed decreased NAA/Cr and Cho/Cr ratios. MR spectroscopy showed a significant reduction (P < .05) of the mean NAA/Cr ratio in children given CRT. CONCLUSION: MRS is a sensitive detector of late metabolic changes after prophylactic treatment for ALL in childhood. It is able to detect metabolic effects of treatment in patients even when no morphologic changes are visible upon MRI.","['Ficek, Kornelia', 'Blamek, Slawomir', 'Sygula, Dorota', 'Miszczyk, Leszek', 'Sonta-Jakimczyk, Danuta', 'Tarnawski, Rafal']","['Ficek K', 'Blamek S', 'Sygula D', 'Miszczyk L', 'Sonta-Jakimczyk D', 'Tarnawski R']","['Department of Radiotherapy, Center of Oncology Maria Sklodowska Curie Memorial Institute-Branch, Gliwice, Poland. bertaf@poczta.onet.pl']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Austria,Acta Neurochir Suppl,Acta neurochirurgica.

Besides their stringent validation, signatures need a functional interpretation and must be placed in a biological context. Popular tools such as Gene Set Enrichment have drawbacks because they are restricted to annotated genes and are unable to capture the information hidden in the signature's non-annotated genes. METHODOLOGY: We propose concepts to relate a signature with functional gene sets like pathways or Gene Ontology categories. The connection between single signature genes and a specific pathway is explored by hierarchical variable selection and gene association networks. The risk score derived from an individual patient's signature is related to expression patterns of pathways and Gene Ontology categories. Global tests are useful for these tasks, and they adjust for other factors. GlobalAncova is used to explore the effect on gene expression in specific functional groups from the interaction of the score and selected mutations in the patient's genome. RESULTS: We apply the proposed methods to an expression data set and a corresponding gene signature for predicting survival in Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML). The example demonstrates strong relations between the signature and cancer-related pathways. The signature-based risk score was found to be associated with development-related biological processes. CONCLUSIONS: Many authors interpret the functional aspects of a gene signature by linking signature genes to pathways or relevant functional gene groups. The method of gene set enrichment is preferred to annotating signature genes to specific Gene Ontology categories. The strategies proposed in this paper go beyond the restriction of annotation and deepen the insights into the biological mechanisms reflected in the information given by a signature.","['Hummel, Manuela', 'Metzeler, Klaus H', 'Buske, Christian', 'Bohlander, Stefan K', 'Mansmann, Ulrich']","['Hummel M', 'Metzeler KH', 'Buske C', 'Bohlander SK', 'Mansmann U']","['Department of Medical Informatics, Biometry and Epidemiology, University of Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20080922,United States,Bioinform Biol Insights,Bioinformatics and biology insights,101467187,PMC2735947,2008/01/01 00:00,2008/01/01 00:01,['2009/10/09 06:00'],"['2009/10/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2008/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.4137/bbi.s1018 [doi]'],epublish,Bioinform Biol Insights. 2008 Sep 22;2:329-41. doi: 10.4137/bbi.s1018.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we report the effects of the novel histone deacetylase inhibitor panobinostat (LBH589) in combination with doxorubicin on AML cells. Panobinostat exhibited potent anti-AML activity in all AML cell lines tested and in primary AML cells from patients (IC(50)<20 nM). In addition, panobinostat potentiated the action of several standard-of-care anti-AML compounds, particularly, doxorubicin. The molecular effects induced by panobinostat and doxorubicin treatment were investigated by analyzing gene expression, cell cycle, apoptosis and signaling pathways. Analyses of gene expression profiles identified 588 genes whose expression was exclusively affected by the combination of panobinostat and doxorubicin. The combination induced AML cell death by an increase in the mitochondrial outer membrane permeability and release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria, resulting in caspase-dependent apoptosis and accompanied by the upregulation of Bax, Bak and, particularly, Bad. The drug combination provoked a strong activation of a DNA damage response, indicating that this combination may trigger cell death by a mechanism that induced DNA double-strand breaks. These data indicate that the combination of panobinostat and doxorubicin may be an effective therapy for the treatment of AML.","['Maiso, P', 'Colado, E', 'Ocio, E M', 'Garayoa, M', 'Martin, J', 'Atadja, P', 'Pandiella, A', 'San-Miguel, J F']","['Maiso P', 'Colado E', 'Ocio EM', 'Garayoa M', 'Martin J', 'Atadja P', 'Pandiella A', 'San-Miguel JF']","['Department of Hematology, Centro de Investigacion del Cancer, Instituto de Biologia Molecular y Celular del Cancer/Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas, Universidad de Salamanca, Avda.

Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was used with break-apart dual-color probes. Sixty samples from 54 patients were analyzed with 23 C-ALCL, 11 transformed mycosis fungoides (T-MF), 7 lymphomatoid papulosis (LyP), and 13 Sezary syndrome (SS) cases. IRF4 immunostaining was performed in 32 cases. We observed a split FISH signal pattern indicating a translocation at the IRF4 locus in 6 out of 23 C-ALCL (26%) and 2 out of 11 T-MF (18.2%) cases. Extra copies of the IRF4 locus were found in 4 out of 13 SS, 1 out of 11 T-MF, and 1 out of 23 C-ALCL cases, corresponding to either aneuploidy, chromosome 6 trisomy, or 6p partial gain. The IRF4 expression was not correlated with the presence of IRF4 alteration in C-ALCL or T-MF. Interestingly, IRF4 rearrangements define a subgroup of CD30-positive C-ALCL and T-MF cases. Conversely, T-MF cases with IRF4 rearrangements may correspond to the development of C-ALCL in MF patients and not to large cell transformation. Investigation of the biological pathways triggered by IRF4 rearrangements and/or expression in CTCL will provide a biological basis for IRF4-directed therapy.","['Pham-Ledard, Anne', 'Prochazkova-Carlotti, Martina', 'Laharanne, Elodie', 'Vergier, Beatrice', 'Jouary, Thomas', 'Beylot-Barry, Marie', 'Merlio, Jean-Philippe']","['Pham-Ledard A', 'Prochazkova-Carlotti M', 'Laharanne E', 'Vergier B', 'Jouary T', 'Beylot-Barry M', 'Merlio JP']","['Department of Histology and Molecular Pathology of Tumors, University Bordeaux 2, and Department of Dermatology, Hopital Saint Andre, Bordeaux, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091008,United States,J Invest Dermatol,The Journal of investigative dermatology,0426720,,2009/10/09 06:00,2010/03/20 06:00,['2009/10/09 06:00'],"['2009/10/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/20 06:00 [medline]']","['S0022-202X(15)34748-5 [pii]', '10.1038/jid.2009.314 [doi]']",ppublish,J Invest Dermatol. 2010 Mar;130(3):816-25. doi: 10.1038/jid.2009.314.

Results associated with intensive chemotherapy remain disappointing, at least in nonselected patients. On the contrary, there are still no real standard alternatives even if some new approaches seem promising. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent studies aim to guide the selection of patients likely to benefit from intensive chemotherapy; to optimize remission induction and maintenance in those patients; and to evaluate long-term results associated with alternative therapies. Main results are the following: favorable AML subsets identified in younger patients remain favorable in elderly patients and might benefit from a relatively intensified treatment; if daunorubicin is used for induction, a dose higher than 45 mg/m2 x 3 results in a higher complete remission rate and longer survival, at least until 65 years of age; repeated intensive postremission courses do not seem to be effective in older patients; and median survival observed after clofarabine or azacitidine-based therapy could be long enough to deserve prospective comparisons against conventional chemotherapy. SUMMARY: These new results may help to offer a personalized management to elderly patients with AML and to design future trials.","['Dombret, Herve', 'Raffoux, Emmanuel', 'Gardin, Claude']","['Dombret H', 'Raffoux E', 'Gardin C']","['Department of Clinical Hematology and Immunology, Hopital Saint-Louis, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, EA 3518 Universite Paris 7, Paris, France. herve.dombret@sls.aphp.fr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Oncol,Current opinion in oncology,9007265,,2009/10/09 06:00,2010/01/16 06:00,['2009/10/09 06:00'],"['2009/10/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/CCO.0b013e3283313e10 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Oncol. 2009 Nov;21(6):589-93. doi: 10.1097/CCO.0b013e3283313e10.,6,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Aged', '*Health Services for the Aged', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*therapy', 'Outcome Assessment, Health Care', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction']",28,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Herein, we review therapies that have proven effective as well as newer agents that have recently improved GVHD response rates and survival following HCT. RECENT FINDINGS: Novel approaches to prevent or treat GVHD are often based on evidence from experimental models. Our understanding of the pathophysiology of GVHD may lead to the development of innovative strategies that target both soluble and cellular effectors. Among such agents are sirolimus, anti-tumor necrosis factor antibodies, anti-LFA-3-IgG fusion protein, extracorporeal photopheresis, mesenchymal stem cells and regulatory T cells. SUMMARY: Obstacles to the improvement of HCT include the tight linkage between GVHD toxicity and the beneficial graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect, as well as the impairment of immune reconstitution by immunomodulatory drugs leading to life-threatening infections. The design of newer phase I/II clinical trials are underway. Future therapies are likely to include modulation of cell types that play key roles in the GVH process, including regulatory T cells, dendritic cells, natural killer T cells and B cells.","['Paczesny, Sophie', 'Choi, Sung W', 'Ferrara, James L M']","['Paczesny S', 'Choi SW', 'Ferrara JL']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109-5942, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,PMC3943343,2009/10/09 06:00,2010/01/07 06:00,['2009/10/09 06:00'],"['2009/10/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/MOH.0b013e3283319a6f [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2009 Nov;16(6):427-36. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0b013e3283319a6f.,6,IM,"['*Graft vs Host Disease/prevention & control/therapy', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/trends', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Factors/*therapeutic use']",140,['0 (Immunologic Factors)'],,,"['P01 CA039542/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'RC1 HL101102/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,['NIHMS378068'],,,,,,,,,,

Therapeutic radiation has been instrumental in this success. Unfortunately, irradiation is associated with untoward effects, including stroke and other cerebrovascular disease (CVD). The Children's Oncology Group (COG) has developed guidelines for screening survivors at risk for persistent or late sequelae of cancer therapy. OBJECTIVES: This review summarizes the pathophysiology and relevant manifestations of radiation-induced CVD and outlines the specific patient groups at risk for early-onset stroke. The reader will be alerted to the availability of the COG recommendations for monitoring, and, when applicable, specific screening and treatment recommendations will be highlighted. METHODS: A multidisciplinary task force critically reviewed the existing literature and scored the evidence to establish the current COG guidelines for monitoring health of survivors treated with head and neck irradiation. RESULTS: Previous head and neck exposure to therapeutic radiation is associated with latent CVD and increased risk for stroke in some patient groups. Common manifestations of radiation-induced CVD includes steno-occlusive disease, moyamoya, aneurysm, mineralizing microangiopathy, vascular malformations, and strokelike migraines. CONCLUSION: Risk for stroke is increased in survivors of pediatric CNS tumors, Hodgkin lymphoma, and acute lymphoblastic leukemia who received radiation to the brain and/or neck. As the population of survivors ages, vigilance for stroke and cerebrovascular disease needs to continue based on specific exposures during curative cancer therapy.","['Morris, B', 'Partap, S', 'Yeom, K', 'Gibbs, I C', 'Fisher, P G', 'King, A A']","['Morris B', 'Partap S', 'Yeom K', 'Gibbs IC', 'Fisher PG', 'King AA']","[""Divisions of Neurology and Cancer Survivorship, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA. brannon.morris@stjude.org""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", 'Review']",20091007,United States,Neurology,Neurology,0401060,PMC2788797,2009/10/09 06:00,2009/12/23 06:00,['2009/10/09 06:00'],"['2009/10/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/23 06:00 [medline]']","['WNL.0b013e3181c17ea8 [pii]', '10.1212/WNL.0b013e3181c17ea8 [doi]']",ppublish,Neurology. 2009 Dec 1;73(22):1906-13. doi: 10.1212/WNL.0b013e3181c17ea8.

We hypothesize that reactive oxygen species (ROS) contribute to the deregulation of fetal hematopoiesis caused by in utero benzene exposure. To evaluate this hypothesis, pregnant C57Bl/6N mice were exposed to benzene or polyethylene glycol-conjugated catalase (PEG-catalase) (antioxidative enzyme) and benzene. Colony formation assays on fetal liver cells were performed to measure erythroid and myeloid progenitor cell growth potential. The presence of ROS in CD117(+) fetal liver cells was measured by flow cytometric analysis. Oxidative cellular damage was assessed by Western blot analysis of 4-hydroxynonenol (4-HNE) and nitrotyrosine products, as well as reduced to oxidized glutathione ratios. Alterations in the redox-sensitive signaling pathway nuclear factor-kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kappaB) were measured by Western blot analysis of Inhibitor of NF-kB-alpha (IkappaB-alpha) protein levels in fetal liver tissue. In utero exposure to benzene caused a significant increase in ROS production and significantly altered fetal liver erythroid and myeloid colony numbers but did not increase the levels of 4-HNE or nitrotyrosine products or alter reduced to oxidized glutathione ratios. However, in utero exposure to benzene did cause a significant decrease in fetal liver IkappaB-alpha protein levels, suggesting activation of the NF-kappaB pathway. Benzene-induced ROS formation, abnormal colony growth, and decreased IkappaB-alpha levels were all abrogated by pretreatment with PEG-catalase. These results suggest that ROS play a key role in the development of in utero-initiated benzene toxicity potentially through disruption of hematopoietic cell signaling pathways.","['Badham, Helen J', 'Winn, Louise M']","['Badham HJ', 'Winn LM']","[""Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario, Canada K7L 3N6.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091007,United States,Toxicol Sci,Toxicological sciences : an official journal of the Society of Toxicology,9805461,,2009/10/09 06:00,2010/02/23 06:00,['2009/10/09 06:00'],"['2009/10/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/23 06:00 [medline]']","['kfp242 [pii]', '10.1093/toxsci/kfp242 [doi]']",ppublish,Toxicol Sci. 2010 Jan;113(1):207-15. doi: 10.1093/toxsci/kfp242.

The proteasome inhibitor bortezomib has recently been approved for the treatment of relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma. In this study, we investigated the induction of apoptosis by proteasome inhibitors in several human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines and in primary cells from patients. We demonstrate that these drugs induce a high level of apoptosis in the KG1a cell line, in which the therapeutic drug daunorubicin is poorly active, compared to other AML cell lines. In parallel, we found that significantly different levels of apoptosis were induced in primary cells from patients depending on the FAB-based differentiation status of these cells. Moreover, the level of 20S proteasome in KG1a cells was also high compared to other AML cell lines, suggesting a relationship between the high sensitivity to proteasome inhibitors and an elevated amount of 20S proteasome. In good accordance, we identified two groups of patient cells expressing high and low levels of 20S proteasome, with respective high and low sensitivity to proteasome inhibitors. Further comparison of the proteasome status in KG1a and U937 cells also suggests that a high proportion of the 19S regulatory complex in U937 cells compared to the 20S core complex may explain an increased proteasome activity. Altogether, our results suggest that various AML subtypes may present different responses to proteasome inhibitors, that these molecules can be potentially considered as interesting therapeutic alternatives for these pathologies, and that the amount of 20S proteasome in AML cells may be predictive of the cellular response to these inhibitors.","['Matondo, Mariette', 'Bousquet-Dubouch, Marie-Pierre', 'Gallay, Nathalie', 'Uttenweiler-Joseph, Sandrine', 'Recher, Christian', 'Payrastre, Bernard', 'Manenti, Stephane', 'Monsarrat, Bernard', 'Burlet-Schiltz, Odile']","['Matondo M', 'Bousquet-Dubouch MP', 'Gallay N', 'Uttenweiler-Joseph S', 'Recher C', 'Payrastre B', 'Manenti S', 'Monsarrat B', 'Burlet-Schiltz O']","['CNRS, Institut de Pharmacologie et de Biologie Structurale, 205 route de Narbonne, F-31077 Toulouse, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091006,England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,,2009/10/09 06:00,2010/03/27 06:00,['2009/10/09 06:00'],"['2008/10/20 00:00 [received]', '2009/09/07 00:00 [revised]', '2009/09/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/10/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/27 06:00 [medline]']","['S0145-2126(09)00480-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2009.09.020 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2010 Apr;34(4):498-506. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2009.09.020.

Flow cytometry was used to analyze the cell cycle and apoptosis. RESULTS: 0.15-0.6 mg/L arsenic sulfide (72 h)can induce apoptosis and inhibit telomerase activity and hTERT-mRNA expression in NB4 cell.

Transcriptional regulators, such as Oct4, are critical for pluripotency, but the role of epigenetic modifiers remains to be fully elucidated. RESULTS: Here, we show that ERG-associated protein with SET domain (ESET), a histone methyltransferase enzyme, maintains pluripotency through repression of Cdx2, a key trophectoderm determinant, by histone H3 lysine 9 trimethylation (H3K9me3) of the promoter region. Notably, this repression is mediated through the synergistic function of small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO)ylated ESET and Oct4. ESET localises to the promyelocytic leukaemia (PML) nuclear bodies and is SUMOylated in ES cells. Interaction of ESET with Oct4 depends on a SUMO-interacting motif (SIM) in Oct4, which is critical for the repression of Cdx2. CONCLUSION: Loss of ESET or Oct4 results in strikingly similar phenotypes both in ES cells with their differentiation into trophectoderm cells, and in early embryos where there is a failure of development of the pluripotent inner cell mass (ICM) of blastocysts. We propose that SUMOylated ESET-Oct4 complex is critical for both the initiation and maintenance of pluripotency through repression of differentiation, particularly of the trophectoderm lineage by epigenetic silencing of Cdx2.","['Yeap, Leng-Siew', 'Hayashi, Katsuhiko', 'Surani, M Azim']","['Yeap LS', 'Hayashi K', 'Surani MA']","['Wellcome Trust/Cancer Research UK Gurdon Institute, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK. lsy20@cam.ac.uk']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20091007,England,Epigenetics Chromatin,Epigenetics & chromatin,101471619,PMC2763847,2009/10/09 06:00,2009/10/09 06:01,['2009/10/09 06:00'],"['2009/09/23 00:00 [received]', '2009/10/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/10/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/09 06:01 [medline]']","['1756-8935-2-12 [pii]', '10.1186/1756-8935-2-12 [doi]']",epublish,Epigenetics Chromatin. 2009 Oct 7;2(1):12. doi: 10.1186/1756-8935-2-12.,1,,,,,,,['G0800784/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

We wished to identify whether there was an association between MCV, red cell folate and haematological toxicity in patients on MTX monotherapy for the long-term management of RA. METHODS: Evidence of haematological toxicity was sought by note review of patients recruited in a cross-sectional study of MTX monotherapy in RA. Retrospective data included MCVs from before MTX initiation and after 3 and 6 months of treatment. Data were collected prospectively every 6 months for up to 2 years after enrolment. Any record of cytopenia or the development of haematological malignancy was recorded from commencement of MTX until the present day. Red cell folate concentrations were tested on enrolment to the study. RESULTS: A total of 165 patients was included, 74.5% female, median disease duration 7 years (range 3 months-57 years). The median duration of MTX treatment was 74.9 months (range 10-241 months) giving 1030.2 patient-years of MTX exposure. Twenty-four patients (14.5%) had a MCV > 98 fL on study entry. Evidence of haematological abnormality was found in six patients (3.6%); chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (1), persistent lymphocytosis (1), persistent monocytosis (1) and neutropenia (3). There was no association between red cell folate or MCV and haematological toxicity. CONCLUSION: Neutropenia and pancytopenia are rare side-effects of MTX therapy in this cohort. Elevated MCV or low mean red cell folate does not appear to be associated with haematological malignancy or toxicity in this cohort of patients on long-term MTX therapy.","['White, D H N', 'Chapman, P T', ""O'Donnell, J L"", 'James, J', 'Frampton, C', 'Stamp, L K']","['White DH', 'Chapman PT', ""O'Donnell JL"", 'James J', 'Frampton C', 'Stamp LK']","['Department of Rheumatology, Immunology and Allergy, Canterbury District Health Board, Christchurch, New Zealand.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091007,Australia,Intern Med J,Internal medicine journal,101092952,,2009/10/09 06:00,2011/05/20 06:00,['2009/10/09 06:00'],"['2009/10/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/05/20 06:00 [medline]']","['IMJ2059 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1445-5994.2009.02059.x [doi]']",ppublish,Intern Med J. 2010 Aug;40(8):561-5. doi: 10.1111/j.1445-5994.2009.02059.x.

But as some myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients with +8 perhaps progress quickly to acute leukaemia and have shorter survival, some reports have suggested that +8 should be categorized into poor risk cytogenetic group. The aim of this study was to clarify the prognostic role of +8 in MDS patients by comparing patients with normal karyotype, 20q- and -7/7q-. METHODS: The consecutive samples of 435 MDS patients in Shanghai were collected by prospective methods and diagnosed according to World Health Organization classification. Cytogenetic analysis was performed using conventional G-banding karyotyping and fluorescence in situ hybridization techniques. Prognosis was estimated by univariate Log-rank method and multivariate Cox proportional hazard models. RESULTS: Of 424 cases completing the cytogenetic analysis, 71 (16.7%) had +8, including 38 patients with sole +8 (9.0%). No significant difference in median survival was observed between patients with sole +8 and that with +8 and one of other abnormalities. The +8 clone size was not linked to survival. The median survival of patients with +8, normal karyotype and complex karyotype was 25months, 38.1months and 5.9months respectively.

Pooled odds ratios (ORs) were assessed using both fixed- and random-effects models. Heterogeneity across studies was calculated, and funnel plots were constructed to test for publication bias. Overall, the random-effects OR with GSTM1 null genotype, GSTP1 Val105 allele and GSTT1 null genotype were 1.30 (95% confidence intervals (CI) 1.04-1.62, p = 0.018), 1.03 (95% CI 0.80-1.33, p = 0.80) and 1.24 (95% CI 0.98-1.58, p = 0.06), respectively. Statistically, significant increased risk of AML was observed with GSTM1 while borderline significance was seen with GSTT1 null genotypes. However, fixed-effects model showed significant risk of AML in the presence of null genotypes of GSTM1 and GSTT1(p < 0.05). Significant heterogeneity was found between studies relating to GSTP1 (p = 0.162), however, no heterogeneity was seen in studies that evaluated GSTM1 (Q-value = 44; I(2) = 70.9; p-value < 0.01]; and GSTT1 (Q-value = 26.03; I(2) = 57.74; p-value < 0.01] polymorphisms. From the limited studies on the association of GSTP1 with risk of AML, the role of this gene cannot be ascertained fully. Significant association of these three genes with risk of AML must be evaluated further with respect to population, smoking, eating habits, ethnicity, and race.","['Das, Prabhavathy', 'Shaik, Abjal Pasha', 'Bammidi, Vamsee K']","['Das P', 'Shaik AP', 'Bammidi VK']","['Mahavir Hospital and Research Centre, Masab Tank, Andhra Pradesh, India.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis']",,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,2009/10/09 06:00,2010/03/10 06:00,['2009/10/09 06:00'],"['2009/10/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/10 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1080/10428190903003236 [pii]', '10.1080/10428190903003236 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2009 Aug;50(8):1345-51. doi: 10.1080/10428190903003236.,8,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Alleles', 'Carcinogens/pharmacokinetics', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Confounding Factors, Epidemiologic', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genotype', 'Glutathione S-Transferase pi/*genetics', 'Glutathione Transferase/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/enzymology/epidemiology/*genetics', 'Models, Genetic', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Odds Ratio', '*Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Risk', 'Selection Bias']",,"['0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', 'EC 2.5.1.- (glutathione S-transferase T1)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (GSTP1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione S-Transferase pi)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (glutathione S-transferase M1)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Whether the HCMV-mediated induction of this specific NK cell subset is also apparent for other diseases characterized by abnormal immune responses, such as malignant blood diseases, is unknown. By comparing the fractions of CD94/NKG2C(+) NK cells in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) patients having either positive or negative HCMV serostatus, a proportional increase of this cell subset was obvious in the HCMV-seropositive subjects.

The introduction of imatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor mainly targeting BCR-ABL, c-KIT and PDGFR, has profoundly improved the prognosis of both entities, while being surprisingly well tolerated. This article summarizes recent data on clinical efficacy as well as safety aspects of imatinib for treatment of CML and GIST, including a final benefit-risk assessment. Imatinib induces high rates of cytogenetic and molecular responses in all phases of CML and also has substantial activity in GIST patients. In both diseases, only a few adverse effects, such as musculoskeletal and joint pain, muscle cramps, oedema and gastrointestinal symptoms, occur. Most of these are grade I or II toxicities and generally occur during the early phase of treatment (i.e. within the first 2 years). Thus, in view of the low rates of severe toxicities and the extraordinary efficacy of the drug in both diseases, imatinib represents an oral drug with a high benefit-risk ratio for the treatment of CML and GIST.","['Wolf, Dominik', 'Rumpold, Holger']","['Wolf D', 'Rumpold H']","['Internal Medicine V, Department of Hematology and Oncology, and Tyrolean Cancer Research Institute, Medical University Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria. dominik.wolf@i-med.ac.at']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,New Zealand,Drug Saf,Drug safety,9002928,,2009/10/09 06:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/10/09 06:00'],"['2009/10/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['2 [pii]', '10.2165/11314600-000000000-00000 [doi]']",ppublish,Drug Saf. 2009;32(11):1001-15. doi: 10.2165/11314600-000000000-00000.,11,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Breast Feeding', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Drug Interactions', 'Female', 'Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors/*drug therapy/physiopathology', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/physiopathology', 'Piperazines/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications, Neoplastic/drug therapy', 'Pyrimidines/adverse effects/*therapeutic use']",60,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We studied 199 episodes of febrile neutropenia in 80 children with malignancies, treated by conventional chemotherapy for a 4-year period (2000 - 2004). A standardized computer database with a set of variables for each febrile neutropenic episode was used. C-reactive protein (CRP) was measured at the first febrile episode and on the 3rd and 5th day from the beginning of antibiotic therapy by immunoturbidimetric method. Blood cultures were taken at the onset of fever and before initiation of antibiotic therapy. RESULTS: Multivariate logistic regression analysis determined 5 variables as independent risk factors for bacteremia: the underlying malignant disease (leukemia, non - Hodgkin's lymphoma / NHL, stage IV), chills, perianal cellulitis, presence of central venous catheter and CRP rise >or=34.5 mg/L between the onset of fever and the 3rd day of empiric antibiotic therapy. Thus we identified a low-risk group for bacteremia of 19.1%. CONCLUSION: Serial measurement of CRP allows for definite risk stratification of febrile neutropenic episodes on the 3rd day from the onset of fever. The low-risk group could be eligible for sequential empiric antibiotic therapy.","['Spasova, M I', 'Grudeva-Popova, J G', 'Kostyanev, S S', 'Genev, E D', 'Stoyanova, A A', 'Kirina, V I', 'Moumdjiev, I N']","['Spasova MI', 'Grudeva-Popova JG', 'Kostyanev SS', 'Genev ED', 'Stoyanova AA', 'Kirina VI', 'Moumdjiev IN']","['Department of Pediatrics, Oncohematology Ward, Medical University, Plovdiv, Bulgaria. merispa@mail.bg']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Cyprus,J BUON,Journal of B.U.ON. : official journal of the Balkan Union of Oncology,100883428,,2009/10/08 06:00,2010/02/24 06:00,['2009/10/08 06:00'],"['2009/10/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/24 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,J BUON. 2009 Jul-Sep;14(3):411-8.,3,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Bacteremia/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Bacteria/growth & development', 'C-Reactive Protein/metabolism', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Fever/*epidemiology/microbiology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Neutropenia/*chemically induced/complications', 'Prospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Young Adult']",,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '9007-41-4 (C-Reactive Protein)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The cancer incidence cases and rates were calculated from the Korea National Cancer Incidence Database. Crude and age-standardized incidence rates were calculated by gender for specified cancer sites in 5-year age groups. RESULTS: From 2003 to 2005, 398,824 cases of cancer were newly diagnosed in Korea (218,856 in men and 179,968 in women). For all sites combined, the crude incidence rate (CR) was 300.0 and 248.2 for men and women and the age-standardized incidence rate (ASR) was 297.0 and 191.2 per 100,000, respectively. Among men, five leading cancers were stomach (CR 66.0, ASR 64.2), lung (CR 48.5, ASR 50.3), liver (CR 44.9, ASR 42.1), colon and rectum (CR 37.9, ASR 37.2), and prostate cancer (CR 12.7, ASR 13.8). Among women, five leading cancers were breast (CR 37.3, ASR 29.0), thyroid (CR 36.2, ASR 28.8), stomach (CR 34.1, ASR 25.4), colon and rectum (CR 28.0, ASR 21.1), and lung cancer (CR 17.9, ASR 12.8). In the 0~14-year-old group, leukemia was the most common in both sexes; in the 15~34 group, the most common cancer was stomach cancer for men and thyroid cancer for women; in the 35~64 group, stomach cancer for men and breast cancer for women; among those 65 and over, lung cancer for men and stomach cancer, for women, respectively. CONCLUSION: The cancer incidence rates have increased in recent years, and more cancers are expected to develop as Korea is quickly becoming an aged society.

Regarding the apoptotic signaling pathways of spongistatin 1, we present two major facts. Firstly, spongistatin 1-induced cell death, mainly caspase-independent, involves the proapoptotic proteins apoptosis-inducing factor and endonuclease G. Both proteins translocate from mitochondria to the nucleus and contribute to spongistatin 1-mediated apoptosis as shown via gene silencing. Secondly, spongistatin 1 acts as a tubulin depolymerizing agent and is able to free the proapoptotic Bcl-2 family member Bim from its sequestration both by the microtubular complex and by the antiapoptotic protein Mcl-1. Silencing of Bim by small interfering RNA leads to a diminished translocation of apoptosis-inducing factor and endonuclease G to the nucleus and subsequently reduces apoptosis rate. Thus, we identified Bim as an important factor upstream of mitochondria executing a central role in the caspase-independent apoptotic signaling pathway induced by spongistatin 1. Taken together, spongistatin 1 is both a valuable tool for the characterization of apoptotic pathways and a promising experimental anticancer drug.","['Schneiders, Uta M', 'Schyschka, Lilianna', 'Rudy, Anita', 'Vollmar, Angelika M']","['Schneiders UM', 'Schyschka L', 'Rudy A', 'Vollmar AM']","['Department of Pharmacy, Center for Drug Research, University of Munich, Butenandtstrasse 5-13, D-81377 Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091006,United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,,2009/10/08 06:00,2010/01/13 06:00,['2009/10/08 06:00'],"['2009/10/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/13 06:00 [medline]']","['1535-7163.MCT-08-1179 [pii]', '10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-08-1179 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2009 Oct;8(10):2914-25. doi: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-08-1179.

Despite numerous reports showing the proapoptotic capacity and the inhibition of NF-kappaB-mediated transcription by triptolide, the identity of its cellular target is still unknown. To clarify its mechanism of action, we further investigated the effect of triptolide on RNA synthesis in the human non-small cell lung cancer cell line A549. Triptolide inhibited both total RNA and mRNA de novo synthesis, with the primary action being on the latter pool. We used 44K human pan-genomic DNA microarrays and identified the genes primarily affected by a short treatment with triptolide. Among the modulated genes, up to 98% are down-regulated, encompassing a large array of oncogenes including transcription factors and cell cycle regulators. We next observed that triptolide induced a rapid depletion of RPB1, the RNA polymerase II main subunit that is considered a hallmark of a transcription elongation blockage. However, we also show that triptolide does not directly interact with the RNA polymerase II complex nor does it damage DNA. We thus conclude that triptolide is an original pharmacologic inhibitor of RNA polymerase activity, affecting indirectly the transcription machinery, leading to a rapid depletion of short-lived mRNA, including transcription factors, cell cycle regulators such as CDC25A, and the oncogenes MYC and Src. Overall, the data shed light on the effect of triptolide on transcription, along with its novel potential applications in cancers, including acute myeloid leukemia, which is in part driven by the aforementioned oncogenic factors.","['Vispe, Stephane', 'DeVries, Luc', 'Creancier, Laurent', 'Besse, Jerome', 'Breand, Sophie', 'Hobson, David J', 'Svejstrup, Jesper Q', 'Annereau, Jean-Philippe', 'Cussac, Didier', 'Dumontet, Charles', 'Guilbaud, Nicolas', 'Barret, Jean-Marc', 'Bailly, Christian']","['Vispe S', 'DeVries L', 'Creancier L', 'Besse J', 'Breand S', 'Hobson DJ', 'Svejstrup JQ', 'Annereau JP', 'Cussac D', 'Dumontet C', 'Guilbaud N', 'Barret JM', 'Bailly C']","['Centre de Recherche en Oncologie Experimentale, Institut de Recherche Pierre Fabre, 3 rue des satellites, BP94244, Toulouse Cedex 4, 31432 France. stephane.vispe@pierre-fabre.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20091006,United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,,2009/10/08 06:00,2010/01/13 06:00,['2009/10/08 06:00'],"['2009/10/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/13 06:00 [medline]']","['1535-7163.MCT-09-0549 [pii]', '10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-09-0549 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2009 Oct;8(10):2780-90. doi: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-09-0549.

During apoptosis, the DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) is activated. DNA-PK is involved in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) and its catalytic subunit is associated with the nuclease ARTEMIS. Here, we report that, on initiation of apoptosis in human cells by agents causing DNA DSB or by staurosporine or other agents, ARTEMIS binds to apoptotic chromatin together with DNA-PK and other DSB repair proteins. ARTEMIS recruitment to chromatin showed a time and dose dependency. It required DNA-PK protein kinase activity and was blocked by antagonizing the onset of apoptosis with a pan-caspase inhibitor or on overexpression of the antiapoptotic BCL2 protein. In the absence of ARTEMIS, no defect in caspase-3, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1, and XRCC4 cleavage or in H2AX phosphorylation was observed and DNA-PK catalytic subunit was still phosphorylated on S2056 in response to staurosporine. However, DNA fragmentation including high molecular weight fragmentation was delayed in ARTEMIS-deficient cells compared with cells expressing ARTEMIS. In addition, ARTEMIS enhanced the kinetics of MLL gene cleavage at a breakage cluster breakpoint that is frequently translocated in acute or therapy-related leukemias. These results show a facilitating role for ARTEMIS at least in early, site-specific chromosome breakage during apoptosis.","['Britton, Sebastien', 'Frit, Philippe', 'Biard, Denis', 'Salles, Bernard', 'Calsou, Patrick']","['Britton S', 'Frit P', 'Biard D', 'Salles B', 'Calsou P']","['CNRS, Institut de Pharmacologie et de Biologie Structurale, Universite de Toulouse, UPS, Institut de Pharmacologie et de Biologie Structurale, Toulouse, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091006,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,,2009/10/08 06:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/10/08 06:00'],"['2009/10/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['0008-5472.CAN-08-4400 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-4400 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2009 Oct 15;69(20):8120-6. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-4400.

Although bone marrow aspiration and light microscopy remain the current standard of care for detecting residual disease, these approaches cannot reliably discriminate less than 5% lymphoblast cells. To improve the detection of leukemia cells in the marrow, we developed a novel apparatus that utilizes antibodies conjugated to superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPION) and directed against the acute leukemia antigen CD34, coupled with a ""magnetic needle"" biopsy. Leukemia cell lines expressing high or minimal CD34 were incubated with anti-CD34-conjugated SPIONs. Three separate approaches including microscopy, superconducting quantum interference device magnetometry, and in vitro magnetic needle extraction were then used to assess cell sampling. We found that CD34-conjugated nanoparticles preferentially bind high CD34-expressing cell lines. Furthermore, the magnetic needle enabled identification of both cell line and patient leukemia cells diluted into normal blood at concentrations below those normally found in remission marrow samples. Finally, the magnetic needle enhanced the percentage of lymphoblasts detectable by light microscopy by 10-fold in samples of fresh bone marrow aspirate approximating minimal residual disease. These data suggest that bone marrow biopsy using antigen-targeted magnetic nanoparticles and a magnetic needle for the evaluation of minimal residual disease in CD34-positive acute leukemias can significantly enhance sensitivity compared with the current standard of care.","['Jaetao, Jason E', 'Butler, Kimberly S', 'Adolphi, Natalie L', 'Lovato, Debbie M', 'Bryant, Howard C', 'Rabinowitz, Ian', 'Winter, Stuart S', 'Tessier, Trace E', 'Hathaway, Helen J', 'Bergemann, Christian', 'Flynn, Edward R', 'Larson, Richard S']","['Jaetao JE', 'Butler KS', 'Adolphi NL', 'Lovato DM', 'Bryant HC', 'Rabinowitz I', 'Winter SS', 'Tessier TE', 'Hathaway HJ', 'Bergemann C', 'Flynn ER', 'Larson RS']","['Department of Pathology, University of New Mexico and Cancer Research and Treatment Center, Albuquerque, New Mexico 87131, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20091006,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,PMC2783727,2009/10/08 06:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/10/08 06:00'],"['2009/10/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['0008-5472.CAN-09-1083 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-09-1083 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2009 Nov 1;69(21):8310-6. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-09-1083.

We investigated whether the activation of DNA repair pathways influences HBV replication. The upregulation of the promyelocytic leukemia (PML) protein and its associated PML nuclear body (PML-NB) by chemotherapy and irradiation-induced DNA repair signaling correlated with the upregulation of HBV pregenomic transcription, HBV-core expression, and HBV DNA replication. The HBV-core protein and HBV DNA localized to PML-NBs, where they associated with PML and histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1). Chemotherapy and radiotherapy affected the interactions between PML, HBV-core, and HDAC1. The enhanced protein-protein interaction between PML and HBV-core inhibited PML-mediated apoptosis and decreased PML-associated HDAC activity. The reversal of HDAC-mediated repression on the HBV covalently closed circular DNA basal core promoter resulted in the amplification of HBV-core and pregenomic expression. These results suggest that PML in PML-NBs links the DNA damage response with HBV replication and may cooperate with HBV-core and HDAC1 on the HBV covalently closed circular DNA basal core promoter to form a positive feedback loop for HBV exacerbation during chemotherapy and radiotherapy.","['Chung, Yih-Lin', 'Tsai, Tzung-Yuan']","['Chung YL', 'Tsai TY']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, Koo Foundation Sun Yat-Sen Cancer Center, Taipei, Taiwan. ylchung@kfsyscc.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091006,United States,Mol Cancer Res,Molecular cancer research : MCR,101150042,,2009/10/08 06:00,2010/02/13 06:00,['2009/10/08 06:00'],"['2009/10/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/13 06:00 [medline]']","['1541-7786.MCR-09-0112 [pii]', '10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-09-0112 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Res. 2009 Oct;7(10):1672-85. doi: 10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-09-0112.

Clinically, besides chemotherapy, two drugs induce clinical remissions: retinoic acid (RA) and arsenic trioxide (As). Both agents directly target PML/RARA-mediated transcriptional repression and protein stability, inducing to various extent promyelocyte differentiation and clinical remission of APL patients. RA targets the RARA moiety of the fusion, whereas arsenic targets its PML part. PML/RARA expression in the mouse is sufficient to initiate APL. The RA-As association, which synergizes for PML/RARA degradation but not for differentiation, rapidly clears leukemia initiating cells (LIC), resulting in APL eradication in murine APL models, but also in several APL clinical trials. Cyclic AMP triggered PML/RARA phosphorylation also enhances RA-induced APL regression, PML/RARA degradation, and LIC clearance, raising new options for therapy-resistant patients.

In humans, hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) express MCL-1 at the highest level in response to FMS-like tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3) signaling. We here show that this FLT3-dependent stem cell maintenance system also plays a critical role in survival of leukemic stem cells (LSCs) in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The CD34(+)CD38(-) LSC fraction expresses high levels of FLT3 as well as MCL-1, even compared with normal HSCs. Treatment with FLT3 ligand induced further MCL-1 up-regulation in LSCs in all AML cases tested. Interestingly, the group of samples expressing the highest levels of MCL-1 constituted AML with FLT3-internal tandem duplications (ITD). In FLT3-ITD AML cell lines, cells expressed a high level of MCL-1, and an inhibition of MCL-1 induced their apoptotic cell death. A tyrosine kinase inhibitor suppressed MCL-1 expression, and induced apoptosis that was reversed by the enforced MCL-1 expression. Finally, transduction of FLT3-ITD into HSCs strongly activated MCL-1 expression through its signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5)-docking domains. This effect was completely abrogated when STAT5 activation was blocked. Thus, the acquisition of FLT3-ITD ensures LSC survival by up-regulating MCL-1 via constitutive STAT5 activation that is independent of wild-type FLT3 signaling.","['Yoshimoto, Goichi', 'Miyamoto, Toshihiro', 'Jabbarzadeh-Tabrizi, Siamak', 'Iino, Tadafumi', 'Rocnik, Jennifer L', 'Kikushige, Yoshikane', 'Mori, Yasuo', 'Shima, Takahiro', 'Iwasaki, Hiromi', 'Takenaka, Katsuto', 'Nagafuji, Koji', 'Mizuno, Shin-ichi', 'Niiro, Hiroaki', 'Gilliland, Gary D', 'Akashi, Koichi']","['Yoshimoto G', 'Miyamoto T', 'Jabbarzadeh-Tabrizi S', 'Iino T', 'Rocnik JL', 'Kikushige Y', 'Mori Y', 'Shima T', 'Iwasaki H', 'Takenaka K', 'Nagafuji K', 'Mizuno S', 'Niiro H', 'Gilliland GD', 'Akashi K']","['Medicine and Biosystemic Science, Kyushu University Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Fukuoka 812-8582, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091006,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,PMC2788977,2009/10/08 06:00,2010/01/06 06:00,['2009/10/08 06:00'],"['2009/10/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/06 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)38876-5 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2008-12-196055 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2009 Dec 3;114(24):5034-43. doi: 10.1182/blood-2008-12-196055.

In this study, we sought to determine the clinical implications of RUNX1 mutations in 470 adult patients with de novo non-M3 AML. Sixty-three distinct RUNX1 mutations were identified in 62 persons (13.2%); 32 were in N-terminal and 31, C-terminal. The RUNX1 mutation was closely associated with male sex, older age, lower lactic dehydrogenase value, French-American-British M0/M1 subtypes, and expression of HLA-DR and CD34, but inversely correlated with CD33, CD15, CD19, and CD56 expression. Furthermore, the mutation was positively associated with MLL/PTD but negatively associated with CEBPA and NPM1 mutations. AML patients with RUNX1 mutations had a significantly lower complete remission rate and shorter disease-free and overall survival than those without the mutation. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that RUNX1 mutation was an independent poor prognostic factor for overall survival. Sequential analysis in 133 patients revealed that none acquired novel RUNX1 mutations during clinical courses. Our findings provide evidence that RUNX1 mutations are associated with distinct biologic and clinical characteristics and poor prognosis in patients with de novo AML.","['Tang, Jih-Luh', 'Hou, Hsin-An', 'Chen, Chien-Yuan', 'Liu, Chieh-Yu', 'Chou, Wen-Chien', 'Tseng, Mei-Hsuan', 'Huang, Chi-Fei', 'Lee, Fen-Yu', 'Liu, Ming-Chih', 'Yao, Ming', 'Huang, Shang-Yi', 'Ko, Bor-Sheng', 'Hsu, Szu-Chun', 'Wu, Shang-Ju', 'Tsay, Woei', 'Chen, Yao-Chang', 'Lin, Liang-In', 'Tien, Hwei-Fang']","['Tang JL', 'Hou HA', 'Chen CY', 'Liu CY', 'Chou WC', 'Tseng MH', 'Huang CF', 'Lee FY', 'Liu MC', 'Yao M', 'Huang SY', 'Ko BS', 'Hsu SC', 'Wu SJ', 'Tsay W', 'Chen YC', 'Lin LI', 'Tien HF']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091006,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,2009/10/08 06:00,2010/01/08 06:00,['2009/10/08 06:00'],"['2009/10/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/08 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)38797-8 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2009-05-223784 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2009 Dec 17;114(26):5352-61. doi: 10.1182/blood-2009-05-223784.

We report a 30-year-old woman with chronic myeloid leukemia who became pregnant twice successfully. Philadelphia-positive CML in its chronic phase was diagnosed at 16 weeks of her first gestation. At that time, she received no treatment throughout her pregnancy. At 38 weeks of gestation, a normal infant was delivered by cesarean section. At six weeks postpartum, the patient underwent imatinib mesylate therapy but she could not tolerate the treatment. The treatment was then changed to nilotinib at 400 mg orally b.i.d. Two years later, she became pregnant again while she was on nilotinib 200 mg b.i.d. The unplanned pregnancy was identified during her 7.4 weeks of gestation. Because the patient elected to continue her pregnancy, nilotinib was stopped immediately, and no further treatment was given until delivery. Neither obstetrical complications nor structural malformations in neonates in both pregnancies were observed. Both babies' growth and development have been normal.

Histone modification and DNA methylation can have different roles in gene silencing in cancer. To investigate whether histone modifications would contribute to the dysregulation of miRNAs in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), the effect of a histone deacetylase inhibitor, trichostatin A (TSA), on miRNA expression profile was analysed by microarray assay in a precursor B-cell ALL cell line NALM-6. A total of 10 miRNAs were downregulated and 31 were upregulated significantly following TSA treatment. Among TSA-upregulated miRNAs, MIR22 is an extronic miRNA and resides in the second exon of the non-coding transcript MGC14376. Upregulation of MIR22 transcription was found in both NALM-6 cells and primary human ALL malignant cells treated with TSA. Whereas a CpG island was identified within the promoter element of MIR22, no promoter DNA methylation was detected in these cells. In contrast, accumulation of the repressive histone marker H3K27 trimethylation (H3K27triM) was identified around the transcriptional start point of the gene, which was reduced by TSA treatment. Thus, accumulation of H3K27triM independent of promoter DNA methylation may be a novel epigenetic mechanism for MIR22 silencing in ALL.","['Li, Xiaoqing', 'Liu, Jun', 'Zhou, Rui', 'Huang, Shi', 'Huang, Shiang', 'Chen, Xian-Ming']","['Li X', 'Liu J', 'Zhou R', 'Huang S', 'Huang S', 'Chen XM']","['Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Wuhan, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091005,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,2009/10/08 06:00,2010/04/07 06:00,['2009/10/08 06:00'],"['2009/10/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/07 06:00 [medline]']","['BJH7920 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2009.07920.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2010 Jan;148(1):69-79. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2009.07920.x.

Unfortunately, evidence now exists to indicate that a portion of such patients treated with imatinib acquire resistance and subsequently relapse. To understand the heterogeneous basis of imatinib resistance, we have investigated the possible mechanism(s) via which hemin, a key regulator of hematopoiesis that is converted to heme intracellularly, renders CML cells less susceptible to imatinib. Hemin at 30-90 aM protected a substantial proportion (>40%) of human Bcr-Abl(+) CML cells (K-562 and KU-812) from imatinib-induced cell killing by increasing the imatinib IC50 value, reducing DNA damage, and promoting erythroid differentiation. RT-PCR assessment of RNA transcripts encoded by human GAPDH, Ggamma-globin, Bcr-Abl, HO-2, Hpr-6, CEBPa, Bcl-2a, Bcl-2b, and Nrf2 genes revealed that hemin selectively counteracted the repression of antiapoptotic Bcl-2a, Bcl-2b, and Nrf2 genes in imatinib-treated cells. These genes are markedly repressed by imatinib alone in human K-562 CML cells. Hemin, however, had no detectable effect on the expression of the Bcr-Abl gene. Moreover, inhibition of de novo heme biosynthesis by succinyl-acetone enhanced the killing effect of imatinib. These data clearly indicate that: (a) cellular heme resulted from de novo biosynthesis and hemin uptake alters the developmental stage of human Bcr-Abl(+) CML cells and their susceptibility to imatinib; (b) cellular heme counteracts the ability of imatinib to repress Bcl-2 and Nrf2 gene expression; and (c) inhibitors of de novo biosynthesis can be developed and combined with imatinib to enhance its antileukemic activity.","['Bonovolias, Ioannis D', 'Tsiftsoglou, Asterios S']","['Bonovolias ID', 'Tsiftsoglou AS']","['Laboratory of Pharmacology, Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki, Greece.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncol Res,Oncology research,9208097,,2009/10/08 06:00,2009/10/23 06:00,['2009/10/08 06:00'],"['2009/10/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3727/096504009789745557 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncol Res. 2009;17(11-12):535-47. doi: 10.3727/096504009789745557.,11-12,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Damage', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', '*Genes, bcl-2', 'Hemin/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'NF-E2-Related Factor 2/*genetics', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology']",,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (NF-E2-Related Factor 2)', '0 (NFE2L2 protein, human)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '743LRP9S7N (Hemin)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Over the past 7 years, we have used two salvage regimens: fludarabine, cytarabine, and idarubicin with (FLAG-IM) or without gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO) (9 mg/m(2) on Day 8) (FLAG-I) in relapsed/refractory AML. Three-quarters of patients also received concurrent G-CSF. Seventy-one patients were treated, 23 with FLAG-I and 48 with FLAG-IM. The median duration of follow-up was 30.6 months. The treatment groups were well balanced with median ages of 48 years (range 18-70) and 47 years (range 20-68), unfavorable cytogenetics in 57% and 35%, prior allogeneic stem cell transplant in 43% and 42%, and CR1 duration <1 year in 60% and 67%, respectively, for FLAG-I and FLAG-IM. The complete remission (CR) rate in the FLAG-I group was 39% with an additional 13% achieving a CRp [overall response rate (ORR) 52%]; the CR rate in the FLAG-IM group was 29% with an additional 27% achieving a CRp (ORR 56%). The median duration of response (DOR; 16.8 vs. 8.3 months), event-free survival (EFS; 7.4 vs. 4.1 months), and overall survival (OS; 8.8 vs. 5.0 months) trended to favor FLAG-I over FLAG-IM. The patients who received G-CSF concurrent with chemotherapy had superior overall response rate (ORR; 62% vs. 29%, P = 0.026), median EFS (6.2 vs. 3.4 months, P = 0.010), and OS (8.8 vs. 3.9 months, P = 0.004) when compared with those who sequentially received G-CSF and chemotherapy, regardless of chemotherapy regimen. The addition of GO, at this dose and schedule, to FLAG-I failed to improve the outcomes in patients with relapsed/refractory AML.

During follow-up for APL we identified 12 patients (9.8%) who developed CCA, not detected at diagnosis of APL and unrelated to their original APL karyotype. All patients had received all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and chemotherapy and were in complete remission for APL when secondary CCA were identified. The median latency period between diagnosis of APL and emergence of secondary CCA was 27.5 months (range: 2-54 months). To date, four patients with CCA have been diagnosed with therapy-related myelodysplastic syndrome (t-MDS)/acute myeloid leukemia (t-AML), giving a median t-MDS/AML free survival of 78 months, with follow-up ranging between 20 and 136 months from APL diagnosis. Three patients have died: two patients died of t-AML and another developed relapsed APL with persistence of his secondary clone but no diagnosis of t-MDS/AML and died from transplant-related complications. Two patients are alive with t-MDS. Seven patients with CCA are alive with no morphological evidence of MDS at the time of their last known follow-up; thus median survival has not been reached. The appearance of these abnormalities in the absence of morphological evidence of MDS in the majority of patients is unusual, and highlights the importance of continued cytogenetic follow-up in these patients.

Human BCSCs are considered to be derived from basal cells that reside in the basal membranes of alveolar units in human adult mammary glands. Furthermore, BCSCs have been shown to express higher levels of oxidative stress-responsive genes, which could confer part of their ability to resist anti-cancer therapy, than non-CSCs. The emerging picture of the biological properties of BCSCs would contribute for devising innovative therapies for breast cancer, targeting the intrinsic and extrinsic factors that maintain the BCSCs.","['Kai, Kazuharu', 'Arima, Yoshimi', 'Kamiya, Toshio', 'Saya, Hideyuki']","['Kai K', 'Arima Y', 'Kamiya T', 'Saya H']","['Division of Gene Regulation, Institute for Advanced Medical Research, Keio University School of Medicine, Keio University, 35 Shinano-machi, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo 160-8582, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20091006,Japan,Breast Cancer,"Breast cancer (Tokyo, Japan)",100888201,,2009/10/07 06:00,2010/07/16 06:00,['2009/10/07 06:00'],"['2009/06/28 00:00 [received]', '2009/08/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/10/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12282-009-0176-y [doi]'],ppublish,Breast Cancer. 2010 Apr;17(2):80-5. doi: 10.1007/s12282-009-0176-y.

This finding has not been replicated outside Britain. Here, we present a thorough analysis of the HFE gene in a panel of HLA homozygous reference cell lines and in the original population sample from South Wales (117 childhood ALL cases and 414 newborn controls). The 21 of 24 variants analyzed were from the HFE gene region extending 52 kb from the histone gene HIST1H1C to HIST1H1T. We identified the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs807212 as a tagging SNP for the most common HFE region haplotype, which contains wild-type alleles of all HFE variants examined. This intergenic SNP rs807212 yielded a strong male-specific protective association (per allele OR = 0.38, 95% CI = 0.22-0.64, P (trend) = 0.0002; P = 0.48 in females), which accounted for the original C282Y risk association. In the HapMap project data, rs807212 was in strong linkage disequilibrium with 25 other SNPs spanning 151 kb around HFE. Minor alleles of these 26 SNPs characterized the most common haplotype for the HFE region, which lacked all disease-associated HFE variants. The HapMap data suggested positive selection in this region even in populations where the HFE C282Y mutation is absent. These results have implications for the sex-specific associations observed in this region and suggest the inclusion of rs807212 in future studies of the HFE gene and the extended HLA class I region.","['Davis, Charronne F', 'Dorak, M Tevfik']","['Davis CF', 'Dorak MT']","['Genomic Immunoepidemiology Laboratory, HUMIGEN LLC, The Institute for Genetic Immunology, 2439 Kuser Road, Hamilton, NJ, 08690-3303, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091006,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,,2009/10/07 06:00,2010/03/10 06:00,['2009/10/07 06:00'],"['2009/08/10 00:00 [received]', '2009/09/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/10/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00277-009-0839-y [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2010 Apr;89(4):375-84. doi: 10.1007/s00277-009-0839-y.

PATIENTS: The study included five groups (A, B, C, D, and E) of children with ALL undergoing intensive chemotherapy. Groups A and B consisted of neutropenic children with bacterial and viral infection, respectively. Groups C and D consisted of nonneutropenic children with bacterial and viral infection, respectively. Group E consisted of children without neutropenia and without fever. METHODS: In all groups, blood samples were collected upon admission and then for 7 days on a daily basis. Levels of CRP, PCT, TNF-a, IL-1b, IL-8, and sTNFRII were determined in all blood samples. RESULTS: We found a highly significant difference in PCT levels between bacterial and nonbacterial episodes. Sensitivity and specificity of PCT were 94 and 96.5%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Serial measurement of PCT levels on a daily basis seems to be helpful for early prediction of severe bacterial infections, monitoring febrile episodes regarding response to antibiotic therapy, and early detection of complications in the infectious process.","['Hatzistilianou, Maria', 'Rekliti, Aleka', 'Athanassiadou, Fanni', 'Catriu, Dorothea']","['Hatzistilianou M', 'Rekliti A', 'Athanassiadou F', 'Catriu D']","['2nd Department of Paediatrics, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Agiou Ioannou 23, Kalamaria, 551 32, Thessaloniki, Greece. nontas@topo.auth.gr']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20091006,Switzerland,Inflamm Res,Inflammation research : official journal of the European Histamine Research Society ...

Myeloid neoplasms are now classified into five categories: acute myeloid leukemia, myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN), MDS/MPN, and myeloid and/or lymphoid malignancies associated with eosinophilia and PDGFR or FGFR1 rearrangements. MPN are subclassified into eight separate entities: chronic myelogenous leukemia, polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia, primary myelofibrosis, systemic mastocytosis, chronic eosinophilic leukemia not otherwise specified, chronic neutrophilic leukemia, and unclassifiable MPN. The diagnosis of chronic myelogenous leukemia requires the presence of BCR-ABL1, while its absence is required for all other MPN. Additional MPN-associated molecular markers include mutations of JAK2, MPL, TET2 and KIT. JAK2 V617F is found in most patients with polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia, or primary myelofibrosis and is, therefore, useful as a clonal marker in those settings. The diagnostic utility of MPL and TET2 mutations is limited by low mutational frequency. In systemic mastocytosis, presence of KIT D816V is expected but not essential for diagnosis. Chronic eosinophilic leukemia not otherwise specified should be distinguished from both PDGFR-rearranged or FGFR1-rearranged neoplasms and hypereosinophilic syndrome. We discuss histologic, cytogenetic and molecular changes in MPN and illustrate their integration into practical diagnostic algorithms.","['Tefferi, Ayalew', 'Skoda, Radek', 'Vardiman, James W']","['Tefferi A', 'Skoda R', 'Vardiman JW']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, 200 First Street SW, Rochester, MN 55905, USA. tefferi.ayalew@mayo.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20091006,England,Nat Rev Clin Oncol,Nature reviews.

Availability of measurement of minimal residual disease (MRD) at an early time point with a reduced-cost method is of clinical relevance. In the AIEOP-BFM-ALL (Associazione Italiana Ematologia Oncologia Pediatrica and Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster Study Group) 2000 trial, patients were stratified by levels of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) MRD at day +33 and +78. AIEOP studied the prognostic impact of MRD measured by flow cytometry (FCM) at day 15 of induction therapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Bone marrow samples from 830 Italian patients were collected on day 15, after 14 days of steroids, and one dose of intrathecal methotrexate, vincristine, daunorubicine, and asparaginase. Cells were analyzed by four-color FCM for detection of leukemia-associated immunophenotypes. RESULTS: Three patient risk groups were identified by FCM: standard (< 0.1% blast cells; 42% of the total), intermediate (0.1 to < 10%; 47%), and high (> or = 10%; 11%). Their 5-year cumulative incidences of relapse were 7.5% (SE, 1.5), 17.5% (SE, 2.1), and 47.2% (SE, 5.9), respectively. In multivariate analysis, FCM was the most important prognostic factor among those available by day 15, with two-fold and five-fold increase in the risk of relapse compared with patients with less than 0.1%. PCR MRD, when added to the model, had significant prognostic impact; yet high levels of FCM MRD retained an independent ability to detect a significantly higher risk of relapse. CONCLUSION: Measurement of FCM MRD in day 15 bone marrow was the most powerful early predictor of relapse, applicable to virtually all patients; it may complement PCR MRD-based stratification including later time points, thus allowing additional treatment tailoring.","['Basso, Giuseppe', 'Veltroni, Marinella', 'Valsecchi, Maria Grazia', 'Dworzak, Michael N', 'Ratei, Richard', 'Silvestri, Daniela', 'Benetello, Alessandra', 'Buldini, Barbara', 'Maglia, Oscar', 'Masera, Giuseppe', 'Conter, Valentino', 'Arico, Maurizio', 'Biondi, Andrea', 'Gaipa, Giuseppe']","['Basso G', 'Veltroni M', 'Valsecchi MG', 'Dworzak MN', 'Ratei R', 'Silvestri D', 'Benetello A', 'Buldini B', 'Maglia O', 'Masera G', 'Conter V', 'Arico M', 'Biondi A', 'Gaipa G']","['Laboratorio di Oncoematologia Pediatrica, Department of Pediatrics, University, Padova, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091005,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,2009/10/07 06:00,2009/11/18 06:00,['2009/10/07 06:00'],"['2009/10/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/11/18 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2008.20.8934 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2008.20.8934 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2009 Nov 1;27(31):5168-74. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2008.20.8934.

We examined outcome for young adults with ALL enrolled onto the Children's Cancer Group (CCG) 1961 study between 1996 and 2002. PATIENTS AND METHODS: CCG 1961 entered patients with ALL 1 to 21 years of age with initial WBC count > or = 50,000/microL and/or age > or = 10 years. Randomly assigned therapies evaluated the impact of postinduction treatment intensification on outcome. We examined outcome and prognostic factors for 262 young adults with ALL. RESULTS: Five-year event-free and overall survival rates for young adult patients are 71.5% (SE, 3.6%) and 77.5% (SE, 3.3%), respectively. Rapid responder patients (< 25% bone marrow blasts on day 7) randomly assigned to augmented therapy had 5-year event-free survival of 81.8% (SE, 7%), as compared with 66.8% (SE, 6.7%) for patients receiving standard therapy (P = .07). One versus two interim maintenance and delayed intensification courses had no significant impact on event-free survival. WBC count more than 50,000/microL was an adverse prognostic factor. CONCLUSION: Young adult patients with ALL showing a rapid response to induction chemotherapy benefit from early intensive postinduction therapy but do not benefit from a second interim maintenance and delayed intensification phase. Given the excellent outcome with this chemotherapy, there seems to be no role for the routine use of allogeneic stem-cell transplantation in first remission for young adults with ALL.","['Nachman, James B', 'La, Mei K', 'Hunger, Stephen P', 'Heerema, Nyla A', 'Gaynon, Paul S', 'Hastings, Caroline', 'Mattano, Leonard A Jr', 'Sather, Harland', 'Devidas, Meenakshi', 'Freyer, David R', 'Steinherz, Peter G', 'Seibel, Nita L']","['Nachman JB', 'La MK', 'Hunger SP', 'Heerema NA', 'Gaynon PS', 'Hastings C', 'Mattano LA Jr', 'Sather H', 'Devidas M', 'Freyer DR', 'Steinherz PG', 'Seibel NL']","[""University of Chicago Children's Hospital, MC 4060, Chicago, IL 60637, USA. jnachman@peds.bsd.uchicago.edu""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091005,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,PMC3053149,2009/10/07 06:00,2009/11/18 06:00,['2009/10/07 06:00'],"['2009/10/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/11/18 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2008.20.8959 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2008.20.8959 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2009 Nov 1;27(31):5189-94. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2008.20.8959.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We evaluated whether imatinib (340 mg/m(2)/d) with an intensive chemotherapy regimen improved outcome in children ages 1 to 21 years with Ph+ ALL (N = 92) and compared toxicities to Ph- ALL patients (N = 65) given the same chemotherapy without imatinib. Exposure to imatinib was increased progressively in five patient cohorts that received imatinib from 42 (cohort 1; n = 7) to 280 continuous days (cohort 5; n = 50) before maintenance therapy. Patients with human leukocyte antigen (HLA) -identical sibling donors underwent blood and marrow transplantation (BMT) with imatinib given for 6 months following BMT. RESULTS: Continuous imatinib exposure improved outcome in cohort 5 patients with a 3-year event-free survival (EFS) of 80% +/- 11% (95% CI, 64% to 90%), more than twice historical controls (35% +/- 4%; P < .0001). Three-year EFS was similar for patients in cohort 5 treated with chemotherapy plus imatinib (88% +/- 11%; 95% CI, 66% to 96%) or sibling donor BMT (57% +/- 22%; 95% CI, 30.4% to 76.1%). There were no significant toxicities associated with adding imatinib to intensive chemotherapy. The higher imatinib dosing in cohort 5 appears to improve survival by having an impact on the outcome of children with a higher burden of minimal residual disease after induction. CONCLUSION: Imatinib plus intensive chemotherapy improved 3-year EFS in children and adolescents with Ph+ ALL, with no appreciable increase in toxicity. BMT plus imatinib offered no advantage over BMT alone. Additional follow-up is required to determine the impact of this treatment on long-term EFS and determine whether chemotherapy plus imatinib can replace BMT.","['Schultz, Kirk R', 'Bowman, W Paul', 'Aledo, Alexander', 'Slayton, William B', 'Sather, Harland', 'Devidas, Meenakshi', 'Wang, Chenguang', 'Davies, Stella M', 'Gaynon, Paul S', 'Trigg, Michael', 'Rutledge, Robert', 'Burden, Laura', 'Jorstad, Dean', 'Carroll, Andrew', 'Heerema, Nyla A', 'Winick, Naomi', 'Borowitz, Michael J', 'Hunger, Stephen P', 'Carroll, William L', 'Camitta, Bruce']","['Schultz KR', 'Bowman WP', 'Aledo A', 'Slayton WB', 'Sather H', 'Devidas M', 'Wang C', 'Davies SM', 'Gaynon PS', 'Trigg M', 'Rutledge R', 'Burden L', 'Jorstad D', 'Carroll A', 'Heerema NA', 'Winick N', 'Borowitz MJ', 'Hunger SP', 'Carroll WL', 'Camitta B']","[""Department of Pediatrics, Division of Hematology/Oncology/Bone Marrow Transplantation, University of British Columbia, B.C.'s Children's Hospital, Vancouver, BC, V6H 3V4, Canada. kschultz@interchange.ubc.ca""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091005,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,PMC2773475,2009/10/07 06:00,2009/11/18 06:00,['2009/10/07 06:00'],"['2009/10/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/11/18 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2008.21.2514 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2008.21.2514 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2009 Nov 1;27(31):5175-81. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2008.21.2514.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We treated 24 patients with a variety of T-cell leukemias and lymphomas with a combination of alemtuzumab 30 mg intravenously (IV) three times weekly for up to 3 months and pentostatin 4 mg/m(2) IV weekly for 4 weeks followed by alternate weekly administration for up to 6 months. Prophylactic antibiotics including antiviral, antifungal, and antibacterial agents were administered during the treatment and for 2 months after its completion. RESULTS: The median age of patients was 57 years (range, 21 to 79 years). Eight patients were previously untreated, and 16 had a median of two prior therapies (range, one to six regimens). Thirteen patients responded to treatment (11 complete responses [CRs] and two partial responses), for an overall response rate of 54%. The median response duration was 19.5 months. Monoclonal T-cell receptor chain gene rearrangements were detected by polymerase chain reaction in bone marrow of 20 of 22 evaluable patients and became negative in five of seven evaluable patients in CR. Opportunistic infections caused by pathogens associated with severe T-cell dysfunction were common. CONCLUSION: The combination of alemtuzumab and pentostatin is feasible and effective in T-cell neoplasms.

We have previously identified a serine residue (Ser585) in the betac subunit of the granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor that selectively and independently promotes cell survival. We now show that Ser585 phosphorylation is constitutive in 20 (87%) of 23 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patient samples, indicating that this survival-only pathway is frequently deregulated in leukemia. We performed a global expression screen to identify gene targets of this survival pathway and report a 138-gene betac Ser585-regulated transcriptome. Pathway analysis defines a gene network enriched for PI3-kinase target genes and a cluster of genes involved in cancer and cell survival. We show that one such gene, osteopontin (OPN), is a functionally relevant target of the Ser585-survival pathway as shown by siRNA-mediated knockdown of OPN expression that induces cell death in both AML blasts and CD34(+)CD38(-)CD123(+) leukemic progenitors. Increased expression of OPN at diagnosis is associated with poor prognosis with multivariate analysis indicating that it is an independent predictor of overall patient survival in normal karyotype AML (n = 60; HR = 2.2; P = .01). These results delineate a novel cytokine-regulated Ser585/PI3-kinase signaling network that is deregulated in AML and identify OPN as a potential prognostic and therapeutic target.","['Powell, Jason A', 'Thomas, Daniel', 'Barry, Emma F', 'Kok, Chung H', 'McClure, Barbara J', 'Tsykin, Anna', 'To, L Bik', 'Brown, Anna', 'Lewis, Ian D', 'Herbert, Kirsten', 'Goodall, Gregory J', 'Speed, Terence P', 'Asou, Norio', 'Jacob, Bindya', 'Osato, Motomi', 'Haylock, David N', 'Nilsson, Susan K', ""D'Andrea, Richard J"", 'Lopez, Angel F', 'Guthridge, Mark A']","['Powell JA', 'Thomas D', 'Barry EF', 'Kok CH', 'McClure BJ', 'Tsykin A', 'To LB', 'Brown A', 'Lewis ID', 'Herbert K', 'Goodall GJ', 'Speed TP', 'Asou N', 'Jacob B', 'Osato M', 'Haylock DN', 'Nilsson SK', ""D'Andrea RJ"", 'Lopez AF', 'Guthridge MA']","['Cell Growth and Differentiation Laboratory, Division of Human Immunology, Centre for Cancer Biology, SA Pathology, Frome Road, Adelaide, SA 5000, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091005,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,2009/10/07 06:00,2010/01/13 06:00,['2009/10/07 06:00'],"['2009/10/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/13 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)38900-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2009-02-204818 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2009 Nov 26;114(23):4859-70. doi: 10.1182/blood-2009-02-204818.

The histone deactetylase (HDAC) inhibitor suberoyl bis-hydroxamic acid (SBHA) was employed to determine whether and by what mechanism ABT-737 might interact with agents that upregulate Bim. Expression profiling of BH3-only proteins indicated that SBHA increased Bim, Puma, and Noxa expression, while SBHA concentrations that upregulated Bim significantly potentiated ABT-737 lethality. Concordance between SBHA-mediated Bim upregulation and interactions with ABT-737 was observed in various human leukemia and myeloma cells. SBHA-induced Bim was largely sequestered by Bcl-2 and Bcl-x(L), rather than Mcl-1; ABT-737 attenuated these interactions, thereby triggering Bak/Bax activation and mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization. Knockdown of Bim (but not Puma or Noxa) by shRNA or ectopic overexpression of Bcl-2, Bcl-x(L), or Mcl-1 diminished Bax/Bak activation and apoptosis. Notably, ectopic expression of these antiapoptotic proteins disabled death signaling by sequestering different proapoptotic proteins, i.e., Bim by Bcl-2, both Bim and Bak by Bcl-x(L), and Bak by Mcl-1. Together, these findings indicate that HDAC inhibitor-inducible Bim is primarily neutralized by Bcl-2 and Bcl-x(L), thus providing a mechanistic framework by which Bcl-2 antagonists potentiate the lethality of agents, such as HDAC inhibitors, which upregulate Bim.","['Chen, Shuang', 'Dai, Yun', 'Pei, Xin-Yan', 'Grant, Steven']","['Chen S', 'Dai Y', 'Pei XY', 'Grant S']","['Department of Medicine, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA 23298, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091005,United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,PMC2786688,2009/10/07 06:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/10/07 06:00'],"['2009/10/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['MCB.01481-08 [pii]', '10.1128/MCB.01481-08 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2009 Dec;29(23):6149-69. doi: 10.1128/MCB.01481-08.

Indeed, recent studies showed that phosphoinositide-phospholipase (PI-PL)Cbeta1 mono-allelic deletion correlates with a higher risk of AML evolution. Also, a single patient treated with azacitidine, a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor currently used in MDS, displayed a direct correlation between PI-PLCbeta1 gene expression and drug responsiveness. Consequently, we hypothesized that PI-PLCbeta1 could be a target for demethylating therapy. First, we analyzed the structure of PI-PLCbeta1 gene promoter, then quantified the degree of PI-PLCbeta1 promoter methylation and gene expression in MDS patients at baseline and during azacitidine administration. Indeed, PI-PLCbeta1 mRNA increased in responder patients, along with a reduction of PI-PLCbeta1 promoter methylation. Also, the molecular response correlated to and anticipated the clinical outcome, thus suggesting that PI-PLCbeta1 gene reactivation could predict azacitidine responsiveness. Our results demonstrate not only that PI-PLCbeta1 promoter is hypermethylated in high-risk MDS patients, but also that the amount of PI-PLCbeta1 mRNA could predict the clinical response to azacitidine, therefore indicating a promising new therapeutic approach.","['Follo, Matilde Y', 'Finelli, Carlo', 'Mongiorgi, Sara', 'Clissa, Cristina', 'Bosi, Costanza', 'Testoni, Nicoletta', 'Chiarini, Francesca', 'Ramazzotti, Giulia', 'Baccarani, Michele', 'Martelli, Alberto M', 'Manzoli, Lucia', 'Martinelli, Giovanni', 'Cocco, Lucio']","['Follo MY', 'Finelli C', 'Mongiorgi S', 'Clissa C', 'Bosi C', 'Testoni N', 'Chiarini F', 'Ramazzotti G', 'Baccarani M', 'Martelli AM', 'Manzoli L', 'Martinelli G', 'Cocco L']","['Cellular Signalling Laboratory, Department of Human Anatomical Sciences, University of Bologna, Via Irnerio 48, Bologna, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090910,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,PMC2741479,2009/10/07 06:00,2009/12/29 06:00,['2009/10/07 06:00'],"['2009/10/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/29 06:00 [medline]']","['0907109106 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.0907109106 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2009 Sep 29;106(39):16811-6. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0907109106.

While gammaretroviruses have well-characterized oncogenic effects in animals, they have not been shown to cause human cancers. We provide experimental evidence that XMRV is indeed a gammaretrovirus with protein composition and particle ultrastructure highly similar to Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMLV), another gammaretrovirus. We analyzed 334 consecutive prostate resection specimens, using a quantitative PCR assay and immunohistochemistry (IHC) with an anti-XMRV specific antiserum. We found XMRV DNA in 6% and XMRV protein expression in 23% of prostate cancers. XMRV proteins were expressed primarily in malignant epithelial cells, suggesting that retroviral infection may be directly linked to tumorigenesis. XMRV infection was associated with prostate cancer, especially higher-grade cancers. We found XMRV infection to be independent of a common polymorphism in the RNASEL gene, unlike results previously reported. This finding increases the population at risk for XMRV infection from only those homozygous for the RNASEL variant to all individuals.

The biochemistry of Mfrn1-mediated iron transport into the mitochondria, however, is poorly understood. Here, we used the strategy of in vivo epitope-tagging affinity purification and mass spectrometry to investigate Mfrn1-mediated mitochondrial iron homeostasis. Abcb10, a mitochondrial inner membrane ATP-binding cassette transporter highly induced during erythroid maturation in hematopoietic tissues, was found as one key protein that physically interacts with Mfrn1 during mouse erythroleukemia (MEL) cell differentiation. Mfrn1 was shown previously to have a longer protein half-life in differentiated MEL cells compared with undifferentiated cells. In this study, Abcb10 was found to enhance the stabilization of Mfrn1 protein in MEL cells and transfected heterologous COS7 cells. In undifferentiated MEL cells, cotransfected Abcb10 specifically interacts with Mfrn1 to enhance its protein stability and promote Mfrn1-dependent mitochondrial iron importation. The structural stabilization of the Mfrn1-Abcb10 complex demonstrates a previously uncharacterized function for Abcb10 in mitochondria. Furthermore, the binding domain of Mfrn1-Abcb10 interaction maps to the N terminus of Mfrn1. These results suggest the tight regulation of mitochondrial iron acquisition and heme synthesis in erythroblasts is mediated by both transcriptional and posttranslational mechanisms, whereby the high level of Mfrn1 is stabilized by oligomeric protein complexes.","['Chen, Wen', 'Paradkar, Prasad N', 'Li, Liangtao', 'Pierce, Eric L', 'Langer, Nathaniel B', 'Takahashi-Makise, Naoko', 'Hyde, Brigham B', 'Shirihai, Orian S', 'Ward, Diane M', 'Kaplan, Jerry', 'Paw, Barry H']","['Chen W', 'Paradkar PN', 'Li L', 'Pierce EL', 'Langer NB', 'Takahashi-Makise N', 'Hyde BB', 'Shirihai OS', 'Ward DM', 'Kaplan J', 'Paw BH']","[""Department of Medicine, Hematology Division, Brigham and Women's Hospital, and Hematology-Oncology Division, Children's Hospital Boston, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090904,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,PMC2752562,2009/10/07 06:00,2009/11/07 06:00,['2009/10/07 06:00'],"['2009/10/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/11/07 06:00 [medline]']","['0904519106 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.0904519106 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2009 Sep 22;106(38):16263-8. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0904519106.

Here we identify a bona fide age-dependent PD-1(+) memory phenotype (MP) CD4(+) T cell subpopulation that hardly proliferates in response to T cell receptor (TCR) stimulation and produces abundant osteopontin at the cost of typical T cell lymphokines. These T cells demonstrate impaired repopulation in Rag2(-/-) mice, but a homeostatic proliferation in gamma-ray-irradiated mice. These T cells also reveal a unique molecular signature, including a strong expression of C/EBPalpha normally expressed in myeloid-lineage cells, with diminished c-Myc and cyclin D1. Transduction of Cebpa in regular CD4(+) T cells inhibited the TCR-mediated proliferation with c-Myc and cyclin D1 repression and caused a striking activation of Spp1 encoding osteopontin along with concomitant repression of T cell lymphokine genes. Although these T cells gradually increase in number with age and become predominant at the senescent stage in normal mice, the generation is robustly accelerated during leukemia. In both conditions, their predominance is associated with the diminution of specific CD4(+) T cell response. The results suggest that global T cell immunodepression in senescence and leukemia is attributable to the increase in PD-1(+) MP CD4(+) T cells expressing C/EBPalpha.","['Shimatani, Kenichiro', 'Nakashima, Yasuhiro', 'Hattori, Masakazu', 'Hamazaki, Yoko', 'Minato, Nagahiro']","['Shimatani K', 'Nakashima Y', 'Hattori M', 'Hamazaki Y', 'Minato N']","['Department of Immunology and Cell Biology, Graduate School of Biostudies, Kyoto University, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto 606-8501, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090908,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,PMC2739871,2009/10/07 06:00,2009/11/17 06:00,['2009/10/07 06:00'],"['2009/10/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/11/17 06:00 [medline]']","['0908805106 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.0908805106 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2009 Sep 15;106(37):15807-12. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0908805106.

We found that the accumulation of all of the major transmembrane and all skeletal proteins of the mature red blood cell, except actin, accrued progressively during terminal erythroid differentiation. At the same time, and in marked contrast, accumulation of various adhesion molecules decreased. In particular, the adhesion molecule, CD44 exhibited a progressive and dramatic decrease from proerythroblast to reticulocyte; this enabled us to devise a new strategy for distinguishing unambiguously between erythroblasts at successive developmental stages.

In this research we aimed to investigate FTIR's utility for identifying and characterizing different modes of cell death, using leukemic cell lines as a model system. CCRF-CEM and U937 leukemia cells were treated with arabinoside and doxorubicin apoptosis inducers, as well as with potassium cyanide, saponin, freezing-thawing, and H(2)O(2) necrosis inducers. Cell death mode was determined by various gold standard biochemical methods in parallel with FTIR-microscope measurements. Both cell death modes exhibit large spectral changes in lipid absorbance during apoptosis and necrosis; however, these changes are similar and thus cannot be used to distinguish apoptosis from necrosis. In contrast to the above confounding factor, our results reveal that apoptosis and necrosis can still be distinguished by the degree of DNA opaqueness to infrared light. Moreover, these two cell death modes also can be differentiated by their infrared absorbance, which relates to the secondary structure of total cellular protein. In light of these findings, we conclude that, because of its capacity to monitor multiple biomolecular parameters, FTIR spectroscopy enables unambiguous and easy analysis of cell death modes and may be useful for biochemical and medical applications.","['Zelig, Udi', 'Kapelushnik, Joseph', 'Moreh, Raymond', 'Mordechai, Shaul', 'Nathan, Ilana']","['Zelig U', 'Kapelushnik J', 'Moreh R', 'Mordechai S', 'Nathan I']","['Department of Biomedical Engineering, Ben Gurion University, Beer Sheva, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Biophys J,Biophysical journal,0370626,PMC2756387,2009/10/07 06:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/10/07 06:00'],"['2009/05/27 00:00 [received]', '2009/07/16 00:00 [revised]', '2009/07/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/10/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-3495(09)01289-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bpj.2009.07.026 [doi]']",ppublish,Biophys J. 2009 Oct 7;97(7):2107-14. doi: 10.1016/j.bpj.2009.07.026.,7,IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', '*Necrosis', 'Spectrophotometry, Infrared', 'Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared']",,,,,['Chief Scientist Office/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Approximately 10% of individuals with CLL report a family history of CLL or a related lymphoproliferative disorder, and genetic predisposition is the best understood risk factor for CLL. Studies of familial CLL have suggested that the disease features are largely similar to sporadic CLL, although recent data suggest that familial CLL may more commonly show somatic hypermutation of the immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable region, suggesting a more indolent disease course. Monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (MBL) has been identified recently as a likely precursor to CLL; it is found in the general population with increasing age and enriched in unaffected relatives of individuals with familial CLL. Studies of MBL as well as mouse models of CLL may lead to better understanding of early CLL pathogenesis that is relevant to familial predisposition. To date, the identification of genes that predispose to familial CLL has been slow, primarily due to the relatively few families available for study, the small size of those families and disease causation most likely by multiple genes that each confer smaller risks. In the coming years, the application of systematic genomics approaches to familial CLL should, hopefully, lead to the identification of novel loci involved in the disease.","['Brown, Jennifer R']",['Brown JR'],"['Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA. jbrown@partners.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,England,Expert Rev Hematol,Expert review of hematology,101485942,PMC2732130,2009/10/06 06:00,2011/04/13 06:00,['2009/10/06 06:00'],"['2009/10/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/04/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1586/17474086.1.1.51 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Rev Hematol. 2008 Oct;1(1):51-61. doi: 10.1586/17474086.1.1.51.,1,IM,"['Animals', 'Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/genetics', 'Risk Factors', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics']",,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (ATM protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Atm protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",,,"['K23 CA115682-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K23 CA115682-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K23 CA115682/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K23 CA115682-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K23 CA115682-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,['NIHMS71775'],,['NOTNLM'],"['association', 'familial chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'linkage', 'lymphocytosis', 'monoclonal B cell']",,,,,,,

The function and the phenotype of donor-derived NK cells obtained from 35 allografted patients 30 and 60 days after HSCT for AML or other-than-AML hematological malignancies has been assessed. NK functional status was investigated by measuring the degranulation capacity (externalization of CD107a) of NK cells against human K562. We also concomitantly determined the concentration of selected cytokines known to modulate NK function and/or receptor expression. At day 30, donor-derived AML and non-AML NK cells could efficiently degranulate when exposed to leukemic K562 targets. At day 60, we observed a reduced NK degranulation potential in AML patients only. Decreased NK activity in AML patients was concomitant to NKp46 and NKp30 down-regulation. AML NK cells were chronically exposed to low IL-2 levels following HSCT. TGF-beta(1) was undetectable in all patients. In AML, the functional activity of donor-derived NK cells is remarkable at day 30 but may strongly decrease two months after HSCT.

Approximately 2000 children with malignant diseases (about 75 % with acute leukemias) have been transplanted with a related (n=199) or unrelated CBT (UCBT, n=1663) and reported to Eurocord registry from 1990-2008. Disease-specific studies have been carried out after UCBT for acute lymphoblastic and myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes in others to identify the risk factors that may improve outcomes. Outcomes after CBT have been compared with other alternative allogeneic hematopoietic SCT (HSCT) donors. Briefly, after CBT, myeloid engraftment is delayed, acute and chronic GVHD decreased and disease-free survival was not statistically different when compared with HLA identical and other alternative HSCT donor. Therefore, any physician has to carefully evaluate, for each single pediatric patient in need of an allograft, all the possible alternatives in order to choose the best hematopoietic stem cell donor, taking into account type of disease, urgency of transplantation, donor characteristics and center experience.

Although PBSC transplantation led to a faster hematological recovery than BM transplantation, in univariate analysis the stem cell source, cytogenetics and different BU formulations did not significantly affect OS and DFS, whereas age and the number of post-remission chemotherapy cycles did have a significant effect on the clinical outcome. Multivariate analysis identified age <55 years as the only important independent predictor for OS and DFS. Our data suggest that BU/Mel, being associated with a low toxicity profile (mainly mucositis) and mortality, is an effective conditioning regimen even for high-risk AML patients in first CR undergoing auto-SCT.","['Lemoli, R M', ""D'Addio, A"", 'Marotta, G', 'Pezzullo, L', 'Zuffa, E', 'Montanari, M', 'De Vivo, A', 'Bonini, A', 'Galieni, P', 'Carella, A M', 'Guidi, S', 'Michieli, M', 'Olivieri, A', 'Bosi, A']","['Lemoli RM', ""D'Addio A"", 'Marotta G', 'Pezzullo L', 'Zuffa E', 'Montanari M', 'De Vivo A', 'Bonini A', 'Galieni P', 'Carella AM', 'Guidi S', 'Michieli M', 'Olivieri A', 'Bosi A']","['Institute of Hematology L & A Seragnoli, University of Bologna and Stem Cell Research Center, SOrsola-Malpighi Hospital, Bologna, Italy. roberto.lemoli@unibo.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091005,England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,,2009/10/06 06:00,2010/08/06 06:00,['2009/10/06 06:00'],"['2009/10/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/06 06:00 [medline]']","['bmt2009235 [pii]', '10.1038/bmt.2009.235 [doi]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2010 Apr;45(4):640-6. doi: 10.1038/bmt.2009.235.

METHODS: Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) technology-based assay and enzymatic inhibition assay were used to screen Plk1 inhibitors. Sulphorhodamine B (SRB)-based assay, flow cytometry, confocal microscopy and Western blotting were used to further identify the potent Plk1 inhibitor. To investigate the inhibitory mechanism of the active compound against Plk1, enzymatic inhibition assay, SPR and yeast two-hybrid technology-based assays were used. RESULTS: Aristolactam AIIIa was identified as a new type of Plk1 inhibitors, targeting the Polo Box domain (PBD) which is another efficient tactic for exploring Plk1 inhibitors. Further studies indicated that it could block the proliferations of HeLa, A549, HGC and the HCT-8/V cells (clinical Navelbine-resistant cancer cell), induce mitotic arrest of HeLa cells at G2/M phase with spindle abnormalities and promote apoptosis in HeLa cells. The results from SPR and yeast two-hybrid technology-based assays suggested that it could target both the catalytic domain of Plk1 (CD) and PBD and enhance the CD/PBD interaction. CONCLUSION: Our current work is expected to shed light on the potential anti-tumor mechanism of Aristolactam AIIIa, and this natural product might be possibly used as a lead compound for further developing anti-tumor drugs.","['Li, Li', 'Wang, Xu', 'Chen, Jing', 'Ding, Hong', 'Zhang, Yu', 'Hu, Tian-Cen', 'Hu, Li-Hong', 'Jiang, Hua-Liang', 'Shen, Xu']","['Li L', 'Wang X', 'Chen J', 'Ding H', 'Zhang Y', 'Hu TC', 'Hu LH', 'Jiang HL', 'Shen X']","['School of Pharmacy, East China University of Science and Technology, Shanghai 200237, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Acta Pharmacol Sin,Acta pharmacologica Sinica,100956087,PMC4007328,2009/10/06 06:00,2010/01/29 06:00,['2009/10/06 06:00'],"['2009/10/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/29 06:00 [medline]']","['aps2009141 [pii]', '10.1038/aps.2009.141 [doi]']",ppublish,Acta Pharmacol Sin. 2009 Oct;30(10):1443-53. doi: 10.1038/aps.2009.141.,10,IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/drug therapy/enzymology', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Catalytic Domain/genetics', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Colonic Neoplasms/drug therapy/enzymology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'HT29 Cells', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Indole Alkaloids', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Lactams', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy/enzymology', 'Ligands', 'Lung Neoplasms/drug therapy/enzymology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Structure', 'Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Spindle Apparatus/drug effects', 'Stomach Neoplasms/drug therapy/enzymology', 'Surface Plasmon Resonance', 'Two-Hybrid System Techniques']",,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Aristolactam AIIIa)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Indole Alkaloids)', '0 (Lactams)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (polo-like kinase 1)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, whether these changes are the cause or consequence of stem cell fate remains unknown. Here, we show that alternative functional programs of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are governed by gradual differences in methylation levels. Constitutive methylation is essential for HSC self-renewal but dispensable for homing, cell cycle control and suppression of apoptosis. Notably, HSCs from mice with reduced DNA methyltransferase 1 activity cannot suppress key myeloerythroid regulators and thus can differentiate into myeloerythroid, but not lymphoid, progeny. A similar methylation dosage effect controls stem cell function in leukemia. These data identify DNA methylation as an essential epigenetic mechanism to protect stem cells from premature activation of predominant differentiation programs and suggest that methylation dynamics determine stem cell functions in tissue homeostasis and cancer.","['Broske, Ann-Marie', 'Vockentanz, Lena', 'Kharazi, Shabnam', 'Huska, Matthew R', 'Mancini, Elena', 'Scheller, Marina', 'Kuhl, Christiane', 'Enns, Andreas', 'Prinz, Marco', 'Jaenisch, Rudolf', 'Nerlov, Claus', 'Leutz, Achim', 'Andrade-Navarro, Miguel A', 'Jacobsen, Sten Eirik W', 'Rosenbauer, Frank']","['Broske AM', 'Vockentanz L', 'Kharazi S', 'Huska MR', 'Mancini E', 'Scheller M', 'Kuhl C', 'Enns A', 'Prinz M', 'Jaenisch R', 'Nerlov C', 'Leutz A', 'Andrade-Navarro MA', 'Jacobsen SE', 'Rosenbauer F']","['Max Delbruck Center for Molecular Medicine, Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091004,United States,Nat Genet,Nature genetics,9216904,,2009/10/06 06:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/10/06 06:00'],"['2009/04/03 00:00 [received]', '2009/08/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/10/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['ng.463 [pii]', '10.1038/ng.463 [doi]']",ppublish,Nat Genet. 2009 Nov;41(11):1207-15. doi: 10.1038/ng.463.

Its role in lymphopoiesis is presently unknown. Recent studies have shown the nuclear expression of sox11 in mantle cell lymphoma, which raises the question about its possible association with t(11;14)(q13;q32), the genetic hallmark of mantle cell lymphoma leading to the overexpression of cyclin D1. In this study, we examined sox11 expression in 211 cases of B-cell neoplasms by immunohistochemistry, and evaluated its association with t(11;14) and overexpression of cyclin D1. Nuclear staining of sox11 was observed in 54 of 57 (95%) mantle cell lymphomas, including 52 of 53 (98%) classical and 2 of 4 variant types. Two of the three mantle cell lymphomas negative for nuclear sox11 staining were analyzed and were positive for t(11;14). All other B-cell lymphomas (114 cases) showed variable positive staining in the cytoplasm, but no nuclear positivity. Sox11 was then examined in plasma cell myeloma and hairy cell leukemia as a subset of plasma cell myeloma carry t(11;14) and overexpress cyclin D1, and cyclin D1 is overexpressed in a subset of hairy cell leukemia independent of t(11;14). We found no nuclear staining of sox11 in 30 plasma cell myelomas examined, including 12 cases with t(11;14)(q13;q32). It is interesting that intense nuclear staining of sox11 was present in a subset of hairy cell leukemias (5 of 10), and was associated with the overexpression of cyclin D1. Our results indicate that the nuclear expression of sox11 is highly associated with mantle cell lymphoma, but is independent of t(11;14)(q13;q32) in non-mantle cell B-cell neoplasms. Its association with the overexpression of cyclin D1 in hairy cell leukemia suggests that sox11 may be involved in the upregulation of cyclin D1 in this leukemia.","['Chen, Yi-Hua', 'Gao, Juehua', 'Fan, Guang', 'Peterson, LoAnn C']","['Chen YH', 'Gao J', 'Fan G', 'Peterson LC']","['Department of Pathology, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL 60611, USA. y-chen5@northwestern.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20091002,United States,Mod Pathol,"Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc",8806605,,2009/10/06 06:00,2010/03/04 06:00,['2009/10/06 06:00'],"['2009/10/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/04 06:00 [medline]']","['modpathol2009140 [pii]', '10.1038/modpathol.2009.140 [doi]']",ppublish,Mod Pathol. 2010 Jan;23(1):105-12. doi: 10.1038/modpathol.2009.140.

OBJECTIVES: To determine the incidence, risk factors, clinical data, outcome, and mortality of AP in children with ALL. METHODS: Retrospective cohort study was conducted by reviewing the data of total 192 pediatric ALL patients from Pediatric Oncology Registry at Ramathibodi Hospital from 2000 to 2006 to assess incidence, clinical data, outcome, and mortality of AP. Then, a nested case-control study was conducted to identify potential risk factors for AP by recruiting all patients with AP as cases (n=16), and randomly selected patients without AP to serve as controls up to approximately four controls per case with the total of 68 controls. RESULTS: The total incidence of AP in children with ALL and L-asp-associated AP was 8.3% and 7.3%, respectively. In patients with L-asp-associated AP, pancreatitis developed after the median 5.5 doses (range: 1 to 20 doses) of L-asp therapy and the median interval from the last dose of L-asp to the onset of AP was 4 days (range: 1 to 13 days). The mortality rate of AP group was significantly higher than the patients without AP (43.8% vs. 19.3%, P=0.02). Mortality was associated with concurrent systemic infection and complications of underlying diseases. Multivariate analysis identified using a high-risk chemotherapy regimen was the only risk factor for AP. CONCLUSIONS: Using a high-risk chemotherapy regimen was a risk factor for pancreatitis in patients with ALL. ALL children with AP had higher mortality rate than those without pancreatitis.","['Treepongkaruna, Suporn', 'Thongpak, Naporn', 'Pakakasama, Samart', 'Pienvichit, Paneeya', 'Sirachainan, Nongnuch', 'Hongeng, Suradej']","['Treepongkaruna S', 'Thongpak N', 'Pakakasama S', 'Pienvichit P', 'Sirachainan N', 'Hongeng S']","['Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Ramathibodi Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand. rastp@mahidol.ac.th']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,,2009/10/06 06:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/10/06 06:00'],"['2009/10/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/MPH.0b013e3181b87035 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2009 Nov;31(11):812-5. doi: 10.1097/MPH.0b013e3181b87035.,11,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Asparaginase/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Pancreatitis/chemically induced/*mortality', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*mortality', '*Registries', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate']",,['EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Among 2589 children with cancer treated at MD Anderson, we identified 22 patients with t-MDS/AML. Patients with t-MDS/AML had a median age of 14 years. There was a male and Hispanic predominance. The most common primary malignancies were osteosarcoma and Hodgkin lymphoma. The median latency period was 4.1 years. Three patients received supportive care only.

In the present study, the authors investigated whether mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) are involved in the costunolide-induced apoptosis in human promonocytic leukemia U937 cells. Treatment with costunolide resulted in the significant activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), but not of extracellular-signal-related kinase (ERK1/2) or p38. In vitro kinase assays showed that JNK activity was low in untreated cells but increased dramatically after 30 min of costunolide treatment. U937 cells co-treated with costunolide and sorbitol, a JNK activator, exhibited higher levels of cell death. In addition, inhibition of the JNK pathway using a dominant-negative mutation of c-jun and JNK inhibitor SP600125, significantly prevented costunolide-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, pretreatment with the antioxidant NAC (N-acetyl-L-cysteine) blocked the costunolide-stimulated activation of JNK while the overexpression of Bcl-2 failed to reverse JNK activation. Pretreatment with SP600125 recovered the costunolide-suppressed Bcl-2 expression. These results indicate that costunolide-induced JNK activation acts downstream of ROS but upstream of Bcl-2, and suggest that ROS-mediated JNK activation plays a key role in costunolide-induced apoptosis. Moreover, the administration of costunolide (intraperitoneally once a day for 7 d) significantly suppressed tumor growth and increased survival in 3LL Lewis lung carcinoma-bearing model.","['Choi, Jung-Hye', 'Lee, Kyung-Tae']","['Choi JH', 'Lee KT']","['Department of Oriental Pharmaceutical Science, College of Pharmacy, Kyung Hee University, Hoegi-Dong, Seoul 130-701, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Japan,Biol Pharm Bull,Biological & pharmaceutical bulletin,9311984,,2009/10/06 06:00,2010/01/29 06:00,['2009/10/06 06:00'],"['2009/10/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/29 06:00 [medline]']","['JST.JSTAGE/bpb/32.1803 [pii]', '10.1248/bpb.32.1803 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Pharm Bull. 2009 Oct;32(10):1803-8. doi: 10.1248/bpb.32.1803.,10,IM,"['Acetylcysteine/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/isolation & purification/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Carcinoma, Lewis Lung/drug therapy', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Free Radical Scavengers/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/enzymology/pathology', 'Magnolia/*chemistry', 'Mice', 'Phytotherapy', 'Plant Bark', 'Plant Extracts/isolation & purification/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Plant Stems', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Sesquiterpenes/isolation & purification/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Sorbitol/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'U937 Cells']",,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Free Radical Scavengers)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Sesquiterpenes)', '4IK578SA7Z (costunolide)', '506T60A25R (Sorbitol)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ROS1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'WYQ7N0BPYC (Acetylcysteine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Precursor-B-ALL is classified mainly into pro-B-ALL, common-ALL and pre-B-ALL. The Common Acute Lymphoblastic Antigen CD10 is the marker for common-ALL. OBJECTIVE: This study was aimed to examine the diversity of T-cell receptor Gamma (TCRG) and T-cell receptor Delta (TCRD) gene rearrangements in South Indian Common-ALL patients. METHODS: Clonality of TCRG and TCRD was studied in 52 cases (pediatric=41 and adolescents and young adults=11) of common-ALL. TCRG and TCRD gene rearrangements were amplified by PCR and the clonality was assessed by Heteroduplex analysis of amplified products. RESULTS: In pediatric common-ALL, clonal TCRG and TCRD gene rearrangements were detected in 19 (46.3%) and 18 (43.9%) cases respectively. In adolescents and young adults (AYA), TCRG was rearranged in 8 (72.7%) cases and TCRD was rearranged in 4 (36.3%) cases. In the present study of common-ALL, the frequency of a TCRG rearrangement VII-J1.3/2.3 was significantly high in AYA compared to pediatric (36.3% vs 4.8%; p<0.025). Thus, VII-J1.3/2.3 was highly diverse in AYA compared to pediatric. That shows the difference in biology of the disease between pediatric and AYA in South Indian population. CONCLUSION: The reason for the high frequency of VII-J1.3/2.3 in AYA of common-ALL in South Indian population in connection with unknown infectious agents or environmental carcinogens needs to be evaluated further.","['Sudhakar, Natarajan', 'Nancy, Nirmala Karunakaran', 'Rajalekshmy, Kamalalayam Raghavan', 'Rajkumar, Thangarajan']","['Sudhakar N', 'Nancy NK', 'Rajalekshmy KR', 'Rajkumar T']","['Department of Molecular Oncology, Cancer Institute, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Iran,Iran J Immunol,Iranian journal of immunology : IJI,101282932,,2009/10/06 06:00,2010/01/12 06:00,['2009/10/06 06:00'],"['2009/10/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/12 06:00 [medline]']","['04 [pii]', 'IJIv6i3A4 [doi]']",ppublish,Iran J Immunol. 2009 Sep;6(3):141-6. doi: IJIv6i3A4.,3,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', '*Gene Rearrangement, delta-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor', '*Gene Rearrangement, gamma-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor', 'Genetic Variation', 'Humans', 'India', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta/*genetics', 'Young Adult']",,"['0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

BCR-ABL kinase domain mutation is the commonest mechanism implicated in imatinib resistance. In in-vitro studies, kinase domain mutations are variably resistant to second-line agents. We performed BCR-ABL kinase domain mutational studies in 25 patients in five institutions who failed imatinib and were treated with either nilotinib or dasatinib, to see if their mutational status would predict their clinical responses. Kinase domain mutations involving 11 amino acid substitutions were found in 12 (48%) patients. Most patients showed single kinase domain mutations. There was some concordance between reported drug sensitivity patterns and patient responses. Discordant responses could be related to drug dosage variations and unknown BCR-ABL independent mechanisms. The response prediction for patients with multiple kinase domain mutations was challenging and their mutational patterns could change after tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy. Although BCR-ABL kinase domain mutational analysis has limitations as a means of predicting the clinical response to second-line tyrosine kinase inhibitors, it helps inform therapy decisions in the management of chronic myeloid leukaemia after imatinib failure.","['Kwan, T K', 'Ma, Edmond S K', 'Chan, Y Y', 'Wan, Thomas S K', 'Liu, Herman S Y', 'Sim, Joycelyn P Y', 'Yeung, Y M', 'Lie, Albert K W', 'Yip, S F']","['Kwan TK', 'Ma ES', 'Chan YY', 'Wan TS', 'Liu HS', 'Sim JP', 'Yeung YM', 'Lie AK', 'Yip SF']","['Department of Pathology, Queen Mary Hospital, Pokfulam Road, Hong Kong.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,China,Hong Kong Med J,Hong Kong medical journal = Xianggang yi xue za zhi,9512509,,2009/10/06 06:00,2010/01/01 06:00,['2009/10/06 06:00'],"['2009/10/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/01 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Hong Kong Med J. 2009 Oct;15(5):365-73.,5,IM,"['Amino Acid Substitution', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Dasatinib', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Mutation', 'Piperazines/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*genetics', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Thiazoles/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome']",,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bacterial propionyl-CoA synthetase and human histone H4 are propionylated at specific lysine residues that have been known previously to be acetylated. However, other proteins subject to this modification remain to be identified, and the modifying enzymes involved need to be characterized. In this work, we report the discovery of histone H3 propionylation in mammalian cells. Propionylation at H3 lysine Lys(23) was detected in the leukemia cell line U937 by mass spectrometry and Western analysis using a specific antibody. In this cell line, the propionylated form of Lys(23) accounted for 7%, a level at least 6-fold higher than in other leukemia cell lines (HL-60 and THP-1) or non-leukemia cell lines (HeLa and IMR-90). The propionylation level in U937 cells decreased remarkably during monocytic differentiation, indicating that this modification is dynamically regulated. Moreover, in vitro assays demonstrated that histone acetyltransferase p300 can catalyze H3 Lys(23) propionylation, whereas histone deacetylase Sir2 can remove this modification in the presence of NAD(+). These results suggest that histone propionylation might be generated by the same set of enzymes as for histone acetylation and that selection of donor molecules (propionyl-CoA versus acetyl-CoA) may determine the difference of modifications. Because like acetyl-CoA, propionyl-CoA is an important intermediate in biosynthesis and energy production, histone H3 Lys(23) propionylation may provide a novel epigenetic regulatory mark for cell metabolism.","['Liu, Bo', 'Lin, Yihui', 'Darwanto, Agus', 'Song, Xuehui', 'Xu, Guoliang', 'Zhang, Kangling']","['Liu B', 'Lin Y', 'Darwanto A', 'Song X', 'Xu G', 'Zhang K']","['State Key Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 200031, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091003,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,PMC2781642,2009/10/06 06:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/10/06 06:00'],"['2009/10/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)37819-4 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M109.045856 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2009 Nov 20;284(47):32288-95. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M109.045856.

ICSBP regulates genes that are involved in phagocyte function, proliferation, and apoptosis. In murine models ICSBP deficiency results in a myeloproliferative disorder (MPD) with increased mature neutrophils. Over time this MPD progresses to acute myeloid leukemia (AML), suggesting that ICSBP deficiency is adequate for MPD, but additional genetic lesions are required for AML. The hypothesis of these studies is that dysregulation of key target genes predisposes to disease progression under conditions of decreased ICSBP expression. To investigate this hypothesis, we used chromatin co-immunoprecipitation to identify genes involved the ICSBP-leukemia suppressor effect. In the current studies, we identify the gene encoding Fanconi F (FANCF) as an ICSBP target gene. FancF participates in a repair of cross-linked DNA. We identify a FANCF promoter cis element, which is activated by ICSBP in differentiating myeloid cells. We also determine that DNA cross-link repair is impaired in ICSBP-deficient myeloid cells in a FancF-dependent manner. This effect is observed in differentiating cells, suggesting that ICSBP protects against the genotoxic stress of myelopoiesis. Decreased ICSBP expression is found in human AML and chronic myeloid leukemia during blast crisis (CML-BC). Our studies suggest that ICSBP deficiency may be functionally important for accumulation of chromosomal abnormalities during disease progression in these myeloid malignancies.","['Saberwal, Gurveen', 'Horvath, Elizabeth', 'Hu, Liping', 'Zhu, Chunliu', 'Hjort, Elizabeth', 'Eklund, Elizabeth A']","['Saberwal G', 'Horvath E', 'Hu L', 'Zhu C', 'Hjort E', 'Eklund EA']","['The Feinberg School of Medicine and Robert H.

We report an original case of bilateral xanthelasma palpebrarum associated with juvenile xanthogranuloma (JXG) in a 7-year-old child. Only two cases of xanthelasma in children have been described to date. The association of xanthelasma and JXG has never been described. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A 7-year-old boy presented xanthelasmas on both eyelids. At the same time, pinkish JXG papules appeared on the child's trunk. The boy had been diagnosed at the age of 10 months with myelogenous leukaemia, which was in remission. He also had a familial history of hypercholesterolaemia. The skin lesions were removed and microscopic examination confirmed the diagnosis of xanthelasmas and JXG. DISCUSSION: This patient's presentation is unusual in several respects: the presence of xanthelasma in a child, appearance of JXG at an advanced age, and the association of these two diseases in a child with a past history of leukaemia. The occurrence of these skin lesions did not appear to be linked to the history of malignant blood disease in this patient.","['Le Bidre, E', 'Delage, M', 'Lejars, O', 'Machet, M-C', 'Lorette, G', 'Maruani, A']","['Le Bidre E', 'Delage M', 'Lejars O', 'Machet MC', 'Lorette G', 'Maruani A']","['Universite Francois-Rabelais, Tours, France. emmanuelle_lb@yahoo.fr']",['fre'],"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",20090515,France,Ann Dermatol Venereol,Annales de dermatologie et de venereologie,7702013,,2009/10/06 06:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/10/06 06:00'],"['2008/05/13 00:00 [received]', '2009/01/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/10/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S0151-9638(09)00203-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.annder.2009.01.017 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Dermatol Venereol. 2009 Oct;136(10):723-6. doi: 10.1016/j.annder.2009.01.017.

Procoagulant release and tissue factor expression on tumor cells are considered to contribute to chemotherapeutic agents-associated coagulopathy. The role of red blood cells during this process has not been determined; although they lack tissue factor, they may contribute suitable membranes for the amplification phase of blood coagulation. The present study aims to evaluate the possible impact of daunorubicin on phosphatidylserine exposure and consequent procoagulant property of red blood cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Red blood cells from acute myeloid leukemia patients and healthy donors were treated with daunorubicin as well as all-trans-retinoic acid, arsenic trioxide or etoposide for 0-48 h. Procoagulant activity was assessed by measurement of a clotting time and by purified coagulation complex assays. Lactadherin was used as a probe for phosphatidylserine. RESULTS: Daunorubicin treatment increased procoagulant activity of red blood cells regardless of the cell origin. Moreover, coagulation complexes assays supported daunorubicin-evoked procoagulant response. The procoagulant property of red blood cells was not affected by the other three agents. The modulating effect of procoagulant activity was concomitant with and dependent on level of phosphatidylserine on the outer surface. Blockade of phosphatidylserine with lactadherin inhibited over 90% of tenase generation and prothrombinase activity and prolonged the coagulation time. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that daunorubicin interacts with red blood cells in a manner that increases phosphatidylserine exposure and consequent procoagulant activity. Lactadherin is an efficient anticoagulant of this process.","['Zhou, Jin', 'Zheng, Yining', 'Shi, Jialan', 'Lu, Chengfang', 'Hou, Jinxiao', 'Yu, Hongjuan', 'Qiao, Xin', 'Qi, Sen', 'Gilbert, Gary E']","['Zhou J', 'Zheng Y', 'Shi J', 'Lu C', 'Hou J', 'Yu H', 'Qiao X', 'Qi S', 'Gilbert GE']","['Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital, Harbin Medical University, Harbin 150001, China. zhoujin1111@126.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091002,United States,Thromb Res,Thrombosis research,0326377,,2009/10/06 06:00,2010/05/14 06:00,['2009/10/06 06:00'],"['2009/03/21 00:00 [received]', '2009/08/04 00:00 [revised]', '2009/09/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/10/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/14 06:00 [medline]']","['S0049-3848(09)00399-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.thromres.2009.09.006 [doi]']",ppublish,Thromb Res. 2010 Feb;125(2):178-83. doi: 10.1016/j.thromres.2009.09.006.

Advancing a compound toward the clinic, however, generally requires the identification of precise mechanisms of action. We previously found that epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors induce acute myeloid leukemia (AML) differentiation via a non-EGFR mechanism. In this report, we integrated proteomic and RNAi-based strategies to identify their off-target, anti-AML mechanism. These orthogonal approaches identified Syk as a target in AML. Genetic and pharmacological inactivation of Syk with a drug in clinical trial for other indications promoted differentiation of AML cells and attenuated leukemia growth in vivo. These results demonstrate the power of integrating diverse chemical, proteomic, and genomic screening approaches to identify therapeutic strategies for cancer.","['Hahn, Cynthia K', 'Berchuck, Jacob E', 'Ross, Kenneth N', 'Kakoza, Rose M', 'Clauser, Karl', 'Schinzel, Anna C', 'Ross, Linda', 'Galinsky, Ilene', 'Davis, Tina N', 'Silver, Serena J', 'Root, David E', 'Stone, Richard M', 'DeAngelo, Daniel J', 'Carroll, Martin', 'Hahn, William C', 'Carr, Steven A', 'Golub, Todd R', 'Kung, Andrew L', 'Stegmaier, Kimberly']","['Hahn CK', 'Berchuck JE', 'Ross KN', 'Kakoza RM', 'Clauser K', 'Schinzel AC', 'Ross L', 'Galinsky I', 'Davis TN', 'Silver SJ', 'Root DE', 'Stone RM', 'DeAngelo DJ', 'Carroll M', 'Hahn WC', 'Carr SA', 'Golub TR', 'Kung AL', 'Stegmaier K']","[""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Children's Hospital Boston, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cancer Cell,Cancer cell,101130617,PMC2803063,2009/10/06 06:00,2009/10/16 06:00,['2009/10/06 06:00'],"['2009/01/28 00:00 [received]', '2009/07/08 00:00 [revised]', '2009/08/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/10/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S1535-6108(09)00291-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ccr.2009.08.018 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Cell. 2009 Oct 6;16(4):281-94. doi: 10.1016/j.ccr.2009.08.018.,4,IM,"['Aminopyridines', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Gefitinib', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', '*Genomics/methods', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Morpholines', 'Oxazines/pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', '*Proteomics/methods', 'Pyridines/pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines', 'Quinazolines/pharmacology', 'RNA Interference', 'Syk Kinase', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tyrosine', 'U937 Cells', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,"['0 (Aminopyridines)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Morpholines)', '0 (Oxazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Quinazolines)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (SYK protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Syk Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Syk protein, mouse)', 'S65743JHBS (Gefitinib)', 'SQ8A3S5101 (fostamatinib)']",,,"['K08 CA098444/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K08 CA098444-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HHMI/Howard Hughes Medical Institute/United States', '5K08 CA098444/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['Cancer Cell. 2009 Oct 6;16(4):270-1.

Plasma circulating HSP70 (cHSP70) is believed to play a role in the anti-tumor immune responses and its levels may reflect the levels of severity or the disease condition. Using electrochemiluminescence protein detection immunoassay, we measured the cHSP70 levels in the plasma of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (n=96), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) (n=28), and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (n=40) and compared with those in normal individuals (n=99). cHSP70 levels were significantly higher in AML (median: 10.71 ng/mL, range: 1.93-79.0 ng/mL) and ALL (median: 27.59 ng/mL, range: 5.09-129.6 ng/mL) as compared to those in MDS (median: 4.54 ng/mL, range: 1.35-58.3 ng/mL) or healthy controls (median: 4.13 ng/mL, range: 1.75-13.6 ng/mL). Levels of cHSP70 showed significant positive correlation with lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and white blood cells (WBC) in AML and ALL patients, which may reflect overall tumor load. Furthermore, patients with higher levels of cHSP70 had significantly shorter survival in AML (P=0.04) and ALL (P=0.05), suggesting that in these two acute diseases, cHSP70 is an indicator for poor prognosis.

The outcomes of BMT from a VUD in 125 children with Ph+ CML were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were identified through the Japan Marrow Donor Program as having undergone BMT between 1993 and 2005 and were aged 1-19 years at the time of transplant (median age, 14 years). The probabilities of 5-year overall survival (OS) and leukemia-free survival (LFS) were 59.3% and 55.5%, respectively. Multivariate analysis identified the following unfavorable survival factors: infused total nucleated cell dose<314 x 10(6) /kg (relative risk [RR]=2.43; 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.33-4.44; P=.004), advanced phase (RR=2.43; 95% CI=1.37-4.31; P=.004), and no major cytogenetic response (MCyR) at the time of BMT (RR=6.55; 95% CI=1.98-21.6; P=.002). Of the 17 patients treated with imatinib, 15 (88%) achieved MCyR at the time of BMT, and this group had an excellent 5-year OS of 81.9%.

However, the precise mechanisms and the proteins modulated by LATS1/2 that are responsible for these events remain largely unknown. To elucidate potential signaling pathways, the current study investigated the expression profile in HeLa cells with reduced expression of LATS1/2. Using RNA-mediated interference, both LATS1 and LATS2 were substantially knocked-down, and accordingly, this lead to an increase in multiple phenotypes associated with tumor progression, including enhanced cell proliferation, resistance to drug-induced cell death, and increased cell migration. Using whole human genome Oligo (60-mer) arrays (Agilent), genes modulated by loss of LATS1/2 were identified and functionally grouped into categories including cell proliferation, cell death, cell adhesion and motility, as well as cell communication. Selected genes, including known tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes such as CDKN1A, WISP2, SLIT2, TP53INP1, BIRC4BP, SPRY2, SPRY4, SPRED1, FAT4, and CYR61 were confirmed by qRT-PCR to be significantly differentially expressed. Importantly, the collection of genes identified suggests that LATS1/2 function through diverse mechanisms and multiple signaling pathways including the Hippo signaling pathway, as well as the p53, Ras-ERK, or WNT networks, to inhibit tumor progression.","['Visser, Stacy', 'Yang, Xiaolong']","['Visser S', 'Yang X']","[""Department of Pathology and Molecular Medicine, Queen's University, Kingston, ON, Canada K7L 3N6.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090930,Netherlands,Gene,Gene,7706761,,2009/10/06 06:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/10/06 06:00'],"['2009/04/02 00:00 [received]', '2009/09/16 00:00 [revised]', '2009/09/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/10/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S0378-1119(09)00498-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.gene.2009.09.008 [doi]']",ppublish,Gene. 2010 Jan 1;449(1-2):22-9. doi: 10.1016/j.gene.2009.09.008.

A range of chromatographic methods was used for isolation and its antibacterial activity against Bacillus subtilis was employed to screen for the most active fractions. The peptide, termed SK84 due to its N-terminal serine, C-terminal lysine and a total of 84 residues, was completed sequenced using RT-PCR cDNA cloning. SK84 contains a high level of glycine (15.5%) and a hexaglycine cluster motif in the N-terminal part. SK84 displayed antibacterial activity against the tested Gram-positive bacteria (B. subtilis, Bacillus thuringiensis and Staphylococcus aureus), but had no effect on Gram-negative bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli) and fungi (Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Candida albicans). SK84 had specific inhibitory effects on the proliferation of several cancer cell lines (Human leukemia THP-1, liver cancer HepG2, and breast cancer MCF-7 cells), but no hemolytic activity. The results from scanning electron microscopy observations revealed that SK84 killed THP-1 cells by destroying the cell membranes. Alignment results show that SK84 is a mature protein processed from the pseudoprotein GJ19999 from D. virilis, and is very similar to several pseudoproteins from different Drosophila species. Our results show that SK84 represents a novel glycine-rich peptide family in Drosophila species with antimicrobial and anti-cancer cell activities.","['Lu, Jie', 'Chen, Zheng-wang']","['Lu J', 'Chen ZW']","['Key Laboratory of Molecular Biophysics of the Ministry of Education, Institute of Biophysical and Biochemistry, College of Life Science and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090930,United States,Peptides,Peptides,8008690,,2009/10/06 06:00,2010/04/23 06:00,['2009/10/06 06:00'],"['2009/08/15 00:00 [received]', '2009/09/22 00:00 [revised]', '2009/09/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/10/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/23 06:00 [medline]']","['S0196-9781(09)00415-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.peptides.2009.09.028 [doi]']",ppublish,Peptides. 2010 Jan;31(1):44-50. doi: 10.1016/j.peptides.2009.09.028.

To identify its interaction partners, we expressed a tandem epitope-tagged protein in murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells and characterized affinity-purified Tal1-containing complexes by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis. In addition to known interacting proteins, two proteins related to the Eight-Twenty-One (ETO) corepressor, Eto2/Mtg16 and Mtgr1, were identified from the peptide fragments analyzed. Tal1 interaction with Eto2 and Mtgr1 was verified by coimmunoprecipitation analysis in Tal1, Eto2-, and Mtgr1-transfected COS-7 cells, MEL cells expressing V5 epitope-tagged Tal1 protein, and non-transfected MEL cells. Mapping analysis with Gal4 fusion proteins demonstrated a requirement for the bHLH domain of Tal1 and TAF110 domain of Eto2 for their interaction, and transient transfection and glutathione S-transferase pull-down analysis showed that Mtgr1 and Eto2 enhanced the other's association with Tal1. Enforced expression of Eto2 in differentiating MEL cells inhibited the promoter of the Protein 4.2 (P4.2) gene, a direct target of TAL1 in erythroid progenitors, and transduction of Eto2 and Mtgr1 augmented Tal1-mediated gene repression. Finally, chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that Eto2 occupancy of the P4.2 promoter in MEL cells decreased with differentiation, in parallel with a decline in Eto2 protein abundance. These results identify Eto2 and Mtgr1 as authentic interaction partners of Tal1 and suggest they act as heteromeric corepressors of this bHLH transcription factor during erythroid differentiation.","['Cai, Ying', 'Xu, Zhixiong', 'Xie, Jingping', 'Ham, Amy-Joan L', 'Koury, Mark J', 'Hiebert, Scott W', 'Brandt, Stephen J']","['Cai Y', 'Xu Z', 'Xie J', 'Ham AJ', 'Koury MJ', 'Hiebert SW', 'Brandt SJ']","['Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN 37232, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20090930,United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,PMC2774815,2009/10/06 06:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/10/06 06:00'],"['2009/09/11 00:00 [received]', '2009/09/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/10/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-291X(09)01928-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2009.09.111 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2009 Dec 11;390(2):295-301. doi: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2009.09.111.

This study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of modified Hyper-CVAD regimen on Chinese patients with aggressive NHL. METHODS: Clinical records of 31 NHL patients who received modified Hyper-CVAD regimen in Cancer Hospital of Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences from June 2004 to June 2008 were analyzed in terms of toxicity and response. RESULTS: The 31 patients totally received 91 cycles of regimen A and 41 cycles of regimen B with a median of 4 cycles (ranged 1-7 cycles). The major toxicity was myelosuppresion: the occurrence rates of neutropenia of grades III-IV, thrombocytopenia and febrile neutropenia were 49.5%, 3.3% and 12.1% during treatment of regimen A, and were 80.5%, 82.9% and 46.3% during treatment of regimen B. No treatment-related death was observed. The responses were assessable in 26 patients. The total response rate was 80.8%, and 12 patients achieved complete response (46.2%).

No conventional chemotherapy regimen has appeared successful in patients with ATL, thus establishing effective therapy is urgently required. In some cases, ATL tumor cells express CD30 on the cell surface, therefore, a therapy with mAb against CD30 would be beneficial. To investigate the effect of CD30-mediated therapy on ATL, we assessed SGN-30, a chimeric anti-CD30 mAb, and SGN-35, a monomethyl auristatin E-conjugated anti-CD30 mAb, in vitro and in vivo. Three HTLV-I-infected cell lines were co-cultured with SGN-30 or SGN-35, and the growth-inhibitory effects on the HTLV-I-infected cells were evaluated using an in vitro cell proliferation assay and cell cycle analysis. SGN-30 and SGN-35 showed growth-inhibitory activity against the HTLV-I-infected cell lines by apoptosis and/or cell growth arrest in vitro. To further investigate the effects of SGN-30 and SGN-35 on HTLV-I-infected cells in vivo, we used NOD/SCID mice subcutaneously engrafted with HTLV-I-infected cells. Both mAbs significantly inhibited the growth of HTLV-I-infected cell tumors in the NOD/SCID murine xenograft models.

We have previously reported characterization of the SOX3 promoter and demonstrated that the general transcription factors NF-Y (nuclear factor-Y), Sp1 (specificity protein 1) and USF (upstream stimulatory factor) are involved in transcriptional regulation of SOX3 promoter activity. In the present study we provide the first evidence that the TALE (three-amino-acid loop extension) transcription factors PBX1 (pre-B-cell leukaemia homeobox 1) and MEIS1 (myeloid ecotropic viral integration site 1 homologue) participate in regulating human SOX3 gene expression in NT2/D1 cells by direct interaction with the consensus PBX/MEIS-binding site, which is conserved in all mammalian orthologue promoters analysed. PBX1 is present in the protein complex formed at this site with nuclear proteins from uninduced cells, whereas both PBX1 and MEIS1 proteins were detected in the complex created with extract from RA (retinoic acid)-induced NT2/D1 cells. By functional analysis we also showed that mutations of the PBX1/MEIS1-binding sites resulted in profound reduction of SOX3 promoter responsiveness to RA. Finally, we demonstrated that overexpressed PBX1 and MEIS1 increased endogenous SOX3 protein expression in both uninduced and RA-induced NT2/D1 cells. With the results of the present study, for the first time, we have established a functional link between the TALE proteins, PBX1 and MEIS1, and expression of the human SOX3 gene. This link is of particular interest since both TALE family members and members of the SOX superfamily are recognized as important developmental regulators.","['Mojsin, Marija', 'Stevanovic, Milena']","['Mojsin M', 'Stevanovic M']","['Institute of Molecular Genetics and Genetic Engineering, University of Belgrade, Vojvode Stepe 444a, PO Box 23, 11010 Belgrade, Serbia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091214,England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,,2009/10/06 06:00,2010/01/22 06:00,['2009/10/06 06:00'],"['2009/10/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/22 06:00 [medline]']","['BJ20090694 [pii]', '10.1042/BJ20090694 [doi]']",epublish,Biochem J. 2009 Dec 14;425(1):107-16. doi: 10.1042/BJ20090694.,1,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites/genetics', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Consensus Sequence', 'DNA Footprinting', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Deoxyribonuclease I/metabolism', 'Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Mutation', 'Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/*genetics', 'Protein Binding', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'SOXB1 Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (MEIS1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (SOX3 protein, human)', '0 (SOXB1 Transcription Factors)', '0 (pbx1 protein, human)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 3.1.21.1 (Deoxyribonuclease I)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Lipid rafts are assumed to play an essential role in the interactions between cell membrane and cortical cytoskeleton. As we have shown earlier, the activity of non-voltage-gated sodium channels in K562 human leukaemia cells is critically dependent on actin cytoskeleton organization. In the present paper, functional properties of sodium channels in K562 cells were examined after cholesterol-depleting treatment using methyl-beta-cyclodextrin (MbCD), selective acceptor of sterols. Single currents through sodium channels were recorded in cell-attached and inside-out mode experiments with the use of patch clamp technique. After incubation with MbCD (2.5 or 5.0 mM), an activation of sodium channels in response to cytochalasin B or D was observed in membrane fragments as well as in native cells. Characteristics of the channels in cholesterol-depleted K562 cells were similar to those in control; unitary conductance was 12 pS. Inside-out experiments with the use of globular actin have indicated that filament assembly on cytoplasmic membrane side causes an inactivation of sodium channels. These data imply that there is no association of sodium channels with cholesterol-rich membrane microdomains in K562 cells. Possible mechanisms underlying an interplay between plasma membrane and cortical cytoskeleton are discussed.","['Sudarikova, A V', 'Chubinskii-Nadezhdin, V I', 'Neguliaev, Iu A', 'Morachevskaia, E A']","['Sudarikova AV', 'Chubinskii-Nadezhdin VI', 'Neguliaev IuA', 'Morachevskaia EA']",,['rus'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Russia (Federation),Tsitologiia,Tsitologiia,0417363,,2009/10/06 06:00,2009/11/18 06:00,['2009/10/06 06:00'],"['2009/10/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/11/18 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Tsitologiia. 2009;51(8):676-83.,8,IM,"['Anticholesteremic Agents/pharmacology', 'Cholesterol/*metabolism', 'Cytochalasin B/pharmacology', 'Cytochalasin D/pharmacology', 'Electric Conductivity', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Membrane Microdomains/*metabolism', 'Sodium Channel Agonists', 'Sodium Channels/*physiology', 'beta-Cyclodextrins/pharmacology']",,"['0 (Anticholesteremic Agents)', '0 (Sodium Channel Agonists)', '0 (Sodium Channels)', '0 (beta-Cyclodextrins)', '0 (methyl-beta-cyclodextrin)', '22144-77-0 (Cytochalasin D)', '3CHI920QS7 (Cytochalasin B)', '97C5T2UQ7J (Cholesterol)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To explore the possibility of application of wild-type p53 gene therapy in the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia. METHODS: The recombinant adenoviruses carrying wild-type p53 gene (Ad5 wtp53), mutant p53 gene (Ad5 mtp53) or the green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene was repeatedly amplified and co-infected into K562 cells with cation polybrene. The optimal infection titer and infection time of the recombinant adenoviruses were determined by MTT assay, p53 mRNA and protein expression were determined by RT-PCR and Western blot respectively. The centrosomal structural protein gamma-tubulin and the spindle protein alpha-tubulin were marked simultaneously by indirect immunofluorescence staining, and the expression of the centrosomal gamma-tubulin protein, the mitosis and the number of centrosome were observed under the laser confocal microscopy. RESULTS: Infection efficiency with recombinant adenoviruses was facilitated by polybrene in K562 cells, and 4 microg/ml polybrene was chosen. The optimal adenovirus infection titer was 20,000 MOI and the optimal infection time was 72 hours. p53 mRNA and P53 protein can be expressed in K562 cells by Ad5wtp53 and Ad5mtp53. Both the expression of the centrosomal gamma-tubulin protein and the number of centrosomes were decreased after Ad5wtp53 infection. CONCLUSION: There is sustained expression of P53 protein in K562 cells after its infection by Ad5wtp53. Wild-type P53 protein can lead to the down-regulation of the number of centrosomes and the expression of centrosomal gamma-tubulin protein in K562 cells.","['Wang, Hong-bin', 'Feng, Wen-li', 'Huang, Shi-feng', 'Tian, Wen-jun', 'Cao, Wei-xi', 'Huang, Zong-gan']","['Wang HB', 'Feng WL', 'Huang SF', 'Tian WJ', 'Cao WX', 'Huang ZG']","['Department of Clinical Hematology, Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medical Diagnostics of Ministry of Education, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400016, China.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,China,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua xue ye xue za zhi = Zhonghua xueyexue zazhi,8212398,,2009/10/06 06:00,2010/12/14 06:00,['2009/10/06 06:00'],"['2009/10/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/14 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2009 May;30(5):326-31.,5,IM,"['Adenoviridae/genetics', 'Centrosome/*metabolism', 'Genes, p53/*genetics', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Transfection', 'Tubulin/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism']",,"['0 (Tubulin)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We used suppression of mortality by antisense rescue technique (SMART) to screen the key genes responsible for the tumor-selective killing by trichostatin A (TSA). Twenty-four genes were identified, the most significant of which was ubiquitin B (UbB). The expression of UbB was selectively upregulated by TSA in tumor cells, but not non-malignant cells. Further observation indicated that TSA induced a substantial dissipation of mitochondrial transmembrane potential, release of cytochrome c into the cytosol, and proteolytic cleavage of caspases-3/9 in HeLa cells, which was apparently mediated by ubiquitylation and the subsequent degradation of mitochondrial membrane proteins including BCL-2 and MCL-1. In contrast, knockdown of UbB expression inhibited the TSA-induced apoptotic cascade by abolishing TSA-induced ubiquitylation and the subsequent degradation of mitochondrial membrane proteins. Furthermore, apicidine, another HDACi, exhibited activity similar to that of TSA. Interestingly, TSA induced UbB-dependent proteasomal degradation of BCR-ABL fusion protein in K562 leukemic cells. Thus, our findings highlight the essential role of UbB and UbB-dependent proteasomal protein degradation in HDACi-induced tumor selectivity. The mechanism provides a novel starting point for dissecting the molecular mechanism underlying the tumor selectivity of HDACi.","['Wu, P', 'Tian, Y', 'Chen, G', 'Wang, B', 'Gui, L', 'Xi, L', 'Ma, X', 'Fang, Y', 'Zhu, T', 'Wang, D', 'Meng, L', 'Xu, G', 'Wang, S', 'Ma, D', 'Zhou, J']","['Wu P', 'Tian Y', 'Chen G', 'Wang B', 'Gui L', 'Xi L', 'Ma X', 'Fang Y', 'Zhu T', 'Wang D', 'Meng L', 'Xu G', 'Wang S', 'Ma D', 'Zhou J']","[""Cancer Biology Research Center, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Cell Death Differ,Cell death and differentiation,9437445,,2009/10/03 06:00,2010/02/25 06:00,['2009/10/03 06:00'],"['2009/10/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/25 06:00 [medline]']","['cdd2009142 [pii]', '10.1038/cdd.2009.142 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Death Differ. 2010 Jan;17(1):109-18. doi: 10.1038/cdd.2009.142.,1,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Caspase 9/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'HeLa Cells', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/*pharmacology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'Ubiquitin/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Ubiquitination', 'Up-Regulation']",,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (UBB protein, human)', '0 (Ubiquitin)', '3X2S926L3Z (trichostatin A)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)']",,,,,['Cell Death Differ. 2021 Jul 30;:.

The second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) dasatinib and nilotinib offer improved potency and a high likelihood of success for these patients. Overall, the efficacy data are comparable for these two agents, and so physicians should consider the BCR-ABL mutation profile and the patient's history to make an educated decision on the best choice. Only a few BCR-ABL mutations seem to be less responsive to either nilotinib or dasatinib and it is recommended to choose the second-line TKI that has shown clinical activity against the specific mutation in these cases. For patients with all other mutations, and for patients with no mutations, it is recommended to choose the second-generation TKI based on the patient's disease history. It is important to choose an agent that minimizes the likelihood of exacerbating the patient's past tolerability issues to imatinib, or comorbid conditions.

Although morphologically similar, several subtypes of the disease have been identified at the genetic and molecular level. These genetic subtypes are associated with unique clinicopathological features and dissimilar outcome. At the top hierarchical level, myeloma can be divided into hyperdiploid and non-hyperdiploid subtypes. The latter is mainly composed of cases harboring IgH translocations, generally associated with more aggressive clinical features and shorter survival. The three main IgH translocations in myeloma are the t(11;14)(q13;q32), t(4;14)(p16;q32) and t(14;16)(q32;q23). Trisomies and a more indolent form of the disease characterize hyperdiploid myeloma. A number of genetic progression factors have been identified including deletions of chromosomes 13 and 17 and abnormalities of chromosome 1 (1p deletion and 1q amplification). Other key drivers of cell survival and proliferation have also been identified such as nuclear factor- B-activating mutations and other deregulation factors for the cyclin-dependent pathways regulators. Further understanding of the biological subtypes of the disease has come from the application of novel techniques such as gene expression profiling and array-based comparative genomic hybridization. The combination of data arising from these studies and that previously elucidated through other mechanisms allows for most myeloma cases to be classified under one of several genetic subtypes. This paper proposes a framework for the classification of myeloma subtypes and provides recommendations for genetic testing. This group proposes that genetic testing needs to be incorporated into daily clinical practice and also as an essential component of all ongoing and future clinical trials.","['Fonseca, R', 'Bergsagel, P L', 'Drach, J', 'Shaughnessy, J', 'Gutierrez, N', 'Stewart, A K', 'Morgan, G', 'Van Ness, B', 'Chesi, M', 'Minvielle, S', 'Neri, A', 'Barlogie, B', 'Kuehl, W M', 'Liebisch, P', 'Davies, F', 'Chen-Kiang, S', 'Durie, B G M', 'Carrasco, R', 'Sezer, Orhan', 'Reiman, Tony', 'Pilarski, Linda', 'Avet-Loiseau, H']","['Fonseca R', 'Bergsagel PL', 'Drach J', 'Shaughnessy J', 'Gutierrez N', 'Stewart AK', 'Morgan G', 'Van Ness B', 'Chesi M', 'Minvielle S', 'Neri A', 'Barlogie B', 'Kuehl WM', 'Liebisch P', 'Davies F', 'Chen-Kiang S', 'Durie BG', 'Carrasco R', 'Sezer O', 'Reiman T', 'Pilarski L', 'Avet-Loiseau H']","['Department of Hematology-Oncology, Mayo Clinic, 13400 East Shea Boulevard, Scottsdale, AR 85259-5494, USA. fonseca.rafael@mayo.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Practice Guideline', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",20091001,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,PMC2964268,2009/10/03 06:00,2010/01/15 06:00,['2009/10/03 06:00'],"['2009/10/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/15 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2009174 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2009.174 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2009 Dec;23(12):2210-21. doi: 10.1038/leu.2009.174.

This study investigated the long-term repopulating capacity and redistribution kinetics of human cord blood-derived CD34(-) severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID)-repopulating cells (SRCs) and compared them with those of CD34(+)CD38(+) and CD34(+)CD38(-) SRCs using the intra-bone marrow injection (IBMI) to clarify the characteristics of CD34(-) SRCs. On the basis of the limiting dilution analyses data, estimated numbers of CD34(+)CD38(+), CD34(+)CD38(-), and CD34(-) SRCs were transplanted to NOD/SCID mice by IBMI. The human cell repopulation at the site of injection and the other bones were serially investigated. Interestingly, CD34(+)CD38(+), CD34(+)CD38(-), and CD34(-) SRCs began to migrate to other bones 2 and 5 weeks after the transplantation, respectively. Accordingly, the initiation of migration seemed to differ between the CD34(+) and CD34(-) SRCs. In addition, CD34(+)CD38(+) SRCs only sustained a short-term repopulation. However, both CD34(+)CD38(-) and CD34(-) SRCs had longer-term repopulation capacity. Taken together, these findings showed that CD34(-) SRCs show different in vivo kinetics, thus suggesting that the identified CD34(-) SRCs are a distinct class of primitive HSCs in comparison to the CD34(+)CD38(+) and CD34(+)CD38(-) SRCs.","['Kimura, T', 'Matsuoka, Y', 'Murakami, M', 'Kimura, T', 'Takahashi, M', 'Nakamoto, T', 'Yasuda, K', 'Matsui, K', 'Kobayashi, K', 'Imai, S', 'Asano, H', 'Nakatsuka, R', 'Uemura, Y', 'Sasaki, Y', 'Sonoda, Y']","['Kimura T', 'Matsuoka Y', 'Murakami M', 'Kimura T', 'Takahashi M', 'Nakamoto T', 'Yasuda K', 'Matsui K', 'Kobayashi K', 'Imai S', 'Asano H', 'Nakatsuka R', 'Uemura Y', 'Sasaki Y', 'Sonoda Y']","['Department of Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Graduate School of Medical Science, Kansai Medical University, 10-15 Fumizonocho, Moriguchi, Osaka 570-8506, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091001,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,2009/10/03 06:00,2010/01/28 06:00,['2009/10/03 06:00'],"['2009/10/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/28 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2009206 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2009.206 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2010 Jan;24(1):162-8. doi: 10.1038/leu.2009.206.

In contrast to its physiological counterpart c-ABL, the BCR/ABL kinase is constitutively activated, inducing the leukemic phenotype. The N-terminus of c-ABL (Cap region) contributes to the regulation of its kinase function. It is myristoylated, and the myristate residue binds to a hydrophobic pocket in the kinase domain known as the myristoyl-binding pocket in a process called 'capping', which results in an auto-inhibited conformation. Because the cap region is replaced by the N-terminus of BCR, the BCR/ABL 'escapes' this auto-inhibition. Allosteric inhibition by myristate 'mimics', such as GNF-2, is able to inhibit unmutated BCR/ABL, but not the BCR/ABL that harbors the 'gatekeeper' mutation T315I. In this study, we analyzed the possibility of increasing the efficacy of allosteric inhibition by blocking BCR/ABL oligomerization. We showed that inhibition of oligomerization was able to not only increase the efficacy of GNF-2 on unmutated BCR/ABL, but also overcome the resistance of BCR/ABL-T315I to allosteric inhibition. These results strongly suggest that the response to allosteric inhibition by GNF-2 is inversely related to the degree of oligomerization of BCR/ABL. In summary, our observations establish a new approach for the molecular targeting of BCR/ABL and its resistant mutants represented by the combination of oligomerization and allosteric inhibitors.","['Mian, A A', 'Oancea, C', 'Zhao, Z', 'Ottmann, O G', 'Ruthardt, M']","['Mian AA', 'Oancea C', 'Zhao Z', 'Ottmann OG', 'Ruthardt M']","['Department of Hematology, Goethe University, Klinikum der Goethe Universitat Frankfurt, Theodor Stern Kai 7, Frankfurt, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091001,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,2009/10/03 06:00,2010/01/15 06:00,['2009/10/03 06:00'],"['2009/10/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/15 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2009194 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2009.194 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2009 Dec;23(12):2242-7. doi: 10.1038/leu.2009.194.

However, transformation to acute myeloid leukemia is occasionally observed, particularly in patients without a cytogenetic response to lenalidomide. We performed molecular studies in a patient with classical 5q- syndrome with complete erythroid and partial cytogenetic response to lenalidomide, who evolved to high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome with complex karyotype. Immunohistochemistry of pre-treatment marrow biopsies revealed a small fraction of progenitors with overexpression of p53 and sequencing confirmed a TP53 mutation. TP53 mutated subclones have not previously been described in myelodysplastic syndrome with isolated del(5q) and indicates a previously unknown heterogeneity of this disease. The aberrant subclone remained stable during the treatment with lenalidomide and expanded at transformation, suggesting that this pre-existing cell population had molecular features which made it insensitive to lenalidomide and prone to disease progression.","['Jadersten, Martin', 'Saft, Leonie', 'Pellagatti, Andrea', 'Gohring, Gudrun', 'Wainscoat, James S', 'Boultwood, Jacqueline', 'Porwit, Anna', 'Schlegelberger, Brigitte', 'Hellstrom-Lindberg, Eva']","['Jadersten M', 'Saft L', 'Pellagatti A', 'Gohring G', 'Wainscoat JS', 'Boultwood J', 'Porwit A', 'Schlegelberger B', 'Hellstrom-Lindberg E']","['Karolinska Institutet, Department of Medicine, Center for Experimental Hematology, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden. martin.jadersten@ki.se']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091001,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,PMC2791931,2009/10/03 06:00,2010/02/19 06:00,['2009/10/03 06:00'],"['2009/10/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/19 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2009.011528 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2009.011528 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2009 Dec;94(12):1762-6. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2009.011528.

The present study was designed to determine the prevalence of TET2 gene alterations in chronic myelomonocytic leukemias. DESIGN AND METHODS: Blood and bone marrow cells were collected from 88 patients with chronic phase chronic myelomonocytic leukemia and from 14 with acute transformation of a previously identified disease. Polymerase chain reaction analysis and direct sequencing were used to sequence exons 3 to 11 of the TET2 gene. Annotated single nucleotide polymorphisms were excluded. Survival curves were constructed by the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: We detected TET2 mutations in 44 of 88 (50%) patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, which suggests that TET2 gene mutations are especially frequent in this myeloid disease. A TET2 gene alteration was identified in 18 of the 43 patients studied at diagnosis and was associated with a trend to a lower overall survival rate; confining the analysis to the 29 patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia-1, according to the WHO classification, the difference in overall survival between patients with or without TET2 gene mutations became statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: TET2 gene alterations are more frequent in chronic myelomonocytic leukemia than in other subgroups of hematopoietic diseases studied so far and could negatively affect the patients' outcome. The striking association between TET2 gene alterations and monocytosis, already observed in patients with systemic mastocytosis, could indicate a negative role of TET2 in the control of monocytic lineage determination.","['Kosmider, Olivier', 'Gelsi-Boyer, Veronique', 'Ciudad, Marion', 'Racoeur, Cindy', 'Jooste, Valerie', 'Vey, Norbert', 'Quesnel, Bruno', 'Fenaux, Pierre', 'Bastie, Jean-Noel', 'Beyne-Rauzy, Odile', 'Stamatoulas, Aspasia', 'Dreyfus, Francois', 'Ifrah, Norbert', 'de Botton, Stephane', 'Vainchenker, William', 'Bernard, Oliver A', 'Birnbaum, Daniel', 'Fontenay, Michaela', 'Solary, Eric']","['Kosmider O', 'Gelsi-Boyer V', 'Ciudad M', 'Racoeur C', 'Jooste V', 'Vey N', 'Quesnel B', 'Fenaux P', 'Bastie JN', 'Beyne-Rauzy O', 'Stamatoulas A', 'Dreyfus F', 'Ifrah N', 'de Botton S', 'Vainchenker W', 'Bernard OA', 'Birnbaum D', 'Fontenay M', 'Solary E']","['Hematology Department, Hopital Cochin (APHP), Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091001,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,PMC2791942,2009/10/03 06:00,2010/02/19 06:00,['2009/10/03 06:00'],"['2009/10/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/19 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2009.011205 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2009.011205 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2009 Dec;94(12):1676-81. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2009.011205.

Final results of the CSTIBES02 trial.,87-95,10.3324/haematol.2009.011221 [doi],"BACKGROUND: Imatinib, given concurrently or alternating with chemotherapy, has improved the response and survival of patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph(+) ALL) but relapses are still frequent. The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and results of giving imatinib concurrently with intensive chemotherapy, stem cell transplantation and post-transplant imatinib maintenance therapy in patients with newly diagnosed Ph(+) ALL. DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a phase II study of patients with newly diagnosed Ph(+) ALL given standard chemotherapy, together with imatinib (400 mg/day) until stem cell transplantation, followed by imatinib maintenance therapy for all patients regardless of the molecular status of the disease. RESULTS: Of the 30 patients included, 27 (90%) achieved complete remission, one was resistant to treatment and two died during induction therapy. The percentages of major and complete molecular responses were 86% and 21% after induction, and 81% and 65% after consolidation, respectively. Similar results were observed assessing minimal residual disease by flow cytometry. Of the 27 patients who achieved complete remission, 21 underwent stem cell transplantation (16 allogeneic, 5 autologous). Imatinib (400 mg/day) could be administered after transplantation for a median of 3.9 months in 12 patients, although it was interrupted in 10 patients (in 2 cases because of side effects of the drug). Nine patients relapsed, four before and five after stem cell transplantation and eight patients died of transplant-related causes. With a median follow-up of 4.1 years, the probabilities (95% CI) of disease-free and overall survival were 30% (15% to 45%) and 30% (16% to 45%), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: These results confirm that imatinib is an effective first-line treatment for adult Ph(+) ALL when given concurrently with chemotherapy, making stem cell transplantation feasible in a high proportion of patients. However, post-transplantation imatinib administration was limited, mainly because of transplantation-derived complications rather than drug-specific toxicity.","['Ribera, Josep-Maria', 'Oriol, Albert', 'Gonzalez, Marcos', 'Vidriales, Belen', 'Brunet, Salut', 'Esteve, Jordi', 'Del Potro, Eloy', 'Rivas, Concepcion', 'Moreno, Maria-Jose', 'Tormo, Mar', 'Martin-Reina, Victoria', 'Sarra, Josep', 'Parody, Ricardo', 'de Oteyza, Jaime Perez', 'Bureo, Encarna', 'Bernal, Maria-Teresa']","['Ribera JM', 'Oriol A', 'Gonzalez M', 'Vidriales B', 'Brunet S', 'Esteve J', 'Del Potro E', 'Rivas C', 'Moreno MJ', 'Tormo M', 'Martin-Reina V', 'Sarra J', 'Parody R', 'de Oteyza JP', 'Bureo E', 'Bernal MT']","[""Department of Hematology of the Hospitals Institut Catala d'Oncologia-Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol, Badalona, Spain. jribera@iconcologia.net""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091001,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,PMC2805727,2009/10/03 06:00,2011/08/06 06:00,['2009/10/03 06:00'],"['2009/10/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/06 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2009.011221 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2009.011221 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2010 Jan;95(1):87-95. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2009.011221.

The majority of APL patients harbor the t(15:17) translocation leading to expression of the fusion protein promyelocytic-retinoic acid receptor alpha. Treatment with retinoic acid leads to degradation of promyelocytic-retinoic acid receptor alpha protein and disappearance of leukemic cells; however, 30% of APL patients relapse after treatment. One potential mechanism for relapse is the persistence of cancer ""stem"" cells in hematopoietic organs after treatment. Using a novel sorting strategy we developed to isolate murine myeloid cells at distinct stages of differentiation, we identified a population of committed myeloid cells (CD34(+), c-kit(+), FcgammaRIII/II(+), Gr1(int)) that accumulates in the spleen and bone marrow in a murine model of APL. We observed that these cells are capable of efficiently generating leukemia in recipient mice, demonstrating that this population represents the APL cancer-initiating cell. These cells down-regulate the transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer binding protein alpha (C/EBPalpha) possibly through a methylation-dependent mechanism, indicating that C/EBPalpha deregulation contributes to transformation of APL cancer-initiating cells. Our findings provide further understanding of the biology of APL by demonstrating that a committed transformed progenitor can initiate and propagate the disease.","['Guibal, Florence C', 'Alberich-Jorda, Meritxell', 'Hirai, Hideyo', 'Ebralidze, Alexander', 'Levantini, Elena', 'Di Ruscio, Annalisa', 'Zhang, Pu', 'Santana-Lemos, Barbara A', 'Neuberg, Donna', 'Wagers, Amy J', 'Rego, Eduardo M', 'Tenen, Daniel G']","['Guibal FC', 'Alberich-Jorda M', 'Hirai H', 'Ebralidze A', 'Levantini E', 'Di Ruscio A', 'Zhang P', 'Santana-Lemos BA', 'Neuberg D', 'Wagers AJ', 'Rego EM', 'Tenen DG']","['Center for Life Sciences, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091001,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,PMC2798860,2009/10/03 06:00,2010/02/10 06:00,['2009/10/03 06:00'],"['2009/10/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/10 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)38761-9 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2008-10-182071 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2009 Dec 24;114(27):5415-25. doi: 10.1182/blood-2008-10-182071.

The characteristic bleeding diathesis is the most notorious manifestation of the disease, which historically has accounted for a high mortality rate during induction. Acute promyelocytic leukemia is one of the few hematologic diseases that must be recognized under the microscope by the practicing hematologist because early institution of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) at the first suspicion of the disease before confirmation of the diagnosis and aggressive blood product support are critical to reduce early mortality. ATRA plus anthracycline-based chemotherapy for induction and consolidation followed by maintenance ATRA with low-dose chemotherapy is currently the standard of care. However, the combination of ATRA and arsenic trioxide, with minimal chemotherapy to control leukocytosis, is very effective therapy for newly diagnosed patients. This combination may replace conventional approaches for most, if not all, patients in the very near future.

The GIMEMA CML WP (Gruppo Italiano Malattie Ematologiche Adulto Chronic Myeloid Leukemia Working Party) has performed a prospective study to compare CBA and I-FISH for the definition of complete cytogenetic response (CCgR). Samples (n = 664) were evaluated simultaneously by CBA and I-FISH. Of 537 cases in CCgR, the number of positive nuclei by I-FISH was less than 1% in 444 cases (82.7%). Of 451 cases with less than 1% positive nuclei by I-FISH, 444 (98.4%) were classified as CCgR by CBA. The major molecular response rate was significantly greater in cases with I-FISH less than 1% than in those with I-FISH 1% to 5% (66.8% vs 51.6%, P < .001) and in cases with CCgR and I-FISH less than 1% than in cases with CCgR and I-FISH 1% to 5% (66.1% vs 49.4%, P = .004). I-FISH is more sensitive than CBA and can be used to monitor CCgR. With appropriate probes, the cutoff value of I-FISH may be established at 1%.

This study was performed to elucidate the role of the Pbx1 TALE protein in the corneal epithelium of mice. METHODS: Pbx1(f/f) mice were crossed with mice containing Cre recombinase under the control of the K14 promoter. Subsequently, the eyes of these mice were dissected and prepared for histologic or molecular analysis. RESULTS: Tissue-specific deletion of Pbx1 in the corneal epithelium of mice resulted in corneal dystrophy and clouding that was apparent in newborns and progressively worsened with age. Thickening of the cornea epithelium was accompanied by stromal infiltration with atypical basal cells, severe disorganization of stromal collagen matrix, and loss of corneal barrier function. High epithelial cell turnover was associated with perturbed expression of developmental regulators and aberrant differentiation, suggesting an important function for Pbx1 in determining corneal identity. CONCLUSIONS: These studies establish an essential role of the Pbx1 proto-oncogene in corneal morphogenesis.","['Murphy, Mark J', 'Polok, Bozena K', 'Schorderet, Daniel F', 'Cleary, Michael L']","['Murphy MJ', 'Polok BK', 'Schorderet DF', 'Cleary ML']","['Department of Pathology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California 94305, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20090924,United States,Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci,Investigative ophthalmology & visual science,7703701,PMC2821029,2009/10/03 06:00,2010/02/18 06:00,['2009/10/03 06:00'],"['2009/10/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/18 06:00 [medline]']","['iovs.08-3327 [pii]', '10.1167/iovs.08-3327 [doi]']",ppublish,Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci. 2010 Feb;51(2):795-803. doi: 10.1167/iovs.08-3327.

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to quantify its overall benefit in specific clinical scenarios. METHODS: Randomised controlled trials assessing antiviral prophylaxis versus placebo, no treatment, pre-emptive treatment or another antiviral drug were included. Patients undergoing haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) or intensive chemotherapy for acute leukaemia or high-grade lymphoma were included. No restrictions on language, year or publication status were applied. Overall mortality, herpes simplex virus (HSV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV) diseases were assessed as primary outcomes. Pooled relative risks (RRs) and numbers needed to treat (NNT) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) are reported. RESULTS: HSCT was the condition assessed in 22 trials and intensive chemotherapy in 5 trials. In the pre-engraftment setting of autologous or allogeneic HSCT, antiviral prophylaxis (mainly acyclovir for HSV seropositive recipients) significantly reduced HSV (NNT 2, 2-2, control event rate (CER) 61.9%) and CMV disease, with no effect on overall mortality. In the allogeneic post-engraftment setting (mainly CMV-seropositive recipients/donors), antiviral prophylaxis resulted in a significant reduction in overall mortality, RR 0.79 (0.65-0.95), NNT 12 (7-50, CER 39.4%) and all viral-related outcomes. In this setting, acyclovir significantly reduced overall mortality (RR 0.71, 0.53-0.96, 4 trials) and ganciclovir/maribavir significantly reduced CMV disease (RR 0.26, 0.14-0.48, 5 trials). During chemotherapy, acyclovir significantly decreased HSV disease (NNT 3, 2-4, CER 37.4%) and infection rates, with no effect on mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Antiviral prophylaxis reduced mortality with a small NNT in the post-engraftment setting of allogeneic HSCT. In the pre-engraftment phase and during chemotherapy only viral-related morbidity was reduced.","['Yahav, Dafna', 'Gafter-Gvili, Anat', 'Muchtar, Eli', 'Skalsky, Keren', 'Kariv, Galia', 'Yeshurun, Moshe', 'Leibovici, Leonard', 'Paul, Mical']","['Yahav D', 'Gafter-Gvili A', 'Muchtar E', 'Skalsky K', 'Kariv G', 'Yeshurun M', 'Leibovici L', 'Paul M']","['Department of Medicine E, Rabin Medical Center, Beilinson Hospital, Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel-Aviv University, Israel. dafna.yahav@gmail.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",20090930,England,Eur J Cancer,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",9005373,,2009/10/03 06:00,2010/03/30 06:00,['2009/10/03 06:00'],"['2009/05/27 00:00 [received]', '2009/08/05 00:00 [revised]', '2009/08/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/10/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/30 06:00 [medline]']","['S0959-8049(09)00648-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ejca.2009.08.010 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Cancer. 2009 Dec;45(18):3131-48. doi: 10.1016/j.ejca.2009.08.010.

But the precise mechanism of resveratrol involved in leukemia is not well understood. In this study, we examine its anti-leukemia effect both in vitro and in vivo. Our data indicate that resveratrol contributes to inhibiting growth, inducing apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in the three leukemia cell lines (Jurkat, SUP-B15, and Kasumi-1), and reducing the phosphorylation of STAT3, meanwhile modulating the expression of Bcl-2 and Bax. In vivo, resveratrol could prolong the life span of Kasumi-1-bearing mice, and attenuate the activity of STAT3. Taken altogether, this investigation focuses on signaling pathways involved in STAT3 by resveratrol and to delineate its molecular mechanisms underlying anti-leukemia effect.","['Li, Tan', 'Wang, Wei', 'Chen, Hong', 'Li, Tong', 'Ye, Lu']","['Li T', 'Wang W', 'Chen H', 'Li T', 'Ye L']","[""Tianjin Key Laboratory for Biomarkers of Occupational and Environmental Hazard, Medical College of Chinese People's Armed Police Force, Tianjin, PR China. tanli20042001@yahoo.com.cn""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090929,Netherlands,Int Immunopharmacol,International immunopharmacology,100965259,,2009/10/03 06:00,2010/06/15 06:00,['2009/10/03 06:00'],"['2009/05/28 00:00 [received]', '2009/09/13 00:00 [revised]', '2009/09/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/10/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/15 06:00 [medline]']","['S1567-5769(09)00298-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.intimp.2009.09.009 [doi]']",ppublish,Int Immunopharmacol. 2010 Jan;10(1):18-25. doi: 10.1016/j.intimp.2009.09.009.

The first public CB bank was established in 1993 allowing unrelated CB transplantation to become an option for patients lacking a suitable adult donor. Today, the results of CB transplantation are comparable to those of bone marrow transplants with several important advantages: the graft is available 'off the shelf', thereby reducing the waiting time, and the requirements of human lecucoyte antigen (HLA) matching are less restrictive than those of adult sources. The reduced requirement for HLA matching allows transplants between incompletely matched donors and recipients, thus reducing the size of the inventory required at the national level. This also mitigates the disadvantage encountered by persons of rare HLA genotypes or those who do not belong to populations of North Western European descent.

These two cell sources show similar percentages of NK cells, including the major CD56(dim) and CD56(bright) subpopulations. UCB also contains an additional CD56-CD16+ subset, not typically found in PB. In addition, there are a number of progenitor cell populations in UCB that can give rise to NK cells. Some studies showed that UCB NK cells express a relatively higher percentage of inhibitory receptors (CD94/NKG2A and killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptors) and less adhesion molecules. Resting UCB NK cells also show significantly less cytotoxicity compared to PB NK cells. However, following cytokine stimulation, the cytotoxicity of UCB NK cells can be rapidly increased to levels that are comparable to PB NK cells. Activation and expansion protocols for UCB NK cells are briefly reviewed. Lastly, we outline the early use of UCB NK cells in clinical trials.","['Verneris, Michael R', 'Miller, Jeffrey S']","['Verneris MR', 'Miller JS']","['Department of Paediatrics, Division of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA.

The length of telomere repeats is set in the germline but decreases in somatic cells, primarily as a function of DNA replication. Progressive telomere shortening limits stem cell divisions and probably acts as a tumor suppressor mechanism. Using a sensitive PCR method to detect the length of individual telomere repeats on specific chromosomes, we confirmed that telomere length decreases from primitive to more differentiated human cell types within the hematopoietic hierarchy. Genetic mutations in the components of telomerase (the RNA template sequence hTERC, reverse transcriptase hTERT, and Syskerin DKC1) have recently been implicated in a variety of bone marrow failure syndromes, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and more recently, acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The majority of mutations discovered in AML patients were heritable and resulted in partial loss of telomerase activity, a finding counterintuitive to the requirement of telomerase in cancer cells. We have found heritable hypomorphic TERT mutations in other cancers as well, and we propose that such mutations result in short telomeres and premature loss of stem cells. Loss of normal stem cells could provide strong selection for abnormal cells incapable of responding to DNA damage signals originating from short telomeres. Such cells will have a DNA repair defect resulting in genomic instability and a mutator phenotype. Our findings point to an intimate connection between senescence and cancer and highlight the important role of telomeres in the biology of normal and malignant human cells.","['Hills, Mark', 'Lansdorp, Peter M']","['Hills M', 'Lansdorp PM']","['Terry Fox Laboratory, BC Cancer Agency, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Ann N Y Acad Sci,Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,7506858,,2009/10/03 06:00,2009/10/24 06:00,['2009/10/03 06:00'],"['2009/10/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/24 06:00 [medline]']","['NYAS4565 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1749-6632.2009.04565.x [doi]']",ppublish,Ann N Y Acad Sci. 2009 Sep;1176:178-90. doi: 10.1111/j.1749-6632.2009.04565.x.,,IM,"['Base Sequence', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Mutation', 'Stem Cells/enzymology', 'Telomerase/*genetics', 'Telomere/*enzymology/*genetics']",,"['EC 2.7.7.49 (TERT protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)']",,,,,['Ann N Y Acad Sci. 2009 Oct;1179:235'],,,,,,,,,,,

We report here a case of cerebral aspergillosis in a 34-years-old man with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia who was successfully treated with a combination of aggressive neurosurgery, intracavitary instillation of amphotericin B and voriconazole. We aimed to emphazise the roles of surgery, intracavitary therapy and antifungal therapy in the management of neuroaspergillosis. Under amphotericin-B therapy, the patient developed dysarthria and paralysis of the right side of his body. Brain magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a lesion in the left parieto-occipital region, measuring 7 cm in the greatest dimension. Diagnostic surgery was interrupted due to abundant bleeding. The culture of the aspirate from the lesion yielded Aspergillus flavus. The therapy was switched to voriconazole and caspofungin combination. Due to disease progression during combination therapy, the patient had a second surgical resection resulting in a 75% reduction in lesion size. Following surgical intervention, intracavitary instillation of amphotericin B (0.3 mg/day for 15 days) was performed alongside with combination therapy (voriconazole and caspofungin). Caspofungin was stopped after 42 days, whereas the patient was continued on voriconazole for a total of 100 days. At this point, his brain lesion resolved almost completely. However, leukemia relapsed. The patient died during his treatment course because of neutropenic typhilitis occurring in the aplastic phase. It is stated that in patients with neuroaspergillosis radical neurosurgery leads to better outcomes if performed at an earlier stage. Antifungal treatment of cerebral aspergillosis requires that the drug must cross the blood brain barrier. Voriconazole has the ability to cross the blood brain barrier. The therapy should be prolonged beyond the resolution of all lesions and until reversal of the underlying predisposition. We conclude that the use of neurosurgery and voriconazole together appears to be a reliable and effective treatment modality in patients with cerebral aspergillosis.","['Ozcelik, Tulay', 'Ozkalemkas, Fahir', 'Kocaeli, Hasan', 'Altundal, Yildiz', 'Ener, Beyza', 'Ali, Ridvan', 'Ozkocaman, Vildan', 'Hakyemez, Bahattin', 'Tunali, Ahmet']","['Ozcelik T', 'Ozkalemkas F', 'Kocaeli H', 'Altundal Y', 'Ener B', 'Ali R', 'Ozkocaman V', 'Hakyemez B', 'Tunali A']","['Uludag Universitesi Tip Fakultesi, Ic Hastaliklari Anabilim Dali, Hematoloji Bilim Dali, Bursa. tulay.ozcelik@hotmail.com']",['tur'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,Turkey,Mikrobiyol Bul,Mikrobiyoloji bulteni,7503830,,2009/10/03 06:00,2010/06/09 06:00,['2009/10/03 06:00'],"['2009/10/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/09 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Mikrobiyol Bul. 2009 Jul;43(3):499-506.,3,IM,"['Adult', 'Amphotericin B/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Antifungal Agents/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Aspergillus flavus/drug effects/*isolation & purification', 'Caspofungin', 'Chemotherapy, Adjuvant', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Echinocandins/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Humans', 'Injections, Intraventricular', 'Lipopeptides', 'Male', 'Neuroaspergillosis/*drug therapy/*surgery', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications', 'Pyrimidines/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Triazoles/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Voriconazole']",,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Echinocandins)', '0 (Lipopeptides)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Triazoles)', '7XU7A7DROE (Amphotericin B)', 'F0XDI6ZL63 (Caspofungin)', 'JFU09I87TR (Voriconazole)']",,"Akut lenfoblastik losemili bir olguda gelisen noroaspergillozun basarili tedavisi: cerrahi, sistemik antifungal tedavi ve intrakaviter tedavinin rolleri.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It causes infections in elderly, immunocompromised patients, patients with chronic disorders or premature infants. In this report, a case of A. xylosoxidans bacteremia that developed in a child with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) was presented. Four-years-old male patient under ALL induction therapy was admitted with symptoms of lethargy, headache, somnolence, and fever (39 degrees C). Cerebrospinal fluid, blood, throat and urine cultures were taken from the patient and empirical treatment with sulbactam cefoperazon and amikacin was initiated. Blood cultures in BacT Alert 3D (Bio Merieux, France) revealed the growth of a gram-negative coccobacillus. The agent which was non-fermentative, indol and H2S negative, was identified as A. xylosoxidans by API 20 NE (Bio Merieux, France). Since fever continued under the current antibiotic treatment, the therapy was switched to imipenem (90 mg/kg 3x/day) and the patient's condition improved markedly after 24 hours. Disc diffusion susceptibility testing of the isolate revealed that it was resistant to ampicillin, cephalothin, cefuroxime, cefoxitin, cefotaxime, amikacin, netilmicin and gentamicin; susceptible to amoxicillin clavulanate, piperacillin tazobactam, seftazidime, cefepime, imipenem and ciprofloxacin. Following 14 days of imipenem therapy, the patient recovered and discharged from the hospital on routine follow-up.

METHODS: The authors investigated whether treatment with hypomethylating agents (5-azacytidine/decitabine) leads to an improved outcome. Between January 2004 and December 2007, 81 patients (37 [46%] with AML [>or=20% blasts]; 44 [54%] with high-risk MDS) with chromosome 5 and 7 abnormalities were treated with hypomethylating agents as their initial therapy. These included 68 patients with complex (>or=3) abnormalities and 13 with <3 aberrations. During the same period, 151 patients (126 with AML, 25 with MDS) with chromosome 5 and 7 abnormalities (128 complex, 23 noncomplex) were treated with intensive chemotherapy (including cytarabine-based regimens in 72% and other regimes in 28%). RESULTS: The median ages for the 2 groups were 66 years and 61 years, respectively (ranges, 37-85 years and 19-89 years). Thirty-three (41%) patients in the hypomethylating group achieved complete remission (CR) versus 53 (35%) in the chemotherapy group (P=.395). With a median follow-up of 51 weeks (range, 12-101 weeks) and 40 weeks (range, 5-128 weeks), 22 of 33 patients in the hypomethylating group and 33 of 53 patients in the chemotherapy group had developed disease recurrence. The median CR duration was 45 weeks and 23 weeks, respectively (P=.153). The overall survival was superior for the hypomethylating group compared with the chemotherapy group (P=.019). CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with hypomethylating agents may be superior to chemotherapy in patients with chromosome 5 and 7 abnormalities.","['Ravandi, Farhad', 'Issa, Jean-Pierre', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', ""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Pierce, Sherry', 'Shan, Jianqin', 'Borthakur, Gautam', 'Verstovsek, Srdan', 'Faderl, Stefan', 'Cortes, Jorge', 'Kantarjian, Hagop']","['Ravandi F', 'Issa JP', 'Garcia-Manero G', ""O'Brien S"", 'Pierce S', 'Shan J', 'Borthakur G', 'Verstovsek S', 'Faderl S', 'Cortes J', 'Kantarjian H']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.

Few studies on childhood cancers have been published on the factors that influence the time it takes for patients to get a first medical consultation (patient delay) and treatment (health care system [HCS] delay) once cancer symptoms have been recognized. Our objective was to assess factors related to disease, patient and HCS on patient and HCS delay for children and adolescents with leukemias and lymphomas in Canada. A prospective cohort study was conducted on subjects enrolled in the Treatment and Outcomes Surveillance program of the Canadian Childhood Cancer Surveillance and Control Program, a national surveillance program. We studied 963 leukemia and 397 lymphoma patients who were less than 19-years old at diagnosis in 1995-2000. Logistic regression models were used to measure the associations between candidate predictive factors and delays. Age was positively associated with patient delay for both leukemia and lymphoma patients, but not with HCS delay. Patients first seen in a hospital emergency room had a lower risk of HCS delay than patients first seen by a general practitioner.

Despite their well-documented long-term side effects, including a cumulative dose-dependent cardiotoxicity and an increase in the incidence of secondary leukemia, anthracyclines remain an integral component of many adjuvant regimens for breast cancer. The utility of HER-2/TOP2A coamplification in predicting sensitivity to anthracycline chemotherapy has been widely suggested but requires substantiation. The recent maturation of two large phase III trials that directly examined the substitution of a taxane for an anthracycline in the adjuvant setting provides further data to critically evaluate the standard use of anthracyclines in the treatment of early-stage breast cancer. Results from both US Oncology 9735 and BCIRG 006 demonstrated equivalent efficacies in taxane- and anthracycline comparator arms. However, in both trials, the taxane-based regimen(s) resulted in less relative toxicity than the anthracycline-based regimen(s). These trial results pose legitimate questions regarding the future application of anthracyclines in the adjuvant breast cancer setting.","['Pal, Sumanta K', 'Childs, Barrett H', 'Pegram, Mark']","['Pal SK', 'Childs BH', 'Pegram M']","['Department of Medical Oncology & Experimental Therapeutics, City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center, Duarte, CA 91010, USA. spal@coh.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,Netherlands,Breast Cancer Res Treat,Breast cancer research and treatment,8111104,,2009/10/02 06:00,2010/02/23 06:00,['2009/10/02 06:00'],"['2009/09/11 00:00 [received]', '2009/09/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/10/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10549-009-0567-y [doi]'],ppublish,Breast Cancer Res Treat. 2010 Jan;119(1):25-32. doi: 10.1007/s10549-009-0567-y.,1,IM,"['Aged', 'Anthracyclines/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Breast Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Chemotherapy, Adjuvant/*methods', 'Clinical Trials, Phase III as Topic', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Heart/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/chemically induced', 'Middle Aged', 'Taxoids/therapeutic use']",55,"['0 (Anthracyclines)', '0 (Taxoids)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Stem cell sources included bone marrow in 38, peripheral blood in 4, and cord blood (CB) in 14. Four patients died before engraftment and 52 engrafted. Twenty patients developed grade II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and 8 developed extensive chronic GVHD. With median follow-up of 39.1 months, event free survival and overall survival were 60.4% and 67.5%, respectively, at 5 yr. Events included relapse in 10 and treatment-related mortality (TRM) in 10. The causes of TRM included sepsis in 4, GVHD in 4 (1 acute GVHD and 3 chronic GVHD), veno-occlusive disease in 1 and fulminant hepatitis in 1. Patients transplanted with CB had event free survival of 57.1%, comparable to 63.2% for those transplanted with other than CB.

Our recent studies have shown that one important mechanism of HTLV-I-Mediated tumorigenesis is through PDZ-LIM domain-containing protein 2 (PDLIM2) repression, although the involved mechanism remains unknown. Here, we further report that HTLV-I-Mediated PDLIM2 repression was a pathophysiological event and the PDLIM2 repression involved DNA methylation. Whereas DNA methyltransferases 1 and 3b but not 3a were upregulated in HTLV-I-transformed T cells, the hypomethylating agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC) restored PDLIM2 expression and induced death of these malignant cells. Notably, the PDLIM2 repression was independent of the viral regulatory protein Tax because neither short-term induction nor long-term stable expression of Tax could downregulate PDLIM2 expression. These studies provide important insights into PDLIM2 regulation, HTLV-I leukemogenicity, long latency, and cancer health disparities. Given the efficient antitumor activity with no obvious toxicity of 5-aza-dC, these studies also suggest potential therapeutic strategies for ATL.","['Yan, Pengrong', 'Qu, Zhaoxia', 'Ishikawa, Chie', 'Mori, Naoki', 'Xiao, Gutian']","['Yan P', 'Qu Z', 'Ishikawa C', 'Mori N', 'Xiao G']","['University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Pittsburgh, PA 15213, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Neoplasia,"Neoplasia (New York, N.Y.)",100886622,PMC2745669,2009/10/02 06:00,2010/01/16 06:00,['2009/10/02 06:00'],"['2009/05/11 00:00 [received]', '2009/06/15 00:00 [revised]', '2009/06/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/10/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1593/neo.09752 [doi]'],ppublish,Neoplasia. 2009 Oct;11(10):1036-41. doi: 10.1593/neo.09752.,10,IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Azacitidine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Cells, Cultured', '*DNA Methylation', 'Decitabine', 'Gene Products, tax/genetics/*metabolism', 'Host-Pathogen Interactions', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/*metabolism/physiology', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'LIM Domain Proteins', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Microfilament Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism/pathology/virology']",,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (LIM Domain Proteins)', '0 (Microfilament Proteins)', '0 (PDLIM2 protein, human)', '0 (tax protein, Human T-lymphotrophic virus 1)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",,,['R01 CA116616/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

On the other hand, several types of cancers express Fas ligand (FasL) and/or TRAIL and mediate apoptosis of T cells in vitro. The ""counter-attack"" machinery may account for the mechanisms by which tumors evade host immune surveillance. In this study we determined if COX2 inhibitor could modulate effector molecules of cell death on colon cancer cells changing their effects on cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Colon adenocarcinoma cells, HCA7 and HCT116, the former COX2-positive and the latter COX2-negative, were pre-incubated with/without a COX2 inhibitor, NS398. Subsequently, the cells were co-cultured with Jurkat T cell leukemia cells and damage to Jurkat cells was determined. Treatment with NS398 resulted in reduction of expression of FasL and TRAIL in HCA7 cells, whereas NS398 did not affect the expression of FasL and TRAIL in HCT116 cells. The number of viable Jurkat cells was diminished when cells were co-cultured with naive, non-pretreated HCA7 or HCA116 cells. Preincubation of HCA7 cells with NS398 before co-culture blunted the HCA7 cell-induced cell toxicity on Jurkat cells. In contrast, pretreatment with NS398 failed to inhibit the HCT116-induced Jurkat cell killing. Our results suggest that COX2 regulates the expression of FasL and TRAIL on COX2-positive colon cancer cells thereby evoking a counter-attack against cytotoxic T cells, which may lead to compromised host immune responses.","['Wang, Quanxin', 'Takei, Yoshiyuki', 'Kobayashi, Osamu', 'Osada, Taro', 'Watanabe, Sumio']","['Wang Q', 'Takei Y', 'Kobayashi O', 'Osada T', 'Watanabe S']","['Department of Gastroenterology, Juntendo University School of Medicine, 2-1-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8421, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20090828,Japan,J Clin Biochem Nutr,Journal of clinical biochemistry and nutrition,8700907,PMC2735628,2009/10/02 06:00,2009/10/02 06:01,['2009/10/02 06:00'],"['2009/02/10 00:00 [received]', '2009/02/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/10/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/02 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3164/jcbn.09-21 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Biochem Nutr. 2009 Sep;45(2):163-70. doi: 10.3164/jcbn.09-21.

Specifically, randomized phase III designs focus on improvements that are more significant statistically than medically and put an emphasis on avoiding a false positive result that is more appropriate for diseases that are curable, in contrast to acute leukemias. The resultant large sample sizes needed for each treatment restrict the trial to one or two new treatments, although historical reality suggests the difficulty in knowing, without clinical data, whether these are the best of several new treatments. The p value-based statistics discourage use of data from previous patients in the trial to inform treatment of subsequent patients, contravening patients' assumptions. Standard phase II trials focus on a single outcome, ignoring the complexity of medical practice, and ignore prognostic heterogeneity. Finally, although patients are more interested in whether a new treatment is better than another, rather than whether it is active, randomization between different treatments does not begin until phase II trials have been completed. This paper proposes alternatives based on the Bayesian statistical approach. The thesis that I will develop here is that commonly used clinical trial designs are unrealistic in the sense that they do not correspond well to patients' views of medical practice and greatly over-simplify such practice. By emphasizing Bayesian rather than p value-based statistics and focusing on acute myeloid leukemia, I hope to familiarize physicians with some of the many new published designs that address these problems.","['Estey, Elihu']",['Estey E'],"['Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, WA, USA. eestey@u.washington.edu']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,PMC2754960,2009/10/02 06:00,2011/08/05 06:00,['2009/10/02 06:00'],"['2009/10/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/05 06:00 [medline]']","['94/10/1435 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2009.011411 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2009 Oct;94(10):1435-9. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2009.011411.,10,IM,"['Bayes Theorem', 'Clinical Trials as Topic/*methods', 'Clinical Trials, Phase III as Topic/methods', 'Humans', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic/methods', '*Research Design/standards']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Current treatment options favor chronic immunosuppression. Alemtuzumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against glycophosphatidylinositol-anchored CD52, is approved for patients refractory to therapy in other lymphoid malignancies. DESIGN AND METHODS: We retrospectively examined treatment outcomes in 59 patients with CD8+ T-cell large granular lymphocytic leukemia, 41 of whom required therapy. Eight patients with severe refractory cytopenia despite multiple treatment regimens had been treated with subcutaneous alemtuzumab as salvage therapy. Flow cytometry was used to monitor expression of glycophosphatidylinositol-anchored CD52, CD55, and CD59 as well as to characterize T-cell clonal expansions by T-cell receptor variable beta-chain (Vbeta) repertoire. RESULTS: Analysis of the effects of alemtuzumab revealed remissions with restoration of platelets in one of one patient, red blood cell transfusion independence in three of five patients and improvement of neutropenia in one of three, resulting in an overall response rate of 50% (4/8 patients). Clonal large granular lymphocytes exhibited decreased CD52 expression post-therapy in patients refractory to treatment. Samples of large granular lymphocytes collected prior to therapy also unexpectedly had a significant proportion of CD52-negative cells while a healthy control population had no such CD52 deficiency (p=0.026). CONCLUSIONS: While alemtuzumab may be highly effective in large granular lymphocytic leukemia, prospective serial monitoring for the presence of CD52-deficient clonal cytotoxic T-lymphocytes should be a component of clinical trials investigating the efficacy of this drug. CD52 deficiency may explain lack of response to alemtuzumab, and such therapy may confer a survival advantage to glycophosphatidylinositol-negative clonal cytotoxic T-lymphocytes.","['Mohan, Sanjay R', 'Clemente, Michael J', 'Afable, Manuel', 'Cazzolli, Heather N', 'Bejanyan, Nelli', 'Wlodarski, Marcin W', 'Lichtin, Alan E', 'Maciejewski, Jaroslaw P']","['Mohan SR', 'Clemente MJ', 'Afable M', 'Cazzolli HN', 'Bejanyan N', 'Wlodarski MW', 'Lichtin AE', 'Maciejewski JP']","['Department of Translational Hematology and Oncology Research, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH 44195, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,PMC2754957,2009/10/02 06:00,2011/08/05 06:00,['2009/10/02 06:00'],"['2009/10/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/05 06:00 [medline]']","['94/10/1407 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2009.009191 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2009 Oct;94(10):1407-14. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2009.009191.,10,IM,"['Aged', 'Alemtuzumab', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/*therapeutic use', 'Antigens, CD/*biosynthesis', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*biosynthesis', 'CD52 Antigen', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/metabolism', 'Clone Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Glycoproteins/*biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Large Granular Lymphocytic/*blood/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/drug effects/*metabolism']",,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (CD52 Antigen)', '0 (CD52 protein, human)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '3A189DH42V (Alemtuzumab)']",,,"['R01 CA113972/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U54 RR019397/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'U54 RR 019397/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",['Haematologica. 2009 Oct;94(10):1341-5.

However, the results of studies on the prognostic significance of NOTCH1 mutations in adult T-lymphoblastic leukemia remain controversial. DESIGN AND METHODS: Here we have investigated the prognostic impact of mutations in the NOTCH1 pathway, in particular, the NOTCH1 and FBXW7 genes, in a large cohort of adult patients with T-lymphoblastic leukemia (n=126). We determined the occurrence of mutations in NOTCH1 and FBXW7 by DNA amplification and direct sequencing of polymerase chain reaction products. RESULTS: Mutations were identified in 57% and 12% of the NOTCH1 and FBXW7 genes, respectively. The characteristics of patients carrying NOTCH1 and/or FBXW7 (NOTCH1-FBXW7) mutations were similar to those with wild-type genes. Patients with NOTCH1-FBXW7 mutations more often showed a thymic immunophenotype (p=0.001). In the overall cohort, no significant differences were seen in the complete remission or event-free survival rates between patients with mutated or wild-type NOTCH1-FBXW7 (p=0.39). CONCLUSIONS: NOTCH1 and FBXW7 mutations were not predictive of outcome in the overall cohort of adult patients with T-lymphoblastic leukemia, but there was a trend towards a favorable prognostic impact of NOTCH1-FBXW7 mutations in the small subgroup of patients with low-risk ERG/BAALC expression status. Our findings further confirm the high frequency of NOTCH1 mutations in adult T-lymphoblastic leukemia.","['Baldus, Claudia D', 'Thibaut, Julia', 'Goekbuget, Nicola', 'Stroux, Andrea', 'Schlee, Cornelia', 'Mossner, Max', 'Burmeister, Thomas', 'Schwartz, Stefan', 'Bloomfield, Clara D', 'Hoelzer, Dieter', 'Thiel, Eckhard', 'Hofmann, Wolf-Karsten']","['Baldus CD', 'Thibaut J', 'Goekbuget N', 'Stroux A', 'Schlee C', 'Mossner M', 'Burmeister T', 'Schwartz S', 'Bloomfield CD', 'Hoelzer D', 'Thiel E', 'Hofmann WK']","['Charite, University Hospital Berlin, Campus Benjamin Franklin, Department of Hematology and Oncology, Hindenburgdamm 30 12203 Berlin, Germany. claudia.baldus@charite.de']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,PMC2754954,2009/10/02 06:00,2011/08/05 06:00,['2009/10/02 06:00'],"['2009/10/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/05 06:00 [medline]']","['94/10/1383 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2008.005272 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2009 Oct;94(10):1383-90. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2008.005272.,10,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/*genetics', 'Cohort Studies', 'F-Box Proteins/*genetics', 'F-Box-WD Repeat-Containing Protein 7', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/*genetics/mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Receptor, Notch1/*genetics', 'Survival Rate/trends', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/*genetics', 'Young Adult']",,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (F-Box Proteins)', '0 (F-Box-WD Repeat-Containing Protein 7)', '0 (FBXW7 protein, human)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)']",,,,['Haematologica. 2009 Oct;94(10):1338-40.

DESIGN AND METHODS: Patients with relapsed or untreated acute myeloid leukemia who were not candidates for chemotherapy entered one of the two treatment arms. In both arms a total dose of 8400 mg of vorinostat was delivered in each 21-day cycle of treatment: in arm A the dose regimen was 400 mg daily whereas in arm B the dose regimen was 200 mg three times daily for 14 days followed by 1 week rest. RESULTS: Data from all 37 patients were used for the analyses. In arm A (n=15), the confirmed complete remission rate was 0% (95% CI, 0% to 23%); this arm was closed at the planned interim analysis. In arm B (n=22), the confirmed complete remission rate was 4.5% (1 response; 95% CI, 0.4% to 24%), with a duration of response exceeding 398 days. The median time to treatment failure in arm A was 42 days (95% CI, 26 to 57); although a minimum of four cycles of treatment were planned, 11 patients (79%) received no more than two cycles. The median time to treatment failure in arm B was 46 days (95% CI, 20 to 71); 13 patients (59%) received no more than two cycles of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Vorinostat monotherapy demonstrated minimal activity in this group of patients with acute myeloid leukemia. Therapy was discontinued in many patients before the planned four cycles had been administered, either because of failure of vorinostat to control the leukocyte count or patients' and physicians' preference. Future studies of vorinostat in acute myeloid leukemia should focus on combinations with other drugs with which it might interact pharmacodynamically.

Although these bodies coordinate important nuclear processes, little is known about how they are formed. Among the most intensively studied bodies in recent years is the PML body. These bodies have been implicated in gene regulation and other cellular processes and are disrupted in cells from patients suffering from acute promyelocytic leukemia. Using live cell imaging microscopy and immunofluorescence, we show in several cell types that PML bodies are formed at telomeric DNA during interphase. Recent studies revealed that both SUMO modification sites and SUMO interaction motifs in the promyelocytic leukemia (PML) protein are required for PML body formation. We show that SMC5, a component of the SUMO ligase MMS21-containing SMC5/6 complex, localizes temporarily at telomeric DNA during PML body formation, suggesting a possible role for SUMO in the formation of PML bodies at telomeric DNA.

FeLV infection causes an important suppression of neutrophil function, leading to opportunistic infections. Recently, a new microbicidal mechanism named NETosis was described in human, bovine and fish neutrophils, as well as in chicken heterophils. The purpose of the present study was to characterize NETosis in feline neutrophils, as well as to evaluate neutrophil function in FeLV naturally infected symptomatic and asymptomatic cats through the phagocytosis process, release of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity. The results showed that feline neutrophils stimulated with protozoa parasites released structures comprising DNA and histones, which were characterized as NETs by immunofluorescence. Quantification of NETs after neutrophil stimulation showed a significant increase in NET release by neutrophils from FeLV(-) and FeLV(+) asymptomatic cats compared with FeLV(+) symptomatic cats. Moreover, the number of released NETs and MPO activity in unstimulated neutrophils of FeLV(+) symptomatic cats were higher than those in unstimulated neutrophils from FeLV(-) and FeLV(+) asymptomatic cats. This study reports, for the first time, NET release by feline neutrophils, along with the fact that NET induction may be modulated by a viral infection.

However, resistance to imatinib has become a clinically significant issue, limiting its long-term efficacy. Numerous mechanisms have been associated with imatinib resistance, including mutations to the BCR-ABL gene, increased production of BCR-ABL, and activation of BCR-ABL-independent pathways (e.g., SRC-family kinases [SFKs]). Resistance to imatinib has driven the development of second-line therapies, such as dasatinib, a dual BCR-ABL/SFK inhibitor more potent than imatinib at targeting BCR-ABL. Dasatinib is approved for the treatment of patients with imatinib-resistant and -intolerant CML and Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Nilotinib, an analog of imatinib, more potent than its parent compound, is another approved agent for patients with imatinib-resistant or -intolerant CML in the chronic or accelerated phase. Nurses must be aware of what constitutes a requirement for treatment change and the mechanisms of resistance that inform the choice of second-line agents. Oncology nurses also must ensure that patients have been educated appropriately to understand imatinib resistance and second-line treatment options.

Acute lymphoblastic leukemia-type chemotherapeutic regimens were more efficient in controlling the disease. Immunophenotyping of typical BPDCN cases revealed CD4(+), CD56(+), HLA-DR(+) and CD123(bright) neoplastic cells, in the absence of major B-, T- and myeloid-associated markers, while the phenotype of the four cases characterized as LAL highlights the risk of misdiagnosis.

Different BM levels of Regulatory T cells (Treg) identified two sub-groups in these patients; only the sub-group with lower Treg percentage showed BM recruitment of CD8 lymphocytes. Different levels of CD54 on BM CD8 cells revealed two sub-groups of Intermediate-1 (Int-1) patients. The sub-group with higher CD54 expression on BM CD8 showed high levels of this molecule also on CD4 cells. BM recruitment of CD8 lymphocytes in the low risk group and/or the presence of high CD54 expression on BM CD8 in Int-1 patients were associated with more pronounced dyserythropoiesis and erythropoietin treatment.

CBC results included normocytic normochromic anemia, marked thrombocytopenia, and low numbers of neoplastic cells that frequently had cytoplasmic projections or blebs. A bone marrow aspirate contained about 80% neoplastic megakaryoblasts with the same microscopic features as those observed in peripheral blood.

The accuracy of DI measurement is important for treatment stratification: hyperdiploidy with DI > or = 1.16 is predictive of favorable prognosis whereas hypodiploidy is associated with poor prognosis. The aim of this study was to validate the accuracy of the DI measured by flow cytometry (FCM) by comparison with the karyotype. From samples of 112 childhood ALL, we created a formula to calculate a theoretical DNA index (tDI) based on the blast cell karyotype, taking into account the additional or missing chromosome material of the major clone. FCM DI correlated with tDI calculated from karyotype (R = 0.987) and with modal chromosome number (DI = 0.0202 x Modal NB + 0.0675 and R = 0.984). In three cases a hypodiploid blast cell population was detected by FCM, while only the duplicated clone was identified by the karyotype. The strong correlation between tDI and DI validates the accuracy of FCM quantification, which is technically fast on fresh or frozen samples. If the karyotype is essential to analyze chromosomal abnormalities, FCM provides complementary information in aneuploid ALLs, either by confirming the cytogenetic data or by detecting additional clones not identified when only using cytogenetic data.","['Rachieru-Sourisseau, P', 'Baranger, L', 'Dastugue, N', 'Robert, A', 'Genevieve, F', 'Kuhlein, E', 'Chassevent, A']","['Rachieru-Sourisseau P', 'Baranger L', 'Dastugue N', 'Robert A', 'Genevieve F', 'Kuhlein E', 'Chassevent A']","[""Unite d'Hematologie-Immunologie-Oncologie, Pole Enfant, CHU Angers, France.

Recent donor-versus-no-donor comparisons in the allogeneic transplant setting highlight a potent graft-versus-leukemia effect in ALL, and the application of reduced intensity conditioning transplants may exploit this effect while reducing nonrelapse mortality. New therapeutic targets, such as CD22 in precusor B-cell ALL and mutations in NOTCH1 in T-cell ALL, are being exploited in clinical trials.

Occupational and environmental exposures to formaldehyde may be associated with an increased risk of leukemia in exposed individuals. However, risk assessment of formaldehyde and leukemia has been challenging due to inconsistencies in human and animal studies and the lack of a known mechanism for leukemia induction. Here, we provide a summary of the symposium at the Environmental Mutagen Society Meeting in 2008, which focused on the epidemiology of formaldehyde and leukemia, potential mechanisms, and implication for risk assessment, with emphasis on future directions in multidisciplinary formaldehyde research. Updated results of two of the three largest industrial cohort studies of formaldehyde-exposed workers have shown positive associations with leukemia, particularly myeloid leukemia, and a recent meta-analysis of studies to date supports this association. Recent mechanistic studies have shown the formation of formaldehyde-induced DNA adducts and characterized the essential DNA repair pathways that mitigate formaldehyde toxicity. The implications of the updated findings for the design of future studies to more effectively assess the risk of leukemia arising from formaldehyde exposure were discussed and specific recommendations were made. A toxicogenomic approach in experimental models and human exposure studies, together with the measurement of biomarkers of internal exposure, such as formaldehyde-DNA and protein adducts, should prove fruitful. It was recognized that increased communication among scientists who perform epidemiology, toxicology, biology, and risk assessment could enhance the design of future studies, which could ultimately reduce uncertainty in the risk assessment of formaldehyde and leukemia.","['Zhang, Luoping', 'Freeman, Laura E Beane', 'Nakamura, Jun', 'Hecht, Stephen S', 'Vandenberg, John J', 'Smith, Martyn T', 'Sonawane, Babasaheb R']","['Zhang L', 'Freeman LE', 'Nakamura J', 'Hecht SS', 'Vandenberg JJ', 'Smith MT', 'Sonawane BR']","['School of Public Health, University of California, Berkeley, California 94720-7356, USA. luoping@berkeley.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', 'Review']",,United States,Environ Mol Mutagen,Environmental and molecular mutagenesis,8800109,PMC2839060,2009/10/01 06:00,2010/04/02 06:00,['2009/10/01 06:00'],"['2009/10/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/em.20534 [doi]'],ppublish,Environ Mol Mutagen. 2010 Apr;51(3):181-91. doi: 10.1002/em.20534.,3,IM,"['DNA Adducts/metabolism', 'Environmental Exposure/statistics & numerical data', 'Environmental Pollutants/*toxicity', 'Formaldehyde/*toxicity', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology/genetics', 'Mutagens/*toxicity', 'Occupational Exposure/statistics & numerical data', 'Risk Assessment/methods']",79,"['0 (DNA Adducts)', '0 (Environmental Pollutants)', '0 (Mutagens)', '1HG84L3525 (Formaldehyde)']","['Published 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,"['R01 ES017452/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 ES017452-01/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States']",,,['NIHMS158490'],,,,,,,,,,

While life expectancy may not be significantly shortened, arterial and venous thrombosis constitute the major causes of morbidity and mortality, together with disease evolution to myelofibrosis or transformation to acute leukemia. Therapy is currently aimed at reducing the rate of thrombosis without increasing the risk of hematologic transformation by inappropriate exposure to cytotoxic drugs. Nevertheless, the mechanism(s) finally responsible for the increased thrombotic tendency have not been clearly elucidated, although risk factors for thrombosis have been identified, and are currently employed for stratifying patients to the most appropriate therapeutic options. Abnormalities of blood cells, activation of neutrophils and platelets, and a hypercoagulability state, can all act in conjunction to lead to thrombosis. Intriguing data also point to the JAK2V617F mutation as both a marker and a mechanism for thrombosis. Better knowledge in the pathophysiology of these disorders, and the introduction of molecularly targeted drugs in clinical trials, anticipate the possibility of more specific and efficacious treatment of classic MPN, particularly as concerns the reduction of risk associated with vascular events.","['Vannucchi, Alessandro M']",['Vannucchi AM'],"['Unita Funzionale di Ematologia, Dipartimento di Area Critica, Universita degli Studi, Florence, Italy. amvannucchi@unifi.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20090930,Italy,Intern Emerg Med,Internal and emergency medicine,101263418,,2009/10/01 06:00,2010/09/15 06:00,['2009/10/01 06:00'],"['2009/07/07 00:00 [received]', '2009/09/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/10/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11739-009-0319-3 [doi]'],ppublish,Intern Emerg Med. 2010 Jun;5(3):177-84. doi: 10.1007/s11739-009-0319-3.

Two key enzymes that were described as affecting PpIX accumulation during ALA treatment are porphobilinogen deaminase (PBGD) and ferrochelatase. Here, we show that down regulation of ALA dehydratase (ALAD) expression and activity by specific shRNA induced a marked decrease in PpIX synthesis in K562 erythroleukemic cells. Photo-inactivation efficacy following ALA-PDT was directly correlated with ALAD-silencing and cellular levels of PpIX. MTT metabolism following ALA-PDT was shown to be 60% higher in ALAD-silenced cells in comparison to control cells, indicating that mitochondria were protected in the silenced cells. Morphological analysis by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of cells treated by ALA-PDT showed no morphological changes in ALAD-silenced cells, in contrast to controls exhibiting cell deformations and lysis. Membrane integrity following ALA-PDT was kept intact and undamaged in ALAD-silenced cells as examined by Annexin V-FITC/PI staining and LDH-L leakage. We conclude that ALAD, although it is present in the cell at abundant levels, has a major and limiting role in regulating PpIX synthesis and ALA-PDT outcome.","['Feuerstein, Tamar', 'Schauder, Avital', 'Malik, Zvi']","['Feuerstein T', 'Schauder A', 'Malik Z']","['Microscopy Unit, Faculty of Life Sciences, Bar-Ilan University, Ramat-Gan, 52900, Israel.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20090817,England,Photochem Photobiol Sci,Photochemical & photobiological sciences : Official journal of the European Photochemistry Association and the European Society for Photobiology,101124451,,2009/10/01 06:00,2010/02/18 06:00,['2009/10/01 06:00'],"['2009/10/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1039/b9pp00007k [doi]'],ppublish,Photochem Photobiol Sci. 2009 Oct;8(10):1461-6. doi: 10.1039/b9pp00007k.

TNF signals through the TNF receptors (TNFR), which also bind soluble lymphotoxin (LTalpha3), a TNF family member with a previously unexamined role in GVHD pathogenesis. We have used preclinical models to investigate the role of LT in GVHD. We confirm that grafts deficient in LTalpha have an attenuated capacity to induce GVHD equal to that seen when grafts lack TNF. This is not associated with other defects in cytokine production or T-cell function, suggesting that LTalpha3 exerts its pathogenic activity directly via TNFR signaling. We confirm that donor-derived LTalpha is required for graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effects, with equal impairment in leukemic clearance seen in recipients of LTalpha- and TNF-deficient grafts. Further impairment in tumor clearance was seen using Tnf/Lta(-/-) donors, suggesting that these molecules play nonredundant roles in GVL. Importantly, donor TNF/LTalpha were only required for GVL where the recipient leukemia was susceptible to apoptosis via p55 TNFR signaling. These data suggest that antagonists neutralizing both TNF and LTalpha3 may be effective for treatment of GVHD, particularly if residual leukemia lacks the p55 TNFR.","['Markey, Kate A', 'Burman, Angela C', 'Banovic, Tatjana', 'Kuns, Rachel D', 'Raffelt, Neil C', 'Rowe, Vanessa', 'Olver, Stuart D', 'Don, Alistair L J', 'Morris, Edward S', 'Pettit, Allison R', 'Wilson, Yana A', 'Robb, Renee J', 'Randall, Louise M', 'Korner, Heinrich', 'Engwerda, Christian R', 'Clouston, Andrew D', 'Macdonald, Kelli P A', 'Hill, Geoffrey R']","['Markey KA', 'Burman AC', 'Banovic T', 'Kuns RD', 'Raffelt NC', 'Rowe V', 'Olver SD', 'Don AL', 'Morris ES', 'Pettit AR', 'Wilson YA', 'Robb RJ', 'Randall LM', 'Korner H', 'Engwerda CR', 'Clouston AD', 'Macdonald KP', 'Hill GR']","['Queensland Institute of Medical Research, Brisbane, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090929,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,2009/10/01 06:00,2010/01/22 06:00,['2009/10/01 06:00'],"['2009/10/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/22 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)30115-4 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2009-01-199927 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 Jan 7;115(1):122-32. doi: 10.1182/blood-2009-01-199927.

Based on distinct kinetic patterns, interclonal heterogeneity was also observed. Specifically, 4 patients exhibited a delayed appearance of newly produced CD38+ cells in the blood, higher leukemic cell CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) levels, and increased risk for lymphoid organ infiltration and poor outcome. Our data refine the proliferative compartment in CLL based on CD38 expression and suggest a relationship between in vivo kinetics, expression of a protein involved in CLL cell retention and trafficking to solid tissues, and clinical outcome.","['Calissano, Carlo', 'Damle, Rajendra N', 'Hayes, Gregory', 'Murphy, Elizabeth J', 'Hellerstein, Marc K', 'Moreno, Carol', 'Sison, Cristina', 'Kaufman, Matthew S', 'Kolitz, Jonathan E', 'Allen, Steven L', 'Rai, Kanti R', 'Chiorazzi, Nicholas']","['Calissano C', 'Damle RN', 'Hayes G', 'Murphy EJ', 'Hellerstein MK', 'Moreno C', 'Sison C', 'Kaufman MS', 'Kolitz JE', 'Allen SL', 'Rai KR', 'Chiorazzi N']","['The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, North Shore-Long Island Jewish Health System, Manhasset, NY, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090929,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,PMC2925477,2009/10/01 06:00,2010/01/13 06:00,['2009/10/01 06:00'],"['2009/10/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/13 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)38897-2 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2009-05-219634 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2009 Nov 26;114(23):4832-42. doi: 10.1182/blood-2009-05-219634.

In the present study, immunoblotting and reverse transcription-PCR demonstrated expression of IGF1R and IR isoform A in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) cell lines as well as in >80% of clinical AML isolates. Treatment with insulin enhanced signaling through the Akt and MEK1/2 pathways as well as survival of serum-starved AML cell lines. Conversely, treatment with BMS-536924, a dual IGF1R/IR kinase inhibitor that is undergoing preclinical testing, inhibited constitutive receptor phosphorylation as well as downstream signaling through MEK1/2 and Akt. These changes inhibited proliferation and, in some AML cell lines, induced apoptosis at submicromolar concentrations. Likewise, BMS-536924 inhibited leukemic colony formation in CD34+ clinical AML samples in vitro. Collectively, these results not only indicate that expression of IGF1R and IR isoform A is common in AML but also show that interruption of signaling from these receptors inhibits proliferation in clinical AML isolates. Accordingly, further investigation of IGF1R/IR axis as a potential therapeutic target in AML appears warranted.","['Wahner Hendrickson, Andrea E', 'Haluska, Paul', 'Schneider, Paula A', 'Loegering, David A', 'Peterson, Kevin L', 'Attar, Ricardo', 'Smith, B Douglas', 'Erlichman, Charles', 'Gottardis, Marco', 'Karp, Judith E', 'Carboni, Joan M', 'Kaufmann, Scott H']","['Wahner Hendrickson AE', 'Haluska P', 'Schneider PA', 'Loegering DA', 'Peterson KL', 'Attar R', 'Smith BD', 'Erlichman C', 'Gottardis M', 'Karp JE', 'Carboni JM', 'Kaufmann SH']","['Departments of Medicine and Oncology, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, Rochester, MN 55905, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090929,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,PMC2762752,2009/10/01 06:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/10/01 06:00'],"['2009/10/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['0008-5472.CAN-09-0511 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-09-0511 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2009 Oct 1;69(19):7635-43. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-09-0511.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: In this phase I, open-label, dose-escalation study, patients received 35 to 160 mg of dasatinib twice daily in 28-day cycles either every 12 hours for 5 consecutive days followed by 2 nontreatment days every week (5D2) or as continuous, twice-daily (CDD) dosing. RESULTS: Sixty-seven patients were treated (5D2, n = 33; CDD, n = 34). The maximum tolerated doses were 120 mg twice daily 5D2 and 70 mg twice daily CDD. DLTs with 160 mg 5D2 were recurrent grade 2 rash, grade 3 lethargy, and one patient with both grade 3 prolonged bleeding time and grade 3 hypocalcemia; DLTs with 120 mg twice daily CDD were grade 3 nausea, grade 3 fatigue, and one patient with both grade 3 rash and grade 2 proteinuria. The most frequent treatment-related toxicities across all doses were nausea, fatigue, lethargy, anorexia, proteinuria, and diarrhea, with infrequent hematologic toxicities. Pharmacokinetic data indicated rapid absorption, dose proportionality, and lack of drug accumulation. Although no objective tumor responses were seen, durable stable disease was observed in 16% of patients. CONCLUSION: Dasatinib was well tolerated in this population, with a safety profile similar to that observed previously in leukemia patients, although with much less hematologic toxicity. Limited, although encouraging, preliminary evidence of clinical activity was observed. Doses of 120 mg twice daily (5D2) or 70 mg twice daily (CDD) are recommended for further studies in patients with solid tumors.","['Demetri, George D', 'Lo Russo, Patricia', 'MacPherson, Iain R J', 'Wang, Ding', 'Morgan, Jeffrey A', 'Brunton, Valerie G', 'Paliwal, Prashni', 'Agrawal, Shruti', 'Voi, Maurizio', 'Evans, T R Jeffry']","['Demetri GD', 'Lo Russo P', 'MacPherson IR', 'Wang D', 'Morgan JA', 'Brunton VG', 'Paliwal P', 'Agrawal S', 'Voi M', 'Evans TR']","['Ludwig Center, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA. gdemetri@partners.org']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090929,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,,2009/10/01 06:00,2009/12/23 06:00,['2009/10/01 06:00'],"['2009/10/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/23 06:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-09-0224 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-09-0224 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2009 Oct 1;15(19):6232-40. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-09-0224.

Here, we show that a 6-week course of weekly administration of doxorubicin (2 mg/kg), followed 24 hours later by the bisphosphonate zoledronic acid (100microg/kg), causes substantial inhibition of MDA-MB-436 breast tumor burden in bone of immunocompromised mice, compared with administration of the single agents. Molecular analysis of tumors from animals treated sequentially with doxorubicin followed by zoledronic acid showed reduced numbers of proliferating tumor cells and decreased expression of cyclins E1, B, D1, and D3 as well as cdk2 and cdk4. Tumors from the sequential treatment group also displayed increased levels of apoptosis, increased expression of bcl2-associated X protein, decreased expression of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia/lymphoma 2, and activation of caspase 3, 8, and 9. Zoledronic acid caused a small reduction in tumor volume, reduced tumor cell proliferation, and decreased expression of cyclins D1 and D3, compared with tumors from animals treated with saline or doxorubicin. Doxorubicin had no effect on tumor growth, cell cycle, or apoptosis in vivo, but did cause increased accumulation of a bisphosphonate in MDA-MB-436 cells in vitro, suggesting that doxorubicin may affect subsequent uptake of zoledronic acid. In support of this, accumulation of unprenylated Rap1A, a surrogate marker of zoledronic acid, was only detected in tumors following sequential treatment, and not following treatment with zoledronic acid alone. Our data are the first to show the specific molecular pathways by which sequential treatment with doxorubicin and zoledronic acid induce tumor cell apoptosis and inhibit proliferation in an in vivo model of breast tumor growth in bone.","['Ottewell, Penelope D', 'Woodward, Julia K', 'Lefley, Diane V', 'Evans, C Alyson', 'Coleman, Robert E', 'Holen, Ingunn']","['Ottewell PD', 'Woodward JK', 'Lefley DV', 'Evans CA', 'Coleman RE', 'Holen I']","['Academic Unit of Clinical Oncology, School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, University of Sheffield, Beech Hill Road, Sheffield, S10 2RX, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090929,United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,,2009/10/01 06:00,2010/01/13 06:00,['2009/10/01 06:00'],"['2009/10/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/13 06:00 [medline]']","['1535-7163.MCT-09-0462 [pii]', '10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-09-0462 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2009 Oct;8(10):2821-32. doi: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-09-0462.

Such complications are potentially preventable. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess diagnosis- and treatment-dependent risk of hypogonadism in male childhood cancer survivors (CCS). DESIGN: Male CCS who were treated during the period 1970-2002 and who in 2004 were 18-45 yr of age were eligible. SETTING: The study was conducted in a university hospital clinic. PATIENTS: A consecutive group of CCS treated at Lund University Hospital was selected for the study, of whom 151 (38%) agreed to participate. Furthermore, 141 healthy fertile men served as controls. INTERVENTIONS: We measured serum levels of free and total testosterone, SHBG, and LH. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Odds ratios (OR) for biochemical hypogonadism, defined as total testosterone less than 10 nmol/liter and/or LH above 10 IU/liter, were calculated and related to type of cancer, treatment received, as well as testicular volume. RESULTS: Hypogonadism was more commonly detected in CCS than in controls (OR, 6.7; 95% CI, 2.7, 17). The increased presence of hypogonadism was noted in the following treatment groups: brain surgery, chemotherapy (with and without radiotherapy), and testicular irradiation. Low total testicular volume (<or=24 ml) was associated with a high risk of hypogonadism (OR, 31; 95% CI, 11, 92). CONCLUSION: Adult male survivors of childhood cancer are at risk of hypogonadism, which should be acknowledged in the long-term follow-up of these men.","['Romerius, Patrik', 'Stahl, Olof', 'Moell, Christian', 'Relander, Thomas', 'Cavallin-Stahl, Eva', 'Wiebe, Thomas', 'Giwercman, Yvonne Lundberg', 'Giwercman, Aleksander']","['Romerius P', 'Stahl O', 'Moell C', 'Relander T', 'Cavallin-Stahl E', 'Wiebe T', 'Giwercman YL', 'Giwercman A']","['Departments of Pediatrics, Lund University Hospital, Lund SE-221 85, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090929,United States,J Clin Endocrinol Metab,The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,0375362,,2009/10/01 06:00,2010/01/08 06:00,['2009/10/01 06:00'],"['2009/10/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/08 06:00 [medline]']","['jc.2009-0337 [pii]', '10.1210/jc.2009-0337 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Endocrinol Metab. 2009 Nov;94(11):4180-6. doi: 10.1210/jc.2009-0337.

We find that autophagy is suppressed in NB4 cells treated by sodium selenite, as measured by electron microscope, acridine orange staining and western blot. Moreover, selenite combined with autophagy inhibitor contributes to the up-regulation of apoptosis, while the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway is down- regulated. Consistently, when the inhibitor of PI3K was applied, the autophagic level significantly decreased. In summary, sodium selenite increases NB4 cell apoptosis by autophagy inhibition through PI3K/Akt, and the inhibition of autophagy contributes to the up-regulation of apoptosis.

Currently, only two monoclonal antibodies - the anti-CD33 immunotoxin gemtuzumab ozogamicin and the CD52-directed antibody alemtuzumab - are approved for treatment of relapsed acute myeloid leukaemia in older patients and B cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, respectively. Although not approved for such treatment, alemtuzumab is also active against T cell prolymphocytic leukaemia, cutaneous T cell lymphoma and Sezary syndrome, and adult T cell leukaemia and lymphoma. In addition, rituximab has demonstrated activity against B cell chronic lymphocytic and hairy cell leukaemia. Monoclonal antibodies targeting CD4, CD19, CD20, CD22, CD23, CD25, CD45, CD66 and CD122 are now being studied in the clinic for the treatment of leukaemia. Here, we discuss how these new antibodies have been engineered to reduce immunogenicity and improve antibody targeting and binding. Improved interactions with Fc receptors on immune effector cells can enhance destruction of target cells through antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and complement-mediated cell lysis. The antibodies can also be armed with cellular toxins or radionuclides to enhance the destruction of leukaemia cells.","['Morris, John C', 'Waldmann, Thomas A']","['Morris JC', 'Waldmann TA']","['Metabolism Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD 20892-1457, USA. jmorris@mail.nih.gov']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', 'Review']",20090930,England,Expert Rev Mol Med,Expert reviews in molecular medicine,100939725,PMC7294739,2009/10/01 06:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/10/01 06:00'],"['2009/10/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S1462399409001215 [pii]', '10.1017/S1462399409001215 [doi]']",epublish,Expert Rev Mol Med. 2009 Sep 30;11:e29. doi: 10.1017/S1462399409001215.,,IM,"['Adult', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*therapeutic use', 'Antigens, CD/immunology', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/immunology/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Factors/*therapeutic use', 'Immunotoxins/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia/immunology/*therapy']",193,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Immunologic Factors)', '0 (Immunotoxins)']",,,['Z01 BC010603/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],,,['NIHMS1591177'],,,,,,,,,,

Three groups of male CD rats received either saline (control group, I), a dose of Escherichia coli O7:K1 lethal to 90% of the animals (LD90) (septic group, II), or an LD90 dose of E. coli that was incubated with the human promyelocytic leukemia cell line (HL-60) (differentiated into the granulocytic direction) for 20 min prior to infusion (second septic group, III). The animals were observed for seven days. Pre-treatment with HL-60 cells resulted in no adverse effects in the group III animals. Significantly lower bacterial counts and endotoxin levels in the plasma were detected after 24 h as compared to group II (P < 0.05). Group III animals had better weight gain and more stable hemodynamics than group II animals (P < 0.01).

In recent years, advances in basic biology have provided a clearer picture of how BIM kills cells and how BIM expression and activity are repressed by growth factor signalling pathways, especially the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 and protein kinase B pathways. In tumour cells these oncogene-regulated pathways are used to counter the effects of BIM, thereby promoting tumour cell survival. In parallel, a new generation of targeted therapeutics has been developed, which show remarkable specificity and efficacy in tumour cells that are addicted to particular oncogenes. It is now apparent that the expression and activation of BIM is a common response to these new therapeutics. Indeed, BIM has emerged from this marriage of basic and applied biology as an important mediator of tumour cell death in response to such drugs. The induction of BIM alone may not be sufficient for significant tumour cell death, as BIM is more likely to act in concert with other BH3-only proteins, or other death pathways, when new targeted therapeutics are used in combination with traditional chemotherapy agents. Here we discuss recent advances in understanding BIM regulation and review the role of BIM as a mediator of tumour cell death in response to novel oncogene-targeted therapeutics.","['Gillings, Annette S', 'Balmanno, Kathryn', 'Wiggins, Ceri M', 'Johnson, Mark', 'Cook, Simon J']","['Gillings AS', 'Balmanno K', 'Wiggins CM', 'Johnson M', 'Cook SJ']","['Laboratory of Molecular Signalling, The Babraham Institute, Babraham Research Campus, Cambridge, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20090929,England,FEBS J,The FEBS journal,101229646,,2009/10/01 06:00,2009/10/29 06:00,['2009/10/01 06:00'],"['2009/10/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/29 06:00 [medline]']","['EJB7329 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1742-4658.2009.07329.x [doi]']",ppublish,FEBS J. 2009 Nov;276(21):6050-62. doi: 10.1111/j.1742-4658.2009.07329.x.

This CRET process occurs from donor luminol to acceptor fluorescein, which is oxidized by H(2)O(2) and catalyzed by HRP. DNA aptamer for ATP is first attached on the surface of magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs). The cDNA linker has an extension that hybridizes with two other DNAs (LumAuNP-DNA and F-DNA) or three other DNAs (HRP-DNA, LumAuNP-DNA, and F-DNA) to fabricate CRET-BMBP-MNP or CRET-TMBP-MNP conjugates that provide the CRET signals. Thus, in the absence of ATP, when the MNPs are removed from the solution, they also take with them the linker DNA and the CRET signal probes, and no CRET signal can be detected. However, when ATP is introduced, a competition for the ATP aptamer between ATP and the cDNA linker occurs. As a result, CRET-BMBP and CRET-TMBP are forced to dissociate from the MNP surface based on the structure switching of the aptamer. The CRET signals are proportional to the concentration of ATP. In order to accelerate the rate of the aptamer structure-switching process, an invader DNA is introduced into the proposed strategy. The present CRET system provides a low detection limit of 1.1 x 10(-7) and 3.2 x 10(-7) M for ATP detection by BMBP and TMBP, respectively, which also exhibits a good selectivity for ATP detection. Sample assays of ATP in K562 leukemia cells and 4T1 breast cancer cells confirm the reliability and practicality of the protocol, which reveal a good prospect of this platform for biological sample analysis.","['Zhang, Shusheng', 'Yan, Yameng', 'Bi, Sai']","['Zhang S', 'Yan Y', 'Bi S']","['Key Laboratory of Eco-chemical Engineering, Ministry of Education, College of Chemistry and Molecular Engineering, Qingdao University of Science and Technology, Qingdao 266042, PR China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Anal Chem,Analytical chemistry,0370536,,2009/10/01 06:00,2010/01/29 06:00,['2009/10/01 06:00'],"['2009/10/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/10/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/ac901759g [doi]'],ppublish,Anal Chem. 2009 Nov 1;81(21):8695-701. doi: 10.1021/ac901759g.,21,IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/*analysis', 'Aptamers, Nucleotide/*chemistry', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer/*methods', 'Fluorescent Dyes/*chemistry', 'Horseradish Peroxidase/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/metabolism', 'Luminescent Measurements/*methods', 'Magnetics', 'Nanoparticles/chemistry', 'Oligonucleotide Probes/*chemistry']",,"['0 (Aptamers, Nucleotide)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Oligonucleotide Probes)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'EC 1.11.1.- (Horseradish Peroxidase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Genomic DNA was extracted from malignant and non-malignant liver from 37 Australian and 24 South African HCCs and histologically normal liver from 20 transplant donors.

The highest prevalence of AI was observed at 9p (69%) and 17p (52%). AI was significantly higher in South African HCCs (p<0.05). The prevalence of promoter methylation of the six genes was significantly higher in Australian cases in both malignant and non-malignant liver tissue (p<0.05).

Simple addition of copper can resume sensitivity of high-density leukemic cells to DSF and improve efficiency of anti-leukemic therapies using this drug, thus providing benefit to patients with high WBC count.","['Navratilova, Jarmila', 'Jungova, Pavla', 'Vanhara, Petr', 'Preisler, Jan', 'Kanicky, Viktor', 'Smarda, Jan']","['Navratilova J', 'Jungova P', 'Vanhara P', 'Preisler J', 'Kanicky V', 'Smarda J']","['Department of Experimental Biology, Faculty of Science, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Greece,Int J Mol Med,International journal of molecular medicine,9810955,,2009/09/30 06:00,2009/12/23 06:00,['2009/09/30 06:00'],"['2009/09/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3892/ijmm_00000277 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Mol Med. 2009 Nov;24(5):661-70. doi: 10.3892/ijmm_00000277.,5,IM,"['Acetylcysteine/pharmacology', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Copper/*pharmacology', 'Culture Media, Conditioned', 'Disulfiram/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Space/drug effects/metabolism', 'Ions', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology']",,"['0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Ions)', '789U1901C5 (Copper)', 'TR3MLJ1UAI (Disulfiram)', 'WYQ7N0BPYC (Acetylcysteine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The results revealed that CGZ (10-50 micromol/l) inhibited the growth of leukemia NB4 cells and caused apoptosis in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Apoptosis was observed clearly by flow cytometry (FCM) and DNA fragmentation analysis. After treatment by CGZ for 48 h, the percentage of disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential (Deltapsim) was increased in a dose-dependent manner. Western blotting demonstrated the cleavage of caspase-3 zymogen protein and a time-dependent cleavage of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). The results also demonstrated that PPAR-gamma expression was increased concomitantly when apoptosis occurred, and that CGZ-induced apoptosis was inhibited by the PPAR-gamma antagonist GW9662, suggesting a PPAR-gamma dependent signaling pathway in CZG-induced cell death. Moreover, CGZ treatment remarkably downregulated the expression of the X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP), which was inhibited by GW9662. Of note, a small-molecule XIAP antagonist (1396-12) mimicked the effect of CGZ-induced apoptosis via activation of caspase-3, 7 and 9. The apoptosis-inducing effects by CGZ on fresh APL cells were also found to be remarkable by using FCM and Wright's staining observation. Taken together, our results suggest that downregulation of XIAP and activation of capase-3 play an important role in mediating the PPAR-gamma-dependent cell death induced by CGZ in APL cells. These data provide a novel insight into potential therapeutic strategies for treatment of leukemia.","['Liu, Jia-Jun', 'Guo, Yun-Wei', 'Fang, Zhi-Gang', 'Si, Xiao-Ning', 'Wu, Xiang-Yuan', 'Liu, Pei-Qing', 'Lin, Dong-Jun', 'Xiao, Ruo-Zhi', 'Xu, Yan', 'Wang, Chun-Zhi', 'Li, Xu-Dong', 'He, Yi', 'Huang, Ren-Wei']","['Liu JJ', 'Guo YW', 'Fang ZG', 'Si XN', 'Wu XY', 'Liu PQ', 'Lin DJ', 'Xiao RZ', 'Xu Y', 'Wang CZ', 'Li XD', 'He Y', 'Huang RW']","['Department of Hematology, The Third Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, 510630, PR China. jiajunliu2002@yahoo.com.cn']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Greece,Int J Mol Med,International journal of molecular medicine,9810955,,2009/09/30 06:00,2009/12/23 06:00,['2009/09/30 06:00'],"['2009/09/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3892/ijmm_00000273 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Mol Med. 2009 Nov;24(5):623-32. doi: 10.3892/ijmm_00000273.,5,IM,"['Anilides/pharmacology', 'Aniline Compounds/pharmacology', '*Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Shape/drug effects', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/enzymology/*pathology', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/metabolism', 'PPAR gamma/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Phenylurea Compounds/pharmacology', 'Protease Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Staining and Labeling', 'Survivin', 'Thiazolidinediones/pharmacology', 'X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism']",,"['0 (2-chloro-5-nitrobenzanilide)', '0 (Anilides)', '0 (Aniline Compounds)', '0 (BIRC5 protein, human)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0', '(N-(6-((anilinocarbonyl)amino)-5-((anilinocarbonyl)((1-(4-cyclohexylbutyl)pyrroli', ""din-2-yl)methyl)amino)hexyl)-N-methyl-N'-phenylurea)"", '0 (PPAR gamma)', '0 (Phenylurea Compounds)', '0 (Protease Inhibitors)', '0 (Survivin)', '0 (Thiazolidinediones)', '0 (X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'U8QXS1WU8G (ciglitazone)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We recently reported that CD44 promotes progenitor homing into the thymus and T-cell maturation and now elucidate the molecular mechanisms of CD44-supported thymocyte maturation. Lethally irradiated, tumor-bearing mice, allogeneically reconstituted with T-cell-depleted BMC and a small number of common lymphoid progenitor 2 cells (CLP2) from transgenic (TG) mice, that express ratCD44v4-v7 under the Thy1 promoter, showed accelerated immunocompetent T-cell recovery compared with mice reconstituted with non-transgenic (NTG) CLP2. In addition, graft-versus-host disease was strongly reduced after tumor vaccination. TG, but not NTG double-negative (DN) thymocytes showed high proliferative potential, accompanied by constitutive association of lck with CD44. Importantly, when thymocyte adhesion was strengthened by anti-CD44, co-cultures of DN thymocytes with thymic stroma supported DN thymocyte maturation. The close contact between DN thymocytes and thymic stroma promoted persisting activation of lck and ERK1/2, particularly in CD44v6(+) DN thymocytes. Thus, intrathymic T-cell maturation in allogeneically reconstituted, leukemia-bearing hosts can be considerably accelerated by high CD44v6 expression in early thymocytes, in which proliferation-supporting signals are initiated by a crosstalk between CD44v6 on thymocytes and panCD44 on the thymic stroma.","['Rajasagi, Mohini', 'Marhaba, Rachid', 'Vitacolonna, Mario', 'Zoller, Margot']","['Rajasagi M', 'Marhaba R', 'Vitacolonna M', 'Zoller M']","['Department of Tumor Cell Biology, University Hospital of Surgery and German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090929,United States,Immunol Cell Biol,Immunology and cell biology,8706300,,2009/09/30 06:00,2010/05/19 06:00,['2009/09/30 06:00'],"['2009/09/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/19 06:00 [medline]']","['icb200970 [pii]', '10.1038/icb.2009.70 [doi]']",ppublish,Immunol Cell Biol. 2010 Feb;88(2):136-47. doi: 10.1038/icb.2009.70.

To date, the function of autophagy in cell differentiation is poorly documented. Here, we investigated the possibility that megakaryocytic differentiation of the Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (CML) cell line K562, a process known to be accompanied by accumulation of vacuoles inside the cells, might involve autophagy. Using various complementary approaches, we show that the combination of the phorbol ester PMA and the p38(MAPK) inhibitor SB202190 (SB), which engaged a majority of K562 cells towards the megakaryocytic lineage, also triggered vacuolization and autophagy. The combination of PMA + SB appears to induce both increase in autophagic fluxes and an autophagic degradation blockage. Induction of autophagy was accompanied also by increased expression of Beclin 1 and p62/SQSTM1 and was found to precede the onset of megakaryocytic differentiation. Moreover, knockdown of LC3 and Beclin 1 by specific siRNAs impaired PMA + SB-mediated vacuolization, LC3-II accumulation and megakaryocytic differentiation, as well. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first description that induction of autophagy is involved in megakaryocytic differentiation of K562 CML cells.","['Colosetti, Pascal', 'Puissant, Alexandre', 'Robert, Guillaume', 'Luciano, Frederic', 'Jacquel, Arnaud', 'Gounon, Pierre', 'Cassuto, Jill-Patrice', 'Auberger, Patrick']","['Colosetti P', 'Puissant A', 'Robert G', 'Luciano F', 'Jacquel A', 'Gounon P', 'Cassuto JP', 'Auberger P']","['Inserm U895, Team 2: Cell Death Differentiation and Cancer, Nice, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091124,United States,Autophagy,Autophagy,101265188,,2009/09/30 06:00,2010/02/23 06:00,['2009/09/30 06:00'],"['2009/09/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/23 06:00 [medline]']","['9889 [pii]', '10.4161/auto.5.8.9889 [doi]']",ppublish,Autophagy. 2009 Nov;5(8):1092-8. doi: 10.4161/auto.5.8.9889.

We carried out a study to investigate survival and factors affecting survival of all diagnostic types of second primary brain or spinal cord neoplasms. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The British Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (BCCSS) is a long-term population-based follow-up study of 17,980 5-year survivors of childhood cancer. We used relative survival and multivariate Cox regression analysis to determine 5-year relative survival and factors affecting survival in second primary meningiomas and gliomas that developed in survivors included in the BCCSS. RESULTS: There were 247 second primary brain or spinal cord neoplasms, including 137 meningiomas and 73 gliomas in a young adult population. Five-year relative survival after meningiomas was similar for males (84.0%; 95% CI, 72.6% to 91.1%) and females (81.7%; 95% CI, 69.9% to 89.3%). For gliomas, 5-year relative survival was 19.5% (95% CI, 8.6% to 33.7%) for males and females. Multivariate analysis showed significant heterogeneity by decade of treatment (P = .04), grade (P = .03), and genetic risk (P = .03) for rate of mortality after a meningioma. For gliomas, survival was significantly affected by grade (P < .001). CONCLUSION: Our results indicate survival is poor after second primary glioma in this young adult population, although survival after second primary meningioma is good.

We aimed to define an accelerated phase (AP) in MF by characterizing disease features that can identify patients with median overall survival of <or= 12 months at any time in the disease course. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Baseline characteristics of 370 consecutive patients with MF from a single center were analyzed to identify features associated with a median overall survival of <or= 12 months. These putative AP features were then validated by following the course of chronic-phase patients (no AP features at baseline) until the development of one or more AP features and determining their subsequent survival. RESULTS: The following three characteristics were associated with poor survival at baseline and were selected as putative AP features: blasts in blood or bone marrow >or= 10%, platelets less than 50 x 10(9)/L, and chromosome 17 aberrations (median overall survival, 10, 12, and 5 months, respectively). In the validation phase, chronic-phase patients who developed AP features during follow-up were found to have short subsequent survival times (median overall survival, 12, 15, and 6 months, respectively). AP was a necessary step in the progression to blast phase, with leukemic transformation being exceedingly rare (3% risk at 10 years) in patients who remained persistently in chronic phase. CONCLUSION: Blood or bone marrow blasts >or= 10%, platelets less than 50 x 10(9)/L, and chromosome 17 aberrations defined AP in patients with MF.

Whereas PI3Ks are critical for B-cell activation, the functions of TAPP proteins in B cells are unknown. We have identified 40 potential interaction partners of TAPP2 in B cells, including proteins involved in cytoskeletal rearrangement, signal transduction and endocytic trafficking. The association of TAPP2 with the cytoskeletal proteins utrophin and syntrophin was confirmed by Western blotting. We found that TAPP2, syntrophin, and utrophin are coexpressed in normal human B cells and B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) cells. TAPP2 and syntrophin expression in B-CLL was variable from patient to patient, with significantly higher expression in the more aggressive disease subset identified by zeta-chain-associated protein kinase of 70 kDa (ZAP70) expression and unmutated immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) genes. We examined whether TAPP can regulate cell adhesion, a known function of utrophin/syntrophin in other cell types.

Fifty-eight patients older than 50 years with advanced acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) were treated with (131)I-BC8 Ab and fludarabine plus 2 Gy total body irradiation. Eighty-six percent of patients had AML or MDS with greater than 5% marrow blasts at the time of transplantation. Treatment produced a complete remission in all patients, and all had 100% donor-derived CD3(+) and CD33(+) cells in the blood by day 28 after the transplantation. The MTD of (131)I-BC8 Ab delivered to liver was estimated to be 24 Gy. Seven patients (12%) died of nonrelapse causes by day 100. The estimated probability of recurrent malignancy at 1 year is 40%, and the 1-year survival estimate is 41%. These results show that CD45-targeted radiotherapy can be safely combined with a reduced-intensity conditioning regimen to yield encouraging overall survival for older, high-risk patients with AML or MDS.

To assess the impact of prophylaxis on colonization and the development of resistance in Saccharomyces yeasts, identification and susceptibility testing were performed with yeasts cultured at regular intervals from mouth, throat, and stool samples. Prior to therapy, 34 to 50% of the subjects were colonized with yeasts. For all three drugs, the number of positive Candida albicans cultures decreased during drug therapy. In contrast, the proportion of subjects with positive C. glabrata cultures increased by two- and fourfold in the posaconazole and itraconazole arms, respectively. Likewise, in the fluconazole arm the proportion of subjects with positive C. krusei cultures increased twofold. C. glabrata was the species that most frequently exhibited decreases in susceptibility, and this trend did not differ significantly between the prophylactic regimens. For the subset of subjects from whom colonizing C. glabrata isolates were recovered at the baseline and the end of treatment, approximately 40% of the isolates exhibited more than fourfold increases in MICs during therapy. Molecular typing of the C. albicans and C. glabrata isolates confirmed that the majority of the baseline and end-of-treatment isolates were closely related, suggesting that they were persistent colonizers and not newly acquired. Overall breakthrough infections by Candida species were very rare (approximately 1%), and C. glabrata was the colonizing species that was the most frequently associated with breakthrough infections.","['Mann, Paul A', 'McNicholas, Paul M', 'Chau, Andrew S', 'Patel, Reena', 'Mendrick, Cara', 'Ullmann, Andrew J', 'Cornely, Oliver A', 'Patino, Hernando', 'Black, Todd A']","['Mann PA', 'McNicholas PM', 'Chau AS', 'Patel R', 'Mendrick C', 'Ullmann AJ', 'Cornely OA', 'Patino H', 'Black TA']","['Schering-Plough Research Institute, Kenilworth, NJ 07033, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",20090928,United States,Antimicrob Agents Chemother,Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,0315061,PMC2786324,2009/09/30 06:00,2010/02/02 06:00,['2009/09/30 06:00'],"['2009/09/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/02 06:00 [medline]']","['AAC.01031-09 [pii]', '10.1128/AAC.01031-09 [doi]']",ppublish,Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2009 Dec;53(12):5026-34. doi: 10.1128/AAC.01031-09.

PKA isoform II activation appeared to be involved in inhibition of proliferation but not induction of apoptosis in HL-60 cells. Inhibition of CREB function protected against this anti-leukaemic effect with higher efficiency than enforced Bcl-2 expression. Preclinical studies employing the rat AML model Brown Norwegian Myeloid Leukaemia also indicated anti-leukaemic activity of the combination therapy in vivo.

The combined use of esculetin and HA14-1 effectively induced Bid cleavage and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP, Deltapsi(m)) leading to the activation of caspases and cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) in Bcl-2-overexpressing (U937/Bcl-2) cells. Combined treatment with esculetin and HA14-1 upregulated the expression of death receptor 4 (DR4), and activation of extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK) in a time-dependent manner. In addition, esculetin and HA14-1-mediated apoptosis was reduced by ERK inhibitors through inhibition of DR4 expression, suggesting that the synergistic effect was at least partially mediated through ERK-dependent induction of DR4 expression. The results indicate that HA14-1-induced reversal of the anti-apoptotic effect of Bcl-2 confers apoptosis sensitivity to esculetin by a mitochondrial amplification step and through the ERK-dependent induction of DR4 expression in U937/Bcl-2 cells. Thus, HA14-1 reversal of Bcl-2-mediated esculetin resistance suggests a novel strategy for increasing esculetin sensitivity in Bcl-2-overexpressing leukemia cells.","['Park, Cheol', 'Jin, Cheng-Yun', 'Kwon, Hyun Ju', 'Hwang, Hye Jin', 'Kim, Gi-Young', 'Choi, Il Whan', 'Kwon, Taeg Kyu', 'Kim, Byung-Woo', 'Kim, Wun-Jae', 'Choi, Yung Hyun']","['Park C', 'Jin CY', 'Kwon HJ', 'Hwang HJ', 'Kim GY', 'Choi IW', 'Kwon TK', 'Kim BW', 'Kim WJ', 'Choi YH']","['Blue-Bio Industry Regional Innovation Center, Dongeui University, Busan 614-714, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090926,England,Toxicol In Vitro,Toxicology in vitro : an international journal published in association with BIBRA,8712158,,2009/09/30 06:00,2010/06/03 06:00,['2009/09/30 06:00'],"['2009/06/10 00:00 [received]', '2009/08/08 00:00 [revised]', '2009/09/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/09/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/03 06:00 [medline]']","['S0887-2333(09)00284-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.tiv.2009.09.017 [doi]']",ppublish,Toxicol In Vitro. 2010 Mar;24(2):486-94. doi: 10.1016/j.tiv.2009.09.017.

However, kinases inhibited by dasatinib are also involved in the induction and regulation of innate immunity. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of dasatinib on cytokine secretion in response to toll-like receptor (TLR) stimulation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Dasatinib-treated mice were administered intraperitoneally with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and serum cytokine (tumor necrosis factor-alpha [TNF-alpha], interleukin [IL]-10, and IL-6) levels and neutrophil accumulation in the lungs were analyzed. Cytokine secretions (TNF-alpha and IL-6) from TLR3-, TLR4-, and TLR9-stimulated RAW264.7, as well as TLR4- and TLR9-stimulated bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) were also evaluated. RESULTS: Dasatinib-treated mice had reduced serum levels of TNF-alpha in response to LPS administration; however, other inflammatory hallmarks of systemic LPS administration, such as secretion of IL-6 and accumulation of neutrophils in the lung, were unaffected. In contrast to the reduced TNF-alpha levels, dasatinib treatment increased serum levels of IL-10 following LPS administration. The production of TNF-alpha was also impaired in vitro in response to TLR3, TLR4, and TLR9 stimulation of the mouse macrophage cell line RAW264.7, as well as TLR4 and TLR9 stimulation of BMDM; IL-6 production was also impaired in dasatinib-treated BMDM. CONCLUSIONS: These findings further support the ability of dasatinib to modulate the host immune response and highlights scope for off-target applications of dasatinib for the control of TNF-alpha-mediated inflammatory disorders.","['Fraser, Cara K', 'Lousberg, Erin L', 'Kumar, Raman', 'Hughes, Timothy P', 'Diener, Kerrilyn R', 'Hayball, John D']","['Fraser CK', 'Lousberg EL', 'Kumar R', 'Hughes TP', 'Diener KR', 'Hayball JD']","['Hanson Institute, South Australia, Australia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20090926,Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,,2009/09/30 06:00,2010/01/07 06:00,['2009/09/30 06:00'],"['2009/07/23 00:00 [received]', '2009/08/31 00:00 [revised]', '2009/09/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/09/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/07 06:00 [medline]']","['S0301-472X(09)00387-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2009.09.007 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2009 Dec;37(12):1435-44. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2009.09.007.

In order to determine the origin of human fibroblasts, we established a method for culturing fibroblasts from human peripheral blood (PB) mononuclear cells and studied fibroblasts from gender-mismatched HSC transplant recipients and patients with untreated Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We cultured PB cells from three female subjects who showed near-complete hematopoietic reconstitution from transplantation of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor-mobilized male PB cells and examined the resulting fibroblasts using fluorescent in situ hybridization for Y chromosome. Because the mobilized PB cells may contain mesenchymal stem cells, we could not determine the HSC or mesenchymal stem cell origin of the fibroblasts seen in culture. To further document the HSC origin of human fibroblasts, we next examined fibroblasts from two patients with untreated CML, a known clonal disorder of HSCs. RESULTS: All cultured fibroblasts from female recipients of male cells showed the presence of Y chromosome, indicating the donor origin of fibroblasts. Cultured fibroblasts from the CML patients revealed the presence of BCR-ABL translocation. This demonstration provided strong evidence for the HSC origin of human fibroblasts because CML is a clonal disorder of the HSC. CONCLUSIONS: These studies strongly suggest that human fibroblasts are derived from HSCs. In addition, the results suggest that fibrosis seen in patients with CML may be a part of the clonal process.","['Shirai, Keisuke', 'Sera, Yasuhiko', 'Bulkeley, William', 'Mehrotra, Meenal', 'Moussa, Omar', 'LaRue, Amanda C', 'Watson, Dennis K', 'Stuart, Robert K', 'Lazarchick, John', 'Ogawa, Makio']","['Shirai K', 'Sera Y', 'Bulkeley W', 'Mehrotra M', 'Moussa O', 'LaRue AC', 'Watson DK', 'Stuart RK', 'Lazarchick J', 'Ogawa M']","['Department of Medicine, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20090926,Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,PMC2802494,2009/09/30 06:00,2010/01/07 06:00,['2009/09/30 06:00'],"['2009/09/23 00:00 [received]', '2009/09/23 00:00 [revised]', '2009/09/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/09/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/07 06:00 [medline]']","['S0301-472X(09)00388-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2009.09.008 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2009 Dec;37(12):1464-71. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2009.09.008.

It has been documented that ABCB1 and ABCG2 interact with several first-generation, small-molecule, tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), including the Bcr-Abl fusion kinase inhibitor imatinib, used for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukaemia. Here, we have investigated the specific interaction of these transporters with nilotinib, dasatinib and bosutinib, three clinically used, second-generation inhibitors of the Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase activity. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: MDR-ABC transporter function was screened in both membrane- and cell-based (K562 cells) systems. Cytotoxicity measurements in Bcr-Abl-positive model cells were coupled with direct determination of intracellular TKI concentrations by high-pressure liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and analysis of the pattern of Bcr-Abl phosphorylation. Transporter function in membranes was assessed by ATPase activity. KEY RESULTS: Nilotinib and dasatinib were high-affinity substrates of ABCG2, and this protein mediated an effective resistance in cancer cells against these compounds. Nilotinib and dasatinib also interacted with ABCB1, but this transporter provided resistance only against dasatinib. Neither ABCB1 nor ABCG2 induced resistance to bosutinib. At relatively higher concentrations, however, each TKI inhibited both transporters. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: A combination of in vitro assays may provide valuable preclinical information for the applicability of novel targeted anti-cancer TKIs, even in multidrug-resistant cancer. The pattern of MDR-ABC transporter-TKI interactions may also help to understand the general pharmacokinetics and toxicities of new TKIs.","['Hegedus, C', 'Ozvegy-Laczka, C', 'Apati, A', 'Magocsi, M', 'Nemet, K', 'Orfi, L', 'Keri, G', 'Katona, M', 'Takats, Z', 'Varadi, A', 'Szakacs, G', 'Sarkadi, B']","['Hegedus C', 'Ozvegy-Laczka C', 'Apati A', 'Magocsi M', 'Nemet K', 'Orfi L', 'Keri G', 'Katona M', 'Takats Z', 'Varadi A', 'Szakacs G', 'Sarkadi B']","['Membrane Research Group of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, National Blood Center and Semmelweis University, Budapest, Hungary.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090928,England,Br J Pharmacol,British journal of pharmacology,7502536,PMC2785536,2009/09/30 06:00,2010/01/20 06:00,['2009/09/30 06:00'],"['2009/09/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/20 06:00 [medline]']","['BPH383 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1476-5381.2009.00383.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Pharmacol. 2009 Oct;158(4):1153-64. doi: 10.1111/j.1476-5381.2009.00383.x.

Current approaches for immunotoxin development are dependent on existing antibodies that were selected for high affinity and/or high production yield. However, these antibodies may demonstrate low internalization efficiency upon cell surface binding and thus are not necessarily the best candidates for immunotoxin design. Here, we have developed an assay with a novel protein, DTG3, to compare and evaluate the internalization efficiency of monoclonal antibodies in order to circumvent the possibility of low internalization. DTG3 is a fusion protein containing the N-terminus of diphtheria toxin (DT) and three copies of streptococci Protein G immunoglobulin binding domains. We show that antibody-DTG3 complexes formed in the test tube are able to bind their antigen on the target cell surface, resulting in cell internalization, DT-mediated protein synthesis inhibition, and host cell apoptosis. We tested this system with two well-studied antibodies, antihuman CD3epsilon, and anti-PSMA antibodies and were able to show efficiency of this assay. We further examined commercially available anti-CD123 antibodies for potential leukemia-targeting immunotoxin development. Finally, we applied this system in the early-stage screening of newly generated anti-CD123 hybridomas. Our data showed that this internalization assay system is sensitive, time efficient, and reproducible, and has provided a tool to compare monoclonal antibodies for the clinical development of effective immunotoxins for the treatment of a variety of neoplasms.","['Kuo, Shu-Ru', 'Alfano, Randall W', 'Frankel, Arthur E', 'Liu, Jen-Sing']","['Kuo SR', 'Alfano RW', 'Frankel AE', 'Liu JS']","['Cancer Research Institute of Scott & White Hospital and Department of Internal Medicine, Health Science Center, College of Medicine, Texas A&M University, 5701 South Airport Road, Temple, TX 76502, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090928,United States,Bioconjug Chem,Bioconjugate chemistry,9010319,,2009/09/30 06:00,2011/04/02 06:00,['2009/09/30 06:00'],"['2009/09/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/04/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/bc900333j [doi]'],ppublish,Bioconjug Chem. 2009 Oct 21;20(10):1975-82. doi: 10.1021/bc900333j.

Most chemokines act through heptahelical transmembrane G protein- coupled receptors. Based on their molecular structure these cytokines are divided into the two major subgroups CCL and CXCL chemokines that bind to CCR or CXCR receptors respectively. Primary human acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) cells show constitutive release of a wide range of chemokines, but the chemokine release profile differs between patients. Among the commonly expressed chemokines are proangiogenic CXCL8, antiangiogenic CXCL4/9-11 and several leukocyte-chemotactic chemokines. Systemic serum levels of leukocyte-chemotactic chemokines depend both on patient age, disease status, the chemotherapy regimen and development of complicating infections. The local chemokine network in human AML is probably further modulated by the hypoxic bone marrow microenvironment and the local release of chemokines by nonleukemic bone marrow stromal cells. Usually primary AML cells also express several chemokine receptors. Specific chemokine inhibitors are now being developed, including chemokine-neutralizing or receptor-blocking antibodies, antisense strategies, receptor-blocking small molecules or inhibitors of downstream signaling. The use of CXCR4-antagonists for mobilization of peripheral blood stem cells has been documented in several clinical studies. Although animal studies suggest that chemokine inhibition also may become useful in the treatment of graft versus host disease, the possible use of chemokine-targeting therapy for other indications than stem cell mobilization requires further studies.","['Olsnes, A M', 'Hatfield, K J', 'Bruserud, O']","['Olsnes AM', 'Hatfield KJ', 'Bruserud O']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Haukeland University Hospital and The University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Cyprus,J BUON,Journal of B.U.ON. : official journal of the Balkan Union of Oncology,100883428,,2010/01/27 06:00,2010/04/28 06:00,['2009/09/29 06:00'],"['2009/09/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/28 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,J BUON. 2009 Sep;14 Suppl 1:S131-40.,,IM,"['Chemokines/genetics/*physiology', 'Chemokines, CC/genetics/physiology', 'Chemokines, CXC/genetics/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-8/genetics/physiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/physiopathology/*therapy', 'Neovascularization, Physiologic/physiology', 'Receptors, Chemokine/genetics/physiology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology']",84,"['0 (Chemokines)', '0 (Chemokines, CC)', '0 (Chemokines, CXC)', '0 (Interleukin-8)', '0 (Receptors, Chemokine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PLAP(+) vascular-like patches were formed following transplantation into both newborn and adult recipient mice, although their frequency was reduced in adult recipients. Confocal analysis of multiple labeled tissues revealed that whereas most liver and heart PLAP(+) vascular patch-associated cells were endothelial, PLAP(+) vascular patches in the kidney contained endothelial, hematopoietic, and putative hemangioblastic cells. Moreover, fluorescence-activated cell sorting assays showed that only FL PLAP(bright+) donor cells can generate PLAP(+) vascular patches upon transplantation.

The aim of this study was to describe the compliance of post-chemotherapy revaccination of childhood cancer survivors relative to current Australian guidelines. PROCEDURES: A multi-faceted retrospective review of childhood cancer survivors at the Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne, Australia was undertaken. Immunisation status was reviewed through four sources: (1) hospital records; (2) telephone survey of consenting participants; (3) Australian Childhood Immunization Register (ACIR); and (4) family practitioners immunisation records. Participants were 0-18 years, and at least 6 months post-treatment for their cancer. RESULTS: The study was conducted between March and September 2006. Eighty-nine patients with a median age at diagnosis of 5.3 years were included, 56% of patients had a diagnosis of leukaemia and 44% solid tumours. The median duration since completion of therapy was 3.1 years. Reviewing all sources, 39% (35/89) of participants had no evidence of booster vaccinations post-completion of therapy. Younger age (P = 0.001), and those diagnosed with leukaemia (P = 0.04) were more likely to have received at least one booster vaccine. Forty-seven percent (42/89) had received at least one influenza vaccination.
